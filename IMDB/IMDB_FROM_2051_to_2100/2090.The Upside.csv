0,SnoopyStyle,it gets better,8,16 September 2019,"Dell Scott (Kevin Hart) has always been about himself. He's on parole and all he cares about is getting signatures for his employment sheet. He doesn't care about the jobs and accidentally stumbles into a job interview. Philip Lacasse (Bryan Cranston) is a billionaire quadriplegic in need of a live-in caretaker. He is bitter at still being alive after his business assistant Yvonne Pendleton (Nicole Kidman) disobeyed his DNR. He is depressed from the death of his wife and the hopelessness of his condition. Dell is struggling to get back into his estranged son's life.This is adapted from the 2011 French film The Intouchables which is a flawed movie with a sincere message. In my opinion, this remake is far superior to the French original. The original is mostly about race and class. While that is part of the issue in the new movie, it is mostly about Dell's criminal past and his irresponsible attitude that is the center of the premise. That is a far more effective personal drama. As for the acting, it's expected from Cranston and Kidman while Hart is a big surprise. He needs to do a few more dramas. That's not to say that this is in any way a perfect movie. There are several moments when the old clichés go too far. The opera is one of those moments. Dell's conversion is obvious and expected. The movie needs to add something to distract from its inherent conventional nature. I would add a line with Dell saying, ""You didn't tell me that she was going to be sista."" I really like switching out the egg for the book. I really like the relationships. I love Julianna Margulies' scene. I really like this movie.",The Upside
1,Hitchcoc,"At Times a Little Too Easy, but I Enjoyed It",8,2 February 2019,"To start with, I am a huge Brian Cranston fan, and not just for ""Breaking Bad."" He has that interesting demeanor and physicality that I like in actors. Here, he is the quadriplegic mega-rich man who made a foolish decision to para-glide in bad weather. He also lost his wife to cancer. He is angry, continuing to live in the world he created while carrying incredible guilt. Kevin Hart is the man who comes along with every wart you can imaging. An ex convict, a thief, a user, a child support cheat. But he is able to connect with Cranston, much to the chagrin of his financial secretary, Nicole Kidman. Hart's character must learn to do all the dirty jobs required to take care of this guy. They clash, but it's often funny, and he give Cranston a reason to smile again. If there's a criticism, it's that the two get into a routine awfully quickly. There is one bitter disappointment that is really hard to watch, when a woman who has been corresponding with the guy decides to meet him. Very tense. Overall, I really can't understand criticism based on a movie that may have been superior. A true critic wouldn't do that. It would be like judging a new version of Les Miserables based on one done in 1935.",The Upside
2,nogodnomasters,I-Deal,7,3 February 2019,Dell Scott (Kevin Hart) is a loser ex-con needing his three signatures for his parole officer. He is hired as a caregiver for real billionaire quadriplegic Phillip Lacasse (Bryan Cranston). Nicole Kidman plays umpire.This is your typical odd-couple formula. Phillip learns to love life again and Kevin Hart learns that Aretha sang opera. Very vanilla type film.Guide: No swearing. Brief sex. No nudity.,The Upside
3,classicsoncall,"""Don't you see potential here?""",7,27 September 2019,"Even after watching the entire movie, I had no idea it was a remake of the 2011 film ""The Intouchables"", so I had to go back to my older reviews to know if I'd seen and commented on it. Turns out I had, but have no memory of it now since it was about five years ago and I watch a different picture just about every day. What struck me here was seeing a totally different side to comedian Kevin Hart, who managed to restrain some of his more manic comedy into a subdued effort as the caregiver of reclusive quadriplegic millionaire, Philip Lacasse (Bryan Cranston). The story has any number of poignant moments that may elicit a tear or two, and quite a few triumphant ones as well that inspire the former business consultant Lacasse to understand that life doesn't end when one loses a spouse or the use of one's limbs.I thought the filmmakers inserted a cleverly revealing scene right after Philip fired Dell Scott (Hart); it occurred when Dell arrived at the hoops court and one of his former associates said ""Welcome home, man"" - the same phrase mentioned by Dell when he first served a prison sentence and was greeted by his incarcerated father with the same words. Dell was having none of it, knowing there was no way he was returning to the streets that got him into trouble in the first place. It was a quick scene under the radar, but if you were paying attention earlier, the nuance was quite introspective.This was also one of those pictures that leaves the viewer with a resolution left open to interpretation. Having left Philip's employment following the disastrous dinner date with Lily Foley (Julianna Margulies), the former administrator of Lacasse's affairs, Yvonne (Nicole Kidman) is brought back into the fold by Dell Scott, he himself having brought Philip out of his deep funk at the suggestion of physical therapist Maggie (Golshifteh Farahani). I might be off base about this, but I like to think that Yvonne was in love with Philip the entire time, and that this was the opportunity for Philip to realize that too. And if I'm wrong, it was still a happy ending.",The Upside
4,tavm,The Upside was quite a touching Kevin Hart-Bryan Cranston movie,8,10 February 2019,"Just watched this Kevin Hart-Bryan Cranston drama with my movie theatre-working friend just now. Hart plays someone who's estranged from his wife and young teen son. So he gets a job caring for Cranston who can't move except from the neck up. He's also fabulously wealthy. Nicole Kidman also takes care of Cranston and is an ""umpire"" for Hart. I'll just now say this was quite touching with some humorous elements from Hart who does fine in his first dramatic role. There's also some good use of Aretha Franklin music here of whom this movie is dedicated in memory of. So on that note, me and my friend highly recommend The Upside.",The Upside
5,ferguson-6,not in line with the original,5,11 January 2019,"Greetings again from the darkness. Frequent movie goers often complain about the lack of originality in American movies. It sometimes seems as if most are sequels, remakes or reboots, or simply pulled from the panels of a comic book. There is another source that is particularly irksome to yours truly, and that's the Americanization of an outstanding film from another country - World Cinema, if you will. Seven plus years ago, while watching the crowd-pleasing (though not so critically acclaimed) and exceptionally performed 2011 French film THE INTOUCHABLES, there was little doubt that it would, at some point, be subjected to an American ""enhancement"". Sure enough, director Neil Burger (THE ILLUSIONIST) perfectly captures why this transition is sometimes so painful to see.Based on a true story, filthy rich quadriplegic widower Phillip Lacasse is played by Bryan Cranston, while Nicole Kidman (her 4th film in 8 weeks) plays Yvonne, Phillip's wound-too-tight, ultra-loyal chief of staff (she handles his many business affairs and calendar) with an obvious ulterior motive. Kevin Hart (he of recent Oscar-hosting drama) plays Dell, an unemployed ex-con street hustler. While searching for employment to appease his Parole Officer, Dell stumbles into a Park Avenue penthouse where Phillip and Yvonne are conducting interviews for a full-time caregiver to Phillip. Though he is woefully unqualified, and Yvonne protests mightily, Phillip chooses Dell. The undercurrent here is that Dell's self-centeredness corresponds nicely to Phillip's DNR and lack of will to live since his wife's death from cancer.The opening sequence has Dell racing through downtown, evading police, while driving a Ferrari with Phillip in the passenger seat. This is followed by a promising ""6 months earlier"" flashback introducing us to Dell's ex-wife (Aja Naomi King) and their teenage son Anthony (Jahi Di'Allo Winston), both of whom are fed up with the lack of support and trustworthiness of Dell. Basically, Dell is a deadbeat dad with little ambition - other than to avoid returning to prison.The tone of the film changes once Dell has the job as Phillip's carer. The bulk of the remaining run time (which is 20 minutes too long) becomes a comedy skit showcasing the punchlines of Kevin Hart. Mind you, the full house I watched the screening with seemed to love every bit, as laughter filled the theatre. For me, I could only long for the soul and spirit of that beloved French film from years ago ... and the amazing chemistry between the charismatic Omar Sy and the talented Francois Cluzet. This version isn't about chemistry - it's about comic timing. The only real exception to that is a terrific and psychologically deep scene with Julianna Margulies playing Phillip's pen pal, as they meet for the first time over lunch. The scene is played beautifully, but is a complete tonal change from what comes before and after. Contrasting this scene with Kevin Hart's over-the-top antics in the high-tech shower, magnifies the contrast in concepts.Jon Hartmere is credited with the screenplay based on the original film's screenplay by Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakache. For some reason, Phillip Pozzo di Borgo's autobiography doesn't make the credits for this version. A bit more attention to Dell's ex and son could have worked to humanize him, and soften the caricature on display. This comes across as an interracial odd-fellow buddy flick, where yet another black man (often in a subservient role) rescues an entitled white person (even if they're disabled) from lack of hope and leads them to a life worth living. Is it possible to make a movie based on race and class, and even romance, and still offer no real insight? Apparently the answer is yes, if one chooses to go for easy laughs. Perhaps you'll join the audience in rolling along with Dell's first trip to the opera, or the disrespect to art collectors - or that seemingly never-ending catheter scene. Or perhaps you can be persuaded to track down THE INTOUCHABLES for a more emotional and inspirational telling of this story.",The Upside
6,phd_travel,Funny and enjoyable,8,2 April 2019,Given the story it's as funny and well made as it can be. Some parts are obviously formula. But it's very enjoyable. The class and culture differences make for some laugh out loud jokes. The music differences are cute. The modern art thing is really funny. Some semi serious moments.Nicole looks very slim and young in her nerdy get up. Bryan does a sympathetic job. Kevin Hart does great delivery it could have been corny but with him it's right like Oda Mae. Julianna Margulies looks different from before here.Worth a watch.,The Upside
7,DKosty123,A Good Solid Film,7,10 November 2019,"I have looked at the reviews here and I see a whole lot of discourse about this being a remake of a French film. Being negative about remakes is a stupid thing. In fact it takes ignorance to do that. There are so many movies that are remade, that very often unless your an educated person you don't realize a film is a remake.For example, Ben Hur was made as a classic silent in 1925. In 1959, it was totally remade as a sound film. Both films are classics and in many ways exact copies of one another. I would dare say, anyone who would say well the first one is silent and the other is sound, even though they are pretty much exact duplicates has mental illness. Hey, the greatest scene of both films, the chariot race, was borrowed by George Lucas for a sci-fi film. Yet that is not what the Lucas film is criticized for. So why are we criticizing this film for being a copy of another film?Well, I have not seen the original. If it is an exact copy, it is not such a bad thing to copy. After all, the story is positive and upbeat. Kevin Hart is restrained into a serious role. Bryan Cranston is great as the quadrolpolgic. Nicole Kidman is great in her most restrained dramamtic role. Neil Burger and the rest of the cast does very well supporting the story. Even though the French film, and this one are based upon a true story, there is some fiction mentioned in the films credits.If it is scene for scene taken from the French film, then the French film has some problems as there are times the film action either stagnates or stops. I assume if it copies the French film, than that one stops too? I have a feeling that is not the case. n fact, one reviewer says the French film does the same beginning and flash back scenee as this one. If it does, that is a shame as I think the story would actually play better with out this opening, so why does the French film do it? Even this film would be better without it.What really impresses me is Hart being willing to do a serious role for a change. Like the original painting his character creases in this film, both of these things should be ""encouraged."" It's painfully obvious after seeing this film that yes, Hart can be a dramatic actor.",The Upside
8,ElMaruecan82,"The story didn't change, but our times did...",7,15 April 2020,"When IMDb came out with the news about Amazon remaking the French box-office hit and universally acclaimed ""Untouchables"", the response it immediately elicited was ""what for?"". Now that the film's done, the answer still carries the same tone of puzzlement.Now I'm not the kind to cringe over the idea of Americanizing a French film, many remakes proved to be, if not successful, interesting retakes on pre-known stories with new outlines or insights. But then again, ""Untouchables"" was so recent, so big, and so popular (being the most successful French film in worldwide box-office) that I couldn't think of a single reason that could justify the remake, but maybe the interest lies precisely in its status as a remake and the fact that it stars two talents such as Bryan Cranston and Kevin Hart (with Nicole Kidman as the third-billed name). Speaking for myself, it was good enough a reason to grab my interest.But from the start the film was doomed, its production was delayed due to the Weinstein scandal (the film was produced by Miramax at the time it ceased to be an Awards-magnet) and it took two years to be finally released. It was an honorable box-office success but met with mostly negative critics. To be quite honest, I don't find any aspect to criticize nor that I have any reason to praise the film, the two actors inhabit their characters with confidence and humility and their chemistry comes out as believable and never overplayed. Cranston delivers a fine performance as Phlip LaCasse from New York's upper class and Kevin Hart, while not having the towering charisma or the catchy smile of Omar Sy, has a presence of his own as the man from the Bronx. Neither of the two actors go for easy pathos of laugh, like their French counterparts.Script-wise, the story is a carbon-copy of the original, minus some elements: Philip is the same widower, victim of a paragliding accident but has no daughter. However, Dell is divorced and has a son whose constant frowning insists a bit too much that he wasn't exactly a Chris Gardner. Dell's flirting with one of Phillip's caretakers doesn't end with the 'obvious' twist (as if there hadn't to be a reason not to succumb to his charm, unlike for Sy) while the other romantic subplot involving the epistolary relationship ends in a negative note unlike the original. Apart from that, we've got the obsession with the Opera, the painting, the dancing and the shaving sequence though the reference to Chaplin seemed to imply the change of mentalities from 2011 to 2019.The ""Chaplin"" moustache isn't just a detail, I wanted to blame the film for sugarcoating the gag but then I realized that maybe times have changed from 2011 to 2019, and the contextualization isn't a detail either. Indeed, it's rather interesting to see that the critics the film met didn't accuse the performances but elements such as the predictability of the plot: how could Opera soothe a street-smart thug? (well, didn't a simple exchange about basketball in the laundry room changed Ed Norton in ""American History X""?), the critics also pinpointed the use of clichés regarding the depiction of minorities but I was wondering whether these faults were also brought up against the original. In all fairness, the late Roger Ebert did and I could get his point though I disagreed.In fact, I think the film is an easy scapegoat, and its biggest fault wasn't much to be a remake but to allow a material that got away with many handicaps thanks to its status as a foreign production to be immediately put under the firing squad of political correctness. What was tolerable a few years earlier became in the post-""Moonlight"" days pure manipulative melodrama. In an ironic way, ""Untouchables"" did carry its own title and was immune to critics while ""The Upside"" down could be flipped all over the place. It goes even further as the film was criticized for not starring a real handicapped person, a criticism the original escaped from. And while I can understand the reaction, is the blame to be put on Cranston?Right now, I'm puzzled because I did enjoy the film to the degree that it kept reminding me of the original while still being a new experience, and I believe the two lead actors did justice to their roles. So, I'm tempted to say that the film reveals the real hypocrisy of our times and the way what was still acceptable in the early 2010s became taboo, and the way American cinema can be more criticized for the kind of stuff most foreign productions get away with . At least Ebert had the guts to go against the stream with the first ""Untouchables"" but it seems like critics are choosing the wrong target because ""The Upside"" is such a copy of the first that any critic directed at it is a critic against the original. And I'm not exactly dismissing the 'handicap' argument because that might have allowed the film to open a new breach but the film was so doomed from the start that critics might have call it hypocritical or publicity stunt.It's sad because on its own, it's a solid drama served with good performances, nothing changed much in the story, but our times have changed, and political correctness doesn't make them better. So, in a way, the remake does belong to another era and reveals the upside of our own mentalities. So I guess the film served a purpose after all.",The Upside
9,bowmanblue,Uplifting little number,8,18 August 2019,"Apparently, 'The Upside' is a remake of a foreign film and - as is traditional - everyone that's seen the original source material claims that this new version isn't a patch on it. However, seeing as I've never watched this - alleged - 'masterpiece,' I can only comment on this latest incarnation. And I really enjoyed it.Kevin Hart, best known for his 'larger than life' comedic performances, plays 'Dell Scott,' a (semi) reformed criminal, released from jail and now looking for work. This could lead to all sorts of wacky adventures that Hart would be excellent to show us. However, anyone who's seen his previous work will find this role slightly 'toned down.' And he's all the better for it. That's not to say that he's not funny. Although all his best moments are when he's up against Mr Breaking Bad himself, Bryan Cranston, or Philip Lacasse - Scott's new employer.As far-fetched as it may sound, Lacasse is a rich man who is wheelchair-bound and unable to move from the neck down. He - for reasons you'll find out - employs Scott as his live-in carer, thus creating one hell of an 'odd couple' setting.What follows is pure, yet subtle, comic gold. There may not be so many 'laugh out loud' moments, but it's the little looks each character gives each other that make it worth watching. Plus the jokes, although some may be - slightly - 'adult' in nature, are never crude and this film could almost be watched by anyone who's interested in what is effectively a film about two broken people who have to learn from each other how to behave as a fully-rounded emotional human being.Anyone who's seen Cranston's work will know he's a fine actor and 'The Upside' allows him to continue to flex his acting ability. Hart, best known for just shouting and being over the top, also shines as a more broken, sympathetic and flawed character who we will root for to see him fix his problems with his life. Nicole Kidman doesn't have quite as much screen time as the two men, but she's actually quite good, too. She also has a bit of a 'character arc' which is nice to watch, as she also grows.'The Upside' is also - apparently - based on 'real' events. Again, I haven't looked into how much we see here is actually 'real,' but I don't care. It's simply a nice, heart-warming story with messages about life and learning from people who - on first impressions - are completely different to us and someone we may not choose to associate with. If it does have a flaw I would say that it's a little longer than it needed to be. I thought it was going to end about a quarter of an hour before it did. Then, when it did end, it kind of ended quite abruptly. However, that's a minor gripe. There's plenty here to enjoy if you fancy a break from superhero movies.",The Upside
10,jack_o_hasanov_imdb,Watchable,7,28 August 2021,"As a matter of fact, I was angry when I saw that there was this movie. The French movie was very good. I haven't watched this movie for a long time. But while it wasn't perfect, it wasn't a terrible movie either. Since it's Bryan and Kevin, I think it's a watchable adaptation.",The Upside
11,UniqueParticle,Genuine nurturing film about a quadraplegic,8,6 July 2019,"Bryan Cranston is easily one of the most badass actors ever because of Breaking Bad, and this is a complete opposite character where he can't walk or do most things. Kevin Hart is great in drama roles, he should do them more. I barely found this funny at all, except a few chuckle worthy moments. Also I really enjoy one of the director's other films Limitless, Neil Burger is very good at his craft! I remember reading this getting hate, I don't get it with this movie, it has a moment of racism in the beginning otherwise this is a heartwarming cozy movie and I am glad I waited to see by renting it at my nearest library!",The Upside
12,cruise01,Great performances but dull direction and predictable story.,6,30 May 2019,"The Upside (3 out of 5 stars).The Upside is a decent comedy drama film based on a true story about an ex con Dell (Kevin Hart) who is trying to deal with parole and wanting to see his son again. And he gets a job in assisting a wealthy quadriplegic Philip (Bryan Cranston). Philip was involved in a paragliding accident that left him paralyzed. Dell is the rough street personality in trying to see his son again. Seeing the two on screen together is a perfect combo and chemistry. The film has its charms and a predictable plot. It is worth watching the two on screen performances deal with each other.The plot is predictable. You have two distinct different characters that are wanting different things in life. Dell is dealing with finding a job and getting the chance to fix his relationship with his son. Philip is depressed that he is unable to live his life without anyone helping him. He has been messaging some mysterious lady that has a thing for him. But they have not met nor seen each other. Dell and Philip soon become friends and trying to change each other lives. It is a heart felt story but you have seen were the direction is going to go from there.The direction by Neil Burger is a bit dull though. The script and direction feels flat. Like it is one of those movies were you can see only once. Kevin Hart is great and playing a serious role. After seeing him doing many comedy films and being the comic relief in everything he does. Hart taking on a serious role, he can deliver. Sure, the film does have some fun humor. Bryan Cranston is also good as well playing Philip. A wealthy man that is depressed after being stuck to the chair and needing an assistant to live his life.Overall, The Upside is a fair comedy drama film. The plot is predictable. The direction and writing are flat and dull. The acting performances from Bryan Cranston and Kevin Hart is great.",The Upside
13,eddie_baggins,A surprisingly tolerable remake,6,8 September 2019,"Firstly, if for whatever reason you are reading this review and have never seen 2011's The Intouchables, one of the biggest French films of all time and one of the most likeable films you're likely to have the pleasure of watching, stop reading right now and track down a copy, you'll thank me later, trust me.The true story of quadriplegic millionaire Philippe Pozzo di Borgo and his friendship with his anything but ordinary carer Abdel Sellou was fabulously told by filmmakers Olivier Nakache and Éric Toledano in The Intouchables and many would be right in thinking that the French film was most definitely not crying out for a Hollywood remake.As is the case with the billionaire dollar industry however, The Intouchables has found itself being re-hashed for a subtitle hating American audience in the form of The Upside (which was a surprise box-office hit in the USA earlier in 2019), with Illusionist and Divergent filmmaker Neil Burger and his cast lead by the Oscar seeking Bryan Cranston, comedian Kevin Hart and Australian darling Nicole Kidman taking on the beloved true story.Filmed many moons ago and held back due to the Weinstein saga and some mediocre early festival release reviews, The Upside is surprisingly tolerable and far better than it has any right to be, which isn't to say its anywhere near as good as its far better early offering that managed to be both hilariously honest and moving in a much stronger sense than is to be found here.Gone are the subtleties, laugh out loud and tear inducing moments from The Intouchables and welcomed in are sign-posted plot and character developments, caricatures, mild chuckles and some slightly moving moments in Burger's effort, that keeps the core of the story in tact but never expands or delves too heavily into the themes and motivations that would've helped The Upside feel like more of a memorable addition to this true life tale.Importantly for the film, Cranston and Hart make for a likeable double act, Cranston's as good here as his been post Breaking Bad as the forlorn Philip, while perhaps most surprisingly Hart is relatively restrained as the criminal turned straight shooting Dell Scott, who begins to open up the world of Philip while also learning important life lessons himself.It's a shame Burger couldn't of mined more from this double act as the two's relationship and on screen chemistry is only ever surface deep, an issue that was never a problem for The Intouchables that got the most out of its star double act in the form of François Cluzet and Omar Sy, who bought the house down by fully inhabiting the mismatched duo and bringing them to life in fun and unexpected ways.Final Say -A generic offering that's very much the lesser feature film of the touching story of two oddball friends, The Upside is watchable and often enjoyable thanks to its true life tale and lead performers but far from memorable or necessary.3 high-tech bathrooms out of 5",The Upside
14,matthewssilverhammer,Substantially Passable,6,18 January 2019,"The Upside is an apt title; for every negative ""downside"", there is also a positive ""upside"" to counter it. For every lame joke, there's one that hits. For every forced emotion, there's genuine pathos around the corner. For each subpar performance, there's a Kidman or Cranston to carry the scene. And for all the saccharine levels of corn, there's an effective hit of sweetness stirred by the chemistry between characters. It's a substantially passable little film that just barely works in each way that it needs to.
Based on the true unusual pairing of a released convict (Hart) hired to care for a rich quadriplegic (Cranston), it's what we expect from adult-centric comedy-dramas, minus the use of cheap and ineffective montages that are such a crutch for most meet-cute friendship films. Instead, it takes time to slow down in multiple moments to let the characters and scenes really breathe. Cranston is expectedly good, but Hart surprises in a more subdued role than we normally see from him while still getting his moments to blow-up, recalling Seth Rogen's turn in 50/50. When it's funny, it's very funny (the catheter scene is a standout), while the ""overcoming limitations"" message and performances lead to a true affection for this odd couple.
The platitudes are lame and aplenty. The characters make unnatural leaps to fulfill what the script needs at each moment. The director employs suspect film tropes to no purpose (why do filmmakers insist framing their movies with a late-story scene at the beginning of their movie?). Still, genuine feel-good, crowd-pleaser movies are rare these days, so what the heck. Gimme the dowsides if they accompany comedy and heart this satisfying.",The Upside
15,paul-allaer,Joyless (and pointless) Hollywood remake of the French classic,2,15 January 2019,"""The Upside"" (2017 release; 126 min.) brings the story of Dell and Phillip. As the movie opens, Dell is speeding through Manhattan, and eventually pulled over by the cops. When ordered to get out of the car, Phillips, a quadriplegic, obviously does not move. Dell convinces the cops that Phillip is having a seizure and needs to get to a hospital, his reason for speeding. The cops believe him, much to the delight of Dell and Phillip. We then go to ""Six Months Earlier"", when Dell, just released from jail(we don't know why he was in jail), by happenstance is lined up by his Parole Officer for a job interview at Phillip's place. To say Phillip is rich would be the understatement of the year. While Phillip's business manager Yvonne does not care for Dell, Phillips sees something in him and offer his the job as live-in assistant. Dell reluctantly accepts as he needs the money badly... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: in 2011 a French movie called ""The Intouchables"" was released, to both critical and commercial acclaim (ultimately grossing over $400 million worldwide). It was a delightful movie from start to finish, with the two lead actors Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy having clear screen chemistry. The movie was a true ode to life and joy. It wasn't ling before Hollywood came knocking to do a remake. The remake sat in years of development hell, but finally premiered at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival, yes 18 months ago. Alas, that is when Harvey Weinstein, whose production company made the film, fell from grace and the movie disappeared overnight. Now finally comes the wide release. And the news is not good. As much as the original French film delights and brings joy, the US remake feels forced. Kevin Hart acts and looks pained as if he just got a root canal at the dentist. He is outright terrible. Not too mention that the penis and urine jokes are cringe-inducing (even more so given Hart's recently uncovered homophobic tweets of some years ago). Bryan Cranston does a little better. Nicole Kidman (as Yvonne) looks utterly lost and out of her element. The whole thing comes across utterly joyless, and frankly, pointless. The original French movie was (more than) perfectly fine, so why mess with a good thing? I'm sorry that I can't be more positive about this remake, and maybe Was was doomed from the start, having seen the original French version, now deemed to be a classic.As mentioned, ""The Upside"" opened nationally this past weekend, and did surprisingly well at the box office, considering everything. The Monday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended so-so (about 15 people). What really was remarkable is that I didn't hear a single roll of laughter during the entire movie... If you have seen ""The Intouchables"", you may want to stay away from ""The Upside"" but that's just my (subjective) view. As always, I encourage you to see this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",The Upside
16,lisafordeay,Actually not that bad(contains spoilers),6,22 January 2019,"The Upside came out in 2017 but wasn't released in Ireland or the states till 2019. The film is based on a true story and a remake of the 2011 film The Untouchables which was a French film starring Omar Sy. This version stars Kevin Hart,Bryan Cranston and Nicole Kidman and tells the story about this criminal named Del (Hart)who has to maintain a job from his parole officer. Del also happens to have a son from his ex wife who has enough of his behavior and wants to reconcile with him. Later Del finds a job which requires him to look after a quadrapedic wealthy man named Phillip(Cranston)who was in a bungee accident many years ago and is mourning the loss of his wife who died of cancer years prior. He has a helper with him played by Nicole Kidman who at first didn't want Del to get the job position but she later warms up to him as the time progresses.We later find that Phillip has a crush on a woman who he meets up with at a fancy restaurant but she didn't like him and he fires Del because of it. The film ends where Del buys a house for his ex wife and his son and Philip strikes a relationship with Nicole Kidman's character and the two bungee in the end.
Overall I was surprised by this film. At first I thought it was going to end up like that 2016 Romantic Drama Me Before You where the male character ends his life through suicide and got ALOT of controversy because of it.

The film is based on a true story and a remake of the 2011 film The Untouchables which was a French film starring Omar Sy. This version stars Kevin Hart,Bryan Cranston and Nicole Kidman and tells the story about this criminal named Del (Hart)who has to maintain a job from his parole officer. Del also happens to have a son from his ex wife who has enough of his behavior and wants to reconcile with him. Later Del finds a job which requires him to look after a quadrapedic wealthy man named Phillip(Cranston)who was in a bungee accident many years ago and is mourning the loss of his wife who died of cancer years prior. He has a helper with him played by Nicole Kidman who at first didn't want Del to get the job position but she later warms up to him as the time progresses.We later find that Phillip has a crush on a woman who he meets up with at a fancy restaurant but she didn't like him and he fires Del because of it. The film ends where Del buys a house for his ex wife and his son and Philip strikes a relationship with Nicole Kidman's character and the two bungee in the end.
The chemistry between Kevin Hart and Bryan Cranston was good. At first I thought this was going to be like Me Before You where the male character who also was a quadrapedic would end his life but in The Upside he didn't.The film also stars Taye Donovan from Hercules",The Upside

From the previews, you might get the impression that this movie is a comedy. It is, in parts, but it has a lot of drama, too. I guess you could say it is a humorous drama-or a dramatic comedy. It is based on a true story and it is also a remake of a French film from 2011 called 'The Intouchables'. Kevin plays an ex-con that is trying to find a job. He wants to spend more time with his son but his lack of a job-and money-keeps him from it. Plus, being a jailbird does not help him with the getting a job part. Then, he lucks out by showing up for a job interview that was unexpected, being a caretaker to Bryan. Bryan was in an accident that left him a quadriplegic-he can not move anything below his neck. Oh yeah, he is also filthy rich. Nicole is Bryan's assistant that does not think Kevin can handle the job. A wealthy disabled billionaire depending on a former criminal to help keep him alive? Julianna plays a romantic interest to Bryan-she corresponds with Bryan through letters, but has never met him face to face. At the end of the movie-as the end credits are about to start-you learn about their relationship since what was shown in the film.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for suggestive material and drug use and has a running time of 2 hours and 5 minutes.

Twain's ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN put this misunderstood group on the world's cultural map, and Mr. Kevin Hart courageously champions HUCK against all of the wrong-headed naysayers in recent Real Life America. It's no accident that ""Dell's"" Number One heroine is Detroit's ""Aretha Franklin,"" to whom this flick is explicitly dedicated. The Detroit Public Schools were the first major U.S. District of Color to ban HUCK from its buildings on the capricious whims of raving revisionists. Miss Franklin's Motown home base immediately lost two-thirds of its students (and half its population overall), and anyone who COULD joined HUCK in a mad rush toward the Motor City off ramp to escape this insanity. Detroit immediately went bankrupt, and Aretha soon died of a broken heart. Now, with THE UPSIDE's plot revolving around a signed first edition of HUCK, Mr. Hart is single-handedly leading the Movement to reinstall HUCK at the center of America's Urban Culture.

21,CubsandCulture,Failed Oscar bait but wonderful performances.,6,31 March 2019,"This odd couple dramedy of a rich, white, and disabled man befriending a poor, black, ex-convict has all the elements to make a real crowd pleasing film. Hart, in a very understated performance for him, makes a great rogue trying to get back on the straight and narrow. Cranston has an air of dignity and his performance has no-self pity in it. The film is relatively careful to avoid some common tropes of dealing with disability. Kidnman, meanwhile, gives a light airy performance that makes the most of her screen-time. Unfortunately, the screenplay is straight up awful.The plotting is hackneyed. Pretty much every big beat in the story is known about 15 minutes in. Moreover, far too much of the humor is inorganic to the characters. In stronger odd couple films the joy comes from seeing the clashing personalities. Here much of the humor is derived from Hart's fish out of water status which really isn't integrated into the plot. The film doesn't quite laugh at disability but it comes dangerously close a few times. There is a bluntness to the gags that while they mostly work comes across as cheap and lazy. The framing device used for the story unnecessarily complicates the drama. The script is so bad that it nearly sinks the film.The direction has a nice somber touch to it. I appreciated the attempts to get us into Philips' head space. The director largely stays out of the way and let's the actors work.This was a minor disappointment.",The Upside

25,kirbylee70-599-526179,EMOTIONALLY FULFILLING,10,25 June 2019,"In 2011 a French movie was released based on the true life story of a wealthy quadriplegic man and the ex-con he hired to be his caregiver. The movie was amazing and I wrote about it at the time, one of my favorite films that year. It isn't surprising that the film has been remade for American audiences and that film, THE UPSIDE, is just as amazing as the original.Kevin Hart plays Dell Scott, an ex-con in search of work and trying just to get papers signed showing he applied or he goes before a judge. Bryan Cranston plays Phillip Lacasse, a wealthy quadriplegic who waits around hoping to die. After firing his last ""life auxiliary"" caregiver his assistant Yvonne Pendleton (Nicole Kidman) is running through candidates for the job when Dell shows up. Actually there for a janitor's position in the same building he accidentally showed to this interview.While all he wants is to have his paperwork signed Phillip sees an opportunity. He tells Yvonne to hire Dell thinking that he will be incompetent enough that he might have the chance to die. At first not interested in the job, Dell changes his mind when he sees what it pays.As the two become acquainted with one another as well as the job that Dell has been hired to do they being to bond with one another. With each passing day Dell's exuberance and love of life begins to pour over into Phillip. While he can move nothing more than his head, Dell soon has him tooling around the park when he rigs the wheelchair Phillip owns to go much faster than intended.A night on the town where Dell gets Phillip stoned results in their stopping by a hot dog shop and ordering hot dogs for everyone. And it allows Phillip to let his hair down so to speak, to get back in touch with life. His life changed not just when he had his accident but also when his wife died of cancer. Breaking through that wall becomes the challenge that Dell faces.But as Dell changes Phillip the same happens to him. Exposed to opera for the first time he comes to appreciate it. Accompanying Phillip to an art gallery he learns to appreciate that as well and even tries to take up painting. And while Yvonne at first wanted to be rid of him she begins to see the benefits of having him around as well.Dell also has issues with his own life in the film. His ex is upset that he doesn't spend more time with his son. She holds his criminal past over him more so than Phillip does. And his son isn't too keen on him at the moment either. It will take time and effort for Dell to turn that problem around himself.An incident involving a woman Phillip writes to takes him back to his old self. Will the end result be his taking his own life somehow? Or will those that have come to know him for the person he really is come to his aid? Will Dell be able to bring Phillip out of his funk and show him the upside of life once more?Based on a true story the movie is touching, funny and heartbreaking. The stories of both Dell and Phillip as they relate to one another and in their own personal issues is one that should resonate with so many people. We've all had those moments where we just felt like we could no longer go on and yet we do somehow. But what if our positions were the same as these two men? Could we do so? Would we?Both actors here turn in amazing performances. Hart has been making movies for some time now and almost all of them nothing but comedies. Can he pull off a dramatic role like this one? The answer is absolutely. The humor that comes from the character isn't forced or like that of his stand up performances but flows naturally. Cranston shows his abilities as well here using nothing more than his face and head to portray Phillip. To be able to display emotions using no body movement and to make it believable is a distinct accomplishment.The odds are that this movie doesn't have enough social commentary to it, no agenda to push, no axe to grind that will insure that it isn't nominated for anything. That's too bad because for me this was one of the best movies I've seen this year. It's one that can be watched repeatedly and enjoyed. I would suggest that it move to the top of your list and watch it as soon as possible. You'll be glad you did.",The Upside

Otherwise I found every other character completely unbelievable in this mixed up plot. This flick drifts between being a melodrama, a comedy, a drama, an 'art film', etc.! Not one intention being fully achieved.And personally I found it very difficult to accept a fabulously rich man would hire one person to be on call 24/7 as his personal care aid. That alone requires a real stretch of disbelief. It would have had more believability if the disabled millionaire had one favorite caretaker with whom he connected more closely.",The Upside

That the retread differs from the original is surprisingly false. Even the first incarnation, a huge hit in France, suffered critical response that it was too much like a Hollywood film (which I guess upon hearing this, Hollywood thought they had carte blanche to mount an English language entry) but rest assured if you're fans of both actors, the new film plays well w/what the original had laid out. Directed concisely by journeyman director Neil Burger (Limitless/The Illusionist) w/o any surprises or notions of retooling what worked in the prior film almost guaranteed the successful reception the film has garnered.

What Cranston manages to do as a quadrapalegic is pretty impressive and Hart, in a largely non-comedic role is surprisingly solid. The story is touching and fascinating as it explores the dynamic of a struggling ex-con and a very rich man forming a pretty unique relationship.The cinematography is good, there's plenty of lovely shots and visuals. The pacing is good. The only thing I'd really call a detractor to the movie is Nicole Kidman's weird... I don't know if it's supposed to be an accent or what but it was very distracting. Still that's a relatively minor thing.And yet, despite all the good, this was a fairly middling experience. I honestly wish I had liked it more but that wasn't the case.

Welcome to another Robbie's Movie Reviews and today we hit the film:Movie: The Upside (2018 wide release date)Director:

LIKES:Acting Chemistry
Comedy
Balance of Comedy
Pace
Energy
The CarsSUMMARY:The Upside is a remake that really mirrors the predecessor, but brings the modern spin on it. Where the first installment was a little more artistic in the telling of the sad story, this remake has more energy and pacing to its approach. The Upside takes a sadder story and brings with it a fun adventure that tries to fight the darkness for much of the film. It reminded me of the presentation from the Bucket List and given some of the trips and cars that atmosphere adds to some of the entertainment value.
Yet the stars of the show really come in the comedy direction and the actors who bring it out. The Upside's comedy is not the usual Hart hat of tricks, which is usually yelling fanatically and shoving one-liners down your throat. Instead, the Upside focuses on putting the comedy into the story, preferring to time simple comedy antics and add a realistic conversational tone to it. The result, is a grounded comedy scheme that keeps things entertaining, all while keeping the film going. To make the jokes sparkle, the two leading actors bring their talents to the front, mixing their styles together in an acting favorable mixture that is the solid pillar of this film. Cranston's sarcasm and character focused approach works for this title, bringing dryer humor and some story to keep the film running. Hart on the other hand has really dropped to a more serious role, mixing his usual edgy delivery with a laxer approach. The two play-off of each other really well, building that buddy relationship that is always fun to join in on the adventure. It's the heart and soul of the movie, and fans of these two will probably enjoy this dynamic like I did.DISLIKES:Story components
Missing the Adventure component
Secondary Character Use
EditingSUMMARY:Ironically, the thing this movie has trouble living up to, is the storytelling aspect for me. Don't get me wrong, the movie has a solid story in terms of the buddy/buddy relationship of the film, but it doesn't quite maximize the potential of it or the backstory components. Some side stories about both characters histories are included for completion sake and give you the info you need, yet the film lacks the facing the impasses and trying to grow. As such, much of the problems are sort of swept under the rug in a solution like manner. Perhaps you are thinking the fun of the movie will offset it, and at times it does, but the Upside does not quite get to the same levels as the Bucket List for Me. The adventure is gone out of it for me, and while still entertaining, could have been maximized to offset the lackluster story elements.
In regards to the secondary character development... it is okay. Nicole Kidman was a plus, not quite fully utilized, but included enough to not overshadow the central characters, yet again not fully utilized when her backstory and involvement started to get into the mix. Hart's family characters, the rival, even the other supportive members of Phil's team were not as inclusive as I think they could have been. The result as you are hearing is again, the attempts at telling an all-inclusive story, but not quite delving into the details like they wanted.
As such, the main thing I had an issue with in the movie, was the editing/direction not quite coming together the way I expected from the trailer. It's not awful at all, but I think this production had a little trouble figuring out what direction it wanted to take the movie into. Enough inclusion to give you the story, but not enough to reach the full potential it's European cousin was able to tell years ago. Still, it is a fun adventure to say the least.
The VERDICT:Truth be told, I enjoyed the Upside and felt that I get a little something in each of the categories. It's funny, with great acting chemistry and energy to offset the sadness of the situation that the trailers painted. Yet, the buddy comedy we might have expected is not going to be to the full effect for most and the story elements could have used some bulking up to reach the expected magnitude I think it really wanted to go far. All in all though, this remake is certainly something to check out when you can, but I can't quite say it was the movie theater visit of the month (though it was the best of the four this week). As such, here are my scores:Comedy/Drama: 7.0
Movie Overall: 6.0",The Upside
33,rannynm,Wonderful Remake of the French Class with Well-Founded Laughs,9,12 January 2019,"The Upside is a wonderful, but very contrived remake of the French classic: The Intouchables. The superb main duo makes for a variety of heartfelt and well-found laughs. Anyone looking for a packed ""January movie"" will find a perfect outing.Inspired by an incredible true story, the movie follows a recently released ex-convict named Dell (Kevin Hart), as he seeks employment to do right by his family's financial needs and regain their trust. He finds the most unusual employment with an offer to care-take the paralyzed billionaire Phillip (Bryan Cranston). Most don't believe in Dell's capabilities, especially chief executive Yvonne (Nicole Kidman), with Dell failing, but slowly learning to care-take. Amidst this process, Dell and Phillip form an unlikely friendship and journey, bettering themselves.Kevin Hart, as Dell, is my favorite character, as he steps into newfound dramatic territory and delivers exceptionally. As always, his unique sense of humor remains and he is as better than ever with the amicable chemistry he shares with Bryan Cranston. Bryan Cranston, as Phillip, delivers a gravitas to his character when needed, as his condition make him hopeless. In only a way Cranston can deliver, his journey to regain hope and optimism through Dell is very compelling. It also helps that their unique banter is just so funny and intellectually executed. Nicole Kidman, as Yvonne, is another relatable character, as even she learns to smile from Dell, despite her disagreements. Her long history with Phillip is well sold, as well.Neil Burger serviceably directs the movie, with a great eye for scenery, even if many scenes fall within a repetitive layout at times. My favorite scene is the haircut scene, as it is a fun rendition of the classic French scene and even has more nuances of its own. The main problem with this movie comes from the fact that, in comparison to its French counterpart, there really isn't much of a difference with a few scenes and characters having some subtleties. At times, its pace even takes a hit and even the newer additions don't fare as well as the original. This can be viewed as a bit of a pro, as sticking with the original does prove to its advantage.The message of this film is that a friendship is a relationship most valued and will always remain irreplaceable. If we all get along, we will strive towards greatness and a happier mental well-being. I give this film 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18, because of some sexual references and brief drug use.Reviewed by Arjun Nair, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.",The Upside

Starring Kevin Hart, Bryan Cranston, Nicole Kidman, Golshifteh Farahani, Julianna Magulies, Aja Naomi King, Tate Donovan, Jahi Di'Allo Winston. (PG-13)Odd-couple schmaltz between black, struggling ex-con Hart and white, affluent quadriplegic Cranston; the latter hires the former to be his ""life auxiliary"" (despite being the least qualified candidate by far) and a tentative friendship is formed. Remake of sentimental French hit ""The Intouchables,"" and based on the real-life relationship between Philippe Pozzo di Borgo and Abdel Sellou; presents the sanitized version of events for maximum crowd-pleasing impact, alternating between mawkishness, gentle humor, cutesy moments, heavy-handed life lessons, and ""mismatched buddy"" clichés. Sub-plots involving Hart's family and the epistolary-turned-unmediated romance between Cranston and Margulies (with the underutilized Kidman as a downplayed third party) are too perfunctory and predictable to register. Neither lead performer is playing to their strengths, but Hart and Cranston both do serviceable work; although an encouraging attempt to expand his range, Hart is especially ill-served muting his live-wire charisma. Preachy and pat, but may push the buttons of more impressionable viewers.37/100",The Upside

Well performed. Moving. Courageous.

We were treated to an Oscar winning performance by Bryan Cranston, who pulled out every stop to achieving a moving account of a man trapped within his own body played against Kevin Hart who was a man trapped in his own downward spiralling life.Mr Cranston's meticulous attention to his craft was faultless, we laughed and cried with him, we lived his indignities and frustrations it was very upsetting and there wasn't a dry eye in the auditorium.The chemistry between the two men was palpable, both needed the other and they adjusted to the naked truth of where they were at in life. Mr Hart gave some of his very best acting and must be recognised for it, he is certainly no one trick pony.Everything was in place, a strong ensemble, tight script, styling, music and great directing. We had some deep insights into the human condition, nothing felt overly contrived and the jokes kept coming.I did not expect this powerful and moving drama from what was predicted to be another formulaic comedy and this was a great and pleasant surprise.The angel dust was certainly sprinkled on this fabulous movie it's a must see.",The Upside

42,rockman182,The Upside (2019),7,13 January 2019,"I've heard of The Intouchables for years but only after I finished watching The Upside did I realize that this film was an American remake of that film. I wanted to see this because I'm a fan of the two leads. Yes I've said it, I like Kevin Hart and feel like his films are often entertaining and has enough comedy in it to make it enjoyable. He does play a similar role in almost all of his films but I'm actually not tired of that shtick yet. Here's another film of 2019 where I'm like screw the haters I had fun with this film.The film (which is based on a true story) is about a rich paraplegic who hires the most under-qualified person to be his caretaker. The man he hires is a former convict on parole who needs to show his officer that he is attempting to find work, who also happens to want to rekindle his relationship with his son. The two begin to bond in the most unlikely of ways and realize the differences in their personalities is what makes them friends.Sure, the film is formulaic and is somewhat predictable but I really enjoyed the pairing of Bryan Cranston and Kevin Hart. The film does what it needs to do; its funny in many parts and has enough drama and heart to push it through its 2+ hour running length. I have nothing to compare it too since I have not seen the French film on which this is based on but I can't pretend to hate it because its too much fun.This is a light hearted dramedy that will entertain you unless you feel the need to compare it to its original source or pick it apart. There's nothing super incredible or profoundly inspiring at work. This is a buddy film of two unlikely characters coming together and its just fine as that. This year is already two for two for me which is kind of unprecedented.7.5/10",The Upside

Many tend to forget that even if their dealing with a child, senior, or disabled, there's still a person inside that doesn't want to feel like a patient.One of the better movies about caretaking was a French film called The Intouchables. This was a lighter movie about race and class difference about two people who are forced into positions that help them become friends, even though circumstance probably wouldn't have them do so in any other moment. It was nothing game changing or masterful, but it was still a nice story that put a smile on my face like how The Green Book did earlier. Its also common that if a foreign film did well, it's likely to get an American adaptation. Let's see if The Upside can generate a similar feeling.Dell Scott (played by Kevin Hart) is a ex con who is trying to find any job so that he can provide for his wife Latrice and his son who wants nothing to do with him. When given a few days to acquire signatures to prove he's looking for work or he'll be sent back to prison, he answers an ad that he thinks is for a janitor job. It turns out that it's actually a caregiver job for a powerful businessman/author Phillip Lacasse (played by Bryan Cranston). Phillip takes a liking to Dell's honesty and hires him, despite having no medical experience.Dell understands that because Phillip is now a quadriplegic, he has to help with everything including eating, lifting, exercising, and driving. Dell proceeds through this as the pay is no only higher then he could imagine, but it also gives him a nice place to stay. While Dell uses his street smarts to treat Phillip like any other guy who needs to loosen up, Phillip influences Dell to try harder at life and to appreciate the finer arts like painting and opera. Both even seem to learn about each others love life as they try to figure out where to proceed.The Upside had to potential to be a lighter comedy if nothing more. I can't see much they can do to improve upon The Intouchables, but a remake can still be entertaining. Unfortunately, this is a project where a lot of the story and comedy don't go well together. This isn't a really bad movie by all means, but I have a hard time trying to figure out who this was made for. It's too sappy for most Kevin Hart fans wanting something really funny or too gross for those wanting an inspiring story.The biggest problem is Kevin Hart. He can be a good comedic talent, but he needs to be attached to the right project in order to take advantage of his style of comedy. I can see him as an over sarcastic schemer, but not as a former thug just getting out of prison. It isn't really his fault, but this was probably an example of a studio putting in a project just because he's popular. I could see a Michael B. Jordan or Chadwick Boseman playing this kind of part better. It was going to be a flaw no matter how hard he tried.Working much better is Bryan Cranston, who seems fine as a wealthy aristocrat whose now facing a new world with his disability. He even manages to have good chemistry with both Kevin Hart and his assistant played by Nicole Kidman. It only makes you wonder why they put all these people in The Upside. Had the movie either slipped into a lighter comedy or just go out all gripping drama, this could have had a more consistent voice, but it seemed that it was afraid to pick one and try to go all over the place tone wise.I'll give this four wheelchairs out of ten. Perhaps there is an audience that won't mind a conflicting tone and want to engage in this story. If people want a better movie, I would point to either The Green Book or The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, if their looking for something about paralysis. Or if you want a better story of this, then watch the original French The Intouchables. I just found this more boring then bad.",The Upside
44,bob-the-movie-man,"Not the 10* French classic, but a fun and moving movie nonetheless.",7,18 January 2019,"So, the movie-going audience for this film will divide into two categories: those that have seen the original 2011 French classic ""The Intouchables"" that this is based on, and those that haven't. ""The Intouchables"" would have got 10* from me, no problem.This movie joins a list of standout European movies - for example, ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo""; ""Let The Right One In""; ""Sleepless Night""; etc. - that have had Hollywood ""makeovers"" that don't match up to the originals. And this is no exception. However, it's still been well made and deserves respect as a standalone piece of movie-making.Based on a true story, Phillip Lacasse (Bryan Cranston) is left both paraplegic and widowed by a string of bad luck. Not that money can buy you everything, but his care arrangements are substantially helped by him being a multi-millionaire (""Not rich enough to buy The Yankees; Rich enough to buy The Mets""). This is from success in investments and writing about such investments.Depressed, cranky and with a ""DNR"" that his diligent PA Yvonne (Nicole Kidman) seems unable to comply with, Phillip lashes out at anyone and everyone and so dispatches his carers with monotonous regularity. Dell Scott (Kevin Hart) is on parole, with the requirement to seek work. Due to a mix-up, he finds himself in the employ of Phillip: with the suspicion that he's been hired because he is the very worst candidate imaginable, and thus the most likely to let Phillip shuffle off this mortal coil. But the two men's antipathy to each other slowly thaws as they teach each other new tricks.Those who have seen ""The Intouchables"" will fondly remember the first 5 minutes of that film: a flash-forward to a manic police car-chase featuring our protagonists (there played by François Cluzet and Omar Sy). It drops like a comedy hand-grenade to open the film. Unfortunately, you can't help but feel a bit let down by the same re-creation in ""The Upside"". It has all the same content but none of the heart.After that rocky start, the film continues to rather stutter along. Part of the reason for this I think is Kevin Hart. It's not that he's particularly bad in the role: it's just that he IS Kevin Hart, and I was constantly thinking ""there's that comedian playing that role"".However, once the story gets into its swing, giving Cranston more of a chance to shine (which he does), then the film started to motor and my reservations about Hart started to wane. Some of these story set pieces - such as the one about the art work - are punch-the-air funny in their own right. Cranston's timing in delivering his punchlines is immaculate.There seems to have been some furore about the casting of Bryan Cranston as the role of the disabled millionaire instead of a disabled actor. Lord save us! He's an actor! That's what actors do for a living: pretend to be people they're not! It's also worth pointing out that François Cluzet was an able-bodied actor as well.As already mentioned, Bryan Cranston excels in the role. Phillip goes through such a wide range of emotions from despair to pure joy and back again that you can't help but be impressed by the performance.On the female side of the cast, it's really nice to see Nicole Kidman in such a quiet and understated role and it's nicely done; Aja Naomi King does a nice job as Dell's protective ex-girlfriend Latrice; and there's a nice female cameo as well, which I won't spoil since I wasn't expecting to see her in the film.As a standalone film it has some laugh-out-loud moments, some feelgood highs and some moments of real pathos. The audience I saw this with was small, but there was still a buzz in the room and sporadic applause as the end titles came up: God only knows that's unusual for a film! The director is ""Limitless"" and ""Divergent"" director Neil Burger, and it's a perfectly fun and innocent night out at the flicks that I commend to the house in this month of celluloid awards heavyweights.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook.

45,esteban1747,A billionaire and a miserable,8,7 February 2020,"A very successful remake of a comedy-drama, directed by Neil Burger, which deals with the life of two beings with different stories. One with culture and a lot of money, another uneducated and without money, but with a lot of ingenuity to make live a fantasy world hitherto unknown by the billionaire. What one lacks is left over to the other, so the life of one is complemented with that of the other. The idiocy of the rich class is evident at times, a very positive aspect of this film. There are many who boast knowing and are true ignorant. What you have as a soul is many times richer in those beings that lack wealth, at least they are better able to understand the needs of persons next to them. Good acting by Bryan Cranston, and a magnificent one by Kevin Hart, who really stole the show.",The Upside
46,brankovranjkovic,The Upside - Remake of Intouchables,8,18 January 2019,"An uplifting comedy drama about friendship and trust.Based on a true story between a quadriplegic billionaire (Cranston) and his street wise, ex-con, live in caretaker (Hart). Hart's intension was to secure any kind of employment and hopefully reconnect with his estranged son and ex-wife.They meet by accident when Hart applies for a janitor's job but secures a caretaking role instead. They form an unlikely friendship even though they seem to have nothing in common. Hart offers a fresh perspective on living life, he competently delivers an unusual straight role with some of his usual humour.I saw the original when Cineworld was offering a buy one get one free deal, so I booked two tickets and gave away two tickets to my son and his best mate, not knowing we were about to see a subtitled foreign film... Anyway I gave the kids the option to bail out if they wanted, but it was one of the highlight films of the year, we all enjoyed very much.Upside is also a very good character driven film (maybe not as good as the original) but what they both do is clearly illustrate what friendship can really mean.",The Upside

The Upside was heartwarming, funny and inspiring while also respecting the legacy of the original - a personal favourite of mine.Cranston and Hart had really good chemistry and worked well off eachother, which was really vital for the success of this. It's basically impossible for Bryan Cranston to deliver a poor performance anyway. He was phenomenal in the role of Phillip.It took me a little while to get into at first. Once it found its rhythm, things became a lot more enjoyable. Nicole Kidman was perfectly cast in her role as uptight Yvonne.

49,statuskuo,MSM Can't Shake Their Bias,7,27 January 2019,"Having read a few of the media's reviews, I am stunned at the mindless writings of people who are suppose to be professionals. Perhaps they're influenced by the events of Kevin Hart's statements...from a decade ago...overall..had they wanted this to be a contender for awards...they wouldn't have to try so hard to conjure up things to hate about this movie.
To dispel some of the poor reviews...one mentioned why Phil (Bryan Cranston) would hire someone so unqualified. Had they been paying attention, you discover that he was hired BECAUSE he was unqualified. He put into place a decision to not resuscitate because he was miserable being a quadrapalegic. Another thing I read...how did the blind letter writer not know he was quadrapalegic? She did. She, in fact said repeatedly she searched him on Google. Unreal.
Lastly, the fact that a job drops into his lap at the moment he desperately needed one and by total serendipidous mistake he shows up for the job. Nope. He mistakenly walks into a job wanting to just get a signature for his parole officer.
It astonishes me critics...and I mean paid critics overlooked...the charm of the movie despite its minor logic flaws. Odd only that the same critics championed the idiotic ""Halloween"" (2018). Lost is Bryan Cranston and Kevin Hart's wonderful banter. It must be nails on a chalkboard to cynica who have to have empowered angry minority women drive the story. Or some laughable Bechtdel test to satisfy the anti-male bonding flicks.

Entertaining and touching, and not nearly as cornball as similar movies have been. No idea how closely this resembles the true story it is based on, so perhaps that is where some will find fault - though other movies based on true stories that take a lot of liberties have rated well. I often find myself fighting through a period of dozing at many films, but had no such problem with this one. Hart and Cranston are excellent, as is Kidman and the other supporting cast members. It's not a laugh-a-minute type of movie, but where it does go for laughs, it generally hits, and where it goes for heart, it hits there as well. I suspect some of the ratings here were impacted by the recent controversy surrounding Hart. Sad, because this deserves far better than its 5.3 rating (as of now).

Every cliche from Dangerous Minds (1995) up to all recent terrible movies is here. Black man is a bad father, white man is painted as comically privileged even if completely immobile, forced drama, forced sadness, inconsistently written characters and lack of a payoff.

I've seen better character conflicts written in Shrek 1.Waste of good actors on unoriginal trash Oscar bait.

58,thebricks,"Decent movie, but so much like The Favourite that it couldn't have been a coincidence",7,13 January 2019,"Pretty good movie overall, decent jokes, plot was down to Earth, but having just watched The Favourite, I noticed a lot of similarities that were impossible to ignore. Certain plot elements, facial mannerisms, laughter and shots were incredibly similar. This was what I noticed.1. Dell is poor, homeless but destitute until finding employment with Phillip, and incredibly wealthy quadraplegic. Abigail Masham in The Favourite is down and out and poor until she is employed by the Queen of England, who suffers with gout and feet problems.
2. Dell makes a disastrous first impression with an associate of his employer much like Abigail has with Lady Sarah.
3. Phillip's business associate and neighbor conspire to get rid of Dell because he's gotten too chummy with him, much like Lady Sarah tries to get rid of Abigail after she gets too close to the Queen.
4. Much of the movie takes place in Phillip's bedroom where Dell attends to him, not unlike how Abigail Masham spends much of the movie in the Queen's chambers attending to her like a caretaker.
5. Phillip provides Dell with an opportunity to improve his station in life with a large amount of money and presumably the managerial/engineering job he magically gets later(where did he get the training to get this job? Was a scene cut from the movie explaining this?). The Queen offers Abigail Masham a chance to join the nobility by marrying an officer.
6. Certain scenes are shot the same way, even snorts of laughter, are lifted wholesale from The Favourite. The way Kevin Hart sits in the bedroom at one point is exactly like how Masham sits attending to the Queen and when Dell first meets Phillip and gets the job, he has a rude awakening getting cleaned up in the fancy shower much like Abigail does after getting the job in the bath. Dell plops down on his bed in his fancy new room just like Abigail Masham does after getting promoted out of the Scullery.
7. Dell gains favor with Phillip using women much like Abigail gains favor with the Queen by appealing to her sexually.
8. Dell helps Phillip enjoy life again much like Abigail helps the Queen do the same.
9. Dell is preferred to everyone else in Phillip's social and professional circle because he is honest and down to Earth, which is why the Queen also preferred Abigail Masham to Lady Sarah.I know some people might disagree with me, but there was too much I couldn't ignore about the similarities of this movie to The Favourite. It was uncanny and undeniable at times. It still was a good movie, but yet another Hollywood movie that coincidentally shares so much in common with another movie released around the same time that it's clear someone was inspired by someone else's script.",The Upside

Which means they are not trying to portray the real people or do a version of the characters in the original film. It also makes it very honest performances.The negative is that it lacks something in terms of being true.

Whilst nothing overly dramatic occurs, the plot moves on swiftly and we get to see the characters develop. Most importantly, it is genuinely funny, and nothing is too sensitive to make a joke of, it's real.You could argue that an actor with a disability could have played the role, but who can name such an actor who could draw the same audience as Cranston?

Dell is a small time criminal looking for a job and who is also out on Parole.This pairing will take some work, okay a lot of work, but, in time things, work out and each learns to have respect for each other.There is a lot of careful stepping around broken glass by Phillip and Dell and a lot of the banter is honest and funny at times. We see a little of the care Dell has to do, but when it came to the catheter replacement, I had to use the fast forward button. Too much time was spent on these scenes and they were not as funny as the director thought they would be.Dell tries to set Phillip up with a woman who Phillip had been writing to and Dell wants them to meet as they never have.There are similarities to the movie GREEN BOOK with the banter between Phillip and Dell re music and food to be sure.Again, Nicole Kidman surprised me with her look. I almost didn't recognize her. She is a genius at doing that to me. (You think she does it on purpose?) Kidman played Yvonne ,Phillip's Executive Assistant and she did a good job as usual.The acting all around is first rate. There is something that happened when Dell was fired by Phillip, we see Dell in a factory setting that looked very much like mechanical wheel chairs were being assembled, but nothing was ever said how Dell got that job or anything about it. Something was missed here. Remember this is a true story and that was left out?

I am aware that there will always be remakes but I really don't see the use for these kind of remakes. Why take a perfectly good French movie and a couple of years later do an English translation? Nobody will think this is better than the original or that it was a very good idea to make it. And to have people like Bryan Cranston, Nicole Kidman or Neil Burger get attached to it just makes me lose a bit of artistic respect for them. Which brings me to Kevin Hart and the reason I didn't like this film at all. Omar Sy was such a perfect choice for that role because he brings this wide eyed optimism that is very necessary for that role as he always seemed to be trying his best.

81,RhapsodyReviews,Ending Gets Away From It.,8,24 November 2019,"Review:
'The Upside' is a comedy-drama film directed by Neil Burger. It is a remake of the French film 'The Intouchables', which was itself inspired by the life of Philippe Pozzo di Borgo.
Admititly I was a little concerned going into this movie. Afterall Kevin Hart has been known to be a little one note, and Bryan Cranston as amazing as he is can only do so much being in a car for the entire runtime. Yet, this is yet another surprise that had me both laughing in stitches and brought tears to my eyes.
The film follows a paralyzed billionaire (Bryan Cranston) who strikes up an unlikely friendship with a recently paroled convict (Kevin Hart) whom he hires to take care of him.
First things first, we al know how amazing Bryan Cranston is in everything he does, but Kevin Hart was amazing in this movie. He shows a comedic side of course, but he also gets to show his dramatic side and he does a brilliant job. Nicole Kidman isn't in the film a lot, but she was pretty good in the role she was given.
The fact that this movie is based on a true story is incredible. I'm not sure of the accuracy, but I do know it's main focus is true. Where the movie falls short is in the ending. It wants to wrap up quick but loses out on so much story to tell.
Overall, it is a very entertaining movie all around. It has great performances, but the ending gets away from it and could have been stretch out.

83,hunter-friesen,Hart and Cranston can't save unoriginal schlock,6,29 January 2019,"In the film industry, January is usually the month that big studios dump films that they have lost confidence in. A large majority of these films come and go without anyone noticing they even exist. One of the biggest films of this January is ""The Upside"", which tells the unlikely true story of a wealthy quadriplegic hiring an ex-con to be his caregiver. Starring Bryan Cranston and Kevin Hart, this film isn't as bad as its release date would suggest, but it also isn't anything special enough to justify your attention or hard earned money.Directed by Hollywood workman Neil Burger, ""The Upside"" is both structured and shot in the typical fashion that one would come to expect from studio comedies. Everything feels like it was assembled from a template and has been done dozens of times before by more competent directors.Burger middlingly works with the more emotional aspects of the film as any moment of dramatic tension can be seen coming from miles away and follows the usual cues of the genre. Even the tonal shifts become quite predictable and create an endless cycle of half-hearted storytelling.While it may have been unintentional, the one thing that Burger does well at is letting the actors do what they do best. Hart and Cranston take over every scene they appear together in and use their chemistry to distract from many of the film's faults.Being as this is a remake of the 2011 French film ""The Intouchables"", the story very much follows closely with the source material.The biggest thing that the script lacks compared to the original is a sense of emotional weight between the main characters.This problem mainly stems from a thin plot with lofty intentions that only offers tepid results. The writers try to tackle the racial and economic divide between the main characters but end up putting in so little effort that it feels disjointed and a waste of time. Insightful commentary is tossed aside for one-liners and sly remarks that end up feeling overly safe and tedious.Despite being over two hours long, the film continually runs into the problem of having too little to work with, especially from the two weak subplots; one being Hart trying to reconnect with his son and the other with Cranston battling his limitations to find love. Both the side stories felt quite empty and gave each actor little to work with. This resulted in a muddied overall narrative that fought and tore itself down rather than building to something meaningful.Probably the biggest saving grace for the film (and the only reason anyone would watch it) is the performances from the two leading actors.Kevin Hart does what he does best as Dell and shows that he is still a master of comedy, whether it be physical or through his fast-paced banter. Even though the script is mostly to blame, Hart does struggle with the dramatic parts that require him to slow down and break away from his usual tricks.Acting as the dry humor to Hart's energy is Bryan Cranston as the extremely wealthy and depressed quadriplegic, Phillip. While he does serve up some funny remarks from time to time, Cranston more or less just goes through the motions and knows that he is above a project of this quality.Lastly, Nicole Kidman intermittently shows up as Phillip's executive assistant, Yvonne. Kidman really feels out of place as her skills go unused on a character whose only purpose is to be a disapproving foil to Hart's shenanigans.Except for Kevin Hart or Bryan Cranston, there really isn't much in this film to make things interesting. There are some comedic elements that incite some chuckles, but more times than not a feeling of emptiness will lay dormant in your head. Best described as a filler movie to waste some time, ""The Upside"" is something you'll watch and most likely forget about twenty-four hours later.",The Upside

There were also a couple plot holes. They just skipped too much. The story was great though. There were some really great scenes in this movie that deserve to be better but it was just the stupid scenes that nailed back down. The acting I thought was great too.

91,rmarkd,heartwarming and uplifting. loved this movie.,9,2 July 2020,"The Upside is a movie about uber rich business turnaround specialist Philip Lacasse (Bryan cranston). Lacasse suffered an injury and is quadreplegic. He and assistant Yvonne Pendleton (Nicole Kidman) decide to hire a life auxillary to help assist Lacasse. Parolee Dell Scott (Kevin Hart) accidentally finds himself applying for the job and Lacasse, seeing Scott as a breath of fresh air from the other applicants decides to take a risk on Scott, much to the chagrin of Pendleton.Surprisingly (or not, as this is a Hollywood movie) upper class Lacasse and lower class Scott end up forming a close bond. Lacasse gets a spark of life from Scott as he sees Lascasse as not just some cripple needing to be cared for until he dies. Scott sees Lacasse initially as a way to make some good money and support his estranged son and son's mother, but also ends up seeing Lacasse as a geniune person and someone he wants to actually help. That wanting to help ended up bleeding to his relationship with son and baby-mama.It's a heartwarming and uplifting movie, that yeah, is the kind of movie that Hollywood loves to tell, but to their credit, they don't beat you over the head with it. Lacasse is white, Scott is black, but they don't make it a ""black guy is there becuase of racist white society."" Scott made bad choices, he owns up to it, and sees this as an opportunity to turn thing around.Cranston is, of course, great in the role. Hart plays the comedic role, but also with a touch of drama, sympathy, and heart. His normal ""over the top"" acting is subdued and we get just enough of it to be believable and funny, but not grating. The two play really well off each other and, while the movie was just over 2 hours long, I didn't feel any drag. Indeed, when it ended, I wanted it to go a bit further. It probably didn't need to, but I just really enjoyed seeing them together.Looks like this is a remake and some of the reviews I think are lower because they think this is a cheap copy of the original.

As soon as I saw the announcement of the American remake my pessimistic side started banging the bell and screaming outrageous words. One might wonder whether negative thoughts have that much power?Right away I got tricked into believing that the film will be almost shot-by-shot remake with smaller Kevin Hart and badly broken Bryan Cranston, although following half an hour I got even more disappointed with darker tones of a backstory and attempts to introduce toilet humor to dilute the grim atmosphere.At some point I was ready to stop and call it a day but started to notice some differences and the duo became livelier. I was surprised with the completely different approach that is actually harder to watch but seems hugging the reality like they are best friends that gives a chance of something unexpected.Although it is based on the true story, I have never followed it and don't know what is real and what is fiction. The moments that repeat the original might be, however, the novelties give a new kick and intrigue you. Of course, the morale still circles around the second chance and unexpected friendship but this is one of the appealing sides of the story.Still inspired by the events I would like to say that the new interpretation of the magnificent tale could not beat the initial masterpiece but it also didn't fulfil the utterly negative prophecy of my gut. I can firmly recommend watching it at least once, especially if you have seen the original.",The Upside

96,GavWaskett,Kevin Hart can act!,8,14 August 2020,"I need to say this to start with - Kevin Hart can act, I mean he can really act. He isn't just a comedy driven whirlwind playing vaguely annoying characters, he is a very good actor when he wants to be as well as a being good at comedy, which he has already proven (See Jumanji/Central Intelligence).The film is based on a French film - The Intouchables, which in itself is based on the true life story of French businessman Philippe Pozzo di Borgo. Bryan Cranston is Phillip, a paralysed billionaire who employs Kevin Hart's ex-con and grossly unqualified Dell as his care giver or 'Life Auxiliary' (there's some really daft job titles out there!). He employs him because he gives him a bit of lip and doesn't give a toss that he is paralysed. Nicole Kidman is Yvonne, Phillips assistant who just wants the best for him and as a good assistant is not entirely convinced that Dell is the way forward.There is the usual Hollywood tosh about Dell's estranged wife and child who he has let down one too many times, but see past this nonsense to the real crux of the film, the relationships between Phillip and Dell and Yvonne and you have a marvellously written and superbly acted drama with touches of light comedy that don't come across as patronising(Shell thoughts on the matter) but add to the believable relationships.Kevin Hart is superb as Dell, he can verge on the manic but generally hits the right balance. Nicole Kidman is very understated as Yvonne, which is what the character needed, and it was great to see such a Hollywood powerhouse not trying to overtake the film. Finally, Bryan Cranston portrays Phillip amazingly well, for an able-bodied actor to pull off a character who can only move their neck must be so difficult, but he tells the story through his facial expressions brilliantly.And huge well done to Neil Burger, the director who treated a difficult subject with such a gentle touch and Jon Hartmere, who adapted the screen play.The film is on Amazon Prime and I am disappointed that it did not get more press at the time, though reading up on it, it did pretty well at the box office - so yay to the cinema going public that are not me!Watch it, watch it, watch it.",The Upside

I was wrong.
Not sure how this flew under the radar so quietly, when you have Bryan Cranston playing the disabled role, and Kevin Hart performing more drama than comedy, whilst also having Nicole Kidman in the mix. Two out of those three people rarely ever commit to a project unless the script is way above average.
Now, it's not as superb as the original French version, which is to be expected, but it's pretty decent. It even made me laugh out loud.
And they also took the liberty of changing some parts of the story a little, and rightfully so, as the story should reflect the characters, environment and country it is based around in.Hart and Cranston demonstrate some great chemistry, and honestly, Hart should be demanding more serious roles.Overall, a perfect example of a feel-good movie that isn't a romcom.",The Upside

116,actaction,"Almost perfect, but falters near ending",7,19 August 2021,"The film has a lot of perfect moments, simple things that raise it above what it could have been. Cranston is the amazing performer he always is, with a sweetness and a smile that feels so genuine. Hart plays off of Cranston well & carries his own in a surprisingly strong dramatic role. The film let Hart be Hart, which in terms of judging performance sometimes can be considered crutch. It shouldn't be more Hart than the character he is playing. Cranston, alternatively, is never not in his characters moment, choosing to ignore his comedy chops and giving a far more muted and trusting performance. The film has a forward momentum, but near the end seems to not be sure how to completely wrap it up. The major flaw is when Cranston's character professes to miss Kidman's character, which is a need the film never established for either of them, but for which the emotional ending hinges on. It's not something that can be hinted at, as we know she left her husband to be near him, but there isn't enough moments to know that she cares about him (or him her) more than an appreciation. If they are in some kind of deep love, we don't know it and the entire scene falls flat. Had the film taken a moment to have Cranston say ""she is the love of my life"" or something then her coming back would mean more. We don't even see her leave, which was a major moment missed and is taken for granted that we will accept that she would leave without knowing the moment that made it happen.All that said, the film is charming, funny and uplifting... not always something easy for filmmakers to do and for which many films don't seem interested. It's mega success, while partly due to Hart's moment of popularity & Cranston's occasional ability to bring his fans out, is more about selling the positivity of the story and convincing audiences to come out despite its not being a franchise. These mid-budget films which used to be staple of Hollywood are often forgotten or shelved, but can lead to great artistic and monetary reward for the filmmakers brave and talented enough to make them, market them & sell them.",The Upside

122,thirtyfivestories,Kevin Hart Reprises His Get Hard Character Without Permission,4,29 January 2019,"Welcome to the latest American sullying of a beloved foreign film. The 2011 blockbuster French The Intouchables currently stands as #40 on IMDb's Top Rated Movies, and is the original film that inspired this Americanized knock-off. Truth be told, the casting of Kevin Hart very nearly works, however, either Neil Burger's lack of a backbone or taste allows Hart to ad lib his brand of squeaky hyperbolic comedy to invade otherwise convincing dramatic performance. After Hart's fourth mispronounced word (because his character's lack of education is apparently a punch-line), my patience officially evaporated.Hart plays an ex-con (this is merely a guess for the film doesn't care to provide his background) on probation named Dell. He has to complete employment papers that send him all over NYC to various employers who he only views as signatures and not viable restarts. This job scavenger hunt leads him to billionaire Phillip Lacasse (Bryan Cranston) who is shopping for a new ""life auxiliary"". After waiting a reasonable amount of time in Phillip's penthouse foyer, Dell bursts in on an interview ahead of his, and insists on grabbing the boss man's signature and getting out of this place he certainly doesn't belong in. Phillip, however, has other ideas.A quadriplegic bound to a motorized chair, Phillip is wealthy enough to buy the Mets, but appears completely empty inside. When Dell barges in, Phillip sees a shinning opportunity. He is dead set on finding an care-giver that doesn't adore him out of fear that his ""do not resuscitate"" wishes will be unmet. As Dell will say later, ""I will DNR your ass right now,"" making him the ideal and wholly unqualified candidate. After a verbal tussle, Phillip plants the idea of Dell working for him much to the chagrin of his personal assistant Yvonne, played curiously by Nicole Kidman. This casting choice elevates the film while simultaneously detracting from it. Kidman, an Australian actress, fluctuates from different accents, which is shocking considering her brilliant history of nailing American intonation, which would've suited this role arguably better.The cultural exchange between the two men is the epicenter of the feel-goodness that the film's marketing has rode into the ground. Hart's only slightly believable criminal character uses rudeness and insensitivity to sell his background which only leads to an intolerable caricature lacking almost all nuance. Cranston performs with only everything north of his neck, and proves to convey a delightful sense of adventure when faced with Hart's theatrics. Their chemistry does produce a respectable amount of chuckles and smiles, but never long enough to make you forget that Hart is desperately trying to hijack each moment.Dell brings weed to the relationship, Phillip brings opera. The symbiotic nature of their friendship highlights how ridiculous each has lived without the other. The more ambitious (if not perfectly executed) scenes has Dell selectively smashing Phillip's heirlooms upon his request after the paralyzed man's anger demands a physical, explosive catharsis. These are the moments where cracks appear in the film making but also where the story almost rises above the comedic shackles of the otherwise charming comedian turned actor.I must admit to laughing my ass off at two moments in particular, but these sequences stole the show in inappropriate manners, and left it challenging to remember the film as a whole, effectively eclipsing the larger narrative. One of the rare instances of laughs being a negative attribute, but I cannot deny the joy that comes with the frustration. An overall hollow, star-carried remake; Hollywood rapes yet another intellectual property.",The Upside

I suppose greed is what's responsible for Hollywood making movies that don't need to be made. As well as the reason Dell had to make a racial issue out of everything in the beginning. If you've seen the original, the Senegal caregiver Driss didn't find it necessary to make everything a racial issue. More importantly, since the real life caregiver was actually a middle eastern man. I suppose Hollywood needed to make Kevin racist to give him street cred, to make him edgy, right?

I put a ten star rating because, although I think it is a 7 out of 10 film, I'm trying to balance the score out because there are some real idiots on this site marking a film 1 out of 10 before it is even released, just because it happens to be a remake of a French film I've never heard of. People like this ruin the site and almost had me put off from watching this film due to the low score (at the time I went to see the film it was 4.9).The performances from Hart and Cranston were great with Hart really holding his own against Cranston who is always a great actor. The storyline (remake or not) was enjoyable and the humour worked well and had me chuckling out loud a few times... and had me wincing too.... The men will understand...Sure this is a predictable feel-good film and doesn't bring anything new to the table but so what? Sometimes it is nice just to go to the cinema and enjoy the ride for a couple of hours. Not everything has to be overly long or complicated... And speaking of length... That is one negative about the film. For me it could have had a little shaved off as the running time is fairly lengthy but, even so...

I THINK NOT!,9,6 May 2021,"I watched this movie on Netflix late at night when I couldn't sleep (I had never heard of it, but took a chance) and laughed so many times, it was a huge delight. The biggest criticism by movie reviews seems to be that it is cliche, predictable and unoriginal (and, of course, a remake of a better film) but I found almost none of that - I did give a 9 rating only because of the oft used black-white dynamic, though it works well here as it did in earlier classics such as Trading Places (1983). On that note, why not have a rich black guy in the wheelchair and a hip, young white street person taking care of him as they become friends? That WOULD be original, and much less stereotypical. But this is a delight throughout, even the one character who actually is cliche, but played well by the always lovely Nicole Kidman. The rest of the cast performs very well also, and the movie looks great.I caught this on a whim, but you should plan a date night around it as it is very heartfelt entertainment for couples as well as all age groups. It's even a Man Cave movie for guys. Cranston has proven post-Breaking Bad to be the most consistently delivering actor in a wide variety of roles, and it is hard to beat Kevin Hart for fun and humor. Enjoy!",The Upside

147,cinemawithcj,The Upside - Cinema with CJ Review,6,26 January 2019,"The Upside is a remake of a French film I've been meaning to see, that's also based on a true story. It's also known for a bit of casting controversy, having able-bodied Bryan Cranston play a quadriplegic billionaire, but without broaching that discussion handled much better than people more informed than I, I'll continue to just look at the face value of this movie.Which, overall, is pretty average and fine. The Upside never reaches the bounds of greatness or attaining any sense of importance or resonance, but it sure tries and thinks it has.Director Neil Burger has a great name and a string of average films, and this is no different. Funnily enough, those films are also memorable in concept but not context, where The Upside is more of the same.It's to no fault of the performances. Kevin Hart certainly tries to go beyond his comedy, but it's the stuff he's good at that's his strength here. His story is very by the numbers how you would expect it to be.Cranston continues to show that he has a brilliant range, wonderfully being comedic and dramatic when he has to.The issue with The Upside though is that...it's not anything remarkable. Some ideas feel hollow or on the nose. I wouldn't hand-wave it all as just cliche, but it does feel too familiar and as expected when you consider the situation we're given.It's strongest with its leads. Cranston and Hart have some fantastic chemistry, which seems to be a testament to Hart. He may not have the best filmography, but his chemistry with his leads usually turns out to be the closest thing to a saving grace each and every time.All the moments of real gravitas feel like flat attempts at creating so. For every by the book moment between ex-con Hart and his family, or Cranston trying to date, or Hart discovering opera, there's nothing powerful or worthwhile.Its key scenes are the light hearted ones, even if they too are predictable. There's a scene where Hart needs to replace Cranston's catheter, and if you try to picture how you think that scene plays out, it's exactly that way, even down to Hart's expressions and mannerisms.The Upside just feels like it has a solid idea and mission as a movie, but just feels phoned in and underdeveloped. The screenplay is full of smart hooks, but it's flanked by indistinguishable time skips and character moments that come out of nowhere or aren't developed enough. We have Nicole Kidman, for example, and she's never quite fully explained, yet by the end of it all she's promoted to sudden love interest status.The film just feels like a half-baked draft. We have the perfect duo for the film for better or worse, but the rest of the film feels like a placeholder for a much better film. It's charming and funny, but it never moves beyond the average. Even the cinematography and the editing feels a little unrefined. Starting in media res, The Upside (and it's trailers) certainly spoil the journey and the arc of our characters before you even get stuck into the story. It would be more ideal if you haven't seen any marketing, but that seems like an impossible task.The downside to this experience, other than the obvious issues with casting, is that while the acting is on point and it's good to see Hart try to diversify his roles a teeeeeny tiny bit, two good performances does not a good film make. It needs more.The Upside is that...at least it's not offensive and it's not entirely tone deaf...even if we're talking rich white people who need help and poor black ex-cons trying to turn over a new leaf and make things better for their family...Oh, wait, I see it now.CJ",The Upside

There is so much emotion, real feelings. Kevin Hart in a serious, poignant role, yet still funny. His best role yet and revealed another side of himself. HE IS GREAT! Bryan Cranston's greatest acting was absolutely not moving his arms or hands at all throughout. I'm sure this took amazing concentration as it is a reflex to move ones hands without even thinking. Nicole Kidman very good, haven't seen her in a while and was surprised. Audience laughed at all the right moments. You could feel everyone was really into the movie. I also shed tears, you will too.

This was the best movie we have seen all year (several years in fact), and Neil Burger should be applauded for his direction on this film.
I am not a fan of Kevin Hart (often filthy-mouthed), but he has truly out-done himself on this film. Bryan Cranston has shown he is a veteran actor with a true artisan gift in acting with this film.
Along with it being one of the cleanest films out of Hollywood in a VERY LONG time, this is a must see movie for friends and family.
Although some issues/scenes (the catheter) was a bit too personal, it was something handled very well and very funny. For those who have to assist paraplegics I have the greatest respect.

So much diluted and ruined from the original masterpiece - witty dialogue, awesome soundtrack and character development- particularly that between the two leads.

Being both the sole caregiver to my mom, bedridden at home as she slowly passed from Cancer and now being mostly bedridden myself. Thankfully I'm no longer wearing diapers as it is something horrific for a 30 year old to go through (though I always had fun being cheeky with male nurses when they cleaned and changed me lmao!) especially since I was so strongly independent, now relying on strangers to be my caregivers (no family at all).Please, give this film an honest try. I can tell you after living life at both ends of the spectrum that this is as real as it gets (though a caregiver like Hart portrays are truly VERY rare) and if you can watch this with an open mind and heart you may just find yourself thinking about what it is like to live either life.I gave this film a 10* rating in hopes to help boost its star rating but it is a very soldi 8.5* and deserves a look. I realise this is a remake of a lovely French film and that many reviewers are jaded because 'it's not as good as the original' but remakes never are and though I never saw the original film I believe if you go into watching this with an open mind and heart, not expecting the 'original' you will enjoy it too.Have a beautifully amazing day!!

In it a young black man is hired to take care of a rich, white paralyzed man in a wheelchair and ultimately inspires the white man with his joie de vivre making for a delightful film. Watch that wonderful film, yes even with subtitles it's wonderful.
Hollywood seems to have a hard time coming up with original ideas, but for some reason the French and British do not. I think it has more to do with the executives in the big movie industry reluctant to take a chance (how often have you heard of a blockbuster film being turned down before it was finally made because the money men were afraid to take a chance?)

I thought that this would be a good movie to watch, this is amazing movie to watch. This is Kevin Hart best role. He wasn't the dumb, one-liner comic. He'd actually acted. Yes his comedy was good, but it fit perfectly with this role. Bryan Cranston was great. Nicole Kidman was a added treat. Loved the happy ending. The storyline was great. 3 different type of actors that worked great together. The music was so beautifully done. From opera to Aretha Franklin. You couldn't ask for better. The cast of characters are great, except Tate Donovan's character, he was dull. Overall this was a wonderful movie to watch. Watch this with your family. They will enjoy it.

The camera jumps for every line in 1-2 seconds rather than waiting for at least 5-10.3) Awful music. Either none or awful compared to Ludovico Einaudi.4) Horrible acting. Especially by kevin heart, he was like a sculpture reading his lines. And I even questioned Bryan Cranston, his laugh resembles rather a fart from his mouth, and someone should have explained him that his character has paralysis BELOW the neck, his FACE is NOT PARALIZED. I even started to question his role in Breaking Bad, I started to imagine if the french guy knew english and played Walter White instead, if would he be better.

216,fire-child,Not a classic - but not a tragedy either,6,17 August 2019,"If this was an original film, rather than the remake of the French film Intouchables, probably it would have got better press than it has.How you react to this film is probably going to be influenced whether you've seen that film or not, and whether you thought it was a classic or not. I enjoyed Intouchables a lot, although I respected that some people may have thought it was brushing with sickly and sentimentalist at times. The same issues apply here - so if you disliked these in the original film, you'll to some degree dislike it here too. If you enjoyed it in the original, you'll probably enjoy it here too again.Although sticking fairly close to the original's story, it's not at least a shot for shot remake, and deviates in some curious areas as well. The new narrative sadly though isn't as strong all round, and the acting and characters aren't altogether as compelling either (particularly since Kevin Hart, as good a turn as he puts in here, just can't replace the unforgettable Omar Sy). I found it too a little bit more cliched than the original, which had its cliches to start with.Still, it's a decent way of spending a few hours. Hart is very watchable - his chemistry with his on screen son I found a highlight, and with Bryan Cranston. Nicole Kidman,in the most restrained performance you'll ever see from her, is also worth a look - if for no other reason than to see she can play here very against her screen types in the past.",The Upside

However, this is the first Kevin Hart movie where I can say I left the theatre VERY pleased, and saying ""this is actually a great movie"". Kevin Hart plays his most serious role yet but adds comedic relief at points, but it works because the movie isn't ocersaturated with comedy. Brian Cranston plays a phenomenal role and you actually really start to connect with and feel for Phillip. Nicole Kidman also has a great performance in this film. Anyone saying that this movie is bad just because it's a remake of a 2011 film are just stubborn and don't want to like this movie heading into it.

In my opinion this is one of his best performances to date and every scene he is in is amazing. The best thing about this movie is the relationship Kevin Hart and Bryan Cranston have on screen.
I do not understand the bad ratings for this film. I understand that there was another movie made about this story a few years ago.

Well, I decided to actually watch this movie and what I found was an amazing remake. The way this story was told and presented was an enjoyable moment. Kevin Hart and Bryan Cranston were the perfect pair together. The way they were able to play off of each other and the way Kevin Hart was able to bring a bit of comedy in the right moments to a serious true story was nothing short of pure perfection and professionalism. I highly recommend this movie, along with the original French with English Subtitles ""The Intouchables"" as well (nominated for a Golden Globe in 2013, and nominated and winner of many, many awards around the world). Both are worthy of your time. I was a Kevin Hart fan before this movie, but have now elevated him to a favorite ""serious"" actor as well because of his performance in this movie.

Even with that said he still is very funny in this movie but in a different way than what I am used to. Bryan Cranston once again has not let me down. I believe this movie was well written and It was a nice way to spend a couple hours just chilling and watching while eating some BBQ. I watch alot of movies and I dont always write reviews but this movie really left me feeling pretty good by the time the credits started rolling. And that is what I was going for and what I needed.

238,pandora1988,Every Bad Review is from lovers of the original,8,19 January 2019,I guess this true story is a remake of a French film. It is a great story full of laughs and emotion. It's about finding one's place and developing friendships. Every single bad review complains the original was better. It almost seems as if the creators of the original had all their friends and fans come write bad reviews whatever they saw this one or not. This is a very enjoyable film. Don't believe the bad reviews!,The Upside
239,andyfindlay,Better than critics say but not by much!,6,22 January 2019,"The true story is undeniable a beautiful one, The Upside certainly aims to recreate that, but suffocates itself under poorly timed comedy and a miscast lead.As full of warmth as this movie is, any successful convey of emotions repetitively become undermined by comedic moments that feel unnecessary and out of place. Even though many laughs are worthy, tragically misplaced gags and at times close to offensive gags do not sit well with the tone of the film.Of the two leads, Cranston continuously outshines, steals scenes and leaves his co-star behind. That co-star is of course, Kevin Hart, at times he felt well suited to the role, especially in the first scenes, but as the movie proceeds the feeling he was miscast continuously creeps up and imposes on the film greatly.No chemistry between the leads was established and was abundantly clear Hart and Cranston were staring in two different movies. All supporting roles are well executed with Kidman leaving the lasting impression and outstars the entire cast.The story was however, well paced but structural wise felt out of order. The first 10 minutes were abundantly out of place and ruined any impact of future scenes which contradicts what happened in the opening (this ruined severity of many scenes which defied it).",The Upside

Hollywood is a $hit hole of filth and ugliness. this movie is a pleasant surprise for sure. I will watch this again. It was great to see how sometimes the least qualified is still the best one for the job and how people can come back from depression, get over rejection, find joy in life even after losing so much. it was just great!

This screenplay not only has funny situations, it has laugh-out-loud funny lines--and the matinee audience with whom I saw it was bellowing with laughter. Bryan Cranston and Kevin Hart nail it, with admirable support from Nicole Kidman and Julianna Margulies.The bad reviews are mostly the reviewers revealing their insecurity about all things American when compared with the French. This reverse snobbery is unbecoming and even embarrassing.By the way, do you think any of the people who voted 1-star on the first day of its release actually saw the film? I don't.

I saw that film a few years ago and I loved it. But this one is still pretty good.I have a problem with Hollywood remakes most of the time. They take great foreign films and remake them for no good reason, inevitably making them worse. The original is great so why remake it?But this is an exception. While it's still not as good as the original it is worth a watch. The story takes a few different turns while still being faithful to its source material. And while I don't think it needed to be remade, I guess maybe its good if only for those who don't like to read subtitles in foreign films, although I still think all those people are missing out on some great films.",The Upside

I wanted this movie to entertain me and give me a desperately needed 2 hour distraction from ""real life"" (being disabled myself, I can really enjoy a movie like this) and wiw, the movie delivered even more than i expected. It was hilarious and a bit sad, but in a good way. It was much deeper than I expected and that made it even better.
And the acting was superb. Not once did I ""see"" Heisenberg or Malcolm's dad.

This movie being based on a true story didn't take away from the movie at all! Nothing was over the top so nothing seemed to be added for a cheesy wow factor. The cinematography was subtile but it really set the mood for you knowing what and who we were trying to relate to at any given moment. Bryan did an amazing job conveying someone with an extreme disability, attempting to live out his life as harmoniously as possible while still anticipating the day it would all end. Kevin, let's talk about him! He did an amazing job not being his normal comedic self. Instead, his humor brought much needed laughs when needed. His serious side brought emphasis on the drama of the situation. All a balancing act only capable of an actor who is either known for being funny or known for more serious rolls. Without that expectation of seeing one of the two element's, the surprise of seeing the versatility of Kevin wouldn't have been as mesmerizing as it was.
All I can say is go into this movie open minded and light-hearted. Roll play while your at it, put yourself in the characters shoes and ask yourself how would you feel. It's seriously difficult to hate a movie that sparks so much emotion. Just keep in mind why your at the movies in the first place, to be submersed in a story.

I would have preferred to be told the story in a linear way, without the flashback thing. But that too, is fashionable nowadays.The cast is good and has chemistry. I even liked Nicole Kidman in this one. Normally, I don't like her, but in this one, she was really sweet and touching.What I didn't like much is the humor, often too goofy / slapstick / dumb for my taste. In those ""funny"" moments I often found myself checking my phone or going to get something to eat, out of vicarious embarrassment. It seems to be an American thing. In their movies, humor is often either mean or dumb.Overall, the movie works. I like the story, I like how the characters face themselves, grow, and save each other.

I have seen the original French version which by far has a better plot and set of actors. Cranston and Hart have a mild chemistry compared to Cluzet and Sy but it isn't all bad. I'm no fan of Hart but I must admit some lines were pretty funny. Cranston was alright as quadriplegic. Kidman was meh and in no way did better than her French counter part Fleurot. While the core was the same it was overall pretty different. It's alright for the most part, there were a few scenes that seemed to drag on and it just needed to be trimmed. The ending of the original film had me in tears, this one not even close. Just watch the original ""Intouchables""(2011) I'm the only one in my family who speaks decent enough French but they still saw it with me and all agreed it was a masterpiece. Just put subtitles(which I also needed) and you'll enjoy a much better version. This one isn't bad and watch it if you have nothing better to do.

To say that comparing isn't relevant, is just stupid! Of course it is!It IS tyiering how Americans always butcher good european films/tv shows!
Again: this is NOT the worst try!!!
But what the heck is wrong with just watching the original movie, and actually expanding yuur view of the World, and the people in it? And not americanishing/glossing everything up?Why are Americans so affraid of watching something real and non-american??WHY make a new movie, when the original IS Better??Kevin Hart is not bad at all! But he lacks the warmth, and underlaying irony, that the French actor had! Which to me, DOES make it a bit harder to believe in the deeb friendship, that is supposed to arise..""Malcoms dad"" (sorry I don't remember his name), does a really good version of the other main character in the movie! I actually think he nailed the feeling of the caracter!The ending.. OMG! 🙄 So american! Why?? I honestly hated that!Nichole kidman had the same problem, to me, as Kevin Hart.. She was not bad at all(!!), but was just more of a two dimensional character, than the French version. It is small differences! But it MAKES a difference! -When the French movie is still in such vivid memory!My point is just, why make a remake, that does not add to the original, when the original is still not very old!
This movie is not bad at all! But it does not quite come to the level of the original!Please don't cheat yourself from the real experience!!

Yeah, there was a lot of absurd stereotypes about race and disability. But it was presented well. Just like anyone can't tell the same joke as a comic and get the same reaction. I'm not crazy about Hart or Cranston (other than in Breaking Bad). But Hart was thoroughly believable in his lack of false sympathy for a quadriplegic, as Cranston was for ignoring the assumptions about a black ex-convict. It provoked thought about suicidal ideation of a man who had everything but control of his limbs. Or the streetwise Hart reinstalling the joy in those fantasies that most could not afford but to Cranston had become meaningless without physical abilities to enjoy them with. Each shared what they did have with the other. Sometimes overlapping like Aretha singing opera, or smoking a joint relieving phantom pain or instilling appetite. All the while involving we audience in their escapades or rooting for their successes. Just as we are still capable of laughing at SNL portraying societal disappointment.

Kevin gives us a fresh perspective on the clash of culture and shows us the brighter side of life's difficulties. Apart from the comedic relief and interesting morals there is a disorganization of this movies plot, comedy, and music selection.The emotional rollercoaster of a film and a lack of structure causes the viewer to gain a feeling of apathy after the first third of the film. For example, the introduction of each character is misplaced and not found from the start. The music too is out of place and does not match the emotional plot lines. There are many moments of 'here we go again'.All being said, the comic relief is relief from the rest of the movies poor structure and organization.

Both actors brought forward an amazing acting talent. Kevin Hart displays a wide range of emotions, from the deeply troubled minority average male to the beloved comedian we all know him to be. Bryan Cranston had an immensely hard role to play, with the camera set on his face the entire movie. You have to be an xtremely talented and expressive actor to play an entire movie only with your face, without the ability to use your body to support the role. And he pulled it through brilliantly.
We should not forget the script, based on a real-life story. Humor is used dazzlingly to introduce much deeper aspects of life. Since a direct approach of those aspect would have probably shocked the audience, humor is used as a conduit to open the mind to deeper analysis of those elements that give our life meaning, at a much higher symbolic and spiritual level than everything directly related to our body.

I'm sure you guys will love it I don't Often leave reviews but when a film like this comes up I feel I have too enjoy I'm sure you will love it the other two films that have done this but from a different angle are me before you and myother favourite is The untouchables that is a french version of this i prefer that one just ever so slightly,The Upside
371,marinaki_rw,Stop bringing down the rating for no good reason.,9,19 February 2019,"I don't usually write reviews but after watching this movie AND having watched the original one too , I felt like I needed to clear something up for the confused people that come here to see the reviews and figure out if the movie is worth watching and why its rating is only a 6.
Yes the French original is magnificent, yes it might be better BUT we are not here to compare, we are here to say if THIS particular movie is good and worth watching . And in my opinion it is .
It is a remake. It hasn't ""stolen"" the original script or anything like that . It's an American version with American actors . Why it was made, since there is already a great French one, is not the point . The point is the acting was very good ( I loved the chemistry between them) and the movie made, me and my family at least, feel a lot of emotions and we left the cinema feeling very satisfied with what we watched . So all the 1s or 2s and 3s I've seen in the reviews are just very, very unfair . You want to be resentful because the Americans made another remake of a good European movie ? At least rate it properly like an adult and not like a scorned child. And I am European by the way.

What I enjoyed about this is how it perfectly blends comedy and drama in a realistic way. One thing I enjoyed about The Upside is how likeable, but more importantly, honest and lifelike the characters felt like. People have their own preferences to what makes a great film and to me this is something I truly appreciate. My favorite thing would have to go to the performances of the lead cast. We know Bryan Cranston and Nicole Kidman are dramatically talented but kevin Hart deserves major praise for achieving a level that stands out amongst them. The chemistry between Hart and Cranston felt natural and only rivaled each other on who could be more likeable. Bryan Cranston deserves a lot of credit too, as I imagine portraying someone who could only move neck up, was quite the challenge. Lastly, I was surprisingly impressed with the cinematography as it was cleanly done and produced some truthfully spectacular looking shots.Now while I enjoyed the film, a lot of its conflicts did feel a little forced at times, however, this may be how it went in real life. I also think that some will make an argument that this film did not need to exist altogether. The original French film, The Intouchables, is already held in high regard and may even be better. Overall, I didn't have many real issues with this film other than these nitpicks.So I'll just come out and say it, I really enjoyed this film. I dont think it's perfect, and it may not be as good as the original, but that doesnt mean this isn't a great movie. I wasn't expecting to like this as much as I did and I would go as far as to say this is Kevin Harts best performance, and movie to date.

Cranston is one of my favourite actors (because of Breaking Bad) and I was intrigued by the idea of him playing a quadriplegic.You'll probably note a mixed bag of review here on imdb about this movie. Some people love it, and some hate it. I wanted to love it, and sometimes I did, but there were a too many cringe and annoying moments for me.Bryan Cranston did not disappoint. That's what made watching this even more frustrating. I didn't know much going into the movie and was surprised to see Nicole Kidman in it. I thought she did a fantastic job. Aja Naomi King and Jahi Di'Allo Winston were great.This is what I found difficult about the movie. Kevin Hart I thought made the scenario unrealistic. I find him to be a one character type of actor. If he played himself (a struggling comedian), that would make sense. Unfortunately it was difficult taking him seriously when the story line needed it. I get that the movie is a comedy-drama, but I felt there were only a few funny moments, overshadowed by the poor casting / acting of Kevin Hart.The other thing that bothered me was that the movie at times felt ""cheap"". There was something about the aesthetic & camera movements that made it feel amateur to me.Lastly, it seems like the original movie ""The Intouchables"" is too similar. It wasn't even made that long ago before this one. There is nothing that contributes or adds to the original and instead it feels like plagiarism.And with that, I end this review.",The Upside

Kevin Heart was the perfect actor for this role. Lots of great chemistry between the 2 actors. Thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable. And, the more I think of it, this is a film that has many life lessons that we can all think about and take in as a society. Those include the idea of 2nd chances and refraining from automatically judging a book by its cover. And, the boldest message in the film is that people should be more accepting and try not to look at everyones flaws, more importantly, to not let others opinions or thoughts get you down and to live your life regardless of what others think of you as a person. With lots of negativity and discrimination in the world, whether it be between different races, religions, etc, we as a society must learn to look past these differences and be more accepting. The film presents this in a very positive way and makes you feel genuinely good at the end. It is also a funny film with lots of good jokes and smart comedy as well.

The American version is staring Kevin Hart (a well-known stand-up comedian turned actor) as Dell Scott (the caregiver of Phillip Lacasse), Bryan Cranston (from Breaking Bad fame) as Phillip Lacasse (a paralysed person on a wheelchair), Nicole Kidman as Yvonne Pendleton, (Phillip's devoted personal assistance), Golshifteh Farahani as Maggie (Phillip's attractive physical trainer).Dell and Phillipe have a good relationship between music, women, etcetera. In their relationship a lot of ups and downs happen. Phillipe has a surprise party organized by Yvonne, but Phillipe wanted to have nothing for his birthday. Phillipe ask dell to break things for him because he was mad and uncapable from his quadriplegic condition. I found this scene emotional and heartbreaking. This scene was one of the best improvements to the original French version.Olivier Nakache and Éric Toledano are a duo writer. Their 3 other popular film are C'est la vie! (2017), The Specials (2019) and Tellement proches (2009) which they all made together! Intouchables is the most well like by the public. The English version is funnier at times, while the French version is more emotional between the two main characters.The Upside is a comedy. A lot of moment in The Upside has humor. The Intouchables and The Upside has still a lot of differences. In The Intouchables Driss (Dell in The Upside) likes Magalie (Yvone in The Upside) and flirts with here a lot. In The Upside Dell (Driss in The Intouchables) is making a lot of joke but Phillipe is more serious. But in The Intouchables the both are laughing and telling jokes more equally which makes for the stronger bond. It is a touching story, and fun that is based on a real life unlikely friendship like the Green Book.I will rate both 9/10. I recommend them.The Upside PG-13; 2h 6min; Comedy, Drama; 11 January 2019 (USA) Intouchables R; 1h 52min; Biography, Comedy, Drama; 2 November 2011 (France)",The Upside

The movie never left you wondering off to think of something else. You know from the beginning, part of the outcome of the movie, From that moment on you will be entertained positively.

There's a serious lack of chemistry between the leads. What Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy has in the original film was magical and the big reason the movie got an Oscar. The remake just shows how a couple of actors go through motions for a paycheque.2. The score in the original complemented the scenes much better, the remake is a bit too opera-heavy, perhaps trying to add sophistication to the movie, but it's just not working.3.

This movie, even though it starts more or less the same as the original one, is better than its source. It is like the author thought: 'Well, how to make a good movie even better?' And really nailed it.
So the story and the design of the characters, not going into detail, is really an improvement.

It is not Kevin Hart's (Dell) fault, his character was very badly developed. While I enjoyed the original for several times, It was hard to appreciate the characters of this remake. While Phillip and few others were the only to keep the character that did not absorbed the current social situation in the world.Dell, far not the same charming character of the last movie, not the good hearted guy neither the pleasant person Driss was.Dell, unlike Driss, is extremely toxic, the acting of his ""rude"" attitudes are not genuine, he acts childish and does not resemble someone from his background but someone that pretends to have that background. Dell behaves as everyone owns him something and I often noticed that his acting does not make sense. They did this remake using modern standards and social situation as fundament, which in my opinion spoiled completely the movie, while at parts turning the movie into some stupid porno movie beginning, stupid soap opera and a Mexican novel.I just did not give it 1/10 due the respect to the original movie.

498,b5fanatic,Critics are the Downside of the Upside (and Hollywood at large),7,11 January 2019,"There is a problem in the film critic community and I think it may be indicative of the problems in Hollywood/the Entertainment industry as a whole.Last night I went to see The Upside. I knew all the controversy surrounding it was about Kevin Hart and did he tell a Politically Incorrect Joke ten years ago that cost him his job, a possible Oscar nod, and derision from critics who would have otherwise given this movie a positive rating.The movie was honest, funny, and brought several serious issues to light that most people ignore: single fathers, the prison pipeline, depression, disability-and many more serious issues we hyper focus on: prejudice, racism, and the wealth gap. It was a simple, funny, entertaining movie that told a story with a happy ending. It wasn't deep. It wasn't preachy. That may have been why critics panned it. Or it could have been because Kevin Hart is now on the naughty list. Or maybe there was no reason to give the film an honest look-over because there was nothing in it for them, no presser to hobnob at, no invite to a party at some Hollywood elite. Or it could have been that critics are just so blind to story telling that they can no longer recognize a good one. Maybe they are as scared of the SJW twitter mob as they are of MAGA hat wearing hicks from the south.Has Antifa struck out at film critics yet?There is a lot of speculation of what that problem might be-if anyone was bothering to listen to ""the little people"" (ie: Normies, or even those now called the ""Intellectual Dark Web""). You can see this problem multiplying and metastasizing in the main stream media, especially with the Oscar hosting kerfuffle. The Oscars haven't had a good year of ratings in a decade, but it goes on blithely ignoring even the need for an audience, mocking, deriding and even calling for action on a sizable chunk of that audience that the Hollywood asskissing circle jerk can't even fathom are essential to their success.This isn't actually a new problem.Twenty years ago when I was writing for science fiction magazines/ezines, the problem existed, but scifi was a niche genre that still was struggling for appreciation and recognition from mainstream critics. Comic books were something only nerds read and Anime was still called Japanamation. The community was online, but it was tightknitdownload2and closed-not by desire, mind you, but by a decided lack of coolness that William Shatner and Patrick Stewart still couldn't bust out of.Then the brainchild that Stan Lee brought to life came into it's own, broke out of the Saturday Morning Cartoon shell, and now everyone knows about comic books, everyone watches scifi, and even pop stars sing about how cool things out of Japan are.The geeks and nerds grew up, started tech companies, rock bands, youtube channels, and internet platforms. Now anyone can be cool.When anyone can be cool-who is really cool?That seems to be the contest in Hollywood.The gap between Hollywood and the people that view their movies is becoming much wider than any wage gap, any wealth disparity or prejudice could produce, and their nepotism, insulation and inside-the-bubble mentality has never been more pronounced than it is now. That disparity becomes larger and larger with each passing year, and can be seen on Rotten Tomatoes scores, Amazon reviews, IMDB, Ratings, drives a public that is hungry for unifying, positive, story-telling (that so far they can only get in comic-book hero movies) that Hollywood seems determined to kill with as much vigor as Blade pursues vampires.It's a shame because the market is there. Even the movies, like The Upside, are there.

499,chris-pulleyn-1,"Ok as a remake, but still rewatching the original",6,9 May 2019,"I won't nag about this remake. I LOVED ""Intouchables"" gave it a big fat 10. Up there with Shawshank, still gave this a 7 but mainly because of the story, even if Hart doesn't have Omar Sy's blatant, raw, almost offensive humour or persona. I didn't believe Hart was street wise for a moment. They did mix up some of the original plot points which was confusing. Swapping the Love interest for the secretary, making good with the wife instead of the mother and the happily ever after at the end, was a bit too Holiwood Cliche Nice. It hints of formula. Still, it's a decent movie as is, but I'll still choose the original anyday.

Movies entertain us but they are even better when they can educate, entertain, and make us laugh at the same time. There have been no movies with big celebrity actors showing that a quadriplegic can actually live a regular life and have happiness. There were 2 big movies that came out and the quadriplegic chose suicide at the end. Instead of being looked at like a regular person, we are looked at with pity. Yes our life is hard! It's not easy being completely dependent on others for everything! It's been 22 years and I don't have millions of dollars or a fully accessible house or a nice ""patty wagon"" like Bryan's character had in the movie but I have God and family and friends and I live a good life! I still got a bachelors degree and I still found love and I was able to be a mother! We have fun and choose to laugh ALOT despite our circumstances. I hope everybody learns something from this movie!

Always had and always will. Sometimes they see eye to eye with everyday moviegoers but most of the time they don't. If a movie clicks with movie goers like myself and not them then they're looking at it from a perspective viewpoint that is based on personal feelings and opinions of their peers but with a subjective perspective one is open to greater interpretation based on personal feelings and emotions. I like the movie. I thought it was well done. Well acted by everyone. Bryan Cranston was very believable and really sold me as a man who had everything except what really mattered and Kevin hart who I enjoy as a performer really shined as an actor. The story followed 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th acts very fluidly and thought thought the strong characterization really sold me. Is it as good as Green Mile??

I don't understand why people are so upset about this remake. I never heard of the French movie until after watching this one. I'm a casual movie watcher and I like to use IMDB ratings as a guide of what I should watch. Quit bashing America for making remakes and we are running out of ideas. There are a ton of our best TV shows that get remade in other countries or just used with new voice actors. Talk about carbon copying. Never did I care that was happening. I just thought successful stories had a right to be shared. Additionally, it does have benefit of this story being depicted in New York City and America. I find it more relatable and touching. I would probably never have watched the French version or heard of this great story if it wasn't for this movie.",The Upside

586,jimmygott,"Uplifting, Inspiring, and Amusing",8,13 April 2020,"I recently watched The Upside directed by Neil Burger. Burger was also the director in the films Divergent, Limitless, and The Illusionist. The story is based off true events. The two main characters are Phillip Lacasse played by Bryan Cranston, and Dell played by Kevin Hart.
Phillip is a very wealthy author/poet who had lost his wife and all feeling in his limbs after an accident paragliding. The weather conditions weren't fit to go paragliding, yet they went on anyway. Phillip seems to regret everything about that day. His previous business partner and very good friend Yvonne, played by Nicole Kidman, are looking for a full-time caretaker. Phillip welcomes all job applicants into his massive penthouse for interviews with both him and Yvonne. All the applicants seem to care too much or seem to look at Phillip as if he's less than human. That is, until Dell storms in. Dell was only at the building originally to apply for the janitor position. Phillip and Yvonne are both unaware of this. Yvonne immediately dislikes Dell, but Phillip seems to find him very interesting and true and he offers him the position. Dell takes the day to think it over and becomes encouraged to accept the job due to a fight with his ex-girlfriend who is also the mother to his son.
On the first day of the job, Dell learns about what his job truly is and how to specifically care for all of Phillips needs. The humor in this part is fantastic. Kevin Hart truly plays his role spectacularly, whether it's getting confused in the shower, or driving the fanciest cars, he puts on a show. From this point on, Dell and Phillip grow closely together and form a very strong bond climaxing with Dell breaking items in his house to relive anger of Phillips. The music in this movie is vital to the idea of Phillip changing Dell. Phillip loves Opera and Dell at first hates it, but slowly, Dell becomes an Opera fan and it is very funny to watch. Dell seems to bring the best out of Phillip and vice versa. Dell, who had been failing to pay child support due to his criminal background and lack of job is now capable to pay and have a relationship with his family. This brings him immense joy. However, with all ups, there must be downs. Dell had called Phillips ""letter buddy"" named Lilly. Phillip seemed to not approve of Dell calling her, however he smiles once the call is over. Lilly is played by Julianne Margulies. Phillip and Lilly go on a date at a fancy restaurant and it ends on a very bad note. Phillip blames it on Dell and fires him along with pushing Yvonne away and everyone else who cares for him. Dell goes on to buy his family a new home which is nicer and bigger. He gets a job where he is making wheelchairs and seems to be very passionate about it. One of the people who care for Phillip show up to his store and asks him if he would stop by. Dell stops buy and takes him on a drive to a paragliding place. Phillip who is not expecting it at all is originally skeptic but turns out to have a great time. Of course, Phillip makes Dell fight his fears as well and the two seem to be back to being buds.
Overall, the cinematics don't seem to add quality to the film. I do believe the casting for this movie was perfect. Both Kevin Hart and Bryan Cranston play their roles to perfection. Yes, this is coming from a Kevin Hart fan, but still. I recommend this movie to all mothers, young men, and people in the upper class of society. These people can get the most out of the film, but I do believe everyone can take away something in particular. I give this film a 8.7/10 and recommend seeing. It is uplifting, inspiring, and amusing.",The Upside

594,mrd-80380,A Surprisingly Wonderful Remake,10,14 September 2021,"I watched the original film in a college class about French movies for my major, and, while I don't co sider myself pretentious in the slightest, I did not expect to enjoy this movie quite as much as i enjoyed the original. Oh wow, was I wrong! I really appreciate how they adapted Driss/Drell to American; in the French original, he was an immigrant, but in the American, he's an ex-con trying to do right by his son. I think that was a very thoughtful adaptation, and Kevin Hart really blew me away with his performance. What really surprised me, in the best possible way, was the remake of the original scenes; the car chase, the painting, the earlobes. I did not expect such detail retained in a remake! Of course, Bryan Cranson and Kevin Hart absolutely nailed it (exceeded my expectations, but I'm no critic by a longshot). I was nervous that the star-studded remake would overshadow the classic original but boy, was I surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. I really appreciate how much the directors/writers/etc appreciated the original movie enough. For those who have not seen Les Intouchables, this movie may just be average, but to those of us curious about the remake of this true story; it exceeds expectations. Bravo for not only incorporating the material, but also for subtly adapting it to a different cultural perspective.",The Upside
595,bleech-19917,An empowering flim,9,1 May 2021,"Based on a true story, The Upside stars Kevin Hart as Dell, an ex-convict looking to turn his life around for his teenage son. Phillip Lacosse, played by Bryan Cranston, is a wealthy, quadriplegic author who lost the ability to control his body from the neck down in a paragliding accident. Having lost all motivation in life, he takes a chance by hiring Dell to be his caretaker. The two form an unlikely bond as Dell shows him how to enjoy living despite his disability.When the viewer is introduced to Lacosse, he seems to be just another ableist stereotype. When Dell first begins working for Phillip, Phillip is clearly depressed and suicidal due to his disability. For example, he tells Dell to DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) if he ever stops breathing. His assistant calls him ""vulnerable"" and talks about him as if Phillip is not in the room. He experiences ableism often. For example, a neighbor sees Phillip and Dell leaving their building to go on a walk and says, ""Look at you, out and about, good for you!""However, Dell treats Phillip the same way he treats able people. He is sarcastic, joking, and sometimes rude to Lacosse. Dell doesn't let him make excuses as to why he can't live a fulfilling life. Phillip is empowered by this treatment and begins to do things that he would've done before his accident. With Dell, he dances, finds love, goes paragliding, etc. Dell sparks a newfound strength in Phillip. As a result, Lacosse abandons his identity as a person with quadriplegia and reclaims his individuality. The Upside was successful in revealing the depth and strength in Lacosse's character that challenges stereotypes. The movie shows that disabilities don't limit how much a person can love living.",The Upside

I have more medical equipment in my living room than I normal furniture. I preface my review with all of that because when I see movies, like, The Upside, they draw a very harsh eye from me, especially when they do not employ actors who have disabilities playing characters who have disabilities, that is a tender spot. But it is acting, so I do give it a chance, and in this case I am very glad that I did.
The Upside was pleasantly surprising without being sugary. I was Glad to see that none of the characters dissolved into the obvious and expected stereotypes of ex-con redeemed by working with disabled, hardened millionaire who relearns his will to live.
I really wish that this movie was required viewing for everyone who works in any capacity as a caregiver for a person who has a disability.Thank goodness I was watching the movie at home because I found myself talking to the screen and and cheering when Bryan Cranston's character stands up for himself in the scene when Kevin Hart's character is feeding him the first time.

Also spectacular were the night and day scenes of the city of Philadelphia.I thought Brian Cranston's incredible acting chops were brilliantly displayed using only his face and voice to express ALL of his feelings which complements and contrasts Kevin Hart's performance which relies heavily on facial and bodily movements to create belly rolling laughter.

I do remember thinking the original may have had more weight to it at times, but that's not to say this newer version cut corners. I think of Little Women and Jane Austen films...they've been remade far too many times. However, when you have such strong source material filmmakers can't help themselves. I'll admit to watching (and enjoying) multiple renditions. In this case, I'm glad I did the same. I hope the actual gentlemen are proud of and honored by these films, despite any artistic license taken. They are both well worth seeing.

659,preciousene61,A thoughtfully crafted remake addressing modern-day issues.,7,13 January 2019,"The Upside is a thoughtfully crafted remake of the French original, Untouchable, addressing modern-day issues. The movie follows Phillip Lacasse, played by Cranston, a paralysed billionaire in search for a new Life Auxiliary - or to any trigger black person watching this, a modern-day slave. Lacasse requires a daily helping hand to get through everyday tasks and activities and he hires Dell Scott, played by Kevin Hart, to take on this position at the disinclination of his business employee, Yvonne (Nicole Kidman).The movie cleverly explores current issues around racism, stereotypes and privilege, injecting light humour in the right places to break up the pent-up tensions. A few key messages that I picked up on were that often people have more money than sense, but it pays to be in the right place at the right time. And that the majority of underprivileged people only end up in the wrong situations due to their environment - they aren't actually bad people, but society never really gives them a chance to begin with.The character development was subtly spread throughout the film and we continue to learn more about each character's complex personality as the story unfolds. I loved that the character development in this film wasn't retrospective because it felt like we were discovering more about the character at the same time they were discovering something new about themselves. The shared discovery drawing the audience ever closer to each character.The chemistry between the three main characters was great and felt very natural. I'm really impressed with Kevin Hart's performance - for me this is the first time he's had a role in a seriously dramatic film and he was able to do it well but not lose his comedic edge. Personally I love everything that Bryan Cranston does and this was another stand-up performance - pun intended. I'm a huge fan of Julianna Margulies and I was pleased to see her cameo in this picture.Overall I think this was a great movie and I could have happily sat in the cinema for another hour. This film was originally aired in 2017 at the Toronto Film festival, but due to complications with the production company was sadly held back from movie theatres. I'm glad we were finally graced with this picture and I'd recommend you all go out and watch it.",The Upside

So I have watched the europen version, which I assume was the first since it was released in 2011. I liked it so much, because it had some real human emotions put into it, both from the actors as screenplay and the from the producer's team as caption frames. Also it dig really deep into the people with similar or the same diagnostic - quadriplegic.
The Upside did not come very near the emotion that the Intouchables had, but it was ever moving. It had laughs, deep conversations about people relationship in general, some underdog element, that is essential to telling this kind of story.
Overall I liked the movie. Kevin Hart made me see him in another perspective, one that is not always so funny, and that is crucial to the movie's plot. Bryan Cranston was brilliant with his role. He made it, at lease in my eyes, through my feelings and has gotten a very big thumbs up from me.In general i thought, that the movie is a well devised film. It transported the emotion from the wholes story, so i believe it was a success. I only missed a few more intimate human emotions. It would have been alot more touching. It could have had more poking around in the humans emotion and mind, in which the main characters were found in. I mean more deeply explored ones mind in such a state, both the rich man and the poor.A humans emotion is essential to its being.",The Upside

726,icecreammonster-04271,Better than it's being given credit for.,8,24 January 2019,I have no idea why this is unfairly rated so low as it's a decent watch. This is a solid seven maybe an eight even as quality modern comedy/comedy dramas that are actually funny are few and far between. I've gone with the eight to help balance out to a more realistic rating. It's not a rip off as some have ranted. It's a remake (one of several from various countries around the world based on the original French 'based on true story' movie - 'the intouchables' ) it states it's origins quite openly so therefore not a rip off. The story revolves around the hiring of a somewhat questionable man by a very wealthy quadriplegic to look after him and the situations that that brings between two very different personalities and people of different social backgrounds. Here a very good job is done by both Bryan Cranston and Kevin Hart in bringing this story successfully to another audience that may otherwise not get the chance to see it. Watch it - you might like it. As rated by 'icecreammonster',The Upside

But with the new trailer, you can see some telltale differences. This new version looks to be more comedy and less drama. It's a choice, neither good or bad. I liked the original, but this one could be fun. Cranston is a good actor, Hart has descent comedy skills. I'd give it an honest chance.Oh and to everyone calling the original 'The Intouchables'.

738,JPM-Ulti,A rather bad copy which was not necessary,3,12 April 2020,"The Upside or The Intouchables in US sauce. Even if the film tries to stand out from it several times, it is quite difficult not to make a comparison with the French film, as so many scenes are cut and paste with a few differences. If the performances of Kevin Hart and Bryan Cranston are rather honorable, I found the other actors generally insipid, in particular Nicole Kidman. Likewise, the film turns out to be quite poor in emotions and subtleties, despite a second part of the script that stands out a little more from The Intouchables. In the end, if The Upside lets itself be watched, the copy rendered is not very interesting, and suffers too much from the comparison with The Intouchables.",The Upside

This was less of a soapy Hollywood fairy tale and had FAR more developed, nuanced and relatable characters by miles and it completely baffles me how many critics, and how the academy totally missed it. Nicole Kidman was WONDERFUL and that little boy who played Kevin Heart's son is a young actor Hollywood would do well to keep their eyes on, talk about exceptionally well rounded performances.

The cast blended and worked together for the good of this movie! The entertainment industry would bode well to make more feel good movies in the future!,The Upside
805,kathleenemmerson,Laugh Out Loud,8,21 January 2019,I saw the original which I enjoyed and I enjoyed this one as well. Chemistry between Hart and Cranston was effective. Many laugh out loud moments. Definitely entertaining.,The Upside

809,sequencejackson,A Must See,10,31 January 2019,This is my first time reviewing which Im happy to do. The Upside was amazing! It had a nice good vibe that felt natural to the soul. This movie is like hot cocoa on a rainy saturday morning. I was really able to appreciate every minute of it with its encouraging displays of love and friendship. This movie is the kind you can watch knowing your emotions will have a boost. A must see. See it for yourself without expectation and you can be taken in by its charm.,The Upside
810,momtosofar,Great movie,10,1 February 2019,"I am not sure why the rating is so low on here, i almost missed out on this gem based on the 6.1 rating. This film has a nice balance of drama and humor, appropriate for the subject matter. Finally a good film with with good acting! The story and relationship development far outshines the more popular films of late.",The Upside
811,morallesdiego,I like it and dont regret spending the money to watch it.,7,31 March 2019,"The Upside offers something I like to watch in films, a touching friendship. Although if I had one minor complaint it would be that the stolen book arc really is forgotten quickly and doesn't add much to the plot.",The Upside
812,miroslavuzice,Apsolutely come to me as a shock!,10,1 February 2019,"I was amazed. At the end of a movie I just couldn't believe how deep and well rounded this story is. Characters are just perfect and the acting is supreme. Going from laugh to sadness then greed, then happiness, then cry, this movie has it all. Going to movie and not knowing what to expect from this movie was best decision that week - thanks God I did it!",The Upside
813,ggonblouin,Thank you,10,19 April 2019,"Hollywood filmmaking, whether original screenplay, from a book, or as a remake of another country's group of artists, rarely gives audiences a sense of learning something new, unless in a documentary. By nature, they entertain us by carrying us away from our own lives, if only for a couple of hours. But to do that, AND enlighten us at the same time is a gift to us, the audience. That's why I say thank you to everyone involved in this project, in front and behind the camera. Please take a bow. You deserve it. And thank you to the Queen of Soul too!",The Upside
814,haydenIMDb,Touching and thought-provoking,9,18 February 2019,"This movie was not at all what I was excpecting. I was expecting some sort of comedy as Kevin Hart movies usually deliver, and while this movie did deliver a considerable amount of laughs, it had a much greater meaning. This movies allows you to feel a connection between two very different people, you feel just as connected as if you are in the story. I know this is a remake and I do plan to try and watch the original, but coming from having not seen the original I would say this movie is definitely worth a watch and good time spent for anyone who chooses to go. Thanks.",The Upside
815,minnick-44569,Great movie,10,23 February 2019,Very funny movie. The best part is when the shower goes crazy.,The Upside
816,jolenekwarner-08942,Incredible Movie -- Negative Reviews are Not Reflective of Film,9,26 February 2019,"Unfortunately this movie has been covered with negative reviews due to it being a ""remake"", a ""knockoff"" etc.I have never seen the original, and I'm sure that the original was fantastic and when compared to the original I can see why people would have a difference in opinion.But on its own I thought this movie was incredible and refreshing. I think this kind of role suits Kevin Hart and would love to see him in similar ones.If you've seen the original maybe I wouldn't go see it in theatres because many of the reviews mention the story line being a carbon copy, but I would not write it off.",The Upside
817,daqubacca,Do I HAVE to watch the original?,8,4 March 2019,"The fact that this is a remake does not make this a bad movie. There are plenty of remakes and, yes, they do happen. The original might be better, but I don't enjoy foreign films all that much, so I probably won't ever find out.As it's own movie, this one was great. I was glued to my seat the whole way through, never did the plot or acting feel outrageous. It was funny when it needed to be, and emotional, but not overburdened. Mr. Hart and Mr. Cranston worked brilliantly together, and an extra shoutout to Kevin Hart for an awesome performance, proving that his talent is well-rounded and he is not a one-trick-pony. Cranston is, as always, a force to be reckoned with.This film was enjoyable. Is the original better? Maybe. Most likely. If you're into that sort of thing. Should you watch it? Why not? It's in French, so I probably won't unless it comes up somehow or I learn a beautiful language. Does the original make this movie bad? Does a great burger make a good burger objectively bad?",The Upside
