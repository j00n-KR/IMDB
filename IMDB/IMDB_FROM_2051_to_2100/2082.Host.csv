0,morrison-dylan-fan,Unfriended.,5,26 December 2020,"Watching a review on YouTube by Double Toasted,I was surprised to hear them mention a code for free 30 days on the streaming service Shudder. Signing up,I decided the film film I'd unlock to view,was one I've heard a lot about under Lockdown.View on the film:Zooming into production during Lockdown, co-writer/(with Gemma Hurley & Jed Shepherd) director Rob Savage displays a inventiveness in creating chills,whilst filming under social distancing, via sudden close-ups on the screen capturing how helpless the others are in being unable to help out.Wisely kept to a lean runtime of under an hour, Savage dials this Found Footage with surprisingly creepy special effects, where the limited bedrooms location gives the moving chairs and shattering glass,a invasion of personal space eerie atmosphere.Making Haley regret her prank on the call, the writers take the major plot point from the interesting Hammer Horror title The Quiet Ones (2014-also reviewed),and wastes it,with little drama coming from the accidental conjuring,instead going for Found Footage jolts and jump-scare crashing sounds, over poor performances across the call,with the cast failing to create the impression of being mates before the call is cut.",Host
1,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Enjoyable and chilling if quite problematic,6,27 August 2020,"Meeting together for a video chat, a group of friends stuck in quarantine attempt to conduct a seance for their apartments, but when they inadvertently insult the spirit guest they're hosting the angry spirit exacts vicious and brutal revenge on the group for what they did.This was a decent enough genre effort while there are a few detrimental issues here. When this one works is due to the idea of this all happening at once over the video-call, where the darkened atmosphere in their rooms creates a somewhat intriguing setup that allows all the supernatural antics to feel somewhat believably. The longer it goes on, the more the strange knocks, flashing lights and smashing objects feel more intense and creepy, especially once the attacks become physical as that's where the intensity picks up. Several of these scenes are outright terrifying when viewed through the format, taking full advantage of the intimacy created to provide some fantastic shocks. These are what manage to hold the film up as there are several issues to be had with this one. One of the biggest drawbacks is the inability to care about anything that the girls do which rarely seems to bee worth following around. The first half here is insanely dull and bland before the seance starts with inane chatter and conversations between everyone about how they're handling the lockdowns or screwing around on the various processes involved with the computer call to get anything out about them. That they then go through the cliched notion of outright disrespecting the seance and then lying and arguing about everything like it wasn't their fault cements how unlikable they are. The other issue with this one is the strange series of choices featured here for the attacks that make no sense. The byproduct of this one being done through the internet video chat means that a lot of what happens should've never been recorded. Taking the camera or computer with them when they're being hunted and stalked by an unknown malicious source attacking them is the least of their worries and being able to capture what happens is quite unrealistic in this setup, while all that tends to crop up elsewhere on the chat is the others screaming without doing anything such as calling for help. This strikes as quite problematic and doesn't do much to help this one, lowering the film somewhat.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Language and Violence.",Host
2,trashgang,slow starter that turns in one big scary jumpscene,7,11 September 2020,"Hyped all over the media as the flick made in full quarantine. And guess how they did it, with Zoom, Everybody was and still is using Zoom, Skype or Linkelo to make contact with friends in our new way of life.So that makes you attracted to the screen because you do know, this could happen to me.Starts as a big joke some friends wanted to make contact with spirits things go wrond when one of theml thinks y-to make a joke. From that joke you are almost halfway this flick. Clocking in under 60 minutes this must start from there and it luckily did.Once the evil is out there this flick turns from Unfriended into Paranormal Activity and even goes a lot deeper into the effects then Paranormal Activity.Second half it's all about jump scenes, scary moments.It's not one for everybody out there being a found footage and loks like the loved/hated Paranormal Activity.Did I like it, yes I did but first part takes a bit too long.

3,FeastMode,GET PULLED!,2,14 July 2021,"This movie is not terrible. Yet it gave me nothing of value. I found it zero scary and barely creepy while also being really boring... the 57 minute movie bored me. In between the boring parts, we sometimes see someone get pulled (not a euphemism lol).No intrigue in a bare-bones story. This is basically a cheap knockoff of paranormal activity, which seems like it would be difficult to do since it was one of the cheapest mainstream movies of all time (yet very scary).I wonder if they had to film separately during the pandemic or if they chose to in order to make a dirt-cheap movie. If it's the former, i give them small props. If not, they get zero props. Part of what makes movies great is the cinematic feel, which you will never get from watching a zoom call with laptop cams (1 viewing, 7/13/2021)",Host
4,Edvis-1997,4,4,7 August 2020,"It's far overrated. Plot was quite average, let's say ""okay"". Friends calling to exoteric to have some laugh and good time (not very creative) and gets evil spirit in each house. Come on... How's that can be interesting or have 6.8 IMDB rating? There are so many movies with same or similar idea that are way better like ""Paranormal activity"" or "" Unfriended: Dark Web"". I wouldn't offer to watch this movie because it's lack of action, it's not scary in any way and gets boring after first 5-10minutes.",Host
5,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Do ghosts need masks, too?",7,7 February 2021,"Clocking in at just under an hour, 'Host (2020)' is a short but sweet horror film about a virtual séance that goes wrong. It pretty much keeps escalating until it reaches its chaotic finale, playing out entirely in real time under the guise of a Zoom meeting. Our perspective shifts between the call's various participants (though we usually see more than one person at once) as they try to survive the night. For what it is, the flick is done really well. The video-chat aesthetic is pulled off convincingly. Plus, the narrative fits around the restrictions of the concept fairly well, even though there are one or two hitches in logic here and there (I mean, why would you cart around an entire laptop while sneaking through a haunted apartment?). The thing isn't likely to scare you in any lasting way; it's not the sort of thing that gets under your skin or keeps you awake at night. However, it works well as an in-the-moment 'haunted house'. It's shocks are meant to entertain, not horrify, and they do a good job of remaining varied and impactful throughout. The affair is a good example of working with what you have and turning limitations into advantages. Right now, it's rather resonant; who hasn't used video-chat at this point? Its COVID elements, which aren't a massive part of it but are certainly important to the plot, will date it but they won't spoil it. Besides, it'll be nice when we have to explain why the flick's characters can't have a traditional face-to-face séance to those who aren't aware of the world right now. Ultimately, the movie is entertaining and well-paced. It's a strong effort. 7/10",Host
6,dromasca,horror on Zoom,7,11 January 2021,"It was only a matter of time before the first films inspired by the lockdown periods imposed by COVID-19 appeared. 'Host' (2020) by British director Rob Savage is not only one of the first horror films made during the pandemic, but it is a film that uses the collective experience of what we have lived through and are living through in the last year. Zoom teleconferencing software with which at least half of humanity has become familiar is one of the main technical means that define the film both visually and thematically. It can be said that 'Host' has the ambition to become something similar to what was 'The Blair Witch Project' over 20 years ago, only that the role of the video camera is taken over by Zoom teleconferencing. Remarkably, the ambitions of the director and the producers are largely achieved.
Six friends (five women and one man) meet in a Zoom conference, one of those that have become familiar for many people during long and repeated periods of lockdown. Everyone is at home, in the environment in which they feel best. For entertainment, they decide to invite a medium who will organise a spiritualism seance on Zoom. The guest warns them that although it takes place online, the seance can summon the spirits, that there may be signs of the presence of those who have left this world and that the spirits must be respected. The friends don't really take the warnings or the session in general very seriously. The man leaves the conference after a few minutes, one of the girls allows herself a prank of those that can arouse spirits, the internet connection of the medium moderator is interrupted, and from here things start to get complicated. We slip into the world of internet spiritism, which turns out to be a nightmare. Lockdown can protect against viruses, but not from the actions of spirits.
Rob Savage makes excellent use of Zoom conferencing conventions to build the visual concept of the film and to create the feeling of fantastic. One of the laws of the genre says that the horror effect is amplified when dangers appear unexpectedly in an environment that is familiar and that normally suggests protection. Zoom conferences have become a psychological comfort for us by connecting with the world, family, friends. In the film, they do represent a socialising framework between friends at first, but as things get more complicated the temporary virtual community created by the conference turns into a space gradually invaded by horror. The familiar Zoom grid is used to create the split screen effect in which some of the participants are spectators, only to become actors or even victims. The effect is effective and shocking. The film lasts a little less than an hour, which would be too little for a commercial distribution but works perfectly in screening. I think Rob Savage did very well not to add time, and in addition the duration of the movie falls within a standard duration for many Zoom conferences. The actors' performances are all excellent and the remote interaction works just as well as in any conference. 'Host' is a minimalist and efficient film, intelligently using convention and transforming the computing environment limitations into qualities and means of expression. I read that director Rob Savage is preparing a new film that could be considered a sequel. I just hope that it will include enough new and independent material. The precedent exists, as the sequel films of 'The Blair Witch Project', although much more generously funded, were far from equaling the success of the original. The expectations created by 'Host' are high.",Host
7,851222,You have seen it all many times in better movies,5,26 January 2021,"Greetings from Lithuania.The first mistake of ""Host"" (2020) i think that in its 56 min. length it was hardly possible to establish 4 or 5 characters at the same time. There was only a situation and jump scares - and that is it, that is the whole thing (I can't even call it a full feature film). In ""Host"" you get a premise as old as a Blair Witch herself. And we have seen all this stuff being done so many times, and in a so many better horror film. Even a first ""Paranormal Activities"" movie was a masterpiece in comparison with this one, because it took its time to establish situation and characters. Unfortunately ""Host"" doesn't have any of this. And there is also one dude Teddy i think was his name, who was so obnoxious that i was pretty happy when he was out of the picture at the end so to speak - literally.Overall, ""Host"" isn't a terrible movie, and you can see an attempt to make something good on a very low budget and premise. That is not a bad thing, if its done right. But in 56 min. you only get bunch of jump scare scenes with some faces on a laptops. This is what ""Host"" basically is.",Host
8,nairtejas,Good Topical Horror / 6 Stars,6,21 August 2020,"Host is an enjoyable horror flick that seems cliched, and it definitely is, but with some novelties. The Zoom meeting part is attractive plus topical, and makes the whole viewing more delightful if you can relate with it. It's the usual story where a group of unsuspecting friends get together on an online call to hold seance and things go wrong. Just about an hour long (in line with Zoom's 40-minute free call version) and worth the watch. It won't disappoint. TN.",Host
9,eddie_baggins,The horror film 2020 needed,7,2 February 2021,"Before 2020 came around the idea of a 56 minute horror film taking place entirely on online meeting platform Zoom would've felt like a gimmick gone too far but with 2020 being the year that it was, Shudder backed and released Host against all the odds becomes one of the Covid-19 riddled years most memorable little horror offerings.Feeling as though its been cut from the same cloth as the material used for films such as The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity, Rob Savage's creatively designed feature may not offer anything particularly new in a narrative sense or scare sense but with all of us growing more accustomed to meetings and get togethers virtually, as well as being locked inside our own houses, Host manages to capture the time in which it has been born into and also creep us out with well plotted jump scares and moody set ups.Following a group of 6 English friends who decide its a good of a time as any to hold a séance, this time with a twist being a virtual one, Host does a nice job of introducing us to our unsuspecting group of everyday working-class citizens pent up inside and looking for a release only to discover conjuring up spirits is not the greatest of pastimes, especially when you're home isolated from the world around you.Rollicking along at a break neck pace, Host rarely pauses for a breath as we quickly grow to understand that the spirit this group has welcomed into their Zoom meeting isn't the type of one that will be bringing much of a good time to the friendship circle and that's a wise move from Savage as we are never given time to pause to contemplate how intense things are getting or what type of decisions characters are making.Host is a prime example of what can be done in the horror genre when you use nothing but some smartly designed narrative choices and carefully consider how you will shock the audience and the film is likely to provide viewers with more than a fair share of jump scares that culminates in some of the more memorable final minutes of horror from the 2020 calendar year.Final Say -Ingeniously incorporating Zoom into its narrative, there might not be anything outstanding about Host's narrative or its concept but this brief foray into horror done by the way of 2020 is a memorable ride and one that never outstays its welcome.3 1/2 off camera shots out of 5",Host

11,subxerogravity,A++ to the filmmakers who thought out of the box and didn't let COVID 19 scare them into not making a movie,7,21 August 2020,"Snice the Quarantine, I've been a dude who uses Zoom every single day for work and as such the idea of watching a movie done with zoom felt like being at work, but I give the filmmaker's credit, it's a decent horror movie.Not surprising how by the numbers this horror movie is but they only had 56mins (about the time of an average Zoom meeting).Host has at least three Scenes that were genuine seat jumpers that made me happy I kept the lights on.It has one Scary scene that's not really that scary, but if your like me and you use zoom all the time you'll love this scene.As a whole it is a horror movie that truly expresses the time we live in, and lucky for them they did it first cause you know more are coming.Very good! Very impressive!",Host
12,jtindahouse,"A very short, but extremely creepy and frightening horror film",9,10 August 2020,"'Host' is remarkably short. It is less than an hour long. I've seen no reason for why this runtime was accepted. The weird thing though was that I kind of liked it. It meant there was no time for mucking around. Things had to take place at an electric pace, and they did. I would've liked to see 30 more minutes worth of this film (because it was incredibly good), but maybe the reason it was so good was that it didn't outstay its welcome. I'm a little torn on this issue. Would I like to see more films adopt a similar runtime in the future? Possibly. I wouldn't want to pay to go the theatres for a film this short, but if they're coming to streaming services I'd be okay with it.It's a well known fact that what you can imagine is far scarier than what you can see. This is why a film like 'Host' works so well. Similar to the brilliant 'Paranormal Activity' films, 'Host' presents a clear and present danger, but doesn't inform us of exactly what it is. That is such a creepy concept and works so well in movie form.The film uses some good innovation to create unique and unforeseen scares. It took me off guard on multiple occasions. And even late in the film when I categorically knew a scare was coming, and even how they were going to do it, it still gave me a hell of a fright. This was a very well made and well put together horror film that I would suggest is well worth checking out.",Host
13,jadavix,The new Paranormal Activity/Blair Witch Project?,9,23 December 2020,"So, here is a pretty fantastic horror movie. I had reservations about watching it because it's filmed entirely through Zoom, which felt like an irritating gimmick, but I got used to it pretty quickly and didn't even notice it after a while.This could be the newest ""Paranormal Activity"", or ""Blair Witch Project"". You know, low budget movie, no-name (but fantastic) actors, get together and make a genuinely scary movie.The fact that it is only an hour long is a strength, as there is barely any extraneous material in the movie.I say check it out.",Host

20,aidanratesmovies,Quite good,9,27 September 2020,"Surprisingly scary, well acted, and well shot- Host makes the most out of our current situations by giving us a glimpse of horror in our all too familiar reality. I'll start with the flaws. The film can be a bit formulaic in its setup, mainly the slow start to build suspense, although it is obviously necessarily. It has a few tropes up its sleeve, but for the most part, Host proves to be a rather clever and wonderfully scary horror film that I quite enjoyed. Everyone really did give their best performances. Although I feel I can't necessarily pick a standout, since all together the cast is rather good, I feel the need to give credit to Emma Louise Webb- who carried the film single handedly in a huge chunk. The film isn't very long, in fact, its a little less than an hour, but it still makes the most of its time frame to provide for truly brilliant scares and suspense that will have you gasping of shock at the screen in front of you. In the end, Host is a low budget masterpiece, and on its own, a really good little horror flick. Give this one a try!

21,valleyjohn,"Short , sweet and spooky.",7,14 March 2021,"Host is probably the scariest and most inventive of the modern horrors that are set entirely online .
Short and sweet and to the point this attempts to scare the bejesus out of you and for the most part succeeds.It's the story of a group of friends who decide , during lockdown , to have a seance over zoom - why not ?!
Inevitably things go very wrong and because it's filmed entirely on a screen it really feels like you are involved in it all .Being an old bugger and not spending my entire life online I don't think it's really aimed at me but I did enjoy it but not as much as my teenage kids .It reminded me a little of Paranormal Activity . A film that was groundbreaking at the time but who's format soon got tired . Sadly the online film will go that way too but for the most part it was good scary fun.",Host
22,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Solid Take on the Seance/Haunting Film with Technology,8,25 August 2020,"This was a film that I kept hearing a lot about and was intrigued to check out. It seems that some people really liked it while others not so much. Since it was a 2020 film and had a short runtime, I decided to give it a viewing on Friday night with Jaime. I'll get into it a bit later how it effected us later. First though, the synopsis is six friends hire a medium to hold a séance via Zoom during lockdown, but they get far more than they bargained for as things quickly go wrong.We start this movie off with Haley (Haley Bishop), starting a Zoom meeting. She invites a bunch of her friends and we follow as she gets herself set up. While she is away from her computer, someone tries to join, but needs to be accepted. Haley hears things being thrown at her window and she checks to see it is Jemma (Jemma Moore). She then accepts her and Jemma goes home to get on her computer as well.The rest of the crew starts to join of Emma (Emma Louise Webb), Radina (Radina Drandova) and Caroline (Caroline Ward). We get to learn a bit about some of them through these early interactions. Jemma is a bit of a prankster. Radina just moved in with her boyfriend at the start of quarantine, Alan (Alan Emrys). Things aren't going great as they really don't know each other. Caroline lives at home with her dad and we see she also has set up in Zoom a background that is her walking into her room, opening a drawer and brushing her hair.Someone who also joins is their friend Teddy (Edward Linard). He has also moved in with his rich girlfriend, Jinny (Jinny Lofthouse) at her parents' place. Finally Seylan (Seylan Baxter) joins who is their medium. She tries to get them to take this seriously, but it isn't going well from the start. Teddy leaves when Jinny interrupts and closes his laptop.When they finally settle in, Jemma is spooked by something. She claims someone grabbed her neck and that his name is the same as someone she knew when she was a child who was nice to her. She is shaken up and something weird happens on Seylan's screen. She is removed from the Zoom meeting. After she disappears, Jemma reveals the truth. The problem though is that something really starts to happen as each of the women and Teddy, when he finally rejoins. There is something messing with them and it could be a spirit that they conjured.Now that's where I want to leave my recap as I don't really want to go into spoilers, but give you a bit more background and expanding on the synopsis. What I gave is literally half of the movie. What I find interesting is that from my understanding as I've never held a Zoom meeting, but the free version only allots you about an hour. This movie has a runtime of 56 minutes so I dig that they're keeping with the realism. I will say that I have done a few Zoom meetings with friends during this quarantine, so being able to understand helps.Next I should say this movie did freak me and Jaime out. I don't think it will work on everyone, but some of things that happen tick boxes for me. What I like is that we can see things happening behind characters who don't always know it is. Other characters on the meeting will notice it sometimes and that just helped to ramp the fear up for me. We get some effective things that are just glimpses at times. It is enough to freak me out, but not enough for me to critique it.I have heard some people saying that having been stuck in the house for this quarantine and needing to use Zoom to see friends or for work, they don't want to see it in their entertainment. Maybe since for me, I don't use it a lot, I actually really dig the concept and what they did here. Do I think this movie is great? No, I think it is good though. I have a feeling that when life goes to a new normal, we're going to look back at this little time capsule and be more impressed with what this movie did. I've heard a few different titles thrown around for what to call it and Desktop Horror seems to be the one gaining traction. It is a subgenre of the subgenre of found footage. The ones I've seen so far, I dig it.What really makes this work for me is the realism of what they're doing here. None of the actresses really stand out, but I could feel like they all have a relationship and know each other, so I give credit there. Haley gets annoyed with Jemma for not taking it seriously. Jemma seems like that friend so props to Moore how she played it. Webb seems like the younger one in the group where Bishop feels like someone cooped up who wants to do something different. There are hints that Drandova might make rash decisions that aren't always the best and her friends know it. Ward lives with her father and it seems like she's a good person there to help him out. The rest really do round out to help shape them, but this is all I got in such a small timeframe from their interactions. I find that to be pretty impressive to be honest.Being that this is a type of found footage movie where we are just getting the desktop video of all of them or from their phone, it makes it interesting with the frames we get. For a lot of the movie, we're seeing the gallery view of Zoom where all of them are on screen. What I liked here is that I'm trying to rapidly look through all of their frames for what is going to happen. It kept me engaged. It will zoom in and focus like you would get if you have speaker mode, to highlight the one talking. They seem to use as many of the features as you can as well of Zoom. I thought the look of the spirit in the movie was quite creepy. We only get glimpses, but that is more terrifying for me sometimes. Aside from that, we get some cool haunting effects that seem to be done practical for the most part. I can really only think of something with Jinny done with CGI. It didn't look great, but I'm not taking away anything there.The last thing to cover would be the sound design. We don't get music at all, which I'm glad. It adds to the realism of the footage. What we do get is ambient sound. There's a music box that Teddy has that is creepy when we hear it. There are bumping noises and things to this effect as well. It really helps to add to the ambience of what they're going for which helped to build tension for me.Now with that said, I thought what this movie did was pretty effective for me. Is this going to be loved and found terrifying for everyone? No it won't. It worked for me though. I like the realism of the length of the movie with a Zoom session. What they did for the haunting of people was good and it uses things that freak me out. The acting isn't great, but it doesn't have to be. It felt natural of a group of people that know each other and I picked up little things about each of them. The effects were good and the ambient use of sound was as well. I would say this is a good movie and would recommend it if all of what I'm saying works for you.",Host
23,begob,Host with a ghost,6,17 August 2020,"Six friends gather online for a seance during lockdown, but end up sending out the wrong invitation.Pretty much the same set up as Unfriended, using the tried and failed idea of getting the characters to sit around and face each other ... hang on - the cheesiest device in horror just found its perfect scenario!This is pretty good. With no opportunity for a wide shot of a car travelling on a country road, the director just gets down to business with the characters. The performances are fine, given there's so little back story or history to work with. The process of going through the looking glass is gradual, although the pace does pick up about half way through, and it all fits nicely into the run time.Some decent frights, but nothing original, and the mythos is fuzzy as a couple of kills happen outside the circle of the seance. Also, the title suggests a particular plot device on the Zoom platform, but I don't think that was followed through. A big problem with jump scares is that they need good sound design, but in this format and these circumstances it's not available. Plus the only music is internal, which really limits the horror effect.In the end, I was hoping for a reveal to cause a sharp intake of breath, like in Rec or Blair Witch, but no luck.Still, it's an improvement on Unfriended, which also had a neat concept but was way too busy with onscreen information and stuffed with gurning performances. But that was five years ago, and we have yet to see the computer screen deliver the same intelligence as the cameras in Blair Witch.Overall: One small step on horror's road to hell.",Host
24,Foutainoflife,I Give 6.5 Stars To This Zoom Seance,7,3 October 2020,"Plot is simple enough. A group of friends connect through zoom, during quarantine, to have a seance. It's all fun and games until it's not.Not bad. This had a far creepier atmosphere than Unfriended (2014). I believe they made a sequel to that but I've not watched it. This did, however, come across much darker. It has some decent jump scares and nice visuals. The actors were relatable and did a good job overall. It was pretty short and to the point too so it wasn't hard to stay interested as it held a fairly consistent pace.I liked it. Good watch for a night on the couch.",Host
25,arungeorge13,A solidly made comp-screen film that gives you the chills! [+66%],7,1 August 2020,"Host doesn't try to reinvent the wheel but gives it a substantially solid upgrade. This is, for me, the most effective found-footage/screen-based horror movie since Unfriended. There isn't much in terms of character development or backstory but the narrative sets the ball rolling real quick - six friends get together on a Zoom call during the pandemic and invite a seventh guest to preside over a virtual seance. It's obvious that things don't pan out the way they expect.When you make a found footage movie based entirely on a video-conferencing app (Zoom, in this case) during a global pandemic, it hits you differently. Given a good part of the world has been completely indoors in the last few months and associate it with comfort and safety, breaking those walls down to bring effective scares really works like a charm. That you'll view the movie on the same laptop you use for a gazillion Zoom calls adds to the unnerving experience.The cast, while not A-listers, come up with solid efforts. The fear is palpable and their expressions compellingly convey the dread with each passing minute. The premise is quite basic but enhanced greatly by the application of neat visual effects. What's a downer here is that we've already seen most of these shaky camera scares in similar films and know what's coming every time a character investigates a thud or sees something murky. In that sense, Host is a not-bad but derivative effort.Host also comes with its share of unexpected humor in the form of grocery deliveries, sneezes, and pee-breaks. You'll also come across COVID-season-specifics such as wearing a mask while stepping out and characters giving each other an elbow bump. It also integrates the technicalities of Zoom such as creepy filters and call-end countdowns, However, if you ask what's the best thing about Host, I'd say the 56-minute runtime. Director Rob Savage delivers a succinct film that doesn't allow the tension to drop once it escalates. On that front, Host is worth checking out, especially if the found-footage genre interests you!",Host

27,Pumpkin_Man,You Can't Socially Distance From Evil!!!,10,6 September 2020,"I thought this movie was very well-made. It's really short, but it gets the job done. This film was made during the coronavirus pandemic of 2020. This almost feels like it could be a sequel to 'Unfriended' I thought the jump scares were really good. I had fun with it. The movie is about a group of women who are all on a Zoom call during the quarantine. They want to conduct a seance, but they never really explain why. They reach out to Seylan, who talks them through the seance and how it needs to be performed. One of the friends makes up a false dead soul, and something evil uses it as their way in. Will anyone survive? If you love horror, supernatural and tired of the lockdown, I highly recommend HOST!!!",Host

The hanged spirit in the attic and the one with herself walking behing all along while her head was being hit against the table was creepy. The chair moving around by itself, the footprints in the flour sprinkled on the floor, the outline of a ghost under a blanket thrown in the air, we saw it all but it was effectively creepy. The last scene was the best as Jemma got out of her home and went over Hakey after she has been dragged outside of her room. she found her in another room hiding. With the camera flash they moved step by step to leave the house. And the last shot was the photo of the demonic spirit. I loved it!",Host

Oh please don't let this catch on like lost footage films has. Please don't. Just when we were headed in the right direction with quality horror films like Mother, Witch, and Hereditary. Along comes this epitome of pure laziness and quick money grabs in film production . Oh, they went so cheap as to using a free account! Would the paid Zoom account make the film over budget? Did they even use a legitimate copy Adobe Premier Pro or was it made with iMovie on a iMac.Perhaps this film might have worked better if they hired teen actors instead of graduate students. Maybe they could have rewritten Scooby Doo CGI into the film?If you consider a horror movie night a good night watching a Zoom conference with silly grown women squealing at noises during a séance conducted over teleconference software, this might be your film.

40,SoumikBanerjee25,There are better iterations of a similar concept!,5,19 September 2020,"""Host"" is a befittingly acted new age horror that delivers credible scares but falters in other decisive aspects! An otherwise audacious attempt with afresh concept; still couldn't justify its true merit nonetheless.
They have tried to keep this as much short as possible. With only under an hour of runtime; it could probably be the shortest 'Feature Film' I have ever witnessed.
Despite the shorter runtime which is usually a positive thing; A constrained time limit restricted its full potential to flourish!
Having seen similar movies before such as 'Searching' & 'Unfriended'; I must admit this fails to impress on so many grounds.Shall we begin with the positives first?To start with, the scares are well put.
They genuinely makes you terrified about the situation the characters are in.
Performances are solid and convincing enough for us to engage with the flow!
The tension stays throughout the entirety and keeps you second guessing.Now the negatives...Due to its relatively shorter length, none of the characters got any chance to develop whatsoever!
The fondness, the chemistry inbetween felt irrelevant and disjointed.
Supposed supernatural happenings occur without any prior motives!
A baseless showcasing of horror that simply doesn't mean much. Albeit they scare you and that's admirable; but how did it come to its existence? Were there any strong reasons behind for which the characters faced their penultimate consequences?
So many doubts but a much needed explanation was never really there.
It's undoubtedly an ambitious project that done some things quite right which I indeed adore But having already seen better iterations; this just doesn't make the cut!",Host

44,johannes2000-1,"A small, but effective, cleverly made and original horror-movie.",9,18 February 2021,"Thumbs up to the makers for this effective and very up-to-date horror-movie. Not only did they incorporate in the story the current Covid-19 crisis, with the lock-down and the subsequent hype in the use of internet-meetings, which gave it all a very relevant feel; but they also made the stringent Covid-restrictions in which they had to operate while making the movie, cleverly work in favour of the story.It resulted in a fine and creepy movie, in which a spiritual séance through a Zoom video conference amongst a group of friends (what an original idea by the way!) goes terribly awry when some uncontrollable evil is summoned. Probably thanks to the limited length (hardly an hour) the different characters do not get much depth, but within the chosen form this didn't really bother me. My sole reservation, one that I often have with comparable found-footage movies, concerns characters who are supposed to be scared out of their wits and desperately try to escape some fatal threat, but in all this turmoil still are able to drag along their cameras, or in this case their laptops, so that we (the audience) still can see what happens. How realistic is that?! Anyway, this slight lack of logic didn't really spoil any of my fun.All in all: original, effective and very entertaining.",Host

47,baileycrawly,Formulaic,3,21 August 2020,"Host doesn't do it for me, which is a real shame because I wanted to love it.
It could've been a nice replacement for Unfriended, which is one of the better (albeit also very formulaic) horror films to come out in the last 10 years without the uncomfortable reality of profiting off bullying-related suicides looming over your head the whole time.
Instead, what you got was a horribly formulaic film that, while executed well in some respects, just doesn't hold up very well.
But it's always best to start with the positives.
The banter between the characters is believable, although it comes off as forced a little bit. They've definitely gone above and beyond to perfectly replicate the Zoom experience, down to the limitations of using a free account.However, the movie gets bad pretty quickly. It's boring; nothing of substance really happens and, when things finally do start to take off, it's exactly what you would expect from this kind of movie, practically down to every microscopic detail. Cheap jumpscares abound as a cop-out to avoid creating any real tension that pays off in a satisfying way. And the effects, when they were used (not mentioned in specifics due to spoilers) take you right out of the movie. They're goofy, cartoony and only scary because they're accompanied by loud noises and flashes of light. Mute the film and it'll offer you literally nothing. There's nothing scary or even remotely unnerving about this film.Even the message of the film is old, one that's been done a million times. Don't contact the spirit world, because things will go awry. Duh. I can't realistically imagine a respectable writer in the business who would still see that as a subject fit for exploration.

1. All of the actors have fantastic chemistry together, which they convey perfectly via their tones of voices and facial expressions, which allows their banter to feel really genuine.

3. The violence and gore, though brief, is visceral and brutal.
4. The jump-scares are well-timed and they send legitimate shivers down the spine.
5. There is brilliant usage of practical effects which create some memorable horror moments.
6. Caroline Ward (Caroline) and Emma Louise Webb (Emma) deliver very good performances.Cons:
1. The foreshadowing dialogue is obnoxious, annoying, and far too cheesy.
2. Why didn't Seylan (Seylan Baxter) get in contact with Haley (Haley Bishop) as soon as her internet cut out?

Although It is highly inventive, without a doubt, Host is one of the most uniquely ambitious horror movies to come along this year, It is just one unsurprising death after another. The entire picture takes place on one of the protagonist's laptop - is the only original thing going on.

59,TheCorniestLemur,Just watch Searching instead,1,19 January 2021,"I can't remember the last time I watched anything so relentlessly uninspired.I feel like I need to get something out of the way first: I am an enormous wuss. If I watch a horror film, even an utterly atrocious one like this, there's a better than average chance I will be tensed up, and that was the case with this one. However, that doesn't mean that I can't tell when it's this lazy, but if you're like me and just want to be scared for a little while, then go nuts.So with that out of the way, this is basically just Unfriended (an already garbage film) that at least doesn't waste as much of your time, but still has the most obnoxious sense of thinking it's so clever just because ""we filmed it on zoom"", and made a desperate (and oh boy do I mean desperate) attempt to feel relevant by throwing in a few lines referring to Covid, and frankly it was only just something you could call a new idea when Unfriended did it.In 2020, you can't just expect everyone to applaud you for making a whole film on video call that has nothing otherwise interesting about the presentation because it's just not new anymore. Every indie filmmaker, their mother, and their entire family tree is making films like this nowadays, and probably doing it better too.And hell, thinking about it, I'm pretty sure even Unfriended had a better presentation than this. At least in that film I felt like I was actually watching a Skype call for the most part, and the camera didn't just decide to switch to the most relevant character unless it was the protagonist doing it. At least the audio and video glitched out more than a handful of times, which almost anyone can tell you is just what happens with video chat after the year we just had, the sound in general is annoying, and why does everyone walk around with their laptop screens facing away from them??In fact, while I'm at it, why do any of these dumb characters do anything other than try and call the seance lady back or leave their houses? Why do they spend 15 minutes, or in other words, over a quarter of this entire film at the beginning wasting time making useless small talk?Why are the scares in this never any more imaginative than doors slamming, monsters screaming in your face, and lights flickering? I mean, come ON, that's barely even horror 101 anymore!The one thing I could maybe say in this film's favour is that the acting isn't bad, but even then, nearly all of it is whispered words of encouragement or sudden screaming, so you'll forgive me if I'm still not calling for any Oscars for this.I'm done talking about this rubbish now, I'm sick of having to think about it so I can write this, I'm sick of looking at its terrible poster. Screw this film, screw Shudder for letting it happen, screw the director for thinking that this was worth anyone's time, it's a piece of garbage, no one should support it, it might be worse than Artemis Fowl, it blows, it's the worst horror film of the year...and I don't like it.",Host

62,TuesdayThe17th,I'm hosting this one,6,7 August 2020,"-See bottom for update-ORIGINAL REVIEW:
From a seasoned found footage fan, the status and hype over this movie surprises me greatly. There are two obvious reasons this movie has done so well. Firstly, the movie lightly touches on the coronavirus epidemic. The characters are all on lockdown because of the virus which is why they are all communicating through skype. Though obvious, this is told through very minor and minimal references. Audiences widely will automatically be drawn to this storyline as we can all relate to this. Our lives have all been ravaged by the invisible threat and it is a passionate and sensitive topic for most of us.. This film was shot during the epidemic, but there are still far too little references to it rendering it nearly pointless and useless. The bigger and main reason this film did well is because it was released via Shudder, the horror and genre film platform. This is very fortunate for this movie because normally this is the type of found footage low budget schlock you'd find on amazon prime for free especially considering its confused runtime which never allows for a fully immersive experience. This movie is somewhere caught up in the confusion between a short and a feature film, and movies like this usually don't get seen by anyone except for true horror and film fans who dig this stuff up. Maybe found footage lovers like myself would seek this movie out if it were on amazon prime to watch on a Friday night but then would be taken aback by its runtime, thinking its not long enough for me n my girlfriend or my friends to settle into. So shudder GREATLY helped this film, if not entirely. So all in all this is clever promoting even if one dislikes the movie.
The film itself plays out over one single skype call similarly to ""Unfriended"" and ""E-Demon"". ""E-Demon is an example of basically the same exact storyline but is not released through shudder. ""E-Demon"" is unknown to most if not all and is no worse than ""Host"".
The scares you will find in ""Host"" are clever and for the most part effective which actually IS a bit rare in found footage the more these types of movies come out. There is a true terror held through out ""Host"" that lets up too soon. The part with the face filter was very scary and creative, however, the material isn't newly realized. Nonetheless, the horror and atmosphere is still tense and scary even with the overuse of jump scares and sudden loud sounds/bangs. So all in all this movie is pretty scary but not by any means is it scarier than many other amazon prime released found footage low budgeters. The all girl cast gets a little annoying for me as I think male characters tend to be more interesting in film. A much scarier movie is ""Murder Death Koreatown"". Both films are very low budget and belong in the same realm but ""Host"" doesn't even hold a candle to ""MDK""..Really this makes me sad to see the wrong films getting wide praise like this. What about the other 100 competitors creating better art than this? Still, ""Host"" is a decent found footage entry with some decent scares.UPDATE: I watched this movie again a few nights ago, and it was a little better this time around. I spent so much time on the negatives in my previous review so I decided I should shed some positive light on this film as well. Yes, ""HOST"" starts about as basic as they get but there are actually a few positive mentionable moments that come later in the film. This movie has something other found footage movies don't in terms of scares. Most found footage films end up showing very little through the lens whether it be due to the plot being shrouded in mystery or just the poor use of lackluster effects and camera work. This movie actually has some scares that we can clearly see and they are physical. By this I mean it looks like we can reach out and touch them with out reaching through them or the camera jetting away too soon. The ghost character that is revealed in the final 10 minutes of the movie is clearly seen and this is done effectively well. The way the movie ends reminds me.of another found footage film that is better than this movie called ""Ghoul"" What this movie lacks however is a real sense of atmosphere though out. The parts of walking through the hallway im the dark should have been creepier. The characters should have walked slower. If this movie had a rich found footage atmosphere with a louder noise interference it would have been epically scary. The atmosphere isn't nonexistent but its very minimal and it doesn't really vamp up in the most critical times. So ultimately once you get past the basic set up.and premise there are some nice scares littered through out. The face filter is also pretty scary but again, the scene felt too rushed. In a movie like this, patience and atmosphere are key! Still a respectable true found footage horror movie like they used to make em",Host

I have watched quite a few films like this such as Cam, Unfriended and Dark Web. These have all been enjoyable and varied in good and bad parts of the film.
Now this film had air of things happening in it for the running time it had, just under an hour and that my friends is the only bad thing about this film.
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON FOR LONGER.

65,manuelasaez,Paranormal ZOOM activity,3,2 August 2020,"If you've ever seen any found-footage movie, a demonic possession movie, or a movie about seances and the occult, you've already seen this movie. It does nothing new or even in a clever way, and relies on loud noises and jump scares to accomplish what a better movie would have done through creativity. The people who made this thought that they were being clever by making an hour long horror movie using Zoom, but what kind of idiot does a seance online? I mean, really. It's asinine, and just a little bit....lame?The story had been done to DEATH, the characters were all annoying and super unlikable (especially the lead actress), and the movie has been done better by much more talented people. If you can watch this movie for free, you could do worse. But anyone with standards would pass this up as it was obviously made for teenagers.As a side note, the COVID ""social distancing"" aspect was stupid, and I watch movies to escape reality, not be reminded of it. You have a girl break quarantine running down the street with a mask half off her face entering someone else's home and greeting her with an elbow, because god forbid two uninfected people might pass something to each other. Absolutely ridiculous.",Host

67,FKDZ,A surprisingly tense short film,8,1 August 2021,"I got to say, for how short it is I expected less but this delivered and was spot on for me. It does exactly what it needs to do without excessive fluff. The acting that supports the plot really makes this movie. All the characters were believable and you really get a little pulled in their friend group. And once you're comfortable within the group, like you are in on the call yourself. It gets good.The movie is a bit contemporary, video calls will stay for a while but the movie would've been a bit more timeless without any pandemic references. It does feel more real now. But its going to be annoying once its in the past.The sounddesign is done with great care here. I loved it, and I really recommend some good headphones or sound system to get fully immersed. Because if its one thing you want to be its immersed.I could see how you'd dislike the movie a lot if you can't place yourself in that zoom call. So really, watch it in a dark room, and focus on it.Regarding scariness, I tend to be more scared of paranormal stuff so this was a good one for me. There's lots of it. And there are some shocking visuals but none that are too bad.If anything is a testament to the movie I felt relieved once it was over, like all the tension left my body. It plays into so many relatable things, simple homes, normal people, people's fear of going into the dark/unknown. It's great. Regarding predictability its also good, after seeing a ton of horror, you can easily predict scares, but they really play around with the timing here.So for me, a solid 8/10. Watch this as if you're in the zoom call with them!",Host

70,babyjaguar,"Host: Influences from DIY, Found-footage, Mumblecore, etc. with Social Distancing?",5,4 August 2020,"Savage's Host, comes in the time of social distancing where low production companies now facing a challenge of the ""new normal"". One can say that the Unfriended (2014) or even Grave Encounters (2011-2012) and the Gallows series is an influence. But there are genres and particular pioneering films that initially fused the internet, found footage, social media with the supernatural.But within the millennial cinema of the supernatural and the internet: one needs to give credit to the Blair Witch Project (1999-2000). Yes, it's considered found footage genre and a mockumentary but it used the internet to gather its story (doubling as premarket tool for the film releasing) unlike Paranormal Activity (2007) initiated on the premise of found-footage then with REC's (2007) live-footage horror.The possible inspirational roots for Host could be most likely Joe Swanberg's segment in V/H/S (2012) using then video chat room with the supernatural, many refer this segment to ""mumblecore"" genre (although it's a rejected term) and the webisode series, The 15 Experience (think of the infamous make-up tutorial segment). The length of Host (56 mins) works fine, since it's supposed to be a Zoom session, that usually cut offs may within an hour.Many late Millennial/Gen Z viewers probably unknown to the aforementioned genres, may view this feature as pioneering and fresh. Even though this just a revisit (but in the process), it intersects past genres. Considering the challenges that directors face during the Co-vid era, Host proves to make horror and suspense still present offline and online.I highly recommend viewing this film on mobile or tablet device, it's appropriate... it builds up the suspense.",Host
71,nashw82,Short and Simple but Solid,8,27 November 2020,"This short, taut, little horror movie is nothing new. It plays with all the horror tropes we know so well. But it benefits from being timely, gripping and very well made.
It is effectively a found footage supernatural horror movie set on zoom, but it was made in the year that almost every man, woman and child was stuck using zoom for everything from business meetings and school classes to thanksgiving dinners and romantic dates.
A group of friends meet on zoom for a catchup, and more importantly to hold a seance. When certain members of the group don't take things seriously things escalate quite quickly.
And quick is a keyword here, taking advantage of the new possibilities of streaming platform, this ""feature film"" is finished in over in less than an hour. And it was a really smart call, where other such films bring in explanations or exposition for stretch out the usual found footages concepts, this one does everything you need and then finished before you get bored with it. They still manage to develop the characters okay, but purely through their interactions rather than any additional exposition, an it's enough to give you a good feel for their personalities and relationships.
Definitely worth a watch, especially while many of us are still in lockdown, and at less than an hour, even if it doesn't match the hype, you really won't be too disappointed.
If you're really brave, try watching it alone on a laptop with headphones in a dark room haha. Press play and have fun!~",Host

77,BeanieCore,"Been there, done that.",4,23 March 2021,"This is the first horror film to be shot completely during quarantine, fittingly taking place over a Zoom call. But I'm having a very hard time understanding the positive reception to it thus far. It's barely a feature length film, only padding out to 54 minutes long, and though it gets to the action fairly quickly, there's nothing the least bit memorable about it. Instead of opting for an original premise it's happy to re-hash POV horror clichés. Forget the pointlessness of why this group of friends decided to randomly have a séance over a Zoom call during lockdown. There's obviously no time for character development either, but this could've been forgiven had the film tread some new ground. Instead, literally every image here is copied from some other supernatural horror flick of the past ten years. I literally can't think of a moment here that is not a shameful replication of something else I'd seen almost shot for shot in a better film. Really, even the premise of ""desktop horror"" was already done better by both ""Unfriended"" films, and elevated further by ""Searching"". Top that junk sundae off with the fact that the only ""scares"" here are noisy, predictable jump-scares, and this is just a poor film all around. The only thing I can say in it's favor is that the cast was quite good. But if it weren't for it's being released under these circumstances, this clunker would've faded into obscurity.",Host

Six friends hold a seance on a zoom call, then everything goes to sheet. all the characters of this movie are cliché horror characters but in a hour you're not going to really care or root for any except for being scared for them ok a human level. It is acted incredibly well for a horror movie and that's really all that matters to make you believe into the plot.A must watch horror in this quarantine.

These movies at more than an hour tend to drag and you lose the fun of the experience. This is quite a jam packed 56 minutes.They made this during quarantine so there is a few clever nods to the pandemic. 1 of them was too much for me tho. One lady gets scared to death in a scene and decide to run out of her house. Scared to death she still takes the time to put on a mask...at night...when no one is around... i raised my eyebrow there. (Edit : I'm not anti mask at all but in the same situation i would have noped out of the house so quick without thinking one second about stopping to be sure to wear a face mask)I wanted to give it an 8 but the last shot of the movie was so cliché horror trope that it almost ruined it for me i genuinely went ""Oh come on!"". If the movie was not really excellent for 55 minutes i would have been pissed but it's very good. Very tropey last shot.The acting was excellent for some parts i forgot i was watching a movie it seemed super real the interactions between the characters. None of the girls did a bad job.

But not in these. It's so terrifying, yet they keep filming. It's so painfully dumb.The premise is also just as dumb. During a séance on zoom, one person fakes a ghost and somehow that opens the door for a real demon, of course, forgetting that every séance anyone has for fun or real always has one or more people doing this.Then we get the same stuff from Paranormal Activity, almost totally ripped off.The worst thing is this is just under an hour but the first 20 minutes is these people talking. Maybe interesting if you're a 13 year old girl, but an adult is going ""please, for the love of God just kill me.""Also if you get a chance, freeze frame on the very last demon.

Now I do believe in supernatural elements; they are energies (positive or negative). This movie shows how dangerous it is to enter the other dimension. The girls except Haley were so disrespectful to the psychic as well as the session. Holding the laptop and running behind the voices looked stupid and not practical. Just imagine you are conducting a virtual seance. If you hear a noise, wont you just run out of the house or call someone???? But the scary moments especially the last scene made me scream.

There was a few good creepy bits but for me not to scary but I did grow up in a genuine haunted house so maybe I am harder to scare.This is certainly worth a watch and a great idea for a movie to be made in lockdown.

Pretty clever idea actually given this years events. Far better than the un scary big budget horror let downs lately. Was obviously filmed during lockdown with minimal crew.Not sure what the low reviewers were expecting. Maybe big budget with violence and gore?

104,cristinalinderman,An intense heart-pounding horror film.,8,2 August 2020,"* There is no end credit scene *The director Rob Savage and crew brought an intense heart-pounding horror film. The story sets when six friends and a medium hold a séance via Zoom due to the quarantine. I love horror films set in found-footage technique and in this case a computer screen film. I thought it was going to be the same level as Unfriended (2014) but it wasn't, it surpasses immensely the intensity and also with a better captivating story. Once my heart started pounding it never stopped, and I wanted more of this kind of fright. This film needs to be watched at night to be able to experience a complete horror atmosphere and if you are desperate to watch and it still not dark then I recommend going to your room and shut everything, do not even let a single light in. How I loved it touched the theme of taking a séance seriously and the consequences of making jokes out of things one doesn't understand.The narrative has a great structure giving the right amount of character introduction without focusing on it making it feel a real-life session and the cast performance was solid. This technique always sets a known conclusion that is why the main center is the unfolding fear in which creeps one surrounding and it truly delivers.",Host
105,actaction,"Unbelievable, but wants to be",5,30 August 2020,"While I think it's cool the film was made during the pandemic lockdown, there were times when the pandemic got in the way of the believability. One character is scared for her and her friend's life and runs outside, but remembers her mask. If you are aware suddenly of a demon you don't go back for your mask. This was an example of a couple of details that didn't work so well. The person running outside for a moment without a mask would have been safe to get the shot. The pacing is really slow, the first twenty minutes follows the paranormal activity cliche of things being calm and non-scary for a very long time until stuff starts going wrong. I will give the film credit for slowly ratcheting up there tension, the person's feet hanging was especially creepy and the background zoom effect coming in and out was inventive. Ultimately, it's worth a watch, but it fails to be especially memorable. The characters are a bit dull and the story ultimately is a bit thin making it feel long.",Host

Most of the elements we've seen before, but the creator wanted to get a story in first using lockdown experiences & for once someone got it right. I for one have never seen or used Zoom, but I completely got it & I knew what was happening, the script & performances were totally natural & very realistic & I was taken in very quickly.The only plot point I questioned was the speed & seriousness things started to happen, I thought, they hardly did anything, but this was explained by the psychic & at under an hour, there's no time to waste! With a special mention for the effects, they were excellent, effective & didn't look cheap.New, unusual, effective, creepy & yes scary, this effort is to be commended; I guess there is something about Zoom scarier than the Chinese ;-).",Host

I hope we get more. So clever.",Host

This movie was filmed during the lockdown because of the coronavirus . Although it takes half the movie to get to the scary parts ""Host"" keeps on the edge of your seat for the WHOLE movie . The acting is on point , the movie is awfully well made but it lacks in some parts . The main problem is the lack of originality it feels like a better version of unfriended . The ending was predictable . I didn't mind that much though because the movie features some of the most scary jumpscares i have EVER seen. My rating is 8/10 go watch this film if you want to get scared take some popcorn call some friends and have fun",Host
112,xrionitx,Scary but too short,5,10 August 2020,"The movie / short film was pretty good and scary.. But the only biggest disappointment was its short length.. and everything just came up too quick and rapid. This is really a downgrade for film industry to gradually reduce the film length day by day..This length cutting in the name of liberal people's choices, and their busy schedule, and they demand less screen time is ruining the film making.. This has to come under short film category. If this less run time keeps going then that day is not far that the films will be 5 to 10 mins in length, because liberals have less time.....",Host
113,its-me6611,What a fantastic horror film.,9,8 August 2020,9/10Six friends hire a medium to hold a seance via Zoom. One of the friends unintentionally sends an open invitation to the astral plane and something evil accepts her invitation.Very short run time. The story actually starts 10min into the film and those first 10min can be fast forwarded. The story is simple. The acting is very good but what stands out is the scariness of the film. There were multiple times I had to cover my eyes partially with an anticipation of a jump scare. The only negative is that one character handled the camera poorly that could have been easily avoided.If you don't mind shaky camera work or jump scares this will be a wonderful experience. I am so glad I gave Host (2020) a chance. I cannot recall the last time I had this much fun with a horror film. A truly scary film.,Host

I can honestly say one thing though I'd never do one myself no way. The set up of this short horror all on zoom in different houses plus they didn't really do it right it felt rushed but overall good and creepy in be letting my girlfriend watch this one by herself one night.",Host

117,Victor_Fallon,Horror movie for people who... I dunno. I just don't know.,1,10 September 2020,"For a modern film in the 'jumpscare' sub-genre, it is amazing that all of the scares are the same tired cliches. Sometimes the same gag is employed in back-to-back scenes. Baffling.We are introduced to a group of friends in a Zoom call, all of 'em forgettable non-characters. They're just there. They engage in a seance (there is no artistry to this - it is them literally asking 'is there anybody there' next to a candle) and then a demon shows up. Any questions this may raise go unanswered. A spooky spook is gonna get 'em. That's it. I could forgive this extreme streamlining of plot, narrative, character and story if we were taken on a rollercoaster ride. But no. It's slow and often tedious. Not even the short runtime can hide this fact. Very little happens and when it does, you've seen it before.I'm not impressed by loud noises and 2-frame inserts of 'scary' faces. Horror is a genre with so much to offer. This sort of movie makes me wonder if the filmmakers actually like horror. I doubt it. I think this was made for cynical reasons. Nobody was burning to tell this story.The production is poor, which can be forgiven for the lockdown circumstances in which it was made, but that means we also lose out on costume, lighting, set design, score, etc. The writing is too scant to even criticize. The acting is barely present, with the exception of Seylan Baxter as the medium, who is the only actor that manages to present herself like a real person. She's good, and represents my one star.",Host

122,FridayElmStreet,Flawed but Very Scary,6,25 February 2021,"I must say Host is probably the scariest film I have seen in a while. The film works well for the most part. The film is about in modern day Civid-19 quarantine, 6 friends get together in a zoom chat to have a séance. One of the friends ruins everything and basically they get haunted. There are some good scares here. One really got to me and I yelled out loud.for the most part I recommend Host as a solid scary film but there is one thing that is a major flaw. The film only has a run time of 57 minutes. Thats fine with me really. Rather have a shorter film without the filler. But what happens is t boost the run time up someone thought it was a good idea to put a real life séance that the cast and crew did at the end of the film. It really brings you out of the film you just watched. Its just a DVD feature attached to the film. Im guessing its just to boost the run time up. But the extra bit is not scary and feels like a useless extra. It just kinds ruined the whole good scary experience for me.",Host
123,jwcstorage,You've seen this movie before,2,3 October 2020,"You've seen this movie before, and yes it is exactly what you expect.Cast: Jemma was very annoying, but the rest of the cast were mostly fine.Plot: They summon spooky scary stuff. OooOOoOoOo OOoOoooOo.
Actual Plot: A lot of darkness, a lot of jumpscares and invisible threats.
Ending: A jump scare. Just like the rest of these movies. Completely pointless.I saw that this horror movie floated under my radar. Excitedly I gave it a watch, and unfortunately. This movie is literally every other low budget teen-scarefest. If jumpscares and invisible monsters dont scare you, give this movie a HUGE PASS.
While it is rather short, even for a horror film, geez did it feel like it was 12 hours long.
Also, the characters dont really act like real people. If something invisible literally drags/throws you across a room, your instincts wouldnt be to just stay there, and get back to your position on your computer/phone. No one calls for REAL help (the police) or even friends/neighbors. Jemma literally says in the beginning of the movie that she can hear her neighbors! Yet all of her yelps and screams dont get their attention, nor does she yell for help, try to go to her neighbors apartment. No, they all just sit in their rooms (for the most part) while letting an unknown entity toss them around while wimpering.BIG SPOILER: The 'demon' is a guy with no shirt on, curly brown hair, a missing nose and F'd up mouth. I paused to check out the final jump scare and it was literally the least scary thing. Oh, he also had white eyes. Ooooooo spooky.
For some reason, he also seems to be radioactive? As you hear Geiger counter sounds whenever hes gonna show up.Nothing is explained. Nothing is resolved. Nothing but jump scares.This movie does not deserve your time.
You deserve better.",Host
124,craigwashington-30200,Very impressive,8,18 September 2020,I wasnt expecting much from such a short film but damn did it deliver. This is one of the best found footage horrors i have seen since the den. the last 15 mins was a roller coaster ride. Bravo to the director,Host
125,e-1529,Nothing too impressive,4,4 October 2020,"I don't really have anything against this movie, but it's very average and I watched it because of the good ratings which are not realistic. This is more of a 5.3 kind of movie. There's no build up to the point when things start going wrong, except 20 min of people talking over each other and munching words (don't they teach at british acting classes to enunciate?). The summoning of the evil spirit lasts like 1 minute, if you blink you miss it. After that it's a lot of cheap scares. Some are well done but still predictable. The last scare is the exact copy of a scene from the first Saw movie when Adam uses the flash camera to see in the dark.
After watching Host I thought that maybe I didn't like it because I'm not into paranormal movies but then I remembered I do occasionally enjoy some paranormal horror when it's classy and well done, like the Conjuring or Paranormal Activity. All in all, I wouldn't recommend this movie, but if you have an hour to spare and you're bored, give it a go, there's worse than this out there.",Host

127,MacArthur_Parker,Perhaps its only saving grace is its runtime,2,31 December 2020,"In 2020, the found footage genre is tired, and screen horror is far from new. Films like Unfriended, Unfriended: Dark Web, a number of not as known ones, and, easily the best, Searching, have cropped up in recent years as it's is cheap and profitable. In the time of COVID, it's pretty much the way to go.A group of friends - presumably in their 20s - gather over Zoom to do a séance. The host, Haley, knows a medium, Seylan, to guide them. As expected, hijinks ensue.The cast give good performances, seeing what they're handed, and the blood effects are worth praise. However, the film's overreliance on jump scares will not affect anyone who's seen one of these before. The only real upside I can give is that it's only 56 minutes, but even that feels a bit of a chore.",Host
128,RudeArtAndDesign_Com,Genuine creativity in the time of covid,8,24 August 2020,"OK yeah it's a fun little horror flick but, I admit it probably doesn't deserve an '8' rating. However, I'm awarding an 'originality bonus point', one up from the seven I was going to give it.Why?Nothing to do with the actual movie itself. Though as found footage style horror movies go, this is near the top of any of the ones I've seen lately. If you're a real horror fan, you know scary things that go bump in the night style (not the torture porn variety of horror) you're probably gonna enjoy this.So why the bonus point. Because of the extra creativity in writing a movie that:
For one uses our current corona virus situation and writes it into the plot without having it dominate the story. It's just a matter of fact life situation we all have to live with. Who here hasn't had a zoom meeting (or drinking session) with friends during the covid lockdown?
And secondly, since movie and TV production across the globe is pretty much on hold due to the corona virus, the people that made this movie had to get really creative. How can you possibly get your entire cast of characters together on screen at the same time when you legally can't even get them together in the same room? Easy, if you've got a great idea. I think these people had a great idea and worked it perfectly considering the work constraints placed upon them with the mandatory social distancing and quarantine rules.So long story short a really good little indie horror flick made just a little bit better... thanks to the corona virus.",Host

This movie has such great scares and the acting is so real and terrifying. I do like how the movie is relatively fast paced due to the 57 minute runtime, but I do think the movie would have benefited a little more if it had just 10 more minutes of insane horror happening so it could pass the 1 hour mark.

Computer screen and paranormal entity movies aren't new stuff. Host is still special, because it is actually hella effective and well-made.We join the meeting of five women, Haley, Jemma, Emma, Caroline and Radina (also a man Teddy). They host a seance and as you may have guessed, weird things like banging doors happen, except it's on Zoom.The presentation of Host reminds me of Unfriended and Searching, one of my favourites. The scares remind me of Unfriended (again) and the Paranormal Activity series. The concept reminds me of a dozen of other horror flicks.It may be nothing new in Host, but it's presented in such an effective and entertaining way that this film has its own charm. All the actors are really good in the movie. So are the direction and visuals.I really don't mind we keep getting horror movies with overused concepts, as long as the quality is as good as this film.

However, due to them not taking their supernatural endeavour seriously, a more malevolent force enters the picture and begins picking them off one by one. Think Unfriended, but a bit more concise and British.Considering it was made under the restrictions of Lockdown, you can't deny it's a little impressive and while it's ""web-call haunting"" premise isn't entirely original, it's incorporation if Zoom helps it become a bit more relatable. There's not much room to make any performance shine, but all the acting's okay for the most part. The character's are also decent, I really didn't like Jemma, but I don't think you're supposed to.The jump-scares are kind of annoying and I think the film would've been better off with just the one, but there general execution's still effective.

145,cockadoody73,Very pleasantly surprised.,8,6 August 2020,"I'd seen recommendations for this movie (does 56 minutes qualify it as a movie?) in a couple of online horror groups, it was pretty much unanimously liked by all who had seen it.It's a pretty simple premise - 6 friends in Covid19 lockdown having a Zoom chat (think Unfriended), something which a great many of us did. Difference is they've hired a psychic to conduct a seance with them. They giggle about how it's not real, mock the paranormal, then admit the psychic to the chat.
From there on in it's a pretty creepy movie, quite a few jump scares, some very irritating actors (the one male friend and the girl named Jemma are just awful) and quite a few 'nods' to Paranormal Activity, The Blair Witch Project and REC (look for the camera in the loft scene and you'll see what I mean), as whatever has been invited in via Jemma's stupidity begins to seek out the participants one by one.
It starts with little scares then builds to some pretty good jump scares.It's not big budget, it's not the best horror movie ever, it's not even top 100, but it's pretty good considering that it was filmed whilst the actors were actually locked down.
Considering I was expecting another predictable horror I was genuinely surprised at how good it is.",Host

The gimmick has lost all effectiveness for me.Don't get me wrong, I'm impressed with how effective you can make a horror movie these days on a shoe-string budget, and Host makes the magic happen about as efficiently as possible.On a personal level though, this just gets added to the multitude of other found-footage films that I've seen over the last couple decades, that will soon be forgotten and likely never be thought of again.",Host

The duration is a very big plus. About 1 hour. The starting of the film was slightly a lag (conversations) but that is not a problem. If we say the editor to cut the film more then the editor will probably be pissed off. The jump scares in the movie could be lot more!

This film is a good advertisement for the zoom videoconferencing system because everything else is too bad. I wasted my time although I was curious to see where this would take us, nothing new.

154,morbidlove21,Surprisingly Good,9,31 July 2020,"I didn't think I'd like this movie as much as I did. I figured it'd be another low budget horror film with terrible events befalling the main characters for not taking their situation seriously. While that's kind of what this is, the difference is that the acting is well done, and you get to see the characters interact a bit before the creepy things begin to happen.The use of Zoom was a fun touch because it's relevant for the current time, the pandemic really is going on, and with Zoom you have creative backgrounds you can use and time limits for the meetings. All of that worked really well for some of the scares. While you don't get a ton of character backstory, you don't really need it in a 56 minute movie.The shorter run time helps this movie to avoid some of the tropes similar films have suffered from... there isn't needless fighting, the story doesn't revolve around predictable jump scares or irrelevant storylines to pad the runtime.Haley gets a group of friends together on Zoom to work with a medium to contact spirits. Jemma doesn't take it seriously and pretends to be contacted by a dead friend. Because she made this up, she inadvertently invited a demonic entity into their session, one that proceeds to target each person on the meeting until no one is left. Just when they think they've properly broken the circle and saved themselves, they find out how wrong they are and that none of them can run or hide from the demonic presence.Well done and worth a watch!",Host
155,Brandon_Walker_Robinson,"Despite my personal bias, I was still a big fan of this.",6,30 July 2020,"I want to get this out of the way: I am a friend of Haley Bishop's (who plays Haley, the lead and the host of the Zoom call). We met in college and lived in the same dorm, so we got close. I remember her as a good singer at the time, and since then I started to know her as a good up-and-coming actress. I have been supporting her as she's getting more roles, so when I first learned that she was in Host, I knew I had to check it out ASAP.Anyway, onto the film that I would coin as ""Paranormal Activity meets Unfriended meets quarantine"" (not Quarantine the movie, but our current situation heh). This 56-minute Shudder original production plays succinctly, and this becomes an advantage for the film's story structure. It might have helped because I'm personally connected with Haley, but because she was essentially playing ""herself"" I was easily able to connect with the other members in the Zoom call, seeing them as ""her friends."" I didn't need massive amounts of character introduction, and they were able to naturally develop and distinguish themselves in quick and short order. They don't feel like campy horror movie characters, they just felt like people. It made it feel really easy to be involved in the session.The timing of this film is also noteworthy, and in my opinion it is most important that people who CAN watch it now are also able to. This flick is focused around a seance through online chat because they are quarantined. This is our lives right now, and this is the kind of way that something like this would and should have to occur. We aren't a stranger to the elements that the writers and director of Host wanted to convey most strongly. This helps brings a little bit more charm for us who are all feeling a bit insane during these times. This time, watch others live it for a little while, and watch terror occur in the process! Heh.The audience members who were critical of Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk had fits partly with the lack of girth that could have been used to build the characters and story. In a similar sense, Host wastes no time giving you the characters, perhaps a foreshadowing item or two that you expect to arise later, and won't answer every question that you might have about what you see on screen. To this, I say that is completely fine. They work hard on giving you less and leaving you wanting more, and honestly the movie is better because of it. David Sandberg's short film version of Lights Out was impeccably creepier than its full-length feature film because they didn't try to provide exposition and background to everything, and this movie is like that but with a lot of character interaction in the process. I don't feel you'll be disappointed in this regard if you understand this intent.This is well acted by all parties involved. What was nice is even if the movie might not necessarily scare you in itself (depending on who you are), the way that the actors convey fear when appropriate (as you'll also get bouts of denial and ignorance) makes you frightful as they are. Unlike Unfriended, this feels a lot less ""produced,"" and that's a good thing, because I feel like Haley and the other actors could really play this in as few takes as possible, and even improvise when needed. There is at least one part that they had to play off an unintended mishap, and it was left in the movie not as a gag reel highlight, but rather as a happy accident.I started playing this at 2:00 AM, knowing that I wouldn't be able to stay awake even an hour longer and I'd finish it the next day. Come 3:00 AM, I'm at the credits and wondering how I'm tenfold more awake than I was when I started the movie. It never really lets you breathe too much to say what a good stopping point would be if needed, and that's kind of a cool facet that many other films aren't able to have as often. It doesn't really play in ""scenes,"" it's simply a ""session"" and I loved it for that.Anyway, I will completely acknowledge my bias here, but I like that it did the screencasting found footage format differently, specifically by trimming the fat of the run time. It really worked in its own favor. If people here haven't seen Searching, you'll get another different take on what this format has to offer and excels as well (given that it takes more than one kind of source, has a soundtrack, zooms on parts of the screen, etc.), so it just goes to show that this format can work in a lot of different ways and still be successful in the process. Again, this helps for the times that we live in right now, and I highly commend them for executing it well on top of it.If you're not a fan of Unfriended and Paranormal Activity, this MAY not be for you. However, if this review gives you slight hope of optimism, you have an hour to spare, and you would like to support my friend in the process, please hop onto Shudder and give this a looksie!",Host

Thankfully the movie surpassed my expectations. It's not the best horror movie ever made but it is a very fun and mindless horror movie if you have an hour to spare. It's almost short enough to give an anthology type vibe. Like I could almost see this movie being a good fit for a VHS 4 ( if they ever make one and if it doesn't suck like the third VHS did) if it were just a bit shorter. If you're gonna watch this then I'd suggest going in with low expectations and watch it just to see some creepy horror scenes. 6.2/10 rating from me.,Host

Also, the budget had to have been relatively decent because the special effects are on par with movies like Paranormal Activity. I actually wasn't going to watch this is. I thought it was bizarre that the running time is less than an hour. It makes sense now. Most movies need a fair amount of time to build-up the characters and where the movie is heading. This movie is straight to the point, so there is no need. Just a group of friends on Zoom in the middle of our pandemic. In terms of anything negative to say, I literally can't. Anyone who loves found footage horror knows how hit and (mostly) miss the genre is. This is a diamond. I loved this movie and scrutinizing something good for negatives is just not my vibe. 2nd best Found Footage movie I've seen this year behind ""The Lost Footage of Leah Sullivan"".",Host

Host had all of the elements that make a pretty decent scare fest. No, it wasnt perfect and some things were predictable and we've seen a few of them before. But those same scenes we've seen before somehow felt fresh here and the performances felt spot on. The entire premise was really cool and unique and engaging.

The entire zoom concept was nice and interesting, which makes this stand apart from other session based or found footage movies.
All the lead characters portrayal was great and the casting was aptly done. All the vfx shots was pretty much credible and gives genuine scare.
Though initial few moments dragged a bit, it was for the ambience to keep us hooked. Once in, it was dark and ominous then.

The climax however kinda let it down with an overreliance on jump scares. It wasn't too bad, but a bit more slow building horror and a few fewer jump scares would have improved things.That said, despite the overreliance on jump scares it actually got me a few times despite watching it in a well lit room.One thing however that kinda broke my immersion was the characters observing masking and social distancing rules while they are being terrorized by an evil spirit.

196,michelleseashell-98652,"Watchable, but a little overrated.",4,18 January 2021,"This was alright. Not brilliant. But alright.I was hearing a lot of rave reviews about this. Honestly, I think this is due to someone spotting a gap left by covid-19 that meant many films couldn't go to production this past year. This would explain it's popularity, though I am surprised people consider it an original concept, when it's basically a British, dare I say amateurish, version of Unfriended. I would expect to see this on youtube, rather than Shudder.I am sort of familiar with some of Jed Shepherd's past work. Dawn of the Deaf was quite a good short film of his, so I hoped for more of the same. However, I am not fond of his podcasts on various subjects and find him to be a teeeeeensy bit smug. Having said that, his co-hosts are just insufferable, so he is probably the better feature on said podcasts. So on balance, I came to this fairly unbiased.One part of Host I did like was the fact that all of the cast were at least in their 30's, if not their 40's (and the psychic who must be at least 50's) which is a daring move to take, but a welcome one. There's only so many times that I can stomach a bunch of squealing and overly dramatic teens and twenty somethings. So the older cast were more palatable in that respect. However, they were sadly not all particularly good at acting. I would say the two stand-outs were the psychic lady, for her really natural and believable performance as one of those dreadful psychic-types that you just instantly recognise and Caroline, who was able to switch emotions convincingly and they didn't appear forced, unlike the others.I thought the filters that kept coming on unexpectedly on the woman with pigtails (ugh - please, no pigtails beyond primary school!) were a pretty funny addition and hope that was intended to be funny rather than scary, as it earns the makers credit. Sort of managed to take away focus from the mediocre performance that particular actress was giving, so that was definitely a highlight.I would've suggested a creepy touch would've been to have Caroline's background of herself walking in and out of her room suddenly change and her counterpart do something of it's own accord, but maybe it wouldn't have fitted well.Overall it was watchable. Would I watch it again? Probably not? Would I recommend it to a friend? I doubt it, unless they were big into found footage horror and were looking for something they hadn't seen yet. Would I want it erased from existence? No. Would I angrily protest if someone wanted to watch it at a gathering? No. Like I said, it was alright.",Host

I don't think I could have asked for more from the first horror movie of the pandemic age. This movie couldn't exist at any other time, and will probably seem horribly dated a few years from now, but this hits the spot for pop culture as a reflection of its time. There are the jump scares you expect, but they seem to set up the unexpected shockers, and there are plenty of those. The short run time makes it accessible for multiple viewings. Watch it first for the story, and again for ""how did they do that?"" This is a movie of its time in its time; all the actors were socially distant, and there were no gaffers, or script girls, or sets. The actors had to film themselves. For a short, pandemic era film, the scares deliver. Check it out!",Host
202,ez_magdales,HAVE I SEEN THIS LIVE ZOOM BEFORE?,5,6 March 2021,"No offense but I somewhat feel some cliché vibe from the movie. It feels like the ""Unfriended"" movie but in a lockdown version. The whole plot is about 5 girls and an extra guy who's named Teddy doing a seance. For me, it was honestly predictable that these characters are going to experience some paranormal activity knowing that Teddy was just extra and Jemma pranking about some spooky tension. But knowing this is a quarantine-horror situation, it's still cool and professional from the fact that it's a low-budget film. The jumpscares weren't that scary. In a stereotypical horror movie, the characters notice some suspicious, ghostly moment and they try to investigate it and obviously a scary scene will pop out. I didn't get the ending though, did the ""Tom And Jerry"" characters (Haley and Jemma) reconcile and survive? Or did they die and left the movie with no surviving characters? Lastly, the post-credit scene with the actual seance is kinda unnecessary but I guess it's to lengthen the movie. Enough with the criticisms, the cast were great in staying to their character. I don't know how they filmed it but it did look like a live, one take zoom. Every death and horror scene is the best thing I liked throughout the movie. Overall, it's ok. But knowing it's short and low-budget, it's very good.",Host
203,nickmrkonja,EXCELLENT!!!,10,3 December 2020,"There are plenty of horror films that have scary PARTS in them. And there are a good number that are unsettling or disturbing for most of the movie. But Host is honestly the first horror movie I've seen in almost 30 years that was actually SCARY from the moment the ""action"" started up until the very end. Not since I watched the original Night of the Living Dead when I was 6... my very first horror film and still my absolute favorite... have I seen a horror movie that was perfect as far as what horror movies are supposed to be.It was a premise that's been in hundreds, if not over a thousand, horror movies... an unseen ghost or demon or entity terrorizing a group of people, so nothing new there. But it was HOW they presented a familiar premise that made it so great. The movie being presented as though you're watching the actual events on a computer screen does a perfect job of making you feel as though you're a part of the story, watching the events transpire in real time. No time lapses or cut scenes, it's one big, long event that you watch play out from start to finish. And what really sets this apart from the 30 other horror movies released each year is the absolutely PERFECT and effective use of tension, atmosphere, and palpable, believable fear from the characters. The casting was so well done because they all interact so naturally, it doesn't even come off as acting.Some people might be put off by the relatively short run time of about 56 minutes (which is probably slightly less when you account for beginning and ending credits)... I usually don't find short movies to even be worth it, and I may have passed this one up if I had seen that prior to watching it the first time... but I have to say, this movie did such an amazing job of sucking me in and keeping me immersed in what was happening, I didn't notice even AFTER it was over. It wasn't until the second time that I saw the runtime before putting it on.As I'm thinking about how to compare this horror flick to others I've seen, it really occurred to me that after 30 years and literally hundreds of horror movies that I love so much, this one is without a doubt my second favorite horror movie EVER. My #1 will always be Night because it's total horror perfection for so so many reasons, but Host has beat out countless other favorites (Alien, The Shining, It Follows, As Above So Below, Texas Chainsaw) just for the simple fact that it scared me to the point that, at 35 years old, I had to sleep with the lights on for the first time since seeing Night for the first time. Really. Obviously, Alien and Chainsaw and Shining were ORIGINAL and had INCREDIBLE STORIES, so as far as just being FILMS, they are far superior.

208,jstlucas,Fast forward through the first 9 minutes,7,21 September 2020,"Not a bad movie. However, the incessant nonsense babbling for the first 9 minutes or so of this movie just dragged on and on and contributed so little to the movie. Ok, it shows a boyfriend who has a very minor part and some ""interference"" noise that is important throughout the movie, but that could have been done in a minute.

209,goatrope67,Pleasantly surprised,8,3 August 2020,"I heard nothing about this movie, just saw it on Shudder this weekend and was completely blown away. The concept is a group of friends decide to hold a seance on Zoom. Things do not go well. Since the pandemic started I have used Zoom on a near daily basis and initially wanted nothing to do with this movie because of that. I'm certainly glad I gave in and watched it. There were enough jump scares to keep me riveted and the acting performances were pretty damn stellar. I didn't recognize any of the actresses in the film which made even more surprising. I do hope though that this does not become the new ""found footage"" trend. If it does though, count this movie as among the top.",Host

212,metaCity,An original concept leads to a familiar story,6,18 August 2020,"Host is directed by Rob savage and developed for streaming service Shudder from a short film project by the director. It is a horror film based in the idea of holding a séance over zoom, the video conferencing cloud platform. Host starts with this inspired concept and leads us into a horror scenario that lasts as long as a zoom session and delivers the ultimate malware - demonic possession.
The film mixes original scares with more familiar ones. Camera filters materialise in the real world, a background video clip becomes increasingly unsettling. As the film progresses the scares become more recognisable and its debt to the found footage genre and particularly the first Paranormal Activity film becomes more apparent. Dark corridors, a creepy attic, always a house's graveyard, flour thrown on the floor to reveal footprints, cupboard doors swinging and banging, and characters pulled along the floor with the door slamming shut after them. These scenes work better in Host than in most films as it delivers them so many of them, and so quickly, you really feel the assault on the characters.
The cast is especially important in making Host work so well. With no backstories or deep characterisation, the film relies on their chemistry to establish believability, which they do very successfully. The improvisation, their reactions and interactions grounds the film and gives the fear and horror a foundation to grip onto. The zoom multiscreen having all the cast in constant closeup gives an almost Blair Witch level of close tension.
Host is one of the better horror films of the year. It's as contemporary as can be and harks back to some of the best recent horror films. The genre often stays away from new technology but there's really no reason to. A haunted screen can be as scary as a haunted house. It can be a portal, a gateway to demons in the cloud.",Host
213,Stotinumdog55,I don't get it,2,2 September 2020,"I really do not understand how this movie became so popular, its very poorly made and goes on far too long. It makes no sense how in a 45 minute zoom meet (shut off due to hitting the time limit) the friend in the UK went from daylight to pitch black in a short time period.I really wanted to like this, but it brings nothing new to the table.

222,scarletvonklutz,Host brings nothing new to the horror genre.,1,31 January 2021,"I honestly don't understand all the hype for Host. This film is just Unfriended with a half-assed seance. It brought nothing new to the horror genre, the acting was poor and the 'jump scares' are predictable. Setting the film during lockdown and using Zoom isn't pioneering filmmaking. The only time I jumped was towards the end because I was that level of bored I was more focussed on how many polaroids she'd taken rather than what was actually happening - and while I bring that up - Polaroid film is about $35 for 10 photos. Who the hell just wastes that while walking around their blacked out apartment? It's 2020, we all have smartphones so why not USE THE TORCH?! I know common sense is a rare sighting in horror but the 'found footage' genre really take stupidity to new lows.",Host

Certainly there are illogical actions taken, especially carrying around their laptops to capture what's going on, but would you have preferred them to have wandered out of shot so we could stare at n empty room? No. Stop being pseudo-intellectuals and just appreciate the madness. Best horror I've seen since Martyrs. Loved it.",Host

226,dioblackened,Utter Garbage,3,16 August 2020,"What's with the 6.7 rating at over 3k votes? This is not only a bad film but it's not even a film to begin with. It's less then a hour long. Not scary, characters obviously have no time to become familiar being it's a short film, the acting was ok but the writing and idea for this film are old and overdone. I can think of numerous similar films better than this one. Dark Summer, Dark Web, Unfriended, Friend Request, The Den, Pulse ect. This one is specific to a paranormal entity being spread through a video chat but it's still similar to all the ones I've mentioned and this one is by far the worst of them. I have to assume many of these reviews and ratings are just fans of Shudder itself and not necessarily this film. I wouldn't watch it again, that means it's a bad horror as I re-watch most 5 star and above horrors. 6.7? Come on that is beyond ridiculous.",Host
227,jtw929,Unfriended meets Paranormal Activity,9,1 August 2020,"First off, I was 100% skeptical of this film going in.The word gimmick came to mind. A 56 minute long film shot during quarantine over Zoom. From a critique standpoint, it seemed like a quick cash grab, trying to push a product out for streaming services thirsty for content.From a filmmaker standpoint, I said ""Damn, this should have been me"". When this all started back in March, one of the first things to pop in my head wasn't stocking up on water or ramen noodles. It was making a feature film with all this time on my hand.What I ended up with was a couple of made for quarantine fest short films starring myself. So when I first heard about this project a few days ago, one of my first thoughts was ""Wow, someone actually did it"".Yesterday, I decided to check it out and all I can say is wow, shockingly surprised (emphasis on shock).Immediately I was reminded of Unfriended: Dark Web. A 2018 film that I highly enjoyed. It took a while to get into a film that was already considered short as a feature. It would say by 20 minutes into this, that's when things took off. And when it takes off, it didn't stop.
Mixing a blend of Unfriended meets Paranormal Activity, one of the things this film does extremely well is the use of subtlety.
One factor that plays well with this film is that there is no traditional soundtrack that would normally be used to emphasize a jumpscare. Because without that in this film, it made it even more scary. The one thing that stuck with me the most is that idea of ""Did I just see that in the background?"".It is of course when the young female leads of this film think they are safe (even though you no that's not the case), when that use of subtlety is used the best. From that moment, this suspense train goes full speed with no intent on slowing down until the final minute.
I am still extremely impressed on how well the effects for this film came out. I am still wondering with the limitations that the filmmakers had, how they did some of this stuff.Usually in the expectations vs. reality of filmmaking, it's the expectations in your head as a filmmaker that you want big budget Marvel like special effects, and it's the reality that you end up with more or less a B movie straight to DVD starring Eric Roberts and Michael Madsen special effects.
My point is, in the rare occasion of small style filmmaking, this film pulls off reality beating expectations. I can't imagine the amount of patience the director had to of had with his cast and crew when trying to coordinate all of this.
Overall, I was highly impressed with this film, giving it a 9/10 on IMDB. I definitely recommend checking it out, especially at night with the lights off. I watched it during the day with lights on and was still freaked out.Shudder is easily becoming the go to for quality content in the horror genre. They definitely take an artistic approach with their choices and are not just about quick cash grabs.
Like A24, they are growing as a big player in this market and I am very excited to see where they go from here.",Host
228,Manpreet_S,Great addition to this new sub genre,8,31 October 2020,"I love this new ""Webcam Horror"" sub genre and movies like this is why. My only complain with this movie was its duration which is too short. I am note even sure it qualifies as a feature film as its less than an hour long. But in any case, if you like found footage style horror, don't miss this.",Host

230,christianaugustatanacio,Not what I expected,8,31 July 2020,I honestly not expecting anything on this film because at first I thought it was just your typical run of the mill Unfriended wanna be movie.

231,milesrdavis,Horror in the age of COVID,7,16 October 2021,"There's not much different about this movie, to set it apart from other ghost/demon/poltergeist flicks as far as the genre goes. It's a pretty standard FRIENDS+SEANCE+HORRIBLY WRONG equation. Where it delivers is the creativity of how they've pulled it off.I was curious to see a take on horror in the age of COVID, and Host doesn't disappoint. With a Zoom meeting seance you can really only expect so much in artistic license, but they throw it together pretty well. It was never corny or forced, and most of the actors did a good job not over acting the whole ""Oh look-it! We have to quarantine because of COVID!"" as I kind of expected.I would have left it at a 7 if that was it, but the fact they didn't prolong it needlessly like so many B-rate horror films and instead delivered a full movie in just under an hour makes the whole thing that much more better... I hate it when there's the endless suspenseful walks down a dimly lit hallway and door knobs turning reeeeeal slowwwwly. Edit those takes out of most of the indie type films in horror and you've got maybe thirty minutes of movie left.Anyhoo, good job! Kinda like a Black Mirror episode.",Host

1. Throwback to Paranormal Activity and Blair Witch
2. Clever writing to acknowledge Covid-19
3. All female actors were likable and real. (The male character was written to be obnoxious, and that he was.)

5. Unsuspecting moments in the writing. Mostly unpredictable.
6. Did I mention it's 56 minutes?",Host
236,facundofr,Great!,9,24 October 2020,"Original, refreshing, and very creative! The only problem with the movie is the fact that you can't connect with some of the characters, I mean, I couldn't care less about what is going to happen to them, if they die or survive, I don't care.",Host
237,lloydyb,Creepy jumps,8,13 August 2020,An atmospheric chiller with believable natural characters that draw you in to their joint Zoom séance. The movies low budget was rendered irrelevant due to the good timing and imagination of the director. However it's weakness was the lack of narrative and short running time; the film was more an episode in a horror TV show and so should be watched in that light to enjoy an hour's creepiness.,Host

Plot holes? Of course. No name actors? Check. Some predictable jumps? Nope. That's what made this movie so fun. You knew something was coming but it doesn't happen when most people expect it and I found that refreshing. It was a fun movie to watch and it's even more fun to watch with a few friends.",Host
242,petewentos,Novelty Quarantine Watch,3,25 October 2020,"This quarantine horror film is truly unique in terms of production, with the ensemble cast having to shoot entirely from their own homes and to create their own practical effects. Due to the unusual precautions which the crew had to face in order to comply with health standards at the time of the film's release, I have to commend them for creating something despite the circumstances... but besides that, this film has no other redeeming qualities.The plot was lackluster, offering nothing new or interesting that hasn't been done before in a found footage film, and the pacing wasn't that great, with the first sign of paranormal activity occurring about halfway through the hour-long film, but what really nailed the coffin and cemented the idea that this was a bad film in my eyes was the cheap jumpscare at the very end. Before that, I was thinking that maybe it was slightly good, but the ending was the worst I've ever seen in a film and I couldn't bring myself to give it a favorable review.If the lockdown didn't happen and we weren't all using Zoom, I don't think I'd recommend this film to anyone, but if you're bored and looking for an easy watch to put on your quarantine watchlist, I'd say go for it simply because of the experience... but there are definitely way better films out there that you could be watching right now instead of this one.",Host
243,widefrog,Well worth an hour of your time,10,13 October 2020,"The reason I love watching horror films is the 'need' to be creeped out. I was recently recommended Host as it may fit the bill...With an unoriginal premise & a running time just shy of the hour mark I wasn't expecting much. How wrong I was, this is a horror gem!!While it didn't 'scare' me as such, it was creepy!! Made all the more realistic in that it was filmed during full Covid-19 lockdown in the UK which is why it all takes place online via Zoom.Won't go into too much detail about the plot etc but it should be watched alone, at night. One of the best horrors I've seen in a while.",Host

It's short runtime works to its benefit and if you can look past its digital effects, there are some bouts of decent practical work. Don't expect anything profound in terms of script or plot though.

247,FictionM,Exactly what you'd expect,4,5 September 2020,"It's basically like watching a few mildly annoying people walk through a very lazy haunted house... But on zoom. If you watched this the day after your city's shelter in place order, you might have found this amusing, but 6 months in you'll just be glad it's only 60 minutes. I appreciate the conditions in which it was made, but I can also picture the filmmakers sitting on a zoom call (Rob, you're on mute... Oh, no you go. No you go... Sorry, you cut out for a moment) literally listing their favorite horror movie moments and, by committee, deciding which they're use in their film.",Host
248,wesker67,Extremely good for the budget,7,19 March 2021,"This film was made from pennies basically (in the film world). I liked the characters, their individual personalities and their relationships with each other which you can understand quickly. Events were pretty well set-up and the tension is surprisingly high but the way that the characters act in some scenarios makes no sense whatsoever, no one is going to randomly go out of their way to find a huge ass ladder, put it up to the attic and try to go up it with your laptop in your hand just because you heard a small bang.
No one is going think about putting their mask on because your friend across the street is being trapped inside a room. I liked that they tried to dodge some cliches in the beginning but like many films of this genre it's hard to dodge them all but I can respect that they at least tried to be unique.
Overall it's an average film but that is impressive given how much they spent on the film",Host

I think the acting in this was solid and their interactions really sold the story. It was one of those movies where what's in your mind is scary than what's happening on screen. I actually found myself feeling scared when stuff started to go sideways, which doesn't happen very frequently. I think the kind of ""real life"" vibe of this made it seem more realistic and scary.

If you pay attention and try to put yourself in the characters' positions and listen to all the little noises and stuff you're in for a ride.I rate movies based on how they make me feel, not on how much they cost to produce or what other people are saying about it.

256,ajruder,"The love is warranted. Fantastically well made, and scared the hell out of me.",8,6 June 2021,"I would like to start by saying this is not me giving reasoning of how this is ""the greatest horror film of all time"". I am a firm believer in the fact that there's no best in film, and I've made this apparent in all my reviews. This is my opinion, and other people will obviously agree and disagree with me, and that's totally okay. It's called opinions for a reason. Considering the movie is only 56 minutes long, it's worth the watch no matter what. Make your own choice on what you think. Just a quick forward whoever's reading.Now to the review. This movie is genuinely terrifying. And not only is it terrifying, it's a ""tiny budget with the cast and crew of like 20 doing everything all during covid and is still an amazingly well made movie"" terrifying. Seriously; please look into how this film was made. It will make you appreciate it so much more, which is what I feel like is one of the big oversights in a lot of these reviews. Not only was this movie started and finished in roughly 6 months, (most movies take 1-2 years) but it feels like a movie that was made in that timeframe. Again, the cast and crew of like 20 had to do rigging, setting, direction, and makeup all over zoom and in small intervals with small groups due to covid. Beyond impressive.Even with all of this, it's terrifying. The believable acting feels real, the jump scares work perfect and are terrifying, and the 56 minute run time is a huge strength (it all plays into the 50 minute free zoom call length). Genuinely, watching this film at 3 am in a dark house by myself was one of the worst mistakes of my life. It all just works so well.I do agree with others on the flaws of the plot being quite thin on ""who does a séance over Zoom"" but I suppose you could contribute that towards total quarantine boredom. The other thing is ""who the hell carries their computer around their house while being haunted by a demon"" and I could only say is ""maybe they don't want to be alone while going into the dark scary room?"". Bit of a stretch for both, but I feel like it's a workable valid answer. Still, minor flaws for an overall great movie.Seriously, please give it a watch. It's worth it for less than an hour of pure horror. Without a doubt one of the scariest movies I've ever seen, and is one of my favorite horror movies I've seen. Give it a shot. You won't be disappointed. Maybe you will. Who cares. Thanks for taking the time to read.",Host

They added something new to the horror industry witch is pretty rare in my horror experience and I have been watching horror movies since I was 2, I am now 27 and movies are my life especially horror movies. This is my first review and I plan on writing reviews with every movie I watch. Tombstone Reviews",Host
261,deadforhope,Terrible found footage,2,24 August 2020,First let me start by saying I love found footage and mockumentary horror probably my favorite in the horror genre next to 80s horror anyway this was a cool idea even though the group call thing has been done before (unfriended and unfriended 2 dark web) but the execution was god awful there really is no story just a lot of screaming and crying with no real direction,Host
262,gmoalic,"low budget movie,high budget to buy good critics",1,6 February 2021,"This movie is a complete joke,and after all the 'great' review i decided to watch it and make me think about another bad movie where nothing happens like 'paranormal activities ' or 'blairwitch project' .So take few people on zoom then add some weird noise and moving chair ,crying girls (because they re so afraid)then you'll get the most boring overrated movie,it look like a joke filmed by friends together,dont waste your time/",Host
263,LauraChris11,"Masterpiece, but with some mistakes...",9,18 February 2021,"Since I'm not fan of horror movies at all, I must admit that I've really enjoyed watching this one. Even idea of having horror through video call makes me even more impressed. But I've noticed some mistakes. Since when Haley's laptop/computer became smartphone/tablet...?
Anyway, good job guys.",Host
264,reichjon-23828,Meh...not bad.,5,8 December 2020,"One person asked, ""what kind of idiot does a seance on a Zoom meeting?"" To which I ask, what kind of idiot does a seance unless they're 12? What difference does it make?Which leads me to my next point -- I noticed a lot of other people saying ""who grabs their laptop and carries it with them to check out noises around the house?!"" Well...probably the kind of idiots who do seances over Zoom. Does it seem that unrealistic that they would bring the camera with them for the other participants of the seance to experience as well? I'm surprised so many people couldn't figure that out.So normally I'd take away 5 stars automatically for it being a found footage. That's how serious I am in my campaign against that type of uninventive, lazy filmmaking. However, I found the idea a little creative and relevant with the runtime being the length of a free Zoom meeting, so I gave it a shot. That it was 57 minutes was a huge strength, any longer would have been unacceptable. And given the fact this was filmed during a worldwide pandemic, I forgave the fact that it was filmed as found footage.All-in-all, it was a decent time. Nothing extraordinary, but not a pile of ass, either. Stay safe and healthy, everyone. ✌🏼",Host
265,kdstemmer,Extremely well done for what it is,9,31 May 2021,"This rather short movie has been done extremely well. From the start it is a Zoom session amongst friends and it all appears very natural as it slowly descents into a creepy horror session. The casual start of it makes you wonder whether this is going to be anything worth watching but as the session progresses, it slowly pulls you in and it eventually had me on edge all the way to the end....",Host

When it first started I thought the reviews were overrated, but then ........ All I can say is watch it. I hardly ever review but when I do, it's because it's worth it. This is well worth it. Very clever idea. I would get scared taking part in a seance if everyone was actually together in the same room, but the whole idea of this taking place with everyone in their individual homes, not being able to actually help each other. Brilliant idea and great acting by all. I had more than a few jumps. Well done.",Host
269,99brendanallen,"A bit slow, but way better than I expected",7,8 April 2021,"Minor spoilers ahead... Going into this movie, I expected it to be as bad as Unfriended, a found-footage film over Skype, so I had low expectations. However, I did not expect it to be this good. Although the first few minutes of the film were a bit slow, it really picked up. The final 25 minutes of the short one hour film was intense and the best. For a low budget film AND the actresses/actors themselves being locked in quarantine and having to do this on their own, is very impressive. Very well executed jump scares.. even I jumped a few times for a horror movie junkie. Even the acting. For the actors/actresses I never even heard of, did a great job. Very little moments I thought it wasn't realistic.What I liked about this is that during the final 25 minutes, the movie pulled off a gag from Paranormal Activity ""flour bit"" to see where the spirit is at. I thought that was cool. And wait until the credits at the end.. that was creative and actually made me laugh. Other than that, ""Host"" pulled off the style of Unfriended, but with Zoom, which none of us have never really heard of until the pandemic had hit last year.There's some parts of the movie that I didn't like and that was the duration. They could've expanded the movie to maybe 90 minutes. We could've learned about more things, but we didn't. I hope there is a sequel, but for only a one hour film in a lockdown in a pandemic, it blew me away how they did this with the people in their apartment or themselves. Although, I do get the whole short movie because of Zoom's 40 minute limit over 3 people, but it is what it is. Like I said, the final 25 minutes really blew me away on how it was executed. If you have the chance, check out the film. I enjoyed it and was very impressed after seeing how bad Unfriended was, a similar movie like this, but Host took it on a whole new level.",Host
270,jenniferclark1,A Fun Little Movie,8,17 August 2021,"I was impressed with Host, it's better than I expected and kept me entertained throughout. I didn't like the character Gemma, she was obnoxious as hell from the start.

271,slobinchair,"Very clever, on the ball and highly creative....",8,20 December 2020,"Top marks for creative idea, inventiveness, acting and editing. HOST has to be not only the best shocker to be made during lockdown but is high ranking in the genre overall. HOST is going to face inevitable comparisons to Blair Witch Project and is similar in simplicity and execution. I can say without FEAR of contradiction that this film has more scares and is better executed than a HOST of high budget Hollywood thrillers. Relying on the imagination of the viewer it will appeal to certain tastes where minimalism and tension built through expectations is the key. Very good indeed, well done guys!",Host

273,noory1,No.. just no.,1,5 September 2021,This is a fine example of what happens when a bunch of people decide to make a movie with a very low budget during a pandemic while probably drunk or high.A cliche and very poor story.Watch it if you have nothing better to do but it still is horrible.,Host

280,shoffman-83411,Better Than Expected,6,4 August 2020,"I'm not a big fan of found footage but I couldn't ignore all the hype this movie has generated so I gave it a shot. The best decision the film makers made was the run time. I would probably check out more found footage if it was kept to an hour or less. It's a good fit for that style of story telling. The down side to Host is that it features all the typical faults of found footage. First, the horror is hinged entirely upon jump scares. I will admit they do a good job of springing a few things on you unexpectedly but most ""scary"" moments were ones you could almost count down to. The other common flaw is what I call stretching the format. Host did a decent job of sticking to a believable found footage formate until the last 15-20 minutes of the movie where the characters begin carrying their devices as they search their surroundings in a manner that would never take place in a real situation. Ultimately, I think Host still ran 10-15 minutes too long but it's definitely worth a watch.",Host
281,Irivia,Just another paranormal movie,4,12 January 2021,"Nothing really special here... Another movie with paranormal activities with friends but this time using Zoom.

I mean, there is a paranormal thing killing your friends and inside the apartment, you were afraid and emotional but once you see your friend you do a elbow bump... We will be probaly dead in a second but let's not forget we are in a pandemic...",Host
282,cherocha,"All Buzz, No Substance",5,8 August 2020,"The movie definitely deserves points for timing and how it incorporated current events, but for very little else beyond the acting and a good setup.Spoilers!!!!!My biggest peeve and this review is pretty much only going to be peeves because they're being overlooked in almost every other review: the demonic entity when it was shown and particularly in jump-scare flashes looked cheap. Really cheap. You know the ones you'll see floating around in various jump-scare memes? Yep, that amateurish. It just wasn't ominous, or intimidating, or even particularly demonic. They really dropped the ball with that creature design aka the lanky guy they painted like a discount Insidious demon.I know they couldn't rely on it too much with the runtime but the suspense is what makes these types of movies work so well. They kind of hinge on it. It worked briefly in Host but then escalated from the typical poltergeist tropes and cliches (cupboard doors flying open) to very suddenly people being suspended fifteen feet in the air and having their necks snapped. I think a majority of deaths or attacks were just people being lifted into the air and slammed down like a biotic attack from Mass Effect. Happens about half a dozen times, not kidding.Boy did they love that pulley rig they had setup in the American character's apartment... we got not one but two basically identical sudden chair drags then her being dragged into the same hallway in another scene. That whole thing with people getting dragged out of rooms by unseen forces is really played out.The demon was way too overpowered. Characters were being whirled around like ragdolls in Garry's mod and it seemed to throw any sort of rules or conventions out the window (not in a good way) with three separate characters being slaughtered outside. What's to stop ol' demon Jack from venturing down to the town square to launch some folk into shop fronts and force-snap some necks? Because they weren't in on the zoom meet? Can he not access address books?Venturing outside worked in It Follows because of the lore but it didn't work here. There needs to be some rules or boundaries which is why movies like this are generally contained within a house, cave or some other closed setting and rarely will you see a character outside unless it's after a moment of escape or when they finally overcome the obstacle and break free etc. At one point the blonde character tried to escape but the demon blocked the door. Later the Asian character not only gets out no problem but makes her way next door and breaks into another character's house.Where did the dead boyfriend come from? We didn't see him vanish or die and next minute he's dropping from the ceiling into frame for a jump-scare? Just such lazy plot contrivances that don't make any sense and with no setup at all...What's with the guy on fire? Did the demon douse him in lighter fluid because skin doesn't just combust like a wick but that guy went up like a Monk in 1960s Vietnam...There were no rules. There needs to be in horror movie like this unless you're going the avant-garde approach which this didn't. Same tropes and cliches redeemed only by the acting and timing. If not for how current it is and admittedly it really touched on events and utilised them in such a way that it epitomises tapping into the zeitgeist or contemporary culture perfectly, but if not for that I don't think this movie would be seen as anything other than a gimmick that's already been done to death. Granted it does a better job of it than films like Unfriended but it's overshadowed by how wholly unoriginal it is outside of the social isolation gimmick.",Host

The movie accurately reflects the times and does not lightly skim over the new norms such as elbow bumps instead of hugs or handshakes. I thought it was going to be gimmicky and hokey. I was pleasantly surprised and truly put on the edge of my seat. The length of the movie is even the same as a the free version of a Zoom meeting.

290,aisdeath,Genuinely one of the most well thought out horrors I've seen,10,11 August 2020,"Ok-so I'm an actor. An actor who does a fair chunk of horror. An actor, who does a large chunk of horror who also LOVES horror. This is one of the most well executed horror movies I have EVER seen, from a simple but well executed story to an absurdly strong cast, to pace that at no point lagged. It is a testament to Sheppard and Savage and their cast that I screamed at various points throughout the film-very few horror films elicit such a visceral response from me, and I watch enough of them that I can be numb to a lot of scares. Sometimes low budget and adverse conditions help facilitate a work that stays with you and that's exactly what's happened here.",Host

The storyline is pretty obvious, there isn't really anything new, not even a small plot twist, which kinda sucks. However, I got to say that I'm in love with the way that the group friendship really seemed real, i don't know how to explain it better, but the girls' (and Teddy's) conversation felt so genuine, not movie-genuine but reality-genuine, and that's the reason I'm rating it 7 stars, since not a lot of movies can sell this idea.

My heart beats feeling all over up to my ears with all the thumping oscillating in it. I was clunched and holding my hands to my mouth to atleast hope that nothing goes wrong.

Pleasantly surprised. Actually got the creeps a few times (especially towards the end). I even let out a gasp/scream a few times which is not my usual reaction when watching horror.There are a few things that kinda bothered me if I used too much logic. Ex. NO ONE would take their computer with them to stay on a freaking zoom while running for their life. But if you let yourself enjoy it for what it is, and don't let that distract you it is definitely worth the watch!

Good performances, genuine characterisation, good jumpscares, good direction, good screenplay, it was near perfect.The best thing is the Covid19 was not the main perspective in the storyline, it was just the background check and the director used it really well.Bravo to the entire team, specially to those two (a man and a woman) stunt performers.",Host

I think part of it is because it was done in the concept of the current climate (Covid) and because it's something I know a few people have attempted. All actors were believable which is a nice bonus these days for non celeb actors. I had to pause it halfway through because I had to put my bin out in the dark and I didn't want to go out lol! The description doesn't do it justice. It takes a hell of a lot to scare me as a rule, so this was well made. I felt frustrated alongside Hayley. I felt annoyed about some people's behaviours and I was rooting for others. To me, making you feel emotional about characters is what makes a good film.

319,thecrystalswordbyalex,"It's Unfriended, but less stupid and really boring.",3,9 September 2020,"So I saw this film completely blind and after watching it. I personally found the movie Dull and Boring and didn't find it scary at all. Like I was really hoping this was gonna be ""Unfriended"" but actually good, but no it was arguable less stupid then but it was still pretty dumb in my eyes.I mean more power to anyone that likes the film and found it scary, but I mostly board throughout the entire film and really I felt like this film is being blinded with praise because of the gimmick and that its set in a current event that all of us are facing right now and we're all on edge about.Here are a couple of problems I had with this film.There are literally no characters in this film, they're all just very one-dimensional character that only served to be a victim to this demon.15 minutes of the film is wasted on the usual, hey this is real life and in real-life there are boring moments... yeah, still doesn't change the fact that it's boring. Could have been used to really flesh out the characters, but nope, just do mundane things that do nothing but to pad the very short film.Each character pretty much does an in your face Chekhov's gun, like showing a video effect on the screen, which made it pretty damn obvious a scare is gonna happen using it.I saw no solid good reasons why these people would want to waste their time doing this sequence thing, to begin with.Yes, there is Lock-Down, but where not in like the Purge, people are still able to leave the house, call the cops, run next door to your neighbors (which one of the characters did) so I didn't felt the quarantine of this pandemic added or did anything to this film at all.You see these characters being tossed around and witnessing some crazy stuff, but they still think its important to carry their Laptops, Tablets, or Cell Phone around when they have no good reason to other than so us the audience can see what is happening.Why was the last person alive took her laptop around the room other then so we the audience can see what happens?A large portion of the scares in this film is the tried and true lazy in your face loud jump scare.",Host
320,bigspuds-62713,Terrible,1,6 August 2020,Unoriginal rubbish. I can only suspect the people who have given this good reviews are friends of the cast or film makers. I've had more entertainment watching hair dry. Acting could be worse I suppose but besides that this film has absolutely nothing going for it. Its less than an hour and its still fifty minutes longer than it needs to be.,Host

326,pandpdesigns,Definitely worth a watch!,8,3 August 2020,"Ok so I really liked this movie, I'm not all that great at leaving reviews but really felt I had to with this one. I watched it alone at night and I'm a pretty hardened horror fan, I don't scare easily, but always find the lower budget and ghost type things with less gore and more left to the imagination, are more likely to give me the scares I seldom get these days. Now this little beauty definitely scared me, yes it's mostly good old fashioned jump scares, but do you know what, that's ok with me, they were well placed, no over hyped music, no great special effects and I honestly squealed on a couple of occasions! This is a low budget, shot on webcam/video messenger gem! It's short, sweet and I honestly think it was pretty damn scary! Cheers shudder it's been a long time since I felt like sleeping with the light on lol well done to the actors, crew and writers you did a damn good job of making a fun, scary little number using COVID quarantine as the back drop, if I had seen this at the cinema I think I would have peed my pants a little in a couple of occasions!

329,rikuamv,Good Amateur Movie,7,13 August 2020,"Even though the movie was made as an amateur, they did most of the things right. Although the atmosphere of the movie stunned me, the story could have been more prominent. It is very important to keep the film in the same places for 50 minutes without boring the audience. Some jumpscares are unexpected, but some are cliché. Also, I think they could make things more interesting. Personally, I would wait for the film to arrive at the end to see the first psychic woman understand what it was.",Host
330,danjamesmarsden,Disturbing and creepy film well worth an hour of your time.,10,18 August 2020,"I've been a fan of horror since I was a young lad and its been ages since I've watched a film that unsettled me as much as this has done. Firstly its a very clever premise that works perfectly. The build up is succinct and to the point and you get sucked into the narrative very quickly. The characters in the film are surprisingly well fleshed out especially considering the short run time and that draws you into genuinely caring about what is happening to them. The acting from all of the stars of the film is top notch and very believable and this adds to the build up of tension. This tension builds throughout the film very effectively and leaves you feeling very creeped out. The jump scares are excellent, helped by the convincing acting.In short a very effective creepy film, well worth an hour of your time. I'm not sure why the low reviews but I've already re-watched it twice (trying to spot easter eggs) and found it just as unsettling every time.",Host
331,Patrick-R-McDonough,The New Standard,10,6 August 2020,"This film will surely create the new standard for a few things - runtime and style. For starters, the runtime - 56 minutes - should be practiced in the future. It's enough time to satisfy your quench for film, yet short enough where it does not overstay its welcome. Had a studio forced the filmmakers to pile another forty minutes or so on, it would have felt dragged out.Host was the film I didn't know I needed. I haven't been able to go to the theatres (horror or other) in the past five months. It takes such a ""normal"" thing that we all use these days, Zoom, or skype, or any other communication tool, and makes it scary. No, not scary...terrifying. It does it well, and like any good story, they make every minute count. All the way through to the end credits - which I may like to add that I particularly enjoy creativity done with any kind of credits, and how they formatted the end credits was brilliant and very fitting.The effects were perfect, the startling scare scenes were perfect, the buildup was what makes it so damn addictive, and the acting felt nonexistent, meaning, it all felt real. Nothing was forced. This is not only a film worth watching if you're still stuck at home, it's a film that'll plague your mind with all the dread and terror that I was filled with.Still am, actually.A final word of advice, watch this alone. I watched it alone in my house, and it wasn't even dark out, yet, it rooted into my nerves and shook them into a frenzy.",Host

333,granthenneberger,A Great Horror Movie,10,18 March 2021,"I loved watching this movie. It was a thrill ride throughout. This movie is great because of how it puts you in the line of danger as the camera of the computers. It brings you closer to the danger and makes it terrifying. I've heard other people saying that it is too formulaic and you know what's going to happen but that just makes it more suspenseful as you wait for what you know is going to happen. There's a bit where the character is like ""I'm gonna go in the attic"" and you know there's going to be something in the attic but it's a long crawl up the stairs and they swivel around and only on the way down do you see something which is terrifying because you're in the position of the camera and are right next to it. I love this movie because it was a low budget movie being made in lockdown and it still ended up being terrifying and very entertaining for me and my dad, who's loved horror movies since he was 10",Host

I don't have a problem with them carrying around their phones and laptops like other reviewers. I honestly think it makes more sense than not.
But overall lacks a storyline! Not that the horror genre lends itself to incredible storytelling and depth but this was a very monotone and superficial type of film. Didn't even make up for it with incredible cinematography. I did like the catalyst idea though! So overall meh, not disappointed I saw it but wouldn't watch again",Host

Basically we know the format from similar movies like dark web, unfriended etc.
however in this case the characters feel far more organic.we have a group of middle-class student types deciding to have a seance online over skype or zoom during the ongoing pandemic.
the group swiftly become terrified and lose their heads, prepare for much crying and screaming while the characters manage to do nothing in the way of helping one another.Amazing really that one of our protagonists has the clarity of mind to affix her face mask before she escapes her home in panic.

After finally giving in and watching it though, I will admit it is generally an enjoyable and suspenseful horror. While you can see the jump scares coming, it's the claustrophobic suspense along with the five main actresses' performances that really make this flick. I say five main because my only real complaint about this movie is the character of Teddy. This obnoxious, man-bun wearing tool is completely unnecessary. He brings nothing to this movie at all save adding a few extra minutes. It really didn't even make sense that the spirit would be haunting him as he wasn't even in the zoom call when the actual seance really took off. The only cool thing about him was his creepy music box that could have easily been given to another character (namely Radina in my opinion). In fact his whole death scene could've been given to Radina as her death scene paled in comparison to the others. I wouldn't even mention his character except for the fact that it genuinely took me out of the horror mindset every time he was onscreen. Don't let that keep you from watching it though.

At under an hour, I was a little doubtful that they could generate a enough suspense aligned with a decent story, and after watching it, I felt this was the case.The first 20 mins are watchable, and the banter amongst the friends is believable, with a few laughs and suspense being built. Then suddenly it feels like all thought of suspense was cast aside and they just threw in as many jump scares and ridiculous character decisions as possible. It felt so rushed and there was not one part where I felt on edge or theoretically had the remote in my hand ready to turn down the volume to avoid a fright. It was almost comical the speed at whjc everything happened and all I could think about was wishing the movie would end so I could get another beer.It felt like there was potential after the first 20 mins, but disappointingly this was thrown away with the last part of the film, in place of generic jump scares and fairly obvious outcomes to scenes.How does this movie have 100% of positive critic reviews on Rotten Tomatoes?

The movie literally ends with a jump scare, that's how clever the writers were.

But surprisingly, the movie is very accurate as to how an actual zoom call operates.
The beginning legitimately freaked me out because of the atmospheric sounds being very frightening.
It kinda became more campy near the end to get as many cheap scares as possible.
