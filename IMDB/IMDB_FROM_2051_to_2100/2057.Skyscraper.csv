0,TheLittleSongbird,Limited sky,5,6 August 2018,"Although it did seem like it was going to be fairly derivative and it was not the best received of films critically, there was something that oddly interested me in seeing 'Skyscraper'. Have an appreciation for action/thriller films ('Die Hard' being one of the finest examples), the advertising didn't make one want to avoid it and Dwayne Johnson is a likeable enough guy, even if not the greatest of all actors.'Skyscraper' did not strike me as a terrible film when seeing it. It does have a fair share of good things. It is also not a particularly good film either, it's pretty problematic with also its fair share of flaws. If there is one word to sum up 'Skyscraper' it would be watchable, another couple of words would be inoffensive and average. There is nothing really to be offended by, also not enough to be blown away by.There are good things here. It is not a bad looking film, the photography is gritty and stylish and the scenery suitably formidable. There are some fun and quite incredible looking set pieces and stunts and an affectionate nod to 'The Lady of Shanghai' with the hi-tech mirror sequence.Dwayne Johnson is a likeable and charismatic lead and Neve Campbell also turns in an above average performance. The music, while not exactly memorable, isn't too over-bearing and fits at least.What lets 'Skyscraper' down is a story that does frequently get rather too silly and sometimes flabby, in the non-action and stunt scenes there is a lack of suspense and tension and it is very predictable and sometimes illogical. The script lacks tautness too and its lack of natural flow and cheesiness further hurts it. Not much brains or soul here.None of the characters are properly fleshed out, with very cartoonish and flat adversaries which makes the threat neither sinister or urgent. Direction is uneven, coming to life in the action but losing momentum elsewhere. The editing could have been tighter too.Overall, watchable but average. 5/10 Bethany Cox",Skyscraper
1,Leofwine_draca,Turn off your brain and enjoy,7,20 January 2019,"SKYSCRAPER is another big-bucks Hollywood action flick, full of CGI effects work and fiery explosions. It was shot in Hong Kong with a Chinese supporting cast and a few old-timers showing up including SCREAM's Neve Campbell and villain regular Noah Taylor. The plot is literally DIE HARD meets THE TOWERING INFERNO, and given that those are two of my very favourite movies, I was eager to see this.In the end, it turns out to be just as entertaining as I'd hoped for. Nowhere near the quality of the two films it rips off, of course, but as good as it could be in the circumstances. The Rock is an intensely likeable screen presence and his single-legged schtick is handled well. The various high-rise stunts are preposterous but surprisingly suspenseful in places. The lead villain is entertainingly imposing and the running time flies past with one twist and set-piece after another. As usual, things get a bit too CGI-dominated at the climax, with the best fight scene the early one in the apartment, but generally this is a perfect slice of turn-off-your-brain style fun.",Skyscraper
2,SnoopyStyle,over the top,4,17 August 2018,"Ten years earlier, FBI tactical unit leader Will Sawyer (Dwayne Johnson) is injured in a hostage situation. He is saved by his surgeon and future wife Sarah (Neve Campbell) although he loses his left leg. In the present day, he is hired by tycoon Zhao Long Ji who has just finished his record breaking skyscraper in Hong Kong. International terrorist Kores Botha has his own plans. The police are confused and suspects Will as a terrorist who started a fire in the new building. Will has to run from the police and the terrorists while trying to rescue his family trapped in the burning building.This is trying to be Die Hard with a healthy dose of Fast and Furious. Unlike Die Hard, much of this is outrageous to the point of illogical. The action is over the top. The Rock is superhuman and quite frankly, Neve Campbell is Mrs. Superhuman. I can live with the ridiculous action but I don't think the characters make sense. There is the really inconvenient switch placement in the blades of non-sense but why would the bad guys leave The Rock alone after capturing him and his daughter. Whatsup with the crazy Enter The Dragon room? These terrorists have all kinds of stuff. They should at least try some explosives on the door. This is far from Die Hard. It has no humor. It's not even trying to be funny. John McClane is a human being who gets hurt a lot. The Rock here is impervious and impregnable. That's this movie. It is hard to feel for non-human non-humorous impregnable characters.",Skyscraper

The Hong Kong police think that Will might have been complicit in the breakout of the fire however Will needs to get back into the building to rescue his family who are staying there.It lacks the zippy one liners and the clever plotting of Die Hard. It certainly lacks a memorable villain and The Rock is certainly no everyman like Bruce Willis in Die Hard.

4,claudio_carvalho,The Towering Inferno with Die Hard,7,8 September 2018,"""Skyscraper"" is an action-disaster movie with a sort of combination of ""The Towering Inferno"" and ""Die Hard"". The screenplay does not develop the characters well but it is breathless with funny action scenes. It also good to see Neve Campbell performing a supporting character but with important participation despite the absolute lack of chemistry with Dwayne Johnson. The plot is absurd but it is a good to see an action film with this type of exaggeration. The extinguishing effect of CO2 is based on the principle of lowering the oxygen content in the air to a value at which the combustion process cannot be sustained. Therefore it is hilarious to see the characters surviving after the release of CO2. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Arranha-Céu: Coragem Sem Limite"" (""Skyscraper: Courage without Limit"")",Skyscraper
5,nogodnomasters,Towering Die Hard Inferno,6,27 July 2018,"A super skyscraper of 3500 feet is built in Hong Kong, because you can never over compensate. Will Sawyer (Dwayne Johnson) is hired to certify the building's safety and security. His family gets to live in an ultra modern suite...in the building. Will was special ops and was injured, losing his left leg below the knee. This is because no situation can match a whole Dwayne Johnson, so we have to give him a handicap to make it interesting. After a double cross and a deliberate fire (reason was stupid) we discover that fools do fight in a burning building. Will must scale the burning building, dodge bullets from the police, kill the bad guys, explain the plot, and rescue his family....with one leg inside an inferno.

6,kosmasp,Dwayne the Sky (is the limit) Johnson,6,18 October 2018,"Yes I know it's the Rock and not the Sky. I hope you don't mind me juggling with the title here a bit. While this is a sort of disaster movie (self inflicted if you want to call it that), it is also a ride. Not fun, more like a tension filled one. And when you have a charismatic actor like Dwayne in the lead, anything can happen ... literally gravity defying things! I saw memes about one thing, where people went like, that's not realistic (physics wise) ... well if that's your angle, you won't enjoy this one bit.Then you also have Neve Campbell. And while she is the wife (smaller role), she also has some nice scenes, where she has things to do other than look cute. Overall it is refreshing to see her on the big screen (not really a comeback, since she's been back on TV and other stuff). Not a great movie, but if the setting is something that attracts you, it'll be worth your time",Skyscraper
7,jboothmillard,Skyscraper,5,19 July 2018,"I saw the trailer for this film a couple of times before its release, it looked to me like Die Hard Meets The Towering Inferno, and that's pretty much exactly what it is, I went to see it for some easy non-thinking fun, directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber (Dodgeball, We're the Millers, Central Intelligence). Basically Will Sawyer (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) is a former FBI Hostage Rescue Team leader and U.S. war veteran, he had his left leg amputated from the knee down after a previous mission, where a man blew himself up with a bomb. Sawyer, now wearing a prosthetic leg, and married to the surgeon who operated on him, Sarah (Neve Campbell), now works as a security systems specialist. He is tasked with inspecting and assessing ""The Pearl"" in Hong Kong, standing at 3,500 feet (1,100 m) and 225 stories tall it is the highest skyscraper in the world, built by high level Asian financier Zhao Long Ji (Chin Han). The construction of the super-skyscraper is near completion, all floors have already been constructed, a large wind turbine controls power, and advanced computer technology can prevent any breach of security and extinguish any fire. However, rival gangsters led by international terrorist kingpin Kores Botha (Roland Møller) is determined to destroy the structure and extort millions, using a memory card containing money laundering tracking information. Following Sawyer's inspection of the building, and with his wife and children, Georgia (McKenna Roberts) and Henry (Noah Cottrell), already moved in to a penthouse in The Pearl, Sawyer's former FBI colleague Ben (Pablo Schreiber) is in cahoots with the terrorists and helps them get access to the building. Later that night, while Ben tries to stop Sawyer from interfering, Botha and his team of mercenaries ignite the 96th floor of The Pearl, blocking access to all higher floors and knocking out the computer controlled advanced fire extinguishing hardware meticulously constructed throughout the skyscraper. Sawyer unintentionally mortally wounds Ben in a fight, but before dying he tells him about the situation, meanwhile rescue operations are completely cut off from reaching the upper floors of the building, and the terrorists have used Sawyer's identification to access the security systems, framing him as the culprit of the sabotage. Sawyer races to the skyscraper to save his family trapped inside, but the police are informed that he is a suspect, but he manages to evade arrest, and begins ascending a tall crane in an effort to gain access into the building. Sawyer manages to leap into the building, he reaches his family, he saves Sarah and Henry, putting them in a free-falling elevator with an emergency brake, he is unsure if they made it safely to the ground, but Georgia is taken hostage by the terrorists. Long Ji is also trapped in the building, but he and his colleagues know that the fire will not reach their level for some time, Long Ji has locked himself inside using his own impenetrable high security, the terrorists have no way to get to him. Botha is demanding that Sawyer finds a way to get to Long Ji, who has the memory card containing information and access to the laundered millions, he threatens to harm Georgia if he does not. Sawyer sees the only way to breach the security systems is to scale the outside of the building, to damage the power that controls the wind turbine, which will cut off all power throughout the building. Meanwhile, the police have rescued Sarah and Henry, Sarah tries to convince them that Sawyer is not responsible for the fire, identifying Bocha as the ringleader, and recognising that the terrorists are wearing parachutes, that they will use to escape. Sarah and the authorities work together to find the true culprits who are hiding somewhere in the outskirts of the city, while Sawyer has managed to cut off the power, he and Long Ji eventually agree to work together to stop the terrorists. The gang are getting ready to make their escape from the top of the building, but with the help of a hall of digital mirrors, Sawyer manages to trick them into harming each other, until only Bocha remains, Sawyer kills him. But the fire has finally reached the top of the building, it looks like he and Georgia are trapped to perish, but Sarah and the police have located the rest of the criminals, Sarah uses the stolen tablet, turning it off and on again, to reactivate the security system and reboot the computer to extinguish the fire. In the end, the fire is under control, Long Ji is wounded, but says he will rebuild, and Sawyer is reunited with his family. Also starring Noah Taylor as Mr. Pierce, Hannah Quinlivan as Xia, Byron Mann as Inspector Wu and Kevin Rankin as Ray. Johnson is fast becoming the big action hero of the times, Campbell is okay as well, the stunts are hair-brained and over-the-top, the dialogue is cheesy, and it is almost ridiculous and laughable what happens, but it is thrilling in the right places, there is a nice homage to The Lady of Shanghai with the high-tech mirror sequence, clever uses for duct tape, and you've got The Rock to save the day, nothing wrong with that, a silly but fun enough action film. Worth watching!",Skyscraper
8,Tweekums,Fun 'brain in neutral' action,7,8 May 2019,"Will Sawyer was a US Marine who went on to lead an FBI hostage rescue team until an operation went explosively wrong. This caused him serious injury, losing one leg below the knee. He rebuilt his life though, married his doctor and had a couple of children. Now he and his family are in Hong Kong, living in the newly finished Pearl Tower, the tallest building in the world. His job there is to assess the buildings fire protection and security systems. As he heads to an off-site facility he is attacked by unknown assailants; it turns out they wanted the security device that will give them access to the buildings systems. Soon afterwards other attackers set fire to the building; leaving Sawyer's family trapped in the near-empty upper floors. Also in the upper floors are the building's owner and his staff.Sawyer is initially suspected of involvement with the fire but he doesn't have time to answer police questions; he has to get back into the building and save his family... as well as uncover the attackers' motives and thwart their plans.If you want a film with a strong, twist-filled plot and strong characters then this is unlikely to please you. However if you want lots of exciting 'brain-in-neutral' then this fits the bill nicely. An explosive opening scene shows us how our protagonist came to lose a leg and meet his wife then, following a short explanation of what he is doing now and a tour of key areas of the building the action kicks off and rarely slows down till the end credits roll. Dwayne Johnson impresses as Sawyer; the only character with any real depth. This is the film's main weakness; we may learn the villains' motives but none of them are particularly interesting characters. The special effects are good and the numerous shots looking down create a good sense of vertigo... I imagine these looked great on the big screen. Overall not a must see but I'd recommend it to fans of action, especially if you like Wayne 'The Rock' Johnson's films.",Skyscraper
9,BA_Harrison,"Welcome to the party, Dwayne!",6,13 July 2018,"Skyscraper is a 21st century Die Hard meets The Towering Inferno mash-up, with a one-legged Dwayne Johnson ('cos disabled black people can be action heroes too) in the John McClane/Steve McQueen role, the action ramped up to ridiculous levels ('cos modern action films don't let plausibility get in the way of thrills and spills), and the violence toned down to a 12-A rating to pull in a younger demographic.Set in Hong Kong, no doubt to appeal to the lucrative Asian market, the film stars 'The Rock' as ex-FBI agent Will Sawyer, who lost his leg during a botched hostage situation ten years earlier. Will now works as a fire/security expert and is called in to assess the world's tallest building, The Pearl, the brainchild of billionaire Zhao Long Ji (Chin Han). When the 96th floor of the building is set ablaze by a gang of ruthless criminals, trapping Will's wife (Neve Campbell) and kids above the fire line, our fearless muscle-bound hero attempts a daring rescue mission.Packed with state of the art special effects and numerous scenes of mild peril, Skyscraper is undemanding blockbuster nonsense that, despite the countless risks taken by Sawyer, feels far too safe to be wholly satisfying. The formulaic and predictable plot holds very few surprises - we know from the outset who the bad guys are, that Will's prosthetic leg will be used to save his life, and that the high-tech hall of mirrors (shades of Enter the Dragon) will feature heavily in the finalé, all of which seriously undermines the tension. If the sight of Johnson leaping from a crane to the burning building (grabbing hold of a ledge with his super strong fingertips) or traversing the tower's exterior like Spiderman (with the help of duct tape) doesn't sound like a stretch too far, have at it, but I couldn't help but feel a little underwhelmed by the overfamiliarity of the material and its sheer predictability.",Skyscraper
10,paul_haakonsen,"Time to ""Die Hard"" all over again...",5,19 October 2018,"Right, well this was essentially just ""Die Hard"" unraveled and packed into a new presentation.I must admit that I had expected a bit more from the movie. And it was a slap to the face to come to realize that it was essentially just a knock-off of the old Bruce Willis movie, all in all.Was ""Skyscraper"" a good movie? Nah. But it wasn't bad either. It was adequate, just suffered horribly from a total lack of innovation and imagination. The storyline was so scripted that you knew exactly what would happen throughout the entire course of the movie, and it did do exactly that. So I guess on that account the movie didn't fail to deliver.Sure, the action sequences were bountiful and well executed, but it just felt like it was a horrible copy and paste wrapping pulled down on an empty shell of a storyline. Because if you have seen ""Die Hard"", then there essentially is no need for you to watch ""Skyscraper"". Unless you are a die hard (pardon the pun) fan of Dwayne Johnson, of course.The special effects in the movie were quite good, but an abundance of action sequences and good special effects could only do so much to carry up all the shortcomings that the movie had in terms of characters, acting, plot, script and realism.""Skyscraper"" is the type of movie that you watch once, then never again, because it just doesn't have the same level of contents that ""Die Hard"" did. So in a sense, I guess ""Skyscraper"" will go off to die hard after you've seen it once...",Skyscraper
11,BandSAboutMovies,"A ripoff, but a well done ripoff",5,12 October 2018,"How close is this movie to The Towering Inferno and Die Hard? Just take a look at one of two posters that its star, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, commissioned to celebrate those films when this was released. Look - this is a summer blockbuster. If you're going to worry about how much it steals or how stupid it is, you picked the wrong movie.Wealthy Chinese financier and entrepreneur Zhao Long Ji is building the tallest skyscraper in the world in Hong Kong called The Pearl. To solve some of the building's security issues, he hires former U.S. Marine and retired FBI Hostage Rescue Team leader Will Sawyer (Johnson). Even though he's built a new life for himself, Sawyer is struggling with the past, including a mission where a suicide bomber took his left leg.Once he gets the job of inspecting the Pearl, Sawyer, his wife Sarah (Neve Campbell, Scream) and twins Georgia and Henry move in. It seems like the building's fire and security systems are secure, but he doesn't trust the building's offsite security center. Zhao gives Sawyer a tablet that gives him full access to the security system, but our protagonist is set up by his former partner, ex-FBI agent Ben Gillespie.Now, a cadre of terrorists and criminals led by Kores Botha has taken over The Pearl, with Sawyer's family trapped inside. Soon, the building is on fire, loved ones are trapped and the film becomes extended stunt sequences where The Rock jumps from a crane into a burning building hundreds of feet above the Earth. Your enjoyment of this film will depend on how many times you want to see The Rock cheat death.We watched this with Becca's parents, who were a divided lot. Her mother enjoyed this film more than any living being has ever loved a movie before, jumping and yelling with every single stunt, literally on the edge of her seat. But her father was upset the minute the movie started, sure that it was going to be unrealistic. Well, he was right. He's also someone unafraid to loudly drum his opinion into your ear for the entire running time of a film, so he threatened to rage quit watching it. It's not often that you get to watch a movie with two people who have such opposite opinions, yet are sitting so close.",Skyscraper

13,hitchcockthelegend,It's an ultimate frame of mind movie.,6,28 April 2019,"It is what it is, it's Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson as the hero of the tale who has to achieve the impossible when the world's tallest building catches fire. His family is trapped in said building inferno and there's bad guys running around creating trouble.So sit down and get ready for fantastically high energy action scenes and hold your breath peril sequences.

14,CinemaSerf,"""Mom, are we going to die?"" ... ""Only of boredom, honey!""",5,20 June 2020,"Dwayne Johnson is very much off his best in this rather derivative ""Towering Inferno"" with better gadgets escapade. Criminals infiltrate the world's tallest and supposedly most secure building and, with his family trapped inside, he (""Sawyer"") must discover who is betraying whom, why - and, of course, rescue his wife and two children before the conflagration really gets out of hand... This could have been much better had Johnson been better, but the fight scenes lack - well - punch; the timing is lacklustre; indeed the whole film is just a shade sloppy. The effects, the fire and the gizmos are all excellent, but the story is frankly daft and just like so many John Wayne films or Perry Mason investigations - no real jeopardy or suspense about the ending robs the film of much of it's pace and purpose. It is a good looking effort, but it could really have done with a more identifiable, menacing and sophisticated baddie/foil for our hero; and much, much, less of the screeching daughter shouting ""Daddy, Daddy"" much of the time...",Skyscraper
15,zardoz-13,Between A Rock and A Hard Place!!!,7,7 August 2018,"The villains in the predictable but entertaining cliffhanger ""Skyscraper"" find themselves literally caught between a rock--Dwayne Johnson--and a hard place--the world's tallest building. ""Central Intelligence"" writer & director Rawson Marshall Thurber must have been thinking about the Bruce Willis thriller ""Die Hard"" (1988) and Irwin Allen's classic disaster epic ""The Towering Inferno"" (1974) when he cobbled together this derivative, white-knuckled hokum. While the CGI passes muster, Dwayne Johnson amounts to ""Skyscraper's"" the biggest special effect. The Rock's charismatic presence redeems this far-fetched, but formulaic caper with clichés galore. Nevertheless, Johnson challenges himself because his character has suffered the consequences for adversity. A former FBI Agent who almost bought the farm in a bomb blast when he cornered a suicide bomber, our hero lost his left leg below the knee and now sports a prosthetic leg. Thurber exploits this handicap for maximum suspense during a daredevil, window-walking act outside the tower reminiscent of Tom Cruise's shenanigans on a similar skyscraper in ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol."" Ostensibly, the message is you need not be all-in-one-piece to pull off the impossible. No, this isn't the first time a hero with a handicap has triumphed over cinematic malefactors. As a photographer with a broken leg in a plaster cast, James Stewart tangled with a depraved spouse-slayer in Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece ""Rear Window"" (1954), while Spencer Tracy contended with the bad guys as a one-armed troubleshooter in John Sturges' ""Bad Day at Black Rock"" (1955). Asian actor Jimmy Wong Yu portrayed a resilient warrior in ""The One-Armed Swordsman"" (1967), ""Return of the One-Armed Swordsman"" (1969), and ""The One-Armed Swordsman Against Nine Killers"" (1976). Unmistakably, ""The Crippled Masters"" (1979) ranks as the ultimate action movie with two handicapped heroes played by genuinely lame guys in real-life. In this outlandish Hong Kong actioneer, a man without legs teamed up with a guy without arms to fight as one against an army of thugs. Many more movies too numerous to name have featured heroes with disabilities, but this is the Rock's debut as a physically encumbered combatant. This is probably the most inventive element in ""Skyscraper"" because the protagonist must not only defeat his adversaries, but he must also conquer his own limitations!
""Skyscraper"" starts with FBI Agent Will Sawyer (Dwayne Johnson of ""Rampage"") and his Hostage Rescue Team surrounding a suicide bomber in a cabin in the middle of nowhere. This ill-fated rendezvous with mortality happened a decade before the events that take place in Hong Kong. Since he lost his leg, Sawyer had to leave the FBI. Now, he works out of his garage at home as a security consultant. As fate would have it, the top-flight Navy surgeon who saved his life later became his wife. ""Scream"" queen Neve Campbell plays Sawyer's wife Sarah. They have two children: an older daughter, Georgia (newcomer McKenna Roberts), and a younger son Henry (newcomer Noah Cottrell) with asthma problems. They accompany Will to China to meet his prospective new employer, Zhao Long Ji (Chin Han of ""The Dark Knight""), a visionary billionaire who erected the Pearl, a 3000-foot pinnacle looming majestically over the heart of Hong Kong. Mind you, Zhao might never have known about Will had Sawyer's former FBI colleague Ben Gillespie (Pablo Schreiber of ""Den of Thieves"") not recommended him. Sawyer lavishes praise on the safety features of the Pearl. Nobody but Zhao resides in the building. At the last minute, Sarah and Will's kids take up temporary residence on the 96th floor. After Will delivers his briefing, Zhao gives him a biometrically-encoded tablet which enables him to control the Pearl's sophisticated high-tech security systems, including its fire suppression procedures. Suddenly, events take a dramatic turn for the worse. Shortly after he departs from this conference with Zhao, Sawyer grapples with a thug who steals the bag he was carrying. Afterward, Ben is appalled to learn the bag didn't contain the tablet, so he pulls a gun on his old friend. A knockdown, drag-out fight ensues. Before Will can escape with the tablet, one of Botha's minions, Xia (Hannah Quinlivan of ""The Shanghai Job""), intercepts him, confiscates the tablet, and cancels the Pearl's fire response systems. Everybody gets the mistaken idea that Will had double-crossed Zhao. Specifically, the Hong Kong Police launch a manhunt for our hero as smoke and flame erupt from the skyscraper. Inspector Wu (Byron Mann of ""Street Fighter"") dispatches uniformed police to arrest Will, but he is puzzled when Will scales the heights of the Pearl via a high-rise crane to enter the flaming edifice and rescue his family. Indeed, the Rock's heroic leap defies gravity, otherwise the movie would have ended abruptly had he plunged to his death. 
Despite its gravity-defying feats, ""Skyscraper"" constitutes just another tall tale. First, although the villains are appropriately cold-blooded, Thurber has neglected to flesh them out beyond one-dimensional stereotypes. ""Die Hard"" remains memorable as much for Bruce Willis' intrepid feats as the hero as Alan Rickman's audacious antics as his adversary. As the chief villain, Danish actor Roland Møller not only looks fierce as treacherous Scandinavian terrorist Kores Botha, but he also has an ingenious plan. Unfortunately, the Rock dwarfs Botha in both intelligence and size. Thurber should have enhanced Møller's malice. Ironically, one of Botha's subordinates, Xia, qualifies as a more noteworthy villain, since she frames our hero efficiently for the inferno. Naturally, Johnson emerges as a thoroughly sympathetic protagonist, driven without a thought for his own safety to save his family from a fiery death while contending with heavily-armed homicidal antagonists in the tallest skyscraper on record. Second, the object of all this skullduggery is a tiny computer chip. This chip contains incredibly damaging information about Botha's terrorist colleagues that Zhao endeavors to use against them. One of Johnson's best lines sums up ""Skyscraper"": ""If you can't fix it with duct tape... you ain't using enough duct tape."" Comparatively, ""Skyscraper"" could have benefited with more duct tape in the form of cunning villains.",Skyscraper

I wasn't foolish enough to go in there with high expectations; in fact, I had very low expectations for this movie--so I guess it lived up to my expectations. I don't think I'd be giving anything away if I told you it has a weak plot with a lot of shooting, fighting, and death defying stunts. I think the trailers give away all you need to know. Some mega rich Chinese man built the world's tallest building in Hong Kong. Although it is super-secure it has been compromised by bad guys. Will Sawyer's (Dwayne Johnson) family is in danger within said high rise so he will put all of his skills to use to save them. One death-defying stunt after another, some fighting, some running, some timely luck, and some ingenuity, then mercifully and ending.It's nothing that you haven't seen already. In fact, the first thing I thought about with the scene being a skyscraper was Die Hard. Well, this doesn't even halfway compare to Die Hard.

20,neil-476,Action packed but predictable.,7,13 July 2018,"Will Sawyer, having lost half a leg at the end of his police career, is a security consultant, tasked with auditing the security systems of new mega-skyscraper The Pearl in Hong Kong prior to its opening. Wouldn't you know it, there is a fire which traps Will's wife and kids above the fireline. And, wouldn't you know it, scheming baddies have turned off the computerised fire control system.This film bolts The Towering Inferno (remember that one, kiddies?) onto Die Hard, and throws in the climax of Enter The Dragon. Dwayne Johnson does action hero for all he's worth and, in this movie, that's quite a lot.I can't remember a film which was quite as predictable as this one. In the first five minutes there is mention of a particular character and I thought the way he was mentioned telegraphed his purpose in the plot. Yes, spot on. You know there will be a bit where the artificial leg will come in handy, and so on. The building appears to be designed to create as much jeopardy for Sawyer as possible (really? You'd keep the security for the penthouse THERE?). Johnson cops the usual selection of battering and wounds which would put a lesser man in hospital but, hey, his kids are in danger, and his son has asthma (to be fair, they didn't milk that one to the extent I thought they would.Neve Campbell - yes, she's still around - as wife Sarah has a nice line in giving as good as she gets - I enjoyed that, and would have liked to see it used a bit more. The visuals are terrific, but the problem is that there is minimal sense of jeopardy no matter how great it looks. And this isn't helped by Sawyer's invulnerability especially in the face of the preposterous feats he performs during the movie.It's entertaining enough, but it's as dumb as the proverbial box of frogs.",Skyscraper
21,Wizard-8,"Merely okay ""Die Hard"" / ""Towering Inferno"" clone",6,1 December 2018,"Probably the reason why ""Skyscraper"" underperformed at the domestic box office was that the two genres it uses and mixes together - the ""Die Hard"" formula and also the disaster film formula - have been previously done to death, and don't have any spark of interest to many moviegoers. There are additional problems with the movie's script that probably turned away other moviegoers as well. The script has a number of telegraphed plot turns that you'll see coming a mile away. Also, the movie surprisingly takes a lot of time to get to the meat of the movie, with actor Dwayne Johnson taking more than 40% of the running time to get into the title structure to do his thing. And when he does get inside, doubtless many viewers will be disappointed that there is far less of him fighting the bad guys than you might think. Still, Johnson is appealing and likable as always, the movie is never boring despite it taking its sweet time in the first half, the special effects are pretty good, and there is some excitement here and there. Although you would be better off rewatching the original ""Die Hard"" or ""Towering Inferno"", if you don't mind seeing the same two formulas again, and are willing to lower your expectations by a few notches, the movie does pass the time in a kind of okay fashion.",Skyscraper
22,FlashCallahan,'You got any duct tape?'........,8,19 July 2018,"Former FBI Hostage Rescue Team leader Will Sawyer now assesses security for skyscrapers, particularly very tall ones. He's on assignment in China when he finds the tallest, safest building in the world he's approved, suddenly ablaze, and a sub Gruber gang of criminals have a motivation......and it's money of course.... Will must find those responsible, clear his name and somehow rescue his family, whom are trapped inside the building, above the fire line......Diescraper or Skyhard, yes, this film has lots of comparisons to my favourite film of all time 'Die Hard', but thankfully, this isn't a remake or a reboot of any sort. In fact, it references 'The Towering Inferno', 'Daylight', and even science fiction's monolithic ham sandwich, 'Total Recall' (1990).so we have a cold opening, which comfortably explains the prosthesis, and then we fast forward a few years later, and Johnson is now married to Neve Campbell, who thankfully hasn't had any trouble from psycho horror buffs in a long time.After a lot of foreshadowing, and playing spot the bad guy from the dirty look, the action soon 'heats' up.But before we get to the main event, we have a small subplot in which Johnson may or may not be responsible for the blaze, and he's chased from the rejected extras from the the third xXx movie.After a quick motorcycle chase, and a wonderful set piece involving the controversial one shot poster with the crane, the film spends almost the rest of the film in the warm comfort of the burning building.As ironic as it sounds, In a world where cinemas are crammed with franchises, Superheroes, and low budget jump scare horrors, it's refreshing to see an out and out action film that throws you right into the action, and never lets up until the very end.You really have to take a heavy pinch of salt with the film, as said before, the foreshadowing is monumentally stupid, you may as well have Writer/Director Thurber in the corner of the screen saying 'see this? Well remember this for later' with a bid silly wink.But when we have Sawyer risking his life in ever sillier situations, you will find your palms sweaty, teeth being clenched, and I uttered profanity under my breath a few times.even though the fundamental element of the film, the maguffin, is laughable, and the fact that Sawyer is a family man at heart, and it doesn't take a cinematic genius to figure out the outcome, it offers thrills in droves, over the top bad guys, defies logic, and the fact that Johnson makes you feel like a worthless father (Because no real human being would survive anything he does), it's such a fun time to have.And the best thing about this film, not once during this film did I compare it to Die Hard.Stupid, logic defying, and bonkers, but so entertaining.",Skyscraper

The setting in one of these super tall buildings in Hong Kong is perfect. The photography is good - everything that happens feels quite real. The story is well written - little things tie up and it the plot doesn't get unnecessarily convoluted like some thrillers of today. The Rock is quite something here playing a handicapped character who can do so much.Neve Campbell makes a welcome return to the big screen. Her character has a good role here - she is smart looking and is definitely not just a damsel in distress.Catch this on the big screen if you haven't already.,Skyscraper
24,Aaron1375,About on par with his earlier 2018 flick Rampage,7,9 November 2018,"Basically, this film was nothing super fantastic; however, it was a good popcorn action film where one tends to have to turn off their brain because there is a lot of stuff that makes no sense contained within. That being said, I thought this one was a lot better than the more familiar Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom also brought to us by Universal studios. This one cannot be called original though as it is pretty much Die Hard with a bit of Towering Inferno mixed in, or is it Towering Inferno with a bit of Die Hard mixed in? One can never tell as the film shifts quite a bit too.The story has a man who was in some sort of special forces or something having a very bad encounter. That bad encounter though leads to him to meet his wife with whom he has two kids with who are his everything. He is doing some sort of security detail on a state of the art skyscraper set up by one of his buddies from when he was in the special forces and things begin to seem off. Turns out the skyscraper is being targeted by some group who wishes to get something within and to burn the building down around the one who designed it. With his family inside, Will (Rock's character) tries to get in so that he can save them.The rock is good and so are most of the characters, the film could have been a bit better with more action within the burning building. So much of the action consists of Will trying to get into the building or outside on the glass trying to maneuver to a certain point. The whole point of the people setting the building ablaze is a bit disappointing too as they keep withholding that info and then when you learn what it was, not that big a deal.So, the film did have some good action here and there and some good Rock action too, but it could've used some more. Rampage felt like a big budget film mixed with b movie elements and this one just seems like it is missing some ingredient. I also have to think that this film was sponsored by duct tape as it was featured quite a bit in this one and it began to seem almost odd.",Skyscraper

It was the marketing that did it; a throwback to The Towering Inferno and Die Hard with the one guy that seems capable of pulling off such a heroic role.But The Rock's muscle-bound fount of charisma is very nearly wasted here - on an underdeveloped role and in a blandly generic action movie.

Sounds familiar? Only difference between Die Hard and Skyscraper is that instead of using Bruce Willis' charm and suicidal tendencies, we get The Rock's ""smoldering intensity"" and muscles. Oh, and there is a lot of Chinese in there, for pandering purposes. What they completely missed out on is a Christmas theme and release date. Suckers!Now, the cast was pretty fun. The Rock, Neve Campbell, Chin han, Byron Mann, Hitler, even that cute Chinese psycho hitman. The script was mediocre and completely predictable, though.

It stars The Rock (Dwayne Johnson) as a former FBI agent, and amputee, who must rescue his family from terrorists in a Hong Kong skyscraper. The movie was directed, written and produced by Rawson Marshall Thurber (who also directed and co-wrote 2016's 'CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE', also starring The Rock). The movie also costars Neve Campbell, Chin Han, Roland Møller, Noah Taylor, Byron Mann and Pablo Schreiber. It's gotten mixed to positive reviews from critics, and it's expected to do well at the Box Office as well. I found it to be mildly enjoyable. 
 
Will Taylor (Johnson) is a former FBI Hostage Rescue Team leader, who was injured on an assignment and lost one of his legs. He now works as a security inspector for skyscrapers. While inspecting a newly built Hong Kong skyscraper, the building he's assigned is taken over by terrorists, and his wife (Campbell) and children are taken hostage. Will must return to action mode once again, in order to save them. The movie starts out really promising, it reminded me of a classic 'DIE HARD' ripoff from the 90s. Then it turns into a more cheesy routine potential blockbuster though, that we're used to seeing from The Rock these days. I used to really like him as a leading man, and action hero, but lately he's not impressive to me in the slightest. I did think 'CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE' was pretty funny though; this film is mostly just a bore. It has it's moments though, especially in the beginning.",Skyscraper

Well, that and it's also part Poseidon Adventure and Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol. There are zero surprises and the story is so A-B-C, I'm shocked if the screenplay was longer than the cocktail napkin it no doubt was first conceived on.That said, the Rock is always giving his 100% and some tense moments for me almost made a recommendation. I have an extreme fear of heights, so green screen or not, some of the scenes were pretty intense for me.But, like I said, it wasn't a recommendation.

Still, it has its moments.",5,22 July 2018,"There isn't a single thing in 'Skyscraper (2018)' that hasn't been done (essentially better) before, both on a micro and macro level. This leads to an experience entirely devoid of surprise and, by extension, suspense. It also doesn't do itself any favours by drawing direct comparisons to, among other things, 'Die Hard (1988)' in its own marketing, a movie this would fail to live up to even if it wasn't the classic masterpiece it is. Why on Earth the filmmakers decided to ape some very specific set-pieces from some very specifically (famously so) non-CGI, stunt-heavy and essentially as 'real' as possible pictures but recreate them entirely digitally with our hero shot against a green screen is anyone's guess. The end result - and it's bizarrely over-serious facade - is as plain as day, though. This is clearly a film akin to last night's takeaway meal - reheated, unfulfilling and entirely forgettable. However, it's just 'original' enough to count as an 'original film', something rarer and rarer in Hollywood these days. While it can be passively entertaining at times, if this is the sort of stuff we get, we're in trouble. 5/10",Skyscraper
32,bowmanblue,"Yeah, could have been better",6,9 October 2018,"I'm a big fan of Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, so when I saw the trailer for 'Skyscraper' I - like sooo many others - figured they were effectively remaking 'Die Hard' for the modern age, i.e. terrorists seize control of a high rise building and only one man stands in the way of their diabolical plans. I'm no fan of remakes, seeing they're everywhere these days, but I figured having The Rock in the 'John McClane' role would make the film at least a good, fun, popcorn type film. Then I started reading the reviews when the film came out.To be blunt, most critics (and even the fans) weren't that impressed, saying it was an average affair at best. Many times a film has received mainly negative criticism I've had my expectations suitably lowered enough to find it actually wasn't as bad as I'd been led to believe and found myself having a good time watching it. However, here the general consensus is kind of bang on the money.Dwayne Johnson plays an FBI agent who's wounded in the line of duty and loses a leg, forcing him into the civilian life of selling high-tech security systems. Therefore, it's quite a big gig for him when he's chosen to test the security of the world's most state of the art building in China. However, as I've already mentioned, terrorists seize control of it, just when his family (Neve Campbell - who it is genuinely nice to see back on the big screen again in something other than a 'Scream' movie! - and their two children) are visiting, forcing him to save the day.Now, from that brief plot synopsis, you could be mistaken for thinking, 'Yup, that sounds just like 'Die Hard.' In fact, if they had simply remade 'Die Hard' with The Rock in it, it would probably have been better than what we actually got. In 'Die Hard' John McClane was alone and constantly under threat from the terrorists infesting the building. Here, the terrorists are only half of the problem. It's not 'The Rock vs Baddies' - it's actually The Rock vs the building and occasionally a henchman with a gun. Many scenes feel like you're watching a computer game where Johnson has to jump from moving platform and avoiding obstacles while swinging on ropes to avoid fires. I know no hero ever really dies or is in any real danger until the final act (maybe), but there really isn't much in the way of feeling any real sense of danger from anything that happens.Plus you have Johnson's family to deal with. As I say, if it was him vs the terrorists then it might be a faster-paced affair, but the film keeps dwelling on his family, whether they're in danger inside the building, or attempting to prove his innocence from the side-lines. The terrorists are faceless baddies at best. There's no 'Hans Gruber' character who provides a true nemesis to our hero and you won't even remember any antagonist's name, let alone why he's doing what he is.Overall, 'Skyscraper' tries to make too much out of a simple premise. The reason 'Die Hard' worked so well was because it was a simple action story. Here, you have too many plot elements all competing for screen time in a film that isn't overly-long to begin with. I still love all Dwayne Johnson's films and will continue to watch everything he's in, however this really is a dip in the quality of his action catalogue. Pity - could have been much better if it stuck to action through and through.",Skyscraper
33,ThomasDrufke,Skyhard,7,22 July 2018,"Listen, Skyscraper isn't Die Hard, nor is it as good as any of the last few F&F movies. But it does fall somewhere in the middle of those. At this point in his career I will see anything The Rock does and even with how similar some of the characters he plays are, you know he always gives 110% to every performance. In Skyscraper, he plays an amputee war veteran who does everything in his power to save his family from a burning skyscraper. Cliched? Yes. Too much like Die Hard and San Andreas? Perhaps. But as I always say, a film that's enjoyable -no matter how cliche-, is a film worth seeing. I think the reason something like this didn't do well at the domestic box office could be a few different things. One has to assume that the lack of secondary acting talent would have something to do with it. All of the performances were good, but none are going to draw a huge crowd. Heck, this film doesn't even have a great villain to counter The Rock's presence. Roland Møller is perfectly fine, but he certainly never demands your attention like Johnson does. Even still, the cinematography done by Robert Elswit is a thing of beauty. There were moments of genuine aw as Elswit did his best to keep you on the edge of your seat atop a building. Heck, even the CGI was great, and I was certainly not expecting that. It's not exactly the movie of the summer, but I had a lot of fun and was never bored.

36,CuriosityKilledShawn,The Boring Inferno,1,10 March 2020,"Dwayne Johnson has a knack for choosing the absolute worst scripts floating around Hollywood. He's apparently the new Arnold but none of his movies have the quality that Schwarzenegger gave us during his peak. In the 80s and for much of the 90s, Arnold gave us several classics and genre icons such as Conan, Terminator 1 and 2, Commando, Predator, The Running Man, Total Recall, even Last Action Hero in retrospect. Virtually ALL of Johnson's career has been low-culture trash, and most of his movies are green screen nightmares. Has this man ever even left Los Angeles when filming these forgettable bores?Taking much of its inspiration from The Towering Inferno, the movie has Johnson as an ex-FBI type who is now the head of security at the world's tallest building in China (a market that movies of very low quality consistently pander to). When terrorists set fire to the structure in an act of revenge he must get inside and save his family who are trapped above the fire. It takes over an hour for this to happen. The movie is 102 minutes long, including credits.The thing about The Towering Inferno, and other movies from that era, is that once the effects become dated and bettered by more recent movies the weaknesses in the script become more apparent. At the very least, that movie had double literary merit, adapted from two separate novels. It also had a star-studded cast (for the time) and had a hefty 165-minute running time that capably builds tension. Dated it may well be, but it still stands (even if ablaze), and is a far superior film to the imaginatively-titled Skyscraper.If you are going to hand a $120,000,000 budget to a director so he can make a blockbuster disaster movie then obviously the money is in the safe hands of the man who gave us Dodgeball. The script is so sloppy, disjointed, badly-paced, utterly illogical, cliche-ridden, and predictable. Rawson Marshall Thurber (a descendant of one of Bambi's forest friends) just. does. not. have the talent to make this exciting or the writing ability to give us anything other than an assembly of heavily-used tropes. He didn't research a damn thing and bolted this junk together from what he's seen in other movies. Real world physics, rules, procedures, accuracies, and human logic are not elements that are woven into his illiterate marmalade. Much of it seems to be directly lifted from Lupin the 3rd: Farewell to Nostradamus, infinitely more exciting than this junk.There is an excessive amount of establishing scenes which build to nothing. The opening raid is pointless, and the resulting injury on poor Mr. Johnson doesn't justify it. Having your lead character be an amputee (who is seemingly just as able-bodied as he used to be) is not an instant weakness to counterbalance his muscles and brute force. It's so lazy and contrived I felt like shouting ""how dare you"" at the screen. Mr. Johnson (I refuse to refer to these ""characters"" by their names as they are all irrelevant) is naturally framed for the arson because Thurber needs an easy excuse to add more difficulty and obstacles to pad the running time. With no help from the police he must get into the building on his own and does so by climbing a self-erecting crane, not even up the ladder but by hauling himself up the steel frame...with one leg.The fire is on the 96th floor. He climbs, more on less, 100 floors worth of crane without his muscles locking up, without getting out of breath, in unbreakable record time...with one leg. There's no excitement here, he might as well be Superman. Imagine if Steve McQueen did that in The Towering Inferno! It also amazes me that no matter how far up these characters go they are rarely buffeted by the wind unless the plot calls for it. I work in a six-floor building and the penthouse sounds like the sound design for Twister. Obviously the lazy production design forgot to add giant fans to sit beside the excessive green screens.It infrequently cuts to a side story involving a beautiful woman who is in on the heist, but it's completely benign and adds nothing. If you took this away, removed the opening scene, and had Mr. Johnson get into the building a little sooner the movie would have lasted about 87 minutes. If you were to also remove the pointless scenes involving the utterly, utterly useless Hong Kong police then we're doing to about 79 minutes. Nothing in this movie serves the story, rather it's just all a tiresome excuse to make the next ""thing"" happen.Can someone explain how Mr. Johnson who is Samoan, Black Canadian, and a bit Irish, and Neve Campbell (purely white) have children darker-skinned than them? Or are they adopted? I don't even care. They're not even characters, just blocks in Thurber's Lego Duplo stack of plastic. ""Look, Mommy, I made a skyscraper.""A lot of the dialogue is delivered off-camera or with the character's mouth movements hidden. The cynic in me thinks that this is a lazy attempt at making foreign market dubbing (particularly China) more accommodating. This is such a horrible example of artless corporate filmmaking by a talentless hack.Dwayne Johnson needs to distance himself from these desperate blockbusters and start choosing his projects with more care. His name does not guarantee quality, not by a million miles.This movie has no soul and should be abandoned into the dark, inescapable void into which Thurber looks for inspiration.",Skyscraper

40,The-Sarkologist,Quite Breathtaking,6,14 July 2018,"Okay, there is one thing that really stands out with this film and that is 'the jump'. You know, the one where he appears to be making this absolutely impossible jump from the end of a crane into a massively tall skyscraper, the one that pretty much defies all the laws of physics (as if that has stopped Hollywood in the past), and the one that when you look at the poster you pretty much shake your head and what for the inevitable splat on the ground. Like seriously, do you really think he is not going to make that jump - come on, it's Dwayne Johnson, and we already know that he is not only going to be the good guy, but he is going to make it to the end.
 So, is this just a reboot of Die Hard? Well, sort of. Okay, we do have the terrorists take over the building cliché, and the cop stuck in the building cliché, except that he isn't actually stuck in the building when they take over because well, there is that jump. However, I'd probably say that there is also a lot of Towering Inferno in this film as well because in Die Hard the building wasn't on fire. Another thing is that Die Hard was nowhere near as tense as this film was, with the heights and all that. Sure, Die Hard was in a tall building, but not as tall as this one.
 Yeah, I know, actually we all know that Dwayne Johnson is going to survive, get the bad guys, and be made the hero, even though we also have the 'cops think he is the perpetrator' cliché here as well. However, even though we know all of that, we simply cannot help but hold in our breath as all of this goes down, especially with crawling along the edges of a burning building, and the fact that one slip is basically bye bye Dwayne. Oh, and having an artificial leg also adds to the tension, so I'll give it that as well. Okay, maybe Die Hard was pretty tense at times, but honestly, I never held my breath in Die Hard as much as I held it in this film.
 Okay, the film is pretty standard in what you have with such films, and we all know how it is going to end, but it actually turned out to be much better than I actually expected. Honestly, the only reason I went and saw this movie was because my brother wanted to see it, and I was also putting it off somewhat. However, as it turned out, it actually wasn't all that bad. However, let's move on from the 'copy of Die Hard' trope and instead describe it as 'Towering Inferno meets Die Hard'.",Skyscraper

Either way, people definitely manage through the extreme. The plot is a little disorienting mostly about safety, enormous buildings, sacrifices, and rigorously risking themselves in many situations.

43,paulclaassen,Another disappointing Dwayne Johnson movie...yawn...,4,10 September 2018,"Yawn. Oh, its review time! Well, this was (yet another) disappointing Dwayne Johnson film. 'The Towering Inferno' meets 'Die Hard' - only less believable. Uhm, in fact nothing about this film was believable and there was nothing original about it. The Korean film 'The Tower' was much better! The film is fast-paced, but there are just too many narrow escapes and close calls to make it believable - a typical Hollywood flaw. They tried so hard to make it incredible that they ruined the reality. There are also way too many conveniences, which I won't even go into. Hollywood never learns. A film like this should be kept plain and simple with the call to adventure the fight to survive and escape the inferno. But no, they have to over-complicate it with too much information, set-ups and twists. There's so much about the 'explanation' about why this is happening that doesn't make sense. I played this explanation scene back four times and still couldn't make sense of it all. The acting also wasn't great. 'Skyscraper' was as unoriginal as it comes, not to mention very cheesy.

Since he is the security expert for this building he knows what has to be done in order not only to save his family but the building as well.I liked this movie because it had a simple but interesting plot, many good action scenes, and a very good direction. I enjoyed also this movie because it's a good disaster movie that knows its audience and it knows what its audience wants to watch. About the direction which was made by Rawson Marshall Thurber, I found it very good and I enjoyed the visual effects of it. Regarding the interpretations, I have to admit that I had high expectations from Dwayne Johnson who played as Will Sawyer and I was happily surprised since he wasn't just good but he was simply outstanding. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Neve Campbell's who played as Sarah Sawyer, Roland Møller's who played as Kores Botha and Chin Han's who played as Zhao Long Ji.In conclusion, I have to say that ""Skyscraper"" is a nice and interesting movie to watch, with many good action scenes and some good interpretations made by its cast. If you have already watched and enjoyed ""San Andreas"" then I am definitely sure that you are going to enjoy this movie too. I recommend everyone to watch this movie because I am sure that you are going to enjoy it and you are going to have fun.",Skyscraper
45,cruise01,A fun summer blockbuster which has no logic but is one exciting thrill ride.,10,14 July 2018,"Skyscraper (5 out of 5 stars). Skyscraper is an adrenaline rush thrill ride that will put you on the edge of your seat until the closing credits. It is one of those fun blockbuster movies that are big, loud, and plenty of dumb fun. Some may think that it is a rip off from Die Hard. Which may be similar in a way. You have Dwayne Johnson running around the building, trying to save his family from a group of paramilitary bad guys and escape from the burning building. But it tries to be its own genre action film. And it delivers. The plot is simple. It follows a former FBI agent Will (Dwayne Johnson) after a hostage situation gone wrong. That leaves him being an amputee victim and meeting a military medic Sarah (Neve Campbell) who becomes his wife. 10 years later, Will works for a security assessment company for the tallest skyscraper on the planet known as ""the pearl."" His family is the first to live in the tallest structure. When a group of bad guys infiltrate the building. Causing an explosion that will take over the building. Will is going to stop at nothing to get back into the building to save his family. There is more to the plot. Like a plot device were the bad guys are after something from the building's owner. And there is a predictable twist with good guys being bad. It is easy to see coming just cause they act shady to begin with. The film waste no time in getting the action started. There is plenty of exciting action sequences. And some of those sequences has no laws of physics in play. Definitely, a blockbuster movie were you have to leave logic and brains outside the theatre. It is exciting and fun. For the action genre enthusiast, this is a film for you. Dwayne Johnson plays a former amputee agent. He does take a beating from the bad guys. But gets back up and has one hell of a punch. He climbs a crane with the chinese law enforcement chasing him. He jumps off the crane to the building. He fights some more. He does some death defying climbing besides the building and making some leaps that are a second away from falling. Dwayne Johnson delivers with the role. Playing a loving father and will stop at nothing to save his family. He is a great action movie star. Neve Campbell is good too. It is nice to see her back on screen (can not remember seeing her in any other movie besides the Scream movies). Roland Moller was good as the villain. Not sure if he ever plays the good guy in any other movie. Chin Han was good too as the pearl owner. The visual effects are top notch awesome. Breathtaking in some scenes when Dwayne Johnson is on the ledge or close to falling. Director/writer Rawson Marshall Thurber did great delivering an action packed, loud, and exciting film. Which is off from his genre of choice. When he does comedic films like Dodgeball, Were the Millers, or the lackluster Central Intelligence. Overall, Skyscraper is an awesome great film. Dwayne Johnson and the cast delivers. The action is fast paced and does not stop with the thrills until it finishes. And the visual effects are intense. It is trying to be its own film with the similarities of older action movies like Die Hard or The Towering Inferno.",Skyscraper
46,Floated2,Quite generic but watchable,5,9 April 2019,"Skyscraper- the latest action blockbuster starring The Rock. In a role in where he's the everyday family man likable hero, which he has played many times before. This film is quite visually stunning considering its big budget but it is slightly more serious than expected.Also quite dumb in certain ways. In the trailers it does not show that Dwayne Johnson's character has lost one leg so when he are introduced to it, it does come as a surprise. This was quite a good touch in a sense. His character is shown to be quite strong and able to walk in scenes where his leg comes apart.Besides some decent action scenes, this film isn't all that great. Having being compared to Die Hard, mainly due to its ""hostage/locked in"" plot, there isn't that many similarities from the two. This is more of a family friendly action film than anything else.There is one scene where we see him climb the side of the building (even with his leg coming off), without hardly breaking a sweat. And another where he makes a large leap from the crane to the building. Somewhat unrealistic action sequences.Overall this film is watchable for the cast including Neve Campbell, and some action, but other than nothing really completely worthwhile. There is also not much suspense or thrills as one expected as we all know the Rock and his family will end up surviving in the end.",Skyscraper
47,leonblackwood,Terribble storyline with decent CGI! 3/10,3,6 January 2019,"Review:
How unrealistic is this movie! I really think this movie went way too far, in terms of a one-legged man jumping across buildings during a blazing fire, and the fact that he used to be a war hero and he hasn't got any combat skills whatsoever, just made the film a terrible watch. The enemy went way too far to get what he wanted, and it amazed me how the crowd was hanging around at the bottom of a really tall building when it's on fire. On top of that, the police didn't call in the Special Ops because they were completely useless, and no one questioned why people were getting shot all over the place. Basically, the storyline had too many holes, and the pathetic ending just made me question why the hell they didn't rethink the storyline. On the plus side, it does look quite good, and some of the action scenes were half decent but I really wasn't impressed with the over-exaggerated plot. Anyway, U.S. Marine War veteran and retired FBI Hostage Rescue Team leader, Will Sawyer (Dwayne Johnson) now assesses security for skyscrapers after an incident that caused him to lose one of his legs. He is currently reviewing ""The Pearl"", a newly-constructed 225-story skyscraper in Hong Kong for financier Zhang Long Ji (Chin Han). During his asasessment, his family - wife Sarah (Neve Campbell), and twins Georgia (McKenna Roberts) and Henry (Noah Cottrell) have resided in the not-yet-opened residential floors. Will meets up with Zhang's security team, which includes his old friend and fellow ex-FBI agent Ben Gillespie (Pablo Schreiber). Will reports the computerised security systems are all secure but he needs to inspect the offsite security centre. Zhang provides him with a locked tablet with facial recognition that gives him complete control over the computerised systems in the Pearl. After the meeting, Ben and Will travel to the offsite location, but en route a thief, hired by Kores Botha (Roland Meller), an international terrorist, attempts to steal the tablet. After getting stabbed in the arm, Ben takes Will back to his place to patch him up. Will tells Ben that he still has the tablet on him, and Ben explains to Will that he is working for Botha and that Botha will kill him if he doesn't get it. They then have a brawl in his flat, and Will ends up killing Ben. While Will attempts to get back to the Pearl, the tablet is stolen by Xia (Hannah Quinlivan), one of Botha's associates. Xia and her agents attack the offsite centre, killing all of the guards, and then hack the tablet to bypass its facial security and disable the fire extinguishing systems in the upper half of the Pearl. Meanwhile, Botha and a group of his men break into the Pearl and start a fire on the 96th floor. With the fire getting worse and Will's family trapped inside, he tries his utmost to get to his family, but Inspector Wu (Byron Mann) believes that Will is behind the incidents, and tries to capture him. Now from here, the movie goes haywire. The one-legged hero managed to slip past the police and miraculously gets inside the Pearl via construction equipment from a neighbouring building. I'm not going to bore you with the details about the rest of the plot, but guess what, the Rock saves the day again, even though he has one leg and his family are running around in a burning building. I usually say that the concept was good but the director badly executed it, but in this case, it was an extremely bad storyline from the beginning. The terrorist, Botha had been coercing and intimidating Zhang throughout the construction of the Pearl with money laundering, but Zhang kept a detailed log of the various transactions, information that would be dire to Botha if it became public, so he was causing complete havoc just for that. Seriously! I'm sure there were easier ways of sorting out the problem, like for instants, killing Zhang. Anyway, I wasn't that impressed with the film, but I did find some of the locations pretty amazing. The CGI was also pretty good, which made it seem like he was really jumping across a burning building with his one leg, but apart from that, it's definitely not in the same class as Die Hard, which was made in 1988 and they didn't have the CGI that we have nowadays. Regardless of what I think, the movie still made a profit at the box office and it didn't tarnish the Rocks career, even though he produced it. That just proves that his name is making people flock to the cinemas, but the vulnerable Rock in this movie just didn't do it for me. Disappointing!Round-Up:
This movie was written and directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber, who also brought you Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story, The Mysteries of Pittsburgh, We're The Millers, which I enjoyed and Central Intelligence which also starred the Rock in the lead. There is a planned We're the Millers 2 but there isn't any sign of Skyscraper 2, maybe because it didn't go down to well with critics. People were saying that it was too close to the Towering Inferno, and of course Die Hard but the cliched script really let it down, which I totally agree with. As for the Rock, he is due to star in Suicide Squad 2, as Black Adam, and a remake of Big Trouble In Little China, which is a bit worrying. There is also going to be a Black Adam movie, which is in production as we speak, and a San Andreas 2 is in development. After the success of the Jumanji movie, there is also going to be a sequel, so he has definitely got his hands full over the next few years. I just hope he shows a different side to his acting because I'm getting a bit fed up with seeing him save the world time and time again.Budget: $125million

48,TheMovieDiorama,Skyscraper allows Johnson to tower over a script that doesn't set this superstructure on fire.,6,13 July 2018,"There are films so stupid yet serious that the implausibility of any situation leaves a sour aftertaste. Conversely, there are films that relish in its improbability and cranks up its self-awareness to colossal heights. Skyscraper is just that. Absolutely bonkers. Zero believability. Yet, contagiously entertaining throughout. A former agent must rescue his family from the tallest building in the world after terrorists set it alight. Think 'Die Hard' meets 'The Towering Inferno'. Obviously not as revolutionary as the former but there is buoyancy to this action film. Writer/Director Thurber allows the film to acknowledge its own preposterous scenarios. Whether it be an amputee sprinting across a crane and leaping into a fiery structure (ridiculously brilliant) or using duct tape to traverse the exterior edges of the skyscraper in order to advance further (even more ridiculously brilliant). It's such an infectious sense of popcorn entertainment, you end up just rolling with it. Let's all lighten up a tad! It's not trying to be significant or monumental. Just derivative blockbusting fun. Johnson's charisma elevates his already eternal likability to gargantuan heights. He is the father you always wanted. The man can tackle any subject matter and make it amusing. It's a testament to his star power. Great to see Campbell and Han have some screen prominence also. The skyscraper's modernistic architecture was pleasant and encapsulated contemporary design very well. The 80s/90s action essence is there, however Thurber's script doesn't utilise it fully. The cheesy one liners are present but the abundance of exposition results in the dialogue becoming functional rather than developed. The villain was generic, although I would argue the focus is on Johnson saving his family, and it's conclusion was slightly underwhelming. But despite the glaring criticisms, it's another pleasing blockbuster from Johnson who ensures this tower rises above other average action films. Just don't expect blazing revolutionary thrills.",Skyscraper

51,southdavid,Sky-scraping The Barrel,4,16 August 2018,"Contrived, would be my one word review of ""Skyscraper"". But that's probably not going to cut it, so I'll write some more. The Rock plays Will Sawyer, a former FBI tactical officer, who has become a private security appraiser following a failed hostage rescue that results in him losing a lower limb. Several years after the incident, Will is asked by one of his former colleagues (Pablo Schrieber) to appraise the security of ""The Pearl"", the partially opened new tallest building in the world, built in Hong Kong by Chinese Billionaire Zhao Long Ji (Chin Han). Naturally, terrorists invade and Sawyer must somehow re-enter a building on lockdown (and fire) to rescue his family trapped on the higher floors. Derivative, would the second word I'd add to a two word review of ""Skyscraper"". ""Die Hard"" is an obvious inspiration. As DJ breaks windows and swings out holding on to a thin rope and crashes into the windows further down. The villains are all Eastern European, for some reason, with the exception of Noah Taylor, who provides the English Baddie quota. The film also borrows liberally from the Mission Impossible sequence when Tom Cruise climbs on the outside of the Skyscraper. It's inferior to both of these films though. The Contrivance is difficult to explain without some spoilers so I'll just say there are two scenes ""Turn it off and on again"" and ""Inside the Pearl"" that couldn't be more ""I AM FORESHADOWING HOW THE FILM WILL END"" if they'd literally put that in subtitles on the screen and Dwayne had raised an eyebrow into the camera. It also all revolves around one character not going to Interpol straight away, with masses of evidence they have, and having all the criminal element in the film locked up before they can invade...but OK. The Rock is as likable as ever, though I'm not sure I really bought his relationship with his wife (It's nice to see Neve Campbell getting non-Scream roles though). I'd have thought relationships between people and surgeons who worked on them would by and large be frowned upon, but whatever. Generally the CGI is pretty good, though the same can't be said for the director's choices when it came to framing and editing the fight sequences, they are truly awful. Everything is shot far too tight and editing too choppily, it's a blurry mess. Hackneyed and sorely lacking in originality, ""Skyscraper"" is not worth your time.",Skyscraper

At least I know what I am gonna get: continuous action with a dumb story.No jokes this time around, because Dwayne acts seriously in this movie.Yes, he really can act "" seriously"". And I dont miss the jokes too much. The only thing that is really boring and annoying are the cheap CGI effects. Why do they do that? There are lots of good CGI stunts as well, but many many more silly looking CGI effects. CGI saves money. It is cheaper to blow up a building with CGI effects than to do it for real. ""Die Hard"" (1988) blew everything up for real and that is part of the fun of that action classic. This movie is a cheap copy of ""Die Hard"" (1988) though. But it is still mindless dumb FUN. Beats staring at the wallpaper for me anyhow...The story: Dwayne Johnson wants to rescue his family from a skyscraper, invaded by bad guys. Will he succeed?

A humongous skyscraper in flames, a lone hero fighting his way through the flames to stop the bad guys. Hostages, gun fights, collapsing floors. All that good stuff. Unfortunately, you're constantly reminded that you've seen this exact scenario before. Partly in The Towering Inferno and partly in Die Hard. This movie heavily re-uses the story beats from those two movies and it's now even subtle about it.And sure, you can make movies based on ideas from other movies. But you have to have a voice. You have to add something new. This movie does not.That being said, The Rock was as entertaining as ever. The man has a presence, no matter what he does. Neve Campbell as his wife was also a pleasant surprise. Then again, the villain played by Roland Møller was terribly bland and we didn't learn nearly enough about him.Skyscraper's worst sin is that it's generic.

Instead it was pretty much the opposite of all of those things. 'The Rock' was given almost no opportunity to show off his undeniable charm. The script just hampered him in every way and left him as nothing more than a muscly guy who could do impressive stunts. But trust me, 'The Rock' is the least of the problems this film has.The biggest gripe I have is just how dull it is. The film actually starts off with a pretty menacing villain and some violent and brutal killings. At this stage I had hope for the film, but all of that ended pretty abruptly and from that point onwards every bad guy in the film was unbelievably incompetent. The whole story arc plays out in about as cliche of a fashion as you could ever imagine. It's all very underwhelming and disappointing.As for positives they are hard to come by.

It's more of a dumb down version of Die Hard, the bad guys are played the way you would expect, but one scene does not play the way you think it's gonna, a real wow moment, won't say what scene it is, but you'll know it when you see it.

This is an action movie that is like the ones from the old days of Bruce, Sly and Arnold. In fact, it is kind of like Die Hard meets The Towering Inferno. Maybe they should have called it, 'Towering Hard!' Anyway, Dwayne plays an ex FBI agent/former US war veteran that is hired to check out the security of a new building in Hong Kong-it is being called the world's tallest skyscraper-before it is to open to the public. It's all high tech state of the art. Lots of movies 'borrow' from other movies and this one does several times, which is fine if done properly. There is one scene taken straight out of 'Enter the Dragon', involving mirrors. Neve is Dwayne's wife, who tags along with the kids for a free vacation, as they are going to be the first people to stay in the building. Chin is the owner of the skyscraper and Roland is a terrorist that has plans to disrupt the opening by burning it to the ground-he also wants something else of a more personal note from Chin. If you have seen the trailers, then you know that Dwayne is missing a leg-from his FBI days-which throws something different into the mix.

62,jimbo-53-186511,Seriously? Only a 5.8 IMDB score? You're pulling my leg...,8,29 June 2019,"Will Sawyer (Dwayne Johnson) is a former FBI Agent who retired 10 years ago and has now taken up a job as a security consultant and has relocated to Hong Kong with his wife and 2 children - presumably his decision was partly influenced by life-changing injuries that he suffered just before he quit his job as an FBI Agent. Sawyer has relocated to Hong Kong with his family and is now employed as a security consultant and is thrilled when he learns that he gets the job as chief security advisor at the newly built tallest skyscraper in the world on his doorstep in Hong Kong. However, this dream soon turns into a nightmare when terrorists set fire to the 96th floor whilst Sawyer's family are trapped in the floors above..Skyscraper is one of those films that pretty much wears its heart on its sleeve; narratively it is pretty poor complete with poorly developed villains and a vague storyline. Outside of this though I have to admit that as a spectacle it is fantastic. Rawson Marshall Thurber does a superb job in the director's chair as the film is chocked full of many heart-stopping, pulse-pounding tension filled scenes - I'll admit that my review may be slightly biased as I'm terrified of heights so the scenes showing Johnson clinging for dear life off the edge of the skyscraper on numerous occasions had me grimacing on several occasions.Although Rawson Thurber does a good job as a director he sadly doesn't do quite as good a job with the screenplay (which sadly seems to be a case with a lot of filmmakers who choose to both write and direct their own projects). You feel when watching this film that he knew the narrative was poor and just concentrated on making the film an exciting affair (it's rare that any time goes by when someone isn't in peril, hanging on for dear life or something doesn't explode). To be fair to Thurber this is what the majority of cinema goers look for in a film (excluding the majority of film critics or cinema elitists who seem to demand depth from everything they see). Take my word for it though if you're a normal mortal who likes an exciting cinematic experience and like to be kept on the edge of your seat then I'm pretty confident you'll enjoy this film.The acting is OK given the premise and the spotty plotting; Johnson has now become comfortable in this territory playing the likeable action hero and does a good job. Neve Campbell is also fairly solid as his wife and it was nice to see that she had some skills of her own (rather than being the clichéd and somewhat pathetic damsel in distress character).The final sequence is an OK and fairly good way to wrap the film up; although the hall of mirrors stuff has clearly been ripped off from Enter The Dragon and it has to be said it isn't executed here with nearly as much tension, skill or panache as the aforementioned film.Still on the whole I did like this film and found it to be tense and quite nerve-wracking (although like I say I'm terrified of heights so the sight of anyone looking down from a great height automatically puts me on edge). Despite its narrative weaknesses, Skyscraper is fast-paced and action-packed enough to work on the whole and as a mindless piece of escapism it is practically perfect.",Skyscraper
63,kirbylee70-599-526179,"""GOT ANY DUCT TAPE?""",9,24 October 2018,"The rise of Dwayne Johnson to become perhaps the biggest action box office star at present has taken time and that time has paid off. Not only does he offer up some of the best action moments on screen these days he also has taken the time to learn how to act as well. Having started out as a professional wrestler, The Rock, in the WWE he didn't follow the path laid out by Hulk Hogan whose movie career took off and sank quickly, in large part because he simply didn't learn how to act. Johnson has learned from that mistake. It shows in his latest film SKYSCRAPER.Johnson plays Will Sawyer, an FBI agent who loses his left leg in the opening segment of the film. Time passes and he is now off the force and married to his surgeon Sarah (Neve Campbell). The couple have two children, twin children Georgia and Henry (McKenna Roberts and Noah Cottrell). With the help of one of his old FBI friend Ben, Will has a new job checking out the security and safety systems for the largest skyscraper ever built.Wealthy Chinese entrepreneur Zhao Long Ji (Chin Han) has invested in this building, a self-sufficient living space he intends to open to families, a city in itself. Called The Pearl the building is three times as tall as the Empire State building and will house not just families but gardens, stores and more as well. The insurance company refuses to insure the building until the final inspection. Will is there to take care of that while his family is the only group living in the building so far.Will is provided with a tablet housing the building's security. An attempt to steal it is foiled but there is a traitor among those working in the building. Kores Botha (Roland Moller), a terrorist and professional criminal has taken over the building and the tablet as well as the security codes are now his. Will is offsite after escaping from kidnappers working for Botha. He knows his family is still there and he heads back to rescue them.Botha has set one of the mid-floors on fire, the flames intensifying and moving upward, no longer impeded by the fire safety systems he had shut down. Not only is Will's family still trapped above the floor where the fire broke out, Zhao Long Ji is still in the building as well on the top floors with the insurance investigator and his security team. Police are locked out of the system, the elevators are shut down and now only Will can save them all IF he can make it into the building.Combine elements of DIE HARD and THE TOWERING INFERNO along with a number of other action flicks, mix well and the end result is a cake that taste like no other. Many will say that this film is exactly like those but it has enough ingredients of its own to make it a singular picture unlike those it borrows loosely from. Most notable of those it the fact we're presented with an amputee hero, something I'm not sure has ever been done before and definitely not to the extent it is here.Johnson handles the role of Will quite admirably with several layers he has to contend with. The most expected is the heroic action star which he's already shown he can handle. But here he also has to be able to make us believe he is that amputee in every scene he's in. Add to that the loving and caring family man. Now toss in the fact that beneath it all is a man who's still trying to find his place in life after his accident, unsure of himself and afraid that he'll make a mistake. It isn't until his family is truly on the line that his instincts kick in and he takes on the role of hero.The rest of the cast does fantastic job as well. With the exception of several episodes of HOUSE OF CARDS Neve Campbell hasn't done a whole lot lately. It's nice to see her at it again and she deserves more roles like this. And both Roberts and Cottrell do a great job as their children. Moller takes on the role of villain with ease and Han as the under siege billionaire does a great job as well.But this movie being the action picture that it is and in the setting it has chosen is also about special effects. There are plenty on hand here to enjoy and they are amazingly done. Let's be honest this is a CGI (Computer Generated Image) movie and they've made it all believable. From the prosthetic leg to the building itself, everything looks real.The end result here is a popcorn movie that will have your palms sweating and your pulse racing. And in the middle of it all you'll develop an admiration for duct tape as well. Don't ask why, just watch and find out. If some duct tape companies don't get a sales boost from this movie it won't be for lack of trying. For a fun fueled ride take a leap of faith just like Will does trying to get into this skyscraper and have some fun.",Skyscraper

I've loved lots of Dwayne's films including ""Snitch"" & ""Rampage"" & ""Jumanji:Welcome to the Jungle"" & ""San Andreas"" just to mention a few, there's something old school retro about ""The Rock"" & the movies he makes as there made in the old 80's & 90's formula where big muscled guys get put in dangerous situations & fight to survive just like ""Schwarzenegger"" & ""Stallone"" back in the day.
I love Dwayne he's so Awesome & he's keeping that old Action Thriller spirit alive in today's ""Super hero"" & ""Fantasy"" obsessed movie world, i feel he's the only guy doing this with the exception of say ""Jason Statham"" who i also really like!!!Here Dwayne plays Will Saywer a security expert who has to rescue his family in a huge burning skyscraper that has been taken over by terrorists, it's a simple plot & that's why it's so good & it's full of intense action & exciting edge of the seat thrilling stunts & dangerous situations, just an old school action Thriller & abit of the old disaster movie feel to it.""SKYSCRAPER"" is good solid exciting action packed fun with another Awesome ""Dwayne Johnson"" leading action hero role.",Skyscraper

Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson stars here alongside Neve Campbell, and they both give great performances. The acting here is solid from all cast members, even the child actors. The writing can get kinda cheesy sometimes, but let's face it, with a film like this, we're not really looking for Oscar winning dialogue. You can go into this film expecting a fairly predictable plot, but you still have a really fun time with it even though it is by the numbers. I loved the visual effects, they handled all that very well. I liked how they gave the wife (Neve Campbell) some more to do than you usually might see, her character is a badass, just like Johnson's.

Skyscraper is an update on this classic film with a decidedly Asian flavour. Its a good mix of East locale Hong Kong meets West in the form of US actor, Dwayne Johnson. Johnson has a real physicality that works beautifully in the context of a disaster movie. Watching his character navigate perilous situations at dizzying heights had my hands sweating (I really don't like heights). Nerve racking and thrilling, Skyscraper film rolls along happily from one dare devil scene to the next. It really is wall to wall action, with some combat scenes to add variety in the form of terrorists, who created the inferno Johnson is forced to confront, to save his family. There's also a little ""Enter the Dragon"" style ploy used near the end of the film, for those paying attention. Lightweight, well paced, implausible but still thoroughly enjoyable.

The pacing in the film takes a toll toward the end, and like the children captured inside the building, you will be begging to be taken out of this building by the time the credits roll.

75,rgkarim,"Trying To Build High, But Only Climbed So Far",7,14 July 2018,"Disaster movies and action kind of go hand in hand, but seldom does it involve more than trying to dodge whatever artificial natural disaster the Hollywood directors deem up. Today's movie review focuses on a film that tries to blur the lines between the two a little better, in what will hopefully be a new twist on the action/disaster movie frontier. Utilizing the popular leading man of Dwayne Johnson to carry the movie, there seems to be hope that this Die-Hard copier can potentially bring enough bucks in to get the attention of the modern era. Does it work? Robbie K here to bring you yet another review this time on:Movie: Skyscraper (2018)Director:
 Rawson Marshall Thurber
Writer:
 Rawson Marshall Thurber
Stars:
 Dwayne Johnson, Neve Campbell, Pablo Schreiber 
LIKES:The Special Effects: The leading point of the movie is the impressive display of CGI in this movie. Perhaps a little corny at times, the movie really invested well in high definition sound to rattle the theater as the chaos of the crime unfolds. Excessive computer-generated images are the key to bringing the inferno to life, but is still beautiful rendered to design a building that will only be fiction for a short while. The world crafting gets kudos for me, and will hopefully impress you as well. The Realism: Despite there being some fiction behind this movie, it is a little more grounded to the real world than one might expect. The ""Pearl"" is a building that will soon exist, a setting that is perfect to craft a surprisingly detailed plot. As the scheme continues to evolve, the realism continues to remain in check, finding kinks in the plot and having to adapt. In addition, even the action keeps things believable, where if a character takes a hit, they actually suffer in terms of performance. All of this adds to suspense of the film and engaged to this adapted plot. Character Involvement: A movie with as many characters always has me worried about how much involvement they have in the plot. Die Hard did it correctly as each character had their place and contributions that actually mattered, and fortunately this copy did the same thing. Most of the characters act as their piece to the puzzle, keeping them integrated into the plot for the entirety of the film and doing a decent job of tying up all loose ends. Even more so, the characters are designed to cover a wide variety of ages, ethnicities, and genre lovers. Good Pace: The movie movies quickly, gets the suspense going, and does little to try to slow things down. For guys like me, the movie rocks in terms of few slow parts and keeps the intensity amped up to a level of ten and that just makes for a fun movie in my opinion. DISLIKES: The Lack of Beginning: The pace may be good in terms of excitement, but I am with many of my friends in that plot development is also key. Skyscraper's beginning is almost nonexistent, all the set up skipped over to get to the action and drop any chance of escaping the predictable plot line off the ledge within 15 minutes. Any chance at suspense build up is practically gone and the story actually takes a hit because of that. If you're not in for the story, then you will glaze over this, but for those looking for a little bit of both worlds don't expect much of an opening. The Plot Gaps: For a building that secure and advanced, you would think there would be more contingency plans than the one they had here. This gap is just one example of the stretches and details you have to ignore to fully enjoy the movie. In addition, there are feats of strength, stamina, and physics defying moves that are also a little cheesy for the fans who love those extremes. As these gaps happen, the movie moves quickly to try and forget about them, but still the movie could have used some refining at points. The Jumps: This was advertised immensely in the trailers and marketing, but the film has that extreme jump that we have grown accustomed to. Yet the movie took that concept and milked it for all its worth. Skyscraper tries to pay homage to Die Hard in many ways, and while it fits into the grand scheme of the movie, the film goes a little overboard with the gimmicks. All the sacrificing brings that bang for your buck, but in terms of story it's only okay for me. The Villains Development: I'll give them props, they have made a better villain than many movies have as of late in the form of Botha (Roland Møller). And while this one of the better villains, it still needed more work in his character development. Comparing to its inspiration source, the villain started giving us some deeper levels, but then it tapered out and he went back to the generic villain. A little more insight and integration could have done wonders to expand the tale even more. Even his side kicks and team held promise, but again they too were overshadowed by the protagonist's tale, screen time, and jumps. The Action: Did it fit with the tale? Yes. Was it realistic? Yes. Was it exciting? Depends. Skyscraper's battles are decently coordinate, but much of this lacks the bite that other movies have had. They are quickly executed, very simplistic, and sometimes a bit overdone in my opinion, but this movie's feeling of trying to survive the manmade disaster I guess takes precedence over the gun fight. Not the worst action, but definitely room for improvement. The VERDICT:  Skyscraper is an example of impressive movie theater worthy special effects, and surprisingly stays on the realistic qualities these franchises often ignore. I give it applause for integration of characters, and Johnson doing a fabulous job leading the film. Still the movie is a diluted piece compared to the movie it copies so much of and therefore needed some amping up in terms of story, villain development and action. Perhaps a little less jumping and a little more time could have given this tale the needed oomph to rock it into higher scores. Still the effects do render it a good theater film, but if you don't want this kind of movie... save it until you get home. My scores are: Action/Crime/Drama: 7.0
Movie Overall: 5.0",Skyscraper
76,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Skyscraper,6,16 July 2018,"Actors cheating death by doing stunts that would make the late Hal Needham jealous. CGI flames that come on like gangbusters but look kinda fake. Dwayne Johnson failing to equal his best performance (that would be 2013's Snitch) by coming off as the poor man's Bruce Willis. Johnson's daffy, acting style consisting of him readily talking to himself (ugh). Three foggily-defined villains that barely connect to each other. It's all here in 2018's Skyscraper, my latest write-up. Taking place in Hong Kong, promoting the manly use of duct tape, and partially filmed in Vancouver (I can see the slight resemblance), Skyscraper tells the story of a one-legged security expert (Johnson as Will Sawyer) being framed for starting a blaze in the tallest building in the world (nicknamed ""The Pearl""). As Skyscraper barrels at a lightening pace, you can see ""Pearl's"" copied architectural style and copied aerial shots from a certain 1974 vehicle (I'll get to that later). Skyscraper, which feels like it should've been rated R (this thing is a tad violent), is techy, loud, futuristic, and preposterous yet adds a certain amount of appeal. Mainly, it's a condensed, souped-up combination of The Towering Inferno and Die Hard. That's minus ""Inferno"" and Die Hard's feasible buildup, extensive character development, and non-middling plot. Questions I asked myself during a screening of 2018's Skyscraper: Why didn't the fire department show up when this flick marched into its second act? And why do two main characters not stick to the ceiling when an elevator is barreling downward at Mach 1? And oh yeah, where the heck has actress Neve Campbell been for the last decade? Anyway, Skyscraper is the definition of a high-octane, action endeavor. It's relentless and farcical, with plenty of jaw-dropping, ""yeah right"" moments. The good guys survive by the skin of their teeth and the bad guys perish in similar situations. Bottom line: If you're afraid of heights or surrender to vertigo, avoid seeing this 109-minute film at all costs. In conclusion, Skyscraper's director is Rawson Marshall Thurber. Normally he does comedies. Here, he distracts the thinking man's audience by blowing stuff up, piling on the tech-savvy gadgets, letting veritable bones crack, and paying homage to one Bruce Lee (check out the rooftop, mirror fight scene in Skyscraper's last ten minutes). Thurber pulls out all the stops so get your earplugs ready. Rating: 2 and a half stars.",Skyscraper
77,rannynm,", towering pace and consistent acting led by Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson",10,13 July 2018,"Skyscraper is an entertaining, yet derivative homage to 80s action films. A towering pace and consistent acting provide for a memorable summer detour. This is sure to be a worthwhile watch for any action movie fans.The movie follows former hostage negotiator Will (Dwayne Johnson), who now accesses building security after a tragic misfire left him as an amputee. While analyzing the world's tallest and safest building, terrorists led by Kores (Roland Møller) mysteriously access building schematics to take control. However, things reach an all time low for Will once Kores takes Will's family hostage and frames him for the infiltration. With everything left to lose, Will must push past his setbacks in order to sort out this mess and save his family.Dwayne Johnson, as Will, is my favorite character due to his ever-present charisma and even relate-ability with his physical struggles. His love and determination for his family also make the movie all the more intense. Neve Campbell, as Sarah, is just as believable with her determination to the family and has more nuances than just resorting to a damsel in distress. Chin Han, as Zhao, brings a mysterious layer to his involvement with the skyscraper as his business is not what it seems. Roland Møller, as Kores, gives Dwayne Johnson a run for his money in terms of strength and is a formidable yet clichéd threat for him. However, his vibrant expressions are enough to lighten his clichéd dialogue. Noah Cottrell and McKenna Roberts, as Henry and Georgia, complete the pack as the cute twins of Will and Sarah, whose combined braveness helps forward the family dynamic. However, Henry's asthma seems a little too situational at times.Rawson Marshall Thurber's direction brings out a brisk pace with fresh new takes at fisticuffs and shootouts alike many 80s action movies. However, a few of the scenes lack in originality, feeling like a borderline copy of other action films. My favorite scene is the opening hostage negotiation, as it sets a thrilling and unexpected array of events, even if it is not set in the main skyscraper centerpiece. The other flaw is that it could have used more nuances in the scenarios as opposed to having such a predictable plot with unsurprising twists. At times, it feels more like a parody than a movie, with unintentionally funny scenes. However, the fact that it never takes itself too seriously adds to its quality and creates pure escapism.The movie's message is to never judge a man by his impediments, as pure willpower can defy many obstacles. I give this film 3.5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18 because of its intense action and language.

78,rannynm,"An Entertaining, Yet Derivative Homage to 80s Action Era",10,23 July 2018,"This science fiction film grabbed my attention from the beginning, because of its very interesting plot and fascinating storyline. It made me feel driven to discover what would happen at the end. From the beginning of the film, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, because it has a combination of topics that I love seeing in movies - action and suspense! These drew me in. I wanted to finally find out what the outcome of the movie would be. I also liked it because I admire Dwayne Johnson's exceptional work as an actor. He is very expressive with his actions and makes the audience empathize with what he is going through. Because of that, I always follow the movies he works in. Skyscraper is about a past FBI leader and war veteran called Will Ford who is now managing security programs for skyscrapers. He's been sent on a once-in-a-lifetime work opportunity to establish security measures for the tallest and safest building in the world, located in China. Suddenly, the skyscraper turns into flames and the security measures fail. He is the primary suspect since he is the only one authorized to control the security. As the story progresses, Will must find those responsible for the destruction in order to clear his name and somehow rescue his family who are trapped inside the building, above the fire line.My favorite scene in this film is when Will runs away from the authorities, climbs up the construction equipment, moves it so that it will point at a floor close to the fire line, and jumps towards a broken window. I love this scene because it shows what a man is capable of doing for his family's welfare. He risks his life in order to save them from the fire that is threatening their lives. Aside from that, I was astonished at all the special effects used to create this action sequence. The post production of this scene is flawless. It all seems as if it really happens. You don't notice the editing at all. The main message of this film is that family comes before anything else. Some people are driven to do the impossible because of the love they feel towards their family. In this film, Will's devotion to his wife and kids is very impressive and is admirable. It sends a very family oriented message and teaches a valuable lesson that can be applied to anyone's life. I rate this movie 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 and up.Reviewed by Alejandra G., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews by youth, visit kidsfirst dot org.",Skyscraper
79,Kingslaay,Not too bad,7,22 July 2018,"Skycraper was entertaining and decent enough for an experience at the movies. As a film that will be remembered this is unlikely, it is forgettable. There were some good parts, action scenes, suspense and good acting. One of the big selling points is the Rock himself. The supporting cast is somewhat weak as is the antagonist. What is even more disappointing is the motive for the heist, nothing creative and quite dull. I think they brainstormed doing an action film in a big skyscraper first and then stumbled and conjured up a plot to go with it. Overall not bad, forgettable but entertaining for a night out at the movies. 7/10",Skyscraper

82,moviexclusive,"It's a big, loud and dumb action movie all right, but with Dwayne Johnson's unique brand of star charisma and some logic-defying but undeniably exhilarating stunts",6,12 July 2018,"Dwayne Johnson is easily the most hardworking actor in Hollywood right now, but let's face it, he's pulled his weight - literally and figuratively, mind you - to make what would just otherwise be dumb B-movies a whole lot more enjoyable. In 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle', his chemistry with Kevin Hart and Jack Black lent the CGI-ed adventure humour and heart; in 'Rampage', his buddy pairing with the nine-foot tall albino gorilla named George saved the day and the movie from its own CGI-ed tedium; and in 'Skyscraper', his third movie in just seven months, Johnson makes the plainly ludicrous almost believable. Oh yes, there is hardly a semblance of logic or credibility to the stunts in this unabashed cross between 'Die Hard' and 'The Towering Inferno', but hey as a mindless action movie, you can hardly argue that it does deliver some heart-stopping vertiginous thrills.As written and directed by his 'Central Intelligence' helmer Rawson Marshall Thurber, 'Skyscraper' places Johnson's former FBI hostage team rescue leader-turned-security consultant Will Sawyer in a race-against-time to rescue his wife and two kids from a raging inferno within the world's tallest building. Thurber can hardly be bothered about why the building is on fire, hence the throwaway premise of some Euro-accented thugs wanting to retrieve a thumb drive from the building's billionaire owner Zhao Long Ji (Chin Han); instead, he's a lot more enamoured with the titular structure which Will will have to scale. A fictional 3,500-foot 200-storey edifice, the high-rise named The Pearl boasts a king-size indoor garden complete with a waterfall as well as a giant sphere atop its frame.Any self-deserving action movie junkie will know right from the start that these two distinct features will be the basis of the film's major set-pieces - the garden boasts one of its most nail-biting moments where Will fashions a makeshift bridge out of a piece of wood for his wife and son to cross above an entire field of vegetation engulfed in flames; and the sphere is the scene for a virtual reality hall-of-mirrors climax that to Thurber's credit is actually quite imaginatively designed and executed. Nevertheless, the piece de resistance is arguably Will's attempt to jump from the arm of wobbly tower crane into an open broken window of the building's burning 96th floor. Never mind the physics of that, or the sheer logic-defying precursor of Will scaling a 100 storeys or so on the construction crane within 10 minutes - watching Johnson pull it off is still as stomach-churning, edge-of-your-seat exhilarating and viscerally satisfying as it gets.Even more incredible is how Will manages to do all that with part of his left leg missing, the consequence of a harrowing operation gone wrong which is also conveniently used to explain how he met his spouse Sarah (Neve Campbell). As manipulative as that bit of prosthetic may be in garnering more sympathy for Will's circumstances, there is also no doubt that Thurber puts the detail to good use - one sequence has him fighting on a one leg in a mano-a-mano that recalls Johnson's old wrestling days; another has him detaching the metal in order to hoist himself up from the side of the building; and yet another sees him use it to jam a pair of titanium doors before they close. It's by far the most nifty uses of a prosthesis that we've seen; that, and duct tape actually, which according to the movie's logic, is sticky enough to help you scale the building's exterior and handy enough to use as bandage.Like we said at the start, as incredulous as it all is, Johnson ultimately sells what would have been laughable in the hands of any other star. Of course, Johnson would probably have been better-served with the kind of witty self-deprecating repartee he usually evinces - ""if you can't fix it with duct tape, then you ain't using enough duct tape' is as far as Thurber ever gets - but still Johnson's sheer charisma makes you root for him even through the most absurd moments. Campbell makes a surprisingly solid supporting act, who more than holds her own against the baddies, among them Hannah Quinlivan's (aka Mrs Jay Chou) dominatrix-styled assassin. Ditto for our very own Chin Han, who brings out some unexpected layers to his underwritten character next to Johnson especially in the final act.There is yet another accomplishment which should be duly acknowledged - though set in Hong Kong, 'Skyscraper' was primarily lensed in Vancouver, which makes the generous exterior shots of The Pearl against the Hong Kong skyline even more impressive. But at the end of the day, this stunt- and CGI-laden vehicle was constructed on Johnson's very back as an intense thrill-ride with audacious stunts, and on those counts, it succeeds exceedingly well. It's just the kind of popcorn diversion you'd be looking for in a summer blockbuster - and just as forgettable soon after it's over - so as long as you're not looking for smarts or for that matter realism, you'll probably thoroughly enjoy this slice of Rock-solid action movie escapism.",Skyscraper

88,Prashast_Singh,A great action entertainer... a must watch for action fans!,10,16 September 2018,"All the negative feedback for this film is attributed to its situation-based plot which doesn't go complex in terms of development. Well then, you must keep in mind that this is just a fun action movie and a great one at that. SKYSCRAPER rose above my expectations right from the beginning and from the point when the action became frequent, nonstop and back to back.More than anything else, this film is to be watched for the action. It will definitely remind you of DIE HARD due to the same genre and themes. But that is what makes it even more entertaining. SKYSCRAPER can be called a modern-day DIE HARD with excellent CGI as well. The high rise concept is astonishing.There are action sequences which stand out as the major highlight. From fistfights to shootouts to explosions: each and every action block has been done remarkably and efficiently. Those complaining about lack of character development are the same who call action films as mindless only because of lacking this thing. SKYSCRAPER being a pure actioner isn't a drama to show character development. And who said there isn't character development? It IS there in the form of action sequences and life-threatening situations but people won't count it only because it isn't dramatic. This film isn't for such viewers. Only if there is frequent action doesn't mean nothing is happening.If you can praise a drama just for its emotions and depth, a thriller just for its twists and suspense, then why can't you praise an action film just for its action, especially a film of this kind?If you are an action fan, this Dwayne Johnson actioner will have on the edge of your seat. While not as cool as John McClane in DIE HARD, his character is still of the definitive type you can associate with a life-or-death action movie.

95,one9eighty,Won't last the test of time like other towering infernos that have been committed to film,5,12 February 2020,"Mixing a little bit of the Towering Inferno with Die Hard and the Raid comes the latest film from the Rock - Duane Johnson. After suffering disabilitating injuries as the leader of a military squad it's been some years since he picked up a gun. The road to recovery has seen him find a wife and have children, and now he's at the final stages of a job interview to look after the newest, top of the range skyscraper that money and technology can build. Unfortunately the day he is due to start is the day the bad guys want to take down his gadzillionaire boss. The set fire to a lower floor and hack the computers so they have control and can send the fire up the building using the sophisticated air vents installed in the building. All this happens while The Rock is out of the building, he's been lured away by an old friend who wants The Rocks tablet, which is the computerised key to the buildings controls, secondary only to his boss's access. Things take a turn for the worse when The Rock realises his family are trapped in the building, and worse yet he's wanted by the police as they suspect he's part of the plot that gave the bad guys access. It's up the Rock to save his family, save his boss, stop the bad guys, and save the day - but if anyone is going to do it, of course it'll be the Rock.Barring the first 20 minutes or so this film is fairly high octane throughout. Although it's an action film it is more an action hero, action film. By that I mean The Rock is the main drive to events, and a large amount of what he does is really really farfetched for cinematic effect. The Rock performs ok, although I am sure the disability rights campaigners would argue that there would be better people for the role that actually have a disability, rather than somebody having had CGI applied to have a disability. I didn't get much chemistry between The Rock and his wife; it felt like a relationship had been added just to give the Rock motivation to enter a burning building, because trying to rescue his boss and save the day just wasn't enough. Thankfully the film wasn't that long; under two hours, as such it was easy enough to palette. I wouldn't call this a classic, and I can't see it getting many plaudits, but it was a no brainer, fairly family friendly, action film; which allows you to leave your brain at the door.I can only give this a 5 at most because in years to come it'll most probably be forgotten and irrelevant.",Skyscraper

99,jon.h.ochiai,"""Skyscraper"" is like ""Die Hard"", but sans Hans",8,16 July 2018,"Writer and Director Rawson Marshall Thurber's action thriller ""Skyscraper"" is ""Die Hard"" lite, but without iconic villain Hans Gruber. Chiseled resilience squared Dwayne Johnson is heroic amputee Will Sawyer, who desperately tries to save his beloved wife Sarah, daughter Georgia, and son Henry, played by Neve Campbell, McKenna Roberts, and Noah Cottrel, from flaming skyscraper The Pearl. Billionaire Zhao, played by covert cool Chin Han, built the The Pearl in Hong Kong, the world's tallest building at 220 stories, three times taller than the Empire State Building. This also resembles ""The Towering Inferno"" from the 1970's. Dwayne is the only reason to watch this often derivative feature. I saw in an interview that The Rock, Dwayne Johnson researched and worked with War Veteran amputees to translate the sense of authenticity in Will. He does for the most part. Will is the War Hero and former FBI operative forced to the sidelines, because of tragedy 10 years ago. He now wears a metal prosthetic leg below his left knee. He married the surgeon, who saved him, Sarah. They have two great kids. Will has become a private security expert. His former FBI Teammate and friend Ben, charming clandestine Pablo Schreiber, arranged the meeting with Zhao at The Pearl as its next Security Executive. Will and his family are guests in The Pearl. The Pearl is state-of-the art technology and luxury with its remotely located safety system. What could go wrong? A lot. Otherwise, there's no movie. Crazed terrorist Botha, played by angry calculated Roland Moller, and his men explode the 96th of the building creating the raging inferno. Meanwhile, deadly Xia, played by cool kick-ass Hannah Quinlivan, uses martial arts skills and automatic weapons to disable the fire safety protocols. The terrorism occurs more than nihilistic anarchy. Regardless, Will must save his family from their imminent demise. Much of Rawson's narrative is telegraphed. Yet, I was completely invested in Dwayne's Will. Before everything goes to hell, Will touchingly admits, ""I kind of laid down my sword..."" Rawson and Dwayne worked previously on the underrated hit ""Central Intelligence"", the action buddy picture with Kevin Hart. Without Kevin, ""Skyscraper"" is way more dour, and a lot less fun. What Rawson wisely leverages is Dwayne's earnestness and heart. The action is often hyperbole, particularly with Will's leaping from the construction crane to the flaming tower. It's particularly satisfying watching the Rock lay the ""smack down"" on the big bad guys. And as physically imposing as Will is, Dwayne enrolls with that sense of fear and anger in his eyes. On the other upside, the women in ""Skyscraper"" are total badass. It's great seeing Neve Campbell back in the movies. Her Sarah is strong, smart and protects her children to the death. She convincingly kicks the crap out of traitorous Mr. Pierce, played by snakelike Noah Taylor, who threatens her flesh and blood. Hannah as the mysterious sleek assassin Xia speaks quietly before dispatching a lethal sidekick. You just don't mess with her. What ""Skyscraper"" misses is the maverick villain. Botha is not that at all. Where I think Dwayne has more physical presence than Bruce Willis in ""Die Hard"". ""Skyscraper"" fails not having the iconic charismatic villain like Hans Gruber, played by the late great Alan Rickman. Alan mesmerized as Han, conveying human complexity. Roland and Rawson's Botha is so one-dimensional evil. Moreover, Botha doesn't pose the credible threat to Will, metal leg and all. ""Skyscraper"" is pretty good. Entertaining. Dwayne Johnson is greater than the material and this movie. He's enough to enjoy watching the movie. His Will fights for family and love as his noble cause. Too bad the villain or the ultimate intention aren't nearly so compelling. I think the Rock deserved better. In a sense so do we.",Skyscraper

101,juliankennedy23,Baby's first Die Hard,5,5 March 2019,"Skyscraper: 5 out of 10: The Rock hits a hard place (American box-office wise) with this Asian market disaster action movie.You know Dwayne Johnson has appeared in what one could assume would be great cinematic bombs (A Jumanji sequel and movie based on the video game Rampage?) that turned out to be much better than they had any right to be. Even San Andreas brought more to the table than it would appear on the surface. He isn't perfect (cough Baywatch Cough) but overall The Rock seems to have a good eye for a solid property.Teaming up again with Central Intelligence director Rawson Marshall Thurber (who also wrote), a Towering Inferno/ Die Hard movie set in Hong Kong to guarantee Chinese financing and box office seems like a no brainer. I don't know what The Rock saw in the original script and or pitch but nothing on the screen seemed worth his time. This is a very paint by numbers affair clearly aimed at the low hanging fruit of the international market.The Good: There are some nice ideas in this film. Giving The Rock only one leg to even the odds and create some more dramatic tension in mook fights is a brilliant idea. Both The Rock and Neve Cambell as his wife are very good in this. The Rock is by no means phoning this one in and Neve Campbell makes a believable action mom. Hannah Quinlivan as the second in charge bad gal is an actual breakout star. One wishes she had been the head bad guy (see below).The Bad: Man this is like pet peeves week.The head bad guy (Roland Møller) is a charismatic black hole. One of the keys in remaking a Die hard film is having a memorable bad guy. You know Tommy Lee Jones in Under Seige, Dennis Hopper in Speed, the snakes in Snakes on a Plane; Roland is playing a dumb white antagonist with even dumber motivation and an even dumber plan. (Set building on fire with you on the roof, ?????, profit). This is where you put your scenery chewing veteran star playing against type, not a man who one assumes is a mook cause he has zero personality and is dressed like everyone else.2. The building is empty. Why would you make a Towering Inferno movie and not have people in the tower? Here is your chance to fill it with dozens of Hollywood and Hong Kong cinema B-listers with the occasional free trip to Hong Kong to be in a Rock movie A-lister cameo. Plus all those cameos gives us a chance to see the building pre-fire. Setting the table so to speak. We can see who is secretly a conman, who is deaf and won't hear the alarm, who is banging his secretary in the side. This is often the best part of any disaster film. The fire is almost at the 82nd floor means a lot more when there is a diabetic lady with a cat played by Goldie Hawn living there.3. There is a crowd cheering The Rock on in front of a jumbotron like it was an Adam Sandler sports comedy. I cannot begin to emphasize how much I hate this technique. And to make matters even worse the film doesn't really earn this. Oh, and there is the cop from Die Hard that believes in The Rock and the cop from Die Hard that is convinced that he is in on it and neither of them should really even be in the movie.4. I actually have a puzzling query. Did they originally cast an African American actress to play The Rock's wife before casting Neve Campbell? I am asking because while McKenna Roberts and Noah Cottrell are actually quite good as the kids they look nothing like the offspring of Dwayne Johnson and Neve Campbell.5. I am sure that redoing Enter The Dragon's climax looked good on paper.The Ugly: There is a good scene where the insurance adjuster betrays the building owner and reveals himself to be part of the scheme. (He goes on to be beaten up by Neve Campbell.) It is a shocking moment... a true surprise.... Mainly because it negates any reason for The Rock to be there at all. I mean The Rock's job was to test the safety and security features. The big deal was that to test them all the protocols would be turned off so The Rock's tablet would, in essence, control the building. The guy who hired the Rock was in on the scheme but one assumes he needed The Rock to convince the insurance adjuster. But if he also was in on the scheme they could have had any mook do the Rock's job and get the magic tablet. After all, all the Rock does is give a simple powerpoint demonstration and the two people looking into his credentials are both bad guys. In other words, there was no logical reason to hire someone outside your crew to take control of the building's security. In particular someone like The Rock.In Conclusion: You know there are plenty of great foreign disaster movies. There are also some top-notch foreign Die Hard ripoffs. This movie reminds me of a foreign film from the eighties with the crowds cheering our heroes and the simple yet stupid plot. It is watchable but it is nothing you haven't seen better so many times before.",Skyscraper
102,bankofmarquis,The Rock saves this one from mediocrity,6,19 July 2018,"I have come to respect Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson as a charismatic actor that gives his all in whatever motion picture he is in. He can make bad films seem fun (like the recent RAMPAGE) or elevate good action films to great action films (I'm looking at you FAST & FURIOUS franchise). So, I was was open to checking out the ""Die Hard meets Towering Inferno"" summer popcorn flick SKYSCRAPER for I was expecting a ""B"" movie with some outrageous stunts, common-sense defying decision making and a plot by a bad guy that is way too complex all wrapped around Johnson's charisma.And...that's pretty much what I got.Skyscraper tells the story of a...ahem...Skyscraper. The ""tallest building ever"" (are there any other kind in these kinds of films?). The Rock plays a Security consultant who has been brought in to assess the safety and security systems of this building and when he says ""I've been all over these systems and know them like the back of my hand"", you know that knowledge will come in handy - and it does when the bad guys come to get the McGuffin,What is a McGuffin you ask? That is Alfred Hitchock's term for the thing that is propelling the plot forward. It doesn't really matter what the McGuffin is, it just needs to be something that one person has and other people are willing to lie cheat, scheme and kill for. In this case it is a flashdrive with sensitive information on it, but it could easily have been ""the codes"" to some secret device, ""tech"" that makes the world better (or can generate large sums of money, a treasure of cash or jewels or the latest innovation in dolphin training...you get the idea.So...the bad guys are after the McGuffin, the Rock is after the bad guys because accidentally trapped in the burning high rise (did I mention that the bad guys started the high rise on fire?) is the Rock's family. This gives our hero ""stakes"" in this game, so he'll do ANYTHING to save his family.All pretty predictable, but with the Rock's charm and charisma, it doesn't seem quite so silly. Neve Campbell is back on-screen (where has she been?) as his wife, who (of course) is a kick-ass former Navy Doctor (you know those skills are gonna come in handy). The rest of the cast is pretty forgettable, except, perhaps, Hannah Quinlavan as the main bad guy's henchmen who is indestructible (until, of course, she isn't).The big disappointment for me in this film is the unfulfilled promise of a few of the premises set up by Writer and Director Rawson Marshall Thurber (CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE). For example, The Rock's character suffers a trauma in the pre-opening credits scene, losing the lower half of a leg (I'm not spoiling anything here, it is in the previews). Exploring his PTSD or the limitations of his handicap would have been interesting, but aside for a couple of grunts...nothing. Another interesting premise is the inside of the building has ""it's own eco-system"" and you see a lavish forest somewhere in between floors 150-175 (did I mention that this is a really tall building) but they don't really use this set and set it on fire quickly. Finally, they do set up a ""house of mirrors"" early on that is paid off rather nicely in the end, the highlight in the film for me.All-in-all a rather mediocre afternoon at the movies. The promise and execution of the premise were not ""so bad it's good"" nor were they ""good"" they were just...""fair""...fortunately, you had the Rock to save the day - and the film - yet again.Letter Grade: B- (I'm probably being generous, but I really liked The Rock in this)6 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)",Skyscraper

From the very informative book ""The 15 Geniuses Behind The Lens: How The Greatest Film Directors Shaped The Movies We See Today,"" Welles set up a classic ending that Thurber, who wrote and directed ""Skyscraper,"" copied and adopted cleverly into his plot. I love to see the great films of the past reshaped by using memorable highlights from the masters of the cinema. ""Skyscraper"" is a well-made, well-thought, script wise, film that will entertain even the most jaded viewer. Dwayne Johnson always delivers in his protagonist roles, and as co-producer, he doesn't disappoint. Critics claim Thurber's effort is too much like ""The Towering Inferno"" and ""Die Hard,"" but I felt ""Skyscraper"" departed from those fire-in-the-tall-builing motion pictures enough to provide some chilling and thrilling scenes. Photography, special effects, even the acting was above par. I would highly recommend this work for anyone looking for a night's full of breathless excitement.",Skyscraper
109,kjproulx,"Derivative, But Fun",6,13 July 2018,"When you see that Dwayne Johnson is headlining a movie, your first thought shouldn't be to think that it has awards potential. Sure, he may decide to switch up his career as he gets older, but he loves choosing films that play it safe and entertain his audience in a pleasing way. He knows his audience and he plays the same character well every time. Watching the trailers for Skyscraper, I knew exactly what to expect from this movie, and although there's definitely more heart to the movie than I was expecting, if you've seen the trailers and predict the way this film plays out in your head, you've pretty much already seen it. Skyscraper is a disposable action flick, but it's absolutely worth a watch and here's why.The premise is very simple; an ex-military operative has lost his leg in an explosion and now owns a security company and wishes to be in touch with the people who are about to finish constructing the tallest building in the world. With a unique design, many things can and will go wrong. Thrust into action once evil men take over the building, he must find a way through the building and back to his family, who are held hostage. The plot plays out from there exactly how you think it would, but it's the particular moments that will thrill audiences and the devotion that Will Sawyer (Dwayne Johnson) has to his family.It seems like I'm beating a dead horse in stating that this film is elevated by the charisma of Johnson, but it truly is. Not only is he as likable as ever, but he takes on a more dramatic role here, leaving out a lot of the comedy. He and Neve Campbell (who plays his wife Sarah) have surprisingly solid chemistry here and that aspect of this particular film is what had me wanting to root for him to succeed. That being said, if you're hoping this film isn't quite like the promotional material and that it takes itself a little more seriously than having its leading man jumping from a crane onto the tallest building in the world, then this definitely won't impress you all that much.The one drawback to this movie, in my opinion, was the over-the-top set pieces. This movie decides to take itself very seriously at times and the performances work very well in that respect, but when you have a man dangling outside of a building, with nothing but a rope and wrapped prosthetic leg keeping him alive, the notion of ""suspension of disbelief"" only goes so far to save it. Many viewers may find the set pieces to be incredibly entertaining (I surely did), but I found they didn't particularly mesh with the movie that was being told. This film tries to reach the levels that the original Die Hard did, and for that reason alone, the ridiculous action slightly took away from the experience.In the end, Skyscraper delivers on pretty much everything it promises and even adds a layer of emotion when looking at the family dynamic. Director Rawson Marshall Thurber knows how to make a fun action movie and that's exactly the word I would use to describe a movie like this. It almost seems cliche to call a movie like Skyscraper ""fun,"" but that's the best word to describe this movie without sounding negative. It's about as derivative and generic as action movies come, but it pulls everything off pretty well, making for a solid watch. It's not going to win any standing ovations, but it will surely serve as a fun blockbuster to see this summer. If you're looking for an easy watch at the movies, I'd recommending checking out Skyscraper.",Skyscraper
110,kuarinofu,A 125 mil B-movie that's not even entertaining,5,15 October 2018,"Don't get me wrong, we've had these before: 2012, The Day After Tomorrow and alike, as well as some with Mr. Johnson - Rampage and San Andreas. Some of these are guilty pleasures, I love re-watching those huge budgeted disaster b-movies just for the atmosphere.
This one is the most confusing since it's very well made in terms of technical side. The CGI is done and composed in a acrophobia and pyrophobia inducing way. It actually feels. Sucks that there's nothing interesting or fun to back this up.
Mr. Johnson is a very charismatic guy, but he can't carry this anyway. The plot is so cliche you're left with no surprises throughout the movie. You literally will know everything within the first 10 mins. 
I think the main problem of this is that it rests on sort of a middle ground. They should've either made it so bad it's good going further over the top, or made it more grounded making it easier to root for the main character and actually get invested (but I guess we already have Die Hard for that).
Instead it's a very stupid script wrapped into good visuals for a movie even Mr. Johnson is unable to save.",Skyscraper

There is fun here but it isn't a great film and support characters tend to be left with nothing to do.",Skyscraper

113,lojitsu,If duct tape doesn't fix it...,7,14 August 2018,"""Skyscraper""
Or: ""The Rock does Die Hard""
Genre: Action/HeistLike it or not, Dwayne Johnson is the biggest action star (and I'm not just talking about is 275lb frame) out there right now. When you go to watch one of his movies, you can expect over the top action and not a whole lot of feelings. I'm still kind of surprised that in ""San Andreas"" he didn't just close the fault back up with his biceps or stop the earthquake with his pecs. This being the era of The Rock, we see Johnson in at least 2 or 3 movies a year...Skyscraper being the 3rd I've seen in 2018. While I wait with teeth grinding anticipation for the ""Big Trouble in Little China"" reboot, let's get the Lowedown on Skyscraper with an aspect breakdown.Cast=7
Dwayne Johnson is worth three points for his biceps alone...I know I went to the theater just cause I knew he's in it. Neve Campbell returns to the silver screen as the wife and earns two points...then Chin Han and Byron Mann earn one point each. This was enough to earn seven points out of the gate.
Acting=7
The acting was actually pretty good across the board...I would probably award five points if Neve Campbell wasn't in this movie. Campbell still has the chops and really stole the show from an acting standpoint. I will have to add a couple points just for her...so that would make seven points here too.
Plot=8
A security expert must infiltrate a burning skyscraper, 225 stories above ground, when his family are trapped inside by criminals. Ok...it's really ""Die Hard"" only with a bigger building and a bigger hero. Did that make it better? Not by a long shot...but it was a simple concept that allows for little need for character development. Eight points for plot...yay!
Ending=8
The biggest thing I want in an ending is closure. But from an action movie, I want the most epic action at the end than the rest of the film. I definitely got the action and the closure...the foreshadowing made the ending predictable, so I can't give full points. Let's say eight points for the ending...
Story=5
I was not a fan of the story...they left a lot of hole just to try to explain what Johnson did and why the bad guys were in the building. There was a bit too much character development for Johnson, but not enough for Campbell and her role was just as important. Throwing a five at the building for the story.
Favorite Quote: ""If you can't fix it with duct tape... you ain't using enough duct tape.""Genre: Action
Violent=9
It's an action movie and that means I WANT VIOLENCE!!! I can't award full points for this, as it's PG-13. It's like putting a noise suppressor on a Harley...it kind of defeats the purpose. But I guess the purpose was to make as much money as possible in the Theater. As such, nine points will go to this movie for the epic sky crane jump.
Pace=7
An Action movie, unlike Drama, needs to have a great pace. The acting and the story can't keep you, so it has to be the explosions and car chases. The pace was good...a little lag in the beginning with the character development, but once the fit hits the shan (see how I switched that?) the pace is really good. Seven points for Slitherin.
F/X=10
For an Action movie...I want great CGI sure, but I want some real stunt work. I realize you have to do some things with a computer and a green screen...I also want some work with a stunt crew and the actors doing some of their own stuff. This was the one great thing about the film! The fire F/X was great and the stunts in and out of the building were nice. Ten points will be added to the score...Sub-Genre: Heist
Heist=5
Sorry if this is a spoiler, but of course you have to know the bad guys are after something right? If they are trying to take something as the main plot, then this is a heist movie. I just wasn't feeling what they were trying to do. I can't say it was good or bad, so I'll go with meh here...Five points.
Chemistry=6
In a heist movie, I want chemistry with the robbers. A definite leader and a team of specialists to perform a certain task is what I want to see. While there is a leader, the rest of the team is not fully realized. Despite them being armed. At no point did I feel like they could beat The Rock...six points.
My Score: 7.2
""Skyscraper"" does not hold it's weight as a heist movie, but it's pretty solid as a straight up action flick. It manages to one-up Die Hard in height alone...it's taller but it will never be bigger. It's the same thing I told my kids when they became taller than me in junior high school. If you didn't get to see this in the theater...just hang in there for the video release.",Skyscraper
114,SoumikBanerjee25,"Nothing New, Same Old Formula!",5,21 August 2020,"Dwayne Johnson starrer ""Skyscraper"" is a generic action entertainer that provides a proper visual treat but due to the failure in strengthening its shaky foundation, it unwillingly turned into a mediocrity.
Even While serving the ever working formula for Hollywood blockbusters, Skyscraper promised us something different right from the get go. Going by the first few minutes; I was excited. But after a certain period of time; it loosen up and the storyline just falls flat rather quickly! Like always once again it succumbs to a cliched, mindless mess.
Poor dialogues, Non existence of a Strong negative character also rubbed it in a wrong way!However, Dwayne Johnson's usual charming on screen presence helps us to get through the obstruction. Although he might not have given his best in here but he was the sole reason for me to continue till the end. Other characters lacked big time, especially in relevance factor. Their lack of depth resulting a mere attempt at establishing emotional connection. Which simply didn't work!Despite being a lacklustre in execution for the storyline, it shows its merits in the Technicalities department. Like the cinematography, which had a flair of its own! Great lighting work, minimalist color palette & clever play with the shadows makes it even more pleasurable to experience.
Sound design was adequate; fitting nicely alongside such high octane Visual Imagery.To conclude, it definitely does some things good but make a bunch of glaring errors & misjudgements as well! In the end I am slightly disappointed though I didn't even have any prior expectations!",Skyscraper
115,mfellipecampos,Nice,6,26 February 2021,"The introduction of the film is simple, after a tragedy, the protagonist takes a job in a new wonder of the world, which is almost perfect, and he did well in almost the same. Bandits manage to get in easily and make everything catastrophic, and with 15 minutes of film, nothing needs to be well explained, only action is needed. And after that begins the great adventure of the film, rescuing the protagonist's family, unraveling mysteries that almost have no reason to exist, and the rest is really action. The film makes great use of the stunning scenes, the protagonist does almost impossible things, in the middle of the flames, destruction, and a lot of height, this feature is used a lot to give an extra drama, everything seems to be hundreds of meters high to appear that the protagonist will die every second. Another well-used resource is the special effects, which from the beginning to the end add an extra beauty to the film, putting the megalomania of the supporting actors in a very explicit way. The weak point of the film is the story, almost meaningless and very flawed, does not create a very interesting justification, everything seems to be very easily avoidable or happens easily for the continuity of the film, not even the scenes that flee from the protagonist lead to good situations, the film makes it clear that what counts are the moments of continuous and unrestrained action linked to a rescue scenario. Overall, a good film for those looking for unbridled action without worrying about much, the protagonist is well represented, has crazy ideas and executes them with a certain exaggeration, making everything a little too extreme, in addition to the good execution in the special effects when necessary, and don't worry about remembering the Duro de Matar, it really seems quite.Film seen on the 25th to the 26th of February 2021.",Skyscraper
116,CANpatbuck3664,Cheesy Fun if Expectations are Kept Low,6,2 August 2018,"Skyscraper's premise is pretty easy to put together, the poster for the movie almost encompasses it entirely. With a high rise building on fire, Will Sawyer (Dwayne Johnson) must save his wife Sarah (Neve Campbell) and his kids from a team of terrorists led by Kores Botha (Roland Moller). This isn't new, you've got the classics like Die Hard and this movie uses them as a foundation to build upon. Does it differentiate from those movies? I think it does but not always in a good way. There are times where the screenwriter (Rawson Marshall Thurber pulling both writing and directing duties) seems to be tipping his cap to the audience (the jokes around duct tape work the best) but as the movie slips farther and farther into cliche and implausibility, the more difficult I have extending that praise. How in on the joke was the creative team? I honestly don't know, I want to believe they were but some of the decisions the characters make contradict that line of thinking (this is a continual problem not just a one off).Getting past whether the writer/director was aiming for this kind of film or if they stumbled into it, I have to credit the cast for making lemonade out of lemons. Dwayne Johnson is a bona fide movie star and he gives a decent performance. He tries as hard as he can, and he works in this more often than he doesn't. I thought Neve Campbell was pretty good, she had believable chemistry with Dwayne and she breathes life into what could be a stale character. Chin Han was solid, it was nice to see him in a bigger part and he does his job. Skyscraper doesn't do Noah Taylor or Roland Moller any favours in their respective roles as Mr. Pierce and Kores. I think Roland comes off a little better, but Noah is doomed by his higher profile and you can see where he's heading from moment one. I also felt bad for Pablo Schreiber as Ben, he's a great actor but he hasn't had the best of luck picking projects now that he's transitioning to movies.Skyscraper has a sizeable budget and the quality of the visual effects benefits for the most part. There was never a point that I was put off by a bad piece of CGI or disappointed from a visual standpoint. The movie has a few nice cinematography moments (they make the most out of the hall of mirrors room cliché) and the fights were okay. Dwayne wasn't 100 percent consistent in acting like an amputee (he's really limping in some scenes, in others not so much) but the action is passable. I do have plenty of complaints when it comes to Skyscraper, but I can't get deep into them without spoiling big moments in the film. Most of them centre around character motivations (is this really the easiest thing the terrorists could think of to get what they need?), character decisions (I admire Will's commitment to his family but considering what happens, why would he believe his family is still alive at the midpoint?) and really cheesy choices that undermine the thriller aspects of Skyscraper. They would have derailed the movie for me if I hadn't been having such a good time laughing and wondering where they would go next.I didn't give this movie a high rating, but I was genuinely surprised with how much fun I had with Skyscraper. Did I feel bad for giggling at the implausibility of the plot? A little... the theatre was 1/2 full but the friend I saw this with had the same reaction. Expectations are key when deciding to watch this movie. If you've seen some movies like Skyscraper, the plot twists are going to be obvious, the sentimentality is going to make your eyes roll (even if the actors and actresses are selling out to make it work), and there are going to be some head shaking moments that will try your patience. But I give the cast, the visual effects department and the screenwriter a pat on the back for doing their best and taking what could be a trainwreck into an enjoyable 1hr and 45minutes at the theatre. If you're looking for a turn-your-brain-off style action/thriller with high production values and a talented group of actors, this movie could scratch that type of itch.",Skyscraper

Dwayne Johnson saving his family from certain death - a skyscraper on fire - bad guys running around with guns - what more can you want eh?This movie is definitely entertaining, if not complex or deep at all. Due to the context of the skyscraper there are some hair raising set pieces, special effects and stunts. The action was at its best when Johnson was traversing the building. Aside from this however, the more generic gun/hand-to-hand was nothing astounding but was still fun. Speaking of the action it was well interspersed throughout the film - I never felt myself getting bored of it and it remained fun throughout.The plot for Skyscraper was fine - it made sense and there weren't really any glaring plot holes or errors which was nice. It zipped along at a decent pace and didn't spend too much time getting bogged down in unnecessary plot points or diversions. For the most part it gets straight to the point.Johnson was good as always - it's hard not to get on board with him in any film.

Dwayne Johnson i am always fan i loved him in WWE in olden days THE ROCK then when he became a actually actor in movies i liked and loved Doom, Scorpion King, Welcome to Jungle AKA Rundown, Walking Tall, Gridiron Gang, Faster, Snitch, GI Joe Retaliation, Pain & Gain, Fast and Furious films he is in, Hercules, Baywatch, San Andreas i liked OK but rather watch this movie over top then to San Andreas. I was always thinking Dwayne Johnson needs to be involved
more in Action with R RATED movies like this i am starting to sick and tried of him to be in PG i mean Baywatch is R RATED but why could this not be R ? because this felt like Die Hard Movie there was a lot violence in movie but not that much unless if it is R RATED. but anyway this movie was fun to watch Dwayne Johnson character is STRONG like something happens they made his character like he has to do it his family is in danger and Kidnapped he shows that he needs to do whatever needs to be done to risk his life to go tall and With a total height of 829.8 m (2,722 ft) and a roof height (excluding antenna) of 828 m (2,717 ft) with a prosthetic leg he has climbed a highest crank to get to building that is crazy isn't, I Thought Dwayne Character is Very Emotion and Series of What Is Happening In a Situation. Story Follows that Will Sawyer (Dwayne Johnson) a Former FBI Hostage Rescue Team Leader who was in very Risky Situation that father has kid with him as hostage strapped with C4 on his chest then Will tries to negotiate but father blew himself up Will Survives that's how he lost his leg he ended up with prosthetic leg which keeps him fully ambulatory and capable of walking and running, doctor was Sarah Sawyer (Neve Campbell) The Craft, Scream franchise, Wild Things that's how Sarah and Will met later on years they got married and got 2 kids, Will got involved in assesses security for skyscrapers, he talks in business tasked with inspecting ""The Pearl,"" which houses several floors that function as their own society, and despite numerous risks highlighted by Sawyer, his bosses insist that it is impenetrable. later on that's when thrilling and action starts the action and all movie is slaright FORWARD i thought i will fallsleep in halfway because it's soo modern and going to go for slow pace, thank god kept me awake for full on the action. another cast very surprised to see Inspector Wu (Byron Man) couple Steven Seagal's films Belly of Beast, True Justice, Dangerous Man, Absolution, Crying Freeman, Man with Iron Fist. he is in movie their and their he does get involved in action but not much, i thought villains it should have been better but villains aren't Kores Botha (Roland Møller) Atomic Blonde, The Commuter great not talented not like Alan Rickman In Die Hard or any others, Botha and his team of terrorists ignite the 96th floor of the building blocking access to all higher floors and knocking out the computer controlled advanced fire extinguishing hardware which was meticulously constructed throughout the skyscraper. The intense flames cause an impenetrable fire line on the 96th floor cutting off all rescue operations from below to assist survivors on the upper floors. i thought Will Kicked a lot and a lot ass in this movie killing all bad guys, axed them shoot them, him going out in mission to save his family in a very tall building is on fire, Will Is alone in the heights battling against the towering inferno trying to kill him. kicking the bad guys' butts while surviving the impossible situations. Very often that formula also included families. Die Hard, Commando, a lot a lot more... you know the stuff. Unfortunately, even though we still have a lot of action movies around, this exact kind of them somehow became obsolete. Those big muscular guys just aren't that popular anymore, theirs not many well their is a lot and a lot but as Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, Dave Basutia, Dolph Lundgren, Jean Claude Van Damme, Martin Ford, Steve Austin a lot more but people nowadays are looking still actors like Al Pacino and Robert De Niro you know little guys Jon Cryer, Benedict Cumberbatch but i don't care about that at all, everyone wants marvel movies little kids wants them as million dollar franchise i am like eh why ? this is something different a lot different to experience i love it that way. not Rambo, Commando, Bloodsport sadly everything needs to be that CGI and That very modern come on Seriously i wish this was traditional action with music in 80's and 90's action film style.

The strong family guy saving his family from the bad guys... there's just nothing like it. And guess what?

137,stevenrotherforth,Die Hard minus a leg!,6,26 January 2019,"SkyscraperSo if you want to make money at the box office just make a movie with Dwayne Johnson in it right?
Actually no!
Whilst Skyscraper wasn't a complete failure it wasn't the box office behemoth the producers would have liked, proving not everything The Rock touches will turn to gold.
Audiences aren't fooled so easily. Skyscraper is nothing more than a limp imitation of a certain 80's action classic that starred Bruce Willis.
Johnson plays a former FBI agent turned security expert who is taxed with the job of signing off the worlds largest building.
A super high tech Skyscraper in Hong Kong.
Will Sawyer (Johnson) must rescue his family from the giant building when terrorists take control.
Sounds familiar doesn't it?
Sawyer must rely on his former FBI skills to help save the day. The movie starts out showing why Sawyer has left the FBI.
An explosion causing him to lose one of his limbs.
You could say that this movie is a Die Hard rip-off minus a leg!
God only knows why those nasty terrorists want to burn down the Skyscraper.
I lost all interest in the weak storyline within the first fifteen minutes and just tried to enjoy the visuals.
This is perhaps where this movie shines.
It certainly is a good looking film.
Colours pop. A must watch in HDR. Flames and explosions have real vibrancy. The back drop of Hong Kong looks splendid with neon lights burning out of the screen.
The added clarity of 4K should elevate the CGI as the image is crisp with nicely saturated colours and deep blacks.
Sound is also good as an action movie of this kind should be.
Shame then that the film itself is just a poor rehash of better movies from decades ago.
Think Towering inferno meets the aforementioned Die Hard and you'll get the gist of the idea.
Despite the impressive image quality I certainly wouldn't rush out and buy this film on UHD Blu-ray.
Those discs cost an arm and a leg! (Pun intended).
However if you can rent this movie cheaply or watch it for free then it is worthy of your spare time.",Skyscraper
138,p-jonsson,"Decent if you are a fan of The Rock, if not...",6,16 December 2018,"Well, if you are a fan of The Rock this is a decent enough high octane action, disaster and special effects movie. If not, well then you probably have to be a pretty big fan of special effects and action to overlook its weak points.Let's start with the good stuff. One, it is The Rock (yes I am a fan) although he certainly doesn't come out at his best in this movie. Personally I could do without the artificial leg crap but it didn't bother me too much in the end. It didn't really add anything except some silly (and unrealistic scenes) though.Then we have the action and the special effects. They were as good as you would expect from a multi million dollar action movie. At least I enjoyed them. I really liked the design of the Skyscraper. I thought it was booth cool and beautiful. I kind of would like to see it built in real life.Was the movie derivative? Well of course it can be said to be derivative! How many movies with burning Skyscrapers and bad guys hi-jacking them can you make before it becomes derivative after all? The first movie named Skyscraper was made in 1928 for Christ sake. It didn't bother me at all.Now for the not so good. The movie was hugely predictable. I mean, you could tell who the bad guys were from the first scene they were in. Especially the rat faced jerk Mr Pierce. The main bad guy? Well, he was no Hans Gruber that's for sure. More like a common thug. The movie really lacked a bad guy with some charisma. Overall, most of the movie from start to finish was really a no-surprise-there event from the first bad guy entering the scene to the rebooting of the systems.Then we have the realism factor. I do not expect an action and special effects movie to be realistic but there are some limits. Sawyer climbing around on the outside of the building (with one leg remember) in the updraft from 50 or so burning levels was just nonsense. Also, a building burning that much and that long and yet all the electrical wiring and plumbing still working was a bit too much. The absolutely worst offence though was how everyone magically survived sitting in the middle of the fire being extinguished by the release of halon gas (or some equivalent). That just brings stupidity (or maybe laziness) in script writing to a whole new level.So, to sum it up, this move could have been a lot better. To me it was saved by The Rock and my love of special effects loaded action movies.",Skyscraper

141,kgprophet,The Rock has a Pretty Good Stunt Double,4,7 November 2018,"WARNING: Major SpoilersAfter a great amount of exposition, which makes little sense, we get a bunch of stunts performed in front of CGI effects that look more like a high-wire circus act than a believable action film. The convoluted plot involves trigger-happy bad guys killing people at some other facility that is supposed to be connected with a business meeting is taking place on the top floor of a 220 story skyscraper. It's not terribly important for this building to be so extra fascinating. In reality, all that matters for the story is that it has a working computer-operated fire suppression system.But lapses in logic occur. Our protagonist's family is in the building, now on fire. He sends his wife and one of the children down an elevator. Why not grab the other kid and all go down the elevator together? Wait, why is everybody on the ground just standing around? Where are the firemen, why aren't they trying to put out the fire? Yes there are trite explanations i'm sure for these lapses in logic, but it spends too much time with people in charge standing around. Just watching.Someone wanted this to be a Die Hard film but didn't come up with an interesting enough script. What the movie thinks is big flashy ending is really a dumb idea about having a confrontation with the bad guys in a house of mirrors. Once the bad guys are dealt with, instead of an action packed ending where Johnson fights the flames to get out of the burning building, he just sits there with his kid in the fire. In this case the wife is the hero by pressing a button.Dwayne Johnson is likable enough, and it's nice that Neve Campbell is getting some work. The kids are pretty generic. Chin Han is the guy who owns the skyscraper and is a recognizable face. With a plot that is not very interesting and only brief periods of action here and there, this film feels like a wannabe Die Hard flick with little going for it beyond The Rock.",Skyscraper

It's amazing that a 45 year old movie made in the pre-computer effects era manages to have more suspenseful fire sequences than this CGI mess.The only thing more dull than the plot (and I'm using that term generously) are the antagonists, who, of course, are mainly white even though the movie is set in China. Don't want to upset the dictatorship and lose out on that sweet Chinese box office.At least this movie got one thing right, and that was the Chinese characters using Baidu instead of Google to search the internet. The reason, of course, is that the Chinese dictatorship that Hollywood is pandering to, has blocked Google search and related services like Gmail. I would have loved to see one of the non-Chinese characters use a computer and enter the address to Google and find it blocked.

He just uses other people to boost his career, this time people with disabilities. This was just a bad movie. There is not one decent performance in the entire film. It's like canned Chef Boyardee vs. Rao's fresh made. It's horrendous. The lead is supposed to be missing a leg, but for most of the movie, no attempt is made to show this handicaps Will Sawyer. He can even jump off a crane into a high-rise. That got huge laughs from the audience. It was a foregone conclusion the sphere would have been where the final fight in the movie would take place, especially considering the unnecessary amount of random mirrors placed in the room for no good reason. I mean, at least make it a restaurant or lounge, which is far more believable. Maybe it was supposed to be one and I missed that, who knows.I really do believe this movie was created by a computer. There was noting original about it. I couldn't help myself imagining it was a prequel to The Dark Knight with Chin Han's character. It pretty much almost is the same character, lol. It was like a script was pumped out, actors were called the same morning to film their parts, get the movie made and this was the result. There was no soul. I couldn't even tell you what the plot was. I'm quite sure the villain's plan made no sense. I won't even get into it.The female Chinese assassin was the worst character in the movie. At no point did anyone take her seriously. She was a horrendous actress with terrible plastic surgery. Just skip this movie. My brother almost went to see it with me.

First Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Skyscraper. This is a very modern and up to date version of The Towering Inferno, but without the huge cast of stars, a different core plot and much much better effects. Dwayne Johnson plays Will Sawyer, ex military, ex FBI injured in a hostage situation. Ten years later we see him happily married to the Naval nurse who cared for him and assessing security in skyscrapers. Offered the biggest job of his career to sign off the security on The Pearl, the tallest building in the world, he travels to Hong Kong with his family. Unbeknownst to him the owner of the hotel has been targeted and a deadly plot to destroy the tower is underway. We are then drawn into the corniest disaster movie I have seen for a long time. There is nothing new, it has drawn together all the same old plot lines, and scenarios we have seen before, but the effects are awesome and I can honestly say I absolutely loved this film. Bad guys are gnarly and ugly and Dwayne Johnson is turning into rather a good watchable actor and I would happily watch it again.",Skyscraper

But it's a poor man's ""Die Hard"". Like, if that movie were a TV movie on the Syfy channel. The writing is absolutely terrible. The characters are bland and one-dimensional. There are no character flaws to overcome. I thought ""The main character has a mechanical leg. Is that going to be his crutch in the movie, both literally and figuratively?"" Nope! If anything, it gives him an advantage. He also never sees his mechanical leg as a flaw that he learns to appreciate. I thought ""Surely, as cliche as this trope is, he's going to be the dad that puts his career ahead of his family and learns to appreciate them?"" Nope. He's pretty decent. There are no character flaws to overcome, which makes for boring characters, which makes for a boring movie.

He plays an ex-soldier, ex FBI guy who suffered a terrible accident and changed careers to work on business security. He gets the break of a lifetime when an old contact gets him this dream contract to review the security on The Pearl, the world's tallest building ever, being built in Hong Kong.The cinematography was pretty cool, while the unique design of the tower was incredible. The CGI was excellent throughout, and helped make every scene seem lifelike as possible.The problem with Skyscraper is the plot. It's very thing. There's a rich guy, there are bad guys trying to take down the rich guy. There is some backstabbing going on that was revealed without giving you a second to think about it. There was a bad guy young woman who was taken right out of John Wick 2's same character, just this time of Asian descent. Guns, helicopters, grenades, and, oh yeah, fire, and lots of it. Stupid police made the movie even worse. They seemed totally inept in their jobs, chasing after the Rock for some stupid reason.The building, as it turns out, was not enough to save this movie. Of course there are family involved, led by Neve Campbell as the Rock's wife, who did a solid job of acting too. Her two kids were average, but she was pretty good, especially in this one fight scene in a car.So, solid acting, good CGI, but the story just wasn't good. There were too many holes in the plot. Why this, why that. that's so stupid. It made me think of the commercials with the dumb kids hiding from the Jason killer and they forgo the running car to go hide behind the deadly barn tools. You will find yourself screaming - why did you just do that? Are you stupid?Also, you should pay attention to the Rock's acting. He shows some really good skills in portraying limited mobility, and it really worked because he focused on that throughout. If you watch the Special Features, you will learn more and how he got high praise from his real-world trainer.I liked Skyscraper. It was entertaining, but if the plot could have just been better, like Die Hard, it would have been a much better film. Love the Rock.

(What???) Will has a prosthetic left leg and am not sure why his character has it. (But it did help keep certain doors open later on) This is as good as the first Die Hard movie without the language. (Yes, but the music by Vaughn Monroe was really good at Christmas time, and there was no such music in here) Tension abounds all through the movie. The acting by all is quite good, and the sets - either CGI or otherwise as that is always hard to tell these days - in the beginning are spectacular.Why was the fire set? Zhao (Chin Han) is the owner of the building, and he was blackmailed by Botha (Roland Moller) who would have stopped construction unless Zhao paid. Zhao did complete the 225 story building called The Pearl. Zhao countered Botha by getting files on all crime syndicates so he knew names and the money they held. Botha wants that file so he starts a fire to get it.You will see very good CGI and well-choreographed fights and stunts. Keep in mind that Will is at ground level and he has to climb up the skyscraper to rescue his family. Very tense scenes. I really had to hold onto my couch. (And you are afraid of heights, too) Dwayne Johnson really earns his money in this one. I was exhausted as he must have been. Notables: Neve Campbell as Sarah, Will's wife; Hannah Quinlivan as Xia, Botha's female enforcer who appears to be a dead shot regardless of her position when shooting; Pablo Schreiber as Ben, sort of a friend of Will's, but he betrays Will; Byron Mann as Inspector Wu who believes Will may have started the fire.The action is non-stop and quite good.

156,Olicosmic,Painfully uninspired and pointless,3,7 June 2019,"After seeing the posters and trailers for this film, I was excited, because I was expecting something epic with Dwayne Johnson, and seeing how thrilling this might look, I was hooked. Unfortunately, this is a major disappointment across the board. This is the very definition of a ""by-the-numbers"" action flick, as it is all flair, and no function. Style, and no substance. Looks, and no brains. You get the point. This has one of the most basic setups in movie history, the story is unrealistic and stupid, the script is somewhat poor, the direction is out of whack, which the performances suffer from, as even the best actors don't really give it their all, thanks to what they were working with, and there's just never really any take away whatsoever. It's as basic of an action movie can get, and it never really justifies its existence or really adds anything to the genre whatsoever. Action films from years ago have done everything this film has done, but even better. One thing I guess I can give credit to are the visuals, as they do look very pretty and well detailed. The film set, itself, is also pretty well done. But, really, that's about it. This film cares more about how it looks and feels than actually having anything special about it, and because of this, it fails astronomically hard to leave an impact whatsoever, and just comes off as extremely uninspired and pointless. I wanted to like, even love this film, but there's nothing that really sticks out when everything has been done already countless times, as well as done better. I can't in good conscience recommend this film when there are countless other action films, such as ""Die Hard"", that are better than this uninspired garbage in just about every way. Do yourself a favor, and just not worry about this painfully uninspired and pointless folly, as there's really not much of value here.",Skyscraper

161,Jared_Andrews,"The Rock is Awesome, but this Movie is Mediocre",4,17 July 2018,"Since no human adversary is any match for The Rock, as he has shown us in past movies, he must now take on non-human adversaries. This time, he's taking on a building. But not just any building. He's taking on a skyscraper-the most formidable and the most phallic of all buildings. If it sounds ridiculous, that's because it is. The story is largely ridiculous, and although The Rock never actually fights the building (because it's a building), the danger that the building poses is a much greater threat than any posed by the actual villains of this film.The villains are lame, cardboard cutout characters. They're evil because they're evil-no explanation given, no effort. So, I consider the skyscraper the main adversary in this film since its sheer height and the raging fire it contains threatens The Rock's family. I won't mention The Rock's character's name because I never once thought of him as anyone other than The Rock. The only thing here distinguishing him from the characters he plays in other movies, is his love for duct tape. This is a very pro-duct tape movie.In this movie, The Rock is awesome because The Rock is always awesome. Speaking of awesome, I have to give it up for Neve Campbell. I should have known from the many times I watched the 'Scream' movies, but Neve Campbell is one tough cookie. She takes down her share of bad guys along the way, fearlessly and intelligently defending her kids. Well done.Rooting for The Rock (and any of his friends or family) is one of my favorite things to do at the movies. It's amazing that The Rock has been so built up in the minds of viewers as an indestructible force that writers now have to manufacture weaknesses for him in movies, such as an artificial leg. It's as if the audience would believe all the challenges of this movie would be too easy for him if he had both his natural legs. While there are a million and one plot holes, that's definitely not something you're supposed to look for in this movie. Certain movies are not meant to be dissected, and one involving a man jumping from one tall structure across the sky into a much taller structure that's on fire, is certainly one of them. In addition to the film's inherent silliness, it also attempted several awkward jokes within the first few minutes, all of which whiffed. Characters followed up with ""I'm kidding.""

162,springsunnywinter,Decent flick but fails to scrape the sky,7,12 July 2018,I was expecting this to be a decent rehash of die hard as in an action film that takes place in a tall building but it turned out to be an extended version of the buraj khalifa scene in Mission Impossible 4. The biggest problem with this movie is that it is a hang on for your life thriller rather than an action film. The building had no hostages which didn't create any tension or thrills for the movie and Dwane's character knew is way around the building before the pearl building was hijacked.Overall it wasn't bad either and was entertaining and I would'n't watch it again.,Skyscraper

Heights don't bother me that much but I can see my stomach clenching hanging from the high in the air.Skyscraper is what people call The Towering Inferno meets Die Hard starring The Rock. The film starts off with a quick scene where The Rock is in some special forces group with his buddy, and then they they get blown up. We see Rock in the hospital and he had lost his leg. However, he meets with his future wife, Ms Scream herself, Neve Campbell (good she's still working these days).Flash forward and the two are married and have two kids together. The Rock sees them off (""Daddy loves who?"") and then meets with his buddy. They meet with the head of that building, and then we learn that his buddy is betraying him over a tablet that takes control of the building. The Rock is too smart, so his buddy tries to kill him but remembers that the movie would be over if he kills The Rock.Naturally, Rock wins but terrorists have taken over the building, set it on fire, and his family is trapped in it. However, Hong Kong police are chasing after him so The Rock races against the cops, time, and those terrorists to get his family back. First its the scene from the trailers where he jumps to the building on a crane. This is high level action right here. I can see why they are proud of this because it was a very suspenseful, energetic action scene. The movie never lets up until the very end and because I was never bored and expecting Shakespeare, I walked away thinking the film is awesome.Is this movie better than Die Hard and Towering Inferno. Oh heck no. Those movies are classics for a reason. However, this is an entertaining action film and that's what I expect out of the summer.",Skyscraper

170,MinistryofDoom,I love Dwayne Johnson but this film thoroughly stinks,1,21 August 2018,"And I don't blame Johnson for this film's failure. He's a great action star doing what he supposed to do. The problem is that the writing is absolutely horrendous. Dwayne Johnson plays Will Sawyer a former FBI taskforce leader who was injured on the job and forced to retire. Now an amputee, thanks to some nifty CGI work, he's a security analyst and safety inspector for skyscrapers. On the job in Hong Kong, he is tasked with assessing the safety of the world's tallest skyscraper - basically a city inside a building (about 220 floors). He brings his family with him who are staying in a suite on the 90-something floor. However, suddenly we're introduced to a gang of highly advanced, well-organized militant terrorists who infiltrate the building, set it on fire and blame Johnson for the fire. We don't know who these guys are, who they work for, why they're attacking the building, what they have against Sawyer, or the owner of the building...nothing. It's just a bunch of people double-crossing and killing each other and carrying out terrorist actions for some reason that we're left in the dark about until very late into the film. This is mainly the fault of the writing. It tries to take every action film cliche and rolls them into one film expecting greatness...but it doesn't work. For his part, Dwayne is great, although the dynamic between him and Neve Campbell, who plays his wife, is as forced as a square peg in a round hole. It's not believable, there's no emotional connection and it makes us really not care about them as a family. As well, Skyscraper takes very obvious cues from films like Mission Impossible, the 007 films, particularly those of Pierce Brosnan, and of course the most obvious is it's heavy references to Bruce Willis' Die Hard series. That's all great....if it is done right but in this instance: no, it's not done right. Some scenes look like a blatant rip-off of scenes from the Die Hard films, and that's disappointing because instead of telling a good original story, it focuses on being a new iteration on a tired out action trope.",Skyscraper

""Skyscraper"" is a guilty-pleasure as it takes itself just seriously enough, and Dwayne Johnson is perfect in those kind of movies. The result is a competent action film that serves up some good enough moments. But the truth is that ""Skyscraper"" takes elements from many of action blockbusters and disaster movies and mixes them together in a way that makes the movie unoriginal, even though Dwayne Johnson does his best with this material.",Skyscraper
172,lotekguy-1,Dwayne Does Die Hard...Disappointingly,4,12 July 2018,"As a lifelong sports fan I oughta understand jinxes by now. In my last review of a movie starring Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Rampage, I half-jokingly supported his rumored thoughts about running for President, due to his consistently sound judgment in choosing projects. JINX! I may have caused this family-friendly action flick to go off the rails by praising his picking power prematurely. In this opus, The Rock is a former FBI crisis stud who lost his lower left leg in a hostage situation that ended with a bang. The wrong kind. Now he's a security consultant who flies to Hong Kong with his wife and two kids to double-check the systems for a 200+ story building that's about to open its upper floors of luxury condos. Bad guys have other plans that begin with hacking the controls and starting a fire about halfway up. Guess whose family just happens to be in one of the imperiled apartments?Which demographic has the best chance of enjoying this attempt at a blockbuster? We start with the many millions of ardent fans of The Rock. But the focus must shift quickly to those who've never seen Die Hard, 'cause Bruce Willis gave us a lot more gore and guffaws than anyone will find in this descendant of the concept. I suspect the area of overlap on the Venn diagram of those two circles is rather tiny.The eponymous building is amazingly, if not excessively, complex, making all the heroics therein hard to follow. Every bit of the budget and thought seemingly went to computer graphics, with nothing left for plot or character development. Or dialog. It all looks great, but more in the sci-fi realm than intended. The only upside from the Die Hard franchise is that Mrs. The Rock, Neve Campbell, contributes more actively to the rescue and villain foiling than Bonnie Bedelia's Holly McClane. Another win for Me Too, however Pyrrhic the package renders it.",Skyscraper

174,plasticanimalz,It's My Fault For Watching It,5,9 August 2019,"The trailer didn't look good. It tanked at the box office. One person told me it was good so I tried it, since it was free and not on my dime. Dwayne Johnson & Liam Neeson are my guilty pleasure go-to when I'm not sure what to watch or can't find anything. Some of their films are good, and others are at least usually enjoyable. Liam Neeson is basically the same story in different vehicles. But, most action movies suck, so, you can at least count on Dwayne and Liam. This was clearly plotted out in a room and then a writer wrote it in a couple nights. Every moment was formulaic and predictable. I shut it off in the last 10 minutes, 'cause, everybody's saved and nothing new was going to happen.The only plus was Neve Campbell. I guess she came out of temporary retirement while she was having a baby, or transitioning into ""mom"" roles where she waits at home for the hero to save her. She still has the same charm and looked great despite the film giving her almost nothing to do. Dwayne, who usually makes the films he's in, maybe he wasn't into this film either, or they gave him no room to be Dwayne, 'cause he wasn't much other than a muscle guy, running around, doing things so impossible it really took away from the film. What makes Bruce Willis and Jackie Chan enjoyable is they get the crap kicked out of them and are not invincible. Like, Dwayne does one impossible thing after they other, then one much smaller guy punches him in the gut and he's really down for the count.The building was cool. Maybe this is just a corporate advertisement to get approval to build structures like this. A lot of movies are just big toy ads, and this is what this felt like, with a structure. I think I've possibly seen all of Dwayne's films, and this is one to miss. It's basically, Die Hard but boring and every cliche trope from any action movie ever.",Skyscraper
175,lucasnochez,Film Review: Skyscraper/www.nightfilmreviews.com,5,30 October 2018,"Whatever you do, don't look down!Hope that you aren't scared of heights, because if you are, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson's newest film might be a little hard for you to swallow and watch.The hardest working actor in Hollywood is back, and this time, teaming up with the man behind the hit cult comedy Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story and We're The Millers. But instead for opting for a straight up comedy, the two team up to deliver a Die Hard inspired and overly-stylized The Towering Inferno film that is meant to be the ultimate summer movie. Skyscraper is blockbuster, Hollywood entertainment like we have never seen before. Taking cues from the best and worst summer blockbusters before it, Skyscraper is a non-stop, high octane, adrenaline filled popcorn flick for everyone.Like any movie Dwayne Johnson does in his career at this point, he adds his undeniable charm and heart into each and every project, and the same could be felt with his newest. What makes Johnson's Will Swayer so likeable, aside from the fact that he is the ultimate family man, who will back down to no challenge involving his family, is the fact that he is modelled like any family man before him. Relinquishing his duties form the military following a rescue mission gone wrong, Will is faced to live the rest of his life with only one leg. Luckily for him, with every painful path in life, comes beauty. Sparking a romance with the doctor who saved his life, Will finds his life ten years later in Hong Kong, as a security assessment official, who must now give his expertise and knowledge to the largest free-standing building in the world, The Pearl. With a little help from an old friend Ben (Pablo Schreiber), Will pitches his small-business motto to Zhao Long Ji (Chin Han), the architect behind The Pearl, only to land the biggest deal of his life. Excited to share the news with his family, Will celebrates his big accomplishment with his best firmed Ben, only to find that The Pearl has been taken hostage and set ablaze, with his family still in it.From the first day of production, Skyscraper was always hailed as a homage to so many high-rise tension filled films before it. While no one ever believes anyone will be able to replace John McClane, Johnson is easily a very comparable action star with massive commercial appeal. Oozing with charisma and charm, Johnson's character will not only becomes likeable for his personal quality traits and his unpardonable love for his family, but I'm sure that one of the biggest selling points of this film, was the fact that Johnson's character is in fact, disabled. It is almost unheard of that action stars are in fact, disabled ex-military personnel who are still capable of kicking butt and beating bad guys. Not only does Johnson play Sawyer with class and bravado, but the film also highlights many times where his prosthetic legs becomes a tool for rescuing his family, as opposed to a weakness. This narrative driving force, and this one alone, is one of my favourite and most enjoyable, as well as respectable character traits, in recent memory in the summer blockbuster genre.It is no surprise that Hollywood loves Johnson right now, inflicting him into, practically, every franchise available at the moment. With that said, it has come to a surprise to me that Johnson has not been inducted into the MCU yet, but I am sure time will tell.While many would be surprised to seer Neve Campbell cast as Sarah Sawyer, Johnson's wife in the film, it only goes to show how powerful Johnson's presence is on screen, even when actors who have been absent from the silver screen are able to come back to revive their careers for smaller roles like this one. While the only name that matters on the movie posters may be Johnson's, one of the best actors cast in the film is a person favourite of mine, Roland Møller, the certified baddie in Skyscraper. While Møller's Kores Botha doesn't have much intent, fibre or much to do or say within the film, but it is always great seeing foreign actors breaking through into Hollywood films. Møller was astonishing in one of my favourite foreign films in the last couple years in Land of Mine.Skyscraper surely will have many palms sweating, many hearts racing and people forcing themselves to cover their eyes thanks to some very crazy and absurd stunt work and visual effects of Will Sawyer jumping, dangling and racing in and around the fictional largest building in the world. Skyscraper is the typical escapist summer blockbuster film of the year, and one that, for maybe two hours out of your summer, will be a satisfying retreat into the air-conditioned theatre away from the heat that is outside, even if more than half the action in the film is borderline ridiculous.Skyscraper is just another entry into the very expansive filmography of Dwayne Johnson, further reinforcing just how wonderfully suave and likeable he really is. If you don't like Johnson now, you better, because by the looks of it, he isn't going anywhere for a long time.Buckle up, fasten your seatbelts and enjoy the ride because Skyscraper will have your face melting by the time the end credits roll, thanks to all the gravity-defying, absolutely absurd action and set pieces that will surely have you squirming in your seat.",Skyscraper

Dwayne Johnson plays his role very well. A man who has retired from action, but the safety of his family makes him overcome his physical disabilty and he fights for them. The movie made me cry in some occasions, the reason is because I was devastated due to the fires in Athens Greece and the fire victims and I had no idea I was going to watch a movie about fire. So I left the theatre in tears. It was a very intense movie. It deserves a better rate because it has to be judged on what it is. An action movie. So I rated it with 9 stars.

The acting and lines were just bland, like it was made by a badly written computer program. Also, I think Johnson needs to find some good writers and become best friend with them... He is probably the most popular action actor today (along with Vin Diesel) yet to this day, he has yet to play any memorable rolls. Every action hero had their iffy movies but most have at least 1 or 2 good roles that everyone remembers. Arnold had Terminator, Predator, Twins, and Conan. Stallone had Rocky, Cop Land, and Demolition Man. Vin has Riddick, XXX, & F&F. Johnson is all crickets... I cant even remember any of his past movies except Moana where he was only a voice actor.

As an added bonus, the skyscraper in play is the tallest structure in the whole-wide world, it's the dream of a good-hearted billionaire, and it's on fire, so we're definitely gonna win.Dwayne Johnson plays Will Sawyer, an everyday everyman, a hero who loves his family so much that he'll climb roughly 96 stories of a construction crane to save them. Skyscraper is a hard mix of Enter the Dragon, Die Hard, and a little The Towering Inferno. Will Sawyer is relatively a hard mix of Bruce Lee, Bruce Willis, and O.J. Simpson. He's also part Rambo, mostly Ninja Warrior, and a dash of Jackie Chan.Spoiler alert: Skyscraper has a plot, but I don't remember how it goes. Something about a MacGuffin and a building on fire.

Though I am nearly 100% straight, if I was stuck with a life sentence in a Turkish prison with the Rock, well, who knows what might go down. Jokes aside, he just makes passionate, heartfelt movies with enough financial backing to make them not only good enough, but the perfect escape to the human condition: fantasies masquerading as real life well enough to ""suspend disbelief,"" as they say. Skyscraper, like San Andreas Fault, is another in a great series of Rock movies. Admittedly, to ""suspend"" one must also be three bong tokes and three glasses of wine in before pressing play, amazingly, I enjoyed this one thoroughly after only two bong tokes and two glasses of wine in. This means Skyscraper is a bit above the rest. It's Big Daddy Rock saving the universe, but it's also great as a recap of the first Die Hard, with sprinkling sweet reminisces of the Poseidon Adventure (yes, yes, I understand the retort: ""But that movie had Earnest Borgnine and Shelly Winters in it!"" This is true. But Gene Hackman played our beloved protagonist, which trumps all, in any movie, ever). It's pure movie crack. And though that observation might at first glance appear both cliched and trite, it's actually quite hard to accomplish. John Cusack managed it in 2012, but most tries turn into fails. The producers and executives will never, ever understand this, as they are businesspeople first and artists/visionaries...never. This is why none of the Star Wars films reached mythological status, as the first three did. The gatekeepers are just too stupid to see what is right in front of their face.",Skyscraper
199,trevorwomble,Very predictable take on the 'Die Hard' formula,6,20 July 2018,"I did have high hopes for this film. It was pitched as a Die Hard/Towering Inferno mash up starring Hollywood's most bankable and likeable star with state of the art special effects. Unfortunately I found it to be quite ham fisted in places and instantly forgettable.Any number of actors could have played the lead role but Dwayne Johnson gotthe nod in this case and Johnson does his best to take his character seriously despite the cheesy plot, although I could quite easily have seen somebody like Jason Statham in the role. All the outrage over the fact his character has a physical disability seems a little bit unfair as Johnson probably thought it would if anything be interesting to attempt something different and give his character a realistic obstacle to deal with. I don't have a problem with that, the biggest issue to me is that other than the disability angle this is the type of film that Hollywood was knocking out 25-30 years ago with the likes of Schwarzenegger/Stallone/Van Damme/Willis in the main role. Even the baddies were the usual mix of euro-villains with the token Englishman as a particularly slimy character (but missing the class and wit of the late Alan Rickman).This film feels like a misfire for me. Johnson and Campbell acquit themselves ok but their two dimensional children feel like they've been cut and pasted out of one of Irwin Allen's more fun 1970s disaster epics. The Hong Kong setting and Chinese supporting actors feel shoehorned in order to let the film get an audience in the Chinese market (no prizes for guessing that this film is an American-Chinese co-production).The set pieces are well done if predictable, the visual effects are also impressive but it's all been done before in better films. Releasing this in the summer seems like a bad mistake by Universal when it will be attempting to find the same audience that Marvel, Disney and the Jurassic Park franchise will already have wrapped up. It should have been released outside of the holiday season when it would have found a bigger market as there would be less competition in the family friendly action movie market. It may well do ok in the Chinese market but i'm afraid I was not overly impressed.",Skyscraper

Ten years after a hostage situation went bad and cost Will part of his leg, he is about to make a bid to a wealthy industrialist which will be a huge boost to his fledgling Security Assessment business.The building in question is known as ""The Pearl"" and it is a multi-billion dollar wonder that towers over the Hong Kong skyline. The lower levels are open for consumer shops and other residents, but the assessment is needed in order to obtain the needed permissions to open the higher levels, and thanks to his former teammate Ben (Pablo Schreiber), has recommended Will which has allowed him to get into the mix for the job which usually goes to much larger and better established companies.Upon meeting his potential new boss Zhao Long Ji (Chin Han), Will is able to impress him and is given a tablet customized to his facial ID which will allow him to remotely access the building systems.
On his way to tour the off-site monitoring office which is the last step needed for Will to fully sign off on the building, he is mugged and has his bag stolen. Will fortunately had the tablet on him which soon has him running for his life from a group of deadly individuals as well as the police who believe Will is behind the mysterious fire and system outages that have hit the Pearl in his absence as all the computer safeguards have been disabled by a group of armed individuals.As if things were not bad enough for Will, he has to get into the burning building as his wife and children are trapped inside and he is their best hope for survival.In a race against time, Will must face big odds, fire, and the dizzying heights of the building in order to save the day and rescue his family.The poster and marketing efforts for the film made many believe it was simply an updated ""Die Hard"" but it is actually more than that. To me it was a mix of ""The Towering Inferno"" with elements of ""Die Hard"" but tells a more personal tale without skimping on the action. The film does have some great stunt session and tension but is not an over the top action film nor is it filled with sequences that make you roll your eyes with their stretching of credibility.
The likeability of Johnson is a big key to the film and Neve Campbell is very refreshing as his wife as she is not a typical Damsel in distress but rather a strong woman who is more than capable of holding her own in the worst of situations.What really stood out to me were the numerous times that my mind was sure Green Screen technology was used to portray the precarious heights but I was able to truly believe what I was seeing was really happening.
The film does follow some of the standard action film checklists but does give users an enjoyable and intense summer movie experience which should be enough to make the film a success.3.5 stars out of 5",Skyscraper

I see the similarities, but I'm still scoring this film a 7 because they added enough original ideas and differences that it's still kind of its own movie. I mean this is 2018 after all and I think it's safe to say that theres a lot more sensitivity for minorities than there was back when the original Diehard was made: insert one amputee main character played by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. I'm really curious which will be more watched by the amputee community this movie or the special olympics! Both give massive props to a minority-group that I believe deserves a lot of respect!
This isn't the best acting job I've seen from The Rock, but he sure gets one heck of a workout in this epic mission to save his wife and kids!
Maybe I'm easily impressed by CGI, but the design of the Pearl was breathtaking in a lot of ways. Sure it's kind of hokey to make this fictional building the tallest building in the world, but the details on it had some real wow-factor for me.
The director was definitely a martial arts fan with the modernized ""Enter The Dragon"" throwback. You could see it coming a mile away that when he showed him the room full of mirrors the final action-scene of the movie would inevitably end up there.

Once the thrills begin, they do not stop, but even when the action is broken up with story, its not done so badly like its done in so many others who shall remain nameless, it was very smooth. The Rock delivers one of his best performances, and while there were jokes, it wasn't silly and stupid like his other roles have been. And while there were a couple parts that were either fantastical (meaning they are probably not possible) or decisions that I personally would not have made, it really didn't bother me because it was so very cool.What I liked, and clearly what others have noticed, is that it was very classic 80's and 90's action film. From the gun fights, to the one-liners, to the hair raising scenarios, it all was clearly influenced by films like Die Hard but thankfully it didn't just simply copy it, it was unique in its own right.

223,PerryAtTheMovies,A film that reaches crazy heights....,6,21 February 2021,"Initial Thoughts:
I've been putting off watching this movie for a long time, because when I initially saw the trailer back in 2018. I thought to myself, ""This is probably one of the most ridiculous movie concepts I've ever heard."" I wasn't wrong and even after watching it I still think that way. However, this past Christmas I got a book called, ""For Your Consideration: Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson"", and what this book helped me realize is that actors usually go for the movies that fit their strong suits. ""Well duh"" you might say, but I never really though of it in this way before. Now I am catching up with the times.So what does a Dwayne Johnson movie usually have? While not necessarily narrowed down to these three aspects, his films usually have explosions. Lots of them. Ridiculous stunts that seem out of this world. Lastly, in one form or another family. ""Skyscraper"" has all three of these aspects.First I will start with the explosions of the film. They were massive. They were wildly unbelievable. Yet, they are presented to us in such a way that it goes well with this story and doesn't seem so far fetched when you realize that the director wants to go for boom rather than realism. Second, I want to focus on the stunts. When DJ is climbing that crane, sprawling around the side of a building, and hanging on for dear life, my hands were sweating and heart was racing the entire time. Were the stunts the most outlandish thing I've ever seen? Yes, but again they worked well for the direction of the film. Lastly, I'd like to touch on family. If you're a fan of Dwayne Johnson and follow him on social media, you'll know that he loves his family dearly and that they mean the world to him. In this film it feels no different. He loves his family so much that he's willing to climb a crane, jump 50 some odd feet into a burning skyscraper, mission impossible himself out a window and around a building in an array of impossible feat of strength to save his family whether it's all believably possible or not. All to say, he loves flexing his muscle to save the thing he loves most. Family.While the core of the film is good there are definitely downsides. I'm not saying it is possible, but all the stunts that involve the prosthetic leg seem unbelievable. Even with two good legs I don't think some of the stunts would be possible. Yeah, some of them were cool, but were also truly unbelievable due to the fact that his character does have that prosthetic leg. Before the end, I did that wish that DJ's character would be tossed into a chasm and die, even though, I would hate to see a Dwayne Johnson character die. The other big thing that kind of made me upset about this film is the building being on fire. There's so much smoke that any character would literally be suffocating due to smoke inhalation. Especially, the son who already suffers from asthma. One moment he has difficulty breathing the next he's fine and screaming words at the top of his lungs. For me, poor consistency on breathing in the smoky air. I digress, however, as it is a Dwayne Johnson film that is meant to be way over the top.Overall:
A really good film that offers explosions, edge of you seat excitement, and obviously, a happy ending. While the film is over the top. It is to be expected as a Dwayne Johnson film. Especially, if you're a fan of his, I don't think you'll be disappointed.""Should I watch this movie?"" My answer is a resounding 'Yes'.Enjoy the show!",Skyscraper

Because that's exactly what you're gonna get with Skyscraper!Dwayne Johnson plays Will Sawyer, a former FBI Hostage Rescue agent who lost his leg 10 years prior in a mission that went wrong. He gave up FBI and went into security analysis.In the present day (which appears to be future), in Hong Kong, a Chinese businessman named Zhao has built a new skyscraper called The Pearl, which is the tallest building in the world (I can hear the ""Yep, Towering Inferno"" groans). The lower half (the first 95 floors) are open to the public. The remaining floors - all residential - are closed off pending Sawyer's analysis (although Sawyer's family are staying above the 96th floor).However, a notorious Scandinavian terrorist sets the building ablaze - trapping Sawyer's family (and Zhao) above the fireline. And Sawyer has been framed for the arson. He must save his family and find and stop the bad guys.The movie is VERY tense and exciting, and hugely fun to watch. I love all of Sawyer's near-misses - they create so much tension. Johnson's acting is brilliant, as usual. But this time he is more authentic, more real.

245,tom-456,"An unintelligible, incomprehensible mess",2,1 August 2021,"I tried to watch this movie on cable, on FX. I was looking forward to it, thinking it would be fun to watch, but just a few minutes into the movie I found myself turning the volume down, then up again, then down again, then up again, and this didn't last more than about fifteen minutes before I gave up and switched the channel. The actors do not enunciate. This is a common flaw of many modern movies, but was a rare occurrence with older movies. You rarely find an older movie where there is any difficulty understanding the dialog, but with many modern movies, this is a common problem. The problem starts with the actors not making any effort to clearly enunciate their lines, then this problem is compounded by the sound engineers. The sound engineers apparently start by compressing the dialog track and eliminating the high and low frequencies in the dialog, then they mix this together with sound effects but they set the sound effects volume much, much too loud in relation to the dialog volume. The sound effects are so loud that it is downright unpleasant, while the dialog is so quiet as to be unintelligible, which compounds the problem with the actors not enunciating their lines to begin with. What you end up with is something that they ought to just throw straight in the trash, because the trash is where it belongs. The reason that FX chose the movie is probably the name appeal of the main star. But there is more that is wrong with this movie. The script is awful, the dialog is awful, the acting is awful, the directing is awful, the technical aspects are awful. This movie epitomizes a class of movie that is all too common nowadays, where nothing is assumed to matter other than the action and the box office appeal of the main star. So long as you have non-stop action, especially lots of explosions, and the main actor has strong box office appeal, it does not matter how bad the script is, how badly the acting is, how badly the actors mumble through through their lines just to get it done, how bad the directing is, and how bad the editing is, especially the sound editing so long as the explosions are a whole lot louder than the dialog. Skyscraper epitomizes the modern movie of this worthless genre. It is the worst of the worst. The worst I've watched, or rather tried to watch, in a long while. What the director apparently does not understand is that there are good action movies where the script is good to begin with, where the actors enunciate and are required by the director to do so, and where the sound editing is done so that the sound effects are only modestly louder than the dialog, so that you don't have to keep turning the volume up and down every few seconds so that the explosions are tolerable while you still have a chance of understanding the dialog. The director has made some good movies, but this is certainly not one of them.",Skyscraper

I can imagine those who went to the theatre were disappointed. Even my friend who rented it, was a bit pissed. But with a beer in our hands, giving comments we still had a good enough movie time. I payed for the beers ;)Don't expect more than just an average action flick; One misunderstood good guy, who has to do it on his own to save his family and to stop a gang of villains while a (empty) skyscraper is burning up.My problem, why not just go all the way. This could have been a perfect blend of something like Die Hard and Tower Inferno. But no, it's just The Rock doing stunts while missing a leg (not a spoiler, the movie starts that way).
And that's another problem, there's not enough humor, and what the production team thought was humoristic doesn't work. f.e. the things he does with his prostetic leg or just one legged. Believe me, it sounds more fun writing this than what really goes on with that gadget in the movie.

251,jordanthomas_2009-346-914758,Cliché Generic Fun,6,22 August 2018,"Skyscraper Review 6/10Dwayne Johnson plays a retired SWAT officer who now works as a security expert. He is assigned to examine the infrastructure of The Pearl, the worlds tallest most technically advanced building. But before he can finish the job it gets taken over by a bunch of terrorists who set it ablaze. He has to make his way back into the burning building to save his family and the only way he can get there is by climbing a crane and jumping off the edge of it. The film opens with a similar opening to Cliffhanger where our lead (Johnson) fails to save someone's life. A lot of film makers try to throw us off guard with such unpredictable openings but we already know where this film will go. It's generic and serviceable but Dwayne Johnson proves once again why he is a star. He really knows how to carry a movie and he is in his comfort zone here but he's ultimately let down by a predictable, poorly written script. It tries too hard to mimic similar films like The Towering Inferno and Die Hard. If it wasn't for Johnson it would be completely unwatchable. One good thing about it is our hero takes a beating throughout and he gets in some tricky situations with his prosthetic leg. There are some good action scenes and some of them are quite tense but somehow we always know what the outcome will be because it's been done a hundred times before. Now other than the main character there is very little character development. The villain is one dimensional and we never really understand his motivations. To an extent it's an enjoyable film with a few fun moments however it's scattered with flaws from unrealistic action scenes, some needless CGI and a thin plot.",Skyscraper
252,iamianiman,Skyscraper fails to be praised as high as its building.,6,11 July 2018,"Skyscraper is the kind of movie that renders bad trailers but the actual product is underrated. It's quite gripping and unexpected compared to the awful damn trailers. It's nothing outstanding but also to say it's a bad movie is a total understatement.It pulls off a refreshing and original concept to grasp the audience's attention. The tallest building in the world whereby a married man with a dark past in progress to generate the most sophisticated security, only to discover that a group of terrorists is targeting the building and the people inside it. Realizing that the security is yet to prepare, he must be willing to sacrifice himself for the protection of the people and his family. Hearing this, at least it's not another remake or reboot or prequel or sequel.I love on its take of borrowing ideas and subtly use other movies' WOW moments like the mirror room in John Wick, the Fast and Furious fighting styles at one scene, the Mission Impossible 4's Burj Khalifa's scene and Blade Runner 2049's quite-like Memory Room.The Rock's acting has significantly improved from his last movie, Rampage. His face is getting better on finding its place with the little details of emotions. P.S: He's just an annoying bloke in Jumanji.One thing that I extremely hate is the cinematography, of course there are a few times that those scenes make you shiver down your spine but most of 'em feel like I'm watching Jason Bourne (Bourne 5), the cameras like literally zoom in that you can't really see what's happening on the background and the ambience. But it's worth it to watch in IMAX, though.Another thing I dislike is the ending....lazy ending, not a cliffhanger but lazy.Skyscraper succeeds in marketing strategies, opting The Rock as the hero to persuade Americans, British, Australians to see this movie and construct the building in Hong Kong to produce high grossing in China which can contribute much money for a movie.",Skyscraper

However, the reason why I watched it was because I was kind of tired of watching only art films for a whole week and I was in the mood to see something completely commercial for once. So I did it. And what I think is that it is a perfectly watchable, if not remarkable, movie that has some exciting moments mixed with some boring ones (I was sleeping a bit, I admit it), nice performance from Dwayne, I think this is one of his most serious roles. The visual effects were average, but in a few scenes they provide the tension they needed to make, especially at the last minutes.The script was decent, if not great, and the plot was quite good for the type of movie this is.Overall, it's by no means a great movie, but still, it is fun to watch if you want to have a nice pop corn time.Peace!",Skyscraper

260,Randy_Dreammaker,"This movie is like buying a Big Mac with fries, but receiving a veggie corn dog.",6,8 September 2018,"Skyscraper has quite a few weaknesses for a film of this genre that the Bruce Willis films set the standard for.Even in terms of this genre of films featuring Duane ""The Rock"", it has some serious issues.At best, (and I didn't peak to see where this was produced) it reminds me of some of the substandard Hong Kong movies the Jackie Chan appears in.1.) Acting of the Asian actors (actresses) was pretty mediocre and sub-par, especially the male and female leads.2.) Acting of the Asian lead actresses bad woman was also low quality.3.) Acting of the two children playing Duane's daughter and son was mind numbingly unrealistic, and subdued given the fiercely dramatic and life threatening circumstances. Whoever cast these children should find a new job. Through the entire movie, it felt more like two kids whose kitten was stuck in a tree, than their being in the most horrible and dire situations any human of any age could be placed in. It felt more like these children were cast more for their cultural identity rather than their acting experience.4.) Overall the story was a decent story, it had a ton of potential, put together with some incredible cinematography, but with week link acting it simply didn't work together enough to make this movie the groundbreaking theatrical thriller suspense film it could have been. Much of the problems outside of simply having lots of poor acting, the blame for the lack of this films success falls entirely on its director (whoever it was, I didn't bother checking between having just watched this movie, and now writing my review thoughts). 
 
5.) This movies incredible cinematography was wasted on some horrible directing decisions. The cinematographer could be partly to blame, but the director is always the chief on the set make all of the calls on the shots, and this films director played it way to safe, with poor scene selections, missed opportunities of framing that would have really made the fire and action intense and captivating. One of the worst decisions, and this may be shared between the director and editor (its difficult to know, because some directors override editor decisions), and that is the repetitive cuts between the drama and suspense between ""The Rock"" and a crowd of onlookers who are supposedly somewhere at ground level never the Skyscraper watching the events unfold on a massive video screen. These cuts, entirely kill the momentum and distract from the action and intensity occurring, and are ultimately one of this movies greatest weaknesses in addition to the subpar acting.I was hoping to love this movie, but I came away feeling schwindled, like one of those advertisements in a kids comic books that promises to send you a real live ghost for $7.99 plus shipping, and all you get is a piece of plastic sheeting and a string.",Skyscraper

They are not wrong there - it is BUT
Take DIE HARD being a softer version of this
You have a amputee (very well played by Johnson) whose family is trapped in a yet to be opened residential section of the worlds tallest building and some terrorists who want to retrieve the original data copy of three Mafia organizations exposing their criminal activities
And to that them setting fire to the building in an attempt to ether get the disk or destroy it and no possibility of the fire being put out by conventional means and you have a heart racing drama fitting to both compared movies
In Die Hard there was no real firework in the but to Maintain the drama
Criminals take over the building in an attempt to steal stocks and bonds
In the Towering Inferno there was a urgent rush to save the people and put the fire out
Bigger rush
In Skyscraper although there are fewer people involved there is a very high Adrenalin rush when Dwayne has to save his family not only from the engulfing fire but from the criminals as well
All doing it as an amputee
All three movies were good but I would rate them as
Skyscraper 1
Towering Inferno 2
Die Hard 3
All rated in adrenaline rush sequence
I enjoyed each movie for their story line and visual affects
The acting was fair in all three cases
The CGI graphics in Skyscraper were a little over the top compared to the other two movies
And could have been toned down by at least 50 to 75 %
The visual affects of the building though was very good

The plot of this movie is so lame and it's just an excuse for Dwayne to come to the rescue. This idea had so much potential, they spent a butt load of money on special effects, wish they would have spent less on special effects and more on hiring better actors and writers. I want to move to Hollywood, get a job writing crap and make lots of money. I don't understand who keeps financing these crap movies?The other thing that really annoys me is the movie is shot almost entirely in the dark. Hollywood has forgotten how to light night scenes. I'm sick of squinting and trying to figure out what they're doing, put some damn light on the action already.Rawson Marshal Thurber director/producer, why? He's made some lame semi comedic movies, who thought it would be a good idea for this dude to be in charge of an action movie? It kind of explains why the plot and dialogue are so terrible, his movies aren't known for plot or dialogue, he basically relied on stupid base jokes. The whole thing is just sad. Thankfully this painful movie is only 102 minutes long although it feels like the pain is never going to end. If you're a fan of The Rock and have to see all his movies, wait 2 months and it will be on HBO and Netflix save the $15.",Skyscraper

Even the non-stop special effects couldn't save this film from being completely dull and forgettable. The desired green-screen work was sub-par which caused the illusion of the effect to be lost to the knowledge that ""yup, this is a green-screen shot."" Cliched to the point of absurdity with a formulaic plot complete with the opening scene of personal loss both emotional and relayed in physical form - cheap. The story-line was so poorly created that upon review I am pretty sure that the criminal element of this film actually spent more on the heist then they could have reaped from the purported ""treasure."" Combine these lapses in production oversight with a architectural plan of a building mysteriously designed with no redundancies or fail-safes outside of that controlled remotely by a couple underpaid lackeys who wouldn't have been hired to guard a Slurpee Machine in Delouth, and you have the makings of a seriously over-budgeted, under-edited, poorly directed and visually painful film.Avoid the viewing.

""Skyscraper"" is definitely not smart, but it doesn't create suspension of disbelief, either.It's okay to take certain licenses in order to create excitement, but this much dumbness is an insult to the audience's intellect. Look, you can't stand 20 feet above a 150 foot bonfire and not become a pot roast. You simply can't. And because ""Skyscraper"" is a survival adventure, this haphazard attitude towards the laws of physics makes the whole point of surviving moot.""Skyscraper"" is so childish and so clichéd and so unimaginative, that in the end it's not that much fun, although it is fast-paced (at least). It's seriously lacking in humour. The best moments are those with Dwayne Johnson alone in the heights battling against the towering inferno trying to kill him. But even those scenes are inexplicably interrupted by cringeworthy shots of an audience following his exploits via media screens. A really bad call.Happily, though, ""Skyscraper"" is also racist. It's a Chinese-American co-production taking place in Hong Kong, and every single European character is evil. In fact, Neve Campbell - as The Wife - is the only good caucasian. All Chinese characters are good, except for one psychopatic, female killing machine, who is supposed to be ""bad-ass"" and ""kinda cool"".Two things - in addition to those Dwayne Johnson scenes mentioned - save this from a one-star-rating: Neve Campbell and the cinematography by Robert Elswit.""Skyscaper"" won't burn into your brain.

It's not a new concept by any stretch of the imagination, but the writers manage to find ways to keep it fun and enjoyable. Most refreshing is the fact that Sawyer's family isn't completely inept; he's not entirely saving them so much as he's helping them save themselves. If you're a Dwayne Johnson fan, he doesn't disappoint in the slightest either, especially with the ways his character displays his obvious love of duct tape. Unfortunately, some of the characters (villains, especially) aren't elaborated on or fleshed out in the slightest, so you don't really understand why they're even there. I also wish we could've seen more than three or four areas of what was essentially a vertical city. I feel the movie could have done with being a little longer, but it's honestly not bad as it is.

287,GoldenBlunderbuss,An adequate big budget summer blockbuster,6,25 July 2018,"Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson battles bad guys, towering infernos and the very laws of nature and physics as he tries not to die hard 200+ floors in the air.
 Despite the criticisms people have levelled against it, Skyscraper knows full well what films it's stealing from; one man against an army in a tall building from Die Hard, the infallible structure caught in a raging fire from Towering Inferno, and deceptive digital environments straight from the final act of Total Recall. Only Dwayne Johnson can get away with a film so brazenly ridiculous and telepathically predictable but still make it a surprisingly heartfelt series of set-pieces to sit through (it's under two hours, which is a miracle these days).Although the premise and perils have been done multiple times before, the script deserves credit for giving the female lead (Neve Campbell) something to actually do besides be the one needing rescuing by the hunky action star. Instead, as the mother of the on-screen family, she takes on her own battles against the flames and ever-spawning bad guys to keep her kids safe while Johnson battles to be reunited and help them escape. Granted, by the final act, it's the hunky action star that must save the day and defeat the bad guys once while his wife looks on helplessly ... except she doesn't as she works with the police to get the fire systems back under control. Special note has to be made to the ridiculous situations the characters find themselves in. On more than one occasion, either Johnson or Campbell (or both) mutter ""This is nuts/ crazy/ stupid!"" and it's hard to disagree when the plan is to abseil down the face of a building using nothing but a length of nylon rope tied to a light fitting. An urgent note to all filmmakers before this plot-hole polyfiller is used any further: just because your characters reference that something is dumb, lazy or against ethical ideals doesn't make having such things in your script acceptable.When all is said and done, Skyscraper will likely be forgotten with the rest of Johnson's summer blockbusters within 12 months (anyone still talk about Central Intelligence, San Andreas or Hercules?). That's not to say you won't enjoy it, but take it with the pinch of salt and try not to think you could be watching Die Hard instead.Best Quote: ""If you can't fix it with duct tape ... you ain't using enough duct tape!""",Skyscraper

It's even harder to come across a big budget action film that's not based on a superhero trying to save the world. Somehow, Dwayne Johnson got his hands on a big budget action movie that isn't a superhero movie, but at the same time, doesn't feel all that fresh either.Dwayne Johnson plays Will Sawyer, a security supervisor that is commissioned to over see an over 200 story residential and shopping tower entitled ""The Pearl"". After expressing concerns over security flaws in the tower, it almost immediately goes under attack by some terrorists in search of the owner of the building. In the middle of it all, Will has to break back into the building to save his family.I do appreciate the films ambition to call back to 90s style action thriller in terms of pacing. It's almost always moving, but I never really felt on the edge of my seat as much as the film wants me to be. It's mostly because the severely rushed first act doesn't give you time to care for the characters or set pieces don't get enough time to crank up the tension.Also, my biggest issue with the movie is for a building that boasts how it's over 200 stories high, I never really feel the height of the building. We spend most of the films time in maybe 8 or 9 stories of the building and it could have been written as a super advanced 80 story building and been the exact same movie.Skyscraper is never a badly made movie, but not enough to leave a strong impression either. While I give it credit for having more action on the go, I found myself questioning a lot of decisions the characters make. I just wished the films ambitions were as high as the building it takes place in.Rating: 5.6 / 10",Skyscraper

There are also a few other items that can make you a little nuts if you know a little about chemistry and how the human body works.

Problem, humans can't breath CO2. The amount needed to put out the fire would also kill everyone in there as well.Considering all that, this film is still worth to watch.

I really do, in every interview he gives he seems like a stand up guy and after seeing Rampage I understand he will say yes to any project. Still, Skyscraper looks and feels like a 3rd tier straight to video family friendly action movie. It is less a homage to The Towering Inferno, which, by the way, is a more exciting film and features a pre-murdery O.J. Simpson, and more just a cobbling together collection of set pieces from Mission Impossible, Die Hard and others. Skyscraper is also a very safe film the knows it's place. The violence and language are kept PG and the fight scenes are bloodless and sparse at best. In fact, most of the 'thrills' come from watching the Rock dangle off the side of a building over and over and over again... The story? The largest building in the world is on fire and the Rock must rescue his family. Guess what happens. The Towering Inferno was about corporate greed and technology outpacing our ability to keep people safe. Skyscraper settles for terrorists and the love of family (yawn). There are also several scenes that give miscellaneous Chinese supporting players the opportunity to shoot people and watch video monitors. Again, yawn. Any film lives or dies based on how much the audience cares about the characters in it and action films are no exception. Skyscraper is populated with terrorists who execute a needlessly elaborate and complicated plan, police who jump to stupid conclusions and the Hong Kong fire service who deal with structure fires by not showing up. Seriously, not ONE fire engine in the entire movie. As I said, I like the Rock and I wish him nothing but success but if he continues to waste his start power on garbage like Rampage and Skyscraper he will end up reduced to co-staring with Nicolas Cage in the next Ghost Rider sequel.

304,darryl-42069,Die Hard 2018... kinda,7,14 July 2018,"Die Hard movies are pretty influential for the action genre, that it spawned numerous movies inspired by it. I loved all four Die Hard movies (nope, never gonna admit the fifth one exists), and I enjoyed Die Hard inspired movies like Olympus Has Fallen, White House Down, etc. So when I found out that Skyscraper is literally 2018's Die Hard, I quickly became interested with the movie. And in some ways it does satisfy my desire of a new Die Hard movie. But if only they add more action, more humor and have a more compelling villain, it would be a much better movie.Pros:
CastDwayne Johnson continues to prove that he's one of the most bankable, likable actor in Hollywood right now. His performance as Will Sawyer is great. He's likable, he's relatable, and he's a good character overall. Neve Campbell is great as Will's wife Sarah. I also liked how she's not your typical damsel-in-distress female character, in fact she kicks alot of a**! Chin Han is also great as Zhao. Lastly, Roland Møller did a good job as Kores.ActionThe action, while it does look unrealistic and stupid at times, actually is great. All of the action scenes were shot and edited brilliantly. One of the action scene is a clear reference to/inspired by the Burj Khalifa scene in Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol, and I love it. Another one might reference the final fight in John Wick 2, which in turn references the fight in Enter the Dragon. While not as mind-blowing, it's still a sight to behold.MusicSteve Jablonsky is always a win, nuff said. I mean sure you could hate the Transformers franchise, but one thing that they done right was the music by Steve Jablonsky, and this is yet another great music from him.TensionThis movie is actually intense at times, which I appreciate. Sure, not as pulse-pounding like Die Hard, but much appreciated nonetheless.
Cons:
Surface level writingPlot-wise: yup, it's Die Hard 2018, just without Bruce Willis in it (kinda wish he made a cameo on this on). In terms of writing, however, it's clear that it has none of the clever writing compared to Die Hard. The villain is forgettable and one-dimensional, the story is exposition heavy, there's no clear backstory of the villains, and I think they blew all of their budget on the 1st act, that they made the ending very anticlimactic to me.Too shortIt's way too short! The movie has a runtime of around 1 and a half hours, which is disappointing. A movie like this should be 2+ hours long, allowing more character development, more action scenes and etc. It can be longer. It *should* be longer.Should be R ratedTo be honest, and this is probably a nitpick, but honestly, if the movie is R rated, the movie would have been much better. More cuss words, more yippie-ki-yay moments, more blood, etc. Just add a bit of these, and the movie would probably be better.Overall, you'll have a good time with this movie. While it does satisfy the crave for a new Die Hard movie, if the movie dared to go all in R rated, with longer runtime and more blood and cuss, I think It'll help the movie more.

Long drawn out fights with lots of kicks and knocking weapons out of hands, only for the good guy to always prevail. Yadda, yadda, yadda. Yawn.

I rented it on Redbox for a dollar and was/am over it about 40 min in and started looking at things on my phone. Like IMBD to write this review. Speaking of The Rock Climbs Things and Rescues His Family, he has now teamed up with the Rich Asian to save his daughter ""daddy!"" On the top of the edge of the building. What will happen??? Do you think the daughter will die??? Will The Rock survive?? Will all the bad guys get what they came for and get away with it??? Boy. I. Don't.

So many plot holes and cliches!
Bad guy is 'european', another bad guy is posh english, wears tweed and waistcoat, resembles a rat and gets beat up by a woman (yawn!)Another is a skinny asian chick, with a pout and a very dodgy hairdo, who easily takes down numerous grown men, yawn!
Of course, the 'mother' fights her in the end, predictable!
All bullets miss, even when the target has disappeared, the bad guys are still hitting walls and doorways.
If you're climbing a building and are 1500ft up, how exactly do the media cams get 'parellel' shots from the ground?
Oh, why didn't this building crumble to dust at freefall speed?
The scene when the mother and child drop in the elevator is meant to be 5 secs, but is around 14 seconds long, she would have hit the ground a long time ago and died!When the Rock is watching the firedoors close near the end and is trying to untie is prosthetic leg, the firedoors take an absolute eternity to close, and of course, he makes it!
The two children don't remotely look like the product of a caucasian woman and a hawaiian/pacific island man, they are too dark and have afro hair!
Come on man!
At the end, when 'Sawyer' is crying and calling out to his wife amongst the crowds of people (think 'Die hard') 10000 of whom have all gathered into a 50 by 50 ft space for some reason, he has no need to panic, as he had already watched them on the news, emerge safe and well from their 5-14 second elevator drop!Throughout, the kids are all 'mommeeee/daddeee', the lad has a mystery cough throughout, very forced, that is supposed to be asthma?
In the end, its unclear what the bad guys wanted.

No character development.Really? What character development? That's not the point. You want character development? Watch 12 Angry men. This one is pure fun and action. And even though I agree that it does not quite get to the Towering Inferno or Die Hard level, it's fun nevertheless. Just don't start with physics and logic. It's much more watchable than Tom Cruise flying into the exact right room heaven only knows how many storeys away in one of the MIs.

But, this is the 1st movie of his that i didnt like (Even the ones that didnt do too well at boxoffice) ..... Nothing there to enjoy....unnecessary drama and somewhat ridiculous stunts....
The story has no connectivity and the final scene is a rip off of a Bruce Lee movie (Not giving the name as it will be a spoiler) ... only the scene made more sense in the Bruce Lee movie as there were no automatic guns involved back then (only swords/katanas)
The one legged Rock climb (Crane) was when the movie started making zero sense and slowly became much worse. 
And, Damnnnnn!!! The Drama ..too much senseless drama was simply too hard to swallow.

The plot is bare bones and there are oh so many plot holes--there is so much that the characters do that makes ZERO sense. They should've hired someone to improve that and the dialogue. There were some interesting elements that would have benefited from a better screenplay--we barely hear anything about or see Neve Campbell's character but what little we learn is intriguing. The Rock's character is interesting, too, shame they didn't give him some decent lines/more to work with.

The movie basically starts after the first thirty minutes, until then it is kina boring, but still watchable, it is just fine. After that the movie finally fully starts and if i am being honest, it is fun, i enjoyed it, it went by pretty fast, but when i think back about thit, it didn't really give me that much action. There is one, maybe two really big and loud action blockbuster moments, but other than that, the action is bland and not very good. The climbing scenes are very good, those i enjoyed, because i was prett much fully immersed and they were compelling, but basically everythin inside the skyscraper was pretty boring, cliched and not very well shot. Sure, the movie looks pretty, but that is all you get inside the skyscraper, it is a whole different story outside.
Now the performances, The Rock plays himself and i do not mind that at all. The mas is great, he is likeable, he has a huge charisma and it works. He surprised me, because there actually is some acting from his part and i thought he is pretty good in this movie. I really liked Neve, because she is also very likeable and she is very beautiful. As for the villains, they are ver generic and pretty boring.
When you are watching the movie, you maybe have fun, it is entertaining at some moments, but when you walk out of the theatre, you don't really remember anything that happened in this movie, because it is simply not that memorable. You watch it, you enjoy it and then you just move on to some better blockbuster.

359,letande,100% Old School.,8,12 July 2018,"I was born in early 80s, so, you can say that I grew up with this kind of movies. Late 80s and early 90s were all about them. Strong men kicking the bad guys' butts while surviving the impossible situations. Very often that formula also included families. Die Hard, Commando... you know the stuff. Unfortunately, even though we still have a lot of action movies around, this exact kind of them somehow became obsolete. Those big muscular guys just aren't that popular anymore. People want Benedict Cumberbatch, not Arnold Schwarzenegger, while kids want to be like Iron Man, not like Rambo. Well, different heroes for different times, I guess, but still, I missed the old school way. The strong family guy saving his family from the bad guys... there's just nothing like it. And guess what? That's exactly what this movie is.And I'm not even surprised that it was produced by Dwayne Johnson and has him playing the leading role. There's something old school about the good ol' Rock and I always felt like he's keeping the old school spirit alive on the big screen. And now he did just that - his own version of Die Hard. With baddies, family in trouble and muscular guy to save the day. I can't even add anything to it. It's just that - an old school action movie. Lack of originality? Sure, can't argue with that. There's nothing original here. Well, the skyscraper itself looks great, the movie feels really exciting in modern 3D and sure, Dwayne Johnson's character has only one leg, which works as a nice modern touch and will make this movie even better for certain kind of viewers, since it can really give them a lot of inspiration, but aside from that there's nothing really new here. You saw Die Hard, you can say that you've seen this movie too. But let's not forget two things. First of all, we live in times when they just don't make this kind of movies anymore. And second - such movies don't even need to be original. They need to be exciting and inspiring. And Skyscraper have all of it. It's very enjoyable and can give you and your family a lot of good mood. Which means that it did its work perfectly. Maybe it's not one of those ""must see"" movies, but if you missed this kind of movies as much as I did, I'd say don't miss it.

So here is 7 standard templates are typical for this kind of movie: 1) group of terrorists from Europe with charismatic leader (ok, in this film main villain has lack of charisma); 2) ""bad-ass bad girl"" also right hand of antagonist; 3) old friend who betray protagonist and you know it after watching on him for 3-4 minutes; 4) main hero-dad who wants only peace after bad experience on previous job, but always ready to beat trash out of bad guys; 5) members of protagonist family, who were taken as a hostages (children's, wife); 6) girls fight at the end; 7) some small McGuffin at the begin which will play important (key !) role at the end of movie. Yes accent in movie was also focused on physical disability of main hero this fact increase empathy to him. But overall, Skyscraper its a combination of different movies. Not need to go far, you may spot similarity with ""Die hard"" series and ""MI: Ghost protocol"". Maybe this is why Skyscraper was release almost at the same date when ""Die hard 1"" was released 30 years ago. For audience this movie is nice way to spend 2 hours of their life, eat some popcorn and watch ""salad"" of action movies with main Action star of last years in main role.",Skyscraper

The movie inludes a lot of CGI which i think does not help much, and the prosthetic leg is kinda not needed as a gimmick for this type of action.Various elements of the Rock's other films like:
*A huge building being destroyed but without Rampage's Gorilla.
*The Rock working as a rescue man in mid destruction like San Andreas.
*The Rock deilvering a nasty Spear because he had uses Rock Bottom and Spinebuster in previous films and... you can't justify a People's Elbow.
*The Rock jumping a big gap but without cars between bridges. Well this was Vin Diesel, but same franchise.✍ Overall is your run of the mill blockbuster with pure action and little depth that it's an easy watch and enjoyable enough with decent badass characters in The Rock and Neve Campbell and generic villains.

386,brennandube,Another add to the Dwayne Johnson mediocre action film list.,6,19 July 2018,"'Skyscraper' is directed and written by Rawson Marshall Thurber ('Central Intelligence', 'We're the Millers'). The film follows Johnson, who plays an FBI Agent and U.S army vet, and his family. Johnson's character, 'Will Sawyer' is sent to examine the safety of a new tower being built in Hong Kong. Upon his travels, shenanigans ensue and he must save the day. 'Skyscraper' offered a very simple story line that was covered with predictable twists and clichéd villains. Despite these very clear structures within the film, 'Skyscraper' was actually a solid popcorn flick. I enjoyed the movie mainly due to the well inserted intensity and some very solid action sequences. The dynamic of having the film be centered around a skyscraper seemed very silly in the trailers and TV spots but upon watching this film I can attest to it actually making for some cool scenes. I did end up seeing this film in 3D due to the great things I heard about how it looked. I was not disappointed and the 3D definitely enhanced my experience and enjoyment in 'Skyscraper.' That being said, 3D is not a necessity for this movie and it can still be watched and enjoyed in standard 2D.'Skyscraper' has a plot that is simple enough to follow but not enough to really feel a connection with the film at all. There were times in this movie where certain dialogue was used that was absolutely unnecessary and cheesy, definitely one of the years weakest scripts. At times certain lines even took me out of the movie. One positive thing about 'Skyscraper' I can confidently say is that it did not go out of its way to throw silly jokes in. This is something that other summer blockbusters always go for and it can often feel very misplaced. As previously stated, Johnson rocks in the action scenes and director Rawson Marshall Thurber did a great job at constructing some very entertaining sequences. At times I felt I had to just turn my brain off and not question some rather convenient moments but that being said I was not taken out of the action sequences all that much. The special effects were great in this movie and some of the rooms in the skyscraper look so damn cool. Dwayne Johnson delivers a very Dwayne Johnson performance in this movie and his charisma and charm in the lead role continues to be a draw. Not much of the supporting cast did much to enhance this film but the family rescue scenario worked out pretty well. Neve Campbell is in this film and she does a swell job at portraying the mother in the family, she even does a solid job during the action scenes as well. Most of the cast does a good job especially working with the dialogue they had. The score definitely could have been better, thinking back in this film I don't even recall hearing music at all. It's important that a score leaves its touch and enhances intensity but Steve Jablonsky's score in this film did not do that.",Skyscraper

My expectations were low to begin with, but the predictability was off the charts. Way too many last second saves where Dwayne Johnson escapes death. Okay, that may be acceptable to most, but my intelligence was totally insulted when they used the fire suppression system to remove the air from the fire with DJ and his kid in the same room.

 In other words, something new goes live (ship, building, technology, etc. that's astronomically expensive but is designed to benefit mankind which justifies its cost) and a scorned individual (or group) has a nefarious plot to bring it all down or exploit it to threaten mankind, usually because he/she/they were betrayed at some point or the classic case of the inventor being shunned from his own creation. I feel like the copious amounts of wall panel terminal CGI and gratuitous scary height shots are compensating for the lackluster plot (we get it; they're really really really high off the ground). Unfortunately CGI and grand visuals are staples in modern movies so if they are trying to emulate a Roland Emmerich flick (e.g. ID4 and 2012), we've seen it before...a lot.I love The Rock but it's difficult to take him seriously considering he gets stabbed on the left shoulder by rogue debris, he pulls it out & patches himself up, then proceeds to pull himself up through the many instances when he's hanging on for dear life.

403,Gpanther67,"Put this with some of Johnson's duds, a dissapointment",4,17 August 2018,"Dwayne Johnson's road from WWE wrestling superstar to Hollywood's highest paid male film star has not been easy and his film success has been like a roller coaster with many ups and downs. His films have been box office successes like ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" & ""The Fate of the Furious"" but he has also had some very painful flops like ""Baywatch"" & ""Hercules"". The truth is even while he is been in high demand and incredibly busy the last few years, his films aren't always stellar, but Johnson is without a doubt one of the most capable action / blockbuster stars working today. 2018 has been a good year for Johnson, with his previous two films doing solid business. His third film might be his most ambitious and his fans are hoping it will be one of his best. Johnson plays Will Sawyer a former soldier and FBI Hostage Rescue Team leader who was badly injured during a hostage mission, losing his leg. After marrying the woman who performed the surgery that saved him and having twins, he is now a family man that is trying to start his own business assessing the safety and security for skyscrapers. A former FBI team member of his has set him up for his most important job yet; inspecting & consulting for ""The Pearl"", the world's tallest skyscraper in Hong Kong. During his meeting with its billionaire owner, Zhao Long Ji, Sawyer is given a tablet that has access to the building's security and safety systems. The tablet is valuable to a group of international terrorists who have already extorted Zhao once, but now has the money laundering tracking information on its leader, Kores Botha in the form of a memory card. Botha wants the card and will do anything for it. The terrorist get the tablet from Sawyer and use it to set the building on fire with Zhao in his penthouse and Sawyer's family right above the fire. Sawyer returns to the building to save his family and battle the bad guys. Inevitably, anyone who watches this film will compare it to ""The Towing Inferno"" and ""Die Hard"", which are both far more superior to ""Skyscraper"". The film simply has too many flaws, glaring plot holes and a complete lack of humor, which is a good ingredient for any blockbuster popcorn film. It's the later complaint that really troubled me the most since it made the film seem less fun and watchable. It really would have helped if the writers had put some humor into the film instead of just relying on the action sequences. Speaking of those, the film does have many but they are mostly of Johnson having to perform a death defying stunt to get to his family. Most employ him barely catching a ledge or making an unbelievable jump, despite only having one leg. I don't mind these kinds of scenes but ""Skyscraper"" really seems to push them on its audience, they are exciting but they remind us we are watching a movie, where these stunts only succeed. One of the hardest to believe has him climbing a huge crane in mere minutes and then jumping off of it. This superhuman act was way too incredible to believe. One other huge advantage that ""Die Hard"" has over ""Skyscraper"" is a very good bad guy, the villain in this film is a bore. No charisma or appeal whatsoever. Even the building, which is probably very cool, gets pushed aside without much fanfare. In the preview we got the sense that the sheer size would play into the film, but I really didn't get that sense very often. One thing I did appreciate was that they didn't waste the role of the building's owner. Most films would have had him killed early or even stupidly made him the secret villain, this film made him smart, good and important to the story; something refreshing in most popcorn films. The one thing I hated the most was the ending that was ripped from ""Enter the Dragon"", if you are a fan of the film and see this you'll know what I mean. Overall, I would say that ""Skyscraper"" is an exciting film, but one with serious flaws and a real lack of what makes popcorn films much more entertaining. They had one of the best popcorn action stars at their disposal but dropped the ball and failed to use him like they should have. I went in with high hopes but walked out thinking the film should have been much more or in the least I have seen a better version of the film.",Skyscraper
404,abryan,Just such a stupid movie.,2,27 September 2018,"I've said many times before, that I'm a movie fan not a movie critic. But when I see a bad movie, I know it, and this is a bad movie. I can forgive a movie for being unoriginal, or having a stupid plot, as long as it makes up for it in other areas, such as action, special effects, pacing etc. But this one just took the piss. My main issue with this movie are:1) It is hideously predictable. You can see stuff being setup that you know are going to feature later in the movie. EG. That stupid sky dome thing with the hundreds of screens in there. What the hell. I know exactly how that would be used toward the end of the movie. These setups were laughable.2) Everybody in the movie, except the Americans (except his ex-cop buddy) and the Chinese are baddies. Which makes me think this movie was nothing more than a cash grab for the US and Chinese markets. Hence the reason there seems to be a lot of money chucked at it, and no thought about the actual story.3) Stereotypes. Once again, Hollywood has to resort to stereotypes. For example, Noah Taylor, who is a very good actor. In this movie, not only is he British, but he is uber British, with an almost Dick Van Dike Merry Poppins accent. Really...!?!?!?!??! And God know where the lead baddies was meant to be from? I know Roland Møller, is from Denmark and they do say he is Scandinavian in the movie. But his accent seemed to be part Middle Eastern, part South African, Part God knows what..!!!
 
Bottom line is this film is just not very good. Special Effects are ok I guess. But the action set pieces are stilted, predictable and over done. The acting is meh. And I'm starting to have my doubts about Dwayne Johnson being a leading man. Think he might need to choose his future projects a bit more carefully.My recommendation with this movie, don't bother.

But, Skyscraper does not reach its peak performance where even the mighty Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson cannot even overcome this obstacle.Set in Hong Kong, the opening of the world's tallest building - The Pearl. Said to be 50 stories taller than the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, UAE... yet, the movie had it coming in several hundred feet shorter than the Burj in reality. Just one of many loop holes. Don't worry, in a few year, The Jeddah Tower (Jeddah, Saudi Arabia) and the KL118 (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia) each will pass the Burj and the fictional Pearl in height. Is there a coincidence, this is now 30 years after tragedy of Nakamori Tower in Los Angeles? Though Skyscraper was not set on Christmas Eve. And instead of being barefoot, The Rock is missing a foot. Errrr, leg. Security consultant, Will Sawyer (Johnson), is hired as an independent third party consultant to test the fire safety throughout the top half of the skyscraper. Once approved, The Pearl can open for full-time business. Security consultant testing fire safety. Yep. After an opening scene set up to how Will Sawyer lost his leg, the movie almost immediately turns predictable even in trivial conversations to fully introduce the lead couple. Add into that major plot holes on both sides of the true bad guys and the creator of The Pearl, Skyscraper confuses the audience just exactly which people will fully turn against Sawyer.Luckily the action is real and it becomes easier to figure out which sub-characters are the true bad guys. The movie steals plot ideas from other obvious actions films like Die Hard, as mentioned above. What few speaking roles each of the characters had lacked originality or non-cheesinesses. Until this movie, only MacGyver loved duck tape this much. Now, so does Will Sawyer. To prove this, he turns his role of duct tape inside out on his hands to Mission: Impossible The Pearl. Once again, a direct steal since Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) did it on The Burj with high technologically developed equipment; which gave it a sense of believe.The movie turns more into a rescue mission than a Die Hard hostage situation, though they could not help themselves but revisit their opening two scenes at the climax of the film. Predictably. There is so much more to criticize on every aspect of the film, from the asthmatic son coughing non-stop only to magically breathe fine in order to say his one line, then return immediately to coughing; to the predictable fight scene involving Neve Campbell; to the crowd cheering on Sawyer as he advances throughout the burning building.The reason why so many sequels are released is because so many movies lack developed* scripts.

415,fredlondi,"*SPOILERS* The ""Turn Around""-ing Inferno",6,18 July 2018,"In the lead-up to the release of ""Skyscraper,"" Dwayne Johnson mentioned ""The Towering Inferno"" (1974) as a source of the film's inspiration. This made me interested in the film since the story of ""Inferno"" was itself an interesting story.""Inferno"" combined the efforts of both Warner Brothers and 20th Century Fox, and was headlined by screen legends Paul Newman and Steve McQueen. This effort was the result of a bidding war for two different, but similar novels about a fire in a fictional skyscraper: ""The Tower"" by Richard Martin Stern and ""The Glass Inferno"" by Thomas N. Scortia and Frank M. Robinson.Having read these two books earlier this year, I was surprised to find a disproportionate amount of material was taken from ""Inferno"" as opposed to ""Tower."" Perhaps this was because Allen lost the bid for ""Tower"" to Warner Brothers, and grabbed-up the rights to ""Inferno"" when it was only an outline. ""Inferno"" tells the story of the National Curtainwall Building, also known as ""The Glass House,"" a 66-story building that explodes into flames because a drunken janitor carelessly tossed his lit cigarette into a storage room. Iconic moments from the film like the scenic elevator sequence, another elevator stopping on the fire floor, and the blowing of the rooftop water tanks are in this book. So are several of its characters and their interactions, including security man Harry Jernigan (played by O.J. Simpson), widow Lisolette Mueller (Jennifer Jones), con man Harlee Claiborne (Fred Astaire), white-collar Dan Bigelow (Robert Wagner), and firefighter Mario Infantino (who was renamed Fire Chief O'Hallorhan, McQueen's character in the film). There are also no less than ten other characters with subplots that would also have made great additions to the movie, plus several ""teasers"" that trick you into thinking this is the moment the fire starts before it finally does. In short, this book truly feels like the film.""Tower,"" on the other hand, was used sparingly, salting ""Inferno"" with compatible plot points and moments. It's from this book, for example, that the building's height is made much taller, referring to a 125-story World Tower in New York. From this book, we get architect Will Giddings, who was renamed Doug Roberts in the film as Paul Newman's character (interestingly, the film has its own Will Giddings, who is the first to be burned in the fire). The film's subplot about changes made to the building's plans by Simmons (played by Richard Chaimberlain in the film) takes a much greater role in the book - perhaps too much of one, distracting from the fire and those trapped on the top floor. It's also from this book that the film got its breeches buoy sequence, complete with a harpoon shot from a helicopter and affixed to another building (one of the World Trade Center towers, no less). It also has the film's sequence of a character's panicked attempt to run down the stairs being thwarted by the flames.This comparison between the two books was in the back of my mind while watching ""Skyscraper."" I realized, much to my surprise, the opposite of ""The Towering Inferno."" The writers appeared to have picked up some of the unused portions of Stern's ""The Tower"" from 1974 and updated them into a modern film.In ""Skyscraper,"" terrorists break into the sub-basement of the building and spread flammable dust on a floor that ignites with water, all the while shutting off the building's fire suppression systems. In ""Tower,"" a disgruntled employee walks into the sub-basement of the World Tower with a bomb, rigs it to the electrical system, and the resulting blast fries the wiring and starts the fire.Both buildings in ""Skyscraper"" and ""Tower"" aren't described very well, or for very long, and somehow feel much smaller than they really are. They're also merely settings instead of characters, as they were in ""Inferno"" the book and ""The Towering Inferno."" Yes, we see plans and the overall design of The Pearl in this film, but we never get a sense of what it's like to explore the building, much less live in there (no thanks to a one-line fix where the residential floors ""aren't open yet""). This prevents both buildings from feeling as impressive or large as they could be, which is a shame given some of the neat visuals used in the film.In ""Skyscraper,"" the fire department plays a surprisingly nonexistent role as the fire burns out of control several stories above them, and we never see any of their efforts to actually put it out. Instead, Dwayne Johnson's character has to find his way in and try and rescue his family. In ""Tower,"" there's also very little seen of firefighters (other than a pair climbing to the roof, only to become stranded), and the story ends up revolving around the architect and his assistant as they try and figure out a way to evacuate the top floor.""Skyscraper"" also very nearly copies the bleak ending of ""Tower,"" where the breeches buoy fails and the heat and smoke kill off the remaining survivors on the top floor. There's no rooftop water supply to save our heroes, and flames have completely surrounded them. Only a last-minute poke on a tablet saves our survivors from the same fate.I found these and other comparisons to ""Tower"" interesting, but also at times distracting. The modern film conventions of gun battles, ridiculous feats of strength by Johnson, and precocious children really stood out to me. This is very much an action movie bolted onto ""The Tower,"" and there's a collision of entirely too many things going on as a result. While I appreciated the film's length of less than two hours - something even ""The Towering Inferno"" couldn't accomplish - it's the result of some choppy and fast editing that sometimes gets overwhelming and shatters any attempt at investment. I also found the opening sequence where we learn about how Johnson's character lost his leg to be excessive as a subsequent sequence on a boat gives this exposition more artfully. Johnson's fake leg seems to be an effort to make him more of an everyman like those in ""Towering Inferno,"" which I appreciated - but by still having him be special forces, etc., he's unfortunately typecast into being a borderline superhero, complete with a gawking crowd watching his antics on TV and on their phones. I found his role in ""San Andreas"" to be much more human as he didn't so readily have all the answers and played a more believable and relatable character.Is this a flawed film? Yes, and all disaster films are, including ""The Towering Inferno."" Take a shot every time someone says ""turn around' and you won't make it to the end. Is it a bad film? Yes, but only by comparison. And that's perhaps its most significant comparison to ""The Tower."" It has some of the right parts and hits some of the right notes, but in the end, it's sadly inferior to another source that did the same thing much better with a much simpler story.",Skyscraper

It's a great classic action movie and I never tire of seeing it. The comparisons of Skyscraper to Die Hard made it a *must see* for me on its opening weekend. I wasn't expecting high art, but I was expecting what D.H. delivered: smart, witty dialogue and an interesting and engaging story involving characters about which I cared and who were portrayed by gifted actors. Plus action. Lots of action. Skyscraper only delivered on the action part. Nothing else. The dialogue was flat, uninspired and artless; the story ambled along with insufficient interest and suspense to really engage me; and none of the characters felt truly authentic or appealing (as good or bad guys). I like the Rock, but he doesn't have Willis's bad-ass cowboy snark, which really made D.H. fun to watch. That was probably at least partly due to Skyscraper's weak script. And importantly, there was no villain in Skyscraper to match the late, great Alan Rickman's Hans. Skyscraper's acting was ho-hum all the way around, which suggests to me that, in addition to being poorly written, it was miscast. My 4 stars are due to some pretty interesting visuals and special effects. But IMHO, they're not enough to justify paying $15+ for this movie.

Johnson has openly stated he made this movie in homage to the good old-fashioned action movies of Bruce Willis, Schwarzenegger, etc. This movie delivers. This is better than nearly all of the Die Hard sequels. The bad guys are played by very capable, talented actors. The cinematography and visuals are awesome. The kids seem like normal kids and are not annoying for a change.

And it was so terrible that I had to write this review. There is no defense for movies that are terrible because it means that other better movies don't get funded and don't get made because shit movies like this gets made by hack writers and hack directors, just like this Marshall Thurber. At least Central Intelligence had humor and a somewhat original plot. This terrible rip-off of Die Hard has none of the suspense and tension that made Die Hard such a thrilling movie. It's ridiculous to write a character with a leg handicap in this movie and yet never factor this important thing into the actual story in a realistic way. There are absolutely no real stakes in this movie. You never doubt that the Rock or his family will survive this whole ordeal. There is never a doubt and therefore never a feeling of suspense. It's one gigantic orgy of computer generated CGI-effects for 80% of the movie. It feels fake because it IS fake. There is never a sense of danger, a sense of threat, a sense of suspense, a sense of tension. NO, it's just a bloody waste of time just watching Johnson's character go from point to point, doing CGI stunt to stunt, never actually risking life or limb. In the movie, his character climbs the crane that is next to the skyscraper and we are to believe that it is the tallest tower in the world... just think about that! A character with a leg handicap climbs a crane that is so tall in less than 15 minutes! WTF?!?! Like, seriously... WTF?!! As charming as Dwayne Johnson is as a person and actor, he is no Tom Cruise. If you watch any of the Mission Impossible films, you know it's Tom Cruise risking his life. Watch Mission Impossible 4, and you know that Tom Cruise is hanging off from the highest building in Dubai. Now, that's a real life skyscraper that was used, and Tom Cruise was hanging off of that. 
That scene had more tension than this whole entire movie! You are better off watching that film or the original Die Hard, both of which had better plot-twists and strong characters where the action is felt because it involved real characters with real-world stakes. This trash is so fake that it doesn't even raise the pulse when you are watching whatever happen on screen because mentally you know it's completely computer graphics imagery (CGI). I have decided I will only watch Dwayne Johnson in movies where he is a supporting character, meaning that he has a team or he is paired with someone else. Watching him as the main character is a waste of time because you never feel the threat to his character. If it's a comedy film, it's fine. But for an action movie, this becomes tedious and boring to sit through because it's no different than watching Transformers or Pacific Rim where it's all CGI action. Yawn. Jumanji was great because there were other characters, besides the Rock, and the same goes for the Fast and Furious franchise. When the Rock is with other characters, then it's fun. When he is the main solo character, it gets boring very quickly because he is basically indestructible. There was a reason why the 80s Action Films stayed in the 80s and they died off then. There is a reason why action films transitioned into the 90s and 00s very differently. There is a reason why Casino Royale rebooted James Bond in a very different and gritty way where there were stakes involved where the character could hurt, and bleed, and lose. Never happens here. Not for a second. Thus, Skyscraper becomes no different than 2 hours of watching someone play a video game.I am so glad this film is doing terrible at the box office. It goes to show that audiences don't resonate with this in cinemas either. Don't get me wrong, I like Dwayne Johnson in certain movies but this was such a completely ridiculous premise that the film just goes on auto-pilot and you know how it's all going to turn out. There is never the suspense and thrill that you get from a better script and better director. Defending this sort of garbage as a popcorn flick is not even possible because it is shit. Even Rampage was better than this. Do yourself a favour and save your money. Rewatch the original Die Hard or ANY of the Mission Impossible films (3, 4, 5) and the upcoming 6. They all have real stunts, better stories and characters, etc. Money should be spent to support better quality, than on junk that has no redeeming value or quality.",Skyscraper

There was SO MUCH CGI I got what I like to refer as ""CGI BLINDNESS"" I don't know if anyone else is a sufferer? It's where there's SO much CGI happening on screen SO quickly you can't see anything beyond it. Somewhere amidst all the chaos a neuron between my eyes and my brain is not firing on all cylinders. I just can't distinguish what's happening with all the flashes and noise and a million reflections of The Rock in a tennis ball a mile in the sky. Who even knows what subliminal messages we are exposing ourselves to whilst all this computerised brainwashing ensues! Any sort of plot that existed in the movie - I'm not sure there was one- is overlooked by flashing lights and cgi nonsense. Also, I noted Dwayne Johnson must be rather accomplished at Parkour and not only does he sport a metal leg he obviously has grappling hooks for hands!The best thing about this movie was seeing SIDNEY for the first time in 20years and I'm sure at some point the rock tells her ""I'll be right back"" which probably triggered some pretty heavy ptsd!

517,troyparsons,Yes the rock,9,19 November 2021,"This science fiction film grabbed my attention from the beginning, because of its very interesting plot and fascinating storyline. It made me feel driven to discover what would happen at the end. From the beginning of the film, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, because it has a combination of topics that I love seeing in movies - action and suspense! These drew me in. I wanted to finally find out what the outcome of the movie would be. I also liked it because I admire Dwayne Johnson's exceptional work as an actor. He is very expressive with his actions and makes the audience empathize with what he is going through. Because of that, I always follow the movies he works in.Skyscraper is about a past FBI leader and war veteran called Will Ford who is now managing security programs for skyscrapers. He's been sent on a once-in-a-lifetime work opportunity to establish security measures for the tallest and safest building in the world, located in China. Suddenly, the skyscraper turns into flames and the security measures fail. He is the primary suspect since he is the only one authorized to control the security. As the story progresses, Will must find those responsible for the destruction in order to clear his name and somehow rescue his family who are trapped inside the building, above the fire line.My favorite scene in this film is when Will runs away from the authorities, climbs up the construction equipment, moves it so that it will point at a floor close to the fire line, and jumps towards a broken window. I love this scene because it shows what a man is capable of doing for his family's welfare. He risks his life in order to save them from the fire that is threatening their lives. Aside from that, I was astonished at all the special effects used to create this action sequence. The post production of this scene is flawless. It all seems as if it really happens. You don't notice the editing at all.The main message of this film is that family comes before anything else. Some people are driven to do the impossible because of the love they feel towards their family. In this film, Will's devotion to his wife and kids is very impressive and is admirable. It sends a very family oriented message and teaches a valuable lesson that can be applied to anyone's life. I rate this movie 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 and up.",Skyscraper

Yes, it definitely is. Does it bring any new ideas of its own into the movie industry? Um, well no. Obviously not. Their urge to appease the Asian audience is quite clear, setting the film in Hong Kong and stuff. It's all the more obvious with all the advertisements popping up every now and then in the movie. But that is not my complaint. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, the beloved star of Hollywood plays the role of Will Sawyer, an ex-military guy with an amputed leg. And when his family is in danger, he machos up and jumps right into the largest building in the world. And kicking some ass later on. To be honest, The Rock is alright in this film. Nothing extraordinary, not terrible. But what gets on my nerves is HOW much they've copied from other, much better films. Nearly one third of the hell that happens in the building is copied from Die Hard. There's one scene which is straight out of Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol. Not to mention, there are scenes in the movie which have been definitely seen before in one movie or another. The entire plot as to why the terrorists set the building on fire is cliché, as usual. Also, the entire building and facilities inside look fake as hell. To think they've spent 125 million on this! And the cheesiness in the dialogues! Holy hell!

Stop it. The death of film lies in giving money to films like these and praising them as entertaining summer blockbusters. Boy, do the directors just eat that stuff up. Audiences hear me now; stop settling for good enough or just entertaining. Ask for more from your filmmakers! Make them work to entertain you. Make them feel the need to put in some actual effort and think outside the bun. Otherwise, filmmakers will settle. They'll continue to feed you the same stuff you've seen before, only slightly different each time. Dare to be a sophisticated audience member because it really could be different.

But i can't say i didn't yawn a couple of times but this movie has its moments some of the action is truly thrilling but the story it self is a little predictable. I mean it basically makes you understand that no matter what nothing is gonna happen to Dwayne's character 'Will Sawyer' sure he gets some bruises and gets shot at a couple of times but basically no matter what he always over-comes the problems and outsmarts his enemies but Will has one leg and the other leg is cosmetic due to an explosion he was in 10 years ago because he and his crew were trying to free hostages because they were in hostage negotation, now it brings me to my point how does he always wins with one leg, if he has not been in action for 10 years how does a man like 'Will Sawyer' can do all this and come out with a few bruises and some gun shot wound that he barely feels? but hey no one said make every thing realistic just make the audience feel like 'Will Sawyer' is in actual danger.

Complete with the occasional one liner quips and throw-backs to dialogue planted earlier in the film.The jeopardy fees real and you end up caring for the main characters even if it is a little too predictable that they all get out alive... even the buildings owner has redeeming parts to him, though the film tries to play him as a cool, heartless industrialist... his motivations turn good.It's never going to be an Oscar contender but provides a 1h 40min ride that doesn't hold back on the action and draws you into the set-pieces that keep coming and keen delivering.",Skyscraper

I knew there was a chance it would have many cliches, but I have liked many movies with The Rock over the years.When it was revealed fairly early that his ""buddy"" was betraying him, I knew I was right about the cliches. I was prepared to handle that, but the writing was so lazy that it became stupid. The bad faction starts a fire in the building and takes over the offsite security location. But, Building Management makes no attempt to contact The Rock, their Security Consultant. The bad guys get The Rock to unlock the control tablet, but he makes no effort to contact Building Management to kill his access.I was already close to stopping the movie. Because the whole plot could have thwarted by having management lock The Rock's access out. (And of course, this ""highly secure building"" has security staff incapable of stopping anything. It seems like The Rock's character is not good at security consulting work.)When my wife and I had to stop watching was when the Media was already vilifying him. There would be no way a connection to him could be made, yet. Even if the media knew he had been hired as a security consultant, why would they already be jumping to blaming him, yet? The media don't even know about the group of thugs, yet. They just think it is a fire. It wouldn't read as a security breach, yet.They're probably are cool shots in it later.

628,corybolding,An hour & 42 minutes you'll never get back,2,12 March 2019,"I like the Rock. He's a charasmatic guy. And Neve Campbell is an actress. But this movie is beyond horrible.
The plot as a whole is terrible. An FBI agent (spoilers ahead) who is right next to a guy who blows himself up and the Rock loses his leg but only a couple scratches on his face? There's been plenty of myth buster episodes saying everyone in the room would be dead due to concussion trauma. They could have had him be the commander who sends men into their death and had the same effect.
But wait, then how would he meet his wife? That he wouldn't be allowed to date because he was her patient.
Flash forward, his family gets invited to be the only family living in a skyscraper?
Then they need to steal an iPad with facial reckognition but didn't care about getting the face that unlocked it, but later when they get it they need the face?
Then there's the jumping scene which was proven impossible by 1000+ trajectory lines people have calculated online.
Add to this the typical ""we put our female lead in heels that had plenty of time to get on comfortable practical shoes.""
Don't forget that the ""bad guy"" is in the movie for a grand total of 6 minutes, and is truly a waste of a plot line.
To top it off, when the fire suppression system comes back online at the end, it puts out the fire in 30 seconds, but when it was online when the fire broke out, the small fire burned for an hour.
Basically, the plot was not well thought out. The logic is lacking. And the script is abysmal. I hope they all got big checks for this movie, because they got robbed of the Razzie award they so rightly deserved.",Skyscraper

I knew nothing about the movie going in, so I was pleasantly surprised to see Neve Campbell in a lead role. It's cool to me (a 30 something woman) to see them cast an actress that I grew up with that isn't 25 with fake...everything. Thumbs up for that. Dwayne (I still call him the Rock) is really good in his role, looking buff and kicking butt.

658,mikeyspade,Not the Rock's best work,5,21 June 2020,"First off i'd like to go on record and say i'm a massive fan of Dwayne Johnson. If there is a film with the Rock in it, i always enjoy it and he really is 'the' action star of the present era.
Up untill very recently his films have been original, and tailored towards his physical prowess and boudless natural charm he brings to every movie he's in.
Thats why i was so dissapointed with this film. Its just a formula Die Hard clone with none of the character development and scriptwiting that made Die Hard the classic it was.
The Rock was as heroic as he always is in this film. They even gave him a dissability in this one. As if audiences believe it will be just too easy for him to defeat the bad guys unless he's hindered physically somehow.
We like the Rock to be a badass. Thats why he's such a star. We want to believe it.
The movie did'nt start off too bad in fairness. The idea of the film being centered around the tallest building in the world, with a floor level where the building literally dissapeared through holographic technology was interesting.
Once the bad guys starting shooting though it just got boring. I found i didnt really care about who they were, or for that matter who most of the good guys were. There was so little build up to finding out about these characters or what they wanted. That you weren't that botherd who got killed and who didnt.
What have we lost in Hollywood now. Characters good and bad used to be given back storys and reasons for who they were and what drove them. It made you root for the good guy, and either despise, sympathise or at least understand the bad guys motivation.
Here, you didnt know what the villians were really after untill 15 mins before the end, and even then it was an anticlimax. Talking of anticlimaxes. The way the Rock dispatched of the supposedly head villian was no classic Alan Rickman falling from the Nakatomi building moment. I wont give it away, but i blinked and it was over.
What a let down.
To sum up there are worse ways to spend a couple of hours, but its got to be the most boring film ive seen the Rock in to date.
I just hope the Rock does'nt make too many more of this kind of movie. It seems hes just there to pick up the pay check, which is a shame because Dwayne Johnson is great and deserves better than this.
Lets hope he can get back to making the kind of action films that he is so good at.",Skyscraper

There is nothing duck tape can't fix, if you have lots of it. And the movie does use a lot of duck tape. I had a brief hiatus from an intense project, so what better to do, than to leave my rational brain in the laptop bag and enjoy the movie. The story or acting is nowhere as believable as Towering Inferno. I have always envied the physique and the money The Rock has, and he does carry the movie entirely on his huge bulging shoulders. He escapes with his life so many times that I lost count. Makes you wonder if he's the luckiest man or, perhaps he's the unluckiest one.

690,sonneillonv,Surprisingly Better Than Expected,7,15 March 2019,"There are several classes of people who I think will appreciate this movie more than others, and it's a real shame this movie was not advertised specifically to those people. It's true that the plot is pretty basic. It's true that most of the movie runs on the Rule of Cool. It's true that the villains aren't particularly compelling - as much as this movie is compared to Die Hard, the lead villain is no Hans Gruber, and he has minimal personal involvement with the hero.So, where does Skyscraper shine?For one thing, it shines in its portrayal as a disabled veteran as an action hero. Dwayne Johnson's character has lost his left leg below the knee, and has a prosthetic which features prominently in the events of the movie. He's shown to have some difficulties, inconveniences, and even chronic pain from the prosthetic. He's also shown to have adapted to it, and uses it in creative ways to accomplish his goals and keep himself safe as he moves through the building. I honestly don't recall the last time I saw a physically disabled character given the role of Action Movie Hero - opinion among the masses seems to be that such people are incapable of pulling the stunts we associate with that role. It was really cool to see Skyscraper's creative team throw that idea out the window.Neve Campbell costars as Johnson's character's wife, and these two are #marriagegoals. Not only is she every bit as rough and tough as he is, the scenes in which they work together highlight that their marriage is one of profound trust between equals. She is given many opportunities to show her skills, from fluency in Mandarin to combat training, and frankly, I think the character comes out on top when compared to Holly McClane simply because she does more.If you go into this movie with a good sense of humor, expecting that the creative team did a number of things just because somebody thought it would be awesome, then you won't be disappointed. You might even be impressed. ""Heaven"" is a good example of this - there is literally no reason to have a combination hall-of-mirrors/holosuite at the top of the skyscraper, and the minute you see it in the film's beginning, you think, ""they put that in there JUST to stage a fight in it"", and you'd be right. As soon as you find out the building is powered by a set of giant turbines, you 100% know The Rock is going to have to jump into those turbines. It's just the rules of action movies.Skyscraper follows the rules, and in that sense it's very formulaic. But it also does some wonderfully unexpected things, showing a higher degree of thoughtfulness in concept of the main characters and their relationship.Because Skyscraper follows the rules closely, most of the movie works exactly as it's supposed to, and there aren't too many awkward spots or dead-ends. The only one is the presence of the Hong Kong police, and the fact that they believe, through most of the movie, that Dwayne Johnson is the bad guy. There really is no purpose to that except to add some pressure during the well-advertised crane scene, and possibly to mimic Die Hard more closely. In the end, when the Lt. tells Dwayne's character ""It's good to finally meet you"", you can tell it was supposed to be a call-back to the relationship between John and Al in Die Hard. The problem is, no such relationship was established, so the moment falls really flat. I understand the police should absolutely be present for the events of the movie - you can't light a skyscraper on fire without a police response. But their participation in the plot was flaccid at best.",Skyscraper

As such, the cops forget about the burining building and possible people that may need to be rescued in otder to pursue the rock on top of some tower next to it. The sad part is that throughout the entire movie, you do not even see the police or emergency teams make the slighetest attempt to enter the bulding. The just sit outside with the entire crowd of spectators watching the tower burn. There is so much other plot holes that just make you really feel bad for these writers, like the motive of the villain who decides to burn dowm an etire building just for some files. The worst part is that he dies in said building. It gets even worse, the wife of the rock escapes the building only to become a suspect along with her husband who is on the inside.

716,afinnmcguirk,Before there were superhero movies....,3,22 May 2019,"There were hero movies. Sly and Arnie were the kings and everywhere they went they left a wake of dead bodies. There were a lot of loners, a lot of men fighting the good fight but unable to deal with the misguided figures of authority above them. Men were real men. Sensitivity was for the hippies, pinkos and college kids. But that was then and this is now. Hero movies are certainly overdue a revival; the superhero movies have got out of hand. And Skyscraper is what we've been presented with...
It feels like a Frankenstein's monster of a movie, with parts stitched together but not quite hanging together. The technicalities of battling fires in a building reaching up into the sky feels very Towering Inferno, the action feels very Die Hard, the underlying premise of saving valuables in a fire comes from a Sherlock Holmes story and the hall of mirrors seems to be borrowed from Enter the Dragon. The Asian flavour in general seems to be a common theme in current Hollywood films, the underlying reason for which must be shifting demographics of movie goers (though I don't have evidence to support that). The borrowing of the hall of mirrors seems singularly pointless without using the explanation that the makers rifled through a bin of Chinese films to reference. The room in the pearl (looks more like a tennis ball) held aloft by the building seems preposterous. The external views could have been created with windows rather than high tech cameras. And the hall of mirrors serves only to provide a momentary plot twist. Very strange.
As for what's different.... The Rock hasn't proved impossible to manage due to his hardcore dedication and been stripped of his command - he showed too much kindness and got unlucky. He is ex military though, so that reassures the viewer that there is some tradition being incorporated.
He is big a la Arnie... but he's got a prosthetic leg. Unfortunately the nature of the action makes that uncomfortable viewing. There's a lot of running, leaping and climbing. He's already too big for the action (UK ninja warrior surely teaches us that you need to be lean and nimble) but the prosthetic leg makes him too lumbering to be remotely believable.
He doesn't have a broken marriage with no access to his kids - he's in a loving marriage with a wonderful relationship with his kids. Witness his wife straightening his tie (very 1950s feeling Hollywood shorthand for everything being right with the marriage) and being supportive. What kind of a man is this?! Luckily his wife almost exclusively hits other women (the insurance guy is pretty woman-y) and despite his wife being a surgeon her job doesn't seem of much importance. Not sure how woke this all is. In the 1950 it might have seemed quite right on.
Finally the villains aren't directly out for money and there are no psychopaths. In fact the underlying message seems anti-corruption, which I guess is a little new (?).
All in all I would say that in a genre that's crying out for a reboot this film is all over the place. It's not the progression it might think it is. More of a drunken, clumsy stagger, though perhaps the makers thought they were walking straight into the future.
Surely there were relatively fireproof stairwells to descend?

Every movie isn't made to win an Oscar (not that that makes something good anyway) nor does it need to have some feminist, LBGTQ, save the planet, hug a tree, anti-American, liberal agenda. Some movies are for entertainment. Most of the crap coming out of Hollywood nowadays have to have some deep thinking motive or be a comic book hero story. This movie is entertaining, fun, and it kept my wife, son, and myself on the edge of our seats from about 10 minutes in until the end. What's wrong with that? NOTHING!!!! Sometimes it's just fun to watch a movie and root for the good guys and be against the bad guys. I enjoyed it and highly recommend it. Don't read all the bad reviews and be dissuaded.

I know, its good for a mediocre fighting finale (something, that you can expect from the 10th minute of the movie), but why would any millionaire build it, especially on the top of a skyscraper, where you have the best view?... It feels like, that the writers didn't study skyscraper fire protocols at all (e.g. fire protected stairways), and the lack of firefighters is also really unrealistic. Moreover there are a lot of clichés (superhero veteran fighting for his family; a badass fighting nurse, who knows things better than a whole police depatment, etc) and stupid decisions (e.g. creating and giving away a tablet, which can control your whole building).

Skyscraper is a loosely connected series of set pieces, with all the clichés and regurgitated them in a humourless, lugging attempt at an action movie. To enjoy this one, it's best not even to think. Dwayne Johnson is a great action hero, but he seems to be in a perfunctory day in the office here and seems so out of sorts that we see him learning Mandarin phrases in Cantonese-speaking Hong Kong.Even the basic premise lacks credibility. A Chinese billionaire builds a gleaming, suggestively curved example of phallic architecture in Kowloon. The building supports a giant ball, which everyone wonders about. But why? Of course! He wanted his billion-dollar project to support a hi-tech Hall of Mirrors. I don't know why anyone would want to do this and we never find out its actual purpose other than to provide a venue for the final showdown with the baddies. I'm not sure why the billionaire didn't just put two balls at the base of his structure instead. Surely this would be much more stable and at least give us some relief from the chronic seriousness. 
The only consolation comes from the aerial views of Hong Kong, which incidentally, has been the setting for much better action movies. By way of disclosure. I had a couple of naps during the movie. But I don't think I missed much.",Skyscraper

785,ericbspencer,I like it but I don't,6,10 February 2020,"Right. First off, Dwayne Johnson, Neve Campbell & company were great. The acting was perfect. Yes it is basically Die Hard. If Die Hard was made with 90% cgi and no authenticity to the ""gunplay."" This may sound petty but I hate when an action film based on gunplay leaves out bullet contact. Y'know, when the ""bullet"" rips through a character's body part. Blood spurts. Sometimes dust or steam. Or even just the visible contact itself. An even spread of visible bullet contact can add authenticity to a gun fight. I personally don't like watching someone convulse to the ground pretending to have been shot. That's just me.
This movie is far from boring. The action picks up and keeps the momentum. A clever character for someone as physically big as The Rock to fit in just fine with average sized people. The action isn't TOO over the top. At the end the system has to be rebooted. What I don't understand is that more than half the building had been burning for some time. How is the system not fried or overheated or even still exist within the blazing inferno? Maybe I just don't know enough about electrical systems or engineering.
One last complaint I have, and this is personal. But I feel like 90% of this movie is cgi. If I wanted to watch an animation I'd watch a Pixar flick. It just feels so fake. I guess I just prefer practical effects over cgi. Back to my first complaint, they could've used some of those effects to add some visible bullet contact for those flat gunplay scenes. I can't stress enough how bad that bugs me. The walls were riddled but actual enemies got the easy way out. All in all, this is a good action movie but gritty realism isn't part of the charm. If you're like me, you'll be on the fence. Check out Snitch for the same emotional feel but a more realistic violent/action packed experience.",Skyscraper

My mind started thinking of what needs to be done around the house and what i have planned next week then suddenly i tried to concentrate again to a scene i could easily predict and guess what will happen next. 
Sorry but its really bad. Dwayne Johnson lets see you star in a non action film like The Gridiron Gang again. So much better.",Skyscraper

825,ludiklg,"Great movie, highly recommend",10,24 September 2018,"This was an awesome movie. I absolutely loved it. It has a good story, great acting, it is very suspencefull and has very ""hearattack inducing"" action (in a good way) at least for me. I was at the edge of my seat after things started happening and could take a full breath only at the end when it was over. My reaction to this was a lot of sweat and closing my eyes because i was scared for them 😀 and tears at the end. LOVED IT!!! Highly recommend it 👍👍👍👍👍",Skyscraper

828,brandongo-55769,Genuinely interesting,8,14 October 2018,"I'll keep it short:
Upside: It's suspenseful, has its moments of comedy too. It'll always keep you on your toes. 
Downside: If you look carefully you'll clearly see the plot of the film, it's sort of predictable.
Overall it's a pretty enjoyable movie.",Skyscraper

831,zahersvk,SO UNDERRATED,9,3 November 2018,"The rock is always amazing, I love this film. However it is not the movie you will watch ever, and it feels like the idea is not so original, but still one of the best movies made in 2018.",Skyscraper
832,kurtborst,Classic Action Flick,10,14 October 2019,All the haters on here are trippin. This movie presented an unnecessarily ridiculous situation for the Rock to lay the smacketh down in and show off some phenomenally emotional acting chops. Pure entertainment by a consummate professional.,Skyscraper
833,sharp_eye_movie_critic,Best action movie for a long time,10,20 December 2018,"The best thing about this is that in this movie there are a couple of scenes where it really take fright at if you look too focused.

Otherwise...
Not into shorthaired women with masculine hair-do
