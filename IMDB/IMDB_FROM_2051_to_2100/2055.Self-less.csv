0,SnoopyStyle,Tarsem Singh not right,5,12 April 2016,"Wealthy businessman Damian Hale (Ben Kingsley) is dying. He's estranged from his daughter Claire. Upon dying, he receives an experimental procedure from Albright (Matthew Goode) to transfer his consciousness into Mark Caguioa (Ryan Reynolds). He expected a lab raised body but he starts to recover memories which leads to Mark's wife Madeline (Natalie Martinez) and their daughter. Albright sends henchman Anton (Derek Luke) to take back Damian.This has a pretty interesting premise but the execution doesn't have the thrills or any tension. It's too flat for too long at the beginning. Ryan Reynolds' performance doesn't match Ben Kingsley. When the action starts, I'm not locked onto the character. It's surprising to realize the director is Tarsem Singh. His signature visual style is completely missing. His storytelling is still problematic. The idea for this movie holds some potential but Singh is not up to the task.",Self-less
1,Hitchcoc,Disappointing Development of a Neat Premise,5,12 February 2016,"I just could not get into this film. Ben Kingsley is a man who has been dealt a cruel hand. He is dying of cancer which diminishes the importance of his millions of dollars. He makes a deal with a secret group to go through a process called ""shedding,"" i.e., having his brain transplanted into what he thinks is an artificial body. Of course, we know he will do this. When he dies, his essence is placed in a buff young guy's body. Of course, now there are endless possibilities, but what he does, mostly, is play pick-up basketball. One day, he has a hallucination, or so he thinks. He sees a former self and he comes to realize that the body he inhabits is that of an actual person. Now everything interesting falls apart. It becomes a search for a daughter and wife with the evil scientists after them. I've seen this kind of stuff a million times. The ending is also about as contrived in pathetic as one can imagine.",Self-less
2,Prismark10,Meet the host,5,16 November 2015,"Tarsem Singh came to prominence as the director of REM's music video for Losing my religion.His debut film The Cell was strong on visuals but weak on narrative and a lead actress.In Self/less Ben Kingsley is a wealthy mogul Damian. He has terminal cancer but wealthy enough to go through a cutting edge procedure where his consciousness is moved to a healthier body. A process known as shredding.Damian is led to believe that the new body has been grown in a lab. Part of the process is that he must give up his old life and start with a new identity. New Damian (Ryan Reynolds) moves to New Orleans and pretty soon he is living live with his younger self to the full.However he has flashbacks which makes him have doubts to the origin of his new body. He has to take pills to suppress this and to complete the transference of the mind which can take several months.New Damian tries to uncover the origin of these flashbacks, he discovers that the host body had a previous life and not grown in a lab.Pretty soon the people behind this medical procedure are out to get him. It is a good job that the original host was in the army.The film starts slow with the Ben Kingsley segment. It is as Singh wants to infuse the film with visual tricks and has aspiration to make an art house action thriller.The plot has been done before, Anthony Hopkins in Freejack who wanted a younger man's body and had Mick Jagger as his chief henchman to Face/Off and Total Recall.Just as you are about to nod off, Kingsley makes way for Ryan and the film shifts gears. Now Reynolds reminds you nothing of Kingsley's character but at least once Reynolds discover that the host body had a past life, this becomes very much a generic action film albeit an entertaining one and Reynolds is just the right man to mix action with some pathos and even some tenderness here and there.It is all so predictable but good fun when the action scenes start. Singh pulls of some visual trickery in a restraint manner but this is a movie that looks like the producers re-cut the final film. Maybe it is better for it.",Self-less
3,nogodnomasters,THAT NEW BODY SMELL,6,29 April 2018,"EARLY PLOT SPOILERThe best way to watch this film is cold, having read no reviews including this one. Damian (Ben Kingsley) is a rich guy who has an opportunity to live on in another body under a new identity. It cost a bit, but beats death. He takes over the body of Ryan Reynolds and then BAM! we soon discover 30 minutes into the film we are watching a modern update of ""Hauser's Memory."" Once we figure out what the pills are for and are 36 minutes into the feature, we know how it ends, just how do they get us there.Ryan did a decent job of imitating the mannerisms of Ben Kingsley, yet his acting was lack luster. There have been a number of films on this topic, with this one being superior to say ""Hauser's Memory"" but then again, what isn't better than a 1970's made for TV film. Makes for a good rental.Guide: 1 F-bomb. Brief dark sex/nudity?",Self-less
4,kosmasp,Who am I?,7,19 October 2015,"There are certain things that men (or women for that case) should not mess with. As in what nature is giving or taking away from us. The movie might make a case of that, if you want to look at it that way. It's Science Fiction alright, but it does have a moral core in it, that you'll either like or dismiss.Whatever the case, I'm sure many like the general idea of the movie, and because it is a ""secret"", this could actually be going on right now. But whatever you believe (or not), this will challenge some of your views, for better or worse. It might be very easy to see where this is going, but it's still a ride worth taking (especially if you're fond of the genre)",Self-less
5,Sleepin_Dragon,You can never cheat death,8,13 October 2015,"In recent times it seems like a sci fi thriller is a tricky movie to master, and whilst I don't pretend that Self/less mastered it, it's a very watchable and enjoyable movie.'Billionaire Damian, a man responsible for enormous business deals, a big figure with the ability to buy whatever he wants, but not the thing he needs, a cure for cancer. Out with friend and fellow business man Martin a card is slipped into Damian's possession, Phoenix biogenic, with a message on the back of help. Damian attends and meets Professor Albright, who explains the procedure on offer, Damian's living consciousness can be transplanted into a new body, a body that's been cultivated. Damian accepts and wakes up a fit young man. Albright insists on meeting weekly, giving Damian the pills he must take without fail. As time goes on Damian starts having disturbing visions, the constant being a woman, little girl, and a pumpkin tower. Researching the tower he is led to St Louis, where he discovers the truth behind his new guise and the sinister Albright.I really did enjoy this movie, the concept was a good one, it was a clever plot. There were enough surprises and plenty of intrigue to keep you wondering.If I had one little niggle, it's that for me after the transformation to Reynolds it felt like a different film, it didn't feel seamless, maybe that was intentional, I felt they could have delved into the transition a little deeper, it seemed to happen to quickly.Lots of action scenes, really well directed, the effects were great too. I wish Google searches worked so quickly for me, Pumpkin Towers (All I'm saying. 11,300,000 results,) my he was lucky.Brilliantly acted, Kinglsey naturally has gravitas, he's so watchable. Ryan Reynolds was excellent I thought, I really enjoyed his performance, Matthew Goode I thought was outstanding, managing to be sinister without overplaying it. I love Michelle Dockery, but she was a little underused, just a bit part.8/10 Very watchable, surprisingly so.",Self-less
6,classicsoncall,"""Death has some side effects.""",7,3 June 2021,"This wasn't too bad considering the theme has been done countless times before with films like ""Total Recall"", ""Freejack"" and ""Face/Off""; that last one even contributing the idea of two non-related words to assume some semblance of meaning for a movie title. Still, there were some problems with the execution that the film makers decided to gloss over relative to the plot. I didn't think Ben Kingsley conveyed the idea that Damian Hale had only six months to live since he looked pretty healthy to me aside from those coughing spasms of his. And why 'Mark' became a transfer body was never made clear. His background in the military was alluded to, and he was obviously selected by Jensen/Albright (Matthew Goode) as a subject devoid of serious imperfections. There was also the scene where Damian's friend Martin (Victor Garber) expressed his doubt about Damian occupying a new identity until it was verified by describing their first business deal together. But Martin already knew such a procedure was possible because he had a replacement son via the same 'shedding' method. He could have been playing dumb but it didn't come across that way. What was gratifying was Damian's decision to cease taking the red pill in order for Mark to resume life with his reunited family. That selfless (ahh, there it is!) act reminded me of yet another story harking all the way back to my childhood days watching Rod Serling's 'Twilight Zone'. In 'The Trade-Ins' an elderly gentleman gave up his chance for a younger body when his finances didn't allow the same procedure for his wife, thereby accepting the inevitability of death at some point in the future. When faced with a tough choice, it's commendable to see a noble decision being made.",Self-less
7,lee_eisenberg,transferred memory with no brain,4,30 November 2015,"Tarsem Singh's ""Self/less"" has an interesting plot but weakens itself by going for action over plot. The movie doesn't develop the characters enough to make you care about them, and Ben Kingsley doesn't get anywhere near enough screen time. I recommend sticking to Singh's previous efforts (""The Cell"" and ""Mirror Mirror"").I see that this is a remake of John Frankenheimer's ""Seconds"". I've never seen that movie but I'd like to. The spate of remakes/reboots/superhero sequels has seriously gotten annoying. Among the great books that haven't gotten filmed is Kim Stanley Robinson's ""Years of Rice and Salt"", a hypothetical look at world history.",Self-less
8,blanche-2,interesting concept,7,21 July 2016,"I am always surprised to see Ben Kingsley in a small role - after all, he was Gandhi. But here he is again, as Damian, an extremely wealthy man who is suffering from terminal cancer. He finds a business card directing him to Professor Albright (Matthew Goode), who performs a medical procedure called ""shedding"", in which one's consciousness is transferred to young, healthy body that has been engineered. He decides to do it.After the procedure, he is given pills he needs to take daily. Now Young Damien, he changes his name, moves to New Orleans and has the fun of a young single guy for a time. He becomes friends with his neighbor, Anton.He forgets to take his medicine one day and begins to see visions, but Albright tells him it's part of the ""shedding"" process. Not convinced, he goes searching for a landmark he saw in his visions. He discovers that Albright hasn't told him everything.Exciting and ultimately sweet film with some good acting from Ryan Reynolds, Natalie Martinez, Victor Garber, and one of my favorites, Matthew Goode.Yes, there was a lot of action but I didn't think of it as an action film. I enjoyed it.",Self-less
9,LeonLouisRicci,Familiar StoryDone Better Elsewhere...Good Enough to be Worth a Watch,7,31 March 2016,"Enjoyable but Generic Entertainment from a Story that has been done Many Times in the Sci-Fi Genre. This one blends Action with some Fancy Visual distortions in the Mix forsaking any Deep Thought or any New Philosophical Musings. Ryan Reynolds does Acceptable Work and forgoes His usual Snarky Humor that is nowhere to be found in the Mainstream Script. The Film goes to great lengths to Appeal to Everyone and that's usually Not a Good Thing.The Action-Chase-Fight Scenes are Slick and so is the Overall Template of the Movie but it Lacks Soul. Could that be a Byproduct of the Shedding (the Mind/Body Swap that is the Plot). The Third Act is the Weakest as the Movie decides, well it's hard to Imagine what it decides because there's a bit of unnecessary confusion, it does Feel Flat and Formulaic, whatever it is.Ben Kingsley Fans are going to be Disappointed with His short Screen Time and the Actresses, except for the Little Girl, do Nothing to make this Better than Average. In Fact, both of them (Claire and Addie) are Irritating and Get on the Nerves.Overall, it is an Average Movie with just enough going for it that makes it Worth a Watch.",Self-less
10,CinemaSerf,Downton deals in dangerous drugs...,7,15 January 2021,"OK, so he was terrific in ""Gandhi"" (1982) but ever since, Sir Ben Kingsley seems to have struggled to play anything more substantial that a mid-rate baddie with sinister eyes... Here, sadly, he is no different as he portrays ""Damian Hale"", a ruthless billionaire property magnate who has a terminal illness. To try and cheat death, he arranges with a suitably duplicitous ""Albright"" (Matthew Goode) for his consciousness to be transferred into a new, fit, young ""Damian"" (the fit young Ryan Reynolds). Shortly after, though, his new life starts to become blurred with the memories of his host. Are they just hallucinations or is his host (""Ed Kidner"") fighting back; trying to re-assert control over his own mind and body? This conflict only heightens when ""Ed"" starts to put flesh on the bones of his ""dreams"" discovering a real family and a real chance of happiness away from the pill-addicted existence created by ""Albright"". Reynolds is good in these sort of films; he has a glint in his eye and a charm about him that forgives his rather wooden acting abilities. The pace, once we have dispensed with the older iteration of ""Damian"" picks up well with a fair smidgeon of action and a bit of romance with Natalie Martinez. It's way too long - the story becomes way to dependant on the charisma of the star too early on in this process, but red herrings there are to keep us guessing before a suitably incendiary conclusion. It won't win any prizes, but I quite enjoyed it.",Self-less

Dirty Little Secret: namely, the Rich and Powerful are snatching the bodies of Ordinary People to extend their lifetimes. Though most of SELF\LESS' running times is devoted to Ben Kingsley moving into Ryan Reynold's brain and body, director Tarsem Singh felt he could get away with dropping a few Real Life hints about some recent corporate moguls who seemed to ""come out of nowhere"" to suddenly chart America's course. Singh all but says that the Powers that Be transplanted Albert Einstein's brain into Apple mogul Steve Jobs' body. (The fact that Einstein's gray matter had ""gone missing"" about the time Jobs built his first Apple computer is well known to most informed Americans; where that mind is now is anybody's guess, as Singh points out that some intellects are on their fourth or fifth host body now.) Who's to say that Jennifer Hudson is not Leona Helmsley the Second or Third? In the end credits of this reenactment, Singh's primary thanks are given to one ""Donald J. Trump."" Maybe he's one of the ""Boys from Brazil."" Now, that's a scary thought!",Self-less
12,view_and_review,Solidly OK,6,17 February 2017,"This movie fell solidly into OK territory. It wasn't that good but also not that bad.A man by the name of Damian Hale (Ben Kingsley) is dying from cancer and has months to live at best. He opts for a highly experimental option to death which is essentially placing his life into a younger, healthier lifeless body. After being plagued by the memories of his new body, the young Damian (Ryan Reynolds) decides to investigate what he truly got himself into.Although it is not a cloning movie I kept having thoughts of The Sixth Sense. The movie is somewhat creative but not creative enough. It held my attention enough to watch it all the way through but I still had one eye on a book I was reading. There are some chase scenes and a steady peeling away of the onion but nothing groundbreaking.",Self-less
13,neil-476,"Quite good, could have been better",7,27 January 2016,"Squillionaire property developer Ben Kingsley is dying of cancer. What with money being no object, he buys a remedy which involves his consciousness being transferred into lab-grown Ryan Reynolds by shady scientist Matthew Goode, but it's not long before he discovers that all is not quite what it seems.This film starts off very promisingly with a strong science fiction premise then, about a third of the way through, it seems satisfied to settle into fitting a routine urban paranoia chase/thriller template. It ends up being OK - the end is pleasing, if predictable - but one is left with the taste of the film it could have been but wasn't, and I think that is a film I would have preferred.",Self-less
14,bombersflyup,Less/thanitappears,4,28 March 2018,"Self/less isn't a great film. Has a good concept but turns out being a run of the mill action film.I have seen many Ryan Reynolds's films and he wasn't really any different here. Which was a problem, because I had to keep reminding myself it was Ben Kingsley in his body, he didn't display any different mannerisms, tendencies or expressions that he normally would. So at the end when he decides to give his body back to its host and his family I was a bit confused, Kingsley was in Reynolds and some other guy's Reynolds. Kingsley's character gave up experiencing his second life pretty quickly, appears as though he got tired of playing ball and going to clubs. Why didn't he start fresh, living like he always has? Instead of making it his mission to fix these strangers lives. On that note, the wife/mother doesn't have the desired affect and is unevoking of any feeling. Anyway, it's all for naught as it turns into a chase shoot em up flick.",Self-less
15,anaconda-40658,Be Selfless and See This Film.,9,29 July 2015,"Self/less (2015): Dir: Tarsem Singh / Cast: Ryan Reynolds, Ben Kingsley, Natalie Martinez, Matthew Goode, Victor Garber: Title symbolizes two elements. First, it regards a selfless act where one places importance upon others over oneself. Secondly, it regards a decaying of conscience. This is all done within the bizarre visual framework often associated with Tarsem Singh who previously directed The Cell. Ben Kingsley plays a successful business man estrange from his grown daughter. He has terminal cancer and accepts an opportunity to immortalize himself through a procedure that passes his conscience to another reserved body. The procedure is successful and when he looks in the mirror he sees the image of Ryan Reynolds, whose character was a soldier. Things become complicated when medicine is skipped and flashback surface that cause a dizzying feeling. It is soon discovered that the soldier had a wife and daughter whom were kept in the dark to what really happened. Kingsley is featured strongly within the film's first twenty minutes. He feels regret and the need to press forward despite his condition. As Reynolds he learns self sacrifice and using his new skills to seek out the truth. Natalie Martinez plays the wife of the Reynolds character until she is filled in that it is another conscience inside his body. Matthew Goode plays the villain who cooked up this experiment that bares consequences that he hopes to control. Victor Garber plays an associate of the Kingsley character who is entangled in this scheme. Well made with typical over the top action yet fans of the genre will lose themselves within it.

16,FlashCallahan,Life/less,4,31 August 2015,"Billionaire industrialist Damian Hale is master of his universe, until he encounters a foe that he can't defeat.......metastasis. His only hope is a radical medical procedure called ""shedding,"" in which his consciousness is transferred to a healthy body. After the procedure, Damian, now called Edward, starts a new life in New Orleans, but he's haunted by disturbing images. When he delves into Edward's past, he learns that some will kill to keep it secret.Tarsem Singh isn't the greatest director in the world, by a long-shot, but his previous films have shown us that he is a visionary. The Cell was a load of old cobblers, but when we went into the mind of the killer, it was gloriously bonkers. The Fall is his masterpiece, beautiful, subliminal, but again, bonkers.The Immortals was a horrid affair, but it's set design was beautiful. Here, I wasn't looking for much, other than something luscious to look at, and Kingsley is always good for a slice of ham, but I didn't get anything other than déjà Vu to other films, the Island, In Time, Paycheck and Face/off (and Kingsley, even though he's in it for a short time, is ironically the best he's ever been for a very long time).It starts well enough, and the concept is sound. Like another film not dissimilar to this 'In Time' the film is telling you, if your rich, you can proverbially live forever. With 'In Time', time was literally money. In this film, if you are poor, you can sell your healthy to help your family, and if you're rich, you can buy it and have your soul somehow transferred into a good looking Ryan Reynolds type body.And as soon as the transition is complete, this is where the film falls flat on its face and loses everything it had going for it, which is ironic seeing as this is the exact point where Kingsleys' character is given a new lease of life.But the biggest problem here is Reynolds, I like the guy as an actor, and even though he's made some poor career choices over the last few years, he always breathes a bit of life into the whole proceedings.But here, he's totally autonomous as young Damian, and he hasn't put an ounce of effort into copying Kingsley's traits for effect (that's why Face/Off worked so well).So for the rest of the film we see Reynolds almost begrudgingly try and build a relationship with the wife and daughter of his new body's former owner.Goode turns up every now and again as Basil Exposition doing its best Agent Smith impression, and when we finally get to the rationale as to why this was done and how, you couldn't care/less about what happens to anyone.With virtually no advertising campaign on its initial release, it's no surprise that this soon vanished from cinemas.A Worth/less, soul/less dud of a film, but Kingsley is brilliant.",Self-less
17,gradyharp,'Immortality has some side effects.',8,27 November 2015,"Spanish brothers David and Alex Pastor wrote the story and produced the screenplay for Indian director Tarsem Singh of this a bit off the wall story of shedding – or transfer of consciousness into another body. The idea is fine and the acting is very fine but somehow the telling of the story gets sidetracked into a bit too much back-story to make the film flow smoothly.The brief synopsis (without all the paraphernalia imposed on it during the telling) is a dying real estate mogul Damien (Ben Kingsley) transfers his consciousness into a healthy young body of an ex-soldier Mark (Ryan Reynolds), but soon finds that neither the procedure nor the company that performed it are quite what they seem. The head of the company is one Albright (Matthew Goode) and imparts a sense of sci-fi feeling that dilutes the plot. As the story unfolds we discover that Mark has a wife (Natalie Martinez) and child for whom he sold his body to Albright's company for funds to aid his ill daughter to use in the act of shedding for Damien. We are able to watch the process of consciousness transfer and the new life that Damien (in Mark's body) and that is well done. But as Albright says to the questioning Damien the younger aka Mark, 'as you slip away, do you feel immortal? We offer humanity's greatest minds more time to fulfill their potential. Designed to offer you the very best of the human experience.' Were it not for Ryan Reynolds' ability to carry off this intellectually absurd role the film would likely fail. He is supported by a fine cast that includes (besides Kingsley, Goode, and Martinez) Victor Garber, Derek Luke, and Michelle Dockery.Definitely a film for sci-fi fans, but it raises questions about brain manipulation that give us pause to think.

I was just expecting a mystery thriller but it is more science fiction then mystery. The movie is different from the usual stuff we see. A nice innovative script about what almost everybody would want, immortality. Of course it's only available for the super rich. If it would ever happen in real life that's how it would turn out also. Only the super rich can afford everlasting youth. The movie is very entertaining. You never get bored for one second. A lot of action, a couple twists, and good acting from the whole cast. Ben Kingsley doesn't play a large role at all, it's Ryan Reynolds that has the major role and he does it very well. Self/less deserves a higher rating then it actually has on IMDb.

19,KineticSeoul,"Inventive, but not that entertaining",6,5 September 2015,"I did like the concept of this movie, which is about sending a person's conscience into another body. And I did like the dilemma aspect of this movie. The choice between morality and immortality. However the lack of character depth, such as the role played by Ben Kingsley. On more about what kind of character he is and more on what he accomplished. The movie started to go down hill when it started to lose focus on the concept and premise and go on this action direction. Mainly because it seemed like the movie was losing focus and because the action sequences just wasn't that good or entertaining to sit through. From there on the movie just seemed to go in a way too familiar and predictable direction. However the movie does have an essence of humanity which got to me.

20,Hellmant,"An entertaining, and somewhat thrilling, action flick",7,13 July 2015,"'SELF/LESS': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A sci-fi thriller/action flick starring Ryan Reynolds and Ben Kingsley. The story revolves around a dying businessman who has his consciousness transferred into the body of a younger, and much healthier, man. It was directed by Tarsem Singh (the man also responsible for the popular 2000 horror flick 'THE CELL') and written by David and Àlex Pastor. The movie also stars Matthew Goode, Natalie Martinez, Derek Luke and Victor Garber. The filmmakers do very little with their interesting ideas; but they do deliver a fun, and stylistically thrilling, action flick.Kingsley plays Damian, a wealthy, and very successful, businessman; who's dying from cancer. A secret, groundbreaking, science organization offers to give him a new body; to extend his life. After going through with the procedure Damian is thrilled with his newfound youth, and very physically fit body, but he quickly learns that his happiness came at the expense of someone else's (the man who's body he took). Damian feels extremely guilty for taking another man's life from him, and he wants to set things right. The special organization will stop at nothing though, to protect their business.The movie starts out as a pretty intriguing science-fiction thriller; similar movies have been done before but it did seem somewhat fresh and unique. It doesn't really develop into much though, as it prefers to entertain it's audience with stylistically cool action scenes; instead of story and character development. Singh is a very visually satisfying director to watch though, and I really like the dark style and mood of this movie. It's hard to give it credit for a lot more than that; but it is an entertaining, and somewhat thrilling, action flick.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40tcsSNoQmo",Self-less

But then he is approached to be part of a pioneering new experiment, where his body is swapped with that of a fitter younger man (in the shape of Ryan Reynolds.) For a while, he is free to rediscover the freedoms and agility of his younger days, but then flashbacks of the former existence of his younger body start to simmer in his mind, and he is embroiled in a race against time when he learns the sinister truth of the experiment he's a part of.Renowned for his flashy visual effects, director Tarsem Singh here has a surreal sci-fi story on his hands, of the type Phillip K Dick is renowned for. With well known talent Kingsley making way earlier on for hot new property Reynolds, the stage is set for an exciting roller-coaster ride, but, despite Self/Less's interesting premise, it just never delivers.Something this far fetched would have to have a really seat edge feel to it to really pay off, but rather than let the potentially interesting idea really develop, by the end all it's really done is overwhelm you and left you feeling all isolated and cold, and uncaring towards its conclusion.

24,851222,Generic action thriller flick that at least tries to have fresh take on formula,8,22 November 2015,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Self/less"" (2015) plot is kinda fresh take on old themes. It isn't highly original, because it is more or less takes the ideas from previous movies like ""Total Recall"" and etc. Not that i wasn't entertained. When ""Self/less"" plot reached that point when our hero started to hallucinate (lets just leave it at that) and see some flashbacks, i knew the same moment where it was headed and exactly how it will end. It didn't surprise me, because it all turn out precisely like i though - that is because ""Self/less"" isn't very smart or original, but it is an enjoyable ride, where ride itself is more satisfying then destination. Acting was OK by all involved, but i did miss a bit Ben Kingsley's character inside Ryan R. after the ""invasion"" - it was more or less Ryan R.Overall, ""Self/less"" is enjoyable action thriller flick which tries to mascaraed under some high concept thriller which it isn't.

Plenty of large and small scale flicks came out and among them I was eagerly waiting for this one. If the story is what you always prefer with a fine production quality, then this film won't disappoint you. The performances were also well supported. Then what was this film's issue?The last time widely accepted movie by Tarsem Singh was when he engaged in the screenplay development. After that he did not see much success where all his directed ones were written by others. My perception is that he must do those both department where he's good at it. Take this film as an example, an awesome story and had a good cast, but the writing was let down according to many who saw it.Even in the short period of appearance, Ben Kingsley's role's legacy carried out till the end, because the concept was designed like that way. Being one of the top actors, Ryan Reylands films are not that celebratable. Though he's doing a decent flicks often and those were failing to recognise in the higher level, which did not spare this one as well.People are comparing it to 'Face/off', but to me it looked more like coming together of 'The Island' and 'Skeleton Key'. Whatever it is I had a good time. Not a fresh concept of an idea, but narrated differently and it needed a bit depth in showcasing everything in the film.My formula/secret for watching a movie successfully even it considered as an average or worse is, I won't bother for all the departments come together to become a well crafted product like the critics expect, because I'm a movie fanatic and love watching them almost most of the time than arguing about its flawed contents. If I find anything solely interesting like acting, music, story, visuals, I respect the efforts. So do I to this one and believe me it is much better than what the critics say so.7/10",Self-less
26,paulclaassen,Interesting premise becomes formulaic...,5,4 May 2019,"The film offers an interesting concept for maintaining youth, but - as we soon discover - all is not as it seems and not as promising as initially thought. I enjoyed Ben Kingsley in the film's first moments. Ryan Reynolds is a very good actor, and yes, a delicious one at that, who offered enough eye candy.This is the first of Tarsem's films to not feature his trademark stunning costumes, visuals or set designs. Interestingly enough, this is also the first of his films to not win any awards, or even a nomination. Although the film is interesting enough with lots of exciting action, I somehow just didn't buy into it. It became formulaic and didn't really bring anything new to the table despite the initial theme. The final act was fast-paced and exciting, although the ending was predictable.",Self-less
27,Floated2,Decent but have been greater,7,9 April 2016,"Self/Less is one of the latest film starring superstar Ryan Reynolds. The film isn't inherently dull, but the execution is. The script doesn't explore what it's like for an elderly man to live life in the body of a young hunk except for a brief montage in which the young Damian goes partying in New Orleans for an extended period of time. The twists in the script are all quite similar, too: once the possibility is introduced that one person's mind can be shuttled into another person's body, the possibility that many of the characters in the film are not who they seem compounds. If the script utilized this switch once, it might be legitimately surprising.First from for most, Reynolds doesn't do a magical job of impersonating Kingsley's mannerisms, but then, the script doesn't seem to want him to. Of the ensemble, only Matthew Goode leaves unscathed. The film did flop at the box office which is why people are seen to later discover it, as many are considering it a ""gem"" of a film. Self/less for its premise could have been far greater, had the writing been more precise and thought out. There could have potential for more plot twists and turns, but what the end result is, is quite disappointing.==================================================================== ====================================================================As a rewatch 08/10/17' Self/less is a quality sci-fi film but not as great. It is more enjoyable on multiple viewings as the pace runs smoothly. Some things are more noticeable and clearer which was somewhat confusing on a initial watch. The film does contain a intriguing plot which makes the twist worth watching until the end, with a typical happy end but overall it could have been better. Overall, Self/less is quite underrated, rating changed from 5 to 7.",Self-less
28,leonblackwood,Another mediocre movie from Reynolds! 4/10,4,15 November 2015,"Review: This is another case of a director over complicating a decent concept! The root of the film is straight forward but when the main character starts to get these mysterious visions, the whole storyline goes pear shaped. The main concept is about a wealthy architect called Damian whose dying of cancer. He then hears of a experimental procedure that can transfer his consciousness into a younger body, so he goes ahead with the operation after faking his own death. The now, younger Damian (Ryan Reynolds), enjoys his new found wealth by partying with his new friends and sleeping with many ladies. After a while, he starts to get visions of the younger Damians past which goes against the company who done the procedure and the more that he digs into his past is the more his life becomes in danger, along with the original Damians daughter and wife who are following him on his journey. He also has to find the recipe for the medication that is keeping him alive so there's a race against time whilst he's fighting off the companies hit men. The main problem that I found with this movie is that the older Damian is nothing like the younger Damian whatsoever. He basically should have spent some more time piecing his visions together whist getting enough medication to stay alive except for going on a wild goose chase without a clue about what he was doing. The ending was also confusing because he ""all of a sudden"" worked out how to reverse the procedure. On the plus side, there is a sense of intensity throughout the movie which keeps it interesting and there are a couple of decent action scenes but you never really get a deeper insight into the younger Damians past. You literally have to piece his visions together yourself because the movie is mostly about Damian fighting against the company. Anyway, the sketchy script and constant random events became a bit too much for me and I ended up having to watch the movie twice to get the gist of it, which isn't good from my point of view.  Average!Round-Up: Ryan Reynolds is another one of those promising actors who can do action and comedy very well but he has picked some terrible projects. On paper, the Green Lantern and R.I.P.D. should have pushed him to major stardom but both films flopped at the box office and he has struggled to come out of the slump ever since. He's had small roles in Ted and a Million Ways to Die in the West but films like the Voices, Woman in Gold and Buried, we're he played the main role, didn't get that much attention. With 5 movies in the pipeline which include Deadpool, Croods 2 and the Hit-man's Bodyguard starring Samuel L. Jackson and Gary Oldman, at 39 years old, he's still got plenty of time to hit the $Billion mark. This movie was directed by Tarsem Singh, 54, who brought you Mirror Mirror with Julia Roberts, Immortals and the Cell with Jennifer Lopez. His filmography is pretty small so he hasn't got that much experience behind the camera so he wouldn't have been my first choice to take on this complex storyline. I was shocked to see Michelle Dockery from Downtown Abbey, playing the elder Damians daughter and I was surprised that Derek Luke didn't get a bigger role. Anyway, it's another mediocre movie from Reynolds which seemed interesting after watching the trailers but it failed to fully satisfy.Budget: $26million Worldwide Gross: $22millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/drama/mystery movies starring Ryan Reynolds, Natalie Martinez, Matthew Goode, Ben Kingsley, Derek Luke, Michelle Dockery and Victor Garber. 4/10",Self-less
29,lisafordeay,Actually very good from the director of The Cell,6,8 April 2021,"Selfless is a 2015 sci fi drama starring Ryan Reynolds, Ben Kingsely,Victor Garber,Matthew Goode and Michelle Dockery.

It was an action packed drama helped out with an incredible musical score. It kinda has the same vibe as a movie called Limitless starring Bradley Cooper and Robert DeNiro.

31,Turfseer,"Body swap Sci-fi premise subsumed by non-suspenseful, generic action ""thriller""",3,30 December 2016,"Self/less is called a ""science fiction thriller"" but there's little sci-fi here at all. It's based on a much earlier flick from the 60s, Seconds, directed by John Frankenheimer. As with its predecessor, the plot involves an older man's soul transferred into the body of a much younger individual. In this case the older man is Damien Hale (Ben Kingsley) who's dying of terminal cancer. He's a business tycoon worth billions but regrets his estranged relationship with his daughter, an attorney for a non-profit who champions liberal causes.Hale finds out about a Professor Albright who has developed a technique called ""shedding,"" enabling the transfer into a younger man's body. Albright however lies to Hale stating that the new body has been artificially grown. After Hale goes through the shedding procedure, he wakes up in a new body (Ryan Reynolds) and is given a new identity as Edward Kidner. Albright gives Kidner special medication to prevent hallucinations, but soon Kidner figures out that the hallucinations are memories of an actual person Albright used as Hale's new substitute.Kyle Smith writing in the NY Post points out one of the major flaws of the film involves Reynolds' performance which ""doesn't even bother to maintain a consistent personality between the two bodies inhabited by the same mind and soul. Kingsley's character is a total bastard but Reynolds's is cool, relaxed and kind-hearted, part frat boy and part golden retriever.""A larger problem is with the plot which sheds any pretensions to good science fiction and devolves into a mindless action ""thriller."" Kidner soon seeks out his wife and child from his past life and finds out he used to be a former soldier named Mark; he seeks to save them from Albright and his men who consist of a multitude of bad guys armed to the teeth and bent on doing Kidner in--as he poses a threat to expose the organization for its unethical use of live subjects. No need to recap most of the rest of the plot which features a series of standard chase scenes and shoot-em-ups. Kidner of course ultimately dispatches his unpleasant opponents and also discovers that going off the medication restores him to his former self—that's of course what he does but before Hale disappears entirely, he has one last touching moment with his estranged daughter and then leaves a parting video message for Mark explaining everything that's transpired.Self/less has all the hallmarks of a straight to cable production although it did make a modest profit during a live feature release, bolstered by some success in the foreign market. While there are other films out today that are far weaker than this, it's still should be regarded as thoroughly mediocre.",Self-less

33,stevendbeard,Average Action Thriller,6,11 July 2015,"I saw ""Self/Less"", starring Ryan Reynolds-Green Lantern, The Amityville Horror_2005; Natalie Martinez-End of Watch, Death Race_2008; Matthew Goode- The Imitation Game, Watchmen; Victor Garber-Argo, Alias_tv and Ben Kingsley-Iron Man 3, Gandhi.This is a little thriller that has some similarities to a 1966 movie with Rock Hudson in it called 'Seconds'. I don't know if it is based on it or not-I did not read anything saying that it was-or even if it is a remake of some kind. Anyway, in this one, Ben-who basically has a cameo role-plays a very wealthy business man that is also very sick with cancer. Matthew contacts him, saying that he can help him with his little cancer problem, for a price-I think $250 million is some price! Mathew has a new medical device that can transfer a man's consciousness from one body to another. The process even has a fancy name, Shedding-kind of like a snake shedding his skin. Matthew tells Ben that they actually grow the new bodies that they need for each client-Ben lucks out and gets Ryan's body. One of the conditions of the transfer is that Ben can not associate with anyone from his former life-everyone has to believe that he is dead, so his death is faked in a public place. Another one of the conditions is that he has to take a pill every day until his body adjusts. Ben gets all his affairs in order with Victor, his attorney/friend and goes all in with his new life but then, problems start making him rethink his decision. He misses a pill and he has a flashback/vision with Natalie in it. He finds out that his new body was not grown but ......well, they got it somewhere else. The pills he takes are to suppress the original person's consciousness until the new resident can take complete control. There are car chases, gun battles and some of the usual fisticuffs to make it an average action movie. It's not a bad movie, just kind of average. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, language and sexual content and has a running time of 1 hour & 56 minutes. I don't think I would buy it on DVD but it would be alright as a rental.",Self-less

Of course he soon finds out (now as Ryan Reynolds) that neither the procedure or the company are quite what they seem.I appreciated the uniqueness of this story unfortunately it could have been better. When Ben wakes up in Ryan's body he no longer acts like Ben, any of his mannerisms or oldness and they also should have played more into Ben discovering that his body knows how to do spy stuff like fighting, basketball etc. maybe Jason Bourne style instead of focusing on peanut butter.

36,aharmas,180 degrees,6,14 July 2015,"There could have been so much more here, coming from the director of the ""The Fall"" (a gorgeous and interesting premise) and ""The Cell"", which took you into the darkest recesses of the mind. Here comes the mind again, and how one's mind and identity travel to a better vessel only to discover that there were a few questionable acts on the process.Ryan Reynolds plays the new and improved version of Ben Kingsley's old soul. The idea is that once your body goes, you can shed the old shell and inhabit a perfectly new specimen. What happens when you discover that whatever you were promised is a bit tainted, and you might be damaged goods in more ways than just the physical way.I was a bit mixed up with the first fifteen minutes of the film, with the whole idea of redemption and the motives behind Kingsley's new acquisition. He lives in what must be the biggest and most ostentatious set up in New York City. He has lived a pretty selfish life, abandoning his daughter and ruining whatever possible chance of a relationship he could have. Now he's remorseful, and when he has a new body, he discovers he has a bigger soul. Or is it possible he always had it? It certainly didn't look like when he was Damian, but when is Mark, he's all heart, isn't he? Problem is that when he ""changes his mind"", he does ""change his mind"", and we go from Science Fiction to Rambo on the loose, with a touch of Mission Impossible, and a few other labyrinthine turns.We have a faithful friend, an ex-army buddy who is more lethal than anything Indiana Jones could encounter, and we have the devious scientist, marvelously played by Matthew Moode. It just keeps getting more and more complicated, still it's not like ""Looper"" where the gears were all well synced and greased. Here, the whole machine struggles with the concepts, the execution, and the editing. It never really feels like we are in the middle of a thriller, but it is more of a rehearsal. Even that child feels a little manipulative.It appears as if movies about mind trips or exchanges struggle in the big screen.

37,Seraphion,"A great sci-fi concept, too bad the thriller parts didn't quite match up",6,29 August 2015,"The movie's science fiction concept about a way to cheat death is not new indeed. But the way to cheat death that the movie presents is. And the complications that follows which creates the story's developments are genuinely interesting. Indeed after I learned of the concept, what's at stake and the possible choices for Damian, I stayed watching only to know what would Damian do. It's too bad that the thriller parts of the movie didn't really live up to the sci-fi element. The thriller seems very much abrupt, having the transitions between them feel odd. Also the general depiction of the surroundings in the movie seems strange, there's too few people here and there, even when the scene takes place in the French Quarters in New Orleans. This adds up to the movie looking so strangely lonesome. The acting overall is just at a standard Ryan Reynolds. He tried hard to get into his character but it's very apparent that he and Ben Kingsley didn't really had any cooperation in how to depict the same characteristics for Damian. In their relatively small part Ben Kingsley and Victor Garber did well in setting up the buildup for the main conflict. Natalie Martinez and Matthew Goode did also well in completing up the movie's story angles.",Self-less

Although ""Self/less"" isn't a straight remake, the basic idea of a secret corporation giving a man the opportunity to swap his old body for a healthier, younger version is the same in both movies. But in each case, the old life is hard to shake off.""Self/less"" has been accused of taking a good idea and then losing it in a routine action flick. True to a degree, especially at the mid-point, but the film also has a complex plot beyond the bullet impacts, screeching automobiles and mixed martial arts' blows. Eventually we understand the motivation behind the whole thing and the story has a fairly satisfying conclusion.Of course, if you have seen ""Seconds"", comparisons are inevitable. That older, thought-provoking film, features possibly Rock Hudson's best performance, and doesn't go down the action-orientated route at all. It works the consequences of body exchange in a different way until it reaches a more downbeat ending.Ben Kingsley gives ""Self/less"" some early gravitas, but Ryan Reynolds as three different identities in the same body is hardly off the screen thereafter. If the movie has failings they are not down to him; although he is a serious dude, he handles the action scenes and the intimate ones with equal aplomb.I must admit that the rather by-the-numbers action scenes in ""Self/less"" tend to pigeonhole the film in a certain category. Without most of them, the intriguing plot could have been developed at a more leisurely pace – some of the trickier points were rushed and you had to be quick to pick them up.With all that said, ""Self/less"" is a slick package that presents a challenging scenario although delivered at a breakneck pace.",Self-less

44,maurice_yacowar,Egotist learns to save younger man's life and family instead of his own.,8,23 July 2015,"Two phrases encapsulate the theme of Self/Less. Obviously, the title is the first. A self grows into selflessness. A rampaging egotist — Ben Kingsley as geezer Damian — discovers the virtue and satisfaction of submitting to the well-being of others. The very selfish real estate mogul surrenders his own character to preserve and to free the young man whose body he has taken over (Ryan Reynolds as young Damian). Ironically, the last scene is on an island in the Bahamas, where Damian has freed his body to resume the young man's family life with his wife and the daughter he sacrificed his life to save. The setting evokes Donne's ""No man is an island."" The geezer has learned community and social responsibility.Which brings us to the second phrase: The Community Coalition is the non-profit public service organization the geezer's alienated daughter Claire has founded. The original Damian had no time for his daughter because he was too consumed with building his personal empire. When he tries to connect it's too late. His checkbook fatherhood won't work. The extension of his life enables him to make an emotional connection — sans checkbook — that he couldn't in his lifetime. That's his young body's last service to him, which he reciprocates by giving up his character's life for the young man to resume his.The minor characters replay the theme in slighter ways. The gunsel the villain scientist keeps resurrecting grows more loyal with every new life he's given. Damian's longtime partner Martin introduces him to the Frankensteinian ""shedding"" in gratitude for his success. Where Damian uses the new science to preserve himself, the ever more generous Martin used it to revive his dead young son. He's appalled to learn that came at the expense of another family's loss of their son. The villain scientist claims to be animating a new combination of tissue, but he's really ending one life to use the body for another. That's where good science goes bad. That's also where good politics goes bad: when the innocent are forced to make the sacrifice for the powerful. This is a fascinating new take on a classic horror/sci-fi tradition: man's burgeoning scientific powers enable powers previously the province of the gods. That infernal presumption is imaged in the villain's death by flamethrower. Damian's last name is ""Hale"" — unfitting for a man whom we meet when he is far from hale and hearty. His healthy generosity at the end earns his name.",Self-less

46,Snootz,Mediocre sci fi continuity mess,5,20 September 2019,"I hate to shout ""The Emperor has no clothes"", but when one sees the number of 8 to 10-star ratings here for this flick, it becomes apparent that a whole lotta people don't know good cinema from their hind end.Not that it's wrong to say ""I really really liked this movie. 10 stars!"" Different people have different tastes and for some, this is a thrill ride and that's all they're looking for. But rating a movie and REVIEWING a movie is two different things. It's amazing how many people seemed to miss the numerous flaws in this production.The major inconsistency is the total dissimilarity between Kingsley and Reynolds representation of the main character. To maintain continuity and story line, more time should have been spent on establishing Kingsley's personality and mannerisms (instead of rushing him off screen ASAP)... and those mannerisms should have carried strongly to Reynolds. Most notable was Kingsley's strong and unique accent... none of which was present in Reynolds. Since they chose for Kingsley to affect an accent in the first place, why not Reynolds'?But it doesn't stop there. There is no similarity whatsoever between the short glimpse we get of Kingsley's character as a person and Reynolds follow-up. They are as different as night and day. Some of this could logically be attributed to storyline explanations, but compete loss of everything Kingsley presented during the first of the film is simply bad writing and directing.The plot was nothing new. It's been done before and better. Still, that's not a problem if the story is done well. This wasn't. The concept had great potential and a fine (if highly predictable) resolution... but the majority of the film was basic sci fi action / chase scenes / combat / car wrecks... which while well done and ""exciting"", fairly ruined the potential of the film.If you're looking for action adventure and a rather high body count, this film has it. If you're looking for good, meaningful sci fi... there's not much of that here. Add to this fairly weak characters (both mother and child), cliche characters (the evil mad scientist), even more cliche characters (no shortage of henchmen to shoot in this one!), and we have a plot line that is mediocre at best.Many reviewers here found these same flaws, and it's gratifying to see that they demand more of a film than ""Wow, it had really great fight scenes!"" and a high intentional-kill body count.This film could have been so much more, dug much deeper into personalities and relationships, examined and debated the ethical situation in greater detail, and certainly resolved that ethical situation in a far-less-cliche manner. As it turns out, it's just another sci fi adventure flick that leaves so very many stones un-turned.

48,kuarinofu,Very simplistic and misguided (not good sci-fi either),5,2 February 2020,"This film is full of underdeveloped ideas and concepts. It's starts off somewhat promising, but along the way it just transforms into Schwarzeneggers The 6th Day re-make (which wasn't great in the first place) with flamethrowers.First of all, the film looks like it's set in present time, but it handles consciousness transfer as nothing mind-blowing or groundbreaking. Just imagine what can be achieved when you can imprint any human being inside another one. Some great and dangerous ideas are here. But no, the film uses this very poorly. They should've set this far into the future to make it something ordinary or take it more seriously if it was set in modern times.Second, we don't get nearly enough old Kingsley character to understand his motivations. He's all over the place. He takes the transfer easily and starts enjoying life which he didn't seem to enjoy in the first place as much. They give you a couple of hints that he still feels young at heart, but it all falls down to picking beautiful women in clubs and having sex in his luxury apartments. This would've made the dilemma much stronger, the choice between retaining his young body and returning a father into the family.Third, the ending was way too obvious and was super easy to achieve. Damien just gave it up like it mattered nothing to him. He is not nearly believable as a property mogul. There is no transition in him from a selfish person and the self-sacrifice makes no sense. His motivations overall just make no sense. He's way too caring for a random person when it is clearly not his character. I mean, there is so much you can do with this concept. Just make him suffer, try to go to his daughter and reconnect, make her reject his younger version.Forth, the main ""villain's"" motivation also makes no sense. He looks like a smart person at first, but as the story progresses he just becomes a money-obsessed crook, and in the end for a minute he spits out childish philosophy.I mean, I wanted to see the film only for the concept of immortality and it's price, but instead I got lots of pointless action scenes The 6th Day's style.Also, the main female lead's voice was annoying, sorry.Maybe I expected too much from Tarsem.P.S.

The story is a good one and the film moves at a good pace, fast enough to keep you interested but not so fast as to lose the thriller element.I seriously wonder how movie critics and reviewers get and keep their jobs. If a movie says 'Critics are raving about...' I will tend to give that movie a wide birth.As for this under rated movie, it is well worth a watch.",Self-less

52,khunkrumark,Walk when Ben does!,3,31 August 2015,"Stick around for the first few minutes to watch a master class in acting from Ben Kingsley... When he leaves so should you.What could have been a brilliant 'Total Recall' type thriller is just another soap opera with blubbering women, needy kids and ridiculous car chases. It's horrible to watch.But the single biggest gaff in this celluloid effluence is the fact that the ruthless businessman (Kingsley) suffers a massive personality transplant after his 'shedding' and turns into a touchy-feely pansy.The second biggest (and even more painful to watch) gaff is hiring a child who can't act. Yeah, sorry kid... you ain't gonna make it in the talkies. But the best line in the movie happens about eight minutes in when the old dying Kingsley is trying to make a connection with his daughter who runs some kind of NGO in the city.""This isn't work. It's a bunch of children throwing a tantrum!""Just brilliant... and so true!Three stars out of ten... all three for Ben Kingsley.",Self-less
53,ArchonCinemaReviews,"Wanted to like it more than I did, but good sci-fi film nonetheless",7,4 September 2015,"Science fiction films delve into similar realms of thought, one of which is the lust for immortal life. Self/less starts as an interesting narrative of one rich man's search for more years, but it dissolves into a generic thriller as quickly as it gains momentum.Damian is a rich man, a real estate mogul, quickly dying painfully of cancer. Reaching the final days of his life, he reflects upon his mistakes during his life and yearns for more time. Lucky, new and innovative research is available for those who can afford it, in which your consciousness can be transferred into a healthy young body.Self/less is a movie about a desperate and sad man, a man with a vast quantity of wealth in the form of monetary gain but for which family and friends has been sacrificed. With age comes a shift in perspective, and with his imminent mortality approaching at a rapidly increasing speed, he grapples with the inevitable loss he is about to experience in dying. Unable to accept the natural order of things and right the wrongs of his life, he pays for the chance at more time, regardless of the consequences.The concept for Self/less is intriguing enough, even if it is not completely original. Once old Damian, played by Ben Kingsley, becomes young Damian, Ryan Reynolds, there are many paths in which the story can move. Unfortunately, the film chooses the most obvious path and therefore avoiding the possibility of wowing audiences. It just does its best job at imitating the tropes common within action flicks.Those hoping for a different version of Limitless will be mistaken, as Self/less is not that type of movie. Nor is it a deep philosophical examination of the meaning of life and death. The subject matter of the film itself may spur within your an interesting discussion, but Self/less does not take the initiative itself.Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases.",Self-less
54,ethanbresnett,Just didn't quite do it for me,6,19 January 2021,"There's a lot to like about Self/less. I think it has a very intriguing and well thought out plot, which is crucial for a film like this. You also can't go wrong with Ryan Reynolds. He's such a good leading man and is so watchable, transforming pretty much any film he's in. The rest of the cast were also great, with a shout out to Matthew Goode playing his sinister role to perfection.What I think its main failing is though is its pace. This film seemed to really drag. I'd seen the trailer and as a result knew exactly where this film was headed, and it took a long time to get there. As a result I found that the first 45 minutes or so dragged, and then once things did start to pick up we fell into a slump before the final act. It felt a lot longer than the two hour runtime. This is a pretty cardinal sin in my book.Aside from this I actually quite liked the film. The characters were interesting, the plot entertaining, and the action well executed.It won't blow you away, and is kind of a middle of the road forgettable film, but is certainly entertaining enough.",Self-less

It's pretty good, but just not good enough to be great. It has a really low score (in the 30's) on Metacritic, so I kind of expected it to be bad. It is not that bad at all, though. It has a higher score here on IMDb, which shows that sometimes professional critics are a little too stuck up. Anyway.First off, the action is really good. There's some fighting, and some shooting, and it is well executed, well directed. The fights in particular, not a lot of fighting here, but the choreography is great. The story is a little bit of a mystery and is interesting enough. They probably could have done more with it, but hey. The movie could have been a little shorter, a little tighter. I'm a big Ryan Reynolds fan, so naturally I enjoyed it more just because of him. He plays a bad ass, and I like bad asses.The movie is well shot, and has a couple of really cool single shots.

59,troyputland,Pretty average sci-fi...,6,8 September 2015,"A super rich real estate businessman by the name of Damian (Ben Kingsley) is dying. With a decent chunk of his money, Damian decides to transfer his consciousness to a new, younger body (Ryan Reynolds). There are side effects, really important ones that are kept secret until after the transition. The modern, healthier Damian erroneously bumps in to these well kept secrets, changing his whole view on life and death. Ben Kingsley, for the first quarter of Self/less, is first-class, unveiling Damian as a man with power and notoriety. When Reynolds enters the fray, his personality doesn't match, as if the two didn't taken the time to fit in the character's affinity. The story barely breaks the surface of a good idea. Asking the right questions, but not filling the answers. Matthew Goode's head scientist of the underground company feeds us this information. The action and the flow of the story are thrilling enough, but not to the point of caring for the lead.",Self-less
60,CountJonnie,"Decent actors, suffer under a terrible script",5,30 November 2018,"Ryan Reynolds and Ben Kingsley are two of the best actors with sometimes apalling roles and terrible acting. This is such a case, thanks to a terrible script.Ben Kingsley turns into a younger man, played by Ryan Reynolds, but discovers that the medical facility is nothing short of being a criminal organization. This could be interesting, if only the writers and director knew if this was a drama/mystery or an action movie.Partially the movie could be interesting, to see the conflict of a superficial Ben Kingsley and a caring/loving Ryan Reynolds. But this relationship, or even a battle within one mind, gets shoved away and replaced by mildly entertaining action scenes, terrible acting, plot holes, and a cardboard English villain. The sweet ending and action make this movie entertaining to a certain point, but that doesn't diminish the fact that it is a hollow movie, that fails to build on the relation between Kingsley and Reynolds that should have been there.",Self-less
61,jb_campo,cool movie,7,28 August 2016,"I really liked Self/less. The plot takes something from Criminal about mind transference, and gives it a unique twist. Ben Kingsley is Damian Hale, a super rich real estate mogul who is dying. He finds a card referring him to this service that can save him. As his condition worsens, he decides to shed his body with this service.There is an excellent sub plot of his poor relationship with his daughter Claire. He never gave her the time he should have when she was young, nor when she was old. He thought money bought everything, even love.Damian meets Albright who is in charge of the shedding process. After Damian wakes up, he's supposed to be in a clean, brand new body. He wakes up as Ed Kidner (played by Ryan Reynolds). Young, good looking, he needs to retrain his new body to walk. Once he gets things going, Kidner goes kind of crazy with his youth, powered by his mature brain. But he needs to take these red pills to keep from having episodes.Episodes have him hallucinating about things in the past, but they don't seem to be his past. Whose past is he hallucinating about then, since his body was biologically grown for him....or was it?Kidner/Damian starts having an internal battle as he discovers something about his true origin.That's about all that can be said without giving spoilers.I loved Ryan Reynolds who plays the cold, ruthless Damian, but starts inheriting traits he never knew he could have, and those traits give him the humanity he always wished he had, so that he could give that to his daughter Claire.In the end, it's a battle between money and love. There are plenty of chase scenes and an interesting sub plot with Victor Garber. The directors really do a nice job of tying what could have been an out of control story line into a nice, coherent plot. I kept wondering, what is Kidner going to do. Will he help Maddie (played by Natalie Martinez) and her daughter, or will he do what he really wants to do, or can he do both?There was plenty of suspense of bad guys vs good guys, Kidner against himself, Kidner against his friend, Kidner against Maddie, just so many interesting internal battles that make you keep wishing and rooting for the right things to happen.And again similar to Criminal, you root for the /bad/ guy to be good.Go see Self/Less, which was surprisingly good. At less than 2 hours, it is really a cool movie that flew under the radar. Enjoy.",Self-less

Self/Less isn't a movie where one would go out of their way to prove it's prowess, it's simply a movie where everyone played their part well, from Ryan, to Ben, to that little adorable ""Pumpkin', Anna... And the finished product was exactly that, finished.Jaynee-Lynne, the little girl who played Anna, was incredibly charming, and had a little attitude that was just so lovely to watch.Tarsem Singh did an appealing job, especially on a $26 million budget. The movie was clean, though at times a bit abrupt.The story was very, very easy to PREDICT... But again, still very ABLE, though perhaps, one could argue it being a tad pretentious, and being one of those premises, that had more depth than what was dug.Self/Less is an enjoyable, entertaining and well presented film.

I really don't. You give them a very good movie and they complain that it wasn't a lot better than it was. It's like they're going out of their way to be negative. That bothers me and that's why I prefer to call myself a movie ""reviewer"". I'm just someone who loves movies, sees a lot of them, knows a bit about the industry and wants to use my experience as a writer to discuss movies in a way that others might enjoy and find useful – and from a movie fan's perspective.I'm only out to answer one question when I review a movie: Was it entertaining? If I feel it was, I recommend it, giving it a grade in the ""A"" or ""B"" range, depending on how entertaining it was. If it's not very entertaining, or just bad, it gets a ""C"" or ""D"". And if the movie is out-right horrible, it gets an ""F"". Simple, right? Well, ""Self/less"" (PG-13, 1:56) isn't going to change the world, but it is interesting, fun, thought-provoking and well-made. It is, simply stated, a very entertaining film. What more do we need in a movie? Underneath all its action and intrigue, this movie asks how important a person's life is and at what cost a specific person's life should be preserved. Oscar winner Ben Kingsley plays Damian Hale, a New York City real estate tycoon who is dying of cancer. Like most people, Damian is more than a little unnerved by the reality of his imminent demise, but, unlike most people, he has the ability to do something about it. He becomes aware of a very expensive and very secretive process by which his consciousness can be implanted into a younger man's body, enabling Damian to survive, enjoy life and contribute to society for another 50 years or so. He's rich enough to afford it and arrogant enough to think he deserves it.Professor Albright (Matthew Goode) tells Damian that each body is an ""empty vessel"" grown in the lab. The body that Damian is given to inhabit looks a lot like Ryan Reynolds. The transition from his old body to his new body (called ""shedding"") is disorienting. Damian's mind has to get used to seeing a different reflection in the mirror and must learn to adjust to his new physicality. Albright puts him up in a luxury apartment near Albright's New Orleans facility in order to monitor the progress of Damian, Version 2.0. Albright also gives the new Damian red pills to help him suppress upsetting and reoccurring visions. Albright calls them ""hallucinations"" and says that they're a common side effect of the shedding process, but Damian says the visions feel more like memories. Hmmm.As the story unfolds, Damian learns to make new friends, but keep the old. In his temporary digs in the Big Easy, he starts hanging out with a guy named Anton (Derek Luke). Damian also gets reacquainted with two very different women from his past (played by Michelle Dockery and Natalie Martinez) and has to reach out to an old friend and colleague (Victor Garber) when things get complicated. A sci-fi drama becomes a mystery, a psychological thriller and an action movie with several twists and turns. ""Self/less"" is part ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", part ""The Bourne Identity"" and a little bit of ""The Matrix"". There's a lot going on to keep you entertained while you're thinking deep thoughts about the story's bigger issues.Some critics fault ""Self/less"" for becoming too much of an action movie and failing to more fully exploit the plot's intriguing set-up. But I have a feeling that if they got the movie they say they wanted, they'd have called it boring. This is an original, exciting film that is very well-acted, well-paced (by director Tarsem Singh) and well-plotted (by screenwriters David and Alex Pastor). The moral issues are never far from the moviegoers mind, and are still there to be considered after some of the movie's more frenetic moments have faded from the screen. A movie doesn't have to be completely original to be thought-provoking and entertaining. ""Self/less"" is both – and more. ""A-""",Self-less

68,abouhelier-r,Self/less,7,31 July 2015,"A dying real estate mogul transfers his consciousness into a healthy young body, but soon finds that neither the procedure nor the company that performed it are quite what they seem. This movie suggests plenty of questions about the nature of identity, the morality of scientific exploration and the price of ageing. However the script doesn't craft characters complicated enough to engage in those concept. It also appears as a parabole about man's lust fr immortality. Surprisingly though the movie doesn't explore the psychological consequences of becoming a new person. When it comes to performances: Ben Kingsley is great, you bought Gandhi and the Mandarin, you'll like him as Damian. Ryan Reynolds seems a little lost and far too decent to be the cold blooded capitalist Kingsley plays in the film early scenes. He is good though, I've always liked Ryan Reynolds, this man is a movie star! He got some pretty bad roles, especially with Green Lantern, but that's not his fault! Matthew Goode is particularly effective as well. As the sinister scientist he gives a solid performance. I mostly liked the movie. Its greatest crime is that it's not enough of anything. Not brainy enough to party with the theories about consciousness that Ex Machina delivered earlier this year, nor is it over the top enough to party with the campy goofballery of something like Limitless. The film little by little drops its high sci-fi concept facade for a more conventional pursuit thriller, before transforming yet again into a father-daughter bonding drama. Moreover, the more the narrative straightens out into a series of shootouts, punch outs and car chases, the more monotonous it becomes. In the end, the visual flairs with which the director tells this story balances the fact that the plot gets a little silly, a little ridiculous or completely off tracks. He knew how to keep the audiences engaged with a fast pace, so that you don't have the time to think too much about things that don't make any sense or convenient plot twists. Overall Self/less is a fun movie to watch, not a great one. This film is at its worst a cool 90's sci-fi action movie and at its best, it makes you question yourself on whether if you could live forever will you feel bad about who was the person you're inhabiting the body?",Self-less
69,stephendaxter,An incredibly interesting premise that fails to deliver,4,31 August 2015,"Self/Less is a sci-fi thriller that i was really looking forward to seeing for two reasons, one being that i usually like Ryan Reynolds work, 'usually'..... and the main reason being that this film had an incredible interesting premise with a lot of potential. Unfortunately for the film it got this very smart and interesting idea that could have made for a very entertaining sci-fi film and took it in entirely the wrong direction. There were so many cool things they could have done with the idea of being able to transfer your consciousness into a younger body to live longer but they turn away from all good opportunities in favour of a dull plot and uninteresting action scenes. I was completely invested in the first 20-25 minutes of this movie, it had all of the sci-fi elements i wanted to see and looked like it was setting itself up to be great. But then it completely dropped almost all those sci-fi elements and became a generic action film / escort plot that has been done so many times before. There was a very interesting direction taken with one of the side characters that was exactly what i wanted to see happen with the protagonist, it would have made for some awesome scenes if only they went in that direction. I won't say what it is for that delves into spoiler territory. One thing i have enjoyed about 'most' Ryan Reynolds movies is that there is a bit of fun in the film, some lighthearted moments and he has usually been pretty good at bringing those moments into his films. But this film had none of that and it desperately needed it. It took itself so seriously and you are dealing with a concept that is extremely unrealistic so having a bit of fun with it would have kept people engaged. The dull tones just make the movie feel very very long and it probably was almost 20 minutes too long on top of that. They dropped the ball early on by ditching the sci-fi elements then they just went and lost the ball completely with a ridiculous finale set-piece and a predictable ending i saw from a mile away.But not everything about the film the film was bad. As well as the first 20-25 minutes i thought Ryan Reynolds, Natalie Martinez, and Matthew Goode were just good in their roles. Nothing too spectacular and new from them but they were pretty bearable for most of the movie. Reynolds did a good job i thought at channeling his character although i couldn't see any resemblance between the personality he had and the one Ben Kingsley had. Being the same person they should have the same personality but i didn't see that, they came across as almost completely different people. But that was just a minor thing. Natalie's character also does have a few brain fades and becomes a damsel in distress but that is of course the writers fault. So this film was poised to be one of the better sci-fi thrillers of the year an until 25 minutes in i was convinced that it was going to be. But it dropped the ball and turned into a boring action film with a lifeless plot and terribly predictable finale. The 'good' performances give the film a bit of merit but not enough to save it, maybe if they used Ben Kingsley some more that could have bumped it up a little bit, but they didn't. So..... that was severely underwhelming...... If you are looking for a good sci-fi film, check out 'Ex Machina' instead - 4.3/10",Self-less

That is not to say we did not suspend belief as is the case with many of our best action/Sci-Fi films. A major section of the film, with some of its best action sequences, reminded me of my favorite scenes in Bourne Legacy. With all the above said there was yet room for disturbed, romantic relationships and one cute kid spitting out all her needed lines. Production value gives us some fun shots of New Orleans, area mansions and a finale 'home' in a spectacular locale.There have been so many mind invasion/transfer films that our expectations for something original with thrills, excitement and pathos were low.

So he must be in it for the money. But if money is his motivation, then why not patent and/or sell the invention - how much would IBM or NASA pay for a machine that transfers consciousness?

The business man neglecting his daughter felt very relatable and so was Ryan Reynold's character in an attempt to save his daughter who otherwise would die because of her illness.There are numerous surprises in this film and besides the thriller aspect you get just enough sci-fi and more than enough action.The supporting cast did an excellent job and I especially liked the little girl because I thought she acted really natural.The scale of it all sometimes feels a little small but it was still sufficient and probably caused by a lack of budget.Two keywords come to mind for this and thats sacrifice and redemption.I liked it a lot and so I recommend you'll give it a try.Enjoy.",Self-less

82,vistheindian,Self/Less – Not flaw/less,6,24 July 2015,"Quickie Review:Damian (Ben Kingsley), dying from cancer uses his vast resource of wealth to go through a medical procedure to transfer his consciousness to a younger and healthier body. While the initial thrill of being young again excites him, he soon notices symptoms that make him question the origin of his new body. In his search for the truth behind the procedure, he is hunted down by the organisation behind it all. Self/Less has a premise that feels familiar but is still an interesting concept. Due to the familiarity there are no big surprises and the story is pretty much paint by the numbers action flick. However, as a whole Self/Less is still an enjoyable movie, albeit a tad too long.Full Review:Self/Less had barely any marketing where I live so I knew very little about the movie. Yet from what I saw, I was interested because it reminded me of an 90s type sci-fi action, similar to Arnold Schwarzenegger's Total Recall. A sci-fi plot just to give our hero enough motive for some action.The idea of transferring consciousness was the most intriguing part about the movie. Although this is quite a small movie in terms of scope, the ""science"" (don't want to risk pissing off a neurologist who might read this) of it was pretty well thought out. There are rules and limitations to how the procedure works and develops. The cast work pretty well together, their chemistry is believable in the circumstances they are placed. Matthew Goode as the villain was a great fit. He never pulls a punch or trigger, but you know he is dangerous and formidable. What director Tarsem Singh really did well was developing the motives for each of the characters. In fact, he spent so much time on the characters that I hesitate to call this movie a pure action.This brings me to the pitfalls of the movie, one of which was that the movie was too long. I liked characters and I appreciate the effort put into developing them. Nevertheless there are definitely numerous scenes that could've been trimmed and still hold that level of character development. Another missed opportunity was with the dual personality of the Ryan Reynold's character. He is a good actor but here it felt like he was just playing himself. At no point could I tell that's Ben Kingsley in Reynold's body. It would've been really interesting to have him portray two vastly different personalities.In the end, I was satisfied with the movie. Yes there are some story problems, but the cast chemistry and the sci-fi element will keep you interested in the movie. I wouldn't say you need to rush out to see it immediately, but it's a worthy lazy Sunday couch watch.",Self-less
83,boris_unanimate,Watch only if you like product placement and weak plots,4,14 September 2018,"Instead of listing all the reasons this movie could have been great - with a fantastic concept that was actually done and redone several times - I could only state that it is a 2-hour long movie with plenty of product placement, like Chevrolet, Nike AND New Balance sneakers (I thought it was odd I literally saw 2 different types of sneakers in two concurrent scenes), Apple, Panerai watches, Lamborghini, Powerade, Coca Cola, Dell, Google and JetBlue. This may be why the movie had a promising story, but was used to sell stuff most people can easily identify and their brains will then make the connection to buy it. Probably the worst takeaway is that Ryan Reynolds does NOT shine in this role. I figured he's best when he gets to play himself, and this was definitely not written for him, but since he sells tickets, he was cast in a role that requires much more depth than action acrobatics and crying on cue. If you want a better story, better visuals and a much better end, save yourself the 2 hours on Netflix and just watch the original Total Recall. The classics are still the best.",Self-less

85,Equalizer16,A good film with an interesting narrative but could be improved.,5,21 July 2015,"If I could live longer in a new body I would choose Tarsem Singh's body so I could improve this film. Self/less is the sf thriller of an elderly man who takes the chance to inherit a new body, but soon discovers the unfortunate history of his new body. Firstly, the trailer made the film look exciting, however my expectations were not completely met. Instead of turning into a deep psychological science fiction, the film turn into just an action packed. Granted I do think the action sequences were very enjoyable. Unfortunately I found very plain acting in the film, and especially due to the plot of the film, it was hard for me to see Ryan Reynolds as Ben Kingsley. On the other hand there are scenes where we see characters acting and here we see more emotional and better performances.As a narrative the film could be improved into more like the film shown in the trailers, and also more thought into the characters so we can be certain that Ryan Reynolds is being a different character. Still, I think the film is one to enjoy for all action and science fiction fans, and for fans of Ryan Reynolds. I give the film a 6/10.",Self-less
86,Field78,Inspiration/less,5,13 September 2018,"I am surprised to see that this dime-a-dozen movie is doing so well among IMDb users, whereas a movie like Cloverfield Paradox, which had its flaws but at least tried to be creative, gets razed to the ground. This movie has a strong premise and there were opportunities aplenty to do something nice with it, but these are sadly underused. Really, watching Self-less is almost like staring at a bulb that won't blossom for two hours.Terminally-ill billionaire Ben Kingsley has all the riches that he worked hard for, but he can barely connect with his daughter and no one is likely to miss him when he is gone. He gets the opportunity to extend his hollow life by transplanting his mind into a custom-made, lab-grown body. Waking up looking like Ryan Reynolds, he initially enjoys his newfound youth, until he starts to get more and more intrusive hallucinations that almost feel like old memories. I can stop here already, because everyone who has seen a few science-fiction movies can guess which direction this is going. This happens in the first 45 minutes, so if this was the only predictable part of the movie, it wouldn't have been so bad. But alas, the rest of the 'surprises' in the film can also be spotted from miles away. Even if the plot itself isn't quite revolutionary or complex, there can still be room to explore the ethical sides of the premise. Movies like Blade Runner became classics due to their subtext, symbolism and philosophical content. Unfortunately, plot usually isn't director Tarsem Singh's strongest point. All the opportunities to do something more with mind transfer, father-daughter issues, and the sacrifice of one human life over another are mainly used to further the undernourished plot, not to bring up a meaningful point. Now even within a formulaic movie that is basically a fill-in-the-blanks exercise, a director can still leave his or her mark with their unique style, whether in production design, photography, mis-en-scene etc. But worse than the lazy writing is that there are hardly any memorable scenes here. The action scenes are of the boring standard Hollywood fare, done without much creativity or inspiration, and only incidentally is there a nice gimmick or idea that works. Director Singh is known for his visual wizardly with which he was able to overcome the lack of strong plotting in films like The Cell, The Fall and Immortals, but somehow he wasn't allowed to bring his usual lush and vibrant style to the table here.Let's hope that Singh's next project will be something where he can release his visual creative energy, because wasting the talents of Michelle Dockery and sir Ben Kingsley without something beautiful to look at is not a good use of his and our time.",Self-less

I'll be the first to admit I think Claire was a huge brat for treating her father the way she did, but maybe that's just makes me superficial. either way, without that that treatment, he wouldn't have gone on to want a second chance and we wouldn't have gotten a beautiful love story about family, which is something else that i think sets this film apart from other films like it. does it finish with a clichéd redemption? of course, but this ride was a much more enjoyable one than other films of this genre i can think of.",Self-less
88,kdavies-69347,Lacking the beauty of Tarsem Singh's previous films.,5,18 November 2015,"Self/less is Tarsem Singh's take on the 'body switch' plot seen in some films in the recent decade. This is actually Ryan Reynolds second body swap flick, so it would be expected that he has some experience to bring to the film.I'm so used to Tarsem Singh's beautiful visual style, that I was surprised to see how plain the cinematography and scenery was for this film. I enjoyed so many of his previous titles and the way his stories unfold through the scenery and costumes and camera angles. But to be honest, this one felt a bit like a Sunday-night flick that you would pick up from the movie store when nothing better was available to take home.The story is fine, and progresses nicely throughout the film. It hits all the marks of a thriller, but that makes it relatively predictable. The story unfolds quite slowly at the beginning, and doesn't loan much screen-time to (arguably, since he's only in it for 15 minutes) the best actor in the film, Sir Ben Kingsley. Afterwards, it switches pace and goes for a little more of an action/thriller feel, and Tarsem Singh tries hard to maintain that feeling until the end. There were a couple of unresolved issues at the end... but I don't want to ruin it for anyone.The major issue I had with this film, is Ryan Reynolds inability to emote as Ben Kingsley's character; Damien. The two characters are so dissimilar, you would expect some of Damien's personality to retain in his new body. Sadly it was like watching Reynolds trying to be only slightly less sassy than usual for most of his films. He always has this sarcastic attitude that I find quite the opposite of Ben Kingsley's character, who is much more dark, ruthless, and driven. I know that's comparing apples and oranges, however, even though they are both are fruits they have very different tastes.Sadly, the body swap plot line didn't really bring anything new to cinema, and it was a little bit lackluster in comparison to Tarsem Singh's previous works. I appreciate his effort however.5.5/10",Self-less
89,theemuhammede,"Slow beginning, better ending",6,13 May 2016,"This movie has a different look at creating life by continuing existing ones. The beginning of the movie was extremely slow and boring. There was not that much interest put into it. Once it was discovered where the new host bodies were coming from, the movie became much more interesting and entertaining.Death is inevitable. But to some, it is avoidable. In this movie, a new scientific method was developed to transfer one's mind and conscious to another healthy body. Essentially, this is a way to become immortal. It was a cool concept, and it was unlike any other.Ryan Reynolds plays the role of the younger Damian. Damian is a billionaire industrialist who was dying from sickness and old age. So he was transferred into the younger and much more healthier body in order to continue his legacy. But the younger Damian would have to take pills in order to keep his old mind in sync with his new body. If he did not take the pills, then he would suffer the side effects. What was unknown to him before the operation was the side effects. The younger host bodies were said to be designed and built in test tubes. But they were not. They were from actual human beings as well that had previously died. If Damian did not take the pills, then the mind of the young person's body would begin to take over, and Damian would soon be dead.A slow beginning, but the middle and ending make up for it. It has a cool twist to it, and it gives the viewer a different look at life and immortality.",Self-less

91,brutzel,Great Sci-Fi Story,9,31 December 2015,"At 68-years of age, ultra wealthy Damien (Ben Kingsley) is dying of Cancer and wants to undergo a radical procedure that will transfer his mind into a healthy man. He is told the body he will go into was formed in the laboratory thanks to scientific advances. He awakens as Edward (Ryan Reynolds) and must take a certain pill to prolong this new life. Later he has flashes of memories he knew he never had and upon further investigation he learns he was lied to. Ah, now the story begins. This sounds simple enough but as the story progresses it can become complicated. It's almost like those time travel stories with different time-line realities that no one can follow. But stay with it as it is easy to understand providing you pay attention. This is some Sci-Fi story. This is one for the books and I'm sure we'll see copycats down the road. The acting by all is first class. A special shout-out must go to Matthew Goode as Albright the one in charge of the transfer modification advertised as Shedding. (like a snake?) He nails the Albright character. Kudos. Also this may be one of the best performances by Ryan Reynolds. Victor Garber as Martin, also ultra wealthy and a longtime and trusted friend of Damien, is also a major factor in here and when you see him at his multi-million dollar home you will be acquainted with a twist you didn't see coming.

The next reveal establishes the big challenge. The main character will have to make a choice that will end badly for someone. Technology creating problems is good sci-fi.I also noticed the similarities to the 1960's movie. I hate the idea of accusing someone of theft just because they reuse something from an earlier movie. Sorry, no more time travel, westerns, crime shows, or rom com movies because it's been done before. This is how genres get established. This one had meaningful differences from the other movie. Naming them would reveal too many spoilers, but here is one, the 60's movie uses the same body to give him a new identity but only changes his appearance, this one gives him a new body.

This pales in comparison to ""Seconds,"" but it does make good use of scenic locations and offers decent work from a good cast, especially from the always reliable Victor Garber. Ryan Reynolds is subdued but effective, as is the direction, which doesn't go as overboard on visual flourishes as Singh has in some past work. The story and screenplay are intriguing and competent enough, though the film has a few too many twists for its own good and could have benefited from a judicious trim of 15 minutes or so off its run-time.

94,keithlovesmovies,Self/less Review,6,11 July 2015,"Billionaire Damian Hale (Ben Kingsley) is on top of the world until he runs into a problem he can't solve, Cancer. His only hope is a new medical procedure called ""shedding,"" in which his consciousness is transferred to a healthy body. After Damian undergoes this procedure, he becomes a man named Edward (Ryan Reynolds). Once he attempts to start a new life in New Orleans, he starts to become ravaged by visions of his new body's past. As he begins to investigate the origin of his new body, he learns the lengths that his creators will take to protect their procedure and keep their identities secret.The film, I will admit, introduces an original concept that not many films have covered. It's a shame that it does not stay with it for very long. We start off with older Damian coming to terms with where he is in his life and with his condition and then the film pivots to more of an action film as younger Damian/Edward investigates his roots through his visions and survive its resistance. It was a shame that more time wasn't spent with the older version of Damian. This loss created a void in the story. It would have been better if we could have spent more time with him so his character could be more developed. From the little we got to see, he appears to not be that great of a person. If we knew more, we would have reason to root for him. The time spent during an unnecessary sequence in the middle could have helped with that. There is a lack of consistency in the character of Damian as well. The character is played by 2 different actors but their performances are not the same. There seems to not be any apparent, similar, alignment in mannerisms between the two Damians, they don't act too similarly either. That could either be because of writing, Ryan Reynolds' performance, and/or not too careful direction. The film had the chance to try to answer some philosophical questions relating to the value of human life or the morality of valuing a life over. When you start to wonder if this whole ""shedding"" procedure is even possible, you are forced to accept that it is. Instead of being about Damian coming to terms with his new body and life, it chooses the path of gun fights and car chases. This is the moment when the film falls into the realm of mediocrity. It isn't revolutionary. The twists will not come as much of a surprise either. The film managed to keep my attention but I would of preferred it to cover more of the philosophical issues relating to the procedure. The film has a good idea but it could have been portrayed in a different/better way.",Self-less
95,russellingreviews,Suffering from an identity crisis,5,13 July 2015,"If you had enough money to buy immortality, would you do it? Walking into the cinema... Can we gain immortality? The age old question of seeking after more to the life we have been given. Self/less seems to look at what we gain and what we lose by seeking after eternal life. Overall Rating: 2.25 stars Cinematic rating: 2 stars Bigger questions rating: 2.75 stars Most may never have enough money to consider the probability of this eternal conundrum, but in the life of Damian Hale (Ben Kingsley), it is a possibility. He is a billionaire dying of cancer and thinks he deserves a longer life. He takes on the mortality gamble through a questionable procedure developed by Dr. Albright. The procedure that will end his life, but place his soul into a new and improved body. After his death, he wakes up as a younger man (Ryan Reynolds), but soon realises that there are some issues. Damian has visions that seem to imply that the body he is inhabiting may have been used before. As Damian asks for clarification from Dr. Albright and his organisation, they begin to challenge his decisions and manipulate his new existence. With this comes the awareness of the man's previous ego and his life attempting to take over. Both of the men who indwell the same body have to come to terms with the sacrifices that they both must make for the sake of living this new life.If the film's description sounds convoluted, the viewing experience twists and turns beyond comprehension. Self/less looks like a fresh spin on the fountain of youth narrative, but suffers from an identity crisis. Kingsley is convincing as the vicious building mogul of New York, Reynolds fills the predictable comic-charmer and Matthew Goode is perfect as Albright, the insidious mad scientist. It has the right players in place for Tarsem Singh's (Mirror Mirror, Immortals) story, but struggles with identifying what genre to travel in this cinematic journey. Singh seems to struggle with the same multi-personality crisis of his central characters. It starts off as a contemplative quest then moves to family drama then becomes a Bourne-like action adventure. Then it tries to go back and forth between each genre, but is unsuccessful in delivering a satisfactory result. Each of the potential story lines has appealing elements that would have made for fascinating considerations, but as a mix they develop a schizophrenic experience. The existential wrestling match is not new. The rich buying eternal life. From Heaven Can Wait to Vanilla Sky to In Time, this proposition has been part of cinema. There are urban legends of the rich striving for similar immortal opportunities in the real world. Yet, for it to work on the silver screen, the story does not have to be believable, but it does need to be probable. The audience has to consider if the experiment could potentially work if people are given enough money and find the right technology. It has worked in other films, but the disjointed feel of Self/less undermines the probability of this consideration. In the end, this is a story that was meant to be about acquiring eternal life, but ultimately is dead on arrival. Even with it's failings, Self/less does redeem itself through the range of topics to consider about the human experience. From the opening scene, it represented a journey through an Ecclesiastes-type existence. 'Vanity, vanity' pours forth from Damien Hale's life. Showing that money can provide all the world has to offer, even the unbelievable, but mankind cannot find all it needs from life in mere material things. As both men go through the process of finding out what is important in their lives or life and they are confronted with an overarching theme of the ultimate sacrifice. Specifically, both central characters have to come to a point of how far would they go to sacrifice their life. Even though the Self/less storyline had an identity crisis, it does manage to touch on some of humanities deepest queries. What it lacks in entertainment value, it does offer in engaging discussion points.Leaving the cinema... Self/less has all of the elements for a super-charged experience, but proves to be in a cinematic coma.Reel Dialogue: What are some of the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. What does the Bible have to say about sacrifice? (Roman 5:8, Romans 12:1-2) 2. Can we find true redemption in this life? (Romans 3:24-26, Ephesians 1:7) 3. What does this life have to offer?

Raises many interesting philosophical and ethical issues on the problem of transferring consciousness from one body to another, some of which may be of particular interest to adherents of Transhumanism, a movement which pushes for the extension of life through any possible/available means. Consciousness and Identity, Mind & Body Problem, Ego and Id, all relevant philosophical problems related to the issues raised, with moral side overtones and whistles from merging consciousness from (at least) two different people. The issue is quite complex and this movie presents some of the ethical problems raised. Falls a little heavy on the obligatory part that tries to justify a prior good moral code, but still quite successful in delivering a powerful interpretation of what a possible solution to the problem of death might entail. Nice plot, action, visuals, not too much tangential over runs, complicated twists and the obligatory Evil Scientist, who operates without any moral restraints whatsoever. Like others have pointed out, a mix between Limitless and Face On/Off, but more philosophically involved. Too bad only because the actual procedure used is pure fiction; such tech is unheard of.

Bottom line, it tells the right story the right way, and Ryan Reynolds doesn't skip a beat as the lead. He connects effortlessly at the deepest human levels, and is able to create characters that you care about. As Reynolds' characterization evolves, it gets really, really interesting, and I think the story will stay with you long after your screen has gone dark. Most current science fiction isn't really about what an alternative future might look like - -- or feel like. That is, genres such as action, battle and horror are passed off as scifi, but actually aren't. Despite a few gaps in the setup, this movie ultimately succeeds.

104,Allen_The-Shep_Shepherd,Self/less Review,5,10 July 2015,"My Thoughts:There are movies that you see the trailer for and think to yourself that is a very interesting concept I wonder if they will delve into the deeper aspects of this and then you get to the movie and go nope not even close. Self/less is a movie that I wanted them to delve deeper into the struggles inside and outside of taking over a new body.We get a very little taste of that with memories that seem to force themselves on the new ""person"" taking over the body but they really side step all that with magic red pills that they seemed to have developed before knowing really that they would need them. So you really do not get a struggle for control because if you continue to take your little red pills then the memories will dissipate. The only reason this is an issue in this movie is because the company doesn't bother telling the people that they are moving into the new body that they body really isn't brand new but slightly used. And that brings me to the outside portion of the struggle I wanted them to show more.The company that does this ""shedding"" as it is called in the movie first lie and state that the bodies were grown in a lab but we come to find out that that isn't really true they had issues with the growth process. Instead of being up front and telling the new owners that the body they are purchasing was used but the previous owner gave up all rights to the body due to ""x"" circumstance they throw the new person into the body and then try to lie once again about the memories they are seeing and that take these little red pills and they will go away.Usually when I watch a movie even when I think it is bad I can usually find something good about at least a portion of it. This one I can't even say is a good popcorn movie. There are too many movies out during blockbuster season that I would recommend over this movie, maybe if it came out in the January through April time frame I could give my recommendation to check this movie out in the theaters but I can't do that now. With the three movies that are coming out today if you had to see one in theaters it would have to be Minions at least you would be entertained.So let me ask you if you were dying and a company came up to you and said they could extend your life and were completely honest about the procedure, would you go for it?My Recommendation:Rent It",Self-less

The ending... when Damian basically commits suicide by giving Mark back his body and in doing so allowing his own personality to be kicked out and ""killed"". I know it was the 'good' thing to do, but personally if I was in his shoes I would have stayed the course of the pills and fully repressed and got rid of marks personality and then lived out my life with Madeleine and Anna. I know this seems cruel but like Madeleine would have ended up falling in love with Damian since his in her husbands body and he could have raised Anna as he never got the chance to do with his own biological daughter.Anyway because of the ending I give the movie a 8 instead of 10 out of 10.

OK, let's say I paid 50 cents.Sadly, this mess still isn't worth it. And that's too bad because Ben Kingsley always gives a good performance; Ryan Reynolds is quite capable and Tarsem Singh is one of the most visionary directors working today (see his movie, The Fall and his TV show, Emerald City). But as some reviewers have already noted: this sci-fi thriller is not good enough in either department to warrant a recommendation. In fact, it lacks sorely in both so much that it becomes a chore to watch. The science part is silly, which is OK. Good premise fiction is based on some breakthrough with all follow on action required to observe that new reality. But the secretiveness of this bio technology is never explained, especially when anyone can Google it and go right to video explanations and even the creator's house. Plus, what bio-tech firm hires heavily armed henchmen? And why? This is one of many head-scratching details that is never explained.Of course, the ruthless henchmen help propel the action. But as noted above, the thriller part is woefully lacking in excitement. Despite Singh's directorial talents, these all-too familiar shoot and chase, ad nausea scenes inspire yawns instead of tension. In short, there's nothing here to think about, be excited about or care about.",Self-less

108,sean-curtin-517-748378,Self /Less or Time / Less,10,3 December 2015,"Possible Spoiler warning: Do not read this review if you haven't seen the movie yet.There seems to be a handful of people who just can't handle any idea if it even slightly resembles something that has been done before. In this case, I guess you can compare Self/ Less with the Philip K Dick masterpiece 'Total Recall'.For this reviewer, what made this idea on the concept of immortality unique was the fact that it was produced to give a concept which could be possible now.There's a lot of people who love the done to death 'Vampire' concept for example, well Self / Less is a movie about achieving immortality to, however in the case of Self / Less the concept is even more sinister. With the Vampire concept, victims of the vampire feeding can end up immortal but they still have the same personality and memories.In Self / Less the concept is thrown out the window. It's an excursion into the dark world of organ harvesting on the black market if you will, with the ultimate issue being that instead of just organs, where talking about whole bodies. Black market organ harvesting happens today in our time, so the concept for Self / Less was worthwhile.There are also some reviewers who have been declaring 'plot holes' but I would argue they are mistaken. For example if you woke up with a new body, but the memories from the person who previously inhabited said body where still in there and you had to take drugs to suppress them, that would without doubt change you. The feeling and caring is justified in the Ben Kingsley's character as he feels guilt for the time he didn't spend with his daughter and instead used his time to build a multi-billion dollar empire. Like many people he believed money was the answer to everything. Towards his last days in his old body, it's clear from Ben Kingsley's acting that he realises money isn't everything. He tries to make a peace with his daughter who hates him and wants nothing to do with his money as she doesn't want to become an unfeeling business only kind of person like him. Seeing the younger daughter in his new body and spending time with her makes him realise how much he's missed.All his life, he's used the simply analogy that it's 'only business and good business' to justify his greed, wealth and power. In reality it's become nothing more than a barrier between his self and his family.The movie was a terrific venture into exploring the psychological impacts of realisation and walking in the shoes of someone else for a time. He may seem uncaring but even he sees the wrong in taking away a families father figure.The movie certainly places the 'science' into science fiction. The scientist who creates the technique to allow the transfer of a persons memories into another mind, is in a lot of ways like the character played by Ben Kingsley, he's justifying what he does by showering others with money to make up for the loss of there loved ones. He believes that great minds should live on, while others are irrelevant. An obvious error, but one which makes his character strangely caring while at the same time a narcissistic psychopath.Overall, the Scientist (played by Mathew Goode) was my favorite character in the movie. His acting was terrific and he carried the mannerism of the Scientist (played by Thomas Francis Murphy) really well.Ben Kingsley was as terrific as always and it would have been nice to see a bit more of him playing the original character.This movie had a lot of action scenes and I think that's the only negative I have, with the whole movie. I enjoyed most of the scenes but I felt that the movie would have been even better, had they simply taken on more drama and character interactions instead. For a story of this complexity, this would have made a lot more sense and the movie would have been enriched because of it.It's certainly a worthwhile movie and while I actually believe it scores a fair 8/10, I'm giving it a 10 because I believe it's received some rather harsh and unjustified reviews from people who automatically declared this movie a copy without considering that it's actually a scary possible idea right now. It's nothing like Face / Off because that was a complete face swap, not a memory swap. It's not the same as Total Recall, because this is a complete mind transfer, not a memory implant. It also had the great concept of adding adverse side effects which as the scientist declares is a reality similar to organ transplants.It showed a lot of great moments and it's certainly worth watching at least once. The action scenes seemed to be geared purely to look amazing on a large screen but there were too many of them for a story like this.For those like myself who enjoyed the movie, I would recommend the movie 'Puzzlehead'. Which I think you might enjoy.To conclude, a great story, let down slightly by a lot of unnecessary action scenes. The movie already had a great story that could have been explored properly instead of having to add the silly fast paced action scenes just to appeal to some audiences who can't still unless there's action and explosion to keep there eyes glued to the screen. Science Fiction films should always be thought provoking. There are many Sci-Fi's that do not have an explosion or action scene every 5 minutes and are all the better because of it.",Self-less

Plays a very good protagonist whose cause / journey you can root for. He also has good chemistry with some of the characters. Ben Kinglsey, despite limited screentime, is great.Try not to listen to the negative reviews. But also try not to have great expectations, as this movie doesn't aim to be great.

When Ben Kingsley visits Matthew Goode, he explains that he hasn't got long to live, while Goode suggests that he could apart of his new experiment. Kingsley transports his soul inside Reynolds dead body, and becomes that person, that person with the mind of his own.

This movie has action, suspense, surprise, excitement, drama and ORIGINALITY. I felt like the director needed to wring a little more out of the actors' performances, especially Ryan Reynolds. When ""Damian"" first figures out what has happened, I needed a little more emotion from him. That's the reason it gets a 9. Glad to see him in serious role like this though. I don't think I've ever seen such an exciting drama that was also so touching. The only film I can even compare this to is ""Extreme Measures"" and this is leaps and bounds better than that.

116,aegiswiz-accede,Tried and true on two fronts,7,1 January 2016,"This idea, contrary to some opinions is an old one. This one is exactly John Scalzi's, ""Old Man's War"" series idea but Ol' John Perry had no idea what he was in for. In this outing of the idea Damien Hale did know at least as much as the crippled Jake Sully in Avatar knew. Figure the dates..., and Avatar was probably ""influenced"" by Old Man's War. But it is a great idea, and folks can do a lot with it. This one is a tried and true ""character quest plot"" as well, which explaining creeps into the spoiler category if you don't already know what it is. If you do, you know those are usually great stories.To me it was predictable. Not the movies fault that I've read a lot. The plot has a couple ways to go. The way this one went is probably the most popular and well liked. I was a little surprised it wasn't ""more"". I think I just was not feeling the crash, bang, boom going on. I would have liked a little more getting in touch with the ""past training"". I think that would have sold me on the crash, bang, boom more convincingly.Don't misunderstand, it is a good movie. Ben Kingsley can do no wrong by me. Ryan Reynolds is working on getting there himself, and I have a spot in my heart for Natalie Martinez from the Under the Dome days. Sprinkle in some Victor Garber and you have a set of actors almost always worth watching. I enjoyed a couple of surprising plot point twists that I didn't see coming. Movie might be worth watching for those alone. It is great when a story surprises and that isn't an easy thing to sell to well conditioned entertainment consumers.To me it is 7 stars reaching for 8 and almost making it.

117,cammymadden,Didn't Live Up To It's Potential,5,28 October 2015,"I'm going to try my best to review this film without spoiling it for anyone who plans on watching it but just in case, please be aware that there could potentially be spoilers at some stage. Leading up to this film being released, I couldn't have been more excited. I recently studied psychology and sociology at university and have seen many different points of view regarding ""the self"" and just consciousness in general. So of course a film looking at the idea of transporting one's consciousness from one host body to another intrigued me greatly. Sadly, I have to say that this film seemed to focus on a lot of the wrong aspects, while avoiding the areas that could have made it great. What should have been a more scientific look at the idea of ""shedding"" became one big action sequence with explosions, flamethrowers and car chases. The occasional twist in the story line did not make up for the general lack of content. My issue with reviewing this film is that there is no stand-out reason as to what made this film (in my opinion) a 5 out of 10. Perhaps it was the lack of depth into the lives of ANY of the characters. We get a brief glimpse of Ben Kingsley's character and we are shown various aspects of his life which is meant to give us the overall impression that he spent his life making money instead of with his daughter. However, the lack of emotion in any of the scenes make it difficult to connect with his character. The constant ""montage-style"" sequences that we see of Ryan Reynolds after the shedding process mean that we also don't get a chance to see the initial difficulty he faces in this new body. I'm not sure if I would ever recommend this film to anyone and I can't imagine I'll watch it again anytime soon.",Self-less

But I do not want to bore anyone more than this movie would ( Hint hint!)First of all, the movie lacks major continuity. I know it is supposed to be a sci-fi so I do not expect real stuff in it, but come on! The movie first portraits the main character as vain, selfish, super rich. As the movie goes along, our character turns out to be super selfless and caring about some strange woman and child. Nothing happens in order to push this Damian to change. Basically he pays 250 million to transfer his mind in a younger body. When he finds out that the body belonged to a guy who sold it for millions of dollars, he feels bad and wants to ""return"" it. SERIOUSLY?? All that because the previous owner of the body had a wife and a daughter who by the way received all that fortune after his ""death"". The wife is played by a plain actress, does not inspire any feelings or emotions. She is supposed to be ""latina"", but her name Is Maddie. Also the whole movie she looks like a peasant's wife, with her simple messy braid. No, no, no ! The whole movie makes no sense and has a typical SUPER PREDICTABLE ending.

And there is a lot of plot lines that can branch out of it. And instead of a performance that unleashed Ryan Reynolds and allowed him to go thru a range of emotions, this turned into a mostly bland action movie. I will say the scene in the mansion with the child is incredible in showing another aspect to this procedure and its uses. The main antagonist has a twist that I saw coming, but it was enjoyable nonetheless. I wish this movie was a little less focused on the action and pushing plot lines when it could have taken moments to slow down and explore the less heroic side of Ben Kingsley's character (Inside Ryan Reynolds character). Before we see Kingsley's character transferred to Reynolds body, he shows a very aggressive and selfish side. I will say that I still think this a good movie.

I loved this premise and the production values were through the roof . . . up until Ben Kingsley's character transitions to Ryan Reynolds role. Yes, so his consciousness is transferred to a young healthy body but why is there not the slightest glimmer of his previous personality? Ben's character had a distinctive east coast accent, dressed exquisitely, was 68 years old and was of obvious refinement and so suddenly a new younger body means he is a totally different person complete with mad skills on the basketball court? It would seem that the director would have ensured that there was some shred of his previous persona in the Reynolds character - not just a vague ""do you know who I used to be"" line of dialog nod to that existence. That obvious lack of attention to detail was enough to keep me from watching past the cliché explosions and flamethrower ""escape from the farmhouse"" scene.

This is because existing reviews usually closely match my sentiments but in this case I feel compelled to warn Kingsley fans that he is not seen very much in this movie and those first 15 minutes in which we learn that shrewd real estate tycoon Damien Hale (Kingsley) is dying is the best part of the movie. The film goes down a lot with Ryan Reynolds playing the young Damien, a man who suddenly develops empathy and a host of other characteristics that don't represent any part of the Damien we were just watching a few minutes prior. Had there been a transition in the character brought on by living a new life, this movie would have been a lot better. Another thing that would make the movie better is if they had better casting for Maddie and Anna, two people in young Damien's new life. I won't share anything else as it may be considered a spoiler but all I can say is these two are barely tolerable in their roles.

133,Jazzy31133,"Great Premise, Failed Execution",5,10 December 2015,"I typically prefer to write reviews for movies that have less than 10 user reviews, so people can know what they are in for when deciding to spend their time and money on a less well known flick. I find user reviews infinitely more valuable and telling than so called ""professional critic reviews"". Users factor in the enjoyment experience much more accurately than the pros. In fact I am surprised pro critics even exist with the power of the internet to unite users. Self/less was a wide release and has many reviews, but I decided to write a review because I felt misled by my fellow users and their suggestions to overlook the low rating and give the movie a watch.When a trailer does not excite me, it is always a red flag. How can you not make any movie look exciting in two minutes? I'm always flabbergasted at poor trailers. I can recall seeing many great trailers for poorly executed movies, so I'm always surprised when a trailer is failure and when I saw the trailer for this movie I felt as if it was boring summary of the movie. I immediately flagged this as a pass.A few days ago I was reading the list of scripts on the black list and came across this title. The original script must have been terrific. Then I thought Ben Kingsley is in it so maybe it has some value. And after reading user reviews like give it a chance, great premise and ignore the low rating - I said why not.I am very patient with movies and always try to give the benefit of the doubt, even if I don't fully understand what the director was trying to do. But man did this movie disappoint. I am very surprised at the user comments. I thought Ben did a great job, but he has a very minor part. Ryan does not seem enthusiastic about the role he is cast in. You know he doesn't need the money, so maybe the script really was great and the director fumbled it. Or maybe Ryan is going through movie fatigue. He seems to be in quite a few these days. Maybe it is time he started being more selective.I think I may have gone off on a slight tangent, but I want someone who decides to spend his time and money on this to know what to expect. The premise is unique, but the movie stumbles in execution and the performances. The set pieces are not even that great. If you are going to have lethargic performances and boring, low stakes action at least have awesome fight scenes. This would be a pass for me. Not even an attempt at a crazy plot twist. Very straightforward. Instead, read the wiki plot review if you are curious about the movie's story. But I bet you will guess the obvious, unsatisfactory ending after the first few lines.",Self-less

A futuristic sci fi thriller.... Ryan Renolds who wasn't terrible in the ""Woman in Gold"" with Helen Mirren as a supporting actor. Director of the Cell and other heavy visual style. A budget of $26millin not too shabby. What could go wrong? A lot it seems, what had such great potential quickly turned into a B movie.The beginning wasn't that terrible actually, Ben Kingsley did a great job as always with what he had. The biggest problem with this movie is the directing by far! Some casting mistakes were made. There was tons of cheesy dialogue. The wife was quite the miscast as well, there was little chemistry between Ryan Renolds and his ""wife"", and felt like acting. In fact this was one of the worst performances I've seen from Ryan Renolds. In a stronger directors hands with better music and visual work, it would have detracted a bit and pushed the experience higher. There was little suspense and thriller within the movie, I just couldn't wait for it to end. This could have been sooo much better in a hands of a stronger director even with the poor acting.A waste of time in the end, there are better movies out there. If it wasn't for Ben Kingley I would give this movie 1 star, but he kept it engaging and interesting the first 15min.Anyway you have been warned, if you want to watch a poor rehash with bad acting and full of plot holes go for it.

136,Ianmcane,A Superior Sci-Fi Action Thriller,9,27 September 2021,"I'm quite surprised at the fairly average rating this has, I really don't understand what there is to dislike about this film. Firstly, they played it serious, which was a massive and much-welcomed surprise, as I went into this with pretty low expectations, anticipating hammy, over-the-top 'Face/Off' sort of fare. Well, this certainly subverted my expectations. Sure, the core concept was never really explained 'scientifically' but does it really need to be? This is science fiction!!What I loved about this film was that all the reactions, emotions and interactions seemed plausible and believable. Characters acted like real people and the two leads did a fabulous job, in particular the increasingly-impressive Ryan Reynolds who seems to be maturing into a fine actor.Another thing that impressed me was the terrific action, which was skilfully delivered with a keen attention to detail. It's the little things that catch my attention sometimes, such as the gun falling from Ryan Reynolds' character's hand during a shootout, rendering him almost defenceless. Also in the same scene where he rammed a car and their bumpers got jammed together, therefore creating a new and unexpected problem. It really elevates a film when you can clearly see that the filmmakers have thought through these details. Massive credit to the director whom I wasn't familiar with before this.Anyway I don't want to spoil this too much, I highly recommend it and although it did drag a tiny bit towards the final act it rewards the viewer with a satisfying emotional pay-off which was genuinely affecting.9/10 for me and a deserving entry into the archive of intelligent, thoughtful Sci-Fi.",Self-less

I'm glad I watched it, because the premise is intriguing, and well carried out. It has all the angst of a confused character, and yet we know (to a degree) what's going on. Ryan Reynolds (Damian) does a good job, and his character is likable throughout.Damian Hale is a very rich, but dying man. He arranges to ""shed"" himself into the body of a younger man, whom he is told was grown in the lab. Upon revival, he is given medication, a new identity, a new life. He makes friends, sticks to a routine, but there are episodes -- brought on by the shedding -- which complicate the new life he has.Some things just don't add up, and he sets out to investigate -- and pretty soon ends up running for his life.I would watch the movie again without hesitation.",Self-less

Hated his wife Maddie - she ruined the film,6,29 August 2015,"Nothing is new under the sun and this is similar to ""Freaky Friday"" and all those other body snatcher films. It was, however, really creatively done. However I find Ben Kingsley character to be quite unrealistic being that he was so infatuated with that annoying irritating women Maddie., She was so irritating and annoying, she almost ruined the film. The daughter was cute and I totally felt for the other characters. But I cannot stand Maddie and she was in so many scenes being so irritating and annoying, I really wish he was able to body snatcher his old dying wife into Maddie's body. And the fact that Ben Kingsley was so enthralled with how inhumane someone's FREE WILL to die for insurance money to save their little girl that he went on a killing spree to stop it at all costs That was very SELFISH of HIM!!!This film gets the score 6 ONLY b/c I love sci-fi and fantasy films which this film was creative and sci-fi.",Self-less
141,dave-70421,Great and often emotional action film,8,20 January 2017,"I have to completely echo what has been said, just what on earth do so called ""professional"" or ""expert"" reviewers expect from a film like this to rate it so bad and moan how it could be so much better etc?. This is a classic and possibly the best example I've seen to say and indicate that we should ignore and disregard the so called ""professional"" or ""expert"" reviewers and put more weight onto what the general public movie fans say instead.For me this is probably the best film I've sen in the last year and I've seen loads. And certainly the biggest difference between what so called ""experts"" have said and felt myself.Not to sure on the genre though as it has a bit of everything, action, thriller, drama & even a hint of sci-fi as well as being quite emotional in parts. And either way you see the film going it at least has an ending you cant really find anything to complain about which is a rare thing to see in films these days.The cast and acting is top notch and with the story pretty much of award winning standard I thought. Story is good, flows well and is easy to follow and get into. Though the sci-fi element is slightly unrealistic in today's world, but maybe more realistic in the next 20 years or so.For me, a great film, certainly not less than an 8/10 and came close to giving it a 9. So do yourself a favour, ignore the so called ""professionals"" & ""experts"" for once and watch what is actually a great film.",Self-less

She's not much to look at and when she cries........oh, lord look away. Every time she was on I asked myself why? her? Must have been a close friend of someone's and they begged someone to give her the part. Maybe she paid them to be in this movie. You can't cast RR and have her play his wife. Totally didn't get it...........no chemistry. Not even close.......maybe because he was a ex military guy they needed a low budget looking woman to play his wife.

144,ideorium,haven't seen worst!,1,18 July 2015,"Yes, very solid and very straight forward - awful! predictable, such cliché action... utterly not what Tarsem's filmography was about if you liked Fall, Cell and immortals. I don't even know where to start. I accept that I might've kept my expectations in different direction because of the fact that how heavily visually powerful films Tarsem had and might've expected them same as I am big fun of the way he used visuals and sound in his previous works. But here with Self/less all i could get is a very predictable boring film, not properly considered scenes like -hey we have a super Rich man lets make all his apartment heavy golden decorated interiors, cluttered looking! wow we couldn't't've come up with something more creative! I am really wondering what the motivation was when Tarsem decided to make this film. Was he really need in money or something?",Self-less
145,Wikingking,An action flick with some idea,7,12 January 2016,"Self/less was a really fine experience for me, as I didn't expect this much although I liked the premise. Story is that an aging and terminally ill businessman (played by Ben Kingsley, who gives one of his finest performances in a while) is still in the top of his game, but death is inevitable for him now. He struggles to accept that it's game over for him, so when he seems to have an opportunity to change things a bit, he grabs it without hesitation. A controversial and secret medical procedure called ""shredding"" transforms one's consciousness into a freshly made and perfectly healthy body, and side effects are minor. Damian is now becomes Edward (played surprisingly well by Ryan Reynolds), a human being with a new face, new identity but with the same memories. He can now continue where he's left off - but his former self of course had to die for the public, so it's kind of a one way ticket anyway. Damien is all happy now, he lives life, everything seems perfect - only that he has nightmares and strange yet extremely lifelike visions. When he tries to leave his temporary safe-house and see if he can uncover the story behind one of his visions, things run out of hand.Self/less is a bit cliché but it 'tries'. It has a nice little (may I say fresh?) sci-fi story which is certainly not that thought-provoking, but better than expected. The pace of the movie fluctuates, we have less than expected action sequences but those are made well. What this movie did right is that I somewhat cared about the protagonist and wanted to see the outcome of the movie, it kept me in the edge of my seat most times - the movie is pretty exciting. Acting and casting is exceptionally good for the genre, most actors did a really fine job with this one. I also liked that the protagonist acts fairly reasonably in most cases - a delight in these times when most heroes are dumb but somehow end up victorious in the end.What movie does bad is that it didn't try to avoid unnecessary cheesiness in some cases. There are way to many dumb clichés around the protagonist and his female/child companion. They are those scenes when you can tell the outcome of the story 30-45 minutes before it's on-screen, just because of badly written sentences. Also it would have been nice if there were a more philosophical approach towards the main idea behind the film. I don't demand a new Matrix here, just a tiny bit more than this, because the film uses the idea as a motor for new events (and that's OK) but it could have been more brave. All in all, Self/less is a pretty good action movie with good acting, nice story and some heart as well. I really liked it, and if you like movies of the genre (The Island, Looper, Limitless and such), you don't want to miss this one!",Self-less
146,yiskarasmussen,Highly Entertaining,10,22 August 2017,"I loved this movie. It's one of those theoretical stories that challenges the ethics of medical and scientific advancement, and whilst being thoroughly entertaining, it also leaves you with a lot to think about...Damien Hale is an old man, he has been informed that he has only six months to live, but just as he is making peace with the fact, he is offered a second chance at a rejuvenated life. What would you do? He goes through with the procedure, but shortly after begins to discover that the choices he's made have dire consequences... Again he must chose, and again.

Well, that's his right to say, but for others it's a much more complex issue. I believe a film has a responsibility to be something more than mere entertainment. A porn film is mere entertainment. First off , a film needs some originality of which this film had none. When a film just regurgitates older films it must have something unique. Again, this film had none. The story it self could have been so much more! I want to have to THINK. I want to have to see it 2 or 3 times because it's so intricate I need to. Why cant Hollywood write a screenplay anymore? Look at South Korea for example. Every year 4 or 5 amazing films come out of that country made on a tenth of this budget.

Yeah, I have a really cool mom :P :DSo, I said let's watch the trailer and see what it's all about. Liked the trailer, so I decided to watch the movie.The idea itself makes you think about the decisions one takes in life and how they affect you later on, how regrets overwhelm you and how it is that immortality seems such a divine option that we all dream of and how that can be a total disaster if not managed correctly.Damian is a business man who finds himself in the last phase of cancer, with 6 months to live. He decides to go to this secret clinic to make a transfer of consciousness into somebody else's body. He is being lied to from the very beginning by being told the bodies are grown in the lab. He wakes up in this younger body and he tries to move n with life. Suddenly he has all these dreams with a Hispanic woman, a child and he suspects the lies he was told. He goes to find the location he had in his dreams and finds out that the woman and the child actually exist, together with the young man's body he now is. Here is where all his problems start and the action is really intriguing. I'd say this movie worth 2 hours of your time, it is not exceptional, but it's good.

153,samerabdallah,"An intelligent, skillfully polished Sci-FI thriller",8,18 November 2016,"How come such a clever film passed under the radar when it was released and did not get the attention it deserves, when it could be considered in the league of films such as ""The Sixth Sense"" and perhaps have a cult following if wider audiences were acquainted with it. This great film was not served by its tittle ""Self/less"" which is frankly not appealing; I wish the guys behind the film had made an effort to choose another title that would be less off-putting. I will not go over the plot widely discussed here by other fellow reviewers, but suffice to say the story line is very original and clever, and the film works very well as an action thriller, with twists here and there, but above all it is not superficial when its main character Damian is wondering about his legacy, immortality, trying to redeem himself, and coming to terms about the meaning of his life and trying to do what is right as he has been given a second chance.The choice of actors couldn't be more inspired, with both Ben Kingsley and Ryan Reynolds excellent in conveying their inner doubts, with Ryan Reynolds moving at ease in familiar territory for him (the action scenes), and Matthew Goode superbly creepy as the cold calculating manager with whom Damian is dealing. Technically the film is spotless and gripping, and is not easy to forget. Highly, highly recommended!",Self-less

We all think about the old age, when we will become full of wrinkles,unable to do anything, we all think to all the things we could have done. Time flows so quickly, we have scarcely time to make project but we don't have time to see them realized but probably this is what is right. Movie is based also on love: we all in life have to love someone, to cling to a person we trust in. It's expressed very well also the concept of ""loss of identity"":There's always a period in life in which you don't know who you really are, you feel lost, you don't know what are you doing and you start to live the life of an other person,the life of the character that is been created by your friends,parents,sons,wife.",Self-less

All they have added here is that the switching is done in an underhand way which I'll leave the details out to those who haven't seen it.Take the music/soundtrack. It's terrible. Sounds like elevator music. Saved on budget perhaps?. Compare this to Blade Runner or Oblivion. The movie doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. Melancholic like Blade Runner? No. Action packed like Minority Report, where the agent also goes underground to right a wrong?. Not really. He goes rogue but then meets associates throughout the film and they hardly even care. Paradoxical, unpredictable and intriguing like Edge of Tomorrow, within an existential threat? No, just a couple of people running some sort of identity scam. I came out wondering what was the point.Yes, it had meaning for the individual characters, their lives and their identities, but there just didn't seem to be any emotional resonance or reason to what they were doing. It's almost as if the film-makers deliberately took out the emotional content, and told the actors they were all in some sort of dream and not to care too much about the details. And so the audience doesn't really care either. Needed major re-writes/re-doing to get more emotional involvement and resonance.",Self-less

I mean, what annoyed me was the fact that you have IMMORTALITY yet you focus on a single man who is fighting against that. So basically it was like a cliché.The movie is also predictable, but that might be just me. I liked the action though, it was fast, brutal and exciting.

Granted Reynolds has been in a few duds and frankly nothing short of lobotomy would have sufficed now I am a true blue action adventure freak and without tons of caffeine I fallout easily without 'MOVES - basically anything that will capture and keep my attention..I personally feel this is comparable to ""Safe House"" as far as that sharp witted and quick instinctual moves that I buy extra popcorn for.. and though Denzil carried his fair share of merit in giving it the seemingly non-stop action-packed storyline it's high value to me.

There's nothing exciting or unique about the second half of the movie and you'll probably be bored, especially since Ryan Reynolds does not convince as an action hero. There is also something very unclever about the way the conflict with the villain resolves. Basically Ryan Reynold's character just thinks really hard about how to fix the situation, and finally he figures out a way. One wonders why he didn't think harder earlier...

I used to think that Ryan Gosling was the workhorse, all-around actor of the new era but I'm so sick of him. Reynolds pulls this film together as a dead soldier, and dead-ish real estate tycoon a-hole perfectly. And to think I just watched him as freaking Pikachu a week ago! Versatility, I tell ya.Really though, this is a great Hollywood film, with some loose plot devices that while they started to bug me I quickly let them go as this is quite a Fantastic plot in the first place. Action scenes abound and the sound is incredible. But what really impressed me is how I really felt the main character's pain; as another man, as himself, as a dead version, as a Father, as a failure.

I ran into this film on Netflix and hadn't heard of it, probably because my kids were little then and I stopped following new movies closely as I couldn't see them in theaters. It definitely gave me more insight into Ryan Reynolds' appeal, which had mostly eluded me before.My suspicion is that this film didn't work as well on a large screen, but the action sequences are well-staged, and you've got Sir Ben Kingsley and Michelle Dockery fer cryin' out loud. OK, Sir Ben could have troweled on that New York accent a little more lightly, but his performance launches the movie with enough energy that I was drawn in. The film's trite electronic score, which mercifully intrudes less as the film progresses, may have contributed to its bad reception. Is the movie predictable as charged? Only in the way that all sci fi thrillers tend to be, but its ending is also the logical conclusion of the story the movie tells.

179,taxiservice,"Wow, this is one very underrated film!",9,6 September 2017,"When I read the summary of what this film was about I wasn't too sure this was going to be either my cup of tea, so to speak, or amount to much... how wrong I was! You might think Ryan Reynolds wan't the best choice for the main role of this film.... I disagree - he pulled it off in fine style. There are a few actors who mainly play comedic roles who are actually pretty damn good actors, wasted a lot of the time in the roles in which they end up and Ryan Reynolds is one of those. In the films in which he has played more solid roles, in the main, he has made some very watchable stuff. Sadly, there isn't enough of it... anyway, on to this film in particular.The story-line is certainly one I haven't come across before and as a film buff, I have seen a lot of films, so that is a plus! Matthew Goode was brilliantly creepy as the baddie and did a great job of his role as always. (Why does the baddie always have to be English in American made films? Rather a stereotype! One star off for this, sorry.) The equally wonderful Victor Garber and Ben Kingsley hammed up the business mogul role to a T - love them both. I haven't come across Natalie Martinez much, but she was solid, too as the forlorn wife/widow/mother and Jaynee-Lynne Kinchen will surely be one to look out for in the future if her performance in this film is anything to go by. The film moved at a nice pace with plenty of twists to keep you on your seat. It wasn't predictable and you were never quite sure of the end result until you found it out. I like films like that - so many are predictable and you just sit there waiting for the inevitable end scene... it just depends on how long the film is as to how many interim scenes you get beforehand - I am sure you know what I mean! There was plenty of action in this film to satisfy fans who love that stuff. BUT, what was particularly appealing to me was that it made me think... and quite hard, too. There were some tough moral concepts in this film to get your head around and the solutions not at all clear cut. What would you do if put in such a situation? Hmmm... So, all in all, I would recommend this film as a really good watch, but probably not after you've had a few pints or similar, as you won't get it beyond a certain level of mental fuzziness. Very definitely, this is an underrated film and I sincerely hope that it is one that becomes cult viewing in a few years, because it deserves to be.",Self-less

181,jeffsswearingen,"Selfless is an good overall theme for this movie, don't you think?",7,28 October 2019,"If I had to compare this to any movies it would be The Island meets Limitless. I personally found this movie to be a welcome treat especially since it has to do with ultimately doing the right thing in the end. Ben Kingsley plays a man named Damian who is in the business of closing some of the best deals in real estate market (in New York I think). The audience soon discovers that he has no more then six months to live. He is given an invitation to look at an company that uses something called shedding technology. He ponders this decision and decides to go for it after asking a few questions of the owner of this shedding tech company. The company has a few conditions such as he die in a public place after he gets his final affairs in order. He flies to New Orleans and does just that after drinking a certain coffee in a New Orleans restaurant. Things get even moreover interesting from there. His mind gets put into the body of a young man played by Ryan Reynolds whom Damian was told was created in a lab. Damian starts to adjust to being in his new body slowly and finds that he is told to take a red pill everyday to ward off the side effects of the body transfer. He starts to see things such a people, places and things that he has never seen before thus showing the audience that this body once belonged to a real person and just wasn't created in a lab like a mindless human robot. Reynolds starts living hIs life in New Orleans in the so called highlife with one night stands in the nicest houses and coolest most expensive cars but pre life flashes still haunt him. Reynolds's becomes shocked and anger at the shedding company after he discovers the horrific truth that his new body is indeed someone else and not grown in a lab like some sort of human robot. To make a long story shorter he decides to stop taking the red pills by the movies end and previous owner of Ryan Reynolds body gets his life back in end. This is a movie that makes me think If I would choose the right thing in the end and give the life back to it's previous owner or would I shake it off and just live the rest of my.....his life like I was wearing a new very expensive suit. Just a few thoughts for us to ponder folks.",Self-less

183,tourbine,"Actually not a bad movie, but...",1,17 January 2021,"I agree with one of my fellow critics here. It would have been nice to see Damian's character develop a little more. Not only, but also because Ben Kingsley is by far the better actor - in my humble opinion. The story is good and full of twists. Only the last 15 minutes or so lose in tension and get too predtictable. It seems like the makers - Netflix - wanted to do their usual: Get everything to the end that the viewer expects and that satisfies the U.S. American requirement for ""the good always wins"". So after all I gave this movie six stars.
And now for the big BUT. It is quite obvious from the bginning that Apple products are being held into the camera way too much. In several scenes an actor, mainly the lead, just pauses in his movement just when the inevitable backlit fruit is visible. Too many scenes include the actor setting up the Apple laptop - completely uselss for the plot or the movie. But the really great BUT happens in a scene, when that criminal, doctor, villain compares Edison, Einstein and Stevieboy Jobs. Two genius scientists and the CEO of a marketing company / money-making-machine? At that point the movie lost five points on it's rating, which brings it down to a 1 at the end. Leave the product placement, but bring it down to a level so it doesn't become ridiculous. It is a valid source of money for today's movie makers - at least in the USA.

Apart from that, the film is full of clichés. How is a rich man depicted? by having a house literally made out of gold (to each his own, but it's the ugliest, most bling and tacky place I've seen in a movie for a long time). How is an activist woman working for an environmental association shown? by working in a poor neighbourhood of new york with volunteering college kids. The list could go on with a mean, emotionless and unethical scientist or a poor but nice and darling American housewife who's husband was a war hero... Also the film feels old, and not even old school. It feels like the director stopped watching movies in the 90s and took all of his ideas from pictures of that period, from the Fugitive, Face/Off, etc. It's very natural to be inspired by others, however, it's best to try to transcend those inspirations... which I think, this movie did not.

So, you would assume he'd be smart enough to figure out that the hallucinations were memories. You don't have to be a genius to know that. Do you? And just what did he think he would say when someone answered the door, which was opened for every burglar and potential movie murderer?

But, maybe it's my fault for expecting an indie smart sci/fi similar to Ex Machina, Safety not guaranteed, Mr. Nobody... Maybe they should have clarified it was an action film with some mediocre sci-fi tones.So, if you just want a simple action film, it's a fair movie, pretty average much like the majority in the action genre.

It basically steals the concept from that and turns it into a run-of-the-mill American action flick. Nothing in this movie stood out except the concept of the movie. This movie had the potential to explore its themes and original concept but instead we got a watered down action flick where you really cannot feel anything. The main character has glimpses of complexity but ends up being kinda one note and boring. Honestly, if you like an action flick to watch if you have nothing else to, it is serviceable.

I get pretty excited when I see something that I actually care about and this was quite entertaining for me..most movies are relevant to in different ways, so take that for what it's worth. I'm a movie lover. I saw this film with the hopeful intention of walking away with a little bit of a Born Identity kind of feel, something considered to be at least surface entertainment and I was not disappointed and that is an understatement. The action and story opener with Ben Kingsley as the main protagonist was well executed, as was the claustrophobia inducing transformation into Ryan Reynolds. One of the things I was actually worried about from the preview wasn't even about the content of the film but more how under the radar that I felt it would be in the public eye. Ryan Reynolds is not by any means a bad actor and that's his problem, with something so serious and Sci-Fi oriented we're almost reluctant to even approach his ability to draw you in. We see his films and usually know what to expect because he's so likable. Ever since Waiting he's been hard to avoid, but nothing about his roles offer anything compelling and that's not really his fault. I respect his quest for versatility..I really enjoy his role in this movie, actually..the things that are great about this movie really sparkle.. I have to say the best part about this for me would have to be the directing and the Music..my God, they really pulled of some wonderful suspense...some moments made my skin crawl..they utilize an almost Hans Zimmer technique likened to Joker's theme song in the Dark Knight but it doesn't feel rehashed. It's a thoughtful cerebral thriller with the fat trimmed away, it doesn't linger in too many places..the pacing was great. There was not a boring moment and in fact most of it had me cheering, mentally. I even like the ending, thought it was beautiful. The only thing that bothered me was the closing shot of the film, it was so simplistic that it was almost like man...dude, you could have had a classic on your hands, most may not take it to that level but I promise that it's at least likable to anybody.

Break for a pathetic scene where he bonds with the child and shows his sensitive side while the wife watches, resolve past life relationships and then make the ""self less"" sacrifice at the end so everyone is happy despite the young child witnessing multiple acts of violence and death.

At the first 30-minute-mark, it definitely seemed like a good choice though. Then, every tiny thing in the movie becomes almost a hundred percent predictable and follows a very cliche storybuilding, and bad -awful- acting comes in. At some point, the sci-fi element of the movie becomes absurd, with some objects and events defying the rules of physics, likewise bulletproof glasses easily melting, or bullets surviving MRI machines. In this absurdity, the whole focus of the film goes from scientific to action-oriented, simply guys chasing each other with guns kind.

206,niteowljr,Not a classic but better than the critics would have you think,7,19 April 2016,"Ben Kingsley, fantastic as usual, portrays wealthy, dying businessman Damian Hale, who subjects himself to a process known as ""shedding"" which, at the point of death, transfers his consciousness to a much younger, supposedly lab-grown human being. When the process is complete, Damian's ""replacement,"" portrayed by Ryan Reynolds, begins to experience unfamiliar memories. Reynolds dispenses with the snide humor he's so famous for and, thankfully, plays this one straight. After a bit of investigation Damian comes to realizes that his new body was not artificially produced. He discovers that he inhabits the body of a former highly skilled soldier. Damian must contend with those from the soldiers past as well his own, leading to a showdown with the scientist that developed the ""shedding"" process.The first act is somewhat slow but that pace gives Kingsley a chance to evolve the main character from a selfish, self-centered individual to a much more sympathetic character. Once Reynolds takes over and discovers the deception the film hits its stride. There are a few minor twists, enough to keep things interesting, with the fate of both star's characters revealed only at the end.I'm not sure why anyone would suggest that this movie devolves into a series of chases and inane action sequences as some critics have unless they stopped paying attention. The action sequences are relatively brief, don't detract from the story and, as far as I'm concerned, are necessary to drive the narrative.

What some critics have mistakenly refer to as ""corporate blandness"" I believe has been mistranslated as 1. subtleties in Ryan Reynolds acting, attempting to actually talk and act as Ben Kingsley would. With 2. A mixing in of a little ""fleshing-out"" of the film via some Bourne Identity-esque action sequences (Yes, some of us have seen it before, but somehow it still feels almost as fresh and exciting as the first time when Ryan Reynolds does it.) So whats been overlooked? Some seriously great shots, storytelling ability, writing and acting, not to mention emotional sequences that were not expected.

But I did not like how the female's part was written... the role was shallow and repetitive. i also found the bit about Ben Kingsly's relationship with his daughter to be a cliché... a rich man estranged from his only daughter and he tries to win her back by offering her money.. we've seen this many times before. despite that, I still enjoyed the movie because it makes you think: what would you do differently in your life if you got a second chance? it also makes you think: why should a healthy and clever mind go to waste because of a failing unhealthy body? isn't it such a waste? I say go see it... it is entertaining ciao",Self-less
218,dr-nayar,A good story and hugely entertaining !,7,24 August 2015,"The idea in this film is not exactly brand new but hugely entertaining with good fight scenes. A flash back to the ""original theme"" is a narrative in the Hindu puranas.The protagonist being a king in the ancient times on becoming an old man .. apparently the clause being he can exchange the old age with any one ! .. only one of his sons agree ..and the king gets the youthfulness from the young man and According to the story, Yayati enjoyed the sensual pleasures for a ""thousand years"" and later realized the futility and said, ""Know this for certain, ... not all the food, wealth and women of the world can appease the lust ...... craving and seek that which neither grows old, nor ceases even when the body ages."" Yayati then gave back the youth to Puru, receiving his old age in return.The young Damien realizes no matter how long he lives his desires would have no end ...and to live with the knowledge its another humans life after all !! He then does what he was not able to say to his real daughter and do what he had to",Self-less
219,jason-mintun,Fantastic Original movie,10,15 September 2015,I've never reviewed a movie before but after watching this one I was extremely pleased. I saw that this movie only had a 6.5/10 on IMDb and no one I've mentioned it to has seen it and couldn't believe it. I'm not going to go into too much detail because I don't want to spoil anything and I hate reviews myself so I'm just on here to try and raise this movies rating. It was very enjoyable. This movie had my ADHD attention the whole entire film. Ryan Renyolds gives a great performance and so does the supportive cast. It's been a while since I've seen a movie with an original story. Watch this film. Am I at ten lines of text?,Self-less
220,jun_fat28,Great entertainment,7,9 September 2015,"It is another wonderful piece of scifi movie!First of all, it has a very exciting plot! The plot is very interesting, the first 20 minutes would want you to stay and finish it, the story starts with with Damian, Ben Kingsley, that gives a good start, although the scene with him did not gave out much of a story, it works very fine to start. Then the story and the plot at the near half becomes simplistic, that excitement drop, but it seems to be the general thought, thats why it becomes very common. On the way to the end of the story it becomes brilliant in a way , the perspective of the protagonist becomes conscious, this starts the another sub-plots, another story to deal with but this gave the story more color. Then again, as the story ends, it gave out a very sweet desert which thirsts me. Lastly, the ending has one of the most wonderful and beautiful scene ever in a sci fi or any movie which is nice ending.Secondly, about the actors, they all did perfectly for their roles, Ryan Reynolds is very perfectly fits the Role as young Damian, he portrays the exact person you would be on the situation, anna, the daughter, portrays a very charming daughter, suits the expression from a child who has disease. They all fits and act perfectly on every situation, but a talking without looking a speck on their eyes.Lastly, the directing was obviously mediocre, the movie was good, the story, the plot, the actors, its just not a winning movie for me, there's something missing, maybe it focused too much story, which did not give emphasis to the core of it. The movie is compared to other well knowned sci fi movie is better but it is on the same level, it did not give a best of the plot, best of the wonderful idea. For the conclusion, it is a very entertaining Sci Fi movie everyone would like, very much, but on the other side it is no different to other SciFi movies, from the whole.",Self-less
221,ken_kilgore,A very entertaining movie with a good ending,8,13 December 2015,"I like Ryan Reynolds and was surprised to see one of his movies reviewed as mediocre. After watching, I concluded that the reason for the negative reviews was the conclusion of the movie, not the plot nor the acting. You see, the movie shows a character who elects to do the RIGHT thing, not the ""me first"" thing-to conclude the movie. A character who follows the rules of doing what is right/not what is expedient, is viewed as unrealistic by our current batch of critics. In this film, the main character elected to surrender his own future, because it was the RIGHT decision. Critics prefer films which do not promote anything suggestive of traditional values, which is why I believe they rate this movie poorly. If you enjoy an entertaining science fiction plot, and appreciate a good ending where the primary character does the right thing, I believe you'll like this one.",Self-less

223,patgiacobbe,Felt rushed in areas,5,3 June 2021,It's the kind of movie that starts to explore the details and then suddenly you get yanked back at each junction. The movie is around 2 hours. If the studio had told them you have 2.5 hours maybe it could have been written differently to elaborate key areas and expand upon the story as a whole. The entire thing felt rushed. Compare this movie to Limitless. That had a round story. Selfless didn't feel like this.,Self-less
224,nelsonktm,"Very nice movie with great story idea, lot entertaining !!",9,31 August 2015,"After watched the trailer, I knew it this is the movie I must watch this year. I am a bit worry at first, how much deep can this movie goes despite trailer has told quite much. It held a lot of clues at the beginning and it all ended well until the last scene of this movie. There were touching scenes, funny scenes, thrilling scenes, exciting scenes and heart breaking scenes all rolled into one movie. I thought the action scenes were great, and if more fighting scenes will be perfect (remember from his army combat skill)Go have fun and see this movie, you'll be happy you did!Thank you for making such great movie.-Love",Self-less
225,damirh,An excellent film!,9,7 September 2015,"If the so-called ''experts'' mark G.I.Joe higher than this film, they should certainly sell their brain and buy a new one, even if it comes from a butchers'... The film is great, a mix of action-packed thriller with a lot of moral dilemmas that refer to dramas, and even with the deeper meaning if you want to find one. Anyone with at least a half a brain will enjoy it, those with less can watch some Marvel production instead... Anyway, I certainly recommend it to anyone who searches for a good movie that can be challenging if you want, or not if you don't want it to be. A message to ''experts'' who give it bad marks: Please do something else, you're just making fun of yourselves...",Self-less

227,gonzalezjackelyn,Don't Miss A Good Story,10,19 September 2015,"Didn't understand how many great films would get bad reviews. However after reading through some of the negative reviews here I got the picture. Most people come into a film with expectations because of actors/actresses, directors they like or something like that. A film should be treated with a blank slate or unread story. You should let the story unfold just as you would to listening to someone telling theirs. But most people have trouble with that characteristic so it's hard I get it.Personally I enjoyed this movie. See my points below:1. Nice Storyline Overall 2. Details were on point especially those that people might have overlooked 3. Lessons everywhere in the movie - Most common about power, having it, thinking he/she has it, losing it, and doing anything for it 4. Nothing in this movie seems like it is impossible especially action scenes. Don't get me wrong I LOVE Fast and the Furious but there are a gazillion points in that movie that make me say ""yeah right"" 5. Witty Humor and comments 6. Great portrayal of each location 7. Different Age Groups Involved 8. Morals throughout 9. Almost positive this ""Shedding Thing"" is happening in our world today, we have the science etc. 10. Action, Love, Science, Wealth, Humility - Awesome combo in the movie.Thanks for reading and enjoy!",Self-less

229,mdraeper,Awful...couldn't't even finish watching it,1,15 October 2016,"So, here's the setup: really rich real estate mogul (Ben Kingsley) is dying of cancer. He lives in a high-rise condo that looks like it was decorated by Tony Montana and P. Diddy. Ben Kingsley does a great job playing the act of a dying man by acting completely normal.One of his last business moves is to kick someone out of business for merely saying something against him so we know his character as a little bit vindictive and self serving. He's also alienated his daughter and said she's been wasting her life on some Greenpeace- like charity.Then he's told by a secretive company that he can have a new lease on life at the cost of $250 million dollars and that he's been chosen because, alongside, Leonardo Davinci and Abraham Lincoln, he's just too valuable to society to lose...and he's such an egotist that he believes it. He's also shown a half-shaven Ryan Reynolds and told that this is his new body that was grown in a lab. After the brain transfer, which apparently requires having a fishnet over your face, he awakes to find that he has weird flashback memories that aren't his and also that he now looks and acts like Ryan Reynolds. His handler explains that this is just normal, and take his medicine. They set him up with a Lambo, suite house in the French Quarter of New Orleans, and he has a stream of ladies.But he still has weird flashbacks, so decides to track down where he suspects his body is from and immediately tracks down the wife of the guy who gave up his life. His daughter had a quarter of a million in medical expenses so he gave of his life to get his daughter cured. Rich guy finds this morally repugnant so begins shooting all of the people who helped him live longer. Why? Well, who knows, but then it devolves into an action movie with flame throwers, climbing through grates, and escape scenes. That's when I stopped the move and decided I couldn't't bear to watch another second of this drivel.2/10 - Screenplay: Pretty cool for the first six minutes though but that doesn't save the movie.9/10 - Filmography: Shot beautifully with some nice camera work. T2/10 - Acting: I don't blame the actors. You pay them to show up -- you don't pay them to make your crappy movie make any sense. 1/10: Overall: I give this movie two middle fingers for wasting my time.",Self-less

231,urokrk,Utter Sheet,1,15 August 2017,"Kingsley is a money taking whatever. Premise is that 'somehow' consciousness can be 'downloaded.. not only that but it can be the 'uploaded' into another sorta dead but not quite explained person's head! It's so bad coz it's so effin pretentious with no grasp of some pretty deep stufff. Seriously, Kingsley can wrap himself up in himself. He phones in a ham and eels performance that's offensive.
