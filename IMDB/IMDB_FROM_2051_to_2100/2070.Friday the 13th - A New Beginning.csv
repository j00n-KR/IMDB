0,TheLittleSongbird,A new beginning?,5,7 January 2018,"'Friday the 13th' may have been panned by critics when first released but since then it is one of the most famous and influential horror films, the franchise containing one of horror's most iconic villains. The film is popular enough to become a franchise and spawn several sequels of varying quality and generally inferior to the one that started it all of. The fifth film in the series 'A New Beginning' is the most maligned 'Friday the 13th' film by critics and fans, although it has garnered a cult following and its fair share of defence over time. To me, 'A New Beginning' is better than its reputation and that it tries to do something different is laudable. Also do not think it's the worst 'Friday the 13th' film. Having said that, the disappointment is understandable. There are good merits here, but it also did fall short to me. Starting with 'A New Beginning's' strengths, the best things about it are the as ever haunting music score and the terrific performance, both disturbing and moving, of John Shepherd. There are a few darkly funny moments, a few creepy ones and some of the death scenes are creative. The nightmare sequences are stylish and as nightmarish as one would hope. It's a pretty decent looking film, not cinematic art (but in all honesty that can never be expected from a 'Friday the 13th' film) but not amateurish.However, there are things that work against 'A New Beginning'. From my understanding, It is not that the film is different in the lack of Jason (this didn't bother me at all and is an insignificant issue), the more tongue-in-cheek tone and the idea it tried to introduce that irked fans, but the generally misguided way it was executed. More problematic are the problems as a standalone. The acting is not good (Shepherd is the sole exception), Melanie Kinnaman being awful, and the clumsy and far too simple dialogue, that slips more into vulgar camp than darkly tongue-and-cheek, and the mostly annoying and dull stereotypes passing for characters fare worse (the only one to be interesting and get proper development is Tommy). 'A New Beginning' has the highest body count, and while there are some creative and unsettling deaths (others less so, hurt by gratuity and predictability) it was almost as if there were too many death scenes that gives one not that much time to compose themselves after each one. There is not enough suspense, the creepiness is too far and between and the story is thin and very hackneyed, with one of the series' silliest endings. The mystery elements don't work, being far too obvious, and neither does the identity of the killer, the killings committed by somebody that is not in it much in their real guise and doesn't have much presence.In summation, not that bad and not deserving of its black sheep reputation but a long way from being great. 5/10 Bethany Cox",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
1,Leofwine_draca,Worst of the series for sure,2,19 July 2016,"Another year, another film. But wait - wasn't Part 4 the end of the franchise? Well, no, not while there was still money to be made in the sequels. So it's simply a case of ""another year, another sequel"" as a masked killer once again goes on the rampage to kill innocent victims. This instalment is particularly trite and silly, with an extremely loose plot, exceptionally unlikeable characters who deserve all they get, and a lack of creative murders. What made Part 3 particularly amusing was the reliance on bizarre deaths - take the eyeball-popping and the handstand slicing for example. Here, it's just a never-ending run of stabbings, slashings, hackings, and various other brutalisings, all of which have been butchered by the BBFC anyway. There's hardly any gore at all. A flare-in-the-mouth gag is the best this film has to offer.When a movie kicks off with a cameo appearance by Corey Feldman who proves to be the best actor on screen then you know something has to be wrong. There's a natty dream sequence which sees Jason butcher two gravediggers but after that it all goes wrong. We're introduced to a mental institute in the woods, which is inhabited by normal teenagers like in the other movies - only a couple of them have any apparent psychological problems (one girl's miming to a dance tune is obviously the result of severe trauma - or just a by-product of '80s ""coolness""!). It's a stock group of sex-mad couples, nerds, losers and bimbos. Surprisingly, the clichéd fat guy of the group gets hacked to death within minutes which makes a nice change.The deaths are all portrayed unseriously, and in some instances it seems as if the film invites you to laugh at them! Aside from the prolonged stalk and slash ending (predictable), there is little real horror here. Just the familiar ingredients - topless girls, racism, drug-taking, decadent behaviour and bad language. John Shepherd is awful as Tommy Jarvis, wooden in the extreme and with a fixed expression. The two offensive backwoods ""hicks"" characters are the most obnoxious I've ever seen in a film - and even their respective beheading and machete-in-the-face deaths are too good for these repugnant reclusives.Guaranteed to get up any fan's nose is the silly twist ending which has the murderer's identity revealed. A silly, incomprehensible conclusion to a forgettable film lacking almost entirely in positive aspects. Jason fans, give this entry a miss.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
2,SnoopyStyle,Spoiler,6,15 October 2013,"An older Tommy Javis (John Shepherd) returns from a series of institutions still haunted by his encounter with Jason. He arrives at a secluded halfway house for troubled teens. One of the teens is killed by another teen. This is just a prelude to a whole series of gruesome murders.There's an easy answer to why this one is rated so low. They tried to replace Jason with Tommy Jarvis. People will kill you for that. But as a movie, this is a pretty good improvement. This franchise has finally shed its indie feel and joined the other big horror franchises with more competent filmmaking. This one starts already different from the beginning. It's no longer Crystal Lake. To have a copycat doing the killing is already expected seeing where the story is located. It's a bit of a surprise that they don't make Tommy Jarvis the copycat right from the start. The turn of Jarvis has great shock value. However to continue the franchise, they had no choice but to bring back Jason.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
3,claudio_carvalho,A Festival of Clichés in Another Unnecessary Sequel,4,25 January 2004,"Tommy Jarvis (John Shepherd), the character performed by Corey Feldman in Part IV (`Final Chapter'), has grown-up and is a deranged young man. He is sent to a clinic in the middle of the woods, to be readjusted for the society. Jason starts killing again. The story is exactly the same of the previous part, only this time it happens in a mental institution in the woods. Indeed, it is a festival of clichés: cars do not get started, screams, raining night, stupid murders, Jason seems to be dead but it is not and holds the ankle of a character etc. The only thing  new in this movie is that the producers deceived the viewers: the last part 4 was called `The Last Chapter', and they released `A New Beginning'. Only for killing time (in the good sense).  My vote is four.Title (Brazil): `Sexta-Feira 13  Part V  Um Novo Começo' (`Friday 13th  Part V  A New Beginning')",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
4,kosmasp,New Chapter?,6,8 November 2020,"After the final chapter, we seem to have a new chapter. And funnily enough (or is it), we get one major character back from the previous movie. And no I'm not referring to Jason (he always returns, right?), I mean Jarvis ... who still is played by Feldman in the intro of the movie, just so we jump ahead a little bit, time wise and see him more ""mature"" (read: played by another actor) - apparently Feldman was doing Goonies or something else at the time.So this is one of the Jason movies that is considered to be a lesser one. Quality wise, but especially because the audience felt a bit cheated ... and that is because this does something Halloween did too ... though in this case I'm not even sure who copied whom ... or if it is a coincidence. It would be a spoiler going into the details, so I spare you that and leave you with the twist, if you don't already know it. The movie is decent overall though I would say, if you can accept that ending ... dig it?",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
5,gavin6942,I Think I Stand Alone in Loving This Film,6,27 April 2007,"Tommy Jarvis, now all grown up, lives on a funny farm because he is unable to handle the stress of flashbacks regarding Jason Voorhees. When the residents of the funny farm begin to get killed off one by one, is Jason back from the dead to kill again or is someone using his modus operandi to hide their mental instability?Part five (this film) is generally considered one of the worst in the series. The acting is cheesy, the plot is weak as usual, and the main character only says about 25 words throughout the entire film. So it's safe to say I stand alone when I say this is one of my favorites in the series.I adore the cheesiness. Even the redneck neighbors, who are so extremely unbelievable, I find to be hilarious. The gore is respectable here (it grows as the series goes on) and there is enough nudity to satisfy most viewers. This movie also continues the tradition of people using the bathroom and not wiping -- often being killed on the toilet or right after.The defining moment in the film for me (and probably only me) is the scene with Tiffany Helm (who plays Violet) is dancing to Pseudo Echo's song ""His Eyes"" from their ""Autumnal Park"" album. I really felt the song was perfect for the film, and the scene overall really put this as an 80s film. While for many films dating yourself is bad, I think horror actually gets better when the viewer is aware the movie is from the 1980s or 1970s. Each decade of horror has a very unique feel (much like how the 2000s are now becoming the ""torture decade"").If you're watching this one, it's probably because you saw the first four. If you liked those, just keep going. This one will be enjoyable for those who liked part four, and will be one of the last good ones until part nine (""Jason Goes to Hell""). Part 8 (""Manhattan"") is weak, and part 7 (""Jason versus Carrie"") is over-rated, so take in the fun while you can.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
6,lee_eisenberg,"Danny Steinmann, RIP",5,7 February 2013,"Danny Steinmann just died, so I decided to talk about one of his movies. ""Friday the 13th: A New Beginning"" is the fifth entry in the series. Most of the movie is pretty much what you might expect, although there is a twist. I will give them credit for coming up with some neat murder scenes, namely the one with the leather strap. As always, there are scenes containing the things that ""Scream"" identified as the things that get you killed in a slasher movie. It's a pretty fun movie.A little piece of trivia: Miguel A. Núñez, Jr., who plays Demon, also played Spider in ""Return of the Living Dead"", and Richard Young, who plays Matt, also appeared in ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" as the man who gives the young Indy his hat.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
7,jboothmillard,Friday the 13th: A New Beginning,5,9 September 2015,"The first film was good, the second was okay, as was the third, and the fourth film was ""the final chapter"", but of course there's always a way to bring back an iconic killer in scary movies. Basically the previous film saw young Tommy Jarvis (The Goonies' Corey Feldman) kill hockey mask wearing psycho Jason Voorhees (Tom Morga), he is seen wandering through a graveyard at night, he witnesses two grave robbers digging up his corpse, Jason rises and kills them before advancing towards the boy. This is a nightmare, Tommy (John Shepherd) was dreaming, he has grown up, but is still haunted by both his killing of Jason, and the thought that he will return from the dead to kill again. Tommy is being taken to a halfway house to try and return to a normal life, at this location are director Pam Roberts (Melanie Kinnaman), head doctor Matt Peters (Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade's Richard Young), Reggie (Shavar Ross), Robin (Juliette Cummins), goth Violet (Tiffany Helm), shy Jake (Jerry Pavlon), short-tempered Victor ""Vic"" (Mark Venturini) and compulsive eater Joey (Dominick Brascia), two other residents, nymphomaniac lovers Tina (Deborah Voorhees) and Eddie (John Robert Dixon), are brought by Sheriff Tucker (Marco St. John). The location is is nowhere near Camp Crystal Lake, it is in Pennsylvania, and soon enough an unseen killer shows up and starts to continue his rampage of revenge, for the death of his mother. The masked killer's killing methods include a road flare shoved in the mouth, throat slashing, an axe, eyes gouged out with a pair of garden shears, a belt tightened and crushing a skull against a tree, a cleaver, stabbing and many more. The film ends with Jason once again defeated, for now, but not all is as it seems, there may have been some involvement of ambulance driver Roy Burns (Dick Wieand) or something, and when it looks like Tommy has recovered from the nightmare, he is seen wearing the killer's hockey mask and holding a knife, ready to attack the person he is in the bathroom with, so you are left questioning if the real Jason was alive and killing at all. Also starring Carol Locatell as Ethel Hubbard, Vernon Washington as George, Bob DeSimone as Billy and Rebecca Wood as Lana. With the twist ending you don't know if you are watching Jason Voorhees doing all the killing or not, it was apparently a setup for a new series all together, but to be honest you ignore the new Jason thing anyway, the deaths may be slightly less bloody, but they are still inventive and timed well enough, and there is a slight storyline to go along with that keeps you interested, a pretty good horror. Worth watching!",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
8,Woodyanders,Marvelously scuzzy and mean-spirited slasher schlock,9,19 September 2010,"Okay, so this film ain't no exceptionally fine, subtle, and tasteful work of sophisticated cinematic art, but it is so incredibly crass, coarse, and unapologetically trashy that it's always entertaining and occasionally even downright sidesplitting in its gleeful go-for-it offensive nastiness. Director/co-writer Danny Steinmann deserves credit for effectively creating and sustaining an engrossingly sleazy atmosphere throughout and eschewing the by now exceedingly tiresome summer camp slaughter format for a fresh and different approach that's essentially a vulgar American version of a giallo complete with numerous red herring minor characters (although the killer's true identity is pretty obvious the moment he appears on screen), a hefty body count (22 murders altogether!), a very twisted sense of pitch-black humor, and a priceless surprise grim ending. John Shepard delivers a solid and sympathetic performance as Tommy Jarvis, who still traumatized after killing Jason Vorhees gets sent to an experimental home for troubled youths. Other goodies to relish: Melanie Kinnaman as the perky Pam Roberts makes for a very fetching and appealing final lady, Shavar Ross as the lovable Reggie the Reckless wears a ridiculous red jumpsuit and sporadically cuts loose with these hysterically shrill girly-man screams, Carol Locatell as batty and profane old crone Ethel Hubbard and Ron Sloan as her dim-witted fat oaf of a son Junior provide gut-busting lowbrow comic relief, Miguel A. Nunez, Jr. as cool Michael Jacksonesque bad-a** Demon meets an ignoble fate by being impaled on a spike while trapped in a revolting outhouse, and Tiffany Helm as funky punkette chick Violet does a supremely boss herky-jerky robot dance to Pseudo Echo's extremely catchy ""His Eyes."" Better still, this flick sure doesn't skimp on the tasty gratuitous female nudity: buxom blonde Rebecca Wood-Sharkey bares her ample wares simply because she can (""It's showtime!""), gorgeously voluptuous brunette knockout Debi Sue Vorhees relaxes buck naked after doing just what you think with her boyfriend in the woods, and deliciously lissome redhead Juliette Cummins strips down to her panties and talks to her topless reflection in the mirror prior to climbing into bed. Why, we also get some coke snorting and pot smoking to further enhance the wondrously pervasive seaminess. Alas, the gore is regrettably mild stuff, but overall this entry in the popular slasher series is so utterly sordid and bereft of any redeemable artistic merit that it nonetheless rates highly as a prime putrid piece of gloriously rancid celluloid sludge.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
9,Tweekums,Has Jason Voorhees returned from the dead?,7,9 January 2019,"Several years have passed since young Tommy Jarvis killed Jason Voorhees and brought the killings at Crystal Lake to an end but he is still troubled by the events. As the film gets underway he moves to a halfway house for troubled teens and it isn't long before the first death occurs... there is no mystery about this though; one of the residence kills another with an axe and is arrested. It seems that this has triggered something else though and soon another, unknown, killer is attacking numerous people in the area... both those at the halfway house and locals who happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.In many ways this is more of the same as a killer murders numerous, mostly young, people. There are plenty of important differences though; people learn that there is a killer on the loose fairly early on and there is a decent sense of mystery concerning the identity of the killer... is he the troubled Tommy Jarvis, Jason back from the dead or is it somebody else entirely? Little time is spent letting us get to know the new characters before the deaths start but by this point in the series it is more about a body count than deep characters. The final resolution to the identity of the killer works well, even if it might not please too all fans. The cast is okay, even if many of them seem a bit old for the roles. Overall it is hardly a great film but it delivers what is expected.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
10,BA_Harrison,No Jason. No good.,4,12 December 2008,"Part 5 of the Friday the 13th franchise offers yet more mass murder by a kill-crazy fiend in a hockey mask, only this time it ain't Jason doing the slicing and dicing (he's dead, remember?): someone else is imitating the Crystal Lake killer, targeting the staff and patients of a half-way house for psychologically disturbed teenagers.Could it be the new boy at the homeJason's killer Tommy Jarvis, now all grown up but still troubled by the incidentwho is responsible for the grisly killings? Or has someone else suddenly got chop-happy with a machete? Will you even bother to make it to the end of this lousy film to find out?With this dreadful 'whodunnit' style plot that crams in as many predictable genre clichés as possible, director Danny Steinmann stands about as much chance of delivering an effective horror as the film's fat kid does of escaping a nasty death. The awful script also features a roster of thoroughly annoying characters just begging for an axe in the face, including redneck farmer Ethel, her moronic son Junior, a pair of leather-jacketed greasers who suffer from car trouble, a black delinquent with 'soul glow' hair and his Vanity-alike girlfriend, and an alternative/punk girl who does robotic dancing. Honestly, I couldn't wait for them ALL to die!Unfortunately, when these irritating idiots do finally get the chop, the results are very disappointing. With Jason taking a break, Part 5 lacks the imaginative kills that fans have come to expect from the series; his stand-in just doesn't have the Vorhees touch. When it comes to hacking up teens, this film's killer just goes at it with the nearest sharp object without applying any thought; the result is a collection of uninventive death scenes that lack style and finesse (and also desperately require more gore).About the only thing that is done right is the obligatory T&A: one girl gets topless, another strips off completely for a spot of 'al fresco' sex, and a waitress gets her norks out for absolutely no reason whatsoever. And whilst the heroine doesn't exactly bare flesh, she does get very wet during the predictable rain drenched finale, and she ain't wearing a bra!!! (I'm know I'm ranting a bit now, but honestly, there's not much else to get excited about in this film).The identity of the killer is finally revealed at the very end, but the revelation is a complete let down, and unless you've committed yourself to watching the entire series, it's not worth suffering all the rubbish that goes before to find out who it is.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
11,Quinoa1984,"Oh yeah, I'm sure",4,1 October 2000,"I remember seeing this film recently but I also saw this film when I was maybe 10 years old.  A horror film like Friday the 13th part 5, well, I usually got scared by horror films, but with this one I fell asleep.  That shows how bad this film is.  I almost couldn't even follow the plot, mainly because I knew it before it started (teens in a camp get there just desserts from the man in the hockey mask) and I think this enstallment is the least favorable one.

12,BandSAboutMovies,Sleaze in front of and behind the camera!,5,13 April 2018,"Presenting the scummiest, vilest Friday of them all - a film packed with more kills (22!), more nudity and more drugs behind the scenes than several of the other films combined!Years after killing off Jason, Tommy Jarvis has nightmares that the man he killed has returned. That's why he's in Pinehurst Halfway House, where Pam Roberts and Dr. Matt Letter (Richard Young, who gives young Indy his fedora in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade) are trying to help him to get over his violent past and the death of his mother.But are there a bunch of teens to get killed? Sure there are. There's Reggie, Tommy's roomate whose grandfather George works there as a cook. Plus, we have Robin (Juliette Cummins, Slumber Party Massacre 2), Violet (Tiffany Helm, O.C. & Stiggs, Reform School Girls), Jake, Vic (Suicide from Return of the Living Dead), Joey, Eddie and Tina (Debi Sue Voorhees, no relation). There's also rich neighbors Ethel Hubbard and Junior, who want the halfway house closed down.What follows is a bit of a mystery movie, at least for a bit. Is one of the kids the killer, like Vic, or has Jason come back from the dead? Even the end of the movie leaves that up in the air, to be honest. It's kind of a mess, but along the way there's a ton of blood and gore.Danny Steinmann is the director here, perhaps better known for The Unseen and Savage Streets. Well, maybe not by most people, but by me? Of course. He also broke into movies by directing and writing the adult film High Rise and probably would have created more films in the Friday the 13th saga, but a bicycling accident and long recovery meant that this would be the last film that he would direct. The working title for this film was Repetition. So what happens after this? Well, what do you think?",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
13,Coventry,Swing your machete !! ( spoilers !!!!!!),5,20 September 2003,"Ok, which number is this again ? Oh yeah, we were watching part 5 of the Friday the 13th series which is ( I'll tell you already ) really bad!!! ""A new beginning is an appropriate title because the makers of did film tried to let the corpse of Jason Vorhees in his grave. The killer in this in this one is an exact copy of his image but that's it. In fact, it's more or less the same story as number one but they didn't think it through...Why, for example, would a father start a killing spree to avenge his son if he didn't care for him to begin with ??? Can somebody please explain that to me ? At least Mrs. Vorhees slashed youngsters with a reason in part one...She loved her boy !
All the rest fits right in the whole image of the series... nasty killings, bad acting, nude girls ( lots of them ) and annoying characters. You can't wait for them to be slashed in gruesome ways. The biggest mistake they made concerning this part 5, was that they wanted more draught in this episode...That didn't work out. Part 4 was a decent film because it just wanted to be a slasher film and nothing more than that. A new beginning wishes to be a little more and they blow it there...We need less talk and more Jason ! Of the 10 Jason films out there, I think I recommend this one the least...not only due to the absence of Jason but for the complete finished product. It sucks badly...for example, have you ever seen a romantic scene in which a young couple is singing together while one of them is taking a dump ??",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

15,hitchcockthelegend,Nudey prod games disguised as a Jason Vorhees movie.,4,4 October 2011,"Friday the 13th: A New Beginning is directed by Danny Steimann who also co-writes with Martin Kitrosser and David Cohen. It stars Melanie Kinnaman, John Shepherd, Shavar Ross and Richard Young. Music is by Harry Manfredini and cinematography by Stephen L. Posey. The fifth film in the Friday the 13th series, plot follows on from part 4 and finds Jason Vorhees' young killer Tommy Jarvis (Shepherd) now as a troubled young man. After spending years moving from various institutions, Tommy's latest home is the Pinehurst Youth Development Center, and pretty soon after his arrival it appears that Vorhees has risen from the grave and is killing everyone in the vicinity....Well it ultimately wasn't a new beginning in the context of the franchise, but it is a different ""Friday"" picture. With a fresh idea at its core, and carrying a genuine mystery element, there was a boldness lurking somewhere amongst the brains trust behind the picture. However, these nifty ideas are undercut by insipid direction, bad acting and a blatant attempt to be crude and mean spirited. It isn't hard to figure out that director Steinmann was once a pornography director, for the film plays out as a series of nudity for nudes sake sequences, engulfed by a meaty killing every other five minutes. You can only have so much of each before it gets boring, and A New Beginning gets boring very quickly. Thus making the only reason to stay with the picture is to learn the big ""reveal"" of the new hockey mask wearing lunatic. It may be enough for undemanding horny horror fans, but it's an undeniably lazy picture.Still, there's a little comfort in that the makers added some twists, and the film, if you can look around the breasts and meat cleaver, actually has some of the best colour photography in the franchise so far. There's also some great characters, none more so than a nutty hillbilly Mother and Son double act, while for those who like a pretty face, Melanie Kinnaman looks fabulous, making us believe that if all the correctional youth center lady wardens looked like this? They would be far more packed than they already are! By now the ""Friday 13th"" slasher fan wasn't expecting too much anyway, which gave Steinmann and co the excuse they needed to suffocate the good ideas born at the writing table on first draft. Shame that, but if rank and file nudes and stabs are solely your thing, fill your boots with this one. 5/10",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
16,Hey_Sweden,Watch this one with a big bowl of stew on hand. But no damn enchiladas.,8,13 July 2012,"Well, there was only one thing to call this sequel since the previous one had been touted as the last one. Yup, it's a ""new beginning"", and poor Tommy Jarvis (John Shepherd) is a very messed up young adult after his encounter with expert sadist Jason Voorhees. We pick up his story as a nightmare-plagued Tommy (Corey Feldman briefly reprises the role of young Tommy in an obligatory cameo appearance) is transferred to a halfway house for troubled teens conveniently located in the woods. The gruesome slaughter of one of the kids soon paves the way for yet another delightful assortment of barbaric death scenes. Could it be Jason? Or could somebody be merely using the Jason name and modus operandi to commit murder for their own reasons?We're given a couple of possibilities, including Tommy himself, in this infectious entry. Don't go into this one looking for scares, suspense, or atmosphere. In fact, this is far and away one of the most mean-spirited and sleazy F13 sequels, with a body count guaranteed to keep some slasher fans happy. We can thank co-writer and director Danny Steinmann for that sleazy tone, as his credits include the classic 1984 exploitation flick ""Savage Streets"". Means of murder are varied here somewhat, including an ingenious form of head crushing. What we also get here is an appreciably tongue in cheek quality at times, as there are many moments where the only possible response is laughter. We learn, for one thing, that there's no time like after taking a dump for people to burst into song. ""Rat-a-tat- tooey"" and ""Ooh baby, hey baby"" are both very fine and amusing ditties.Cast members such as Rebecca Wood-Sharkey, Juliette Cummins, and the beautiful and well endowed (and aptly named) Debi Sue Voorhees supply us with all important breast shots. Gorgeous female lead Melanie Kinnaman doesn't extend the same courtesy, but she's an enjoyably tough cookie, confronting ""Jason"" with chain saw in hands. A couple of familiar character actors - Marco St. John (as the goofy, smirking, cigar chomping sheriff), Carol Locatell (as Ethel, the queen of the rednecks), Richard Lineback (as a deputy), Vernon Washington (as lovable old George), handsome Richard Young (as Matt, the director of the halfway house), Miguel A. Nunez Jr. (as the ill fated Demon), and Mark Venturini (as the last guy in the world to whom you'd want to give an axe) - all make this fun, but it's Shepherd who stands out - this guy really is pretty good! Continuing the trend from ""The Final Chapter"" in having a strong child role, Shavar Ross of 'Diff'rent Strokes' is the engaging Reggie the Reckless.You add all of this up, and it's a riotous good time for any slasher fan, and it really doesn't matter how much or how little the actual Jason gets to do. The movie's not as gory as it could and should have been (censor interference reared its ugly head again), but it's still consistently entertaining for its 93 minute running time.Eight out of 10.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
17,preppy-3,Actually pretty good,7,2 August 2006,"This takes place about 10 years after ""The Final (right) Chapter"" (which places it in the mid 1990s!). Tommy Jarvis (John Shepherd) is basically mentally disturbed and is being sent to an institution called Pinehurst. As soon as he arrives there people start getting murdered by Jason--but Jason was cremated after he was killed. Is it Tommy finally being driven crazy or is it somebody else? This actually differs from the other sequels--it actually has a story! Also it has an astronomical body count--20! Most of them were cut down by the MPAA to get an R rating however. For those curious--14 men are killed and 6 women.This has all the same problems as earlier movies and then some--there are continuity errors left and right; some truly terrible acting (Melanie Kinnaman as Pam was the worst); bad dialogue; Jason being able to seemingly teleport to magically appear wherever he wants; gratuitous female nudity; two extremely annoying hillbillies and characters so stupid you want them dead! But it has some good points--this is the first Friday the 13th to have black characters; it's never boring; there are very few character scenes (considering how bad they were in the past this is a very good thing) and there is actually some good acting from Shavar Ross, Jerry Pavlon and John Shepherd. The sequence where Shepherd single-handedly knocks the hillbilly cold is a highlight.A lot of fans hate this--it's dismissed as ""the film without Jason"" and considered (along with part 3) as the worst of the series. I disagree. It's no masterpiece by any means but I was always entertained. I give it a 7.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

The incident shakes everyone at Pinehurst up, except Tommy who is used to witnessing axe murders... That night two guys name Pete (Corey Parker) & Vinnie (Anthony Barrile) car brakes down & while trying to repair it they are both brutally murdered, as more bodies begin to turn up Sheriff Tucker (Marco St. John) starts to think that Jason Voorhees is responsible...Co-written & directed by Danny Steinmann Friday the 13th: A New Beginning is the fifth entry in the popular long running Friday the 13th franchise & one that I actually really rather like & I regard as one of my favourites despite the general opinion (it seems) that it's one of the worst, if not the worst, entry in the series. The script by Steinmann, Martin Kitrosser & David Cohen moves along at a nice pace, has a few intentionally amusing moments in it & tries to take the series in a different direction & while not completely successful one has to say the Friday the 13th series is rather linear, repetitive & samey I liked the fact that this was trying to do something different yet it didn't stray too far from the origins of the series that made it successful with the fans unlike the worst entry in the series Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday (1993). I liked the isolated retreat for troubled teens setting & it certainly makes for a nice change to the usual teens out camping scenario, I thought the character's were pretty good when compared to the usual slasher film clichés & Friday the 13th: A New Beginning has the highest body & nudity count of any Friday the 13th film which is a definite plus in my book. As everyone knows by now this is the one where someone impersonates Jason & I think more could have been made of this element of the story, this could have been a top murder mystery with a great twist climax unfortunately it comes out of the blue & almost like an afterthought. I think it's because of this 'it's not the real Jason' thing that a lot of people don't like it, all I'll say to that is that original Friday the 13th (1980) didn't have Jason in it, Jason as a character in his infamous hockey mask didn't appear until half way through Friday the 13th Part III (1982) & what about the aforementioned travesty that is Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday? However when all said & done I liked this one, quite a lot in fact & I don't care what anyone else thinks & it's as simple & straight forward as that.Director Steinmann does a decent job, it has a nice atmosphere with a cool climactic thunder storm. The nudity count is higher than any other in the series & so is the body-count, unfortunately like all of the other Friday he 13th films the censors got their scissors to it. Thre are screwdrivers stuck in peoples necks, machetes in stomachs, slit throats, implaings, heads crushed, eyes plucked out with hedge shears (in a scene that looks like a homage to another slasher The Burning (1981)), there's a decapitation, an axe in someone's head, someone has a flare stuck in their mouth, there's a meat clever stuck in someone's face & there are various mutilated bodies strewn all over the place. Having said that there isn't much tension or build up to the murders & a few seem a bit flat.With a supposed budget of about $2,200,000 Friday the 13th: A New Beginning actually took almost 10 million in ticket sales during it's first weekend, it's well made enough with decent production values I suppose. The acting is alright but then name me one Friday the 13th film which does have good acting in it? I bet ya can't...Friday the 13th: A New Beginning seems to be disliked by many people although just skimming through some of the comments on the IMDb it does also have it's admirers of whom I count myself as one.

That said, it might as well not have been a Friday THE 13TH film at all - given that it's set nowhere near Camp Crystal Lake and the killer is not even Jason (though it follows on from Part IV by having the Corey Feldman character from that film grow up to be an unbalanced teen...but the film still seems to be taking place in the 1980s - WTF?!).

The story takes place at a halfway house for mental patients. Tommy from the last movie is all grown up now and looks 250% different due to the terrible recasting of the part. Dull-as-dishwater John Shepherd is the new Tommy, replacing Corey Feldman (who appears at the beginning in a dream cameo, confusing things unnecessarily). Early in the movie a guy takes an axe to another guy for no apparent reason except to give the movie's Jason impostor a reason to kill. Contrived and stupid beyond belief. Still, the movie does have some things to recommend.First, there's Dudley from ""Diff'rent Strokes."" Up until this point his biggest fear was being molested by the Bicycle Man but now he has to worry about being chopped up by a homicidal maniac. This was Dudley's chance to step outside of Arnold's shadow and he does quite well. Second, there's the character Demon (Miguel Nunez) and his outhouse adventure. You have to see this. It's like Scorsese just stopped by the set one day and offered to direct a scene. Third, and most importantly, there are the magnificent breasts of Debisue Voorhees (no relation to Jason, I hope). You will believe in God after witnessing Ms. Voorhees au naturel.While this sequel is not the best of the original series and the cop-out of Jason not actually being in it is a letdown, this is still miles better than parts 9 or 10. There's nudity, more four-letter words than you can keep count of, and lots of amusing kill scenes. It's dumb but it's a fun dumb.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

22,Boba_Fett1138,A bit too lame at times.,5,30 October 2009,"Well, basically this movie is just as good, or bad if you will, as most of the Friday the 13th sequels but with as a big difference that this movie is a bit too much filled with some horrendous and just plain lame moments. Especially it's attempts at comedy are laughable, for all the wrong reasons though.This movie meant a fresh start again for the successful horror series that started out in 1980. They tried out some different stuff for this movie, by leaving out Jason as the killer this time, though he is still present this time. The movie is perhaps more of a whodunit, though the movie itself doesn't seem to really realize this and simply goes one with its bloody killing-spree, without providing any explanation or show any logic. It already always had been a bit weird at how random Jason seemed to kill his victims but in this movie this is even more the case, since it isn't the actual Jason himself doing the killings this time but a person of flesh and blood, who has taking over the modus operandi and look of Jason Voorhees, who had died in the previous sequel.Its killings are still pretty good and graphic looking though, so that at least should please the fans of the genre in some ways. But they also would probably be somewhat disappointed by this 'fresh' start of the Friday the 13th series. After this movie they would soon bring back Jason again for the following sequel, starting with the one year later done movie ""Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI"".The characters in this movie also aren't being exactly among the best out of the series. The movie also features Tommy again from the previous movie entry, only this time as an adult. He's being a bit of a wasted opportunity in this movie though and they could had done some far more interesting stuff with his character, that could had also perhaps made him a far more interesting and important character within the entire Friday the 13th series.A bit of a failed attempt but it does has some redeeming qualities in it for the lovers of the genre.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

He goes to a new one, meets some people, and a guy in a hockey mask kills people(many of whom have only just been introduced before they're taken out in an unimaginative way, with no build-up or tension, and since they're almost all obnoxious, we don't care about them... the worst might be the two redneck stereotypes; this also features Michael Jackson, straight out of the Thriller video), though Jason is dead. Right? For the first time, we don't have to deal with a recap. The Child's Play 3 take could have been fine if we cared about the lead(or ever did), or if there was just something, anything, there to enjoy. Since the concept this sets up was not followed up on, the entire thing is pointless(it's very clearly a ""middle"" picture, bridging two flicks, the latter of which does not exist), and as it's done with such little care, we never get into it. The filming and editing are awful. Acting is pitiful and over the top, and many of the actions make no sense. This sorta tries for red herrings, yet it's obvious who is slaughtering. It's never exciting, even the ending is dull. The humor is terrible. We usually just see the aftermath of people getting whacked, and the FX are lousy when we do. There is gore, blood, violence, sexuality and nudity in this. The DVD comes with a theatrical trailer that is pretty ""meh"".

But, if we're making a ""New Beginning"" Jason can be anybody right?I think this Friday the 13th was more sitcom-like than any of the others. They even had a sitcom star in Shavar Ross playing Reggie (Shavar may best be known as Dudley on Diff'rent Strokes). Everyone was a caricature. Not a single character could be taken seriously.At least this time they were away from Crystal Lake (I think).The prey were still in a summer camp setting except it wasn't a camp, it was a retreat/getaway for troubled youth. One of those youth happen to be Tommy (John Shepherd), who has not been normal since going berserk on Jason in part four. Is it a coincidence that the moment he shows up to the retreat that people start getting ginsued?Even though there wasn't nearly as much sex, and no skinny dipping; enough boob shots were worked into the movie. Maybe it's the 80's, maybe it's the woods, but bras weren't worn apparently. All the women ran around with one layer of fabric between thine eyes and their breasts.

Yes, this is the installment in the interminable ""Friday the 13th"" series that thought it would be a good idea to do without its only reason for existence...the hockey-masked Jason. Though you hardly notice the loss, since you don't KNOW it's not Jason until the film's final moments, and the copycat killer dresses like Jason anyway, so what's the difference? If you've seen one axe-wielding psycho in a hockey mask, you've seen them all.Actually, I kind of like this entry. It provides the best nudity of the series....no fewer than three gratuitous boob shots, and nice boobs they are. And it's funny, sometimes intentionally so, as when the hillbilly mom calls her dufus son a dildo, sometimes unintentionally, as when the Michael Jackson look alike sings a duet with his girlfriend through an outhouse wall while he's on the crapper.And the filmmakers outdo themselves with the body count this time around. By the end of the movie, there's no longer time to show them being killed off. Characters you've completely forgotten about just pop up as dead bodies. But what do you expect with all that plot to get through? Compared to the other films in the series, this is practically ""War and Peace,"" what with the murder mystery story and the Tommy Jarvis plot line, which attempts to add a sense of continuity to the middle batch of movies (o.k. so Part 6 picks up Tommy's storyline in a completely different place and with a different actor, but for a series like this that's the best you can hope for in the way of consistency).Grade: C",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

Not entirely sure what to make of it, Tommy begins to settle down into his new surroundings hoping that things will eventually work out. Unfortunately, not long after he witnesses one of the inmates being hacked to death more killings begin to multiply which raises the possibility in his mind that the nightmare is far from over. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this particular sequel was one of the weakest in the series due primarily to the minimal suspense and very poor character development. It does, however, have an interesting ending but that doesn't quite make up for the rather tedious and painful journey getting there and for that reason I have rated this film accordingly.

There's a lot wrong here in regards to making this a true franchise effort, which starts with the identity switch at the core of the film. The general concept of the situation itself is enough to cause uneasiness here with the blatant bait-and-switch employed here, but it's also how it works in the confines of the story as there's little done here to hide who it is since it clearly highlights this the first time around at the murder-site, and when it comes time for the explanations behind it they make even less sense, causing this to be flawed all the way around. Besides this, there's another rather big and really crippling factor here in the series of utterly pathetic and lame kills featured, as everything here is simply stabbings or impaling with the knife, and even then the vast majority of deaths are stumbled upon after the fact anyway, which again really tends to throw quite a big problem on the kills being so flawed here. Lastly, the finale chase here comes off as being a rather tired retread of the chases before it, running all throughout the woods protecting a younger male only to wind up back in the house where it all started, bodies being hurled through windows and ending the whole thing in a barn that's all reminiscent of the other entries in the franchise. Even with these flaws, there's some really fun parts here which are based solely on the basis of this one being a slasher as this one produces a rather sizable and impressive body count, producing the greatest amount of kills in the series even though they're pretty lame. That also works here in creating some fun stalking moments. The ambush on the greasers on the roadside, the surprise on the necking couple in the woods and the attack by the diner all offer some solid slasher motivation scenes giving this a rather great series of somewhat suspenseful stalking scenes. As well, the action of the final chase works for a great time as there's a frantic pace and energy here for a lot of chasing around and even allowing the girl to fight back at times which is nice and helps this one nicely. Along with the copious nudity, these makes this good enough even through the flaws here are pretty detrimental.Rated R: Full Nudity, Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, a sex scene and drug use.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

The actor(John Shepherd) who was cast as an older version of Corey Feldman is fine, but this sequel is just stupid, with lots of clumsy and unfunny humor from its foulmouthed backwoods mother and simpleton son, along with the expected graphic violence.

When Tommy is sent to a rural halfway house in New Jersey for mentally disturbed teenagers, a series of grisly murders begin as someone has begun killing off all people at and around the residence. Has Jason returned from the dead to re-start his killing spree...... Or Has Tommy decided to take over the reign of Jason, or someone else.........Like Season Of The Witch, Friday Part 5 goes outside the box for its story, having a copycat do the killings this time round (you can tell it's not Jason, because the hockey mask has blue stripes instead of red).And although this is regarded as one of the weakest entries into the franchise, it's pretty solid stuff, especially as the studio decided to do something different with a successful, albeit slightly stale, franchise.So Tommy returns, and in the years since Jason's demise, he's turned into someone else, learned Karate, and decides to speak fewer lines than The Terminator.But crucially, this is the film where the makers decided to inject just a little humour into the film, and this is given to us in the form of the backwoods mother and her stew loving son. They don't appear to be intentionally funny, but I couldn't help but raise a titter whenever they appear on screen.Otherwise, it's business as usual for the narrative of the film, loads of nudity (the film was directed by an Adult Movie maker), and some very impressive kills.But what makes its stand above a lot of the sequels, is the ending, it's a genuine clever twist.But once you've seen the rest of the movies, the very final shot makes no sense whatsoever, unless it was a dream within a dream, which would be an easy excuse.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

31,Wuchakk,"Heavily criticized, but one of the most entertaining and re-watchable installments",7,11 March 2014,"I find the ""Friday the 13th"" flicks appealing because they typically involve young adults in a fun camp-type environment in the woods; the presence of a lunatic killer just adds an air of danger and excitement. Although this fourth sequel in the series is maligned by many, it's the installment that turned me on to the long-running franchise. Say what you will but ""A New Beginning"" ( aka Part V), is one of the most entertaining and re-watchable segments.Released in 1985, the story centers around a halfway house for troubled youths deep in the sticks (filmed in Camarillo, California). Tommy Jarvis, who is still traumatized by the events of the previous film, arrives at the home, now approximately 17 years-old. Murders slowly start mounting up leading to an action-packed climax. Since Jason clearly died in the previous film, who is the killer? Is it Tommy?The first two films in the series were serious murder-mystery horror pictures. Part III added campy elements, which is the case with Part V. Although ""A New Beginning"" plays it semi-straight, it's filled with black humor (e.g. when the ambulance man kneels over a hacked-up body and makes a hilarious comment to the frightened youths standing nearby), not to mention the OTT goofy mother/son hillbillies. In fact, there are so many laugh-out-loud moments that it's almost a comedy. Which is not to say it's bad; like I said, Part V is one of the most entertaining segments. If the campy hillbillies turn you off just chalk 'em up to side entertainment.The deep woods halfway house for people with emotional problems is an interesting set-up and caught my attention right away; it sets this installment apart from all the others. In addition, Tommy, played by John Shepherd, is an interesting character: He's understandably troubled and there's a mystique about him (is he a hero or a mad killer or maybe both?), not to mention he can kick some arse when he has to. Speaking of which, a critic complained about Tommy's fighting skills being unrealistic, but it makes sense that he would do something like learn martial arts over the past five years to occupy his time and cope with emotional trauma and loss. There's nothing unrealistic about it.The film is also notable for featuring perhaps the best assortment of women in the series: three blondes, a brunette and a redhead, no less. The lead blonde, ""Pam,"" is played by Melanie Kinnaman, the protagonist of the story, who's so striking it's hard to take your eyes off her. What's interesting is that Melanie is one of the few comely females in the cast that is never shown nude or partially nude. She's fully clothed the entire picture (although she has a wet-shirt moment) proving that a woman doesn't have to flaunt her beauty cheaply to get attention or instill awe.***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read this paragraph if you haven't seen the film). Aside from being entertaining like most of the installments, it should be pointed out that Part V does something better than any other film in the series: It shows the long term negative EFFECT Jason (and his mother) can have on people. Jason isn't physically present but his lingering, haunting diabolic presence permeates the atmosphere. So much so that Jason de-creates in his own lunatic image with the killer and Tommy Jarvis donning the mask at the end. In fact, the ending leads one to the conclusion that either Tommy has gone psycho or that he is the new embodiment of Jason (although Part VI implies that it was a dream or Tommy's imagination and not reality). This isn't that outlandish of a theory given that ""Jason Goes to Hell"" (Part IX) explains that the demonic thing that possesses Jason has body-leaping powers. It may very well be concluded that Roy and, later, Tommy were possessed by the spirit of Jason in this manner. Adding support to this theory is the superhuman strength displayed by the killer throughout. For example, he literally smashes through a door, breaking it to pieces, he hurls an adult man up and through a window, he decapitates a guy with one swipe of a cleaver, etc. No ordinary human being could do these things, unless they were possessed by a malevolent force/entity. ***END SPOILER***Some of the cussing is a bit overdone. I'm sure the filmmakers threw it in as a comical touch. It goes without saying that if you find overkill cussing offensive you might want to skip this one.BOTTOM LINE: ""A New Beginning"" is just a fun and entertaining deep woods horror flick with numerous highlights noted above, including black humor and camp. It's easily the most all-around kinetic movie in the series and one of the few that works as a mystery, like the original.As to the criticisms regarding the absence of a certain character, again, the film does a good job of showing what can ultimately happen to those severely traumatized by Jason. Not to mention the fact that Jason IS present in spirit, literally. So, yes, it's a vital part of the series.The film runs 1 hour, 32 minutes and was shot in Southern Cal (Camarillo, Beverly Hills & Los Angeles).GRADE: B+",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

Granted the film keeps going, the killings are relentless and there is nudity. But almost all the film and its characters are cliché and the power of the constant killing is undermined by the fact we don't care. We don't care because we are hardly introduced to the folks about to die and most of them a pretty irritating. The only decent scene is that in the barn near the end, there is suspense and we are involved in the action. The movie should, however, have ended here because instead we get more over the top silliness and consequently the film ends on the same low it began.

We cut to him grown up, but he's still in a home for troubled and ill teens who go to a home, that is close to Crystal Lake.

John Shepherd follows in the footsteps of Corey Feldman by playing Tommy Jarvis. Strangely, he's aged about fifteen years, but the time period doesn't seem to have differed. Bad writing, perhaps? According to IMDb trivia, the screenplay originally centered around Feldman, but he was contractually obligated to appear in other films, so they rewrote his character into an older version. Apparently someone forgot to change the time period to correspond with this.Tommy is in a mental institute now and has been transferred to a minimum security free-for-all looney bin where he's basically allowed to do whatever he wants and is given absolute freedom. He brings a pocketknife with him - it's never explained how he managed to sneak it out of a maximum security insane asylum to begin with.When the Jason imitator begins attacking nearby Tommy takes it upon himself to react. Blah, blah, blah. Oh, did I mention there's a really, really hot nurse who just happens to work there? What a coincidence. I mean, it could have been some old ugly 80-year-old, but instead it's a Pamela Anderson lookalike. Interesting.This film is so bad it's entertaining! The dialogue is atrocious and the acting is even worse. Shepherd is a hoot - he tries to convey all these emotions. It plays out like someone handed him an ""Emotional Faces 101"" tutorial and he just furrowed his eyebrows a lot and appeared to be lost in reflection. Aye carumba! Apart from the horrid acting there is the truly inept direction, the cheesy '80s music (elevator music in a horror film?!) and the cameo by Corey Feldman to ensure preteen females would be interested in seeing the film. The flashback is totally pointless but they manage to creep his smug face into the film anyway! This is better than the last ""Friday the 13th"" because it's more entertaining - in a so-bad-it's-good kind of way. I'd hardly recommend it, but if you happen to be flipping channels one night and stumble upon it, it's quite a hoot.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

38,thesar-2,"Would you like small, medium or supersized?",5,17 January 2009,"An utter improvement over 'The Final Chapter,' 'Friday the 13th: A New Beginning' not only starts off with a creative, uh, ""beginning"" with Feldman reprising his 'Final' role, but also twists to the already beyond-old plot of the 'Friday' films. I appreciate the concept and attempts to divert away from the previous films, but then it turns into the typical 'Friday' slasher. I see disturbing trends in the series up to this point, other than the obvious boob-shots, sex, stupid people doing stupid stuff and slaughter  for those, they finally up'd the ante for 'Beginning' making this the hardest R with the most female nudity (hey guys, small, medium and large breasts to choose from!) and most kills in the entire series, possibly combined. I'm actually referring to these trends: vehicles that only seem to work for a half mile or less, B&W films being the preferred movies to view, bad hygiene after using the restroom/forest and enormously bad dancing (even by 80's standards.) While I read a lot on how this movie got bashed  from paid critics, that is  if one could look past the usual array of awful acting, scenes set up specifically for sexual intercourse/slaughter or stereotypes and clichés galore, I liked the idea that the previous installment, 'The Final Chapter' really was the final Jason chapter (yes, just up to this point) and they actually put effort into attempting a change. Yes, a lot of scenes/characters reminded me of 'Final' and 'III,' but I could actually see efforts being made, although the big secret of the movie is actually easy to figure out. I also like the first recurring character (other than Jason & his mother's consistent flashbacks) Tommy, even though they basically copied 'Final's finale.

39,bensonmum2,"""Jason Voorhees is dead! His body was cremated. He's nothing but a handful of ash.""",3,30 October 2017,"In the five or so years since his run-in with Jason Vorhees, Tommy Jarvis (played by John Shepherd in this film) returns to Crystal Lake to enter a mental facility. Tommy is still haunted by visions of Jason. Tommy has also developed something of an anger management problem. Not long after Tommy's arrival, Crystal Lake is the scene of a series of gruesome murders. Who could be behind the killings? Is it Jason back from the dead? Is it Tommy? Or is it some other, unknown party?I don't apologize for being a Friday the 13th fan. I've been a fan since 1980. But I'm not blind. Not all Friday the 13th movies are created equal. Some are good and some are not so good. If I made a list of favorites, Friday the 13th: A New Beginning would fall toward the bottom of that list. It's not the worst, but it's close. My issues with the film are many, including:Character development - Never a strength in the series, character development is thrown out the window in Part 5. Unknown characters are introduced just so they can be killed five minutes later. A perfect example are the two greasers killed near the beginning of the movie. Who are these guys? It's hard to care whether a character lives or dies when fodder is all they are.Overacting - Junior and Ethel have to be two of the worst characters ever to appear in a Friday the 13th movie. I know a lot of people list Shelly from Part 3 as the most annoying character in the series, but for me, these two take the prize. They are just so over-the-top and unbelievable. I don't necessarily mind a little humor mixed into a film as heavy as Part 5, but his is way too much. Their actions completely take me out of the film every time they pop-up on screen. They're cringe-inducing.The mental facility - What kind of place is this? You gather together a bunch of troubled youths, but still you have more dangerous and sharp implements than you'll find at a knife show. There seem to be knives, hatchets, and machetes lying around everywhere.Roy Burns - Who? I remember seeing Part 5 in the theater and when the killer was unmasked (Scooby Doo style no less), I wasn't sure who I was looking at. Re-watching last night, I see all the hints and clues to the killer's identity, but Roy Burns is such a nothing character that I still didn't recognize him when he was unmasked. In the list of great slasher villains from the 80s and 90s, I've never seen Roy Burns' name listed alongside Freddy, Jason, and Michael. I don't care that the movie included a copycat killer, but make it someone we'd at least recognize.Outhouse serenade - Has there ever been a more ridiculous scene in a movie? It's another low point in a movie filled with low points. This is another of those lists that I could go on and on with, but, as I often say, what's the point?Friday the 13th: A New Beginning is a bad movie with a lazy script, an instantly forgettable killer, and characters we can't care about because we don't know them. Overall, it's a low point in the series for me. I can't bring myself to rate it any higher than a 3/10.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
40,Robert_duder,Truly a new beginning and a bit of a unique spin to the old franchise,6,18 August 2011,"While definitely not my favourite of the series there are certain things that can be said about this instalment of the long running horror franchise. Parts 2-4 had basically the same M.O. Campers, teenagers of some kind, drinking, drugs, having sex, hacked to bits by Jason and then one or two of them who are actually half decently smart of have a significant storyline manage to put him down for the time being. The first film thus was far was the most unique actually having Pamela Voorhees (Jason's mother) as the killer and we get a little bit of a background to the Voorhees family. Now we have Part 5 A New Beginning which brings the character of Tommy Jarvis back again played unfortunately by a new actor (not that he is bad by any means but I like when the same actor returns.) Corey Feldman (the original Jarvis) does show up briefly in the beginning during a nightmare of some kind. For the first time this film takes the action out of the woods, and actually puts a spin on the story by and SPOILERS WARNING...making Jason not the killer. Instead its a man bent on revenge against people he blames for the death of his son. Some people complain about this and granted I am not crazy about the idea of Jason not being the killer but at least they tried to be unique and you can't fault them for that.John Shepherd takes the role of Tommy Jarvis, the only repeating enemy of Jason. Shepherd does okay considering his entire role is looking stunning and terrified about everything. A deer in the headlights. He certainly lacks the leading performer quality. Melanie Kinnaman is Pamela, one of the heads at the home for wayward teens. She I suppose is the closest to scream queen for this film but her character is placid and sort of boring. She doesn't get really any chance to shine. Shavar Ross adds a little spark to the cast as the hyper youngster Reggie. He is probably one of the better performances in the film. Carol Locatell gives a loud and obnoxious performance as white trash Ethel who wants to get her own vengeance on the kids at the home. The rest of the cast is large and without any truly stand out performances. They are picked off one by one just like any other Friday the 13th film and there isn't any point in discussing them. Very oddly I can't find anywhere where it says who played Jason Voorhees in this film.The cast is the reason I felt like this film failed me primarily. I mean no one will say the actors from a Friday the 13th film belong in a hall of fame but at least the series sets up the characters and their personalities. This one didn't do that even with the main characters. This was director Danny Steinmann's last attributed film and I think that he just didn't have a grasp on the heart of the series. It felt like it was just missing a little something and that was disappointing. There were still plenty of deaths, although the first...and only Friday the 13th film to have no nudity at all. And despite the death scenes I felt like overall they were a little bit toned down. Not a lot mind you but just a little. A New Beginning felt like more of a speed bump that slowed the series down. You could almost skip it and still know what's going on but don't skip it because it is unique and continues Tommy Jarvis' story enough to make it interesting. 6/10",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
41,bowmanblue,The most logical sequel (to date) and also the most maligned,6,29 August 2014,"Part 5 of the 'Friday 13th' franchise was not received well. It was largely due to part of the story that I won't go into (as there are some out there who didn't mind it and I won't spoil it for them). However, on the rare chance you don't know the story, it goes along the lines of a masked killer stalks and kills oversexed teens.And, in Part 5, we have more than the normal number of oversexed teens to do away with. There is certainly more of a diverse bunch to be sliced and diced. This is a nice (and new) touch to the franchise, however, it does take away from the story's central theme. It's one of the rare films in the saga to continue from the last one. The child survivor of Part 4 (Tommy Jarvis) is now grown up and still having problems dealing with his childhood trauma with the masked killer, Jason Voorhees. This is actually quite a nice idea, but is always a sub-plot as the film concentrates on killing so many of the cast, leaving little if any time to continue Tommy's tale.Once again, you can tell who's going to die and who's not. Let's face it... 'bad' people never last long in this sort of film (and Jason almost does the world a favour in getting rid of half the cast here!). Also, the death scenes are a little more imaginative and well thought out than in the predecessors.However, for all that's right with this film, fans still return to what's wrong with it. Many believe that this film would have been better NOT being part of the Friday 13th franchise and being a stand alone film all together. However, if you're in the mood for some gore, then you might get something out of this. Plus it has a 'dance routine' that's almost as good as Crispen Glover's from Part 4!http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
42,ericstevenson,Stupid as ever,2,8 October 2017,"This is one of the worst ""Friday The 13th"" movies mostly because of how pointless it is. The killer isn't Jason in this movie and yes, I know he wasn't the killer in the first movie either. It doesn't change the fact that this movie has no reason to exist. A cop at one point thinks that it's Jason committing the murders when it's an imposter. What's the point when he comes back to life for real in later movies? The other cop says Jason's body was cremated but it clearly wasn't in later movies! The other cop does ask if he saw him cremated.I guess the people lied and his body wasn't destroyed after all. Anyway, the kills are as gruesome and gory as ever and this actually has one of the highest kill counts in the whole series and it wasn't even done by Jason! This marks the third serial killer that has ravaged Camp Crystal Lake. You'd think by now they'd learn to take more precautions! All these characters have no personality to care about because most are easily killed. At least Tommy's older. This is the worst movie next to the eighth one. Even fans reacted negatively to this movie as it featured a fake Jason. The hockey mask was still there. This never becomes a plot point in later movies which further demonstrates how pointless it is. The actual plot is that uh, more people are being killed but it's actually someone impersonating Jason who died in the last movie. Couldn't you get that idea from the previous paragraphs? It doesn't even work as a slasher film. *",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

44,CuriosityKilledShawn,(insert review title here),1,30 April 2004,"This movie doesn't even deserve to exist, never mind a review title.After Part IV did much better numbers than expected Paramount greenlit another Friday the 13th sequel (that doesn't take place on said say, again!) for a quick release within a year. But with Jason dead it was up to the filmmakers to come up with mind games to trick the audience, and a now grown Tommy Jarvis is the vessel for those games.Aside from a quick cameo at the beginning (apparently shot in his back yard) Corey Feldman is replaced with a block of wood called John Shepherd. I am told that this is supposed to be an actor but I think it might actually be an antique davenport or a sideboard or something. There's just so much wood.It's now 1989 and Tommy is transferred to a halfway house for maladjusted teens. His confrontation with Jason has messed him up, and apparently his sister just ditched him (it's what they do) as there is no mention of her.Someone starts knocking off the kids in various gruesome, tasteless ways and we're supposed to think that it's Jason, or Tommy, but we only ever see stomping feet or hands at best as many of these deaths happen off-screen. The twist is so confusing that you can tell the exposition laid down by the sheriff at the end was a last-minute attempt to stop the audience from chucking eggs at the screen.One particularly embarrassing scene has Miguel Nunez Jr. (the only actor here to have a notable career) singing in an outhouse going ""Baby, baby, baby, ooh baby, ooh baby, baby, baby, baby."" Though it's face-shreddingly cringy, it accurately predicted the entirety of the lyrical content of pop music post-2000.Director Danny Steinmann started his career in porn and only ever directed four movies (including porn, though he may have directed more under a pseudonym) and he doesn't bring any life to this nasty, bad taste sequel, and it rightfully deserves its reputation as the worst of the bunch.Apparently every single horror film director since the beginning of time thinks thunder, lightning, and rain makes a scene scarier, and it's just one of many tiresome tropes that the Friday the 13th series compounds with each of the lesser entries. As a series it has a lousy reputation despite some good entries, and I'm laying the blame entirely on A New Beginning, which is so unbelievably bad it drags the rest of the movies way, way down with it.A vile, repugnant movie made by a talentless pornographer who never worked in movies again, much like the most of the cast.Put that quotation on your movie poster and skip right over this.

47,ironhorse_iv,"Friday the 13th: A New Beginning is indeed an unlucky film. It try to start something new, but fail at it.",5,13 January 2017,"Set in the year, 1989, the film follows the recurring character from 1984's 'Friday the 13th: the Final Chapter', Tommy Jarvis, now played by John Shepherd. All grew up and still constantly afraid that Jason (Tom Morga) would return. Tommy tries to set up a new life, after spending most of his, in mental health institution. However, his sanity begins to slip away again, as new series of brutal murders have been occurring by a mask killer at his halfway house, who seem to want Tommy dead. Is it a copycat killer, or is Jason really back from the dead!? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, while ""Friday the 13th: A New Beginning"" seem tamer than the other films, it was very surprising to see, how much gratuitous nudity & violence, there were in this film! Honestly, what was the point of the minor character like the waitress, Lana (Rebecca Wood) flashing her boobs at us!? I don't mind it, but be a little cleverer on how you show sex, movie! Also, some of the murders like the punks, doesn't make a lick of sense, after seeing who the killer is, in the end. What did the killer have against Pete Muldrow (Corey Parker) & Vinnie Manalo (Anthony Barrile)!? Does he hates 1950's greasers!? Also, how did the killer find a similar mask with the same axe mark that to Chrissy Higgins (Dana Kimmel) put there in ""Friday the 13th: Part III'!? Aside from its violence, the film has become known for notorious production problems with director fighting with actors, MPAA forcing cuts to sex scenes, and backstage frequent drug use. It must had been a stressful movie to film. Still, much contrary to popular belief, 1985's ""A New Beginning"" was not a box office bomb, as it did well in theaters. However, it was nowhere near as popular as the last four installment. In my opinion, this movie in the 'Friday the 13th' film series was in a no-win situation at the time. Movie critics hates it for its familiar, yet tiresome concept of rebellion teenagers getting murder by a hockey mask assailant, yet die-hard fans of the slasher franchise really hate this movie for departing from the Camp Crystal Lake setting and allowing somebody else to take on the mantle of the killer. It's lose-lose situation. Still, in my opinion, this film directed by Danny Steinmann, is surprising, not that bad as people think it is. I really don't dislike this movie as much as the others. Don't get me wrong, the movie, is nowhere near good, but I do enjoy few horror ideas, it was presenting, like how it was just continuing, what was establish, by 1984's 'Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter' and the previous movies, rather than killing the film series off, with contradiction and film inaccuracies like 1986's 'Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives' did. Another, was adding more suspense and mystery. It wasn't prediction, who the killer was, this film. So, it made it a lot more thrilling to watch. Plus, the murderer was a lot more creative with the kills, in this movie. That was one thing, missing in the previous three installments. It felt like, in those movies, the slash and dices moments were use too repetitive. Also, I know, it's a bit nitpicking, but how in the hell, does the murderer travel around, so fast and knows where everybody is? Does he have teleporting powers, now or something? It's just seem odd. Despite that, the characters/victims in this film, were a lot more likable, as they were given a little more character development here. Seeing some of them, get hack off, left some emotional impact on me. However, I would like to see, more recurring characters like Tommy's older sister, Trish (Kimberly Beck), Chrissy Higgins or better yet, Ginny Field (Amy Steel). After all, 1982's 'Friday the 13th Part 3' was supposed to center around in mental institution to which she'd been committed due to emotional trauma. However, actress Steel declined to return, and the concept was shelved, until now. Yet, the psychological aspect of the film still didn't work for me. All of the flashbacks and dreams used in the film, seem more cheesy than scary. The film was originally written to have Corey Feldman as the star, reprising the role of Tommy Jarvis. However, he was already working on 1986's 'The Goonies', therefore the script was rewritten to have Feldman's appearance limited to a cameo. Still, John Shepard acting was alright for the most part. He really challenge, mentally disturb, well. I also, love the secret changes that they did with the music cords of the 'Friday the 13th' theme song. It was a great nod of foreshadowing. The ending twist of the film was a bit disappointing, but you kinda knew it was coming. Overall: I have to say the movie is mediocre at best. Not awful, but not good. In the end, it's no movie to really die over for.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

50,paulclaassen,The death of a franchise.,1,15 October 2021,"Oh, what have they done?!! This ""new beginning"" might very well have been the final nail in the coffin for this franchise. The box office takings significantly dropped from the previous films, and the series actually never recovered after this.A few years have passed since the events of the last film. Tommy, who killed Jason in Part 4, is now all grown up, but in a mental institute. Corey Feldman makes a cameo as Tommy, before the film jumps forward in time, with Tommy now being played by John Shepherd.There's a lot more humor here and big parts of the movie plays like a comedy. Some of the characters were so silly and slapstick, I couldn't wait for Jason to get rid of them! The kill scenes are quite boring. You always know who is going to be the next victim. These kill scenes felt like the writers were sitting around a table discussing how they could kill the next victim in inventive ways. There is no pattern or logic. There's so many characters just for the kill that they don't even show all the killings - only the discovering of the bodies. The film also has no suspense whatsoever. Then again, only the first film were suspenseful.The film hardly has any character development. Tommy, who is supposed to be the film's protagonist (I suppose; it's not clear), only features here and there in the movie. Or could Pam (Melanie Kinnaman) be the protagonist? Oh, whatever... She has such an annoying scream, she'll never pass as a scream queen!Oh, and wait for the twist reveal at the end, which caused the franchise to dig its own grave. And I'm going to give SPOILERS here, so stop reading if you don't want to know. There is NO Jason Voorhees in this movie!!! Nope, the killer is a cop who dressed up as Jason and goes on a killing frenzy after his son is killed by a fellow mental patient. Now he avenge the entire camp and everyone who sets foot on the grounds. What the bloody hell?? Just why would a sane man do this, and not only kill the guy responsible for his son's death?? (Or arrest him, he is a cop after all!) From Jason I can understand it, because he's a nutcase, but from a cop!! You seriously messed up this one, Friday the 13th creators!Would I watch it again?

51,tomgillespie2002,"Dull, and seriously lacking invention",3,10 June 2014,"For the first time in the seemingly endless Friday the 13th franchise, A New Beginning betrays the promise of the previous instalment of being the 'final chapter', and has a (spoiler!) non-Vorhees impostor donning the mask, doing the deranged one's good work for him. This has led to this, the fifth entry, being donned the black sheep of the series, and isn't too well-remembered by it's hardcore fans. Being only a casual viewer of a series I believe to be, up to this point, the same movie made over and over again, I have no real problem with this. It's the execution that's the problem, and the laziness of director Danny Steinmann in failing to come up with any inventive scenes of butchery, making A New Beginning easily the most forgettable so far.Tommy Jarvis (John Shepherd, and played by a returning Corey Feldman in one early flashback scene) is tormented by the events of the previous film, and has been released from a mental institution to seek peace of mind at Pinewood Halfway House. It is owned by Dr. Letter (Richard Young), and is home to various troubled and disturbed teens. After the brutal murder of Joey (Dominick Brascia) by Vic (The Return of the Living Dead's Mark Venturini), one of the home's more unstable residents, a series of brutal and unprovoked attacks ignite at the halfway house and the surrounding areas.Chock to the brim with murders, A New Beginning should be the most easily watchable of the series. But lacking a true artist such as Tom Savini, and employing a hack like Steinmann (who only made 4 features in his entire career, including hard-core porn), the film is repetitive and plain dull. Shepherd, it's lead, lacks charisma, so we are stuck with an annoying kid (Different Strokes' Shavar Ross), who although has the energy to carry the screen-time he has, lacks the likability of Corey Feldman and his character. The Scooby-Doo-esque mystery should add another element, but by the time the revelation comes, we've forgotten who the hell it is, and after 90 minutes of endless hacking and mutilation, I couldn't have cared less.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

53,BaronBl00d,What's Not to Like?,1,26 November 2005,"Absolutely everything. This movie is the worst of a very bad series to begin with. We left Jason dead in Part IV, having just matched his wits with FX wizard and pre-adolescent Corey Feldman, affectionately known from here on as Tommy. Tommy now is grown up pretty much and is being taken to a place in the woods for individuals that have undergone psychological problems. We get a very young doctor and his female helper and a group of young teens just waiting to be slaughtered. Of course some of the girls are very pretty and disrobe, there is an obligatory fat kid that has chocolate bars in hand, and there is the feisty presence of little Reggie the Reckless - Reckless to his friends. Nearby are a mother and child reminiscent of The Beverly Hillbillies, minus the humour. This movie just plain sucks to be as blunt as possible. It tries vainly to be funny while it goes through as many killings as possible in ninety minutes. None of the deaths are very interesting - virtually all having something to do with a knife or ax being wedged in a head. There is the obligatory girl in bed scene - in the past four movies always with someone with her having sex. Well, the creative forces that wrote this script change that around just a bit, unfortunately it is just as tiresome as it was before. The acting is abysmal even for this nonsense, and wait until you hear the explanation at the film's end of who and why murder is afoot. I cannot say anything particularly nice about the film other than there a few really lovely young ladies with a very generous spirit and the opening is done somewhat effectively. Once people open their mouths, things go bad. The characters in this movie are completely ridiculous with the weird Ozark neighbors, to the annoying fat kid pressing chocolate bars on everyone, to the two guys dressed like they just got off the set of Happy Days. And how about that Demon character and his girl singing while he is in the metal shack toilet? A real stinker - literally and figuratively. Oh, and by the way, what happens to Tommy? Who cares!",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

56,Fella_shibby,"As a spin off or standalone slasher, this one is pretty good. The settings is very similar to The Forgotten 1973.",6,17 May 2020,"I first saw this in the early 90s on a vhs.
Revisited it recently.
Like most FT13 fans, even I was disappointed since this one doesn't have Jason, the usual woods n Camp Crystal. But aft revisiting, I liked it as a separate film, more of a spin off.
This part doesn't waste time in the flashbacks of the previous installments but picks up years later. Tommy, who hacked Jason in the previous one is a grown up adult n resides in a halfway house known as Pinehurst, a set up which is similar to the movie The Forgotten 1973 where lunatics r allowed to roam freely in the institution located in the rural side. Another aspect similar to The Forgotten is a lunatic is given an axe to chop woods.
It is a decent whodunit slasher with lottuva body count n nudity.Some q's - Tommy's sister from the previous part is never shown, she doesn't even come to meet Tommy who saved her in the previous part.
Their mother's body is also never found.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

58,insomniac_rod,Works without the Friday the 13th title.,5,4 July 2004,"After the infamous brutal ending in ""The FInal Chapter"" everyone thought Jason truly died as it was impossible for anyone to survive. But remember, this is Jason Voorhees, the slasher movies #1 killer, and a mine of gold for Paramount through the Friday the 13th franchise. A year after the ""Final"" Chapter, fans of Jason didn't let him die and a sequel was already on it's way. The result: ""A New Beginning"".*SPOILERS* Tommy Jarvis, the boy that ended the massacre of Camp Crystal Lake by killing Jason took psychological treatment for years after the nightmare he and his sister experienced. Years passed and Tommy was sent to a rural mental institution for a full recovery. Tommy's recognized by the institution managers as the kid that went nuts after killing Jason Voorhees, the Camp Crystal Lake slasher.Tommy is still haunted by Jason; he has constant nightmares about him and he thinks he sees him everywhere. While Tommy tries to make his demons run, the other young patients in the institution seem to get good along and live a ""normal"" life. The next day after Tommy's arrival, one of the patients brutally hacks another patient with an ax. The reason : the victim seriously annoyed him so he killed him. This event started a massacre once again in the nears of Crystal Lake. Everything points that Jason Voorhees didn't die for real and he's back for new victims. Jason sweeps with the institution by killing everyone except for Tommy, Pam, and Reggie. Innocent victims like Reggie's grandpa, his junkie brother and his girlfriend, a man that ""worked"" for a meal, the annoying Demon and his mother, two dumb male teens lost in the woods, a waitress and her lover, found death not even knowing what was going on. Seems that Jason is really mad but something just doesn't convinces the audience this time. Tommy, Pam, and Reggie confront Jason in the end. But, is this our Jason? Doubts raise as Jason is slow, dull, and weak. He's not as effective as in previous movies. After a chasing sequence and a tense confrontation in the barn, Tommy manages to beat his demons and Jason finds his death in a bed of spikes. The killer's identity is revelaed and guess what! (I doubt you haven't seen this movie) Jason is not the killer this time, neither is Tommy, or any other known character. The killer happens to be Roy Burns, the father of the boy who is killed at the beginning of the movie. He murders in the name of Jason copying his look, and methods of killing. Roy's motive for killing is avenge the death of his son by killing everyone in the area, just like Pamela and Jason Voorhees did years before. Jason never became an urban legend as his ghost always wandered in the Camp Crystal Lake area.A NEW BEGINNING could've have worked without the Friday the 13th title. The formula worked once for the franchise when Pamela Voorhees was the killer in the original Friday, so why don't repeat it? It's a straight, decent, slasher on it's own. The killer's identity isn't clear as there are some hints that make you doubt about it.For example, the blue triangle in the trademark hockey mask, the ambulance man's attitude after picking up the rests of his son, his hands were clean before and after killing, and some attitudes that Jason didn't have when he was alive. The body count is high even for a Friday the 13th movie. 21 deaths for Roy's record make him an effective copycat killer. There weren't scary moments, this slasher went directly to the poitn: a slaughter fest.The acting is terrible this time. John Shepherd didn't convince as Tommy Jarvis. I'm sure everyone missed Corey Feldman in this. Too good that in the sequel Thom Mathews (a known actor in the genre) took the role of Tommy. Melanie Kinnaman (Pam)is without a doubt the worst Friday the 13th heroine. Where's Amy Steel? or in the worst case Dana Kimmell?. Reggie's character was annoying and didn't add anything to the movie. I guess that the producers wanted to repeat the formula of a surviving kid but this time it just didn't work. You can't repeat all the main formula events that resulted effective in past movies. Tiffany Helm (Violet) deserves a mention for being the visual attractive of the movie. This girl is hot!. I felt bad for Reggie's grandpa, he was a very nice old man, I wonder if Jason would've killed him. Dick Wieand also did a terrible job as Jason/Roy. Overall, this movie is a mess mainly because it supports on it's back the Friday the 13th title. Fans hate it because Jason isn't on it and that's enough to hate this movie. OK, Tommy is back and the storyline is connected with Jason but it's not enough. We wanted the real and only Jason Voorhees.Almost every die hard Jason fan agree that this is the worst Friday the 13th film. If you're objective, this isn't a terrible movie, it's a decent slasher, effective at least. The slasher elements are here and work perfectly.The best thing about A New Beginning: The opening dream sequence. Excellent stuff for the fans. Corey Feldman's cameo is worth the watch.4/10 On the Friday the 13th scale: 5/10.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
59,Anonymous_Maxine,The worst one yet.,2,12 February 2004,"Contains Spoilers! The movie starts out with a nightmare that Tommy Jarvis is having. You remember Tommy, played by Corey Feldman in Part 4, evidently he's grown up to a fabulous future as a mental patient. Thankfully, this was a dream, since it features two nutcases whooping and hollering as they dig Jason out of his grave, where he is buried under about 3-4 inches of soft dirt, and apparently buried wearing his hockey mask and with a stabbing weapon in each hand. Brilliant. Tommy awakens on the way to the mental hospital, around which most of the rest of the movies revolves.In the movie's defense, at least it wasn't yet another slopfest about a lot of teenagers going up to the lake to be rebellious and end up getting killed just like we already knew they would. They are running out of inventive ways to cut up young people for that to drive yet another Friday the 13th installment. Unfortunately, they seem to have decided that since they added a few new gimmicks to the movies, like a mental hospital, a Jason impersonator, and some shockingly dirty rednecks, they didn't need to come up with any new death scenes. Not exactly the most intellectual necessity, but creative deaths are about 85% of what has always driven this series, and in this one we get more of the same boring killings - a machete pushed through the stomach (on two separate occasions in this movie, I think), slashes across the chest/face, etc. In one scene, Jason plunges a pair on hedge-clippers through some poor girls eyes, but then they screwed it up because we get a shot upwards of his hands holding the clippers and roughly pushing them together, indicating that he had beheaded her. Then we see her and she was just stabbed through the eyes. Why include that shot if it's completely wrong as far as what he did to her?At any rate, the nutty people who inform the cast that they're all doomed are rather interesting as the above-mentioned dirty rednecks, except they run up to the cast when they're at the mental hospital surrounded by police (to find out why you have to watch the movie yourself), and they run up screaming threats, upset that there is a mental hospital filled with punk teenagers so close to their home. Pretty funny scene, except the woman threatens to kill the next person who comes near their house, then she expands her threat to include the police officers, then she informs the lot of them that she is currently strapped with dynamite and would blow them all to hell if they don't watch their step. Just so you know, if you threaten to even punch someone and there is a police officer within earshot, consider yourself arrested. A verbal threat is assault, and can land you in jail. This woman threatened to kill the kids, the police officer, and then to blow herself up, killing everyone in sight, and the cops just smile as she jumps on the motorcycle with her nutcase son and rides off with him, taking with her the dynamite and any respect I might have had for these cops.
Later on, we see these rednecks at home as she is chopping up a chicken, screeching all the while, to feed to her idiot son, and they are approached by a man who knocks on the door, asking if they have any work he can do for some food (he hasn't eaten in two days), so she puts him to work cleaning out the chicken coop and then he can come back and get his stomach filled. Why was this guy in the movie at all? He literally serves absolutely no purpose other than to inform the audience that these people have a chicken coop that needs cleaning and so that he can be another person for Jason to kill. If they didn't think they had a large enough cast of teenagers for Jason to plow through, I would have suggested just adding a few more characters rather than adding in some wandering oddball in a wife-beater looking for a meal. Instead we have this guy with no part in the movie except that of a hungry victim.(spoilers) One of the two most ridiculous scenes in the film concerns her son, who gets beat up down at the mental hospital by Tommy, so he rides home on his motorcycle, screaming that those damn kids made him mad. Rather than going inside to express his anger to his mother, this ridiculous moron rides around the yard on his bike, spinning doughnuts and doing wheelies and screaming at the top of his lungs all the while, flying recklessly around the yard until he either slams into a tree, killing himself, or gets beheaded by a butcher knife that pops out of the bushes. We get the latter, but either would have been satisfying enough, as long as it shut that idiot up. The second of the two most ridiculous scenes in the film is the one where Demon, the older brother of one of the younger but more prominent characters in the movie, takes turns singing `Hey baby baby' over and over to his girlfriend on the other side of the craphouse wall. VERY romantic. On the other hand, what the hell else would you expect from someone with a name like Demon? I guess this was the only thing they could come up with I order to make Demon get concerned when his girlfriend stopped singing back to him. His death, however, was among the more interesting of all of the ones in the movie.Thus brings up a rather important plot point about this movie, that the killer in the hockey mask is not even Jason, but Jason being impersonated by someone, whose identity and motives are revealed at the end of the film after his pretty impressive death scene. Fans might be disappointed that it's not even Jason in this movie, since he was killed in Part 4, but that doesn't really matter for the most part, because even though it's really just some guy doing all the killing, he is still just as relentless, stolid, and basically impervious to damage as the original. He makes no sounds, doesn't run, and of course can't be killed until enough people have been killed to fulfill an hour and a half running time. This should have opened up a lot of possibilities for the movie, since the last time there was any element of mystery was in Part 1 when the real killer was not Jason Voorhees but his mother, seeking revenge against the kids who brought about the death of her son. But nope, the only mystery is that the killer is not really Jason, who the films makers decided to leave dead for this installment (viewers at the time of its release were probably expected to expect some sort of `Evil Never Dies' resurrection very soon to follow), but the ham-handed hints leave all but the most dense viewers very aware of the killer's real identity long before his mask ever comes off.This is surely one of the most hated of the Friday installments among the series' fans, most likely because the real Jason does not appear, but only in name, almost. For the entire film except for the scenes that hint at the killer's identity and the scene where his mask comes off at the end, he is the real Jason. He acts and moves exactly like him, so the basic attraction of the movie is there, I suppose, but it reminds me of the popular failure of Halloween III, the one which completely departed from the premise of the first two films, having absolutely nothing to do with Michael Meyers or Laurie Strode. They wisely returned to the original story in part IV, even going so far as to attach the subtitle `The Return of Michael Meyers' and put a big picture of his mask on the movie's poster. The next Friday film does exactly the same thing, adding on the subtitle `Jason lives,' as though to say, `Sorry about that last movie! He's alive in this one!' I love the subtlety of these movies.So this movie is probably considered by many people, such as myself, to be the worst installment in the series, but not only because it wasn't really Jason as the killer. That's probably only about 90% of the reason. The other 10% is things like the ones mentioned above. Logic is abandoned even more than in the other movies (Tommy, for example, is admitted to a mental hospital that not only exists in the exact location of the cause of his mental instability, but also allows him to keep such things as the horror movie masks that he made as a kid and, shockingly enough, a four-inch pocket-knife), a guy is introduced who has no part in the movie or the series other than to get killed, etc. But I think it remains a curiosity piece, in that it is so clearly an experiment by the filmmakers to try something a little different, have it fail miserably, and then promptly return to the general formula in the next movie.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
60,jzappa,Why Even Make A Movie If You're Going To Make One Like This?,1,3 October 2006,"Of course we've all seen this one before, because it's Friday the 13th, right? The Friday the 13th series is just something most movie buffs have seen, and so we know all the clichés and everything, but let's stop and think here. This one in particular doesn't even seem to know how to be a bad slasher movie. It starts out like a bad slasher movie, then takes a little bit of time being an almost mentally handicapped 1980s teen comedy, then starts to think it's a creepy horror movie, like we're supposed to wonder whether the killer is really Jason or not, then it's a slasher movie again, but by this time, we've seen more than anyone needs to see. We've seen something that could even be considered to be detrimental to the mind. Is it? I mean, everything about the film-making is intrinsically wrong, except the musical score which is just bad, but at least it's not wrong. The script is just wrong. The acting is just wrong. And the direction is so lazy that there is absolutely no way we could think it's scary. The camera, the people, the placement of things, the make-up, the overall look, they're all breathless. Even bad slashers even have some director who likes to have fun with the camera and the editing, thinking he's going to make it as some impressive new visual auteur, which he more than often doesn't.What's most aggravating about this movie, if we can really call it that on account of how little any viewer, movie buff, or even the filmmakers themselves really care about it, is that it's a slasher film that doesn't want to admit it's a slasher film. It's under the delusion that it's a horror film, so it thinks it's automatically becomes scarier if something bloody isn't shown, so right when something halfway interesting does happen, we're deprived of the good part: the gore.God, this movie sucks.

While Jason Voorhes is out of commission, a copycat fills in the void. Yes, ""Jason"" does everything, stabbing, slashing, slitting throats. Yet, the horror factor in the movie is very weak. Using a vacant grave-site is original, and attacking troubled teens is not surprising. Tommy was Part 4's hero when he took Jason's machete, and hacked him good and dead. Now it's years later, and he stills feels haunted by Jason's presence. Unknowning to him that Jason is really a local guy who's taking advantage of his murderous wiles. Shavar Ross was known as Arnold Jackson's buddy Dudley on ""Diff'rent Strokes"" plays one of the troubled teens who gets attacked by the fake Jason.

The local authorities are mystified because they believe that Jason's dead and buried. But Tommy doesn't think so.

64,jadavix,"The weirdest ""Friday"" - with the most nudity",7,14 April 2019,"""Friday the 13th: A New Beginning"" is the weirdest entry in the series. The first three entries were notable for their extreme formulism. The fourth one, if you ask me, was the best, perhaps helped by the fact that it left Camp Crystal Lake and gave us a group of people who were more interesting - and it had a great ending. Who could forget Corey Feldman disguising himself as Jason?Anyway, ""A New Beginning"" also throws the formula out, to the extent that it feels like it was made up as they went along. There is an extraordinary, out-of-nowhere scene of violence early in the movie, that I was convinced had to be a violent day-dream of one of the disturbed characters but... wasn't. It may be the only time someone dies in a ""Friday"" movie who wasn't either 1. killed by the main bad guy or 2. the main bad guy.The ending has a bizarre twist which is made all the stranger by the way the movie seems to purposely under play it, as though they knew the audience wouldn't by it, so they trot it out surreptitiously. It wouldn't surprise me if most of the audience left the movie thinking they had seen Jason at it again.It has quite a bit more nudity and even a pseudo-sex scene, but in typical American style, this is kind of blink-and-you'll-miss-it. They show you boobs, but not for long.The movie also has Tommy Jarvis (the Corey Feldman character from the previous one) all grown up as a young man, despite the fact that he was Corey Feldman's age only a year before?

The storyline surrounds Tommy Jarvis years after the last film after he's recently released from a mental facility. When people start dying around him again he heads back to Crystal Lake to confront Jason, or the person responsible for the murders, directly. This movie is directed by Danny Stienmann (The Unseen and Savage Streets) and stars John Shepherd (Bless the Children), Dominick Brascia (Evil Laugh), Juliette Cummins (Slumber Party Massacre), Jere Fields (TJ Hooker) and Bob DeSimone (The Concrete Jungle). The storyline for this pics up nicely from the previous film and does a good job keeping the audience guessing on the killer. Loved the intro of this movie which actually sets up the next movie perfectly if you watch them close together. I also appreciated Corey Feldman sprinkled in here and there.

68,drqshadow-reviews,Friday Without Jason is a Bland Day Indeed,2,17 October 2016,"With Jason dead and buried (and, shockingly, remaining that way) the series shifts its focus to a Pennsylvania halfway house. Here, a dozen years in the future, we find Tommy Jarvis: young survivor of the last Vorhees killing spree, now fully grown and grappling with mental illness. The intention must have been to freshen the stagnant franchise, but that effort goes no further than a change in location and the mysterious identity of a new hockey-masked killer. We're still stuck with the same basic plot, and though the frequency of kills has gone through the roof, the level of originality has not. Almost every method can be traced to an earlier picture (where it was undoubtedly performed with more finesse) and, most times, there's no rhyme or reason behind the means of execution. Perhaps the bloodiest work came in the editing room, as an X-rated early cut led to countless deletions: the resulting quick-cut camera-work often makes it tough to surmise what's going on and ruins the pacing of many scenes. It's saddled with a flood of pointlessly one-dimensional characters, fuel for the bloody fire, who come and go like shoppers at a Black Friday sale with nary a whiff of development. The soundtrack reaches new lows, impressive given how inept earlier entries were in that department. And perhaps most damning, an awful bait-and-switch fakeout spoils the climax. Pathetic filmmaking, through and through. Is it any surprise the director/screenwriter never worked again?",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
69,Foreverisacastironmess123,"""Man, you are one scared cat!"" Trashiest of all the Fridays, but still fun, just about!",7,13 July 2018,"Ok so while this definitely isn't a favourite of mine in this film series, I wouldn't exactly lump it with the worst ones either - has nobody seen Jason Goes to Hell around here?! For the most part it plays like your basic Friday the 13th outing, but it's decidedly dull and off-putting somewhere too, and doesn't have any real suspense of horror ambiance to it, it just has a strangely offbeat and obnoxious tone running through it that really doesn't gel with the overall feel of the previous four movies. I was never particularly bothered by the whole imposter Jason thing that so divided a lot of fans on this one, I don't think the idea worked out very well but I do think it made for a nice change of pace in the, by this point tired Jason formula and if nothing else, made for a unique entry in the series. I find it a bit of a creepy notion that someone could take on the murderous spectre of Jason in the depths of their rage and grief, and there are similarities between Jason and Joey, although I doubt very much the director was aware of them. There are some things about the shaky plot that just don't add up though, like why didn't bland boring Roy the killer medic masquerading as Jason just immediately go after Vic who he knew had killed his backward son, instead of killing the other innocent housemates and random people who had nothing to do with anything? I never loved these pictures for their logic but it's just plain nonsensical. It's strewn with really weird, tacky touches, like the overly voyeuristic sex scene in the woods, and the two 50s looking greaser boys on their way to god knows what, a poor guy getting offed while taking a dump, and especially the horribly over the top grubby hillbillies who are so cartoony that they feel like they're from a different movie and really bring this one down, I hate those two! The old bag was mildly amusing because of her potty mouth, but the 'actor' who played Junior was unbelievably annoying, you'll never be happier to see a man get his head lopped off while riding a motorbike in a horror movie! And I'm afraid that I really never liked the actor who played Tommy, he just seems stuck up and cold to me, I think the guy believed he was doing shakespeare or something.. Shepherd was intense and everything, but he was also dead boring, he's meant to be the lead but he barely stands out. At least the other actors looked like they were having something of a good time with it. His Tommy isn't a memorable one and is just a strange transitional period between Corey Feldman and Thom Matthews. Now little Reggie the Reckless was a character that I did like and was rooting for, what a cool energetic kid, he brought a lot of fun to the movie, and that goes for Miguel Nunez Jr who was so effortlessly entertaining to watch that he so deserved a bigger part than what he got. And I know it's par for the course with all Friday movies, but with this one it's quite glaringly obvious that people are showing up purely to die and up the kill count, with the most gruesome one being when the beautiful naked girl gets the shears shoved into her head and snapped shut, which is one of the most viscerally brutal kills out of all these movie, bravo on that one! And for whatever reason one of the scenes that always stuck with me was when the waitress is killed outside the diner. I don't like how she gets an axe to the gut but I love that shot! The way she's lying there with the neon lights on her looks really cool and stylish to me, very 80s.. One of the best kills doesn't even involve Jason, it's right at the beginning when poor dumb and hilariously oblivious Joey gets an axe in the back just for trying to be nice! It's funny but also tense and chilling. The whole killing spree kicks off because of a chocolate bar but it still all makes for some fun schlocky 80s slasher goodness in its own right, just not as much fun as a lot of the others. It was an oddball stepping stone between the strong finish of part 4 and the tongue in cheek undead shot in the arm the series needed with part 6, and it's 7 damn enchiladas out of 10 for me yo!

The movie focuses on some people who are living at a halfway house that is near Camp Crystal Lake (of course) that exists for troubled, out of control teenagers. Then, suddenly, one by one, they begin to meet very gruesome fates at the hands of the maniacal legendary killer, Jason Voorhees, who has returned to wreak more bloody havoc on helpless teens. Or is it really Jason this time? Maybe... or maybe not.Another generic ""Friday"" sequel that offers nothing new but an utterly bizarre twist-ending, ""A New Beginning"" is one of the weaker sequels in this series. The storyline is the same thing as the others, only this time our line-up of teenage victims consist of a bunch of out of control brats (which makes the audience even less sympathetic for them). Really nothing new to the genre or the series, but it does offer a few creative murder sequences and a small handful of some clever little scare scenes. But other than that, I can't recommend much about this one.Most people assume that since this is a ""Friday the 13th"" movie, that Jason is our villain. Right? Wrong. So as it unfolds, turns out that Jason isn't even the killer in this movie. The man who the audience thinks is Jason is shoved off of a barn, and dies on some farm machinery. His mask comes off, and guess what? It's not Jason! Instead, the writers of this movie decided that Jason should turn out to be some crazed guy who decides to use Jason's M.O. and start offing some teenagers out in the woods. This movie was alright up until the end, when this horribly-constructed ""twist ending"" is revealed. The idea is ridiculous, there was absolutely no point to the entire movie after the ending is revealed to the audience, it seemed like this was just thrown in as an attempt at a plot twist that really made no sense.Bottom line - this movie would have been decent had that seriously unnecessary twist ending not existed. I consider myself a fan of the ""Friday the 13th"" movies (although the original is miles and miles better than the films that followed), but this one wasn't really necessary. It's only purpose was to add one more sequel to the never-ending series. My main question is, why even make a movie in this series and have the killer end up not being Jason? It makes this movie seem pointless once the credits roll. 3/10.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
72,hu675,"This unnecessary sequel to ""Friday the 13th"" is surprisingly watchable under the circumstance.",7,27 September 2006,"It has been years now... that Tommy Jarvis (John Shepherd) is now on his late teens. He also has painful memoirs that he is one of the survivors of the dark rampage night of murderer Jason Voorhees. Tommy is been sent to a remote sanctuary. Tommy's unforgettable recollection are coming back, when one of the troubled patient murders on naive young male. Then bizarre murders are happening again and someone could be serving as a Copycat Killer.Directed by Danny Steinmann made an suspenseful horror film that also tries to be a mystery thriller and it works at some certain tense scenes. Which it seems that the director and the writers tried to make something different in the series like ""Halloween 3:Season of the Witch"" but the movie is quite unimaginable at times, gruesome and more disgusting than the previous four ""Friday the 13th"" pictures. Also has it's share of unintentional laughter. Steinmann probably experienced plenty of studio interference with this one, because it's shows on film. Although Die Hard fans of the series, truly loved the atmospheric opening with Corey Feldman back playing an young Tommy Jarvis and the strange, intriguing if questionable closing sequence.DVD's has an terrific anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) transfer and an fine-Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono Sound. DVD's only feature is the original theatrical trailer. The Box Set from the ""Friday the 13th"" series has brief interviews with director:Joseph Zito from Part 4 and actor:Feldman talking about the script, where the series could have went with the Jarvis character and Feldman wished that he could have played the lead in this one but fortunately or unfortunately as Feldman put it, he was busy with ""The Goonies"". Still, this one from the series is fairly watchable and it was a modest box office hit. This is truly the black sheep of the series. Watch for Richard Lineback as a Police Deputy, Richard Young as a Consulor (Best remember for ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" in the opening sequence as the archaeologist/adventurer who gives the young Indy his hat) and comedian/actor:Miguel A. Nunez Jr. as a Victim in small roles. Only for the dedicated fans only. (***/*****).",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
73,JoeKarlosi,Friday the 13th V: A New Beginning (1985) **,5,19 January 2011,"At the time of PART 5's theatrical release in 1985 I was a bona fide F13 follower, never missing every new installment on its premiere weekend. So I'll never forget the dazzling disappointment I felt while seeing this fifth one, which back in the day felt like a complete rip-off, just some hackneyed attempt to continue the saga even though the famed hockey-masked killer Jason Voorhees was declared definitively dead at the end of the last movie (THE FINAL CHAPTER). This lame script was a desperate gasp to concoct any explanation under the guise of ""A NEW BEGINNING"", in order to quickly make a followup and keep the box office dollars coming in -- it's got very little imagination and it still shows even today. We have the young survivor of Part 4, Tommy Jarvis, now a few years older and trying to re-adjust at a mental home with other troubled teenagers. He experiences hallucinations stemming from his earlier encounter with the deceased maniac Jason, and he is depressed and mopes around a lot. As played here by John Shepherd, Tommy is a bland and empty character. But right after Tommy's arrival at the institute, both kids and adults are being murdered by a masked lunatic wielding all sorts of weapons in the style of Jason Voorhees' M.O. -- so is Jason back from the dead? Has Tommy Jarvis flipped his lid and taken over? Is someone else trying to imitate Jason's reign of terror? Is it all just a dream? The eventual answer will leave you unimpressed whatever way, and any chance at mystery is shot because it becomes rather obvious.Even taken on its own terms, Friday 5 is a little too over-the-top and frustratingly stupid, with irritating characters (""Ma"" and her loud-mouthed, mentally deficient son ""Junior"" being the worst) and God-awful dialog and amateurish ""writing"". The teenagers in this installment are the most under-written and uninteresting of the whole lot thus far. By this time, the Motion Picture Association Of America was severely sinking its own editor's knife into the elaborately staged slaughter sequences, and so while there are plenty of killings in this offering, they're all pretty bloodless and staged more suggestively due to the demands of the censor. ** out of ****",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

75,Witchfinder-General-666,A Dorky Friday in The Loony Bin,3,31 July 2009,"***BIG SPOILERS!*** ""Friday The 13th: A New Beginning"" is regarded by some as the absolute low-point of the series, and it is obvious why: First and foremost, there's no Jason, just a copycat-killer. Second, this is easily one of the silliest and illogical films in the series, and logic generally isn't the strong point of the series. I am not a big ""Friday"" fan in general, and have always regarded this very repetitive series as dreadfully overrated by some of my fellow Horror fans. While this fifth entry to the series is easily one of the worst Jason films, at least it isn't boring though.Although made in 1985, one year after the fourth part, ""The Final Chapter"" (right), ""A New Beginning is set 10 years after the events in the fourth part. The film takes place in an open mental institution that is supposed to help teenagers with psychological problems re-enter normal life. Tommy Jarvis (played by Corey Feldman as a kid, by John Shepard as an adult), the boy who brought Jason to his well-deserved end in the fourth part, is still suffering from the trauma caused by this fateful night. Soon after he enters the facility, a likable handicapped man is axe-murdered by a psychotic fellow resident (for the record - handicaps and mental disorders are not even remotely the same thing, so I wonder what the victim was doing there in the first place). After this grueling event, a copycat killer begins butchering people, imitating Jason's favorite butchering-techniques...Compared to other entries to the series, the murders in ""A New Beginning"" are quite gore-less; the camera almost always fades away from explicit detail, and shows merely the dead corpses AFTER the murders. As it is the case with some of the other Friday films, the slightest suspense is significantly lowered by annoying characters. This film is even more illogical and full of ridiculous moments and stupidities than most other ""Friday"" parts. Some stupid 'highlights': An exaggeratedly stereotypical redneck lady living near the loony bin clearly hates the lunatics living there, even though her own nutjob son is obviously a lot weirder than any of the mental patients.A guy who looks like Little Richard and his girlfriend are singing a duet while he is taking a crap (the lyrics of the song are: ""Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby,..."").The buddy-like head of the institution gets worried when the residents stay out too long; however, he responds very lenient to spontaneous violent outbursts, and doesn't seem terribly touched when one of them gets killed.A grandfather has no problem with his little grandson making a trip through the forest only with a hot young woman and a patient as company, when it is quite clear that a maniac is on the loose.One of the residents, a chick with terrible makeup, spends most of her time doing a ridiculous robot-dance...All characters are annoying and painfully stereotypical, the (oh so funny) redneck family and the hysterical central character Tommy are particularly unbearable. From the beginning it is quite clear who the murderer is. The ambulance driver, who happens to be the deadbeat father of the butchered handicapped guy, looks terrified when he sees the corpse and obviously wanted to avenge his son by acting like Jason (?). It isn't clear why he would suddenly care after not taking care of his son for years, nor is it explained why he has an actual photo of his son and knows what he looks like after leaving him as a kid. Neither does it make a lot of sense that he would target everybody (including his dead son's friends, and random people who had nothing to do with his son's death) EXCEPT for the guy who killed the boy. Overall, ""A New Beginning"" is easily one of the stupidest ""Friday"" films, but it's not the most boring one. It actually somewhat entertaining in a (really) silly way. I would only recommend it to hardcore Friday-fans (I'm NOT one of them), and many of them will probably dislike this one due to the lack of Jason.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
76,aidanratesmovies,"Oh lord, yes, its really that bad",1,4 July 2020,"Messy, often pointless, and incredibly silly- Friday the 13th Part V is a large missed opportunity and incredibly incoherent mess of a sequel. John Shepherd does give his all as the character of Tommy, and Melanie Kinnaman gives a fine performance, but besides them, the film is often full of absolutely dreadful actors and performances. Every character it a trope, stereotype, cliche, or something incredibly thin, it's actually quite impressive how horrible the writing of the characters can be. Not only are the characters such a mess throughout, but the dialogue and often pointless scenes throughout are incredibly hilarious of how simply bad they are. It's simply a mess, there is little to nothing of any good quality to the film, and I would be perfectly fine never seeing a single minute of the movie ever again.My Rating: 1.3/10.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

Sorry to let you in on the secret if you haven't seen this piece of garbage of a movie, but Jason is nowhere to be found in this movie. Although there is some gore, it is far from anything great. The story lacks anything that the previous 4 movies had and the special effects are very limited. In the end, this was a bad idea that should not have been made into a movie. The opening alone made you question what was happening, since it did not have anything to do with the previous 4 films.

78,a_chinn,No Crystal Lake and barely any Jason,2,28 May 2017,"A low point for the the overrated horror franchise is minus Jason for most of the film and doesn't even take place at Crystal Lake. The story picks-up from the previous film with Jason coming back to life and then possessing Corey Feldman's character, Tommy Jarvis. The story then time jumps years later with Tommy now much older, seemingly carrying out Jason's murderous impulses in a story that's attempting to be a psychological horror thriller, but fail miserably. Not that the prior films showed restraint when it came to nudity, but this film was pretty gratuitous in it's overuse of sex and nudity for no really purpose. And although this film probably has the highest body count of any of the films thus far, the killings are not particularly interesting or clever. One star for a kind of interesting opening prologue, but this film is clearly the worst of the series.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

80,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,There's nothing to get out of it anymore,2,29 January 2017,"It's one thing when a franchise becomes successful because of a formula. It's another to repeat that formula into submission and bring nothing new into the equation. The original Friday the 13th (1980) was not spectacular storytelling but it did captivate its audience with a character's mysterious past. Sure it was ripping off John Carpenter's Halloween (1978) but it was a flattering gesture towards it. Friday the 13th Part II (1981) although not exactly keeping its continuity together, managed to continue the story of Jason Voorhees to some degree. Friday the 13th Part III (1982) lazily rehashed the concept again. The only thing making it pop out was literally all of its 3D gags it had to offer. Friday the 13th Part IV: The Final Chapter (1984) attempted to bring fresh blood to the table but ultimately did nothing new at all. What exactly was this series trying to accomplish? There has been no story development on Jason Voorhees since the second sequel. Apparently nobody saw the downhill slope this franchise traveled because it happened again.Picking up several years after the last entry, Tommy who killed Jason Voorhees is now grown up (John Shepherd) but still scarred from his encounter with the masked assailant. After being relocated to a more liberal asylum that allows its patients outdoors owned by Pam (Melanie Kinnaman), people begin dying off again and Shepherd thinks Jason has returned. While this occurs the local sheriff (Marco St. John) thinks Jason is around as well although there are several other suspects that could be doing the killing, including a crazy neighbor named Ethel (Carol Locatell). As much as this could be interesting because almost all the characters are mental patients, nothing is ever done with them. The screenplay was written by Martin Kitrosser, David Cohen and Danny Steinmann, who also directed. One would think someone would know what to do with these characters, especially Martin Kitrosser who wrote for Friday the 13th Part III (1982) and Friday the 13th Part IV: The Final Chapter (1984). Not one character gets the attention they deserve.Corey Feldman who played Tommy from the first film is credit as appearing. He's only in one scene and that's it. This doesn't develop the current state Tommy is in. All audiences will get is that Voorhees haunts him. Why? No reason is given. John Shepherd as the older Tommy barely says anything and at one point vanishes for a good portion too. Assisting Pam attend to the patients is another boy named Reggie ""the Reckless"" played by Shavar Ross who doesn't add much either. He's probably the most likable of the cast but he's not given much to work with. Melanie Kinnaman as Pam is another waste of time. All she does is show up for the finale pretty much. There are a bunch of other cast members to the list but none of them stand out because they are by the numbers fodder for the killer. None of the dialog is witty, clever or memorable at any level. If Danny Steinmann wrote for Savage Streets (1984) and Martin Kitrosser was the script supervisor for big budget productions that belong to Quentin Tarantino like Pulp Fiction (1994), why isn't that quality here?Even for gore hounds this film is a disappointment. Understandably the first submission to the MPAA was bound have cuts but this entry barely shows a thing. All other films before it had some level of explicitness to it. Here, much of the kills are off screen hardly showing a thing. It's not that entertaining when characters are so poorly written and all a viewer is betting on is how good the violence will be and it's not even shown. There's a nice scene where Jason Voorhees gets attacked briefly but in the end it doesn't make a whole lot of sense either. Playing Jason was stunt man Tom Morga. This was Morga's only time playing Jason and for how he portrayed the character it was okay but nothing distinguishable. Many times its just Morga holding his machete up in the air for dramatic effect. Morga is better known for doing stunts in numerous films such as Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982), Ghostbusters (1984), Police Academy 2: Their First Assignment (1985), The Texas Chain Saw Massacre 2 (1986), and Spider-Man (2002).The cinematography by Stephen L. Posey is possibly the only real credible aspect to this picture. Not a whole lot works here but Posey manages to at least keep the picture looking somewhat decent. When the shots are during the daytime, the picture is clear. Even the shots during the night hours have decent lighting so the viewer can see what is going on. Posey has done work on other horror films like Bloody Birthday (1981) and Slumber Party Massacre (1982). Shockingly not even returning composer Harry Manfredini's film score could save this entry. Although the full scores did not receive different treatments in themes, fans could always rely on Manfredini bringing back the iconic sound of the original film. Oddly enough Manfredini did not do that. The main theme sounds in the same vein as the original but sounds very sloppy this time around and it's a bit off putting. The assumption could be that because the title had ""a new beginning"" in it, Manfredini needed to make a slightly new theme? Why bother though, if a sequel is this bad, keep the good stuff.Camera-work is adequate for the entry but nothing else is here. The actors and their performances are as forgettable as they come. The music is bizarrely different from past film scores despite it being the same composer. The story doesn't make sense and the gore almost is non existent.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

82,PredragReviews,"""This is a small town! And small towns are supposed to be safe!""",7,6 October 2016,"The scares and seriousness are starting to wear off with ""Friday the 13th: A New Beginning"" and instead we have something a little more comical, a little more campy and a little more entertaining. Now none of these films have ever been high art or considered serious horror. However it is obvious with this film the writing is weaker, the performances are weaker and the effects are weaker. Yet it still manages to be fun and watchable. The killer's identity (using Jason's mask and machete) is predictable. The script could have been better if it were re-worked and more red-herrings had been thrown our way to keep us guessing.The acting by the cast is horrible and the script wasn't thought out all that well. There are however some hilarious comedic moments now and then in the movie. It's one reedeming quality is the acting portrayed by John Shepherd as Tommy Jarvis. The portrayal of Tommy as a seriously disturbed young man after his encounter w/Jason is very realistic for it shows the constant fear, anger, sadness and paranoia of surviving that horrific night from ""Friday the 13th part IV"". Some pluses were the settings they used which were used effectively. The infamous rain storm, the woods, the barn and the final chase scene near the end are all on nice display here. This movie really had a lot of potential but fell short in what could have been the best in the series since the original.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
83,Sandcooler,Not as soul-crushingly awful as you've heard,6,20 September 2016,"""A New Beginning"" is often seen as the biggest failure of the entire ""Friday The 13th"" franchise. It still did okay at the box office, but it was universally hated by critics and fans. The main offense was that the series tried to establish Tommy Jarvis as the new villain, taking over killing duties from Jason. This idea was so misguided and unpopular that the following sequel actually had to be called ""Jason Lives!"" just to let everyone know they weren't going through with it. Is the movie really that awful? Not really. The story is a mess, but the movie is genuinely entertaining and the opening scene is actually pretty creepy. The movie's also laced with some bizarre, dark humour. The following sequel went for slapsticky humor and parodies, which I could appreciate. This one somehow uses the death of a mentally retarded teenager as comic relief, which might somehow be better. ""A New Beginning"" certainly isn't the worst of the franchise, though the experimental story hurt it tremendously.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
84,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,"There is little ""new"" about it",7,6 May 2004,"Tommy Jarvis, the little kid that hacked Jason up into pieces at the end of ""Friday the 13th The Final Chapter"" is now a teenager, and still haunted by the memories of Jason. He's sent to a halfway house out in the middle of the woods, and another series of killings starts and Jarvis can't understand if it is Jason back again from the dead or not, or if he is just losing what's left of his mind. This one rips off a lot of its story from ""Psycho II"", but it's still a decent continuation of this series - even though Jason Voorhees IS NOT IN THIS MOVIE AT ALL. Apparently the producers were going to have Tommy Jarvis being driven insane (after all that had happened to him in part IV, and seeing what turns out to be an impostor in this film) and continue the series with him as the killer instead of Jason. When they changed their plans, Jason was resurrected in the next movie, ignoring the fact that in this movie they say that he was cremated.The two biggest problems with this film is that, for the first time in the series, it's just not *scary*, as the earlier entries were, and the story is trying to be a ""guess the killer's identity"" plot, but the killer's identity is obvious - he might as well be holding a neon sign over his head. If it isn't the medic, Roy, then why do they filmmakers keep showing him, with an evil, sinister look on his face, at the cleanup of every murder? (An interesting clue occurs when, as Demon (oh, please) is killed in the outhouse, scrawled on the wall behind him is the old WWII phrase, ""Killroy was here"".) About the title: first of all, the on screen title is ""Friday the 13th A New Beginning"", there is no number five in the title. Secondly, there is something visible underneath the ""Friday the 13th"" logo after it blows up at the start, I don't know if it's posts that the sign was standing on or a defect of the film stock itself or what? Speaking of the film stock, the entire film has a dull and lacklustre look to it throughout; was there a different film stock used in this, than the earlier films?

And so were the producers for thinking this was a good way to continue the franchise.",3,2 September 2016,"Oh, boy. Look, I know it's popular to pick on this particular entry in the franchise and label it one of the weaker efforts. And I generally like to form my own opinion instead of following the popular consensus. Hey, I'm the guy who tends to be lenient and like the silly flicks other people love to hate. I'm the guy who enjoyed ""Van Helsing"" and thought ""The Adventures of Pluto Nash"" wasn't THAT bad, for Pete's sake!But even I have my limits, and while I do think the hate for ""Friday the 13th: A New Beginning"" is a bit overblown... I'd still venture to say it's easily my least-favorite entry in the franchise. It's a mish-mash movie of jumbled ideas, attempting to both sequelize the series while performing what could best be called a ""soft-reboot."" But it peaks VERY early on, doesn't quite come together, and suffers a very lackluster and head-scratching finale that leaves you shaking your head in mild disappointment.Tommy Jarvis (John Shepard), the troubled surviving hero from Part IV, arrives at Pinehearst, a treatment facility for teens. Things seem like they may be looking up at first, but after a bizarrely abrupt and random act of violence at the facility (hint, hint, this is where the movie peaks because it's so hilariously insane), things quickly turn dark and soon after, a new hockey-masked killer emerges. Could it be that Jason Vorhees has returned from the grave? Has a new figure taken over where he left off? Or is Tommy really just going crazy?Who knows? ...who cares?It's really fascinating. The most persistent rumor about 1984's ""The Final Chapter"" was that the series was ended because the producers and executives behind the scenes felt somewhat embarrassed by the series, and wanted to get rid of it. Yet, only a year later, this was released as an obvious cash-grab to milk more money from the franchise. It's funny because this is probably the most embarrassing entry in the series. It lacks the far-out humor (intentional or not) of later installments, but can't quite be taken as seriously as the previous ones. It's just a jarring entry in the series that doesn't quite fit in, especially because of the somewhat contrived ""mystery"" aspect questioning whether or not Jason has returned from his seemingly definitive death or if Tommy's gone nuts. (Or both? Or neither? Again, who cares?)Really, the less said about this weird side-excursion in the franchise, the better. It's not going to win over any new fans. And old fans will either love it or hate it. Though the general consensus decidedly falls into the later when it comes to that.This is a sub-par 3 out of 10. It earns a few courtesy points for a few stand-out moments (like I said, the random act of violence in the beginning at the facility is brilliantly over-the-top hilarious in all the wrong ways), but it's one that even hardcore fans can skip.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

It's sort of like the Halloween 3 of the series just alot better mostly because the film still delivers on the tropes that are expected. This time around young Tommy is grown and he is crazy and fine. Still traumatized from the events of the last film he's been put in a house for troubled youth by Camp Crystal Lake (like that makes sense). He's also learned self defense and is still into FX. Well a killer emerges after one of the clients is brutally murdered by the ultra hot bad boy Mark Venturini of Return of the Living Dead. The paramedics come to pick up the pieces and spoiler alert one happens to be his father. His retaliation= He dresses up as Jason and tries to kill everyone. It's a lame twist but the kills are great and the boys are smoking. In the end it's all just overly mediocre and very trashy but it's aged well over the years and is far more entertaining than it was when it initially was released.3/5,Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

89,baumer,Aa shockingly good entry!,7,14 August 1999,"Warning: may be some spoilers, but if you haven't seen this movie, I have no idea why you are reading this review.I like to think of myself as a Friday the 13th purist. I love the first four films in the series and really hate the last three. So somewhere in the middle of that scale is part 6 and this one. And while I have to admit that this one goes against everything that is Friday the 13th, it is quite entertaining, funny and so improbable and impossible ( even for a Friday movie ) that I enjoyed this one immensely. Maybe not on the same level as the first four, but quite a bit nonetheless. You just have to get past the premise and the ridiculous idea of the killer in this one and you too may be able to enjoy it.First of all, it has to be said, Jason is not in this one, and if you pay attention to the tag line ( If Jason still haunts you, you are not alone ) then you'll know that he's not. But some idiot takes up his legacy and decides to kill everyone because he sees his son lying in a body bag. And if you can't figure out who the killer is then you really aren't paying attention to ""subtle"" shots in the film. When Jason is first introduced, we see a shot of the guys leg and hands and it looks like the guy is standing identically to the way he has in all the other films. Then there is a scene where the sheriff mumbles to himself and the same guy that turns out to be Jason says "" You talking to me sheriff? "" For no particular reason. So to be fair, on that level, the film is really stupid. Not to mention the fact that the guy that turns out to be Jason is probably about 5'10 and maybe weighs 200 pounds ( he is a little rotund ) where as Jason was probably 6'5 and 240. So the attempted similarity there is incorrect as well. Then there is the fact that this guy can do the things that Jason did. He can shatter doors just by plowing through them, he can take a chainsaw in the arm and still keep fighting like he was impervious to pain. So let's recap Jason here. He is the undead. He is perhaps spawned by Satan himself. He has been killed too many times to be counted and then resurrected and he is the personification of evil. This Jason is an ambulance attendant. Enough said.But having said all that, I have to admit I had fun watching this film. I was far from scared but I was very entertained. The film is actually quite well done in many aspects. One of them is that it does stay true to the Friday the 13th legacy as there is a high body count and if the sensors hadn't of gotten a hold of it, it would have been much gorier.As strange as this is to say, one of the strengths of the film, is the characters. Tommy Jarvis is all grown up now and is the quiet and psychologically tormented teen that is at a halfway house for reformed kids. John Shepherd is actually a very good Tommy Jarvis. He did have a career in Hollywood after this film and he shows he can act here. I enjoyed Tommy as a quiet, psychologically tormented teenager. I also liked the complete over the top characters "" Ma"" the biker chick and her dimwitted redneck son. I liked how one guy shows up in the middle of the film for no reason, with no name and no purpose in the film except to die a short time later. I thought Pam was sexy, especially when she wore no bra on a stormy night while wearing a white see through blouse. Vic made me laugh because he was just p****d at the world and Joey was funny too. One of my favourite characters is Damon. He meets an untimely death in an outhouse, which is a Friday the 13th staple as well. Many people have died just after doing their business and not properly cleaning themselves afterwards ( remember Harold in the 3rd and also Chuck in the 3rd ).Friday 5 is not a true Friday the 13th in the sense that it has no Jason, but it is fun and it is worth a laugh and it has atmosphere. It is worth seeing and I think if you can sit back and just think of this as 90 minutes of fluff, then you'll have a good time watching it. It is much better than 7,8,9 but pales in comparison to the first 4. Still there is just something fun about the whole thing. It doesn't have the edge of the third and fourth, but it is done well enough in many areas for many of us Friday the 13th nuts to get some enjoyment out of it. 8/10",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
90,DunnDeeDaGreat,The worst in the series(some spoilers),3,26 April 2002,"Friday the 13th: A New Beginning is the worst in the series due to the lack of the orinigial Jason Voorhes. The film starts out with a good opening sequence but than goes downhill from there and don't get me started on the ending, how could Jason's best for the very cool Tommy Jarvis make a choice like that ? Skip this one and go to part 6.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
91,hnt_dnl,The franchise with zero continuity,5,26 October 2021,"I've been binge watching the Friday the 13th series during Halloween month and something I'm realizing is there is really little to no continuity to this franchise. The ending to the first film is still confusing to this day. Alice was in the boat and got seemingly pulled into the lake by Jason, yet the cops at the bank didn't see it somehow? So Alice only dreamed of Jason being alive, yet somehow he WAS alive in Part 2. Ending to Part 2, what happened to Paul? Ending to Part 3, why did Chris dream of Mrs. Voorhies dragging her in the lake when she didn't even know who Jason actually was? If she didn't know of him, how could she know of his mother? Part 3 does actually logically extend to Part 4, but then there's the timeline discrepancies with some of the movies jumping years ahead but never acknowledging that it's later than the year the movie was made.Out of the first 7 movies, this one A NEW BEGINNING (1985) is actually the only one that I had never seen before and had zero clue what it was about. It's ironic that I had never seen it because as it turns out this movie is basically now an alternate reality/different timeline that never happened. You can skip Part 5 and just go from Part 4 to 6, which is exactly what I did years ago, having ZERO idea of Part 5 being an outlier. In A New Beginning, which takes place some years after Part 4, Tommy is a deeply disturbed teen sent to some backwoods school for troubled teenagers. Unlike the Tommys in Parts 4 and 6, the one in Part 5 (excellently played by John Shepherd) is borderline mute and very strong. In fact, the movie toys with the idea that TOMMY is the one actually killing people since every time Jason appears, it's only in his imagination and the Jason from Parts 2-4 is clearly dead at the end of Part 4. The ending of the movie implies that Tommy is the new Jason as he is about to slash the blonde final girl who co-ran the teen center.The whole point of A New Beginning is that Tommy is pushed over the edge into becoming a serial killer due to his nightmares of Jason and this copycat killer going around killing the people at the center. But that idea didn't fly with the fandom. They wanted Jason, not Tommy, as the Friday the 13th killer. And this is why the franchise diverged into virtually sheer comedy starting with Part 6 immediately succeeding this movie. I have to say as I'm re-watching these movies, I'm finding that the odd-numbered ones seem to be be better than I remembered and the even ones worse. Part 5 being an odd one (in more ways than one) makes me see that the fillmakers actually had a good idea with making Tommy turn into Jason 2.0 and it would have been more interesting to see where the series goes after that than 5 more movies of Jason being un-killable.In fact, I'd say that John Shepherd's performance as Tommy in Part 5 is arguably the best performance of the entire series, but will always be overlooked because of the general campiness and silliness of the franchise. Corey Feldman will get more credit as the original Tommy for being Corey Feldman and the one from Part 6, who is just a typical 80s pretty boy, will get credit for being in a supposedly better movie. A New Beginning is definitely not great or even good, but credit the director for trying to go in a different direction from the standard inhuman slasher trope, which is where all the rest of the movies went.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

Not a single moment induces suspense at all, I doubt seriously the director knew at all how to direct (this is his last effort listed, not surprisingly), it's got none of the Friday spirit, it's horribly acted, incredibly predictable but yes, it does have a surprise ending, THAT SUCKS.Granted, these Friday films are no masterpieces of cinema, but at least they entertain. Some are reasonably suspenseful and you can basically count on some gore and nudity. There's none here at all. Although the series has it's fair share of idiotic characters, this one is beyond belief. There's one actor who seems to be good, so what to do; use him as little as possible.I really don't like this film, it's without a doubt the worst in the series and should be avoided by anyone except completists.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

This has a repeating theme throughout of introducing a character then almost within a matter of a few minutes killing them off, which is refreshing change from many other slasher movies that hold off the slaughter until the very end. The killings themselves are not anything that hasn't been done many times before, but there are plenty of them, and some of the characters are really quite funny, almost cartoon goofballs that cannot be taken seriously at all. This isn't the worst slasher ever, it's just too enjoyable for that, but it's still a silly, poorly plotted/acted, throwaway B-movie.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
97,TOMASBBloodhound,One of the lesser early efforts in this series.,3,28 June 2012,"The fifth installment of the popular series is certainly one of its worst. The acting, writing, and directing all leave much to be desired. Though there are some interesting killings, there aren't enough to save the contrived plot.From very early on, we see some logical lapses that raise a red flag about the quality of the material. First of all, after Tommy Jarvis arrives at the half-way house, we see him take a large pocket knife out of his bag. Now do you really think an unbalanced mental patient with a history of violence would be allowed to carry anything like that? Would the staff at the mental ward he came from not have searched him for such weapons daily? Next, we see a squad car pull up to the facility carrying a couple of trespassing teens back to where they belong. One thing that struck me was the fact that the lights and siren were blaring as the car pulled up. Now, would the police have really needed to use the lights and sirens just to bring the two kids back? Not at all. There are plenty of lapses in logic like that throughout the film. How about after Vic chops up his victim? He's sitting in the back of a squad car with not one drop of blood visible on his clothes, yet look at all the blood on the sheet covering the body! As the story unfolds, we see numerous murders take place. Is Tommy Jarvis the killer? If there was anyone who saw this film and was surprised that Roy was really the killer, then I pity them. The screenplay couldn't make that fact any more obvious. From the ghoulish look on his face when he sees his son's body, to the shot of him closing the ambulance door after the sheriff says ""we've got a maniac out here!"", it's pretty obvious that Roy is our killer. I have no problem with them trying to put a twist in the formula like that, but they could have at least tried to make it a little more difficult to figure out.The film sinks to deplorable lows by having most of the victims be troubled (or in one case completely retarded) kids. Some of the victims are just innocent people caught in the path of the killer. I felt terrible for poor old gramps and that homeless man who are killed for no reason at all. There is gratuitous nudity at every turn, as well. I think the only cast member I recognized was Dudley from Different Strokes.Perhaps the most interesting thing about this film is the fact that not one, but THREE writers are credited for the screenplay!!! It took three people to come up with this??? I notice that one of them (Martin Kitrosser) works with Quentin Tarantino now as some type of a script supervisor. I guess you have to start somewhere.Overall, there are much better films in the series.This one is worth about 3 of 10 stars.The Hound.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
98,jluis1984,The Underrated One,6,7 December 2005,"Those who have seen the original series of Friday the 13th movies (Parts 1 to 4) know that before Jason was the mindless unstoppable zombie of the recent movies, he was a human that apparently was killed by Tommy Jarvis in Part 4, ""Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter"".""Friday the 13th: A New Beginning"", the fifth movie in the series is a different take on the ""Friday"" franchise turning it into some kind of mix between a slasher and a ""whodunit?"" mystery.Tommy Jarvis (played by John Shepherd) is taken to a foster home in the woods after being released from the mental institution where he recovered from the trauma of having his family killed in the events of ""Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter"". After one of the kids in the foster house gets brutally killed by another of the kids (Victor, played by Mark Venturini), bizarre killings begins to happen and Tommy starts to believe that Jason is still alive, but who is that possible? Who is killing people? Is it Victor? Tommy? or Jason? The story looks promising, and for the most part is well handled. The twist ending is very surprising but the explanation is kind of weak, which is one thing the fans complained. The movie has a good amount of suspense and while maybe not as gory as the other movies, it has a good amount of mystery surrounding Jason that keeps you thrilled until the end.The acting is kind of weak in the lead characters Tommy and Pam (Melanie Kinnaman), but the supporting cast is actually good and better than the leads. In fact, that is probably the reason of why by the middle of the movie the story focuses more in Reggie (Shavar Ross) than in Tommy.To summarize, this take was not very well received by fans, but I find it is unfair to dismiss it just because of the weak explanation of the twists it has. In my opinion, if they had followed the direction that the ending of this one takes, the ""Friday"" movies would have recovered that atmosphere of suspense that previous movies had, instead of the gratuitous mindless violence of current incarnations of the franchise.A different and vastly underrated take on the series: 6/10",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
99,ivo-cobra8,My favorite underrated a good Friday the 13th horror slasher film,10,24 September 2017,"Friday the 13th: A New Beginning is very underrated and a really good horror film. It is my sixth favorite Friday the 13th film. It grew on me Friday the 13th Part III 3D and this one really grow on me and they become my favorite films. I am big Friday the 13th Fan and I love mostly of the films. This is the good movie. I know it get's a lot of hate because it doesn't have a Jason in it, but Tom Morga who played the hockey-masked killer was fantastic. It has good kill's and it is really my favorite 80's horror film. This movie reminds me on The Blob (1988) the diner scene my favorite horror sci-fi film.I love this film this time around the fourth time in the row it become guilty pleasure of mine. Melanie Kinnaman was a good bad-ass heroine, she was good and her performance was decent. The dinner scene was a fantastic death scene. Rebecca Wood as Lana was a good victim and I like the death kill. When the killer beheaded that biker guy Junior it was a good kill I like it. Tom Morga was a fantastic hockey-masked killer. Juliette Cummins as Robin was a hot great sexy babe. I like her as a victim. I like this film it is an alright slasher film not that bad.Danny Steinmann R.I.P. who is no longer with us anymore. I respect Mr. Danny Steinmann and his vision of the movie what he was trying to do. Please my remorse goes to his family and rest in peace Danny you are really missed. You have my respect Danny Steinmann you were great director and your direction of this movie was solid and your writing ability for the screenplay was talented.Melanie Kinnaman as the blond Pam was good excellent heroin I loved her. I love that in this movie the hockey mask design in this movie fro the killer was blue. I love in which Pam fights off The Killer with a chainsaw really awesome climatic battle fight scene.I have enjoy this film and however I feel now it is better then Friday the 13th Part 2 because the killer wasn't so clumsy and the chainsaw worked in this movie. Just like the first movie it ravels about revenge. In the original film is Mrs. Voorhees and this movie has Roy paramedic the killer. I still love Part 2 to death but it does have confusing plot.Friday the 13th: A New Beginning grew on me and I didn't thought it was horrible. I still don't like John Shepard as Tommy Jarvis but the movie more revolves around Pam and Reggie which I like. It is a good horror film. A 10/10",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
100,eminkl,Is it any surprise the director/screenwriter never worked again?,2,18 April 2020,"With Jason dead and buried (and, shockingly, remaining that way) the series shifts its focus to a Pennsylvania halfway house. Here, a dozen years in the future, we find Tommy Jarvis: young survivor of the last Vorhees killing spree, now fully grown and grappling with mental illness. The intention must have been to freshen the stagnant franchise, but that effort goes no further than a change in location and the mysterious identity of a new hockey-masked killer. We're still stuck with the same basic plot, and though the frequency of kills has gone through the roof, the level of originality has not. Almost every method can be traced to an earlier picture (where it was undoubtedly performed with more finesse) and, most times, there's no rhyme or reason behind the means of execution. Perhaps the bloodiest work came in the editing room, as an X-rated early cut led to countless deletions: the resulting quick-cut camerawork often makes it tough to surmise what's going on and ruins the pacing of many scenes. It's saddled with a flood of pointlessly one-dimensional characters, fuel for the bloody fire, who come and go like shoppers at a Black Friday sale with nary a whiff of development. The soundtrack reaches new lows, impressive given how inept earlier entries were in that department. And perhaps most damning, an awful bait-and-switch fakeout spoils the climax. Pathetic filmmaking, through and through.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
101,fernandoschiavi,"The premise is interesting, but everything from story development to Steinmann's weak direction makes the viewer wish the series really ended in the previous chapter",5,7 September 2021,"Despite the fancy scripts and the lack of aesthetic quality, there is no denying the influence of the movies from the Friday the 13th series on the history of horror films. A landmark of the so-called Second Golden Age of Horror, Jason may not be sophisticated like Hannibal Lecter, or smart and shrewd like Freddy Krueger, but he's certainly leveraged the taste for cinema for an entire generation. Anyone who survives Jason Voorhees's attacks has only one fate: madness. That's what happened to Tommy Jarvis, the boy who mutilated Jason at the end of Part Four. The killer is really dead. His remains are buried in a graveyard in Crystal Lake, while the boy is plagued by increasingly realistic visions that show Jason threatening him with death.In the introduction, we no longer have a summary of the final minutes of the previous film, but a nightmare of Tommy Jarvis (or is it a premonition?) where he (as a child, played by Corey Feldman) witnesses two young men unearth the body of Jason (who is with a mask and a machete in tow) until they were brutally murdered. When he is about to be attacked, Tommy wakes up, older (now played by John Shepherd), being taken to an institute for the mentally ill and disturbed teenagers. This institute is a farm where treatment consists of preparing patients for their return to the real world. It's not a hospital, it doesn't have bars or guards. Silent, Tommy tries to adapt to the place and live with the gang of delinquents who are there and who follow the stereotype of the characters that have appeared before in the series: the fat stranger, the young people who only have sex, the rebellious and funny, the weirdos and even a boy, who is only there to visit his grandfather.Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning follows the bold idea of not having Jason as an antagonist, even recalling Paramount's initial idea of making an anthology. As admirable as the concept is, this is easily the worst movie in the series so far. The plot begins a few years after the previous one, with Tommy Jarvis (now played by John Shepard), deeply tormented by his bloody encounter with Jason Voorhees as a child (with the features of Corey Feldman, who makes a point) and being sent to a mental clinic, located - you guessed it - inside. Tommy suffers from visions of the killer, which make him take violent and aggressive actions against everyone around him, and suspicions grow even greater when a series of murders that follow Jason's pattern begin to occur throughout the region.At first glance, this fifth movie seems like the ideal way to reboot the franchise. Without the physical presence of Jason Voorhees (who appears only in Tommy's visions), the script by Martin Kitrosser, David Cohen and director Danny Steinmann starts from the interesting premise of finding another killer to fulfill Jason's legacy, and all that. Text has been building since the beginning - in fact, since the impeccable climax of The Final Chapter - is that Tommy Jarvis will be the new killer of the franchise. It would have been a fascinating move, but unfortunately the text chooses to tease the viewer and go for a completely nonsensical solution to the killer's identity, ignoring what could have been a clever construct. The final scene even tries to recover it, but the damage was already done at that point.Worse, we have the most incongruous and ridiculous setting in the franchise so far. The producers really don't get away from the idea of pervert teenagers in the middle of the forest, but they don't seem to understand that this concept doesn't fit with the idea of approaching a psychiatric clinic. In fact, none of the characters there (with the exception of the cartoon Dominick Brascia) seem to have some kind of mental disability, as if the trio of writers had simply put a hospital in just to ""avoid repetitions"". Well, it wasn't a successful task, and none of the characters are the least bit interesting, and we still have an unnecessary supporting core with two characters who take the trashy white hillbilly stereotype to the extreme, played by Carol Locatell and Ron Sloan. Of course, being a coarse woman and a spoiled adult son, the two serve as an amalgamation of Pamela and Jason Voorhees; on paper, since nothing in the grisly performance or portrait of the two yields any kind of analysis. Maybe just little Shavar Ross as Reggie, who follows the former's wise decision to put smart kids up against the killer - and I find it hilarious how Reggie has a brother (Miguel A. Nuñez), who looks inexplicably identical to Prince - and the fact that he sings in one scene only reinforces the comparison.Jason is not the current killer. Who kills here is this Roy, who, oddly enough, has so far the best move for Jason in the entire franchise. He doesn't run and isn't agile like the ""Jasons"" of the four previous films. He feels pain, bleeds and walks slowly Michael Myers style. Unfortunately, this is the only quality of Friday the 13th - Part V - A New Beginning. In an attempt to give the series a new direction, they opened several holes in the script. The main one is the murder motive. Roy does not kill the madman who murdered his son, but all the creatures that cross his path. If the intention was to avenge the death of the young man - whom he never recognized as a son - why didn't he kill the madman who committed the crime? Why take revenge on the world, if what is most responsible for the boy's disability is precisely his negligence? Joey was a mentally challenged young man who appeared to have been abandoned at the clinic. After he died, no relatives had come to see his body and his father acted as if his son were a stranger. So the man freaks out and decides to go out and kill everyone? That's the most clueless reason in the whole series.And even though this movie doesn't have the real Jason, the killer dresses like him and has the same modus operandi. And even though he's an ordinary human, he can appear everywhere (without running), have super strength and a bunch of completely irrational actions. Tommy is another one who is lost in this story and disappears for a long time for a small comeback at the end. The script doesn't even have the luxury of explaining what happened to his sister Trish.Furthermore, several characters are murdered without any influence on the story. There are a couple of lovers (a waitress and a jester) who receive violent axes, but who have never appeared before; the guys who stop on the road to fix the car.... Not counting the biker mother and son who die for no reason, just to show more blood. Despite the high number of victims, the film is not that violent. The deaths are repeated all the time: there are several attacks in the stomach, throats cut, head cut off, face crushed..., but without the necessary effects to impress. The two most interesting deaths: that of the boy whose skull was crushed by a belt in a tree; and another who dies with a flare in his mouth.In terms of direction, this must be the weakest and unimaginative Friday the 13th. By keeping much of the plot shrouded in the mystery of who is committing the murders, Steinmann's decoupage always hides the antagonist's face, returning to the old technique of the first films. But if we had the voyeuristic and uncomfortable POV there, here Steinmann limits himself to presenting close shots of the murderer's hand with some weapon, machete or garden shears, and the result is more embarrassing than frightening. Also, it's expected that in the fifth movie of the series we'd be fed up with chases inside barns...A New Beginning was a failed attempt to breathe new life into the franchise. The premise is interesting, but everything from story development to Steinmann's weak direction makes the viewer wish the series really ended in the previous chapter. It's a disappointing film because it brings another villain that doesn't quite reach the icon Jason, even though the story is a sequel to the previous film, he tries to give an autonomous identity to the franchise which ended up making this a continuity that didn't quite right. Accepted by the public. Nobody would want to see a Friday 13th Part 6 with Tommy as the assassin replacing Jason, so they went back and brought Jason in for the next part.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

I will never understand the hate for this movie. Still haunted by his gruesome past, Tommy Jarvis - the boy who killed Jason Voorhees - wonders if somehow he is connected to brutal slayings occurring in and around the secluded halfway house where he now lives. This is a story about a place most people might not be able to conceive. Fortunately the director lets the actors breathe and the music lets the atmosphere live.

104,acidburn-10,Not The Best In The Series,6,13 June 2007,"The fifth part in the series, which in my opinion is where the downfall started in the series. Don't get me wrong it's not the worst in the series but it's bit of a disappointment compared to the first 4 parts.The plot takes place a few years after part 4 where Tommy's now in his late teens and still traumatised from the events in part 4 is sent to a mental institution in the woods and yet again Jason turns up and starts killing people, but Jason is dead so who is the guy in the hockey mask going on a killing spree could it be Jason risen from the grave or is it someone else.Friday The 13th part 5 is also when the acting quality started to go downhill, but it still delivers the goods like the teens getting butchered, having fun and sex. So part 5 isn't all bad. I know a lot of people weren't pleased with is the fact that Jason isn't the killer in this one but a copycat the first and last time a copycat was used in the series, well to be honest I thought that this wasn't a bad idea something different and new to bring to the series but the fact that the copycat killer wasn't much of a mystery I basically figured out who it was within the first ten minutes but I thought he did a pretty good job but nothing compared to the legend Jason.Although most of the characters in this movie aren't as developed in the first four movies, because given the fact that there were way too many and plus they didn't do much apart from get killed. But there were some characters I did enjoy like Ethel and her son Junior who I thought were very entertaining and quite funny and was also glad when they were killed off, and the new Tommy this time played by John Shepard did a bang up job playing the troubled youngster and also his kung fu moves were awesome.The acting, like I said John Shepard did a bang up job a real solid performance, Melanie Kinnaman (Pam) well she was cute but she was one of my least faves in the entire series she weren't very convincing during the final climax scene. Shavar Ross (Reggie) he did well in his role I especially liked the tractor part but his screams were annoying, Violet (Tiffany Helm) is great as the punk chick, Robin (Juliette Cummins) was underused, Tina (Debbie Sue Voorees) had nice breasts but no acting skills as did the geeky kid with the glasses the one with the stutter didn't do much and Richard Young (Matt) brought nothing to the film his character was almost pointless.All in all this movie is bit of a let down compared to the first 4 parts but it still delivers the Slasher ingredients like great deaths and lots of them and attractive ladies getting they're kit off.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
105,Darkside-Reviewer,"""There's a man with no life in his eyes""",5,29 July 2020,"Friday the 13th: A New Beginning was the fifth entry to be released in the Friday the 13th franchise. The previous entry Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter released just one year prior to this movie in (1984) was meant to be the final movie in the franchise which had ended the movie with Jason Voorhees character being killed off but because the movie made such a profit at the box office making $33 million dollars (US) against a $1.8 million dollar (US) budget of course there had to be a sequel.Friday the 13th: A New Beginning is most considered by fans to be the worse movie in the franchise and it's not hard to see why. This was the first movie in the franchise that noticeably toned down the blood and violence although the movie is still considered to be pretty violent but in comparison to the earlier entries in franchise it feels lacking. A lot of the kills are done off screen the ones that are kept in the movie are heavily edited to show as little detail as possible most of the blood and gore is shown when the victims body is discovered by other characters in the movie and even then is only shown for a breif moment. To try and distract from the lack of blood and gore this movie shows more gratuitous nudity than in any of the previous movies but this didn't win over fans or critics who panned the movie as just a cash grab sequel by Paramount.An interesting fact had the movie been a success the movies producers had the idea in mind of turning the Friday the 13th franchise into an anthology series where each movie would be focused on a different killer donning the Jason Voorhees mask. The setup for this idea can been seen at the end of the movie which shows the surviving Tommy Jarvis put on Jason Voorhees mask and as the screen fades to black he raises a knife up behind one of the character heads and the movie ends. This ending along with the idea of a future anthology series was scrapped in favour of a sequel which would bring Jason Voorhees back from the grave to kill more unsuspecting teenagers, fight a psychic with telekinetic powers and take a boat ride to Manhattan.I still recommend watching this movie if your a fan of Friday the 13th or just a fan of Horror/Slasher movies in general and while this isn't the best entry in the franchise it's still entertaining and bloody and dispite what people say it's not that bad of a movie it's not even the worst Slasher movie released in 1985 not by a long shot.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

More of the same, bored characters, a strange score with a touch of the original music, some good murder scenes and a nice twist at the end, this part five is fine enough but at the same time is weak.

108,TalesfromTheCryptfan,Not that bad people!,6,8 September 2009,"Years after Tommy Jarvis (John Sheperd) killed Jason Voorhees for good, he has been sent to mental facility to one other home where he is now placed in a halfway house for troubled teens as he tries to get rid of the painful memories of Jason. A fat patient named Joey (Dominick Brasca) who annoys the other patients and one of them named Vic (Mark Venturni) hacks him up then gets arrested. However things may look safe at the haven for Tommy as he befriends a young boy named Reggie (Shevar Ross) who is the grandson of one of the workers. But unfortunately a killer is on the loose in the town but is it really Jason back from the dead or someone in his footsteps? Considered by fans as the worst of the Paramount Friday The 13th movies, this one isn't that bad as they said it was. This movie was originally considered a new beginning after Jason died in the last movie and the makers wanted to make the series into something different with a new killer in each installment which is kind of similar to ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" in concept of a different horror movie in each installment. Fans of Jason rejected this idea and wanted the goalie back and they got their wish with the next installment. This part of the series co-stars a cameo by Corey Feldman and even has Miguel Nuenz Jr. of ""Return of the Living Dead"" fame which should surprise fans of the horror genre.There's a lot of graphic killings in this one as it has a body count of 20 dead people with some good kills of skull-crushings, implements, stabbings and that kind of thing. A couple of sexy naked chicks including a topless blonde waitress who is just gorgeous as hell and of course some twists with turns.Overall it's not that bad.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

112,PeterMitchell-506-564364,"This Jason is still bad, but cheesy fun",4,2 December 2012,"The Friday 13th movies have to be the worst series of movies ever made. Everybody has to die, leaving room for a whole new batch in it's following. That's it, that's it's excuse, film after film after film. Our victims are drunk, sex crazed teens, some responsible, here and there, without a care in the world. And to Jason Vorhees, hideous outcast, this is solely an injustice. It's a constant slaughter, and this fifth outing is no different. It's though this movie has to survive on the slaughter factor to carry it through, only this one has a twist in it's finale, that you'll be gladly appreciative of, if even taking admiration for it. This one is a whole lot of fun, mind you, thanks to it's characters, some of them, really cooky, most of them, mental patients. It's directed by Danny Steinman, who made Savage Streets, prior, so obviously this director is into cheap film making. As seen at the end of part four, a little Tommy Jarvis is left, the only surviving victim of yet another massacre at the bloody hands of Jason. He kills him. That's what we're led to believe. But is Jason really dead? Now in his late teens, still haunted, and tormented, surviving on all different types of drugs, Tommy, a real talk here is sent out to a open psychiatric farm in the country. He tries to find solace, first befriended, or shaken out of his wits by the grandson of the caretaker, who takes delight is popping up and scaring the de Jesus out of the new patients with his masks, but we see Tommy can give his own back, with a grotesquely scarier mask he made himself. Speaking of popping up, the grandson known as Reggie the reckless, is actually played by Dudley, who was Arnold's friend in Different Strokes. May'be this 85 flick was a dead stop for this child actor, who is among a lot of unknowns here, anyhow. The young couple who run the place are well meaning, sort of Christian type people who've had a few run ins with two cooks nearby, an old woman who runs a chicken farm, using the chickens for her soup to feed her immature backward son (sort of flashbacks from Mother's Day here). She keeps going off as two of the mental patients, sex crazed lovers, keep trespassing and doing it on her property, a nice naked sight. The male of the relationship, also learns a valuable lesson about knicking other people's masks. In the wake of a terrible tragedy involving a fat, mentally slow patient, where another axe chopping patient was arrested, a string of murders, begin to happen, not just to mental patients, but a sleazy sex crazed ambo and his woman, plus two unwitting youngsters whose car breaks down, the driver staying in the car, drumming on the steering wheel, while delivering some inventive poetry and song, A RAT TAT TAT attached. His singing career is really cut short. The scene with Reggie's older brother, who has the Michael Jackson hair, and who the grandfather strongly disapproves of, is hunched on the crapper in a little shed box, singing to his girl outside, with her singing back in a continuation of lyrics, and so forth, is a trademark scene. When it finally comes around to doing no twos, he has a real straining look on his face, as he really gets into the lyrics. This itself is priceless. The acting here is better than No 3, thank god. Nothing more I really have to say about this Friday the 13th, but it's one of the more entertaining Friday 13th picks, thanks to it's characters, and it's setting of story, a new beginning in itself. And with the constant slicing and dicing, fans won't be disappointed.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

Tommy Jarvis is sent to some institute place to get over the events from The Final Chapter. Unfortunately for him (and his other horny roommates) Jason is at it again, chopping all the teens up as per usual.Now, I have nothing wrong with a bad 80's slasher, I LOVE the Friday the 13th series, but this is ridiculous. I can only list two good points about this movie:1. There is some nice nudity in this one. 2. The body count is high and the kills are gory and inventive.But there are so many bad points that out way the good ones. The acting is appalling, the music not as good as the previous ones, the characters lamer than usual, the FX at times were very hokey and the hilariously stupid ending.This is an all time low for the Friday the 13th series.½/5",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

There is little going for this installment if you ask me.  There is an absurd number of deaths, horrible dialogue, bad acting, retarded characters (no pun intended...if you've seen the film you'll get it), and just all around dumb. Although, I will admit that they did attempt to come up with a little better of a plot than just Jason running around killing people, but I'm not so sure it worked, and I'm sure some Jason fans felt cheated.I definitely wouldn't recommend going out of your way to see this one.  If you are dying to see the Jason films, then go ahead and watch it, but other than that, I would recommend seeing something else.  In the event that you do see it, I hope you enjoy it.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
115,raypdaley182,Really bad!,1,19 October 2007,"Again as I always do with these sequels I have to start by saying this. Jason Voorhees is dead, he died drowning as a child in the original, all the killings in that were done by his mother who was also killed in that film. So I will not refer to Jason unless in inverted comma's as he is dead.Unlike it's 4 predecessors this doesn't start with a recap but with a very obvious dream with Tommy (Corey Feldman) from part 4 watching 2 men exhume the grave of ""Jason Voorhees"" (which really should be a much smaller grave for a child!) only to wake up as an adult being transferred from a mental institution to a Reform centre called Pinehurst. And the odds of a mental patient being allowed to keep a knife as a possession is zero, OK? The mask adult Tommy uses to scare Reggie is the same mask he wore in part 4 (when his mom told him to get a haircut).Our mental patients are Joey (the fat guy), Vic (the macho tough guy), Violet (the punky girl), Robin (the cute girl), Eddie (an asshole pretty-boy joker), Tina (the slutty girl) & Jake (the stutterer). Staff are Matt (in charge) & Pam (2nd in charge) & George aka Gramps (the cook & Grandfather of Reggie). They are hated by redneck neighbours Ethel and her son Junior.1st dead is Joey (killed by Vic for being annoying), 2nd dead is Vinny (a local wise guy), 3rd dead is his buddy Vinny (another local wise guy). 4th dead is Billy (an orderly from the mental institute), 5th dead was Lana (A waitress & Billy's girlfriend). 6th dead is a drifter whose name we never got. 7th dead was Tina and 8th dead is Eddie (we assume the strap around his head killed him).Pam takes Reggie & Tommy to meet Demon (Reggie's older brother, who I recognised from Return Of The Living Dead) and we also meet his girlfriend Nita. The guy beating up Junior in the long-shots wasn't the actor playing Tommy (he was too tall). 8th dead is Nita and Demon is 9th to die.Pam goes off to look for Matt, George, Tommy, Eddie & Tina. Junior is 10th dead (decapitated in his yard) closely followed by Ethel who is 11th dead. 12th dead is Jake (we assume, never seeing it). Unlucky 13th dead is Robin (in her bed, doing nothing) and Violet is 14th dead (just dancing in her room). Reggie finds all the bodies of the dead patients in Tommy's bedroom. Pam's scream sounds very fake (she's very slow to react) and finally someone dressed as ""Jason"" smashes into the house.Outside on the road they find a hospital van containing an orderly, 15th dead. (Good goof is how The Killer was behind them but appears in front of them by the van without ever passing them) Pam finds Matt's body, 16th dead. She runs back to the house and the body of George (17th dead) is thrown through a window (this has happened in 2 previous ""Friday"" films and is getting old).Pam is chased by the guy dressed as ""Jason"" (the stripe on his mask is the wrong colour, it's blue but should be red) and saved by Reggie driving a bulldozer into The Killer (which would have at least broken his ribs if not killed him). Pam fights & cuts The Killer with a chainsaw and then Tommy finally arrives (so we now know he's NOT The Killer), gets slashed across the chest and stabs The Killer in the thigh with his knife. The Killer climbs the ladder FAR TOO EASILY for a man hit by a bulldozer, slashed in the arm by a chainsaw and stabbed in the thigh.Reggie & Pam work together to knock The Killer out of the barn but it takes Tommy to chop off his hand and The Killer is impaled on a hay-bailer losing his mask revealing him as Roy, the paramedic. Joey turns out to be his son and his death sent him over the edge.The ""Fake"" death of Pam is shown to be a nightmare of Tommy's. His final hallucination is of the real Killer (the mask from the previous film). I find it hard to believe Tommy would have been allowed to keep the mask Roy wore (it'd be evidence, surely?) and there is no way they would have taken a knife with a wounded patient either.The weak ending is supposed to make us think that Tommy's delusions of the ""Jason"" Killer of the previous movie have finally taken control of his mind and he has become ""Jason"".Really awful ending.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
116,jhaggardjr,They lied,2,19 September 2000,"When ""Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter"" came out in the spring of 1984, the producers behind these movies said that it would be the last film in the series (hence the title). Then the movie was a box office hit just like its three predecessors. And guess what? They couldn't resist. They had to make another one. What a bunch of liars! All of the other ""Friday the 13th"" movies that followed the fourth installment were nowhere near as good as the first four chapters, and the fifth installment titled ""Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning"" might just be the worst of the lot. It features the usual: gruesome killings in the most disgusting way; sex scenes along with T & A; young adults doing drugs; and so on and on and on. But one thing that made the first four films good is that many of the characters featured were likable. ""Friday the 13th Part V"" features some of the most obnoxious characters that I've ever seen in movie history. For example, one of those characters is the foul-mouthed Ethel Hubbard, played laughably by Carol Locatell. Here is a character who spends all of her screen time yelling at everyone, especially her dim-witted son who I found just as annoying.

This movie is a nice mixture of exploring that trauma, the way it effected his psyche, and a mother & son duo that are out to get him and everyone around him in an institution designed to help him process his trauma.
Sure, you've got the same old tried-and-true jump scares (some of which are getting quite tiresome by this entry; how many times must a body come crashing through a glass window, and how many times do we need to see the victims removed from their death scenes and placed in areas all too convenient for our naive heroines to discover them?) but this one is really good for story. And there's some pretty nice twists in the plot that I personally didn't see coming.I think in terms of sheer enjoyment, this entry ranks the highest, which is quite impressive for the fifth entry in a slasher series.

The Tommy Jarvis character from the last installment is brought back, though now in his late teens and off to a halfway house as he continues to deal with his Jason experience.  As most have noted, Jason did not attend this go round, but the killer who replaces him has the same talent with sharp objects so nothings lost.  Those who say the killers easy to figure out I dont believe cuz it being a ""Friday"" film I just assumed it was Jason.  Only after the sherriffs explanation and multiple viewings did I realize the identity.  But this is still the best because of body count with over 20 slashed (some in dream sequence) and the way they're done is truly inventive.  Hedge trimmers in eyes, a dude killed in an outhouse, and the most hilarious one, a flare shoved in someones mouth.  And lets not forget the females, like cute heroine Kinneman, brief but gorgeous Sharkey, and titanic breasted Debisue Voorhees.  With all that this would have to be the greatest, but I'd say a majority of the other reviews would be against it. Ya gotta at least like the cast, Shepard as Tommy, Ross as the kid, Pavlon as the stuttering nerd (""I wanna mmmmake llllove with you"" still makes me bust up) and Locatell is a hoot as foul mouthed Edna, to mention a few.

Especially those with SEVERE anger management issues? If they had, then this whole thing would have been avoided (The dad was the ambulance driver, remember? Seeing his son chopped into kibbles and bits drove him a bit over the edge).And another gripe: If the dad was SO angry about his son's death, then why did he desert him in the first place.

Having said that he is not the most annoying character in the film, that honour befalls that redneck, inbred, motor bike riding decapitation victim Billy.The plot here centres around Tommy Jarvis, the character who was played by Corey Feldman in Part Four and who was responsible for Jason's demise. The years have not been kind to Tommy's sanity and he finds himself at a mental hospital that looks a lot like the farm from Friday Part Three.I can only conclude that two of the characters in the movie are only there because they are incurable nymphomaniacs, because every scene they have in the movie is spent indulging their desires, including their murder out in the bush.Anyway, to rate this one fairly, I went back and watched again, and I can honestly say that knowing it isn't Jason from the start really helps you to appreciate this movie for what it is, which is fun 80s schlock horror. Some of the deaths are effective, Tommy's a nice character, and the killer, while choosing a rather extreme form of expression, is not without reason and purpose.Does this movie contain nudity and sex? You Bet! I mention that in every comment of mine because it is one of the most frequently asked questions from people considering movies to rent or buy.But it is a little better than people make it out to be. A film that merits a second look and reappraisal from the Friday fans.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
129,rlcsljo,The most interesting of the series,6,26 December 2000,"This episode in the series had several interesting ""firsts"" for the Friday the 14th juggernaut:  1)  The victims were not for the most part ""ordinary"" teens--but had various mental/social problems; 2) There was a killer other than ""Jason""; 3)  The police knew about the killings, before all the victims had been killed. 4) An indication that ""Jason"" may be more than one person or that there may be more than one ""Jason""; 5)  That serial killing may inspire ""copy cat"" killers.Overall, this was the most entertaining of the Series, and one of the most sexy.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
130,buckikris,""" Blood Is Thicker Than Water""",7,27 June 2016,"Friday the 13Th-A New Beginning is a different kind of sequel. Tommy Jarvis(John Shepard), who is about 17 is being transferred to a halfway house. Years before he was institutionalized, now it's time to get him ready to prepare for the outside world. He is still traumatized from that brutal night with Jason, and very withdrawn. Once he arrives at the half-way house for troubled teens, he meets Matt(Richard Young) and Pam(Melanie Kinnaman). They are the coordinators, who will be helping Tommy and the others. At first Tommy doesn't seem like he will fit in until he meets Reggie(Shavar Ross). When Reggie gives him quite a fright, Tommy begins to open up, and gets Reggie back. Tommy scares the S**T out of him with the masks he makes. Including Tommy there are about 6 others there. Violet(Tiffany Helm), Tina(Deborah Voorhees), and Eddie(John Dixon) are a few of my favorites. Tina and Eddie are the wild ones, they sneak off a lot, and get caught doing the wild thing. Their favorite spot is Ethel's Farm. Ethel and Junior, mother and son, remind me of two redneck crazies.As soon as Tommy arrives, trouble ensues. Joey(Dominick Brasca) is another resident of the house. When he comes out of the house he starts bugging Tina and Violet when they are doing laundry. Once he dirties up the clean laundry he goes over to victor( Mark Ventierini). Vic is one of those loose cannons at the house. While Vic is chopping wood Joey keeps harassing him; all of a sudden Vic loses it. Vic takes the ax and kills Joey with it. When the paramedics arrive Roy(Dick Wieland) freaks out. It doesn't mention this at the beginning, but Joey was Roy's Son.After Joey's Tragedy a killing spree begins. Sheriff Tucker( Marco St. John) believes Jason Voorhees is back. He tries to convince the mayor this, but nobody believes him. As the body count rises, Tommy wonders if he is responsible. He has violent episodes , where he gets mad easily. The first time it showed was with Eddie before dinner. The second happened when he went to the trailer park with Reggie, and Pam. Reggie went to see his brother Demon(Miguel Nunez) and girlfriend Anita(Jere Fields). Tommy wanders off and is confronted by Junior, Junior teases him; and Hell breaks lose. Tommy becomes violent attracting Pam's attention. When Pam observes what is going on, she tells Reggie it's time go. When the 3 return back to the house they discover the carnage; and who is responsible A showdown begins, and the real killer is unmasked. It's Roy, arriving on the scene that day; and seeing his son murdered sent him over the edge. He decided to get revenge; and revive Jason's wrath. He became Jason, he saved the past clippings of the Crystal Lake killings; and disguised himself as Jason.In the end Reggie, Pam; and Tommy survive. Tommy is admitted to the hospital but everyone else seems O.K.. When Pam decides to check in on Tommy, it appears he's escaped? The window is broken, Tommy is nowhere, and it's just eerie. When she begins to close the door, Tommy is behind the door. He is masked and holding a knife pointed at Pam.Even though this movie received poor reviews, I actually likes it. It's a fact nothing will beat parts 1 and 2; but 5 is is far from being the worst. This sequel has comedy, especially Ethel and Junior. One of the funniest is Demon and Anita. The Port-A-Crapper part was comical, especially when Anita and Demon Star singing Ooh Baby. So if Your looking for a horror movie with comic relief this is it. B.T.W. a lot of T&A shots in this one sequel. This film has it all, it reminds me of Halloween 3-Season Of The Witch. The main Antagonist character takes a break from the series; but the movie holds up to become a cult classic.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
131,jcbutthead86,"A Flawed,But Entertaining And Interesting Sequel.",7,30 September 2015,"Friday The 13th Part V:A New Beginning is a flawed but entertaining and interesting sequel that combines fine direction,a good cast,a memorable score and nice special effects. All of those elements make Friday The 13th:A New Beginning while not one of the best films in the Friday The 13th a solid entry in the franchise.Friday The 13th:A New Beginning tells the story of a teenage Tommy Jarvis(John Shepard)still haunted and mentally disturbed by his encounter when he killed Jason Voorhees in The Final Chapter is sent to a halfway house with other trouble teenagers. While at the house some one is murdering and killing people in a similar way Jason used to Tommy and others have to learn how to survive.Stuck between the gory and bloody darkness of the excellent Friday The 13:The Final Chapter(1984)and the entertaining high octane thrills of the brilliant Friday The 13th Part VI:Jason Lives(1986)is Friday The 13th:A New Beginning,one of the most infamous films in the Friday The 13th series(along with Jason Takes Manhattan,Jason Goes To Hell and Jason X)that has divided fans over the years some love it and some hate it but at the same time has found an audience since it's 1985 release. I always liked this twisted film and have a fun time with it despite it's flaws. It's easy to see why most Friday fans wouldn't like this one with no Jason in the movie(except in Tommy's dreams and hallucinations)and the film trying to take the series into a new direction and it works and some times it doesn't. But at the same time all the elements of the Friday The 13th series are pretty much there front and center:kills,gore,tons of nudity and a high body count(one of the highest body counts of the series at 20)taken to excessive levels in this one. We also have hillbillies,Kung Fu Fighting,robot dancing,1950s style greasers,disturbed teenagers,drug use,sex,singing in the bathroom and large uses of the F-Bomb throwing in everything but the kitchen sink with tons of other bizarre things happening in the film. A New Beginning with all of those elements has a sleazy and trashy weirdness as well as an over the top nature to it that feels different from the others in the series that makes it a watchable Slasher whodunit. The kills in A New Beginning while not as creative as some of the other movies in the series are effective and well done in their simplicity. My only problem with the kills is that there was no build up or suspense to the kills and they all seem to happen every 5-10 minutes. But there is still enough suspense and excitement to keep viewers entertained with a good foot chase scene for good measure. As for the blood and gore it's still there but is scaled back compared to some of the other Friday's thanks to the MPAA but there is still some red plasma in the movie. The atmosphere is pretty effective especially during the night time scenes when it's raining and the photography is at times eerie and haunting. What about the main characters? Well,some of them standout(like Tommy,Reggie the Reckless and Pam)while the other characters while interesting are Slasher movie fodder waiting to be slaughtered. The Friday The 13th movies have always had a dark sense of Humor(whether it was intentional or not)but A New Beginning the Humor is hilarious and dark because there are some things that are intentionally funny and other things that you weren't supposed to laugh but ended laughing at anyway(the infamous candy bar scene is a prime example). The ending of Friday The 13th:A New Beginning has been a source of controversy over the years with Friday The 13th fans on whether the ending actually happened or was it all a dream. But I like the ending cause it goes with the rest of the movie and there is enough twists and surprises that would make Scooby-Doo laugh and smile. A fine ending.The cast is good. John Shepard is terrific as Tommy Jarvis,with Shepard bringing the right emotion and depth to the role. Melanie Kinnaman is wonderful and beautiful as Pam,a woman working at the halfway house. Shavar Ross is fantastic and fun as Reggie The Reckless,a tough street kid. Lookout for a cameo by Corey Feldman as Tommy Jarvis,age 12. Richard Young(Matt),Marco St. John(Sheriff Tucker),Juliette Cummins(Robin),Tiffany Helm(Violet),Debi Sue Voorhees(Tina),John Robert Dixon(Eddie),Jerry Palvon(Jake),Dominick Brascia(Joey),Mark Venturini(Vic),Carol Locatell(Ethel),Ron Sloan(Junior),Tom Morga(Jason Voorhees),Miguel A. Nunez Jr.(Demon),Jefe Fields(Anita),Corey Parker(Pete),Anthony Barrile(Vinnie),Bob DeSimmone(Billy),Rebecca Wood(Lana),Dick Wieand(Roy Burns),Caskey Swaim(Duke),Vernon Washington(George),Richard Lineback(Deputy Dodd),Ric Mancini(Mayor Cobb)and Sonny Shields(Raymond)give good performances as well.The direction by Danny Steinmann is great,with Steinmann bringing a good visual style and atmosphere to the film and using things such as close-ups and zooms at the right time. Fine direction,Steinmann.The score by Harry Manfredini is another great and atmosphere score that goes well with the film. Wonderful score,Manfredini. There is also a terrific song by Pseudo Echo(His Eyes)playing during a memorable scene.The Special Make-up Effects by Martin Becker are incredible and memorable and go well with the film. Nice effects,Becker.In final word,if you love the Friday The 13th franchise,Slasher Films or Horror Movies in general,I suggest you see Friday The 13:A New Beginning,a flawed but entertaining and interesting sequel that is worth your time. Recommended. 7.5/10.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
132,shanayneigh,Fatty had it coming,1,8 January 2009,"I've been watching the Friday the 13th movies back to back, and now I've made to the fifth one. Not that the first four are masterpieces, but A New Beginning is one big stinking pile of cow dung.The premise of the story (although ridiculous, but given that it's a slasher) is kind of okay, but everything else about the movie is absolutely horrendous. I know, slashers aren't known for their witty David Mamet dialog, but this has got to take the price. The direction is awful and the effects look like a blind armless monkey on Thorazine could have done a better job (and he probably would have gotten a higher budget too). This movie needed more gore! Instead we get some sort of faux kung fu and what looks like ketchup.I have no idea where the hell they got a hold of these actors - perhaps the porn industry and the 2nd grade school play rejected them - but they're too over the top for their own good. They act like it's a very early rendition of the Wayans brothers Scary Movie, 15 years before the fact. The problem is that this movie claims to be an actual horror slasher.Let's see, who have we got? Mother-and-son backwater hillbilly couple, complete with plaid shirts and dirty faces, both acting like they're total retards? Check. Two bad asses (pussies) in leather jackets, humming on swing and bebop, trying to pass off as Marlon Brando in The Wild One? Check. Fatty stuffing his face with candy, with stains of chocolate all over his face and hands? Check. Skinny black guy, also sporting a leather jacket (and pants!), since that's the universal insignia for coolness, topping it off with rhinestone earrings and Soul-Glo hair a la Coming to America.Want me to go on? Didn't think so.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
133,Rendanlovell,One of the worst,2,20 July 2020,"Wow, this was awful. Might be the worst of the series so far. At this point I'll take any new ideas I can get but this does absolutely nothing with them. I like the looney bin setting, I like tommy jarvis taking a lead role, and I like how over the top every character is. It's supremely goofy in that way. But it also never winks at you. Which makes me think they did not do this on purpose.The movie is a total farce but completely unintentionally. Normally those make for good bad movies but this is borderline unwatchable. It takes itself way to seriously and is amazingly cheap. The entire movie is set in a house and we all know how dull that can be *cough* Childs play 2 *cough*. Not only that, but it's literally the same story again.5 movies in 5 years isn't enough to make them retool the story much. The biggest new element in the story, minus the new setting, is the big twist. I won't say to much, but it makes almost every character unlikable, Reggie being the exception. This cast of characters is by far the worst of the series. They are all annoying in one way or another. They're all a shade of Loud, stupid, gross, or boring. Characters are introduced in one scene to die in the same scene. Characters do things for no reason, it's just a sloppy mess.The worst aspect is easily the kills though. Man, they are cheap and clumsy. Even more so then in the original, which was made on a shoestring budget. This had a huge budget in comparison and yet it's the cheapest looking and cheapest made. Most of the kills are swings towards the camera and then cutting to the person now dead. Just so cheap.Then there's the issue of the main character, of which there isn't. Tommy is in theory but dissapears from the film for a long stretch when Jason finally appears and starts killing. What was he doing? Where did he go? Why did do that? It doesn't make any sense. There is no one to root for, there is no one to like, and there is certainly no one that's relatable.What a truly horrendous film. No one seemed to care about this except the cast, and they are so poorly written it doesn't make a difference. Everyone is a stereotype blow up to absurdity, the kills all suck, and it can barely be classified as a Friday the 13th movie. A few new ideas only go so far when everything else is terrible.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

136,NightmareOnElmStreetFan,Criminally Underrated gets unnecessary hate and criticism - Melanie Kinnaman is outstanding heroine,10,8 September 2019,"Wow I don't understand the hate for this film, I don't get it. Where this hate is coming from? Just because It dosen't have Jason in it you have too hate it? It get's bad reputation. Only few fans like me love this film. Why Halloween dosen't get the hate? Why Sleepaway Camp dosen't get the hate? But this movie which is a decent good slasher film gets the hate! It is Criminally underrated, get unnecessary criticism and hate. They went with a new direction so it is not a bad film. Melanie Kinnaman is outstanding heroine. I love her because she is a babe, I wish we could see her boobs. I love this film to death it is my sixth Favorite ""Friday the 13th"" film in the franchise.Not really the strongest film in the franchise I found it the weakest one in the franchise but still watchable Melanie Kinnaman was one hot babe and great heroine. Melanie was good and her performance was decent. Melanie Kinnaman is the reason to watch this movie. Tom Morga was excellent as the masked killer. Sure this movie dosen't have Jason in it, so what? but a masked killer with an iconic hockey mask with blue stripes was a bad-ass maniac who goes on a revenge murderous spree. Like the first film this one revolves about revenge. It is set in Pinehurst institution in which Tommy Jarvis is delivered. A Young boy is cut to pieces buy a maniac that sets a killer on a revenge spree.Rebecca Wood as Lana was excellent the diner scene was really one of my favorite slasher scenes. Deborah Voorhees as Tina was nude and one hot sexy babe. Juliette Cummins was sexy and hot babe as Robin she was a hot babe. I read that director Danny Steinmann was filming more a porn until later they changed the aspect in to Friday the 13th Part V. I know it has a lot of problems and I know why this film people hate it.My opinion Melanie Kinnaman with a chainsaw against a killer was actually in fact well done executed more than in part 2. In Part 2 i forgot to mentioned that Ginny with a chainsaw against Jason Voorhees was just goofy not well executed a killer was so frighten that I have laugh my ass off. In here the chainsaw fight is well excucted and well done. This is a good slasher film. Corey Feldman appear in the opening sequence as Tommy Jarvis. I love the song: His Eyes by Pseudo Echo not a bad song at all. Tiffany Helm as Violet was dancing I heared that she had to learn those dance moves. because they were difficult to use them.Friday the 13th: A New Beginning is a good slasher film in his own way. I enjoy this film it is my sixth favorite ""Friday the 13th film"" franchise I love this film to death. Better trhan Part 2, better than Part VIII or Jason Goes to Hell even MILES way better than Jason X those movie were not well executed. The main theme from Harry Manfredini was miles way better executed than in the other films. I love this film to death, the kills, the bodies, the gore they are all great effects. Dosen't deserve the hate in my opinion, give it a chance.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

138,Tromafreak,So much for closure,7,7 May 2015,"Every great Horror franchise must come to and end. And for Friday The 13th, that would be part 4. ""The Final Chapter"" arrived in 1984. And a hell of a final chapter it was. The best of the series, some still say. This film had it all. Tits, gruesome kills, Crispin ""the dead *beep*"" Glover. And it was actually pretty scary. But most of all, it gave us Friday The 13th fans closure. So, anyway. By 1985, The greedy *beep* at Paramount wanted another sequel. Preferably a resurrected Jason, or possibly a returning Corey Feldman, taking over as ""the new Jason"". Unfortunately, neither scenario became reality. But this movie was to happen either way. Because Paramount demanded more... of something. The original plan for Friday The 13th Part V was to bring back the kid who killed Jason. This didn't exactly go as planned due to Mr. Feldman being too busy filming The Goonies at the time. But he was available for a cameo which we see in the opening scene. It's a stormy night, and for some reason, young Tommy Jarvis is hanging out in the woods. The boy watches in terror while grave robbers dig up his worst nightmare. And continues to watch as Jason Voorhees once again rises from the dead and slaughters said grave robbers. Frozen with fear, the kid watches as Jason walks towards him with his machete which some idiot buried with him. And just as Jason is about to get even with his destroyer, Tommy wakes up. But he's no longer Corey Feldman. He's not even a kid any more. But he is blonde, now. So, that's good. However, he's now semi-insane and on his way to a halfway house/semi-asylum called Pinehurst. That's bad. But good for us viewers. At Pinehurst, they got hot chicks, all with various breast sizes, a white- trash/hillbilly mother and son who I've next door, and look suspiciously close in age, a wise ass kid named Reggie the reckless, who happens to have a big brother named Demon, who lives near by in his van. If you ever need any enchiladas or jewelry, he's your man. A key member of the Pinehurst gang, an unwanted sack of fat *beep* named Joey, who no one seems to have much patience for, makes the mistake of offering Vic a candy bar while he was busy chopping wood. And informing him that he's out of line when Vic yells at him. The nerve of this guy! Of course Vic is going to stick that Axe in his back and end his miserable life. How else is Joey going to learn some manners? It does suck that Joey's dead because more scenes involving him would have only added to the comedy that lies before us. But I guess he's better off dead. Although, somebody doesn't think so. Back to the new Tommy. This guy doesn't say much of anything. And has no desire to know any of these Pinehurst weirdos. He just wants to stand around and stare at mirrors, and have hallucinations of Jason. He seriously needs to get over that. I mean, he DID win, after all I guess his presence at this place is somehow supposed to make things easier. But someone is going around killing gay greasers and coke heads using some very familiar methods. Is Jason back from the dead? Is Tommy more damaged than we thought? Is someone so annoyed by Joey's murder they they're going around killing everyone except the guy who murdered him? Now, that wouldn't make much sense. Meanwhile, back at Pinehurst. Tommy isn't doing so well. Demon got it good in the out house, the hillbilly mother & son got sent to Heaven with Demon, Pinehurst residents are dropping like flies, and seemingly nobody else is getting laid for the rest of the movie. I sure do wish that one sex scene with Debi Sue Voorhees was still going on. But you can't beat this type of bloody 80's action. Especially now that there's a rainstorm going on now that *beep* now gotten real. just like in Tommy's nightmare. Nice touch, I think. But again. Is it Tommy who is doing this? It's starting to seem like it. Despite being far better than it has any right to be, this film has gained an unnecessary amount of criticism over the years, and is wrongfully considered the black sheep or just the flat out worst installment of the franchise by many, simply because a certain reoccurring character took the night off. Thanks to exploitation director, Danny Steinmann, This movie does offer something a little different, though. but not too different. All the elements which we all love about the past installments are present. But with a higher body count, better/funnier characters, and a sleazy B-movie atmosphere never before seen in a Friday The 13th film. The killer even wears a hockey mask. To some, A New Beginning may have been the slump of the series, and a lazy way of making a few bucks off a once thought dead franchise. But in my opinion, this is not only one of the mast entertaining 80's Slashers out there. But arguably the last great Friday The 13th film. 7/10",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
139,ReelCheese,The Black Sheep?,5,14 June 2006,"The man behind the mask this time ain't our favorite facially-deformed mass murderer, but an impostor. For that reason, Friday the 13th: A New Beginning is often labeled the black sheep of the series.As a fan of the Friday films, it took me a long time to get over Jason's absence (while he does appear in a dream sequence, does that really count?). I mean, you wouldn't make a Rocky film without the Italian Stallion. But once I put that disappointment aside and judged this work on its own merits, I was pleasantly surprised.Of course A New Beginning is far from perfect. Most of the characters are one-dimensional and unappealing, and the thrills are few and far between. When people complain about the senselessness of gory movies, this is the sort of effort they're talking about. Yet for all its faults, A New Beginning boasts a fairly interesting (by genre standards) storyline, as the maniac slashes his way through a facility for troubled youth. Among the tenants is Tommy Jarvis, still plagued by nightmares of hacking up Jason years earlier. There are even a couple of unintentional laughs amid the corny dialog, and the exciting barn finale (yes, they've done a barn finale before, but bear with us) is a highlight that holds up well.The biggest failure here is the attempt at a Scooby Dooish mystery element. The writers perhaps envisioned the audience gasping in the final frames when Roy the ambulance driver's face is revealed beneath the goalie mask. But did anyone actually remember this guy? I had no idea who I was looking at until the dialog revealed his identity. Roy just wasn't prominent enough for us to remember. The producers' desire to go in a different, Jason-less direction showed they didn't really understand their audience. These fans ask for something a bit different each time, but they certainly don't want the wheel reinvented (as the failure of Jason Goes to Hell again illustrated eight years later).More than twenty years after its release, A New Beginning remains the most controversial entry in the series. Many still feel betrayed by the impostor gimmick, but if they can set that aside and try to enjoy this like any other low budget horror flick, they too will be pleasantly surprised.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
140,geminiredblue,Jason Freak!!!,5,7 October 2011,"Aah, finally ""Friday the 13th"" came to an end with PART 4: THE FINAL CHAPTER... yeah right! Welcome to PART 5: A NEW BEGINNING. Tommy Jarvis, the Corey Feldmen character from PART 4, has grown up to be a disturbed young man. For reasons left vague to us, he's being put into a halfway house for troubled teens. Quite a combination of kids, by the way! Among the bunch is a rage-filled ax-wielding young man who chops up another teen in the first twenty minutes. There's also a couple of sex-crazed teens, and I mean ""more so than normal."" There's also a few who have problems expressing themselves as well as a young lady who's always lost in the world of music. So far, as you can guess, this isn't your standard-issue cadre of teens. As a matter of fact, the filmmakers almost achieved turning them into real characters. Apart from them, there's also 14 or so other people who will meet their end in a variety of creative deaths. In the history of the series, this in fact has one of the highest body counts. As for the hockey-masked killer, he's not quite what you'd think. I felt the ending was kind of a cop-out, but if you enjoy the blackest of humor and some really wild special effects, then this is for you!",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
141,happyendingrocks,Not nearly as bad as you'd think a Friday The 13th film without Jason in it would be... but it's still pretty bad,5,19 April 2011,"When the denouement of A New Beginning plays out, it's understandable for Friday The 13th fans to be outraged when they discover that the ""Jason"" in this fifth installment is not our hockey mask-clad hero at all, but actually an impostor using the mythos of Jason to supplement his revenge plot. I'm right there with you, and New Beginning is the entry in the series that I have revisited least often over the years. I hope that my distaste for this movie will be made clear by the fact that I have watched Jason Takes Manhattan more times than this chapter. However, if I'm being truly objective, I have to grudgingly concede that there are some enjoyable bits and pieces in A New Beginning. Though I really want to hate this movie, I would hazard a guess that, if not for the lame-o switcheroo at the end, this misguided sequel might not be as widely derided as it is.Of course, the death scenes are the driving force of any Friday The 13th entry, and on that front, A New Beginning offers up the last truly gory roster of kills fans would see until Jason Goes To Hell, four films and eight years later. Subsequent sequels would fall prey to an increasingly timid MPAA and emerge as largely blood-less affairs, but this outing managed to keep some of its splatter intact. These set-pieces range from the surreally sublime, as when ""Jason"" thrusts a road flare into a guy's mouth and lights him up like a jack-o-lantern, to classic bits of F13 grue like the axe-meets-cranium sequence. My favorite in the film, and one of the high-points of the F13 series, is the pruning shears-to-the-face gag that befalls one amorous lass, which is almost worth the movie alone.One of the biggest criticisms I've heard of this film is how easy it is to spot who the actual killer is. Apparently, many people are miffed by this F13 outing because it sets itself up as a whodunnit, yet doesn't offer any suspense to fuel that distinction. Granted, any scene in which the killer appears in his normal guise makes his guilt patently obvious, and he couldn't be any more inconspicuous unless he had a hockey mask and a machete sticking out of his pockets. However, I think this is probably the most unfair assessment of The New Beginning one can make, for two reasons. Firstly, we aren't supposed to know that Jason is NOT the killer, so the big twist the film hinges on is simply that we are dealing with an impostor here, making who that impostor turns out to be basically irrelevant. Secondly, in every Friday The 13th sequel after Part 2 that DOES feature Jason proper, we know with absolute certainty going in that Jason is the killer. There's certainly no suspense in that, and in fact the main reason we watch F13 films is because we love watching Jason slaughter fornicating teenagers. It seems strange to accuse A New Beginning of failing to protect its twist of identity, when every other Jason-led film thrives on us knowing up front that there is no twist.Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to ascribe any intelligence to the film-makers who created this mess. Rest assured, the dumbest elements in A New Beginning definitely surpass the most insulting bits of idiocy you'll find in any of the F13 films, or in almost any other slasher movie, for that matter. Some of the characters are beyond unlikable, particularly the inbred backwoods yokels Ma and Junior, who seem to have been inserted for comic relief but are so unpleasantly ridiculous that they nearly lobotomize the film single-handedly. Other aspects simply baffle with their inanity, such as a scene where a waitress bares her breasts in front of a mirror and gleefully announces, ""It's show-time!"".Oh, and Demon doesn't wipe, which is just completely gross.The biggest problem with the film arises when you sit down and rationally consider the scheme of the impostor Jason. The killing spree in the film is sparked by the murder of the wholly annoying Joey, and the basic drive for our stand-in is to get revenge on the inhabitants of the camp for troubled youths where Joey was killed. However, some of victims in the film include stranded motorists, neighbors who live by the camp, the brother and future sister-in-law of a child who only visits the camp because his grandfather works there, a waitress at a nearby diner, and her cocaine enthusiast boyfriend... none of whom have anything at all to do with the events that we're led to believe caused the murderous rage in our fake Jason. Does he view everyone in the general vicinity as accessories to Joey's murder?Furthermore, when our resourceful killer dons the Jason attire during his rampage (which is so meticulously copied that he apparently even affixes latex appliances to his head to simulate Jason's baldness and make his ears look deformed), we have to assume that his plan is to kill everybody he encounters. So, who is he dressing up for? If all goes as planned, no one who sees the impostor in full Jason regalia is going to live to tell anyone about it, so any chance of furthering the Jason legacy or attributing the copycat crimes to him is pretty much negated.Yes, this film was a terrible idea. Yes, it's one of the worst films in the F13 franchise (but not THE worst... you have to go to New York for that). But judging it as a basic slasher movie, you have to admit that A New Beginning delivers much of what you sign on for by watching it. Future installments in the series would wisely forget this film ever happened, but since we're stuck with it as is, it's worth looking on the bright side in this instance.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
142,ryan-10075,"""What's wrong? Hey, you okay?"" ""It's them damn enchiladas.""",5,28 July 2020,"Welcome to the black sheep of the family. The much disliked fifth entry in the FRIDAY THE 13TH series. In the end though I do think the hatred for this entry is actually deserved. Face it there is no Jason in this movie. In the end we find out that the killer is a paramedic named Roy Burns (Dick Weiand) whose son Joey (Dominick Brascia) was axed to death by Victor Faden (Mark Venturini). Burns ends up killing everyone around the Pinehurst Halfway House other than Vic. To me it is a very stupid and hollow surprise. They really tried to outdo the original, but in the end it falls flat on its face. Which is sad because at times this does very much feel like a FRIDAY movie.Personally there were three ways to make this movie. Number one; just leave Jason dead and move on. After making a reported 151.2 million on the previous four FRIDAYs I guess Paramount figured this idea could be milked some more, so just moving onto other film ideas wasn't in their best interest with a cash cow like Jason Vorhees. Number two; make Tommy Jarvis the killer. Right at the end of part IV it was suggested that Tommy was going to be hacking people up. Even at the end of this film as well. Must say my personally favourite Tommy was Corey Feldman and he does return in this film, but just for a dream sequence. I don't pile the hate on John Shepard like some do. I think he did do a very good job. The problem is his character is just going through his mind over Jason the entire movie until the end when he kills Roy Burns. There sadly really isn't a whole lot to his character other than a red herring. Number three; actually bring Jason back. I think it would have been cool to see Corey Feldman in some way bring Jason back and then he is sent to a mental asylum where they think he is totally crazy over Jason, but he is back and out to kill him while he is locked up. Alas, they went totally off the map and stapled a very poor ending on this movie.There are interesting characters though such as Reggie the Reckless (Shavar Ross) and his brother Demon (Miguel A. Nunez Jr.) as well as the crazed Ethel (Carol Locatell) and her idiot son Junior (Ron Sloan). They do in fact add a lot to the film and do make the film interesting. Another note for some people is there are a lot of kills in this film. Like all FRIDAYs some are good and some are bad.I give this entry a 5/10 which in the end might be giving it more credit than it deserves, but I never am close to bored when watching it, it delivers on some elements that make a FRIDAY movie and I do give it some credit for trying to go off the beaten path although it fails in that department.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

144,Toronto85,Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning,5,16 March 2011,"This sequel gets a really bad rap from fans of the franchise, and I can understand why. Jason Vorhees is non-existent in the entire thing. I however thought this separate film wasn't as bad as everyone says it is. It's a decent 80's horror film. Tommy Jarvis is now an adult, many years have passed since Jason killed all those people from parts 2-4. Tommy is put in a special ""halfway house"" facility. As soon as he gets there, one of the residents gets murdered by another patient with an axe. I still can't believe they would give some of those teens sharp weapons. Anyways, after two ambulance drivers pick up the corpse a series of murders are committed in the town and all signs point to Jason Vorhees. One problem though - Jason is dead and buried (or cremated as the mayor says).After the 4th film, I seriously thought they were going to have Tommy Jarvis become the next killer of the series, maybe take over for Jason. Well in this one it gives viewers the idea that he is the one doing the killings. Is it him or someone else? The murders are OK, most are sort of off screen. There are some spooky moments like the end chase scene, but it's nothing spectacular like the first four. Heck, most of the time the killer doesn't even use a machete. A meat clever is the main weapon of choice for this serial slasher.The killer's identity is weak, very weak. Anyone else being the killer would have been more interesting. There is one very funny character named Ethel who is a belligerent older woman living with her grown son. She is the only likable character next to Reggie the Reckless and Demon played by Miguel A Nunez. Everyone else is pretty much meaningless. The ending is very odd too, which is right on par for Friday films. John Sheppard who plays Tommy is a bore to watch. I guess since he is playing a half mute character with three lines, I shouldn't expect much. But I did not like his portrayal of Tommy at all.Overall, this isn't THAT BAD despite all the negativity I spewed above. It's not very good, but it's a decent attempt at a mid eighties slasher film. It's got boobs, it's got kills, etc. It gets put down as being the ""black sheep"" of the Friday family like Halloween III does for having no Michael Myers. Like Halloween III, this sequel is watchable and deserves a place in the Friday the 13th franchise.5/10",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

My favorite parts are the end of each movie where Jason or his mom go on a killing spree and try to kill the heroine of the film. I'll add that part 7 & 10 also have great endings to them. Part V is a solid film. Having a guy acting like Jason and not being Jason did not bother me like it did others. To me, he was Jason. Great kills and another good cast of characters which we had for the first 6 films. Melanie Kinnaman was one of my favorite female leads along with Dana Kimmell and Jennifer Cooke.

146,CMRKeyboadist,I Remember It Being Much Worse,7,19 August 2006,"Okay, most us know that this is by far one of the weakest movies of the whole series (none are weaker then Jason X) but going back and watching this movie after probably 15 years, I will admit that I enjoyed it. Although, as a true Jason purest, this movie pales in comparison to the first 4 of the series.From what I can gather, this movie takes place a few years after Tommy Jarvis killed Jason in the 4th film. Poor Tommy has never been the same since (especially since Corey Feldman isn't even playing as him) and has been in and out of therapy. Tommy is sent to a therapeutic camp for teenagers and fits in pretty well from what I could gather from all the weirdos that were in there. It's when one of the other teenagers decides to chop up this fat obnoxious kid with an axe that all Hell brakes loose and the Jason nightmare starts all over again.The plot is thin, but that is no surprise. Most of the Jason flicks have a thin plot. And the gory moments aren't altogether on the fore front (except a few moments). But, I still found this to be a rather enjoyable slasher. Better then some of the other slashers that were coming out at the same time.There was a few scenes that are worth mentioning. The first being the murder of the fat kid. I remember the first time I saw that I was completely surprised. Now I see it and I laugh hysterically about it. It was just so unexpected. Also, the murder of Reggies brother in the movie. It wasn't funny a scene but it was one of the best in the whole movie. And of course, when the fake Jason gets killed was pretty good also. Falling on a random bed of spikes is always welcome.Not that great of a Jason flick, but still has its moments. If you haven't seen it yet, check it out.

Basically the concept goes along the same lines.Lone survivor of FTT part 4 and haunted with memories of Jason after killing the psychopath brutally, Tommy is sent to a home asylum near the woods after doctors have failed to treat his post traumatic stress disorder. Unfortunately killings start here also and now Tommy is sure Jason has returned from the grave for revenge.The difference? This time it's not camp Crystal Lake, but a small asylum near the woods.It's not about campers (they are all dead hahaha)but about mentally unstable people. Also this time, some people are murdered after being blinded. But the climax is definitely surprising.Otherwise – Grotesque stuff, nudity, same creepy musicthose FTT elements are always there, aren't they?

148,kingofdanerds,Friday the 13th Part V: An Extended epilogue,6,26 January 2021,"Despite having Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter supposed to be the final chapter in the Friday the 13th series, the next year in 1985, Friday the 13th: A New Beginning was released. This time around, Danny Steinmann is in the director's chair and oddly enough, according to his IMDB page, has only four directing credits and one of them is a pornographic film which is not much of a surprise if you look at Friday the 13th: A New Beginning. The film stars John Shephard as the new Tommy Jarvis. Friday the 13th: A New Beginning was a box office success but was not a critical success with (no surprise) critics but surprisingly was not a huge critical success with audiences and for reasons that can only be seen if one watches the film because I am not willing to spoil this film.It has been five years since Tommy supposedly killed Jason. He has been giving all kinds of treatment with no signs of improvement. He is being transfered to a halfway home. But once that happens, the killings continue. Has Jason returned? Or is it Tommy? Or maybe it is someone else?I can understand where the hate is directed towards in this film and I don't think that it is wrong but I do not 100 percent agree with it. I think the setup is actually really interesting for this film. You have three possibilities as to who the killer could be whether it be Jason (who is supposedly dead but nobody knows for sure), Tommy (who is mentally and psychologically declining), or a copycat (which is just as plausible). But the problem with this is the execution. I will not reveal too much as I do try my best to write spoiler free reviews. All I can really say is that if you are one who likes twists in a horror film, give this one a shot. I cannot guarantee that you might like it though. I suppose the best way to look at all of this is in the same way that the first Friday the 13th film had it's twist. Now, I did mention that this film was directed by Danny Steinmann. I have not seen any other films directed by him but I am familiar with his type of filmwork. With that being said, this film is a total sleazefest. This film has the most nudity in any of the Friday the 13th films. So, if you come and watch horror films for the nudity, A New Beginning is that type of horror film. Not only is it full of nudity, but it has some vulgar dialouge as well. I think the vulgarity of this film makes the film rather interesting because it does make it rather unique which is saying something because Friday the 13th is a slasher franchise full of vulgar content and whatnot. Sure, it does not make for a smart horror film, but do I expect this series to be smart? In the previous film, we had top notch kills. In this film, well......not so much. Once again, the MPAA played a factor in this film. But, even still from what I can see, the effects are not really that good overall. The kills themselves are mostly the same stabby stabby in the gut type of kills or just the stabby stabby. There are a few kills that are pretty inventive but that is not saying much because this film does have the highest body count in the whole franchise and as I said previously, most of the kills are the stabby stabby ones. The characters suck in this film. We get an occasional character that does stand out in this film like Reggie, Demon, and even Tommy himself. The characters are probably the worst in the franchise so far. There are just too many characters and oh so little time to develop them all. Which begs the question..... What the hell is wrong with all of these people that they have to go to a half way home? They all seem perfectly fine to me for the most part. Tommy to me seems to be the only one who actually needs to be there. I used to not really like Tommy in this film but have come to realize that this version of Tommy is actually quite interesting. Sure, he does not say much and is nowhere near as interesting like he was in the previous film but think about what happened to him. I got to give John Shephard credit for his performance in this film. He does portray a mentally and psychologically unstable Tommy Jarvis pretty well which is saying something because a few years ago, I would have said the complete opposite. As for mostly everyone else, utter crap. Sure, it is far from the worst acting I have seen in this series, but it is still pretty bad. The climax as usual is pretty entertaining but is a step down from some of the previous entries. I will go on to say that out of all of the first five Friday films, this films climax ranks last but that is not to say it is bad. The music outside of the main theme and what not is really fun. For example, the music that the punk character Violet listens to absolutely slaps. There is a lot of minor things that are more so nitpicks than anything and there are some major ones that I so wish that I could say but, I try to keep these reviews spoiler free. But one thing I want to mention that has been mentioned by a few online internet critics like the Cinema Snob is about the newspaper clipping they show in the film that has a photograph of Jason. WHO THE HELL TOOK A PICTURE OF JASON AND SURVIVED???Friday the 13th: A New Beginning is a really interesting film and I will give it credit for that. I do feel like they did try on this film and gave us a few new ideas. I think the reason why I like this film somewhat is because of how different it is even though it is not all too different if you think about it. It is very sleazy and give it credit too for that. It is just an interesting film.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
149,RhapsodyReviews,Worst in the Franchise.,2,6 October 2019,"Review:
'Friday the 13th: A New Beginning' is an American slasher film directed by Danny Steinmann and is the fifth installment in the 'Friday the 13th' film series. If I am being honest this is by far my least favorite in the 'Friday the 13th' franchise.
The film is set at a fictional halfway house, where an adult Tommy Jarvis (John Shepherd) who killed Jason Voorhees as a child, again fears for his life when a new hockey-masked assailant begins a series of brutal murders.
I don't know how it managed to get worse, but the acting is by far is bad as it has ever been in the series. It's almost like nobody knew what the movie was, and just showed up on the set and the director just went with it.
John Shepherd who plays Tommy in this movie may not have been able to flesh out what the character needed, but the writers made the character development from the first time we saw him in 'Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter' to now realistic. Tommy is a badass who trained to be able to defend himself, and I would have to believe that if anybody went through that kind of trauma would do the same.
Overall, with 'Friday the 13th' being one of my favorite franchises, I was rally let down by this film. I personally can't see anybody enjoying themselves even if they are Jason fans like myself.

150,DustinRahksi,Tommy beats ass.,5,15 February 2013,"I think this film should be a little higher than a 4.3. It was pretty entertaining and funny, but it tries to capture the atmosphere of the previous films and fails. This review will contain all the moments that I thought I should comment about, I wrote it all down so it's going to be a little jumbled. Don't worry there is no plot key spoilers.The characters were a little more likable than previous entries, mainly Reggies brother. The story follows some troubled kids, some are good, such as Violet, she didn't really deserve what she got. Then we got a guy who goes ape-s**t with an axe, it comes completely out of nowhere, and for some odd reason was the fuel for the plot, let's just say it was poorly thought out. Tommy is now very secluded in his mind, but also has picked up some fighting techniques that he beats down his opponents with. The hillbillies serve as comic relief, the mom has a nice vocabulary, the son is a knuckle-head. It seems they only wanted pretty girls for this movie, because thats all you see. I don't get why they had to get a girl with the biggest breasts they could find, they are supposed to be young teens right. It turns out she gets a nice death. She has hedge clippers clipping out her eyes, I find it sadistic when they go for the eyes. This film had way too many kills, you don't even get to see half of them, whats the point. And another thing I found annoying is that there is two times during the film that people experience car trouble, are you kidding me, whats the chance. Cars must have been poorly made back then. The guy who dresses as a greaser( black jacket, white shirt, and slicked up hair) has a pretty funny moment when he starts singing a song about the car not starting.Overall this film is pretty fun. It does have it's share of flaws, like Jason fixing his mask, I don't know if that was intentional because of who the killer was. It's some good Ol' slasher fun.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
151,FKDZ,"Lack of likable characters, losing its charm",4,29 August 2020,"So here we are back again with another Friday The 13th. Now Jason is back (but not really, or is he?) I guess starting off one thing this movie did well is it kept you guessing whether Jason is actually back or not. And we don't really get an answer either.The few positives of this movie are that they tried to *attempt* something new, with actually having a main character continue their story from the previous movie. So I liked that. Sadly Tommy is incredibly underdeveloped character wise and just not likeable. We hardly get to know anything about Tommy, at the end of the movie he had zero development. We'll see how it continues but I hope they actually expand on Tommy. That said, we do learn that Tommy's got some moves!I said ''few'' positives, but now that I'm writing it I have a hard time remembering more... I guess the soundtrack is still good, but it hasn't evolved or anything. The directing was okay-ish. It was decent all around but some shots were just really out of place and rough. Oh and the two hillbilly characters were just ridiculous in a fun way. Not in a good acting/writing way persé, but they brought some much needed humor although it didn't last long.That said, I think this movie has a twist, the paramedic isn't the only Jason, the actual Jason does live as well in this movie but is never shown fully. All the more random kills, like the greasers, the couple doing coke, and the hillbilly's are I think killed by the real Jason. During those kills you never get to see Jason's face. This makes me think that only the Paramedic was involved in kills where you could see his actual face. So if that is actually how it was written, that's a actually a pretty great little thing.Now the bad, I think the worst thing this movie does is attempt a different setting than ''some hot teens out camping'' but it still results in the same thing. So these kids are supposedly all troubled and have been send to this ''loony bin'' but you give some aggressive guy an axe? They create this whole institute for mentally ill teens or whatever. And most of them are just normal teens but one has a stutter, one is a goth and that one couple are supposedly nymphomaniacs? (smart idea putting them together.../s). The only REAL troubled kid is Tommy but he is completely out of place of what seems like some weird summer camp. Still not one characters is actually explained, like why is a guy with a stutter in this specific camp for 8 months? Like there must be more to him? Well, we never find out. Most of them are all pretty normal. They should've send that creep Scott there from Part II.And with that this movie, much like Part III loses its charm due to just incredibly dull and bland characters. None of them are likeable or relatable. The whole setup just doesn't work.Now the important part for a Slasher, the Kills. Downright disappointing and the main reason for the low rating in addition to the other points. How do you ruin a throat slit? The first movie done on a shoestring budget even did that better! There wasn't even any flowing blood, mostly just some paint. The only memorable kill was the road flare into the greasers mouth, and the hillbillies's decap. The rest of them were just completely unsatisfying and some even off screen. Part II still holds the title for best kills so far into this franchise.Now the ending, assuming there were two Jason's (one the paramedic being dead). The real Jason does seem to have possessed Tommy at the end there. Unless it was a double hallucination its the only way I could see it go. So I guess it's interesting? We'll see in the next part.4/10 Lack of likable/logical characters and disappointing kills.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

This is the fifth installment in the popular yet low brow slasher thriller Friday the 13th series. This installment was a confounding and horrible idea from the outset, and I am not sure why the idea ever actually saw the light of day. This changes the formula of these slasher films in a few crucial ways. Perhaps they thought it would inject some vital energy into the franchise, but it wound up being essentially the same shtick only more bizarre. In an attempt to keep some continuity we pick up years after the events of 'The Final Chapter' as Tommy Jarvis, played memorably by Corey Feldman in the previous film, is now an adult and a very troubled/haunted young man.
Tommy is still haunted by his encounter with Jason Voorhees so long ago. He constantly dreams about him and fears his supernatural return. For this film action moves from the area surrounding Crystal Lake and that mythology to a halfway house cum mental institution where Tommy has just been transferred. So you wind up with the same crop of people ripe for the slaughter just in a more aberrant setting. Tommy keeps quiet and to himself. Early one patient brutally kills compulsive eater Joey and is arrested for the crime. Shortly thereafter killings start occurring in brutal and bizarre ways concentrating mainly on the halfway house residents and staff and those in their immediate orbit. In classic Friday fashion the killer goes long unseen and the killings occur mainly in isolation so the group at large never learns what is happening until their number is up. It actually becomes noticeable at one point in the film that Jason, the only true star of the franchise, hadn't been seen on camera outside of dreams and visions. It was reminiscent of the original which famously hid the killer until the big reveal that it was, in fact, Jason's mother. There is much uncertainty throughout as to who the killer actually is. Could it be one of the unhinged patients, or Tommy or actually Jason himself returned once again? Also there is no realization of Jason by the protagonists which usually would spawn some sort of delving into his backstory or mythos. Eventually the killer is seen sporting Jason's famous hockey mask clad face. Predictably after numerous gruesome deaths it comes down to Tommy and Jason. Also predictably Tommy is able to get the best of Jason and kill him in grand fashion, however when the beast is unmasked it is not Jason at all, but the paramedic father of the slain boy from early in the movie who is taking out his revenge on all those he blamed. What a great twist, right? Not so much.
When you wrap your mind around the fact that the killer in the film was never Jason at all it winds up making you feel like you have been duped as an audience member rather than sharing in some interesting movie plot twist. This is essentially a Jason movie without Jason. This has all the prototypical plot points for a Friday slasher film. It has some sex as well as creative and gruesome deaths. The acting is universally horrendous and no actor involved in this production went on to be an actor of any caliber. The writing is subpar and the direction is basic. Really all these films have going for them is Jason and his associated mythology, imagery and iconography. When you take that away nothing here can hold without that center so this winds ultimately as a gross misfire that failed to capitalize on the one thing the franchise is worth: masked killer Jason Vorhees.

157,tom_koopa,"Part 5 of the Friday series isn't horrible, but I have to admit that...",5,1 January 2010,"The series is going down in quality with every sequel it seems. Which is really a shame, because they started out so well.So what story do we have this time? We follow Tommy, our fearsome hero from the prequel, as an adult who's badly traumatized by the events that took place in Friday 13th part 4. Which is understandable. You follow a group of people inside a 'nuthouse', as how one of the characters in this movie calls it, who basically get killed by Jason one by one at a time. However, the story behind Jason this time is a little different. I won't spoil it here, but I have to admit it was a nice touch.But still, it's not a really good movie. It's what you have seen 4 times already but just with different characters. There's not much new here, except for a few new 'creative' ways of killing someone. That's all there is really.For fans of Friday, this is of course enjoyable, but it's not really recommended for fans of horror films.

This fact is not revealed until the very end, but since it is such common knowledge among genre fans, I feel blameless in discussing it here. The truth is, the film is so arbitrary that it would have made no difference even if Jason had truly risen from his grave, where he must have been rolling for the duration of the film. Director Danny Steinmann seems to be aiming for a murder mystery type of story, suggesting that the killer may be a mental patient or some redneck. However, this element is so ineptly handled that it simply doesn't matter. It's just a bad slasher movie that lurches from one kill scene to another, peopled with cartoonishly obnoxious characters who deserve what they get. There's plenty of gore and female nudity, but even then, it never rises from the muck.For the most part, the performances are strictly amateur night, although John Shepherd does a decent job as Tommy Jarvis, a decade or so after part 4. Shavar Ross does his best, though kid characters in horror movies are almost always annoying. (Exception: ""Halloween"") Melanie Kinnaman is okay; at least she doesn't embarrass herself. Otherwise, most of the actors, who shall remain nameless, deserve to have their SAG cards torn up, especially that Michael Jackson wannabe. Why do actors do these movies anyway? Are they that desperate for the money? Don't they know that appearing in a Jason flick is a guaranteed career-killer? I think one actress was denied a promising role in an Oliver Stone film for that reason. To be fair, there's little that can be done with such poor material.The only good part is the flashback in the beginning, featuring a cameo by Corey Feldman. Otherwise, it's pure and utter drivel; poorly acted (discounting the above exceptions), written, and directed. I'm not a snob; I actually enjoyed parts 6 and 7 at times, though otherwise the films are just average slasher movies. I'm giving this one a bad review simply because I found no chills or thrills in this unfortunate sequel. I tend to be fairly critical of horror movies, and this one deserves a good thrashing. Didn't this one actually send fans protesting at Paramount's gates? See, even with the fans, you can't throw just anything at them; they know what they want too.1/2 star (out of ****)Released by Paramount Pictures",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

161,boyinflares,A bad start for a New Beginning,4,28 January 2006,"It was by no means a bad move to make more Friday the 13th's following number 4, ""The Final Chapter"". This ""ressurection"" of the esteemed Jason Voorhees fails miserably. Like entry number 9, ""Jason Goes to Hell"", this installation is too far removed from the others in terms of storyline, taking it away from Camp Crystal Lake and the usual plots. The extremely large cast also take away screen time from each other, meaning 95% of the cast we simply do not care about them, which is very wrong.Another way this film strays from the normal horror routines is by having a male in the lead (John Shepherd as Tommy), though it's not like he is present very much, and he is so boring that he is painful to watch, a far cry from Corey Feldman and Thom Mathews who play Tommy in parts 4 and 6, respectively. Few horror films have males in the lead, though others include ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 2"" and ""Prom Night 3"", some argue that a male lead doesn't work as well as female, I think it depends on the characters.Another difference between ""A New Beginning"" and the previous entries is that there are a lot of adult and authority figures present, though the authority only works to a certain degree. Richard Young plays Matt, the head of the home Tommy is put in, and while he does an okay job, his authority is not that present. The supposed-heroine of the film is Pam (Melanie Kinnaman), and once more to be different than the previous films, she is not a teen, but assistant head of the home Tommy and the other teens are in, and once again, this change doesn't work well, not to mention she is almost as bad as Kari Keegan's Jessica, the heroine from part 9.While the film is littered with a boring and / or useless cast and characters, there are a few highlights. Shavar Ross plays Reggie, another child (like Tommy was in part 4), and I must say, Shavar Ross can scream better than any of the women in this film. Carol Locatell is great as the crazy neighbor Ethel, and the only two teens that one could really care for, Eddie and Tina, played by hottie John Robert Dixon and Debisue Voorhees who had great hair, also get the best deaths. Of the other teens, none are particularly noteworthy, except perhaps Tiffany Helm who plays Violet - but only for her hair.Now a major reason that the film just doesn't work is because it is not Jason doing the killings (which i might add are in general not very gory), but a paramedic called Roy (played by Dick Wieand) who discovers his son has been killed at the home Tommy and the others stay at, so he uses Jason's old M.O to get revenge. Admirable, but doesn't quite hit the mark. So unless you are a die-hard Jason fan, then I would recommend watching parts 2 or 7, far superior sequels.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
162,au_law2001,You say it's bad? I think it's great!,7,22 January 2005,"I've been hearing a lot of people say this was weak, all for the same reasons. There was no Jason. Jason was killed. But hey, this is great, that's what makes it creepy and horrifying, you don't know who it is, you guess who it is, but not very sure, that's the point of the film. It also shows how Tommy from the 4th one, supposed final one, which is actually not, since we have 6,7,8, Jason Goes to Hell, Jason X, and Freddy vs Jason, is coping from his problems, he is trying to forget his past, but the burden of it, and the terrifying memories, the trauma of his mother killed, still haunts him. And after a misunderstanding from one of the mental patients which leads to murder, more killings come out of nowhere, and mostly it is those involved in the nut house, especially the weirdo mother and son, and Miguel A. Nunez who had nothing to do with it, I don't know, why I guess he needed to vent. It's all coming back, the past has come back to haunt Tommy who is recovering, and who is it? Didn't they say Jason died? Is it that mental patient doing it? Or any other mental patients, as the mother warned the sheriff? Or is it Jason back from the dead to commit more murders? You see that's what makes the movie worthwhile we are to believe that it is one of the mental patients, until later we are to believe that it is Jason only to find it isn't. That was the twist, and there is something more shocking that follows, the mental state of Tommy at the end, as he looses it at the end.Real shocking. I found it a great addition, it played as a preview as they release another installment the following year with Jason Lives. That one Jason comes back. If there is any weak one, I'd say it would be Jason X because the story there was too far-fetched. Anyways, watch this, it's worth it. You'll see what I mean.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
163,chucknorrisfacts,Avoid!,2,19 October 2007,"I say avoid this film. It attempted to move the series in a new direction after ""Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter"", the previous film's ending seemed to prevent any possibility of Jason returning to wreak more havoc. This movie decided a new killer; in the guise of Jason would be a good idea. Wrong. They were dead wrong.In my opinion, the whole ""copycat killer"" angle is pretty cheesy and seldom, if ever, works. We've seen it attempted in this film, as well as in ""Halloween H20: Twenty Years Later"" if we're to buy into what ""Halloween: Resurrection"" would have us believe. However, that was not the fault of ""H20"" but rather ""Resurrection"" for desperately trying to explain how it is Michael Myers could have survived the events of the previous film.The problem is you can't make a copycat killer have the same abilities as the original killer(s), Michael and Jason are unstoppable not some guys dressed up like them. Yet a film of this nature wouldn't be as exciting if the killers were easier to stop, so the filmmakers sacrifice any quality to their sequels in order to replace it with quantity.This film is not worth renting, it's hardly worth watching on television for free, but that is most definitely the better way of viewing it. At least you're only wasting your time and not your money too.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
164,Minus_The_Beer,"""It's...Showtime!""",7,29 November 2011,"Although everyone's favorite unhappy camper, Jason Voorhees, was effectively chopped to bits at the end of ""Friday the 13th Pt. IV: The Final Chapter,"" that doesn't mean Crystal Lake is safe. Since Paramount executives had green in their eyes and a proved franchise to work with, ""A New Beginning"" it was. Picking up where the fourth film left off, ""Friday the 13th Pt. V: A New Beginning"" follows our hero Tommy Jarvis, who is now grown up and played by John Shepherd (taking over for Corey Feldman who was busy shooting ""The Goonies""). After being dumped in a half-way house near his old stomping grounds, Tommy and his roommates soon find a familiar threat looming. It's seems a certain hockey masked killer has come back to resume his reign of terror. Or has he? ""A New Beginning"" has become, more or less, the black sheep of the ""Friday the 13th"" franchise. But why? Sure, ""A New Beginning"" introduces an all-too obvious twist (even to first-time viewers) that can leave a bad taste in one's mouth, but aside from this bit, it's business as usual for the residents of Crystal Lake. The teens still party, get naked and get slashed, so to that end, the average Jason fan should find much to indulge in. Also on deck is a solid performance by Shepherd who plays Tommy with an air of mystery and creepiness. You're never quite sure if you're supposed to root for him or be afraid of him and that certainly makes him the most interesting character in the entire franchise. Likewise, other characters like the obnoxious Violet (played by Tiffany Helm), who spends most of the film jamming to her Walkman, and the spunky Reggie the Reckless (Shavar Ross) -- a character deserving of his own spin-off -- help flesh out the film and give it a bit more color than the average slasher.Director Danny Steinmann has roots in adult-film, so naturally the film is a little seedier than its predecessors. In a way, that's part of the film's charm and what helps set it apart from the rest of the series. Sure, there's no redeeming social value to the film, but the 90 minutes of bloody fun it presents is nothing to sneeze at either. ""A New Beginning"" is, quite simply, a down and dirty little slasher that gets its job done (mostly) right. Is it a ground-breaking, mind-blowing genre effort? Not at all. Is it the finest entry in the series? Not by a long-shot. Does it deliver the goods expected of a typical ""Friday the 13th"" film? You bet. Don't be fooled by its bad reputation; ""A New Beginning"" is just as good as any fifth entry in any slasher franchise, perhaps even better.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

I was so disappointed for shelling out the few dollars that I had to see this movie that tears fell from my eyes. How did this movie ever get made? Was the head of Paramount on vacation? The only reason I would give a recommendation to see this movie would be to see the nude scene with Debi Sue Voorhees. Other than that, the movie is a complete waste. Some of the deaths are pretty gruesome, but not worth the hour and half it takes to get through them all. Plus, the mindbending twist that is revealed at the end of the film is totally stupid. I would have had a more enjoyable time watching the grass grow. Don't watch this movie, not even for the nude scene I mentioned earlier.

If not for my cousin who I am indebted to for taping me this flick I would never have seen it. but I surly understand why it took so long to find, cause it is crap. The acting is so lame it almost bores me to sleep every time I watch it. And that is quite often as I am a Jason nut and sit through marathons of the series on semi regular basis. That is why I almost feel forced into this one. It is the red haired step child that won't go away no matter how hard you beat it. Danny Stienmen the director of this must have never watched the previous four as he left out the mos important ingredient Jason. I assume though that it was the power that be at Paramount that led to this rather than him. The studio that made the first eight of these never got Jason. They never gave him a chance. It was just blind luck that Jason got this far without being screwed up. I say skip this one go to six as it is the funniest or even better go back to four at is the masterpiece of the set.

168,KHayes666,Oops!,3,20 February 2008,"Friday the 13th part 5 Too many sequels can be a bad thing and this one hit rock bottom on so many levels. Since Jason was ""killed"" in part 4 some brainiac decided that they should make another sequel but this time the killer would not be Jason (cue the record needle scratching). Yessire bob, a Friday the 13th movie without Jason in it, just imagine how well that went.The story is Tommy Jarvis (no longer played by Corey Feldman although he does appear in the movie) never recovered mentally after killing Jason so he's sent to a funny farm getaway with complete morons nowhere near Crystal Lake. Not only is Jason not in the movie, it doesn't even begin, end or have any location in Crystal Lake either. The cast of mental patients were so redundant and so stupid I couldn't wait for whoever the killer was to wipe them out and any other clowns to appear in the movie. As Tommy begins to get settled in his new home and making friends with the token black guy, the plot thickens (or is it sickens?). One of the happy home patients named Vic isn't happy at all and he hacks a fat special needs kid to death with an axe. The orderlies show up to take the carcass away and one of them almost throws up upon witnessing the sight. Later on that night Jason appears and thus the horror begins....and I proceed to almost throw up myself.This movie has more holes in it than a piece of cheese in Killer Rats. First off, Tommy Jarvis went from being 11 years old to 21 between part 4 and 5 (Corey Feldman does make a cameo in the opening scene which turned out to be just a dream) nevermind the fact it couldn't have been but a year or two after the last movie. Technically this means the movie is set in 1995 instead of 1985 because in the story lines part 2 took place 5 years after part one, which was 1980. Movies 2, 3 and 4 all were around the same week or so, so we are to believe its 1985 when Tommy hacked up Jason at the end of part 4. Now Tommy looks to be 10 years older so logically this is supposed to be 1995 yet the ambulances look out of the 70's.So now we're in 1995 and Jason appears and proceeds to kill off the funny farm residents, the people who work there and any other idiot who passes through in the movie. To anyone who has seen this movie, was there really a point to that drifter wearing the wifebeater being in the film? Tommy then teams up with the one nurse and the token black kid named Reggie the Reckless (who is easily freaked out by just about everything) to kill Jason.....only we found out its not Jason. Turns out ""Jason"" was actually the orderly that almost threw up upon seeing the fat guy dead, the reason being he was his father. This is where the whole movie became stupid instantly. How can this normal human being mimic not only Jason's stealth (one minute this girl with insanely huge breasts closes her eyes and then she opens them and the Orderly/Jason is there) but his damage intake as well? The whole ""Its not Jason"" plot twist thus renderred the whole entire movie worthless and a waste of time to any Jason fan. I can't even give props to the kills because it wasn't Jason doing them nor could anyone else have managed the kind of stealth or strength to pull them off. The characters were stupid, the plot was dumb and the ending made the whole movie pointless, avoid it like the plague.The 2 highlights in the movie is when Tommy hits an angleslam through a table on one of the funny farm inmates and later on he beats the living crap out of crazy lady's special needs son. Unfortunately these 2 scenes are not enough to save the movie from being full of horse manure.3 out of 10",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
169,angiris,This is not a Friday movie. Plain and simple. And anyone telling you it is either blind or deluded.,3,8 July 2017,"Title says it all. Now I'll explain why. 1st of all. Spoiler alert after 32 years. Jason is not even in the f###ing. His mother isn't here either. Only a dude who imitates him. Now. The 1st review I saw on this site said its the best of the Friday movies. Majority of up-votes too. Are people insane? Or have the worst taste and understanding of this franchise? The MAIN CHARACTER IN THE FRANCHISE NEXT TO HIS MOTHER.... IS NOT HERE. Its like making a movie about Dracula...WITHOUT Dracula. making a movie about aliens from mars. AND NEVER SEE ALIENS!I truly don't understand whats happening here. The apologists, the over-thinkers, the mad fanboys. The throwbacks to the original is the most lazy, insulting crap I've seen since I decided to watch Rob Zombies Halloween sequel, although I was avoiding it for years for good reason. In the 1st movie we didn't know who the killer was. That was scary, the kills were well done, showing a lot, satisfying gore wise and not quickly finished either. Well balanced and executed. In this film they try to copy the stealth things, but utterly FAIL doing so because: 1: The kills are super fast. 2: The kills aren't even properly shown. 3: Our non-supernatural killer acts the same way as Jason himself acts by appearing everywhere. THis is bullsh#t for so many reasons and non-sensical lore-wise. 4: We don't have a main character in this movie. There are huge sections of the film where Tommy Jarvis is just straight up missing. And he barely says anything the ENTIRE film. Nr 5: Kills happen that we Don't see. Multiple times. Why is this? haven't we gotten used to seeing them? Especially in the 2nd movie and 3rd. This film annoyed me. But what straight up gave me a migraine was seeing reviews on IMDb giving this a 8-9-10 and calling it the best ever. Is there a special edition I don't know about? Did we see the same movie? Was there some kind of directorial cut where it was ACTUALLY JASON IN THE FILM.... and not poor little paramedic dude who lost his fat kid that we didn't care about AT ALL because he literally had like 2 scenes before he died where he said something like 5 lines. Are people serious? This isn't just bad taste. This is downright dishonest reviews. Bottomline is this. Say what you will. But no matter your arguments... this is not Friday the 13th. For 2 big reasons. Nr. 1: Friday movies concern the date itself. Jason appears on his birthday. This is iconic. Nr. 2: Jason isn't even in the film. Only a dream sequence that doesn't matter because he's DEAD. he has been in a god damn grave the ENTIRE FILM. And furthermore. What makes you wonder things the entire film, is why the hell Jason would leave crystal lake, and murder people just because, randomly, all over, no connection, nada. We have seen this happen before. In highly criticized movies like Jason takes Manhattan. Or Jason goes to hell. It wasn't a good idea with this movie, nor with those. But that's beside the points mentioned above that weigh in the most. Say what you will people. I call bull#### on your reviews after having seen this film. Thank god the score itself depicts this film as below average regardless of the fanboy reviews. Because that is exactly what this insulting garbage is. Thank god part 6 brought us a repair of the Tommy character, making him strong, likable, courageous and determined. Instead of a spineless, confused, damaged and borderline USELESS character that we got in this film. Still not convinced? let me elaborate on the discussion between the producer, director and writer regarding this film's creation. ""Hey guys. I have this amazing idea. Get this, okay? You ready?... Right. Lets make a Friday the 13th movie... BUT WITHOUT JASON :D! Doesn't that sound BRILLIANT?! We'll make it more like the 1st movie, except not show a lotta blood and death scenes. Oh. And we'll throw in an annoying, out of place kid ! "" ""But, who's gonna be our killer, man? No Jason? """"Get this, right?. Okay. Our killer... is gonna look almost the same as Jason, but instead be a disgruntled paramedic that had his fat son killed for some whatever reason by a dude with an axe in a lunatic asylum in the middle of nowhere!!! Isn't that great ?!"" I'm so done. 3 out of 10. Worst movie that DARES call itself a Friday movie. And to the reviewers on here. I'm gonna choose to believe your reviews are bought and paid for. Because its easier to comprehend corruption, than the possibility that you actually enjoy this level of insulting crap writing and poor, copy and paste cinematography, plus steering a franchise in a direction where its OKAY TO REMOVE THE MAIN CHARACTER AFTER 5 FILMS!WTF, people... just.... What the F.Edit: I almost forgot. Whoever thought it was a good idea to throw in a redneck half-wit screaming idiot who serves NO OTHER PURPOSE than to make us wish for him to die, as well as his mother, deserves an award. He spends around 3-4 minutes without any cuts, screaming whilst driving around on his bike, screaming at his mother because Jarvis beat him up. Its more retarded than the worst chainsaw massacre scene with Rene Zellweger. It's the most annoying, horrific, mentally incompetent, loathsome family I've ever seen in movie history.

The acting is something you'd imagine barely scuffing the surface of 'TV' acting, although I understand the budgets for these films were always low. The director stays with the storyline of Tommy Jarvis (Jason's killer from the Final Chapter) now older and more insane than before thanks to Jason, Tommy is having hallucinations and is popping pills like crazy in order to relieve his 'mirages'. Now instead of Crystal Lake we as the audience are taken to an assisted living mental home. There are some 'decent' scares but overall this film is just another run-of-the-mill slasher.

Director Danny Steinmann had a reputation for making trashy films, including a pornographic one, and he brings some of that with him here making this Friday the 13th entry feel a bit more sleazier and mean spirited than previous movies.With an impressive amount of kills, although some not executed as well as Tom Savini would have done them, it gives fans what that want with the added mystery of whether we are seeing the real Jason doing the killing or not after his apparent demise in Part 4.Corey Feldman briefly reprises his role as Tommy in the pre-title sequence before we see a grown up Tommy played by another actor committed to a mental institution as flashbacks of Jason still haunt him and affects his behaviour. A series of brutal murders forces him to face reality as the famous hockey mask wrecks havoc once more.With dark humour, ramped up nudity and unlikeable characters, some a little cartoonish for my liking, this disappointed some fans but I think it just stays on the right side of being acceptable as an attempt to continue the Jason Voorhees legacy. A mention also has to go to the actress who plays Tina whose real name is Deborah Voorhees, I wonder if that's how she got the gig.There's another twist at the end of this one, like there was in Part 4, but it's less effective and predictable but overall I found it entertaining and well paced and Steinmann's skewed take on the franchise is a welcomed addition.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

178,BenTramerLives78,"Despite the Hate, It Is A Great Movie",9,21 December 2020,"Friday the 13th: A New Beginning wasn't supposed to happen. The previous film was titled ""The Final Chapter"", but the series was so successful and popular the inevitable happened. A New Beginning starts off with little Tommy Jarvis (Corey Feldman) being terrorized by the maniac Jason, but we see that it was just a dream and Tommy is now older and played by actor John Sheppard. Jason is dead. You know once a killer in a popular horror film dies, they can't come back, right?
Anyway, Tommy is put into a home for mentally ill youngsters and is obviously scarred by his past trauma. A mentally challenged boy is axed to death, not by Jason, while two girls from the home are watching. People are being offed one by one now and it looks as though Jason is back. But he's dead, remember?
This film is hard to explain without giving too much away, which is an odd thing to say about a Friday the 13th film, but this one has a twist. It's obvious, to me anyway, who the killer is pretty early on.
This was a unique entry in the horror series and one that many hate for that very reason. I think it is a great film even though it is different.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
179,fibreoptic,Has a nice twist at the end!,9,28 January 2004,"I first seen this movie about 15 years ago and quite liked it then and i sat down and watched it again the other day and i still liked it. Everything is nice and simple as a horror slasher movie should be with one or two inventive killings added to the usual carnage. The annoying and wild characters are all dealt with and a nice little twist at the end makes this a great little slasher flick. How i miss the low budgety non glamour slasher movies of the 80's but with all these modern Freddy Vs Jason, Scream & Jason X movies made for the mainstream horror fan it was really nice to watch Friday The 13th Part 5 (One of the few slasher movies i havn't watched to death). The actual title is kind of misleading because it's not really a new beginning as Part 6 explains but i guess when it first was released it made people talk about the end scene. Definately worth watching just to see Jason (i know i know but still is Jason for all intents and purposes) do his thing and kill annoying teenagers! nice ;o) 9/10",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
180,MovieKing-4,What is so bad about this film???,9,6 May 1999,"Friday the 13th is the best film of the series by far. But then when it comes to a choice of the best sequel, I say that Friday the 13th part 5 is the joint best sequel of the series.Part 4 the so called final chapter is equally as good.I take a look at other peoples comments about this film and it seems to me that I am one of the only people who likes this film.It has everything that the other sequels failed to capture. It had real suspense, as to who the killer was, I mean we all know it was not Jason, he ""was"" dead.It had a lot of different death scenes,and it was all in all a good film. it had the 3 rules for making a successful sequel..... 1)Body count is always bigger 2)The death scenes are more elaborate 3) Never ever ......... oh sorry back to the comments .....Thinking about it, the ending was kind of like a Scooby Doo ending, as to why he did it.The man responsible had a perfectly simple and plain motive, revenge.I`m not going to say what he wanted revenge for or who he was not it was simple.I kind of figured it out that the killer was not Jason, when he gets hurt by many objects you can hear him moan in pain, Jason is a member of the Living Dead Club, which means he is the living dead. And he don`t really feel pain.Tommy Jarvis returns in the film.Corey Feldman is also in it as well, but he has a sort of cameo role. I do not understand why Tommy is in a mental Institute, I mean he is still freaked out by the murder of his mother and friends at the hands of Jason Voorhees.So if you want to find out who killer is and why he did it, then rent out this film or if you`re a horror fan like me, buy it and add it to your horror collection.I give this movie a 8 out of 10.Because of the Crazy ""new beginning"". well it has not really got a new beginning but it is a Pun ........get it????Do Not worry.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

I begged my father to take me again and the only thing that changed his mind was in the Rated R description it stated in our Vancouver Paper Frequent Gory Violence.....Okay since there was no nudity and sex he took me to it. Well lets just say thank God my dad fell asleep in the theatre due to a heavy work week because when Debissue Voorhees unveiled her assets in a long sex scene filled with nudity, I became a big ( no pun intended ) fan of hers and woman of that body type.

Why you ask? Because Jason's not the killer big whoopie. Jason also wasn't the killer in number 1. But as we all know, people still complain about it.Now, even though the killer wasn't jason, the body count in this movie is still pretty frickin high. like 20 high. And that's pretty good for a guy who's NOT Jason. Actually, that's the highest body count up until then. In the later movies Jason had to work on catching up to Roy. And that's pretty damn cool.Plotwise it's like this. Tommy has grown up since the 4th movie and is in a halfway house for crazy people. Right before he gets there though one of the people living there is busy chopping wood in the stupidest way possible and after the fat kid annoys him, he kills the fat kid. (rubs temple) who was the GENIUS who gave the kid in the halfway house for crazy people an AXE?! WHO thought that would be a good idea?! Anyway, Tommy arrives and is socially awkward as he sees visions of Jason everywhere. And lo and behold a Jason shows up and starts to kill people! oh snap! So after a whole bunch of honestly, pretty cool killings, Tommy, a black kid, and a girl finish off the Jason lookalike, who happens to be really a paramedic Roy, the father of the kid who got axed.Tommy ends up in hospital with the jason mask and they act as if he's going to kill the girl. But they don't ever touch upon this again because jason 6 basically ignores jason 5. But that's OK.Jason 5 was a very good movie. Even though it technically isn't acknowledged in the series, that's fine with me. it's still a very suspenseful very fun slasher film. it's actually one of my favorites along with 3 and 6. The rest are kind of meh, but 3, 5, and 6 are all worth a watch.If you're looking for a good slasher movie, don't listen to the hype and pop in Friday the 13th part 5. you'll be glad you did.Friday the 13th part 5 gets 7 crazy paramedics, out of 10.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
190,pleiades10,Gotta give them credit for trying something new.,6,15 August 2000,"That's not easy when you have four preceding movies that all operate within the same basic parameters, but the filmmakers did decide to steer the Friday the 13th movies into a new direction somewhat.The story takes places 10 years or so after The Final Chapter, and Tommy Jarvis has been placed in a mental hospital, still trying to recover from the horror he experienced dealing with Jason Voorhees. An isolated violent incident results in a bloody death in the first few minutes, then additional deaths happen one by one in very graphic fashion. (case in point: the girl and the pruning shears.)The filmmakers return to the spirit of the original in that you have no idea who the killer is, and he/she/them are not identified, or even shown in the actual act of killing until the ending.There are clues dropped as to the killer's identity, and after you see the film once, it will seem painfully obvious who the killer is upon later watchings. But during that first viewing, it could be a number of suspects... perhaps the redneck hillbilly woman who doesn't want those crazy kids in her back yard. Or maybe it's the military looking inmate whom started this whole mess. Maybe Tommy Jarvis is acting out his aggressions, or perhaps he is possessed by the spirit of Jason himself!I once read that this movie was supposed to be the first in a series of Friday the 13ths involving mysterious killers that adopt the Jason Voorhees persona. They were to feature a new killer, with a new story and background for each future film. I like this idea. I like to be kept guessing. However, most fans did not like this entry, and the mysterious identity direction was scrapped in favor of returning Jason to the spotlight.See the later films, and decide for yourself whether this was a good idea or not.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
191,jhigginbotham151,Enjoyable even without Jason,6,11 May 2014,"This film was clearly trying to take the series in a new direction, with Jason used as a cover up for another killers murders. It didn't do as well as the previous installments and Jason was brought back for part 6, however I do think this is a very enjoyable installment in the series, and I do appreciate how the filmmakers have tried to inject some originality into what I think, was going to be a completely new series.The film follows a grown up Tommy Jarvis who is now haunted by dreams and visions of Jason Voorhees. He is sent to a mental house where Jason- like murders start occurring. Is Jason back?, is it just a copycat killer? or is it Tommy who's doing all the killing.Thats what I like about the film, but also what I think pulls it down. The way they show Tommy going ever so slightly insane from all the death and visions of Jason is really well done. The way they never show who the killer is, never even showing a full body shot is also really intriguing as they never let you know, never even giving hints as to who the killer is. However, this means the deaths aren't as brutal as they have been in the past and would be in the future. It also doesn't come to much as the reveal at the end is underwhelming and could be the reason that many fans don't like this film.The characters are all pretty likable to a certain extent and of course you do have the douche-bags that you know for sure are going to get killed. I think by this point, knowing a character is going to die is part of the fun. You take a certain amount of pleasure in knowing that this character, a person who although may be a complete jerk, has never done anything bad in their lives, is going to be brutally murdered by a machete wielding nut case.

The script writers and crew were faithful to the source material making this a great film story wise.It manages to hold enough suspense to keep you watching, Tommy and his delusions also crank up the tension just enough to keep an edge.WARNING!

This is the only one since the first in which (spoilers) Jason kills no one.  This is also the only one besides the first one in which nothing supernatural happens giving us a break from the perhaps overused ""unstoppable zombie killer"" routine that is used in both the Friday series and the Halloween series.  I like both kinds of movies but this was a nice diversion from the norm.

It certainly adds interests to the series.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
194,MissCzarChasm,"Ok for What it Tried to do, but still more of the Same",6,30 April 2002,"I honestly wish they would've ended this series after the 4th installment, which was a pretty good note to end on. However, studios are money hungry in Hollywood, and they wanted to continue to cash in on the horror craze that was still in full swing in the 80's. In order to put some life into an aging series they decided to do something different with the 5th installment of this series. For the most part this works and in my opinon it works a hell of a lot better than the zombie jason featured in 6-10.
I honestly don't know why fans hate this entry so much. It's slightly and i do mean slightly more original than most of the sequels in the series and they had to do something fresh to make the series interesting again. This is an interesting shift and i appreciate the attempt to make something different.In that aspect i appreciate the film and it's probably the last Friday the 13th film i liked for more than its making fun of it value. However, in the end this is more of the same. Bad acting, characters just in it to be killed, and the same stalk/chase scenes to be presented in all films of this sort. The only thing original about the film is the concept, and that's about it.The only performance worth mentioning is the lead. His acting goes beyond that of a horror film. He should be in better movies, not in something like this. Other than this performance all the rest are just there for the kill and bring nothing interesting to there characters. The setting in the institution is a nice touch but it's handled so unrealisticly that it becomes hilarious to watch. Jason is a bit of a threat in this film only because the new direction the character takes in this film.I appreciate this film for the new idea alone. I think the filmmakers knew what they had to do to make something after a 4th film called THE FINAL CHAPTER. The same slasher antics are used which prevent the film from becoming a really good horror film but it wasn't a bad way to waste 90 minutes, unlike the next sequels that followed it.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

Overall I think this is easily the most entertaining Friday film. It's terrible, but amusingly so. This movie averages more than one corpse every 5 minutes.This time around we have a group of teens with psychological problems staying at some isolated treatment center. They wander around freely, so it's sort of another camp scenario. We have the usual stereotypes substituting for actual characters. The stutterer. The new wave chick. The horny couple. A corny hillbilly mother and son. The furious mayor. A guy whose entire character is defined by his reading a porn mag and making a lewd gesture at the beginning, and then later snorting coke. A pair of rockabilly dudes, one of whom wanders into the forest to defecate (that was unexpected, as people outdoors generally wander off to take a leak, instead). We also meet a waitress who spontaneously flashes her chest in the mirror for no reason (one assumes the director was under pressure to meet a breast quota). Of course, there is a thunderstorm throughout the climax of the film. The movie also features Dudley (of ""Diff'rent Strokes"") and two cast members from Return of the Living Dead. That right there is a good enough reason to watch F13 part 5. And the stiff acting of the grey haired cop is also pretty funny.I find it ridiculous that some F13 fans hate this movie because the real Jason is not in it.

The opening scene is incredibly dumb. 2 kids go to Jason's grave(which is out in the forest) and they dig him up. Jason wakes up and kills the kids and then kills some kid in a rain coat.

199,Kelly G.,Simply the worst. The VERY worst.,2,22 February 1999,"Any horror fan worth their salt most certainly has their own opinion as to which films in this series are good and which are bad. Well, here's my two cents.In this entry, Tommy, the kid who ""killed"" Jason in the last film, is sent to a psychiatric facility which for some reason is right next to Crystal Lake. After the vicious axe murder of one of the other patients, police begin to suspect that Jason is back from the grave.This is the first entry in the series to throw a lot of humor into the mix. Not a bad idea since this concept stopped being frightening halfway through Part 3. Unfortunatly the humor here is needlessly mean-spirited in tone, focusing almost entirely on the crude actions of gross characters. It's almost like a low-grade Troma flick. (I know some people will take that as a reccomendation.) Most of the gore here is left to cutaway shots that leave us seeing only the grisly aftermaths, while even the most dense movie-goer could figure out who the killer REALLY is. It's not like the director puts the camera RIGHT ON THE GUY FOR SEVERAL SECONDS with the soundtrack going BUM! BUM!

200,lonchaney20,Hilarious but ultimately dissatisfying entry in the series...,6,15 May 2010,"I know a lot of people hate this movie because it doesn't have the real Jason, but I think that's the least of its problems. For one thing, we never really follow any one character enough to consider them the protagonist. You'd think Tommy Jarvis would be it, but he's barely in the movie! The good news is that there are two awesome scenes of him totally owning some poor guys with his crazy martial arts, but these scenes (along with just about any other from the film!) also demonstrate everything that's wrong with the film: it's too silly and over-the-top, to the point that it becomes annoying (mainly during any scene featuring ""Ma"" and ""Junior"", arguably the worst characters in Friday history). While it's supposed to be sort of a whodunit, it never really works because we're given no real suspects or good red herrings. In my opinion they should have based the film around the idea that everyone thinks Jarvis is doing it (which would've made for a better angle with more conflict), or better suggested that Jason had come back to life. This might have made the ending more surprising. Of course, might also have helped if the killer hadn't just been some random dude with a lame motive (or rather a poorly developed motive). While the original Friday the 13th doesn't exactly work as a whodunit either, it compensates by having an interesting actor and character for the killer. As it stands, anyone could have been the killer and it wouldn't have made a difference.This film seems to have a significantly higher body count than the previous entries, but kind of screws it up by not showing anything. They didn't show much in number 2 either, but that film was also significantly more suspenseful (and had much better developed and more likable characters). While the lack of gore is the MPAA's fault, the lack of suspense is still the director's screw up. After all, both Friday the 13th Part II and My Bloody Valentine are great movies even with the gore cut out, but this is merely serviceable.All that said, there were some pretty funny moments that made it worth watching. My favorite is probably Vic's reaction to Joey asking if he can help him chop wood (which is infinitely harsher than one would expect!) And I also liked the Reggie character, mainly because he was Dudley on Diff'rent Strokes (you know, the kid that got molested by the bicycle man?) And Corey Feldman at the start doesn't hurt either, even if all he does is stand in front of the camera with a dumbfounded look on his face.Anyway, it has its moments, but you might as well just skip ahead to number 6.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
201,The Bronson Fan,A truly bad film that's one of biggest train wrecks you can't miss.,6,20 August 2007,"Friday the 13th V among fans has gone down as the worst of the series because of the absence of Jason. Although this film is very bad it's just that what makes it so dam good. The story starts out with a cameo appearance by Cory Feldman playing Tommy Jarvis but it turns out this is only a dream and he wakes up. Tommy (Shepherd) now older, not sure how old and in great shape, is being sent to a halfway house for mental patients, I'm guessing around the area of Crystal Lake. As you go further in, this movie gets worse by the minute. Soon we are introduced to some characters, some retarded kids and the best being a mother and son pair of hillbillies that live in the area and hate the retarded kids who live there. They are by far the best part of this film. Apparently all the kids are on the honor system to be good and not misbehave. So a nut like this guy Vick, a patient there is allowed to chop wood with a large ax.yea I'll buy that. Not surprising a fat mentally challenged boy named Joey offers Vick a candy bar and is denied and hacked to pieces. So one of the paramedics seems to be sickened by the scene, while the other seems to enjoy the carnage. A medic? Soon after we start to see the body count rise. But who is doing that's the big mystery. As if one couldn't figure it out. The local sheriff, who is a complete joke and can't act, proclaims it's Jason who has been dead for some time. OH MY it gets better. Let's see Jason really kills a lot of people in this, most deserving it. Some memorable kills would be the road flare, the belt, hedge clippers, motorcycle beheading, and of course the outhouse. Eventually Jason kills off most of the mental patients and we're left with one of the watchers Pam and a black kid named Reggie (Ross), one of the few bright spots of the movie. So of course Jason attempts to kill them, while Reggie continues to scream like a high pitched girl.one of the funniest parts in the film. So some how Jason manages to catch up with them even though their running and he's not. Stupid! Soon they get to a barn, Reggie manages to drive a back ho into him, though he gets up and pursues. But now Tommy comes out of no where and confronts him, a struggle ensues Tommy gets whipped but they all team up on Jason sending him on to some sharp farm equipment. Now we find out that it was not Jason but a guy named Roy the medic, who son was apparently Billy and he when nuts when he saw him slaughtered. The ending is truly bad, showing Tommy taking over the role of Jason. Bad ending. Bad film.OK there's no question this film is bad. But this film is so funny for so many reasons. The acting is horrendous even more so than usual in these films, but since I don't watch a Friday movie for acting who really cares right? The story is bad but not as much as the Friday fans will tell you. Who cares if Jason is not in the movie? He wasn't really in the original either and if you know anything about mass murders there often is a copy cat killer, so cool it people. But it's easy to tell who the killer is so that part of the story is stupid. There are so many funny parts in this film.let me review and laugh. 1. As stated before why would a place for mental patients allow one of them to have an ax? Not just one, but one who obviously has a few anger management problems and looks like he wants to kill you. 2. The medic's scene is stupid. How many medics would actually get a kick out of coming to a gruesome scene where a boy was just hacked to pieces? As the one says ""get your hands dirty"" I think not. 3. What's up with the greasers who come out of no where just to be killed? Apparently if you follow the time line of the movies, this film takes place in the 90's and even in the 80's 2 greasers would have been totally out of place. Can you say happy days? 4. I love the part when the playboy takes one of Tommy's masks and he slams the cream puff (so would I). 5. Of course the hillbillies are the best part and the vagrant visitor who is just looking to fill his stomach and Ethel is nice enough to feed him if he cleans the crap out behind the chicken coup. 6. What about Demon (Miguel Núñez Jr)? Anything this guy has been in is at least funnystreet fighter anyone? ""Oh those dam enchiladas LOL then gets killed in the outhouse after singing with his woman. 7. Possibly the best part in the film, ""he hurt me ma!"" and the true retard gets beheaded on his motorcycle while his mother makes his stew (flavor added). 8 Watch the greatest shoot down in history when Robin shoots down Jake stuttering about who asks her to make love to him. LOL down in flames. 9. Who could forget watching Reggie get chased by Jason and screaming like a girl. 10. One of the dumbest things about this film is how Jason walks around while they run and yet he catches them. Soooooo stupid! OK so yes this will go down as the Halloween 3 and Nightmare 2 of the series, but if you can't laugh at how bad this film is your not gonna laugh at much. As a Friday movie this is bad, and basically this one big goof, but I have to give it a 6 for being so dam funny.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
202,Duzniak38,Jason Sits This One Out,10,3 August 2006,"Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning. This sequel is actually one of the best in my opinion, except for the lousy ending. Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning does everything correctly, through the first three quarters of the movie. We start off with the plot of Tommy Jarvis being sent to a halfway house for troubled teens, and there he is plagued by visions of Jason Voorhees. So we now have a fresh twist that the movie isn't to be set about cabins in the woods again, which is a breath of fresh air. Then, we have the absolutely fantastic array of characters, all of which are rememberal and great to watch. Ethel and Junior provide comical relief as the hillbilly mother and son, we feel sympathy for Jake, Violet and Robin, who are all great people to watch interact. The characters are all interesting, and all have their own personal traits which makes them work, instead of them all just wanting to party, drink, smoke and have sex, so this is also a step in a new direction. Out of all of the Friday the 13th instalments, Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning probably has the most memorable characters, and some fantastic scenes with them, for example when Anita and Demon sing whilst he is on the toilet, or when Violet is dancing the robot. Friday the 13th does have some very memorable and inventive death scenes as well, although plot holes and continuity issues do fall through think and fast. There is some nudity as well, mainly from Debbie Sue Voorhees, which is very enjoyable. The script can get very lame, for instance the conversations between Billy and Lana. However the twist ending is that Jason Voorhees wasn't behind these murders, but it was instead a copycat who was killing off the teens after his estranged son was hacked up at that very same halfway house. This is quite a let down, but seriously, don't let this put you completely off. Jason takes a vacation, but this filler still delivers the goods.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
203,thetheonly,Where's Jason?,5,4 October 2019,This film and this is not a spoiler at this point doesn't feature the master of hacking and slashing Jason Voorhees. Outside of that its ok. I wont go over the synopsis since there are a lot of reviews that already have but instead I will focus on what the movie succeeds at and fails at. The movie first has good gore and special effects with some cool kills. It also succeeds at having a cool twist and continuing the story in a different direction that isn't too bad. The movie does fail at a few different things. First its a really standard slasher that borrows the Friday the 13th name and really under any other name would have been forgotten about in the 80s. Also not all of the characters are very likable and on top of that some of the performances are phoned in. Overall a really meh film,Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

Even that one's only mistake was too much rehashing of the original. This one is all about the movie's star character ""Jason Voorhees"" killing everyone he can find for no apparent reason. At least part 3 had an amusing plot. The only remotely interesting thing in this movie is the more gruesome killing tactics. Definitely if there was a level above violent, this would be it. That the was only thing that kept me amused enought not to shut it off. I will agree with some of the other commentators on this movie, in that it should be seen. I am a big fan of sequels, even when there bad, don't own them but have at least seen'em. Don't waste money on this.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

It is a by the book, Friday the 13th movie. It is as Friday the 13th as you can be. Very true to brand. The kills are great. The movie is very violent. Reggie the Reckless is an icon to me. Very inspirational and he held his own. Why was he screaming like that though?Negatives
Jason feels very off. If you've seen the movie, you know why.. Alot of the characters were just weird to me. It was almost too many weird characters. I guess they are supposed to be weird, but I don't know. The ending is weird. I see what they were going for...wait nevermind...I didn't get it. I respect them trying something different, but it just doesn't work.Overall, it is a unique movie while also being formulaic.

Even though it's not Jason in this movie, it doesn't mean Jason's basic appearance isn't in the movie.Jason is shown through several fantasies looking very terrifying with the red stripes on his hockey mask. In the movie's reality, the hockey mask has black stripes.

Some things i didn't like from the movie is that there is a lot of nudity Tina is okay, Lana and Robin, why? Another thing, why did he killed Violet, that is so unfair! because, she is cool, pretty and does robot dancing very well! I just think is one of the best movies in Friday the 13th saga. Juliette Cummins was the perfect actress to play Robin, she's pretty as Tiffany is, Robin died with the machete stabbed in her chest when she was lying down in her bed, predictable, isn't it? Besides of all of this, Ethel (Carol Locatell) didn't deserve to die, she was so gross with that vocabulary but anyway she didn't deserve it, she was cooking an excellent stew for his son, obviously he died, too, an suddenly Jason stabs the machete in Ethel's head and her head fell in the stew. what a creepy scene!

The Story would have worked if it didn't seem like the actors and film makers themselves weren't sure that it was going to work because everyone knew Jason was dead, and it was too obvious from the start that Jason wasn't really ""Jason"". Only visible in 'visions' for the first half of the film, and in part one style we never get to see the killer's face till the end, revealing the infamous hockey mask, maybe they thought we'd want it so bad, that we'd forget that we already knew it wasn't Jason.

Others say ""Jason X"" is not part of the Friday the 13th cannon. While I disagree with their opinions on those two films, I dare not object when someone tells me that Friday the 13th: A New Beginning should have been aborted.The story picks up several years after the events of the so-called ""Final Chapter"". Tommy Jarvis is now a young adult and is living with the memories of that fateful night when he encountered Jason Voorhees. He has nightmares where Jason returns seeking revenge and apparently is suffering from several mental disorders. He is taken to a home for troubled youngsters where he will be given treatment, therapy and most importantly a second chance. Shortly after he arrives, one of the patients is brutally slaughtered by an employee. Not too long after that, several Jason style murders occur. Is Tommy's imagination playing tricks on him again? Is Jason really back from the dead? I think it's pretty clear that everybody now knows the answer to that question.The acting is typical of a Friday film, and by that I mean what acting? The kills are actually pretty good and were one of only a handful of reasons for me not giving this film an even lower rating. I love the one where the guy is in the crapper, that's just priceless! In all honesty, the movie could have been worse I suppose. It kind of reminds me of the infamous ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" because it would have worked so much better had it been a standalone film with nothing to do with Jason (although technically is DIDN'T have anything to do with the REAL Jason).

219,rexmagicman,"When you say and read something often enough, you'll soon believe it...........",8,4 August 2021,".....and I think that's the problem with this movie. It got a bad reputation right from the start from critics when it was released, though audiences flocked to it and gave it a very solid opening weekend and overall box-office success.I'm a big fan of all the ""Friday the 13th"" movies, including this one. I give it a solid ""8"", more like ""8 1/2"". These movies were meant to be popcorn and candy fodder, a way to escape into theatres and forget about work and whatever --- ""Doctor Zhivago"" or ""Gone With the Wind"" they were never trying to be. They're supposed to have identifiable characters you can keep track of, somewhat of a plot, and some gore --- and this movie checks all those off, and then-some. Lots of red herrings and jump moments throughout. Good cinematography, and of course the extremely moody/scary music by Harry Manfredini.I was a senior in high school when Part 1 came out, and then just starting college when the sequels began, living at home so I could pay my own way through school. The youngest of five kids, my folks were in their 50s when the sequels started, and my mother went to most of them with me as I usually went alone during opening day between work and school, and I think she just wanted to get out of the house. My mother was smart enough to figure out that this series couldn't keep going the way it was if it were to survive --- ""you gotta' keep 'em guessing"", she used to say. And she and I particularly enjoyed this one, as you were really surprised when the ending came about, and it WASN'T Jason!! Fun characters throughout (Shavar Ross was a standout, I thought -- and my mother loved Carol Locatell as ""Ethel"" and Ron Sloan as ""Junior"", said they reminded her of some of her relatives, which I found frightening....), a high body-count, and some graphic on-screen killings in addition to ones off-screen.A week after my mom and I saw this, she actually wanted to see it again to see if there were any signs or giveaways as to who the killer was before the big reveal --- we went, and upon the 2nd viewing, there really ARE signs from the beginning that Roy is the killer --- almost hard to believe you could miss them. Of course, the ""why"" isn't so obvious until the end when it's explained.My mom continued to see all of them with me and understood and liked the creative way they continued the series until the end --- she got it, I got it...I wish other people would as well, as they're fun films for a rainy or Halloween night, with this one being right up there with the rest.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

They open it, and Jason springs to life, ending the lives of the desecrators. Then Jason's gaze turns to Tommy, and he raises the machete high over Tommy's head. . .Tommy, now a teenager, wakes up drenched with sweat in a van from the Unger Institute of Mental Health. Tommy soon arrives at his destination, a halfway home for troubled teens. Tommy is brought into Matt Peters' office, where the doctor explains that the clinic is run on an honor system, with the intention of preparing the patients to re-enter society. Tommy then meets young Reggie, whose grandfather George works at the house.Sheriff Tucker and his deputy return patients Tina and Eddie to the institute. Following close on their heels are Ethel and ""Junior"" Hubbard, whose property adjoins the halfway house. The foul-mouthed Ethel raises Hell about the kids again having sex on her property. Ethel's fears about the ""loonies"" are justified in short order when the anti-social Vic hacks up Joey with an Axe. Vic is arrested by the police and ambulance attendants Duke Johnson and Roy Burns come to take away the corpse.Night comes and the murders begin. Greaser Vinnie and Pete are viciously dispatched with a road flare and a machete. The next morning Tommy hallucinates Jason standing behind him. At breakfast, Tommy beats Eddie senseless when Eddie wears a mask Tommy made. Has Tommy become the killer he fears? Or is it the drifter that shows up at Ethel's house looking for work? That night the murders continue when waitress Lana and her boyfriend Billy are viciously murdered with an Axe.The next day, patients Tina and Eddie sneak off into the woods to have sex. The drifter watches them intently, but he is soon struck down by the killer, as are Eddie and Tina. That night Pam drives Reggie to see his brother Demon, with along Tommy along for the ride. As Reggie and Demon catch up on old times Tommy is accosted by Junior. Tommy again loses control and pummels Junior, running off when interrupted by Pam. When Pam and Reggie return to the house, Demon and his girlfriend Anita are killed. Soon after, Junior and Ethel Hubbard are killed as well.Pam goes to look for Tommy but the killer is at the house, killing patients Jake, Robin and Violet.

They flee into the woods and come across the body of ambulance driver Duke Johnson as well as that of Dr. Peters.

I don't mind the fact that Jason sits this movie out, and I think that it's ridiculous how many people get worked up over a silly little plot twist like that. However, Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning is a VERY bad movie none the less, but that is the light and magic of it.The movie starts off with a dream sequence of the returning character from the previous film (Tommy Jarvis). I thought that this was the only scene in the entire movie that supplied any suspense at all. We are then introduced to the characters. Basically, ever actor in this movie did an absolutely terrible job. Every line delivered was very laughable, and for that reason, this has to be one of the funniest movies I've ever seen in my entire life. Just the fact that this movie was meant to be frightening is strange to me.Die hard fans of the series will not like this movie for the unintended humor and the lack of Jason, but anybody looking for any small glimmer of entertainment value can appreciate Friday the 13th Part V for what it is; an absolutely terrible piece of crap.FOR IN DEPTH HORROR REVIEWS, CHECK OUT MY YOUTUBE CHANNEL: HORRORRREVIEWS123.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

The pacing was done well, the kills were creative and there's a lot of nudity, which is what the Friday the 13th movies are known forTommy Jarvis is extremely boring I'm glad they recasted him in part 6 with Thom Matthews because this man who plays him is a snooze fest..I also don't get why they chose the paramedic to be the copycat killer, and he decided to kill everyone but the man who murdered his son. I think they should've picked a different character that we would care about or even really remember, but oh well. overall I would say this is a good film in the franchise. It would've been interesting to see what would've happened if they made part 6 how it should've been based on this ending, but I'm kinda glad they didn't cause part 6 is my favorite.If you catch A new beginning on tv you should watch it if you're a fan of these kind of movies",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

After ""The Final Chapter"" it looks like an attempt to find a new direction for franchise, which is a little bit refreshing. Another point of attraction is the characters. And even some of them presented in comical manner, it is anyway better than another bunch of horny teenagers. The most favorable character is, of course, Tommy Jarvis himself, with his hallucinations and inner craziness. There's also a lot of nudity (perhaps more than in any other part of series), and lots of killing (actually, several minor characters introduced in only one sequence just for get killed after 1-2 minutes on screen), so I guess slasher fans will not be totally disappointed.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

The entire film tries impossibly hard to make the film different, but the end product is exactly the same. The opening dream sequence provided suspense, but the rest of the movie wasn't scary at all. Movie really suffered from MPAA cuts which made nearly every death scene occur off-screen (although one death scene in particular was executed perfectly). Despite the cuts, the film has a crazy amount of at least twenty death scenes. And what the hell was up with the Michael Jackson wannabe? Film never really gave the attention to Tommy it deserves, giving ample amounts of screen time to horny teenagers lined up to be slaughtered. Its also littered with unbelievable dark humor that honestly demeans mentally handicapped people, although its impossible to not laugh at the fate of Joey. Don't really care if Jason was in it, but they could have come up with a better story than a copy cat killer who only provides us with one scene to gather clues from; although I liked the idea of his jaded blue eyes being the same as the stripes on the killer's hockey mask.

So part 5 does not actually have Jason as the killer it's a guy named Roy who's son Joey was murdered at the halfway house by another guy named Vic who hit Joey in the back with an axe which was the start of the awesome kills in this movie. A lot of people take issue with the fact that it was Roy pretending to be Jason instead of it act being Jason but if you follow the series from the first movie until now it's actually pretty cool they did this. This movie is the first in the franchise to have a bunch of really dark humor in my opinion which was great & made the movie that much better. This film also has 19 awesome kills which is the 2nd highest behind jason goes to hell. I am a huge horror/slasher movie fan I grew up watching Friday The 13th, A Nightmare On Elm St, Halloween, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre ect... but this film has some of the best special effects of any slasher ever the kills in this film are so creative & fun to watch. I also think the whole halfway house setting was a really cool change. Again I am glad to finally see this movie start getting the credit it deserves the new generation of fans have helped a lot with that. Also check out a documentary called Crystal lake memories you can stream it or buy it on Blu-ray it is really long like 6+ hours long but it goes into so much detail about each film that it's worth it.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

It's at the bottom of my list as one of my favorites right above Jason Goes To Hell. The story isn't all that bad, it's just the lack of blood when someone gets their head split open and the acting is pretty bad.

230,cplchrisusmc02,What a waste,1,16 February 2004,"Ok so if you saw Halloween 3: Seaon of the Witch, and liked it, then this movie is for you. But if you didn't, get ready for another huge disappointment.Its been five years since Jason was killed and Tommy is off to another institution. This one is full of, once again, teenagers and staff. Now, Tommy is totally obsessed with Jason. He is a very quiet, down to earth type of guy. The rest of the patients thinks he very very out there. So, after the fat kid dies, the kids start dropping off one by one. Once again, sex and drugs are the biggest breakdowns for these kids. You don't have a complete movie without a couple of hicks inside your movie. Through in Ethel and her wonderfully disguisting son and you got a class B movie. They die also, if case if you wanna know. So, Pam, Tommy, and Reggie are the only ones running from Jason and running and running and it seems like you can't even stop this guy even hitting him with a bulldozer. So what do you do? You climb up to the top of a barn and hide until he is close to the edge and then you push him over it and there you go, the entire movie is over, but wait, they are way to curious and gotta see him just dead down there where the hand comes outta nowhere and Reggie is screaming like a little girl, Tommy grabs a knife and chops off his hand sending Jason to his death. Ironically enough, there is a bed of sharp sticks at the bottom and Jason dies. Then to make it a shocker you find out its the parademic the entire time??? Who the hell cares? He is getting revenge on everybody because his son was sliced up by the maniac chopping wood? Why wouldn't you kill him? Why kill the entire clan? So then the hospital seen where Tommy breaks the window, Pam comes into the room and finds Tommy gone, where he shuts the door and has the mask on and a knife. Come on!!!This movie is just terrible for anyone. I don't even own this movie and I own like every horror film. There is absolutely no point to this. If they really thought they were going to get Tommy to play Jason from there on out, the franchise would have been outta business from the sequel of that one. What were they thinking is the only question that I have for them!!1.5 out of 10",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
231,jennys-saviour,The most existential Slasher to have been made. Warning *Spoilers,8,18 January 2002,"Back in the 80's when horror films where everywhere. One film series was (financially anyway) running all over the others. That was Friday the 13th.The best of them was Friday the 13th Part 4. So good because the emphasis of the film was not on teenagers and sex and pointless sub-plots. But on death and the fear of death coming out into the world unrestricted by anything at all.The next best of these was Friday the 13th Part 5, A new beggining. Why??? When so many other people have bagged it. Because, when it comes down to it, its really alot darker and more disturbed then any other slashers that are made (bar non-slasher specific horror films). The lead character is violent and mentally disturbed. He is the begginings of a psychopathic personality. His name is Tommy and he isnt going camping or meeting friends at school. He is in a mental home isolated in a small country town which could never exist in the real world. Only in a horror world could this town exist.There are no normal characters in this film. The murders are bloody and agressively violent. The directing is much better then the films that came after it and for the most part the films that came before it. The photography and camerawork in Part 5 are excellent and really give Friday the 13th its definitive look. Faded browns and dusty greens.The murders are not so seperate from the rest of the film in this one. They are not the only point of interest. And when the finale happens it is not just a protracted chase sequence, it really is a massacre. Finally when Jason is killed it isnt simply the invincible monster being stopped for good. It is another murder of another person. Shot really effectively in terms of effect beyond just a ""good wins over evil climax"".In terms of slasher films it has more deaths by far than most slashers offer. The situations the murders occur in are sleazy and demented, Really alot of this film displays a terror of the outside world and the danger it can pose.The acting in this film is also alot better then most of the Friday the 13ths (and most slashers in general and I am including all the Scream,I know what you did last summer movies.I think anyone with an interest in psychology and films should watch this. The script doesnt have it but the feelings raised within the film by the film and its makers (possibly subconciously) do.Second best Friday the 13th

Although the setting isn't a camp, the acting of many was very campy.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
234,TitusYorick,The worst Friday the 13th ever,1,6 August 2006,"This movie is an example to the entire business that just because you can continue a series doesn't mean you should. The first Friday the 13th was brilliant and well written with enough stereotypical displays of teens. The second was pretty interesting with the return of Jason Voorhees to society. The third was symbolic to the series as being the introduction to the Hocky Mask. And the fourth should have ended the series, which is what it tried to do (hense the title ""The Final Chapter"").This movie, on the other hand, was a travesty and if you look at it at the right angle that was actually a compliment. First of all, the continuation of a character was not anything they had done in the movies save the brief presence of Alice Hardy in the ""Part 2"" but that appearance was justified after she gets an ice pick rammed through her skull. Having the Tommy Jarvis character come back with psychological problems was a big mistake. Just the fact that the copycat wearing the Hockey Mask imitating Jason Voorhees was at the same rehabilitation clinic that Tommy was staying was bad writing. A better story would have been to have Tommy go to the clinic and then hear about a copycat terrorizing people in another county miles away, which would lead to him committing suicide. But no, they had to have him save the day like he did in ""The Final Chapter"" and could this method have been any more cheesier? Who in their right of mind would put a bed of spikes outside a barn where a Hockey Mask wearing copycat could easily fall to his death . . . and what would a farmer need one for anyway?The other thing I hated about this movie was the music. The guy who did the music (Harry Manfredini) was definitely a bad choice, regardless of the fact he did the music for part's one, two and four. The music was loud, out of tune and most of all, out of place. I mean, who puts fast and suspenseful music in a scene where a bunch of people are driving to a trailer park? In my mind I could always hear the announcer from the old Batman shows saying something like ""What's this? Possible Postmortem Persons Speeding Steadily to the Sinister Slasher?"" . . . watch the show once or twice and then watch that part and you'll get it. The scene would have been more suspenseful if they hadn't included any music at all . . . or better yet, just not filmed a twenty-five second driving scene.And another thing, could they have gotten a more annoying kid for the movie? He was loud, immature and he screamed with the pitch that could have shattered my eardrum if I had listened to it any longer than I had to. Also, what kind of a kid has the ability or even the basic knowledge to know how to operate a tractor let alone plow it into a serial killer? Also, what kind of a kid has the bravery to stick around a scene where a serial killer is stalking him, especially if the place is a barn filled with pointed objects just waiting to impale him (not that they did, unfortunately). I understand that he was a kid and that most kids in movies have script immunity in terms of being killed, but there should have been an exception in his case.And of course, what slasher movie would be complete without a hillbilly with a retarded son? That scene where the guy arrives at their doorstep looking for food just should not have been in the movie. The lady's voice was even more annoying than the kid's and the retarded son seemed to have the right IQ to have been the copycat Jason Voorhees. Whenever I watch that scene I always have the urge to stick the barrel of a Glock 23 in my mouth with the safety off.I still watch this movie a lot though, mainly for a cheap laugh. I also had an epiphany while watching this movie one day after I got home from a bad day at work. And the epiphany is this - The Friday the 13th series is a great series to have when you're feeling down because it's a clear fact that the people getting killed in the movie are having a much worse day than you are.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
235,Trooper8-2,Not as bad as everyone says,5,20 February 2000,"WARNING: SPOILER AHEADAfter reading all of the negative reviews about this movie I don't think it's being given a fair treatment.  As most people already know, Jason is not the killer in this one.  That is obviously the reason most people don't like it.  If you can get past the lack of Jason, I don't think this movie is any worse than any of the other Friday the 13th movies.  In fact, it contains a number of very cool death scenes and the story is actually pretty good in my opinion.  If Jason had been the killer but otherwise this movies had been the same I think that this would be considered as good as any of the other movies.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

That is saying something with a franchise that has Jason X in Freddy vs Jason in.Still enjoyable, but I found myself bored and confused at times.Effects are pretty much none existent. Most kills are off camera. Hardly any gore at all for a slasher movie. Acting isn't as bad as other movies within the franchise but still leaves a lot to be desired. The characters don't seem to have any back story at all. Not to mention the story. It's very poorly written. You can see the twist from a mile away but the way it plays out doesn't make sense at all.Still enjoyed it, but definitely wouldn't recommend to someone that isn't into slasher movies.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
237,The_Eighth_Passenger,Very poor effort.,3,12 December 2009,"**This review contains major SPOILERS**After well and truly offing Jason with a few dozen machete blows to the head in Part 4, the so called 'Final Chapter', producers realised that there was still money to be milked from the cash-cow and so green lit the next instalment, 'A New Beginning'. However, this time the formula is mixed up a bit; we now have a copycat killer instead of Jason and also our first recurring character (that doesn't get killed off before the opening credits at least) in Tommy Jarvis. He is now a young adult and played by a below-average-even-for-the-genre John Shepard.After a dream sequence (yawn) the film starts with Tommy being transported to a halfway house of sorts, after spending years in institutions he is now ready to start making the transition to normal life. However, when horny teens left, right and centre start turning up dead, Tommy realises that his battle with Jason may not yet be over and he stands up again to fight the hockey masked maniac.Danny Steinmann directed the picture and from looking at his resume I can see this was the last film he ever had any creative involvement with. I'm not the least bit surprised. His direction is utterly uninspired, the stalk scenes are boring and redundant, drag on for what seems like an eternity and the pay offs (kills) are for the most part rather dull. Elaborate deaths scenes are the driving force behind this franchise, however almost all the kills seem extra tame after the especially brutal Part 4 (with the exception of the garden shears to the face – nice) and the MPAA hacking it to bits can't have helped much either.The acting is generally what you'd expect, nobody really stands out and there is nothing even approaching a memorable character but the cast manage to keep from embarrassing themselves. As mentioned, John Shepard is a pretty poor lead, probably the worst of the first 5 films.I have to give the filmmakers credit for trying to go in new directions and not just re-hashing the Jason formula and there are moments when it feels like we are going to get to see a truly tortured, complex character in Tommy Jarvis. I get the feeling, especially from the ""shock"" (ie, utterly predictable) ending that the producers were really ready to move the series forward and leave Jason dead and that is worthy of praise. However, the film too often slips back into silly slasher territory and with direction as dull and kill scenes as tame as this, that simply isn't good enough.Obviously the series was never known for its' high art but this is the first one that I consider truly bad. It still made money though and another sequel was soon in production. You just can't keep a good cash-cow down...",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

Suzanne Bateman had one of the prettiest manicures I've even seen on film and in real life. It's too bad she has not had much of a TV or movie career. And most unfortunately I cannot find any photographs of Suzanne Bateman anywhere on the internet. Suzanne Bateman is a very gorgeous girl. I think so, It is based on that part in the movie after Jason was finally destroyed, when she was standing in the hospital room filing her red glossy fingernails.

241,TheRagingBull94,"It's not a great horror film, but it is still throughly entertaining and underrated",7,2 September 2011,"Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning is often labelled the black sheep of the Friday the 13th series and is an installment that most people seem to ignore due to the elitist attitude that simply because our hockey mask wearing hero, Jason Voorhees is not present in this film and in his place is merely just an impostor. However, with an attitude like this, ignoring this film if you're a fan of the earlier films is really just causing you to miss out on a nice piece of horror entertainment. It may not be quite as good as the earlier films and had its fair share of flaws, but it certainly is a great piece of fun worth checking out.A New Beginning opens up with a dream sequence where Tommy Jarvis, the only recurring character in the franchise besides Jason, has a dream where Jason rises from the grave and is about to kill him. After he wakes up we learn that he is being transported to a mental home around Camp Crystal Lake. After one patient murders another over something completely ridiculous, a series of murders begin happening across the area at the hands of a killer who is using Jason's old M.O.Indeed, this is not the greatest horror movie ever made and far from the best Friday the 13th film, but what A New Beginning does that what all the following ones do not is it retains the style of filmmaking that made the previous films so likable. The style is hard to describe, but comparing Friday the 13th Part IV and Part VI you can see the level of change. Part V stylistically remained the most true to its predecessors than any Friday the 13th film that followed it, but sadly it just doesn't do it quite as well as the previous horror classics.One thing I appreciate is the return of the character, Tommy Jarvis. While the actor who portrayed him in this, John Shepherd doesn't hold a candle to Corey Feldman or Thom Mathews from Part VI, I did enjoy his performance mainly due to the shy personality he portrayed. As far as the other characters go, most of them are a bore and you just want to see the fake Jason kill them. Especially the hillbilly characters who were simply just irritating and besides the scene where Tommy kicks the ass of one of them they should have been cut from the film. I also really like the character who appeared to be some wannabe Michael Jackson. His appearance alone made the character worth it. A particular scene I really like in the film is the infamous scene in which Vic kills Joey over the issue of a chocolate bar and chopping wood. It's over the top and ridiculous, but in classic Friday the 13th fashion it is just awesome! Besides this scene, the kills are great and some are even quite imaginative, there's a solid body count and there is plenty of nudity (in fact, the nudity is better than the previous films).Other negatives are rooted in the fact that the film isn't particularly scary at all. Even though I've never found Friday the 13th films scary, the last 4 (especially the first) all had their tense moments. There is none of that here and sometimes it feels as though nothing of importance or interest is going on. I also want to add that the ending is just really bad, but it doesn't ruin the overall experience you had for the last 80 minutes.Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning is not an outstanding horror film and isn't equal to its predecessors, but it is a nice piece of fun that fans can enjoy as long as they can get over the fact that Jason is not the killer and the ending is quite bad. It's a worthwhile horror movie and worth seeing.7/10",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
242,jackbruns29,What could have been.,7,30 December 2020,"Oh what could have been. Ah, Friday the 13th: A New Beginning is the black sheep of the franchise....for some reason. And for some reason, the hatred is because it's not actually Jason Voorhees behind that mask. No. His body has been cremated. He's dead dead. His replacement is a copy cat killer, using the violent lore of Jason to instill fear in his many victims.The story itself is similar to many other Friday the 13th movies. Except this time, it's a camp dedicated to providing comforting services to mentally challenged individuals. Thus, giving an excuse to bring back a much older Tommy Jarvis along with a different actor.I won't get into too many other spoilers, as I've already given away the main one. However, I will point out once again, much like Halloween three, it doesn't deserve the hate it's been given. It has it's problem. Maybe with a better script and better director it could've turned out much better. But I can respect that Paramount tried to go into a different direction. Which is a shame. Look. I love zombie Jason. Part six is probably my favorite of the franchise - the most fun. But wouldn't a copy cat killer Jason been better with Tommy Jarvis as the eternal suspect? Because once you get past part six, the franchise just declined and declined. To the point where Jason was actually hacking people on a futuristic star ship. Maybe it's just me, but I feel had the fans given this one a chance, we might've gotten some more classic Friday the 13th movies without Jason.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

Upon his arrival, one of the residents is axed to death, essentially for being annoying, and then the rest of the cast get picked off...well, you know how it goes.What really sets this movie apart from its predecessors is the introduction of a mystery element. Every killing is done in an Argentoesque manner where we never actually see who's perpetrating the crimes and are left to guess his identity. I enjoyed what they were going for, but ultimately, the reveal was more like Scooby Doo than Deep Red. It's hard to be surprised when the villain is someone you knew nothing about and every sign pointed to someone else.The characters were all surprisingly real, so when they were sent to sleep with the fishes you felt kind of bad for them, especially Demon and Violet. Demon was a Michael Jackson wanna-be who only had about fifteen minutes of screen time but was incredibly memorable. Violet was the definition of 80's pop and, in my opinion, had the best scene in the movie where she did the robot.Fans of the series tend to label this entry as the black sheep.

Some examples:· When the fat kid tells Vic that he is ""Really out of  line!"" and then Vic chops him up with an axe.· When Dudley from ""Diff'rent Strokes"" drives a tractor  into the killer with an expression on his face like he's Rambo.· The way that girl Violet dances.· When that guy with the stutter tries to seduce that red head girl.· The way the mother and son who live down the street seem more deranged than the killer.· The face Demon makes when he's taken a dump.· How that bald guy who was on ""Sesame Street"" is a pervert.· And most importantly how this film tries to be a mystery and yet the identity of the killer so obvious that it would be an insult to the intelligence of Forrest Gump.If you are looking to be intellectually stimulated this is not the film for you. Yet if you have a strong stomach and are in a good mood you might find yourself laughing. This is the type of film Ed Wood would have made.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
251,jeff-8,Feels Like FRIDAY,10,9 January 1999,"Even though this sequel leaves you wondering if the killer is really Jason or Not, It still has all the same feel, fun, and grue as any other Friday The 13th movie!  As a matter of fact, The gore in this chapter is some of the best in the series!  The finale of the movie, which is a chase scene in the rain that ultimately ends in a barn, is full of suspense and atmosphere!  What's funny is that SCREAM gets credit for using the ""Who Is The Killer"" scenario, but FRIDAY THE 13th: A NEW BEGINNING did it first and did a damn good job!! I would recommend this movie to any true FRIDAY THE 13th Fan...whether or not you don't know if Jason is the killer until the end is just another fun reason to enjoy this great flick!!!",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

If Jason was back and doing the killings, I think people would feel differently about this one. No, it doesn't really need to exist and it doesn't have anything new or interesting to say about the human condition, but it's infectiously fun and incredibly stupid.The death scenes are creative (if, sadly, edited to oblivion by the MPAA), there's some suspense here and there, and the characters are a colorful and memorable bunch.

254,Rabensblut,It was not that bad as I expected to be,8,24 July 2006,"I can say that I saw only 1st, 3rd part and Jason vs Freddy before and many people were writing that this part is rubbish. I do not think so. I saw lo of horrors and this one is OK. There is no Jason so OK there was none even in the original film, it was his mother who was the killer in number one (they killed the son, so they had to die, same as here). Now finally there are no camps, and the dead are not only teenagers like in the most of the chillers. The idea with the fat boy slashed was original. That nobody knew the father, so what? If U had a kid like that (fat and mentally retarded) U would maybe do the same as his father did. They told it, that nobody liked the kid and that they had to send him from home to home. When he saw his son in pieces, then probably he became retarded as well. The characters are funny and I liked them more than the simple teens in number one. That is why probably most of the people don't like this part, but I do not care. I am stuffed with teeny chillers without an idea. Here at least they tried to give the idea to the film.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

Jason made the movies famous, so for the creators to use a scooby-doo like ending and an absolutely pathetic storyline that involves a retarded-peoples home shows just how meaningless this movie is. I can recommend every Jason movie except this one and goes to hell, all of the others I found appealing and I own them on DVD. Part 6 is the best though, you just cant go past a movie that Alice Cooper did the soundtrack for!!!!!

256,mikeisitt,"Give it a chance, man!",5,18 December 2010,"Okay, Friday the 13th part 5. You know, I always had these rules with sequels. One of them was that the 5th movie in a series would very often be the least popular. Not the worst, the least popular, the most overlooked. I think I was right with this one.People call this the 'black sheep' of the series. It is very different, I'll admit, but it isn't bad. I found that the 'fun' from the last film, The Final Chapter, is all gone in this film, I mean, this. is. dark. This is very, very dark compared to the 4th film. Isn't that what Friday the 13th is, though? In the sequels they didn't perfect the dark concept, they seemed better being dark and humorous at the same time. I'm just sayin'! The Friday the 13th series should be a little more serious.Anyway, on to the movie. It's got a funky title, I think. A New Beginning, that's pretty cool. It doesn't really make sense, but it's still cool.The guy who plays Tommy looks suspiciously like the guy from Troll 2. The guy that says: ""OH MY GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" Anyway, this guy only says 24 words in the whole movie. Now, hang on. The MAIN CHARACTER SAYS 24 WORDS IN A 90 MINUTE FILM, come on! It's like a breath of fresh air to hear him say anything. This dude doesn't even say anything interesting, he is probably one of the most lame characters ever in a film. He also knows karate for some reason. Weird.The first guy to go is the fat guy. It's really surprising though. You might not see it coming, I won't spoil it.Well, we are then treated to many, many more bloody kills. Apparentley, the makers of this made a contract for everybody on set or something and it said that you couldn't give away the ending to anybody in the public. Wow, these guys were very surprisingly committed to this, the ending wasn't even that good, but it's good to know these guys who made this truly believed in this.The ending is pretty weak, and the very end is just confusing.Overall, Beginning is not as fun as part 4, and it's best seen with a group of mates, I guess.So just give it a try, go in with low expectations and just watch it. It is a bit boring at times, but it's not bad. It's not bad at all.Grade: C+ Rating: 5/10 Sequel Grade: 7/10",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
257,bb74,A downgrade from the previous two films but better than any film after it.,7,31 March 2021,"Although Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning (1985) may have the highest body count of any Friday the 13th film, it lacks the suspense, thrill, violence, creepiness, and scariness of its previous two predecessors. However, that is not to say all is terrible about the fifth installment of the Friday the 13th franchise. It is quite enjoyable, has a more diverse cast from its predecessors, and has likeable and funny characters that give the film kick, charm, fun and enjoyment.One of the main morals of this horror film is how a particular character - a man, in this instance, deals with PTSD after something horrific and traumatic happening to him years prior to him. Although the film may be beloved and disliked by many horror fans, it also brings out mental health awareness and how we all deal with our own demons.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
258,lostanddelirious85,Not as bad as its reputation.,8,17 December 2010,"There are a few ""Friday"" fans out there that can actually enjoy this film for what it is instead of complaining about what it's not.Yes, the plot is a big departure from the previous films, but once you get over it, it's a pretty fun '80s slasher film with plenty of creative kills and some great chase sequences.The acting is surprisingly solid for a series' fifth entry as well. I really never understood the complaints about the acting in these films, as to me it's always been passable and certainly above most of the slasher rip-offs the decade was littered with.This time, the action takes place at a halfway house in the sticks where Tommy Jarvis, survivor of the previous bloodbath, comes to stay after an undetermined amount of time in a mental hospital. But Tommy can't seem to catch a break, as the bodies of the troubled kids soon begin piling up after his arrival. Is it Jason? Tommy? One of the locals who has a grudge against the disturbed kids? I won't spoil that here.This film has the highest body count in the series, with barely enough time to breathe before the next murder is set up. Thankfully, the series retains its creative flair when it comes to dispatching the victims. Some highlights include a head crushed against a tree with a leather strap, a road flare being improperly used, and a death in an outhouse. There's also a nice moment you can only get in '80s horror involving a girl doing the Robot dance in her bedroom to Pseudo Echo's catchy song ""His Eyes."" Terrific.If there's anything that sets this sequel apart from its brothers and sisters, it's the overall tone of the film, which is much darker this time around. This can be good or bad, depending on what you prefer: a fun slasher sequel like part 3, this is not.The final 20 minutes really get the action going as well. Fans of nudity will also rejoice, as this has the most pair of breasts shown in a ""Friday the 13th"" film to date.I found this better than part four, which I realize puts me on a chopping block with other fans. But I call it like I see it.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
259,aaronpynn32-1,Not As Bad as People Say...,8,3 February 2005,"Out of all the sequels to the Friday the 13th series this one tried hardest to be different and yet get closer to what Friday originally was.This continues the story of Tommy Jarvis a survivor of the last film. Not to kill Tommy off in the first few minutes but actually let Tommy become an important part of the series. There is a murder at the start of the film that sets up the whole movie. it's done pretty ,much off screen but it is the most brutal and heart-wrenching murder that a film of this type will ever get. Tommy is still very scarred seeing visions of the dead jason in his mind and having psychotic attacks it seems that Tommy may have crossed over and started up on Jason's murderous rampage. The ending is put together well and there are a couple good surprises. Its a shame they never followed up on this one with part 6. Instead they took the easy way out. I don't want to give away the films ending enough people come on doing that. As a slasher film that is 5th in the series Friday injects new blood and does a decent job. It has all the pre-requiste nudity and violence and -ohmigod-an attempt at actually writing a coherent script.I should know I write these type of films for a living.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
260,partybabe1998,"A flawed, yet fun flick",8,11 August 2014,"Friday the 13th part 5: A New Beginning is still worth at least one or two watches. The plot revolves around Tommy Jarvis, the boy from part 4; he is 18 now and still haunted and traumatized by the memories of Jason and the loss of his mother at the age of 12. Tommy is currently residing in Pinehurst halfway house for troubled teens. Not long after his arrival, a dumb, yet sweet boy named Joey is killed by a rather angry man named Vick(why anyone in there right mind would let a guy like him have an axe, I'll never know.) Joey's death seems to kick off a murder spree, by a killer who is the long lost father of Joey, Roy Burns. Okay, so his motive makes no sense, but there's still some stuff to love about Friday part 5. For one, it has some pretty interesting characters; they're not too well developed, but you do feel sorry for some of them when they die. Final girl Pam and her little friend Reggie are cool and their face-off with the killer is pretty tense. There are also some cool kills in this film, from the guy who gets killed on his bike to Miguel A Nunez Jr's impalement. I'd say give this one at least one watch.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

We again join Tommy Jarvis who has not adjust to life post-Jason at all he has become more less mute and living in a bizarrely normal halfway house. As the kids start dropping like flies it becomes apparent that Jason might be wrongfully accused this time around, however this is more an underlying story point than the dominating theme as this a fairly standard Friday the 13.Very run of the mill slasher movie that tries to make changes almost on the fly as little consideration is given to explain these points. I think special mention should be made of the brutality of this film by far the most violent of all the Friday the 13 with some almost takashi Mike style violence in places. Most of the actors earn their B-movie badge for this one special mention to some of the bit parts of the mother and son rednecks and the broken down greasers who provide laughs in their limited roles.Friday the 13th part 5 a new beginning is a very serious and violent slasher movie that attempts to break the mold but end's up only half filling the cup.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
262,QuickStopVA,Bad...really bad.,3,13 October 2005,"This review spoils one death scene, but I do not give away the ending at all.3 out of 10 points. 1 point for giving us a bridge between part 4 (the second best of the series) and part 6, and 2 points for hanging on to the classic utilization of random nudity.Friday the 13th part 5 - truly the worst of the series (Jason X would take this honor if not for the really good intro). The unbearable acting (especially with the redneck family and poor Joey), the cliché and overdone death scenes, all the unnecessary characters, and the lack of Camp Crystal Lake combine to make this the ultimate Friday the 13th travesty.Camp Crystal Lake is replaced with a mental hospital deep in the woods, and we are forced to watch really boring and unimaginative death scenes (except for one involving a redneck and a motorcycle).For the sake of the series, see this movie, regardless of how terrible it is, but only see it after you've seen part 4.In a nutshell, it's bad, but you gotta see it anyway, if for no other reason than to know what happened between 4 and 6.

263,nothingbuttchicks,"A great psychological thriller, add Jason",8,9 June 2013,"I can understand all the negative reviews for this film, considering the ""real"" Jason does none of the killings, more on that later. However, that being said, I feel that it's one of the best in the series (2nd best in fact next to part III). It's a revenge/love/psychological movie. Set some time after the events of The Final Chapter, young Tommy Jarvis isn't young anymore, but very confused and mentally unstable. He ends up in a halfway house with people hornier than the kids from the last episodes. Tommy meets Reggie the Reckless, who is half Micheal Jackson and half Eddie Murphy. Reggie is a very bad ass little kid who learns that being afraid is only half the battle. Tommy Jarvis, who throws more punches than words, deals with his own demons while a Jason impostor starts to kill off the unsuspecting patrons of the halfway house. The real Jason appears only three times throughout this slaughter-fest. Once in the opening dream sequence, another seen in the mirror by Tommy, and the last while Tommy looks out the window. I personally think that the last was not just a vision, but the real Jason sending a warning to Tommy Jarvis. The redneck neighbor scenes are rather humorous because they portray the stereotypical idiotic family that lives way out in the sticks. Rednecks will be rednecks. But the main reason for me liking this film is because it's based more around Tommy Jarvis than Jason. It's more of a thriller than a slasher film. Don't get me wrong, it has it's fair share of blood and gore, but it deals more with mind, instead of the ""Jason Factor."" Plus it's great because the Violet Character does a great version of, ""The Robot."" However, I can understand the bad reviews because of the main storyline. People don't like when you mess with a good story/character. I also understand that the writers planned on Tommy being the so called next Jason. In a way I'm very glad they didn't go with that route, but seriously...could you imagine if they had?

It has got a chilling atmosphere and I LOVE JULIETTE CUMMINS (the redheaded patient) I do not understand why so many of our fellow Friday fans, hate this sequel just because Jason is absent, as if it wasn't getting boring, the same indestructable killing machine movie after movie, he started to look to much like a Freddy Kreuger.

The Tommy character seems to fit someone who's in their teens, at oldest late teens. The guy looks like someone in his late 20s trying to act and look like a scared kid around 16 going to a halfway house. Turns out the actor was a partially balding 24 yr old. Just terrible, not to mention his awful acting.First scene, Jason is buried like what, 1 foot below the ground? I mean there was a lid on some sort of casket, but what the heck? 1 foot down? Too lazy to dig a proper grave lol? Then the best they can do for grave crawlers is a bucket of dew worms dumped on Jason? Just awful. I can't believe the budget was 2.2 million. Just unreal bad.Then at the halfway house the slow kid Joey looks like an already balding middle-aged man trying to be a much younger character from anywhere in their teens to early twenties at oldest. Such bad casting.Then Joey goes over to the angry halfway house person, again appearing to well into his 30s, but is a violent offender who is cutting a chunk of log sideways with an axe - did anyone in this movie not know how splitting a 2 foot log is done with an axe? Yet another face-palm moment. And then, of course, this is supposed to be a halfway house without guards and yet here's clearly a violent offender wielding an axe who then axes Joey to death. Just such awful writing and acting.Then middle-aged dude with coke in his car picking up a waitress who checks out her upper body in the mirror before getting knifed. Both actors 10-20 years older than the characters they're playing.And back to the halfway house where every single actress looks like an old-than-her-character-by-a-decade crack-addict, and the dudes who are left also a decade older and less employable (as an actor) than they should.Beyond all the awful casting, writing, blown budget, predictability . . . Such a lame ending. But I guess it was some sort of a twist.Finally, I still can't believe how terrible the casting was.

Some people say bad acting, but the acting was bad in ALL the Jason movies so one should not complain about that. The only other problem I can see people having with this film is that it tried to have a serious plot which for many people is the wrong thing to do in a horror sequel, particularly a 5th sequel. The plot was basically trying to explore Tommy Jarvis's psyche after having to chop up Jason's head with a machete. I could have been a good Jason movie but this plot was not executed properly not to mention the fact that by the time there's a 5th sequel to a horror movie nobody gives a crap about the why and how of what's taking place they just want to see people get killed.

For those of you who have already seen it, there are a few things I'd like to understand about Friday The 13th Pt. 5:1) Why do none of the girls in the entire movie wear bras? Was this a big trend back in '85 that I missed?2) Why wasn't Madonna credited for her role? :)3) Was Madonna really a robot of some sort?? I got a little confused after seeing her dance before she got hacked.4) Was chili served on the set every day, because everyone in the movie decided to take a dump at some point.Friday 5 is somewhat different than the rest...not just because it didn't really have Jason (well, sorta), but because it didn't really make any sense, even by Friday the 13th standards...Overall, still a great late-night feature and definitely not as bad as others claim.

276,madmedic81,A half-Jason in a halfway house in a half-a$$ attempt at movie-making,3,11 February 2009,"Oh, where the HELL do we begin with this one? Let's just begin by saying that for almost everything good we find in the preceding ""Chapter"" and most of the subsequent and prior efforts, this all-out stinker manages to pretty much take a giant dump on the series.We find ourselves with a pretty strong (if somewhat confusing)opening....young Tommy Jarvis (in a cameo appearance I'm sure an adult Cory Feldman regrets) is going in the middle of the night (WHY??? And in thunderstorm, no less) to visit the grave of the Masked One, himself, Jason Voorhees. The same guy who killed his mother. The guy he dispatched in gruesome awesomeness in Part 4. Then, his visit is interrupted by a couple of truly stupid thrill seekers who want nothing more than to see a rotting corpse at night in a thunderstorm. As Tommy watches in horror at a (seemingly) safe distance, the vandals dig up Jason, they get killed by Jason (naturally), and Tommy is then killed, himself, by Jason.....the whole scene, in spite of its implausibility (it's OK...this IS a Friday flick) is actually pretty darn scary.And that's more or less where the thrills end.Tommy wakes up, no longer as a preteen Cory Feldman, but as a teenage mental patient.....he dreamed the whole thing. He's totally f#@*ed up from the events of Part 4, and he's headed to a halfway house for rehabilitation.....a halfway house in the middle of the woods at Crystal Lake.....RIGHT.......He arrives to the usual array of clichéd characters (for some strange reason, they are pretty much the same characters rehashed from the previous 4 films, only now being a pot-smoking, sex obsessed teen is a reason for mental institutionalisation). We meet Pam (the sexy assistant), Matt (the kind doctor in casual attire), Reggie (a slightly taller and no-less annoying version of Gary Coleman), Reggie's Gramps (Fred Sandford with positive moral values), and all the so-called nuts....including the hillbilly neighbors (who SHOULD be the ones in the halfway house, themselves).And what kind of Friday the 13th would it be if people didn't start getting hacked to pieces? Yep, it begins, only Jason doesn't start the mayhem.....a really pi$$ed off dude named Vic chops up the obligatory fat guy (COMMON SENSE ALERT....never give the guy with anger issues an AXE....).I'll just go ahead and ruin it right here, because from the moment the paramedics arrive to pick up the dead fat kid, it's OH-SO obvious who the killer is.....it's one of the paramedics (whose son just so happens to be the dead fat kid....well, pieces of the dead fat kid, anyhow).From this point on, an unseen killer begins slaughtering anyone and everyone in sight....is it Tommy? Is it the creepy guy shoveling crap from the Hillbillies' chicken coupe? Is it Colonel Mustard using the candle stick in the kitchen? Nope....although any one of those scenarios (particularly the first of them) would have been more interesting.....but one thing is for sure, it AIN'T Jason, people. Never mind the fact that we already pretty much figured from the get-go that the paramedic is the killer. Gee, what DO they teach in EMT courses, these days? It pretty much gets worse as the movie drags on....if you were expecting lots of gore, forget it....the MPAA hit this one (as well as the next three) HARD, and what we are left with is a lot of off-screen kills, a mannequin with a road flare in it's mouth, a painful-but-implausible death-by-leather strap, and a survivor (?) chick who likes to crawl around in the mud. We actually get the first beheading since the original Friday, and not even that one is very fun to watch. And, after waiting the ENTIRE movie, we finally see Jason (or Pseudo-Jason, anyhow) for about ten minutes after all the victims are dead. The pits.There are a FEW redeeming qualities....John Shepherd does a MARVELOUS job as the tortured Tommy. Harry Manfredini does his usual greatness with the music score. There are breasts....several of 'em....and probably the biggest pair in the series' history. We get to laugh out loud when Reggie takes off and leaves Pam in the dust during the chase scene. None of these perks helps to detract from the massive amount of shortcomings that plague the rest of the film.And unfortunately, we get the worst script (and that's saying a LOT) in the entire saga. Although none of the Friday the 13th films ever lost money at the box office, this was the first to be a disappointment to Paramount execs. Why? Well, let's see.....very little blood, NO JASON, more stupid characters than you could shake a stick at, NO JASON, an incredible boredom factor....and did I mention there's NO JASON????? This one actually spoke for your typical Friday the 13th fan.......we may not require a lot out of our plot, but at LEAST don't try to insult us by sticking Roy the Psychotic Paramedic in Mr. Voorhees's shoes and try to make us believe he IS Jason.And that's ANOTHER major gripe I have with Part 5.....the ""parental revenge"" scenario worked great for Betsy Palmer.....but it ROYALLY sucked when it was duplicated in this instance....give us a better reason for someone to just go off and snap like that.....maybe someone stole his ambulance and it pi$$ed him off.....maybe he's an unreformed former patient at the halfway house....maybe he just doesn't like the way his waitress cooked the eggs....hell, I don't know, but DON'T give us the same old ""my-son-is-dead-and-you-let-him-die"" bit.Friday the 13th (Part 5)-A New Beginning is without a doubt the worst of the series. Easily skippable.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
277,deanmartin101,A GREAT FRIDAY THE 13TH MOVIE,10,28 September 2002,"Alright, people, just shut up about this movie not starring Jason. Personally, I loved this movie, Jason or no Jason. The scene of where Tommy is having his dream and seeing those two teens killed by a reviving Jason is awesome, regardless of what ANYONE says. The killer storyline was mondo cool, with the killer seeking revenge for his murdered son. Dick Wieand did a great, no, EXCELLENT job portraying 'Jason' in this flick. There's much more I could say, but then I would be here all night. So in short, all you just shut up, watch a scary movie, and have a happy Friday the 13th!",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
278,kevinchengxin,Missed opportunity? Perhaps,4,31 January 2015,"The 5th entry in this longevous slasher series was released one year after the 4th one, which was most inappropriately titled The Last Chapter. This is the movie that was supposed to link the old series centered on Jason (including the first one about his mother) to a new series of sequels surrounding Tommy, the child victim turned psychopath. So the task was simple and clear, to pay homage to the old and tell an origin story for the new, what could go wrong? By 2015, 6 more Friday movies were released, including a reboot, plus a crossover with the Nightmare franchise, all of which are about the original Jason. So the inevitable solution is, A New Beginning failed.Had they gone as they planned and installed Tommy as the new villain, this movie might not be put in such an awkward place in the series, being the only one that doesn't feature the real Jason or his mother. Similar to Season of the Witch, the 3rd film in the Halloween series, which is the only one not concerning Michael Myers. That film is known for being better than reputed, because fans are too mad about its irrelevancy to notice any actual good about the project. So could this be the same case with A New Beginning? Is it also misunderstood, just because it's different?IT IS NOT!As explained above, the core plot line of this film is predestined, which means all they had to do was add some typical slasher-standard characters, and invent new ways for them to die. And they couldn't even do that right!! At least 70% of this movie is filler, completely pointless scenes that refuses to end, characters acting as stupidly as possible, annoying your butt off while doing so, until you actually cheer for the murderer when he kills them off, restoring what little tranquility that's left in you when watching this disappointment. It's boring, it's stupid, and it's plainly a bad film.But in every case of failure, there are redeemable elements. The big mystery of this film is the identity of the killer. You do have to guess all the way (if you manage to actually care, that is). Is it Jason who came back to life? Is it Tommy who finally lost his mind? Is it the lunatic that hacked another kid in the beginning? I do admit that the final answer is something probably nobody saw coming. But simply because it's stupid as hell. But everyone to their own opinion, somebody might think it's brilliant and they're entitled to it. Considering the overall criticisms this film received, I doubt there're many defenders.So except that little ounce of mystery, nothing in this film works at all. There is no scare, no blood gushing, no exceptionally entertaining ways of murder, no believable or likable characters. Even the sound design is kinda crappy. Not helped by the complete idiocy of all characters. There are a million chances for these victims to finish the killer off, but they never even try it. When it comes to Friday movies, expectations aren't raised very high, but A New Beginning still manages fall below.Had this movie worked as planned, what would have happened for this beloved series? We can't know for sure. It's hard to imagine anyone replacing the machete-wielding disfigured under hockey-mask. Perhaps we should be secretly glad that this Tommy thing didn't work out, or we wouldn't have Freddy vs. Jason.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

280,jeremynicholsv1,Friday the 13th: A New Beginning (1985),7,3 April 2015,"Friday the 13th: A New Beginning is considered the black sheep of the series (much like Halloween 3 and A Nightmare on Elm Street 2). However not everything about A New Beginning is bad, it just takes some understanding to accept and appreciate the film.We start off meeting Tommy Jarvis, who we first met in the previous film as a kid played by Corey Feldman. Now Tommy is a teenager and headed to a halfway house out in the country. His mom and sister are dead (even though his sister survived the last film). Upon reaching the halfway house we meet the other troubled kids there. Joey is the fat one, who's not only got an eating disorder but is slightly mentally challenged. Victor is the loose cannon who can't control his temper, Violet just seems to like punk music (there's no reason given why she's here). There's a few others, but it's hard to tell why they're at the house and it's never explained. Whatever.Not long after Tommy shows up, Victor hacks Joey to pieces with an ax (because why not give weapons to teenagers with issues) and is taken away by the cops. Tommy keeps hallucinating that Jason is there, seeing him in his room and outside. More of the teens wind up dead, dropping like flies every few minutes. The local Sheriff suspects it's Jason Voorhees, but that's refuted by the mayor who claims Jason was cremated (which would cause some confusion for the next film).More and more bodies pile up until we're down to Tommy, Reggie (a young boy who was at the house to visit his grandfather) and Pam who helps run the facility. The three of them face off with ""Jason"", taking their hits before dropping him onto a piece of farm equipment that is basically a bed of spikes. It's at this point we find out that ""Jason"" was Roy, an ambulance driver seen earlier in the film and also Joey's dad. The film ends on a cliffhanger, with Tommy wearing the hockey mask and ready to kill Pam.So let's tackle the biggest complaint people have with the film: that Jason is not the killer. Okay, I get it, after three films you wanted Jason to be doing the killing. Let me stop you right there though, the first Friday the 13th film didn't have Jason doing the killing. Jason's mom, Mrs. Voorhees was doing all of the killing, because the camp counselors let Jason drown. Here, Roy loses his mind and starts killing because the people at the house let Joey get hacked to pieces. If anything, Friday the 13th A New Beginning is a remake of Friday the 13th. So yeahput that in your hater pipe and smoke it.The kills come swiftly here, every ten minutes or so there's a death. This was a mandate handed down by the producers. This in turn meant that they needed more cannon fodder, so more characters were added. Too many if you ask me. This film has the highest body count in the series and it shows. Random extra characters are introduced and promptly killed off, like the greasers who have about seven minutes of screen time and then die, and they appear nowhere else in the film. The orderly and his date, also share about the same amount of time on-screen before eating it. I get they wanted to up the gore and have more bodies, but it really slows down the film and adds very little.Danny Steinmann does a decent job as director considering he'd done little directing before this. Of course the characters are for the most part under developed, while Tommy, the lead of the film, fails to the same fate. I wish they had put more time into Tommy's character, give us a reason to either suspect him as the killer or root for him to get over his problems and put an end to this killing spree. Neither is done, as you never suspect him nor are you relieved when he finally shows up at the end.The setting is a bit off, as it's a halfway house in the country with no rules. That seems to be an odd way of helping those that have problems. Again, it's hard to tell why half of these kids are here, some are obvious, like Victor and Joey. I liked seeing Violet doing the robot before she gets killed, only because people forget how cool the robot was.Overall people have hated on A New Beginning for twenty plus years. Real fans of the series however realize the film is more of the same from the franchise, and enjoy it like any other film. I get the argument that it's not really Jason doing the killing, but he didn't do the killing in the first film either and it was just as good. A New Beginning isn't great, and I wouldn't put it in my top ten horror movies, but it's still a solid offering and better than some of the later Friday the 13th films.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
281,DennisSmithersJr,(Underrated) One of the Best in the Series,9,3 October 2020,"I suppose I'm the ""odd-man-out,"" but I believe ""A New Beginning"" is one of the best films in the series. I love almost everything about it---the unique approach, the killer's mask, the actors who played the killer---even the way the 35mm print looks!I believe Johnny Hock and Tom Morga (who both played the killer behind the mask) were perfectly cast! As a matter of fact, Johnny Hock--who played Jason Voorhees in the opening dream sequence, and Morga who played ""pseudo"" Jason in the rest of the picture, minus a couple of scenes done by Hock--had the perfect charisma and stature. I would have been completely happy if Hock and Morga would have played Jason in ALL of the films---not to take away from a couple of the rest of the fellows, of course; Ted White and C.J. Graham nailed it as well in parts 4 and 6, respectively.I even loved both unique masks (the dream sequence ""real"" Jason's AND Morga's ""pseudo"" Jason's).All-in-all, ""A New Beginning"" deserves its turn in the spotlight; it shouldn't be shunned just because it had a different approach--I thought it to be a very interesting take that, honestly, I'd like to see again---who IS it behind the mask?",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
282,twitchy_fit,The Point From Where The Series Sloped Down Hill,4,5 April 2007,"PLOT: 4-7 years after Part 4, Tommy Jarvis is then taken from the mental hospital, to a ""Half-way House"". A place fro troubled teens, trying to make their way back into society. But as Tommy arrives, a series of gruesome murderers start to take place... Could it be Jason Voorhees, returning from the dead to have his revenge?My rating out of 10: ***Fraiday the 13th was great. Part 2 was okay. I prefer Part 3 over Part 2. Part 4 would have been a good ending for the series, had they stuck by the title name.Parts 5, 6,7,8, Jason Goes To Hell, and Jason X were all a joke. Why? Because they killed off Jason in Part 4.... Where it all SHOULD have ended.I do respect them NOT bringing Jason back to life, rather it just being a different killer, but Part 6 eventually killed the series by resurrecting Jason from the dead. And then there was Part 7, with the telekinetic girl!! And don't even get me started on Jason Takes Manhatten... Or Jason Goes To Hell! I MEAN WHAT THE F***ING HELL WAS THAT? Sorry, I'm just angry that I bought it for $12.95. Anyway, when you compare this to movies like HALLOWEEN 5, or even Silent Night, Deadly Night Part II, you can see that it's really boring, plot-holed, and all in all, just terrible!

It just sits there on its own, a dull, confusing mess. Skip it, you're not missing anything. Jason doesn't even appear.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
285,mcfly017,The slasher movie so bad that you can't help from yelling at the screen,1,21 February 2000,"In the most obscure and inscrutable way, I can claim to have somewhat enjoyed watching this movie, even though I drifted in and out of slumber during the first half hour (less a reflection on the movie than on my late Friday night fatigue).  I mean, I won't kid anyone: it's a mess, a sloppy, careless exercise in patronizing redundancy.  Without offering any additional insight into elusive, mute butcher Jason Voorhies, the movie follows him from one of his ""why did he kill THIS person"" machete murders to the next, to the next, to the next, then - whoa! big J gets creative and digs an open pair of garden shears into someone's chest!  Then another machete to the throat/abdomen, another, another, then ka-blammo! Jason loses his machete in favor of a road flare that he forces into the mouth of some random stranger.  And what to our wondrous eyes did - oh wait, he's made amends with the accessibly bloodless machete, and into more bodies it goes. The routine sucks all the more because almost every single one of the 20 or so slashings requires at least five endless minutes of setup time that is absolutely, torturously meaningless.  It's understandable if a brutal murder is preceded by a minute or two of tension-heightening trepidation, goosed up with an eerie background violin or repetition of a single piano key.  But when two people I may or may not have seen earlier in the movie get their groove on in the woods, then one of them takes a brief leave of absence (to go skim rocks on the nearby lake?!), and the considerately naked girl lies there on the blanket resting, I suspect that the entire film crew decided to take 5 but leave the camera on.  She lays there for over a minute!  That's nothing compared to the age of the universe, I concede, but in cinema time, it can be a lifetime - especially when there's no music, no dialogue, no motion whatsoever - she just lays there, and the camera makes some POV changes, never forgetting to include her hooters in the shot, until finally Hockey Mask Man appears over her and dispatches her in a way we aren't even allowed to watch!  Instead, we just the see a very brief flash of the result when the boyfriend comes back and finds her with her eyes gorged out. Honestly, all the reviews I read for Jason V touch on the film's ""gruesome, gratuitous violence,"" but it's tame waters from my perspective.  We usually don't see the murder take place, it instead being implied by a close-up of the victim's shocked expression and the sound of someone from the music department pile-driving the left side of the piano.  And there's some splotches of blood on a corpse here, a tidy pool of it there, but more often Jason fails to extract ANY blood when he slices up everyone, almost as if he was puncturing stuffed dummies and severing MANNEQUIN heads (hmmm.). Other screw-ups: like all mass murder villains, Jason is present in every scene, regardless of time or location - the worst example: he's in walking pursuit (they always walk, to make it scarier since it tells us how deliberate and confident he is) of two characters, but they manage to lose him after running a mile or two through the forest...yet he still ends up reappearing IN FRONT of them).  One false scare, the kind where a cat jumps into view to shatter the unsuspecting silence, is kinda funny, because it looks like the cat was actually thrown at the person.  Technically, there is no acting in the movie at all.  Characters are empty, uninteresting and/or obnoxious (except for the little black kid and his older brother), and Jason himself continues to have none of the idiosyncrasies that most other slasher antagonists at least get as a means of distinction.  Visually and in terms of purpose, a hockey player's goalie mask = nothing.  Jason is just a boy who drowned then mysteriously revived himself as an older person (apparently, in lieu of decomposition, he continued to age and physically grow at the bottom of Camp Crystal Lake), put on a generic jacket and dark jeans, found a way to constantly supply himself with sharp weapons, and embarked on a mission to murder the young and/or authoritarian for the sake of...well, in nine films we never find out (though there is occasional speculation throughout the series).  That's it.  None of the psychological evil of Michael Myers, no vengeance motive in the spirit of Freddy, not even a gimmick like Chucky.  At least in part 8, after Jason fails to ""Take Manhattan,"" we are at last treated to the nasty optical goodies of his hamburger meat face. Thankfully, towards the end the movie gets lazy and stops with the long setups.  The survivors just start encountering bodies of those whose death we didn't see, just to hastily adhere to the rule that only a couple people will be around to watch Jason die.  He does, by the way, but in the unmemorable way of falling onto a conveniently placed slab of spikes (conveniently existent, for that matter - what use is a 4x4 rectangle of steel with spikes on it to anyone in the isolated rural setting of this movie?).  Even more inane is the revelation that it wasn't even Jason this time, just an impostor (though this is at least indicative of variation). Yes, an impostor, who, to conceal his identity, goes so far as to wear a skull cap to show that he's bald like Jason really, inexplicably is. The ""enjoyable"" part of this movie that I hinted at before was the process of writing this review, actually, because it heartily amused me to ruminate on all of Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning's obtrusive foibles.

Hardly anyone was properly developed, not even Tommy Jarvis, the lead hero who only spoke twenty one words during the entire film. BUT it has everything an F13 should have.

Every single movie past 4 is not a part of the series. One positive thing I have to say about this film is that this is a cinematic omen to the remainder of the series in that Jason has nothing to do with it. Part 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 really have nothing to do with Friday the 13th, Crystal lake or Jason and just borrow Jason's story to continue beating a dead horse.Overall unlike the first four films there is no one central character you like or prefer to make it to the end. They writers (who cant' write their way out of a paper bag) were trying to make it a mystery and trying to fool the audience. Is it Jason? Tommy? The Farm hand? Well I guarantee one thing, you won't care. You just want them all dead.The original 4 films had a very specific feel to them, this film and the remainder of the series have somehow completely lost.

However, the viewers didn't actually find out Jason's identity until the very end.

295,fox7x,The Fifth Outing Isn't That Bad...,6,20 May 2006,"... but then again, it does have some problems...First, let's discuss the good. The character of Tommy Jarvis is featured here once again, carrying over from part four. The supporting cast gets a shot in the arm by the likes of Vernon Washington (best known from ""The Last Starfighter""), Richard Young (the guy who gives Indy his hat in ""The Last Crusade"") and Cory Feldman in a cameo role (he was filming ""The Goonies"" at that time and couldn't commit to the project... darn it...). The story itself strives for originality and gives us some genuinely unique characters and a few reprehensible ones to boot.There were inventive death scenes, and the concept of the halfway house took things away from Crystal Lake enough to make it interesting. The little boy Reggie (played by Shavar Ross) was actually one of the few not-annoying kid actors in a horror movie. The casting of John Shepard as Tommy wasn't altogether bad, but he reminded me more of a youthful poor-man's James Spader decked with a quasi-mullet. He had the right intensity to play the part, but I would have rather seen Cory Feldman back for more than just five minutes.And, the obligatory sex scene featured a lovely young lady who was just this side of being a busty Shawnee Smith. Hubba hubba.All that being said, this movie gave us the hick inbred mother-son duo that harass our heroes. Odious and unappealing, they border on being more an annoyance to be offed than comic relief (though they did have some funny moments...). Did we really need them in this movie?Speaking of which, is it possible that maybe Tommy's sister could have come back for this film, instead of the funky hillbillies? I mean, a body count in this kind of movie is important, but the story matters too. And of course, there is a scene with a guy taking a crap in an outhouse (much like a scene in the third film). You know, there has got to be a more dignified way of being whacked in a horror film than in the middle of a steamy burrito-induced bowel movement.And while the idea of a copycat killer in the Jason role is interesting, I think it ultimately took away from the film. It's Friday the 13th. Give us Jason Voorhees or don't bother. The story between Jason and Tommy should have been the focal point (as the film makers realized in the next installment). It would have been so much more relevant.As it stands, this fifth installment isn't bad. It's a fairly well done slasher flick with its share of bad acting and goofy moments.

300,scott_beowulf,One Of The Best Slashers Ever,10,20 August 2006,"The status of Friday The 13th Part V: A New Beginning as the least popular film in the series has always frustrated and perplexed me. Masterfully directed by Danny Steinmann, it is a supremely entertaining exploitation slasher film. The most common reasons given seem to be: (a) there's not enough gore (b) the story is stupid/the acting isn't very good (c) Jason isn't in the movie. Of course, none of these explanations is valid. First of all, if gore alone is your litmus test to determine whether or not a film is enjoyable, you should probably steer clear of the entire Friday The 13th series, as well as any movie that has been subjected to the wacky ratings system and experienced a wide theatrical release. Go watch I don't know a Guinea Pig film. A New Beginning has as much gore as any of the Friday films. If a strong plot and acting of the highest caliber is important to you well, let's be honest, criticizing A New Beginning for its silly plot is like dismissing Van Gogh because you don't like the color yellow. You're missing the point. Yes, I sort of understand the complaint that Jason isn't in the movie, as he is my favorite of the classic maniacs. (Cropsy, Marty, Michael Meyers, and Angela round out the top five.) But his absence alone shouldn't ruin the whole movie for you. I'd rather watch an entertaining movie that alludes to, yet doesn't feature the actual Jason, as opposed to a boring movie that completely screws up his mythology. (Here's a clue. It comes after VIII and before X.)Friday The 13th Part V: A New Beginning works because it takes the elements that make a good slasher film and completely exaggerates them. All irony aside, A New Beginning is a trashy, sleazy, exploitative masterpiece. The very premise of having ""Jason"" hack up a group of mentally-ill teens, which includes two nymphomaniacs, an angry sociopath, a chocolate loving man child, a new-wave goth who likes to dance, and a stutterer, is indicative of the sick-minded, oozy greatness of this movie. Jesus, I haven't even touched upon the mother-son hillbilly biker duo or Demon! This movie has more great characters than the entire Halloween series combined! Are you not entertained by Demon in his ""sh*tbox"" singing ""Oooh, Oooh, Baby. Oooh, Oooh, Baby"" to his sexy girlfriend before being impaled? How could this be? Are you made of stone? Are you? Do you not enjoy watching Violet, who is the most uniquely attractive female in the entire Friday series, do the robot to Pseudo Echo before being killed? I love her with all my heart. What about Ethel and Junior, the most vile, hate-filled, ""loony"" hating hicks to ever interact with a stained voyeur-drifter? Junior's decapitation, after being pummeled by Tommy following a prank which consisted of shining a light in his eyes, is a fitting end for the angry dullard. Oh, and Vic? The greatest red herring in slasher history. He violently kills Joey after the overweight stereotype accuses him of being ""out of line."" Harsh words from a strange man! The number of kills in this movie dwarf the previous Friday record. (Subsequent sequels had more, but, with the exception of Jason X another unjustly maligned classic not by much.) The fact that most of these kills are peripheral to the story, unnecessary, and hilarious only adds to their quality. Case in point, the hideously obnoxious, cocaine-addicted mental health worker Billy who picks up Lana the waitress at the diner. She who proceeds to get naked while saying ""It's showtime!"" to herself in the mirror. You don't see the entertainment value in that, my friends? Following this odd display, a cat bafflingly drops from above and bounces clumsily and hard off a booth. It was a cheap shock and laugh at the same time! Shortly thereafter, Billy and Lana are both killed with enough blood to make it all worthwhile. That entire scene is mesmerizing. And let's not forget the two jerks with the broken down car who appear earlier in the film. They're greasers! Greasers! I watch slasher films not for genuine scares or insightful twists, but to be entertained. And I am usually entertained by their exploitative depths, bloody action, nudity, uniquely stupid characters, and the basest nihilism of it all. I simply cannot see how anyone could argue A New Beginning doesn't contain every single one of these qualities in excess. It's a sleazy, vicious, offensive slasher that epitomizes everything that makes the genre popular. The time has come to re-evaluate this amazing film and give Steinmann the credit he deserves.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
301,laurenblee,Good slasher that does follow same plot as original,8,30 April 2021,A lot of people say it strays from the original source material... I beg to differ. You have a distraught parent that murders the folks that didn't save their kid.. gee doesn't that sound like the very first Friday the 13th? Even though the one that dies first isn't Jason Voorhees..it still sets up the plot I will say though.. I didn't like how they basically made Tommy into the next killer. Makes no sense for his character whatsoever. Just a cheap twist. But either way I let that slide.,Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
302,Metal Mama,Damn good,9,19 August 2001,"Personally,I think this one is just as good,if not better,than the ones before it. It kept me in suspense all the way through unlike the two before it.Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Jason fan and love to see him slash up those stupid teens,but this one had me just a tad more into it and guessing who the killer really is,as it is not so obvious. Also,you can clearly see how far the series had come as it is the best looking installment yet.Overall, this movie is damn good in every way. The killings are great and,in some instances,funny as well ( the guy on the toilet ). Actually,this movie has black humour all over it, which is an added bonus as well. The ending gave me an unexpected chill,I'll admit, but did leave me a bit confused too. Still, worth watching a few times for sure.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
303,DiegoTF,Why is everyone so hard on this film?,8,30 October 2001,"Why is everyone so hard on this film. Lets look at it a different way. It dared to be different. God forbid a new idea should be presented. I mean when the Final Chapter was over, Mr. Voorhees was dead. So how does Hollywood re-invent the series? To bring Jason back so quickly would be insulting to our intelligence, the hockey masked killer is the backbone of the series, wait, I got it! Let's make the audience wonder just how Jason came back, but at the end, it will be a real twist to see that it wasn't Jason at all. We still got 90 minutes of hockey masked killings, one of the highest body counts of the entire series, some of the most innovative deaths in the series, and a continuation of the story line with Tommy Jarvis. The film was shot well, the atmospherics were well done, the acting was on par for a lower budget horror sequel, and everyone involved in the film cared, and that projected forth from their performances. I think the reason everyone comes down so hard on this film is that it had the fortituide to be different. Do you?",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
304,Gamer8585,Not as bad as people make it sound!,7,1 September 2002,"Let me start off by saying that I have seen all of the Friday the 13th films so I rate these films in context (that means not comparing them to films like Star Wars or Gone with the Wind). I think that out of all of the Friday the 13th Films this is one of the best and here is why: It's originality hasn't been seen in the series since part 1, Tommy's troubled psychology is rampant throughout the film, it has a huge body count, and the end has about 3 good twists. Most people don't like the film because *SPOILER* Jason isn't the killer it's an imposter using Jason's MO (actually Pamela Voorhees' MO since Jason was copying his mother, but I digress) I like this film because Jason didn't return, I liked Jason as a killer but c'mon his coming back just started to annoy me worse then the worst acting in the series (I really didn't like the fact they brought him back as a psycho Zombie in part VI which was a good movie otherwise). *END SPOILER* As for faults its the same bad acting as most F13 films (except for Tommy [played by John Shepherd] who was very good), it doesn't go far enough with Tommy's troubled state until after the killer is dead (they could have made Tommy seem like the killer which they only lightly hinted at), and the killer is too easily figured out by the way he acts when he is at his day job.I give it 7/10",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
305,DrLoomis13,horrible!,1,2 August 2003,"i'm a horror movie fan and enjoy some of the f13 movies. the series as a whole is derivative and has no really great films, but parts 1, 4, and 6 are passable as fun horror flicks. part 5, however, is TERRIBLE. it's bad even by f13 standards and is in general one of the worst ""films"" i've ever seen, regardless of genre. avoid this movie at all costs, unless you want to laugh at just how bad a movie can be.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
306,skateor,ONE OF THE BEST!,10,10 July 2003,"This is probably the most original of the series.It keeps you guessing who the killer is.I'll give you a hint,he's only in one scene without a mask.This is what happens.Tommy Jarvis from part four is sent to a mental hospital in the middle of nowhere.It has no guards making it easy for the killer to get in.It only has about 13 people there.8 being patients.There was quite a cast of characters!You got Robin,the sensitive one,Violet(my favorite)the funky one note:She REALLY likes rock music,Reggie the only one who isn't a patient,Joey the stupid fat guy,I felt kind of sorry for him.There's a few more patients.I forgot there names.Theres a kid who studders ALOT,A psycho kid who kills Joey while chopping wood, perposly!And the couple who sneak out into the woods to do,well,you know what.You can guess what happens to all of them.Yep.SLICED and DICED!It's a good movie.No collection is complete without it.A+++!",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
307,GaryUncleGBrown,It's not that bad.,7,5 November 2006,"Just recently revisiting this film, I can say it's no where as bad as what some might want to make you to believe. Actually, it's par with just about all the other sequels that came out of the Friday The 13TH series. Naked / topless girls, the gore, people in the woods, it's all here. Yeah there is a twist to the story, but the movie as a whole still came out as good as any of the others. Not my own personal favorite of the sequels. That would be part X, or what I call; Jason In Space, but it's not a DVD I'm going to throw away either. It's as much a part of the series as any other one. No cure for cancer. No solution for world peace. Scares, and a few laughs. I would expect nothing more.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
308,aaronbusiness79,Just Another Slasher Film,3,22 August 2013,"This movie has a lead character that has no likability or lines for that matter. The gore is fun thanks to classic make-up effects. The run time is short enough that you won't contemplate fleeing the room. But, it's just a bunch of random killings taking place at a mental institution.I know people will say that all the horror movies are pointless killings. That is true. But, when the killer is Jason the movie has charm that overshadows the mediocre plot. Jason is essential for ""Friday the 13th"" movies. Think about all the times you accidentally or on purpose called the movies ""Jason"" instead of ""Friday the 13th"". Yes, this is an amusing slasher movie. But, it's no ""Friday the 13th"".",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

This is a dark, Tim Burton-esque type of film, and not for the weak @ heart. This movie has a lot of Sex, Drugs and Rock 'n Roll...which is what we want when we see horror...Right? The absence of Jasonisn't even apparent to most people who watch this film, but when studied...this movie is a hell of a mystery!!! Without reading any ""spoilers"" try and see if YOU can figure this one out! The theme song for this one is also great...done very well by ""Peseudo Echo"" called ""His Eyes"".

I hate this movie at this point because this is the third time they tried a who-dun-it? in the series and the outcome still sucks. They had the first film which had decent kills but had an unfair twist in introducing a character at the last minute. They had the second film in which I don't believe you were supposed to know it was Jason because that would not have made sense if you believe in time and dieing and poor Mrs. Voorhees' motives. Then there is this film which obviously was trying to catch some of the surprise success of the 4th film(which was promised to be the last).I can't really express my full opinion of this film without dissecting it piece by piece, but it honestly does not deserve the effort. Even in the spirit of Friday films, this is trash.....unless a drawn out daylight nude scene is enough to wave off 18-22 deaths(no gore), greasers in 1985, loud rednecks,a horrible mask, a horrible twist ending, and the man voted most likely to not look like Corey Feldman when he grows up who also knows karate.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

It all made sense when they revealed at the end who Jason.  But I would recommend Jason 6 for a classic slasher, I just wish all the kids would have died.....or maybe I am just morbid, anyways, the good key point of the movie lot of hot nude chicks from the 80's, but the one I really wanted to see, the goth raver, it never happend (sign) but oh well......",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
315,primefilmsct,'A New Beginning' was just that - a very good slasher film!,8,22 March 2010,"This is a true classic - I remember being younger and following the Friday the 13th series - and this came out and being only 11, I was like - is it Jason? or Tommy? I begged and pleaded for someone, anyone to take me...and I convinced my older cousin, he being 20, to take me. And he did.And WOW. Being 11 and seeing all those boobs and blood! I was blown away. This 'Friday' has the most nudity and sex of any of them up until that time and since!! And it held the highest body count up until the 2000's.What can I say? I knew these were just movies, was a huge fan of the series, and was enthralled with this film. Almost all the girls were hot, all the nudity got my attention, and you kept guessing - it must be Tommy! As we know now, it was Roy, the ambulance driver, and that was a bizarre twist and a downer at that. And looking at the film now, it holds up, but it may remind one of a Scooby Doo episode. This is a very good film, very underrated, and loathed by many as it isn't Jason and is an imposter. But go back to 1985....we didn't know who it was...and it was FUN! At least this was somewhat original and not crap like all the 'remakes' or 'reimaginings' that we get now.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning
316,ericyoder-543-584631,Very Underrated Film in the Series,9,1 August 2013,"OK lets get it all out that annoys people the most about this movie. Jason Voorhees is not the killer. In the film Tommy Jarvis (from the last film) is sent to a new place to get back to his own self like before the events of the Final Chapter. As he stays he and keeps going into fits of rage and having hallucinations of Jason, as this goes on real murders are happening all over the area by some unknown killer. I don't want to ruin it for people who haven't seen it but honestly behind Part 2 and 4 this is one of my favorite squeals. Many people bash this movie because Jason is not the killer which i think is ridiculous. People honestly don't think, in the original, Pamela Voorhees was the killer not Jason, Originally it was to be an only film, NO Jason, NO nothing. But many people liked it and wanted more. after Jason's death in Final chapter, they wanted to show he was really dead, by bringing in a new killer. I thought that was smart then keep bringing Jason back again. My main point is, Give it a watch! its extremely entertaining, there is a high body count and amazing score. Yes it has its week moments but overall its a lot of fun to watch. Any true Friday the 13th fan must watch!",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

Some things i didn't like from the movie is that there is a lot of nudity Tina is okay, Lana and Robin, why? Another thing, why did he killed Violet, that's not fair! I mean, she is cool, pretty and does robot dancing! The movie is obvious, but has a good plot, good actors, death scenes and more.

320,robertdowman,Classic American Horror movie,7,27 May 2016,"The film starts out on a rainy day and shows a young boy with a yellow coat walking up to Jason Voorhees's grave. He heard two guys coming. So he hid behind the bushes and he watched Jason come out of his grave and kill the two men. This movie was made on March 22, 1985 and it was directed by Danny Steinmann. The boy Tommy witness the police drop off two people named Eddie and Tina back at the Pinehurst mental intuition where they are currently staying. Tina and Eddie were caught having sex in the neighbor's yard and their neighbor hates them because no one respects her or her property. Later that day one of the other kids that lived at Pinehurst mental intuition got hit in the back several times with an ax by a man named Vic. Late one night these two guys named Vinnie and Pete, the local punk's went for a drive one night. But when they broke down Pete was being a mean and he made Vinnie fix the car because he didn't want to. When Pete left to take care of his business Vinnie got killed by Jason by putting a flare into the guy's mouth. When Vinnie got the car fixed Jason was hiding in the back seat and he killed him to. Friday the 13th is a horror movie. It is the 5th movie in the Friday the 13th series. The Jason format is a story of a vengeful spirit returning from his grave. This type of story has been handed down through the centuries. It's based on an ancient myth of a ""revenant"". The basic format is about revenge. I liked the movie because my friends and family freak out and I think it's funny because it's just a movie. I would rate this movie as a 7/10 because it wasn't as scary as I thought it would be but I did enjoy watching it.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

I think the movie would have been a lot better if Jason was the actual killer,and if it showed who was killing the victims,and Cory Feldman Should have played tommy instead of just making a guest appearance.But every other Friday The 13th movie is pretty good,Jason is the actual killer in all of them,and it shows him actually killing his victims a lot.",Friday the 13th - A New Beginning

Some really cool kills are also in this movie compared to some of the other Friday the 13ths. Also John Shepherd does a terrific job as mentally unstable Tommy.
