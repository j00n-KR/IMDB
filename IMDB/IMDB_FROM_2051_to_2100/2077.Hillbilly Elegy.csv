0,kosmasp,Childhood vs. Adulthood,9,15 January 2021,"Just recently I watched a documentary about child abuse. And this fits right into this. Or fits the bill as some would say. Now it makes sense that this is also based on a true story. The actors in this are phenomenal. But I do understand people having issues with this. Starting with the already mentioned abuse. Mental and physical abuse that is. And for some maybe really tough to comprehend how someone would be that way. But there are explanations and even when others (and myself included) may think: don't do it, there seems now way that is helping anyone at all ... that does not take into account what the characters feels that moment. The love for ones mother can be quite big, even when others may think it is undeserved ... another similarity between this and the documentary.This then is not an easy movie to watch at all. This will put you to the test or rather your patience. Try to take this for what it is, flaws and all included. It is not so much about what you yourself would do, but what makes ""sense"" for the characters to do ... Reality is not always rosy - and this movie is about just that. The tough moments, with very few light moments in between. Be aware of that",Hillbilly Elegy
1,classicsoncall,"""Cause family is the only thing that means a goddamn.""",8,11 February 2021,"This was a lot better than I thought it would be considering the trailer I saw. Based on the true story of J.D. Vance and chronicled in his book of the same name, I thought it captured perfectly the manner in which a person can escape their dysfunctional family past and become a productive member of society. Not without it's hardships of course, and an indomitable spirit that allows one to rise above one's circumstances when trouble rears it's ugly head. I've never been as entranced by the performances of Glenn Close and Amy Adams as I was here, and if the film receives consideration for this year's Academy Awards, I think those two will find themselves among the nominees for their roles. Both actors portraying the young and adult J.D. were also quite credible, but are often overshadowed by the domineering aspect of his mother Beverly (Adams) and grandmother Memaw Bonnie (Close). It's actually Memaw's tough love that appeared to have inspired J.D. along his path to adulthood, removing him from the stress of a new family paradigm and a set of 'friends' that could have led to his undoing. The word 'hillbilly' in the title shouldn't prevent one from watching this film, as the dynamic among members of the principal family in the story can serve as a stand-in for those of any income and education level. Remarkably, the closing credits silently introduce clips and still photos of the real characters portrayed here, and the casting of the principals couldn't have come closer to resembling the real people involved. Over all a worthy film and well recommended for it's life lessons.",Hillbilly Elegy
2,lee_eisenberg,the thing about growing up in a dysfunctional poor family is that you never escape the drama,10,28 November 2020,"Prior to watching ""Hillbilly Elegy"", I had read reviews calling it things like poverty porn, Oscar bait, and a missed opportunity to truly examine the characters. Ignore those descriptions. This is a look at how growing up in a dysfunctional poor family affects you for your entire life. Glenn Close's and Amy Adams's performances are like a brick in the face (and yes, I'd say that they both deserve Oscars for these intense roles). Definitely see it.",Hillbilly Elegy
3,jboothmillard,Hillbilly Elegy,6,28 March 2021,"When I heard the news that the supporting actress was nominated both the Oscar and Razzie for the same role, I thought this was the first time in history this had ever happened, in fact, it was the third time for an actor/actress. Amy Irving in Yentl and James Coco in Only When I Laugh are the other two. This film was getting both positive and negative reviews from viewers and critics alike, including nominations during Awards Season, I was looking forward to making my own mind up, directed by Ron Howard (Splash, Willow, A Beautiful Mind, Inferno). Basically, it opens in 1997 in Jackson, Kentucky. Teenager J. D. Vance (Owen Asztalos) is visiting his family with his grandparents and mother, Bev (Amy Adams). After which, they return home to Ohio. Fourteen years later, in 2011, J. D. (Gabriel Basso) is attending Yale and working three jobs. He is dating Usha (Freida Pinto), a young woman taking a summer internship in Washington D. C., which he hopes to do also. Following an event, J. D. gets a call from his sister, Lindsay (Haley Bennett), that his mother is in hospital after overdosing on heroin. Lindsay works and has three children and asks J. D. to come home to help. He feels conflicted about as it is interview week at Yale, and flashbacks reveal the difficult relationship he has with his mother. In 1997, J. D. lives with his mother and has many conflicts with her, because she is mentally and emotionally unstable, due to her addictions. He is a fan of Joe Montana and collects his cards. One day, as they are driving, his mother tells him she wants to move them in with her boyfriend. Bev starts driving like she wants to cause a crash. After stopping, she then beats J. D. He gets out and runs to a house and calls the police who come and arrest Bev. J. D.'s grandparents, grandmother Bonnie ""Mamaw"" (Oscar, Golden Globe and Razzie nominated Glenn Close) and grandfather Papaw"" (Bo Hopkins) come to pick him up as J. D. But seeing them, J. D. lies to the police about his mother hitting him and they let her go. Back in 2011, J. D. starts to drive to Ohio. When he arrives at the hospital, his mother is yelling at the nurse. She will be discharged because she has no health insurance. J. D. Is called and offered an interview for the following morning. In 1997, his grandfather dies, and a funeral is held with the family attending. Bev works as a nurse and steals drugs. She gets high, acts erratic and volatile, gets fired, and later breaks down the death of her father. In 2011, J. D. and Lindsey find Bev a bed at a drug rehabilitation facility. J. D. Remembers that attempts at rehab have never worked for her in the past. J. D. Pays for her rehab, but Bev ultimately refuses to be admitted. They talk in the car and he decides to take her to her boyfriend's house. In 1997, J. D., Lindsey, and Bev move into the house of Bev's boss and new husband, Ken (Keong Sim). Bev will not stop taking drugs. Mamaw falls and is hospitalised with pneumonia. To escape his chaotic home life, J. D. starts vandalising and acting out with his new stepbrother, Travis (Morgan Gao) and his friends. In 2011, Bev's boyfriend throws her stuff out of his apartment. In 1997 J. D.'s grandmother takes him to live with her as his mother cannot look after herself and needs help. J. D. Is initially still getting into trouble, including shoplifting an expensive calculator he needs for his studies. Mamaw in a tense moment explains to him that she is doing everything she can and says that he will not go anywhere unless he tries to work hard and do well in school. Slowly, J. D. improves himself, finding work in a grocery store and improving his grades. He grows up, goes to college, and joins the Marines, only returning home after his grandmother dies. In 2011, J. D. gets his mother a motel room. He momentarily leaves her to get some food and is shocked to find her about to inject herself with heroin, which he flushes down the toilet. She angrily attacks him, but eventually stops and sobs knowing that she needs help for her addiction. He knows that if he does not leave soon, he will miss opportunity at Yale. So, he calls Lindsay to come and look after his mother. Bev begs him to stay with her, but he reluctantly leaves her as his sister arrives. He calls Usha and talks to her to help him stay away during the long drive back to Yale. He surprises Usha, arriving earlier than expected, and makes it in time for his interview. In the epilogue, it says that Bev has been clean for a few years and she and J. D. are much closer. Adams gives a very showy but convincing performance as the addict mother with a short fuse, Asztalos is a good young actor, Basso does well as the grown-up, but it is indeed Close that is the scene-stealer as the matriarch being sweary and lairy, giving pithy wisdom and tough love. This is exactly the sort of film you would expect to come out during Awards Season, but you cannot deny that it is an engaging story, the back-and-forth structure is done well, and it feels like a truthful observation of how drug addiction affects a family, a worthwhile drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Makeup and Hairstyling, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Make Up & Hair. (I don't agree with the Razzie nominations it received for Worst Director and Worst Screenplay). Good!",Hillbilly Elegy

5,CinemaSerf,"Close, Adams and Asztalos do well here.",6,23 December 2020,"Upfront, I think it's fair to say that I found this whole story rather dull and depressing. Indeed, for much of it I was wondering why on earth anyone would choose to take this story - full of pejorative and downbeat references - and dramatise it at all. The performances themselves, however, are much more fulfilling. Amy Adams is superb as the addict mother whose son is heading down similarly disruptive tram lines before the intervention of his feisty grandmother Glenn Close. Based on a true story, it relates the not insubstantial trials faced by the family as their dysfunctional unit tries to make some headway against seemingly insurmountable odds. Close is so unlike anything I have ever seen her in before: dowdy, strong, angry, flawed - but determined that despite himself (and his mother) her grandson ""J.D."" (played well as a child by Owen Asztalos; less impactfully as an adult by Gabriel Basso) is going to try to make something of himself. The interweaving chronology of the narrative makes this a bit more interesting too, as they all have their demons to face down. Taken in isolation, the story is just a bit so what - but for once the dramatisation and screenplay give the talent plenty to work with and grim as it it, at times, it has engenders some feeling of redemption that helps it be a bit more than the sum of it's parts.",Hillbilly Elegy
6,Calicodreamin,Well acted,6,25 November 2020,"Undoubtedly well acted, Glenn Close and Amy Adams stole the show. The storyline was well developed and heartfelt, though a definite lack of plot and the timeline changes lacked some flow. The musical score was outstanding.",Hillbilly Elegy
7,ferguson-6,elevation by Amy and Glenn,6,23 November 2020,"Greetings again from the darkness. ""We don't use that word."" That is law school student JD's reaction when someone refers to those like his family as hillbillies. He's understandably defensive, despite his daily navigations between two distinct worlds. Oscar winning director Ron Howard (A BEAUTIFUL MIND, 2001) presents the true story of JD Vance, a young man who earns his way out of his Appalachian background to gain admittance to Yale Law School, only to get dragged back into the life he worked so hard to escape. Vanessa Taylor (Oscar nominated for THE SHAPE OF WATER, 2017) adapted the screenplay from Vance's own memoir.The first thing noticed about this film is that it stars Amy Adams (6) and Glenn Close (7), who between them, have 13 Oscar nominations for acting. That's a pretty distinguished pedigree for a cast. Ms. Adams has been seen recently in the TV mini-series ""Sharp Objects"" and as Lynn Cheney in Adam McKay's VICE (2018). Ms. Close was most recently nominated for her performance in THE WIFE (2018). Other notables in the cast include Haley Bennett (excellent in SWALLOW earlier this year), Freida Pinto (SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE), and Gabriel Basso (THE KINGS OF SUMMER, 2013).As the film begins in 1997, we find a young JD (Owen Asztalos) in a tough spot, and we quickly get a feel for the chaos commonplace around his family in Jackson, Kentucky ... and also the bond that comes with being a family in the hills. The obligatory family photo ends the segment. We then skip ahead 14 years as the family has 3 houses on the same street in Middletown, after some of them find a way out of Jackson. In this blue collar town hit hard by a financial downturn, they admit to missing only ""hope"". The story is told from the perspective of an older JD (Basso), who struggles with the emotional turmoil that his mother Bev (Adams) constantly creates. Remarkably, it's Mamaw (Close) who provides the strength and stability in the family, and yet, she always seems one small step from exploding at the universe. There is an odd grounded nature and tough-mindedness to Mamaw that Ms. Close radiates on screen. It's an interesting performance, that some may call over-the-top ... a phrase also likely to be used for Ms. Adams as she displays the desperation of an addict, and the broken spirit of one whose shot at life disappeared early on.For such a stereotypical ""simple"" family, the complexities of the story and characters are sometimes difficult to appreciate. JD's sister Lindsay (Bennett) does her best to raise her own family while also managing her mother and grandmother, so that JD can pursue law school. She understands he has possibilities, whereas she has few. And JD's law school girlfriend Usha (Pinto) truly has no concept of his childhood and family. Class differences are on full display not just with Usha, but also at the dinner where JD (a former Marine) is maneuvering to secure a summer internship that keeps him teetering in the balance of moving forward or falling back.It's at this point where JD receives a call from Lindsay informing that mother Bev has overdosed on heroin. It's yet another example of his own mother inadvertently subverting his efforts to make a new life for himself. Addiction, relapse, financial struggles, family abuse, and untold secrets are the pieces that make up JD's family pie. When his ""old"" life collides with his ""new"" life, will it drag him back down? He periodically faces decisions that are legal and/or morality based, and given his circumstances, it's never as straightforward as it should be.Without the power of Glenn Close and Amy Adams, director Howard likely would have had the film slide into the maudlin mode so common with Hallmark or Lifetime Channel movies, and while it's not the Oscar bait Howard aims for, Netflix has yet another watchable film in their stable. Mr. Howard's decision to bounce back and forth between 1997 and 2011 does provide the history we need to understand JD's dilemma, but the see-saw approach is at times distracting. Home movies provided by JD Vance are shown over the closing credits, and it's here where we realize just how closely Ms. Close physically resembles the real Mamaw. We walk away easily seeing how the circle of this life becomes perpetual, and just how challenging it can be to break free.",Hillbilly Elegy
8,blanbrn,Raw and harsh look back at a rocky and tough hard upbringing.,8,29 November 2020,"""Hillbilly Elegy"" based on a J.D. Vance memoir and well directed from Ron Howard is one brash, blunt and harrowing look thru flashback at a rural upbringing that helped influence and make one Yale law student. If one grew up in the rural South or Appalachian many can relate to many of the scenes of hollows, mountains, and just good loving country folk. Anyway the movie is a tale of upbringing and forming strong family bonds as this would shape one J.D. Vance from his Kentucky start thru Ohio living to his arrival at Yale law school till his meeting of his girlfriend Usha(Freida Pinto). Love is felt in the strongest and toughest form from Mamaw(in a transformative turn from Glenn Close) and the wild card of the family is J.D.'s mom the far out and eccentric Bev(Amy Adams) who battles her own personal demons of addiction. This picture does feel real and emotional as it's touching to show how family and a rough raising helped shape success and start a new journey in life.",Hillbilly Elegy
9,ksf-2,ron howard films are usually pretty good!,7,1 April 2021,"It's a Ron Howard film.. they are usually pretty good. From the humble Opie beginnings. Gabriel Basso is JD Vance, who escapes his dysfunctional, kentucky blue collar origins and makes it to Yale. He gets a call that his mom is in the hospital, so he heads home pronto. Not what he needs when he's trying to meet with the big shots to get his career going. Glenn Close is grandma, the only one who really looked out for him. Mom keeps using and OD'ing. JD needs to get to his interview. Flash back. Flash forward. Repeat. It's quite well done... it's the subject matter that's hard to watch. Written and produced by... JD Vance. Seems to be autobiographical. On the netflix. Has some similarities to Leaves of Grass, an Ed Norton project from 2009.",Hillbilly Elegy
10,lasttimeisaw,Cinema Omnivore - Hillbilly Elegy (2020) 6.6/10,7,11 December 2020,"""HILLBILLY ELEGY courts quite a lot brickbats from the critics (a divide between critics and audience has become a new norm), as I see it, the occasion is mostly due to its inopportuneness, its glorification of a white male privilege is particularly jarring with our current ethos, thinking of Lindsey, J.D.'s elder sister, play by Bennett with incredible magnanimity, who is saddled with a very different path of life because of what? She is a corn-fed girl, entering into a marriage and ministering to her parents is assigned to her like a sacred cow, and her unconditional acceptance in a way, says a lot about the author himself, if that whiff of male-chauvinism is not intended, it is because J.D. is just a common fruit of a jaundiced society. He succeeds and his sister doesn't, as far as the film goes, that does shriek for a sea change in gender equality, unfortunately, this is not what in the minds of the film's creators.""read the full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks",Hillbilly Elegy
11,ElMaruecan82,Who said Appalachian roots would contradict American ideals?,7,25 November 2020,"I want to start with a key scene in the beginning of ""Hillbilly Elegy"" when J.D. Vance (Gabriel Basso), a brilliant Yale student and aspiring intern in a prestigious law firm, doesn't hesitate to undermine his chances by rebuking a man's use of the redneck word. It's important to know that he's got ambitions but pride too, and we know we follow the story from the perspective of a young man whose values are still rooted in his Appalachian upbringing, values that don't contradict the American Dream ideals.Sure J.D. would never go as far as idealizing his tumultuous childhood but he knows he owes his success to the one one sacred value in Middletown, Ohio: family. Maybe his mother Bev (Amy Adams) didn't majestically embody these values but Mamaw, the family matriarch and pillar played by Glenn Close, sure the hell did. The poster shows the two women that made Vance's life, two women who seem to belong to the same rotten world but only one had the strength to elevate J.D. above it, that the memoir could have been written and become a best-seller is Mamaw's posthumous achievement.Now ever since its release, ""Hillbilly Elegy"" received such a harsh backlash that it seemed to have soiled its credibility as an Oscar contender but it also made viewers curious to see what's so bad about it... and speaking for myself, I realized that the film didn't deserve such criticism. I'm not American, I didn't read the original memoir (as a matter of fact, I never heard about it till now), but understanding the context before the content made me fear that the judgment toward the film would be clouded by political considerations. After watching Ron Howard's adaptation, I felt it was so devoid of politics that I don't think it should ever interfere with our appreciation. While not perfect, it's a rather well-made family drama with flaws that never undermine its genuine poignancy. For all the chaos surrounding Bev's life, the film is surprisingly serene.Speaking of Bev, another accusation was of Oscar baiting; fair enough, turning America's sweetheart Amy Adams into a lite version of the trailer-trash mother from ""Million Dollar Baby"" and having Glenn Close posturing as a grandmother who's the living antithesis of her glamorous and charismatic persona can pass as baits. But isn't that the stuff Meryl Streep has always been doing in movies that are mostly remembered for having earned her an umpteenth nomination? All of a sudden, critics seem to discover that this thing exists and decides to trash that movie that is no less guilty than any other to raise the attention of the Academy.In all fairness, the only bit of Oscar baiting and perhaps the most glaring weakness of the film is that Amy Adams seems to only exist in a pattern of scenes that start well and end on an incident, as to make a statement of the dangerous corners some well-meaning mothers can be driven to (violence, drug abuse etc.) or just to show how affecting hardship can be. Whenever she's on the screen, she either cries, shouts or does stupid things to the point that she inspires more pity and shame than true compassion. I think her character needed quieter moments like one she had with her son at the end when he talks about his supportive girlfriend Usha (Freida Pinto) or one flashback to show how that 'brilliant' woman started to screw up everything.I doubt the film does a great service to Adams by forcing her to go hysterical all the time and I think that damaged her Oscar chances. Now I might be in a minority but I think Glenn Close is a lock for a Best Supporting Actress nomination. And you know what? It would be a deserved nomination and maybe win. It's true the metamorphosis is so astounding it's literally a transformation but once you see the real pictures of Mamaw, you realize that this wasn't caricature. Besides, Close is used parsimoniously at key moments where she's shown as a a strong and caring grandmother and a true endearing character.Mamaw always had the conviction that this social rot was something that destroyed the soul of the South and if she could even succeed with J.D. in what she failed with Bev, her life would have meant something. J.D. is the hope of the family and Mamaw, as painful as it was to take him off his mother, did the right thing. Close plays the kind of mentor characters that earned Mahershala Ali his Oscar with the colorfulness of Meryl Streep in ""August Osage County"", if the Academy is consistent in its picks and still acknowledge talent, it should nominate her.""Hillbilly Elegy"" does a serious job in showing how the reputation of the bluegrass states can be understood but how unfair and dated are all these ""rednecks"" and ""deliverance"" clichés, it does so by avoiding a political stance à la Spike Lee and taking one specific example of a brilliant man who didn't forget his roots. And Basso delivers a performance not as showy and spectacular as Close and Adams but that's the point: this is a man who lived as an observer and in a state of passive acceptance until he was at an inch of falling and his grandmother could save him like T-800 with John Connors. Even as his young counterpart (Owen Asztalos), J.D. is a decent and well-meaning boy who knows good from bad. The appreciation of the film relies a lot on his rock-solid decency of that young man, and his sister (Haley Bennet) who also did well despite the circumstances.The editing is uneven and there might be one or two flashbacks too many or maybe a true confrontation between Mamaw and Bev was lacking but if the film is a critical flop, narratively (and emotionally, too) it works.",Hillbilly Elegy
12,MOscarbradley,Typically uninspired Ron Howard fare.,4,27 December 2020,"The one thing you're guaranteed with a Ron Howard film is professionalism even if there may be a dearth of imagination. The lack of imagination in ""Hillbilly Elegy"" extends to the title which is one of the poorest of a mainstream film this year. It's another growing up and coming-of-age saga in, dare I say it, Hillbilly country and it's well enough made; beautifully photographed and designed, like so many Ron Howard films and equally lacking in imagination which isn't to say you might not enjoy it. For starters, Howard has cast two of the best actresses in America as leads; Amy Adams is the Po' White Trash Mamma, (she's old enough to take mother roles now), and Glenn Close is the Po' White Trash Grandma and they are both excellent in very conventional roles.It's the biography of one, J.D. Vance, (Gabriel Basso as an adult and Owen Asztalos as the younger version), a Yale law graduate who manages to break free from his family but who is forced back when his mom od's on heroin and it's based on the book he wrote about his family. Even if you didn't know it, you could still guess this was a Ron Howard picture and that's not a recommendation. Howard's 'autership' means all his films look and sound alike in the way that Reader's Digest novels were all alike, aimed at people who didn't want to try the real thing. This movie is condescending in the extreme; Oscar-bait fare for Adams and Close and very typical of its director.",Hillbilly Elegy
13,Cineanalyst,"""Someone Else is Gonna Have to Step In""",3,26 November 2020,"I haven't read venture capitalist J.D. Vance's memoir, and I have no plans to. I'm surprised to read others describe it as a political text, though, in light of having just seen this adaptation of ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" which is such a vacuous picture that it's hard to believe there was ever any sort of substantiated ideology there. I guess there may be slight moments leftover, such as Glenn Close yelling the quotation in the headline above about responsibility, and that's something Close's character finally does after her grandson is corrupted by unemployed youth. There's also that CGI factory that disappears in the Rust Belt landscape. Seems quite bare, though, as does the supposed representation of Appalachian and Middle-American culture, or the ""American Dream"" stuff. J.D.'s turnaround from rebellious youth to diligent student is even reduced to a montage. The voiceover narration and timeline jumping hardly helps. If it was more of this sort of banal socio-economic and political banter mixed with an opioid PSA that made the book a bestseller, I'll continue to feel confident in my decision to read something else.As far as the movie goes, I choose to read Close's aforementioned line reading as a call for someone competent to take over this movie and do something interesting with it already. Ron Howard directed ""Apollo 13"" (1995) and maybe a couple other half-decent pictures, but much of the junk he directs screams ""hack."" At least, this one is less mawkish than some of the rest of his oeuvre, but nothing particularly interesting happens nonetheless. I only saw it because it stars Amy Adams and Glenn Close. I can't think of Adams ever being less appealing, and that has nothing to do with her appropriately assuming a more ""down-to-earth"" look for the role. Everything she does here is simply based on movement, from the start with the shaky camera following her strides, to that nightmare car ride with her son, the roller skating through the hospital, and that spectacle in the street. It's a waste of talent.Close eventually takes control of the thing. It seemed inevitable what with an actress of her stature hanging in the background for most of the picture. She steals the show with the tough-love, chain-smoking granny act, ripping her IV out, to walk out of the hospital and go adopt her grandson. Never mind, I guess, that her flashback and assuming narration of the picture is entirely inconsistent with a movie otherwise from the perspective of J.D., not to mention the mystery of why she was sick in the first place and seemingly managed to be cured by will power alone. J.D.'s voiceover narration and the drama of whether he'll make it to a job interview in time after finding a room for his drug-addicted mother or whether he'll make nice with his girlfriend is such a trite drama, though, that I'll take what I can get from a great actress at least pulling off a solid superficial characterization. Of course, Close was better in reflexively intelligent movies such as ""Albert Nobbs"" (2011) and ""The Wife"" (2017), but everybody in this has been better elsewhere.",Hillbilly Elegy

Performances by Glenn Close & Amy Adams were Oscar material, especially by Glenn Close who after bunch of nominations should win for a best supporting actress for this movie - she was barely recognizable from anything I saw her before - its a powerhouse acting. Also actors who played J.D. Vance at different ages were both great - this is a one superbly acted movie.Overall, ""Hillbilly Elegy"" is a really entertaining movie about family.

As soon as he arrives there, we watch some flashbacks of his childhood and also some family moments that were very unpleasant.I have to admit that due to some critics I was skeptical about this movie but after watching it I cannot understand them. It's an interesting movie that contains many unpleasant moments but I can understand them since I was prepared of watching a drama movie. The direction which was made by Ron Howard, it was very good and I found very interesting the way he presented some very sensitive issues. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, Glenn Close who played as Mamaw, Amy Adams who played as Bev and Gabriel Basso who played as J.D. Vance, were simply amazing. Another thing that has to be mentioned was the selection of the cast that was also very good, something that was obvious in the end of the movie when there were a small presentation of real photographs and videos of the people that ""Hillbilly Elegy"" based on (on the book of J.D. Vance). In conclusion, I have also to say that ""Hillbilly Elegy"" is an amazing drama movie and I suggest you to leave the critics aside and watch this movie unaffected.",Hillbilly Elegy
19,cruise01,Strong family drama with great performances.,6,7 December 2020,(3 out of 5 stars).Hillbilly Elegy is a fair drama film about a family who are struggling to stay together. J.D. (Gabriel Basso) is in yale. Trying to go into law firm. When he gets a call from his sister Lindsay (Haley Bennett) about there mother Bev (Amy Adams) overdosing on heroin. He leaves his busy life to go home to his family to help his mother. While the film also flashes back in J.D. earlier years as a child and how he also struggled dealing with his unstable mother which she had mood swings. And unable to take responsibility. While there grandmother Mamaw (Glenn Close) spent a lot of time. Trying to raise the kids to make better choices.The plot is an emotional powerhouse. Striking a strong family drama. And relatable issues with family trying to overcome addiction. The film also struggles with its pacing issue with present time and flash back to certain events with J.D. earlier years. Of dealing with his mother abuse. And having great moments. Then getting into trouble with other teens. While Glenn Close tried to raise him right. By telling him to stay focused in school and away from trouble.Great performances by the cast ensemble. Amy Adams did a great job. Gabriel Basso and the kid actor playing his younger self.

20,zkonedog,Look At The Fringes Here And You'll Find A Solid Film,7,3 December 2020,"When ""Hillbilly Elegy"" was released, it was immediately met with savagely negative critical reviews. In a certain sense, I get it: the film could very easily be described as ""Oscar bait"", yet the writing/screenplay does not live up to that designation (or even come close, in all honesty). But, if one can get past that contradiction and sort of look at the fringes of ""Hillbilly Elegy"", you'll find a perfectly solid, well-acted family drama.For a very basic overview, this movie sees J.D. Vance (Gabriel Brasso), who is trying to break into Ivy League educational tracts, called back to his childhood hometown by sister Lindsay (Haley Bennett) when their mother Bev (Amy Adams) overdoses on heroin. While traveling back to Ohio, a series of flashbacks fleshes out the story of Young J.D. (Owen Asztalos) and how the family came to be how it is.Right off the bat, the immediate glaring weakness of ""Hillbilly Elegy"" is that the narrative really lays it on thick. It features none of the nuanced subtly that define truly great films. This is a bit odd considering that director Ron Howard usually delivers better overall products, so I'll lay the fault at the feet of the screenplay. Perhaps, being based on J.D. Vance's memoir, the writers were loathe to venture too far from the source material. Either way, there are times when the story plays out like something you would see on a made-for-TV movie.Yet, those narrative failings do not in any way completely torpedo the rest of the viewing experience. The fact that the story is indeed based on true events actually helps the proceedings in certain ""truth is stranger than fiction"" ways, and when the credits roll to comparison photos/videos of the real-life actor counterparts, you'll likely be amazed how close the characterizations really are.The acting here is also top-notch. The next bad performance out of Adams would be her first, so no problems there. Who really steals the show, however, is Glenn Close as ""Mamaw"", a matriarchal family figure. This is truly an award-winning performance and provides much of the legitimate emotion in a film that can be a bit over-the-top in that department. I'll remember Close's performance here for quite some time.Overall, ""Hillbilly Elegy"" isn't going to be the darling that perhaps it was presented as. It simply isn't punching up to that weight class, so to speak. But if you can look at it with an eye towards acting and a realization that it is based on someone's life events, much enjoyment can be found.",Hillbilly Elegy
21,eddie_baggins,A soulless awards baiter,4,3 December 2020,"If you ever wanted to see Netflix attempting to fish for Oscars, you need look no further than the streaming giants latest high-profile awards baiter The Hillbilly Elegy.Directed by the seemingly stuck in a rut Ron Howard, whose been unable to achieve much of late since his last truly solid effort in the form of 2013's Rush with In the Heart of the Sea, Inferno and Solo: A Star Wars Story all disappointing efforts in the grand scheme of things, Elegy is based on the true story of author J.D Vance's colourful upbringing at the hands of the ""Mountain People"" of his family that includes troubled single mother Bev, cantankerous but kind-hearted grandmother Mamaw and softly spoken sister Lindsay.Taking a decades spanning approach that takes us from present to past with little care or consideration as Vance tries to push forward with his life as an adult and overcome the traumas of his chaotic childhood just above the poverty line, Elegy tries its hardest to showcases just how hard life is for these people but there's a distinct air of Hollywood/Hallmark about Howard's film that never feels like it earns its stripes as it tries desperately to make us root for Vance to overcome his early life to achieve a successful outcome.The best of these type of family centric award winning dramas feel real and lived in, almost documentary like at times is their realism and accuracy but while Howard may be sticking close to Vance's tales from his book, something about this product as a film never clicks into gear, even though its not the ""worst"" film of the year as its been labelled, more like one of the most disappointing when you consider the talent involved.Howard's proven many times previously that he can handle a loaded ensemble and powerful story but his direction of Elegy is one that is akin to a director on sleepwalking mode, nothing about the film feels overly ""prestige"" while detrimentally the usually fantastic Amy Adams delivers one of her most over the top and seemingly miscast performances as the drug-addled Bev.Many a time throughout the film Adam's overacting and almost caricature redneck routine doesn't ring true and takes away a lot of the films chances of becoming emotionally connecting.The work of the films other players is slightly better, Gabriel Basso as the adult J.D and Haley Bennett do decent work while the Oscar hunting Close may veer at times into Adams overacting territory but brings her turn as the wise and determined older family matriarch into a solid direction with her committed role one of the highlights of the otherwise by the numbers affair.Final Say -A film that feels familiar and never at home with itself as it tries desperately to make us care as it shoves its hapless characters and moments into our faces, Hillbilly Elegy has a few redeeming moments that save it from complete failure but this is neither as engaging or powerful as it clearly thinks it is.2 trading cards out of 5",Hillbilly Elegy

We see footage of her at the end of the film and I reckon if you put them side by side it would be hard to tell them apart. Gabriel Basso also gave a passable performance, although that could've just been down to the fact that he was the only likeable one amongst the bunch.When someone tells you this is based on a true story you're more than welcome to ask them - what exactly was the story?

Director Ron Howard captures the despair and frustration due to lack of opportunity and family dysfunction but the film runs overlong hammering its point home with the protagonist's train wreck of a mom (Amy Adams).""Hillbilly"" JD Vance is on the verge of breaking the family cycle of poverty and ignorance as a bust out law candidate from Yale. Seriously involved with an Indian girlfriend he's scheduled to interview for a major position with a firm but wouldn't you know it his drug addled old mom threatens to sabotage everything.Most of Elegy is in flashback of JD (Owen Aztalos) growing up in the midst of dreadful circumstance his Mamaw (Glenn Close) doing her able best to keep the boy on the right path while mom bonds on occasion between fixes and boyfriends. Amy Adams is powerfully infuriating as the old lady, blaming the world for all her problems inflicting great emotional pain on JD. Glenn Close is simply her equal as a wobbly tower of strength trying to hold the family together. Howard's direction is poorly paced with overlong phone conversations and an excess of mom infractions, the depressed state of Middle America disposed in perfunctory montage. There is little comic relief to be found and Howard pouring on excess glum asks for the same patience mom does with her incessant drug use when both call for tough love.

29,CubsandCulture,Yeah no Trumpism is not about economic anxiety.,4,26 March 2021,"As a film onto itself this is a boring rote melodrama about a poor boy trying to escape his family's history. I was greatly bored by so much of this film. Howard directs in a basic, workman manner so that the film comes across as a lifetime movie with a budget and a couple of F bombs. The script is perfunctory and literally nothing happens that is unexpected. The film is technically very lackluster. The acting-while good-is completely undermined by every other feature.With that said I find this film's existence annoying. Vance's book is a bizarre work of self-pity and self-indulgence. Vance treats his experience as universal for his region which takes a lot of gall to do. Vance's suspect politics also crop up in the book-and film. Notice how it was a Black cop that restrained his mother but a white crop who released her. But most of all this film exists because liberals wished to explain Trump's election without condemning large swaths of America. But if the shoe fits...",Hillbilly Elegy

33,masonfisk,NOBILITY FOR THE UNWASHED...!,6,5 April 2021,"Ron Howard's (Splash/Apollo 13) latest from last year, a Netflix original, tells the tale of J. D. Vance, a man who overcame his red neck past (a term he doesn't like to use) to a career first in the military & then a lawyer. Told in fractured flashbacks, we learn of the roughshod upbringing he underwent under his always in trouble mother, played by Amy Adams, a sometime nurse in a hospital but due to poor choices w/men she'd invariably would have sporadic bouts of drug abuse. On the cusp of Vance's interview w/a law firm (for a position he desperately needs because of his familial ties, he's in vicious debt), he's lured back home (due to his sister's phone call, played by Haley Bennett) to handle Adams latest drug binge. Seeing how Vance had to be the linchpin of the family, especially after picking his grandmother, current Oscar nominee Glenn Close, to stay with who put him on the straight & narrow, we understand his need, nay his fealty, to be loyal to his family but after a while, whether true or not, the audience will go through its own periods of eye rolling & hope a modicum of tough love would saturate the roots of this troubled clan. I appreciate this yarn is a vision most viewers will know about but really hasn't experienced on the big screen in some time (since these kind of stories are usually peppered w/bromides of overcoming adversity) but being wrong in retrospect doesn't mean anything if the same mistakes are still perpetuated. Gabriel Basso is quite winning here however, overcoming the limits of his character w/the supporting players, namely Freda Pinto (nice to see her again!)

And Amy Adams is right behind her, affirming she's no slouch. The story line is a pure Horatio Alger story of Ragged Dick or Tattered Tom. It could make one wonder if J. D. Vance stumbled across these tales in some dust covered stack in a Yale library and thought why not string together a memoir that would fit well within the current political landscape.I grew up in Ohio and can recognize the territory of a town once filled with life thanks to the steel mills that provided a job to anyone with a strong back. Then those same mills closed, and the story goes, leaving behind a decimated economy and bitter ex-employees drinking ""boiler makers"" and cursing those who escaped. That's too easy.It is true for me that outside of my uncle, and a handful of of other neighbors, college graduates were rare, but we were encouraged to do well in school, get a college degree, and have a better life than our parents. I was always puzzled that as my friends and acquaintances got those college degrees, they became Republicans. And they became Trump supporting Republicans.

What are you doing?,6,6 April 2021,"In my quest to watch as many Oscar nominated movies as I can before the awards, I knew I was likely to run into some spectacular films, and honestly I have. There are great movies I may have never gotten around to were it not for this little self-given quest. However, it's unreasonable of me to expect them all to be knockout winners and that's what we have here. Hillbilly Elegy feels like an Oscar-bait movie. A man trying to make something of himself despite/in spite of his humble origins that keep trying to drag him down only to be the very thing lifting him up. Never heard that one before, right? Sounds exactly like the kind of thing the academy might love.If I'm being honest though, I kinda did enjoy this one. After a quick glance it seems like I'm in a minority here but I enjoyed this movie. Now, a big part of that is because, sad as this may be, parts of this reminded me of aspects of my own family growing up. Now, we were never what I'd call hillbillies but we weren't exactly well off either and there were definitely some seedy relatives that I could always count on to be up to no good. So as I'm watching this, I can relate a bit to what's going on here, at least in spirit and to that end the movie did connect with me. Also, Glenn Close really surprised me here and I can see why she's getting the supporting nomination because she is almost unrecognizable in this and she plays a wonderfully complex character than I quite enjoyed.Why I'm not giving this a better review comes back to the Oscar bait thing though. All of this feels so hollow. It's an aspartame emotion running throughout this film that never quite feels right. It also never deviates from the expected path. It's pretty obvious the way this whole thing is going to turn out from the jump and while I don't always need to be surprised to enjoy something, constantly retreading familiar ground gets tedious. For a movie like this, I needed more from Adams, especially when I know she is capable of it and then some and I need more from Basso. As the ""lead"" I need him to be able to carry this movie and his whole monotone approach to everything and lack of emotion just makes it tough to properly invest. I think he's going for a ""emotion just below the surface"" vibe but, sadly, it doesn't seem like he has the chops to pull it off quite yet.All in all, Close is solid and I found parts of this engaging but overall I doubt this is something I'd recommend to most people. There's just not enough here. It's close to being something great but ends up landing just above ok for me. If it's on, it doesn't hurt to watch but beyond an urge to watch Oscar flicks, it's probably not worth it.",Hillbilly Elegy

Unfortunately, much as one can sympathise with J.D. (and his grandmother Mamaw, played by Close), J.D.'s mum is the insufferable Bev (Adams), a manic-depressive with a narcissistic personality.Bev is a terrible mother, not only because her string of boyfriends make for an unsettled family life, but mostly because she's so busy feeling sorry for herself and her disappointing life that she cares for nobody.Bev was a top student but ended up pregnant and with a humdrum job as a nurse, for which she blames her kids and not her decisions. Enters Mamaw, who takes in J.D. in, before he gets completely ruined by Bev and from there, it is more or less plain sailing.Except it isn't because the story is told in flashbacks so that we have a constant stream of Bev's hysterics about everything. Therefore, the annoying flashbacks and the insufferable Bev make the movie a stressful experience rather than an elegiac one.However, Close and Adams do a good job, though Adams is really OTT with her manic portrait of the emotionally unstable Bev.

41,jadepietro,A Compelling Family Melodrama,8,28 November 2020,"JIM'S REVIEW: (RECOMMENDED) Welcome to another portrait of The Dysfunctional American Family. With a capital D! Let's call it Hee-haw Hell in Ron Howard's overly melodramatic but compelling film, Hillbilly Elegy, based on J.D. Vance's novel.Mr. Howard's direction is solid, and he captures the hopelessness of the lower class economic struggle most efficiently with his images of boarded up shops and closed factories, but the main weakness in his film is its disjointed screenplay by Vanessa Taylor. Her script continually jumps back and forth in time with its non-linear structure. Movie scenes are stitched together haphazardly like a beginner's patchwork quilt. Some are very effective; others seem overwrought and contrived. Together, they never build to any genuine emotional epiphany. The film is too episodic in its editing and storytelling that one wonders if pieces of film remnants were left on the cutting room floor. There are gaps in the timeline of events in the Vance family and their history that remain missing and the film never give us the full picture.While some of his casting is uneven, other actors interpret their parts with much nuance and verve. In the role as the main protagonist J.D., Gabriel Basso and Owen Asztalos are serviceable but slightly miscast. They never bring any pathos or a convincing sense of despair to their roles. However, it is the female clan in the film that bring the words and story of family abuse and poverty to life. In their few scenes, Frieda Pinto as J.D.'s devoted girlfriend and especially a wonderful Haley Bennett as his stoic sister are quite wonderful and make their characters more than mere stereotypes. But the real reason for seeing Hillbilly Elegy are the strong performances by Amy Adams as Bev, a junkie mom and abused daughter, and Glenn Close as Mamaw, a tough-as-nails grandmother who takes on anyone who dares to draw near. They are wonderful.Both Ms. Adams and Ms. Close are decked out in their Oscar-worthy worst...all haggard, angry, and worn. Their screen personas may be unrecognizable, but their acting is, once again, memorable. Some critics have criticized their overt emoting as an Oscar grab and complained that these fine actresses left an overabundance of sawdust in the wake of all their scenery chewing. But I found both skillful performers to deliver excellent performances throughout the film.Hillbilly Elegy expertly shows the socioeconomic conditions that trap many families in the spiraling-down of hope and personal pride. Where the film loses some of its footing is in its soap opera origins and blatant stock characters as its spokespersons. Still with Ms. Adams and Ms. Close along for this hayride, you can't go wrong.

But that doesn't mean every one of those stories is worth making into a movie. HillBilly Elegy is a terribly bland and depressing look at the life of a guy who grew up in an abusive household, continues to struggle with a drug-addicted mother, but found a way to overcome the difficulties of his young life to become a successful law student. This is on the same level as the old after-school specials we had in the 1980s, or a modern Lifetime movie. There's nothing that made this story original or even interesting to watch. It fell into so many cliches that I was getting dizzy from rolling my eyes. For instance, can we all agree that we never need another scene about some stupid hick not knowing what to do with all the silverware at a fancy dinner?One big problem was that I don't think Hillbilly Elegy benefited from non-linear storytelling. They weren't linking scenes between the two timelines much, and so it only served to lessen the impact of certain moments, because we have to wait for another flashback (or flash forward.) Of course, since this was all based around someone's real life story it feels true, but this is the type of story we've all seen before. Sure, the makeup work and performance of Glenn Close were great, but the film is rarely focused on the difference her character made in the protagonist's life. And it seems, because the film is based on an autobiography, it is afraid to truly villainize anyone. The end result is an unfocused and milquetoast tale that is completely underwhelming.

49,bankofmarquis,Decent with 3 strong female performances,6,14 April 2021,"Glenn Close is one of the most lauded Actresses of our time and her current streak of 7 Academy Award nominations without a win is a record. It would be ironic, indeed, if she would win her first Oscar with this, her 8th Oscar nomination, this time as Best Supporting Actress in HILLBILLY ELEGY.Written by Vanessa Taylor and based on the book (and true story) by J. D. Vance, HILLBILLY ELEGY tells the tale of J. D. (naturally enough), who overcomes his impoverished roots and dysfunctional family background to become a star Law Student at Yale.Gabriel Basso plays J. D. as the Law Student and he is just not charismatic enough to shine in this role especially as he goes up against 3 talented actresses that have PLENTY to sink their considerable acting chops into.Close plays ""Mamaw"", the grandmother of the clan. She is a no-nonsense, pragmatic matriarch that lives and breathes (through cigarette clogged lungs) ""Family First"". It's an interesting and strong performance by Close, but she does teeter into ""Granny Clampett"" territory at times for me. It's a good performance...but the one that will finally get Close her Oscar? I don't think so.Amy Adams steals the movie as J. D.'s mother (and Mamaw's daughter), Bev. She is (as we say in these parts) ""a whole thing"". Her Bev is self-centered, clawing, desperate and constantly wondering why the world doesn't give her the things that she is deserved. Nothing is EVER her fault and if you don't believe me, just ask her. Adams' performance is the strongest in this film and she never crosses the line into caricature.One last moment of credit needs to be given to Haley Bennett as J. D.'s sister Lindsay, who is often the one stuck taking care of their Mother. When I first saw Bennett a few years back in 2016 in back to back strong performances in THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN and THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, I thought we were watching the emergence of a star. It's good to see her on the screen again.Credit for these performances must go the unlikely person helming this film, good ol', reliable Ron Howard who's workmanlike Directorial instincts and style lends itself very well to this, often told, type of story. It's nothing flashy, but gets the job done.And that pretty much sums up my feelings towards this film ""nothing flashy, but gets the job done"", not the greatest film to come out in 2020 - but it is layered with 3 strong female performances by Adams, Bennett and Close so that makes this film one good enough to check out.Letter Grade: B-6 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Hillbilly Elegy

It was so sweet, I read one review after the movie and it said it was not as sweet as the Memoirs. I did not read the book but I can imagine it was cool! I loved the film because it was so nice and I love the lil' boy and he was so sweet and he grew up , in spite, of everything he grew up to be a fine lad! and it was so so sweet!

51,Ruskington,"Good, but not as good as it could have been",6,11 December 2020,"Amazing lead performances carry the rather routine story along. Glenn Close is exceptional but should have been given more screentime. Amy Adams is wholly believable and it's great to see her take on such a challenging role although she maybe pushes it too far at times. The constant timeline shifts make the film disjointed and sloppy, detracting from the quality of the acting and sincerity of the story. Ultimately it ends up as a rather formulaic feel-good movie when it should be nothing of the sort. As for the rabid coastal elite negative reviews, what more would you expect from these woke imbeciles?",Hillbilly Elegy

53,bob-the-movie-man,General shouting and a glowering Glenn Close,5,22 April 2021,"I missed Ron Howard's ""Hillbilly Elegy"" when it came out at the end of last year, but principally wanted to catch up on it to see Glenn Close's Oscar nominated performance before Sunday's Oscars.Positives:
When this film started, I suspected that the Glenn Close nomination might be another 'Judi Dench in Shakespeare in Love' - - where her acceptance speech is longer than the time spent on screen! But no. Because of the flashback format deployed in the film, she actually gets a good amount of air time. And it's a really solid and impressive performance.The supporting cast is also good. Amy Adams is given a lot to do with a challenging role, and (just about) pulls it off. And young Owen Asztalos as the younger J. D. particularly impressed me.Negatives:
Although it's based on J. D. Vance's true life story, I really struggled to get very invested in the story. The choppy nature of the narrative - hopping repeatedly between 'the present' and multiple flashback timelines - really doesn't help with this.The whole J. D. / Usha romance element almost felt like it belonged in a different film. In fact, I found it frustrating that I found the elements with J. D.'s struggles at college, with the emerging love and guidance of Usha, as a more compelling narrative than the druggie mother lead story. Perhaps the movie was just trying to be too ambitious?Apart from one 'personal decision' scene in a motel bedroom, there's not much of an ""up-side"" to the story for the viewer to take away. It's not a movie that I found a positive experience.Viewer Advisory;
If you've had any history of life in a dysfunctional family, there is a lot of shouting, slapping and general tension in this movie which you might find disturbing.Summary Thoughts:
So, I came to this to see the performance of Glenn Close, and it's very good. I would personally be surprised if she takes the Oscar for this. However, having been nominated eight times before and never won, the 'sympathy vote' may play here.But one of my bellweathers for a movie is to think whether I'll remember it in six months time. I'm afraid this one is unlikely to pass the test. If you say ""Hillbilly Elegy"" to me in October, I'll probably recall a whole lot of shouty people and Glenn Close glowering at me from the screen. That's not a wholly great recommendation for a movie. Sorry Mr Howard, but this one's a 'miss' for me.(For the full graphical review, please go to One Mann's Movies on t'interweb or Facebook. Or not.

Vance.As an adult J.D. is reading law at Yale University. Struggling to pay tuition fees by working 3 jobs.J.D. is shown in a separate timeline as a child where we see his mother, Bev Vance (Amy Adams) suffering with a drug addiction over several years.The chaotic childhood is shown affecting J.D. and his sister Lindsay. (Haley Bennett).
J.D.'s grandmother or Mamaw Vance (Glenn Close) is the matriarch of the family and we see her becoming an ever increasing influence on J.D.'s upbringing at one stage stepping in and looking after J.D., keeping him on the straight and narrow and encouraging his school studies.Glenn Close is made up with prosthetics and make up that make her look more like Mrs. Doubtfire (1993).Close's performance is a far cry from probably her most famous role as Alex Forrest in Fatal Attraction (1987). Indeed as of writing she is nominated for Best Supporting Actress at the 2021 Academy Awards for here role as Mamaw.We see J.D.'s family poverty line American's moving from the Kentucky Appalachia region to Ohio.At various stages I as a U.K. resident saw the bluntness of the U.S. healthcare system and it's credit card costs not encountered with our National Health Service.Indeed this film has some political implications which are evident in it's negative critical response from large elements of the mainstream media.Occasionally this happens. Going totally against mine and the majority of the public audience!There are several examples in the movies, Bohemian Rhapsody (2018) and reality (Brexit, Trump...).Director Ron Howard has brought the book to the screen successfully. A real rags to riches story as good as Rocky (1976) in that respect.The story is set in the U.S. but could just as easily be moved to anywhere in the world with class divide.",Hillbilly Elegy
57,Movi3DO,Beautiful and Heartbreaking,9,16 March 2021,"Yeah take me home country road. Based on the memoir, a Yale Law student drawn back to his Appalachian hometown reflects on his family's history and his own future.This movie moved me to tears. I felt very bad for the main character and what he had to go through in his childhood as well as 14 years later. The story was heartbreaking and tough to watch at times. However, I was still hooked into the story and got on an emotional ride for the whole almost 2 hours runtime.The acting was marvelous throughout, especially Glenn Close and Amy Adams as the grandma and the mom, respectively. Close as the grandma showed a person with certain regret in the past and tried her best in the remaining year taking care of our main character J.D. and made sure he had a chance of a bright future. Amy Adams was amazing as a mother who could have a great life, but was ruined because life didn't always go right. The character was maddeningly unstable, which made me feel more sorry for the character as well as those around her.The theme was about how individual choices can get one out of a tough and chained life. However, that life was still the main factor that shaped the person.Overall, a beautiful and emotional movie that painted an ugly life and showed how one can still rise above that. 9.5/10As for critics' ratings, they were absolutely ridiculous. Don't look at critics' rating on Rotten Tomatoes, but instead look at the Audience's rating, which better reflected the movie. As for previous movies, I was still confused and abhorred at how certain people use outside and unrelated politics to judge a movie. This movie was released around the peak time of the mess that was Trump's end of presidency. Somehow the movie's region's political affiliation and race was used as a major determination to rate the movie. This is toxic and head-scratching.",Hillbilly Elegy
58,msbreviews,"Hillbilly Elegy is not as bad as it seemed, but it's not good either...",5,18 November 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)This film is based on a memoir of the same title written by J.D. Vance, the man who gives name to the main character or, in better words, the character whose point of view is what the movie describes. As I always do, my preparation for any film means I don't watch trailers nor try to know too much about the story. I knew this movie was based on a supposedly true story or in some sort of book, and I knew that this could very well be an Oscar-bait due to the talented cast and late date of release. That's it. I had no idea about its political background nor Vance's personal statements. I'm from Portugal, so I don't live in a Republicans vs. Democrats or a Red vs. Blue country. Politics is and always will be an extremely irrelevant, depressing, unimpactful topic in my life.I don't live in the USA, so unless the controversies surrounding films are global problems, I couldn't care less about them. To me, Hillbilly Elegy looked like another family melodrama featuring lousy parenting, drug addiction, bullying, discrimination, and all those formulaic plot points developed in this type of movie. Expectations-wise, I couldn't avoid the first (tremendously negative) reactions from fellow critics on social media, so I prepared myself for the worst. However, there's a reason why I wrote this prologue above, explaining my origins and what I consider to be important in my personal life...Not trying to justify other people's opinions (everyone has their own right to love/hate any film for whatever reasons they choose to), but it feels awfully clear to me that a lot of American critics were influenced by the real-life J.D. Vance, his memoir, and what some people interpreted about his point of view. I repeat: everyone is in their own right to hate this movie (it has more than enough reasons to, and I'll get to those), but I find ""the worst film of the year"" statement as exaggerated as the movie's overdramatic sequences. My biggest issues with Hillbilly Elegy concern its editing choices and its looping narrative structure, besides its generic developments of known cliches.Starting with the first problem, Ron Howard (Solo: A Star Wars Story) should have managed to create a really great film from the original story. At its best, Hillbilly Elegy could have been a heartbreaking account about the emotional struggles of living in such a violent, problematic family and about trying to escape this harsh lifestyle and reaching a better life overall. However, the constant flashbacks to J.D.'s young life damage the viewer's connection to the character and the rest of his family members, especially his mom, Bev. The non-stop back-and-forward in the timeline breaks the movie's pacing (James D. Wilcox's editing lacks consistency and coherence) and leads me to my next issue.The entire film is a cycle of dramatic scenes quickly escalating to unbelievable actions. From the repetitive drug abuse and consequent relapses to the horrible parenting displayed in the most random of fashions (in one minute everything's fine, in the next one, chaos ensues), Vanessa Taylor couldn't break her screenplay loop, and Ron Howard failed to realize these sequences in a distinguished manner. In addition to all of this, Hillbilly Elegy also does very little to avoid the common formulas regarding this type of narrative, possessing zero surprises throughout the entire runtime, ultimately being entirely predictable practically from the beginning.Nevertheless, as I mentioned before, this is far from being a contender for the worst piece of cinema in 2020. In fact, it might even get some nominations in the awards season, including the Oscars. As usual with ""real-life stories"", their cinematic adaptations always fill the end credits with images or videos of the real people portrayed in the movie. It's easy to notice the impressive work made by the make-up department. Glenn Close looks incredibly similar to the real Mamaw, and her charismatic portrayal is definitely getting her some nominations, at least in other ceremonies besides the main ones. She delivers yet another emotionally compelling performance, packed with powerfully handled dialogues, detailed expressiveness, and a phenomenal physical display.Amy Adams (Justice League) doesn't fall behind. If Glenn Close has chances as a supporting role, Amy Adams might receive a few Best Actress nominations. Her character, Bev, doesn't receive a fair treatment script-wise, but Adams tries her best to compensate for that flaw. Her performance might be considered extremely over-the-top for many viewers, and I do acknowledge some exaggeration in a couple of scenes, but overall, she delivers a superb interpretation. Gabriel Basso is also pretty great as J.D. (as is Owen Asztalos), same for Haley Bennett (The Devil All the Time) as Lindsay. Hans Zimmer and David Fleming's score is sweet, but it doesn't get too many moments to shine.In the end, Hillbilly Elegy suffers from its formulaic narrative stuck in a tiresome loop of overdramatic scenes that escalated incomprehensibly way too fast. The predictable melodrama features questionable editing decisions that hurt the film's pacing and overall story consistency, as well as the viewer's emotional bond with the characters. Ron Howard and Vanessa Taylor fail to depict an interesting premise in a distinctly captivating manner, consequently resorting to the award-worthy performances of Amy Adams and Glenn Close to save the whole movie from total disaster. In addition to the outstanding displays from the two actresses, the remarkable performances from the remaining cast elevate the flawed screenplay, ultimately delivering a few scenes worth hanging on to. Technically, impressively accurate make-up (guaranteed awards buzz) and a lovely score deserve a much better film. I still recommend it to everyone who enjoys melodramatic family stories, but don't expect anything remotely special.Rating: C+",Hillbilly Elegy
59,mahmus,It tries too hard and accomplishes too little,4,31 March 2021,"It feels like it's trying way too hard to be maningful instead of letting the story do the job for itself.Almost every scene has the characters having a giant burst of emotion and it makes the few geniunely touching scenes have less impact. There's so much melodrama packed into every second of this film that it all feels meaningless in the end.Glenn Close is probably the best thing about this movie and she's responsible for some of the more subtle and effective dramatic moments. And while this might one of Amy Adams' worst performances, she's still clearly giving it her all.In the end, this is just a giant mixed bag of good intentions and a big desire to win awards. The final result isn't terrible, but it's nowhere near as effective or as moving as it clearly wanted to be.",Hillbilly Elegy
60,maccas-56367,Inspiring story of breaking the cycle,7,6 December 2020,"This wasn't nearly as bad as I had anticipated. Its pacing and use of flashbacks was jarring at first, but I soon found myself drawn into their world and rooting for JD to break the vicious generational cycle on display.Glenn Close stole the show with her portrayal of ""Mawmaw"" and had numerous scenes that had both humour and emotional weight to them. The rest of the cast mostly just phoned it in. Amy Adams was good without being remarkable. Gabriel Basso as the 'adult' JD character was very wooden, and occasionally drew me out of what I was watching due to this.I'm not American, but can understand a lot of what is depicted here. You find it everywhere, among all countries. I also have American friends with whom this would hit too close to home. Those same American friends would probably never watch a film like this. In a film that heavily relies on being able to identify and relate to what is happening, this is perhaps an issue.We all have family though, and the majority of us have challenges to deal with and overcome in life. It's these commonalities which provided some of the emotional punches for me.This type of film has been done many times in the past and often better. In some ways it feels a little like Riding In Cars With Boys meets Boyhood. Heavily flawed, but with its heart in the right place, I enjoyed it for the most part.",Hillbilly Elegy
61,MrDHWong,"Tells the raw, confrontational story of one young man with great acting and the harsh realities of life",7,14 January 2021,"""Hillbilly Elegy"" is a biographical drama film based on the memoir of the same name by J. D. Vance. Directed by Ron Howard (Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind) and starring Amy Adams and Glenn Close, it tells the raw, confrontational story of one young man with great acting and the harsh realities of life.In 2011, Yale University student J. D. Vance (Gabriel Basso) travels back to his hometown in Ohio to visit his mentally unstable mother Bev (Amy Adams) in hospital, who has overdosed on heroin. As he tends to her needs, J. D. reflects on his childhood fourteen years earlier, growing up with Bev's emotional outbursts and impulsive behaviour constantly getting in the way of any potential future prospects for him. Regardless, J. D. finds some inspiration from his grandmother ""Mamaw"" (Glenn Close), who despite her own problems, tries hard to ensure him that it is still possible to have a better life than she or Bev ever had.The dysfunctional family is a common trope in movies today. This is because it can offer a fly-on-the-wall look into the lives of a family whose conflict can provide a solid driving force to motivate a character (or characters) to get out of this toxic environment and pursue their dreams. With ""Hillbilly Elegy"", this is definitely the case, even though it has a tendency to impose it upon us every step of the way. From the very beginning, we are shown how our protagonist J. D. is suffering greatly at the hands of his mother, so much so that it becomes difficult to watch as he puts up with all of this abuse that he enables her to inflict on him. While I do appreciate that the film does not sugarcoat its depiction of a rough upbringing, this approach makes it near impossible to feel any sympathy for the abusers as they are given too many second chances to improve themselves. The problem here is that the film wants us to feel sorry for Bev the entire time and like everyone around her, we should believe it when she says she'll do better next time. Of course, anyone with half a brain will think that she is a lost cause and J. D. should just cut her loose and move on. I found scenes like these frustrating to sit through as I have seen first hand how some abusive people have manipulated loved ones into doing their bidding by giving the ""I'll do better next time"" defence, only for them to relapse into their old ways and continue mistreating others. As this film is based on a true story, I suppose I should give it some benefit of the doubt regarding its representation of domestic disputes, even though I can't say I was entertained by what I saw.Under the direction of Ron Howard, we see the American Deep South in all its fundamentalist glory during flashback scenes of J. D.'s family in their original home state of Kentucky. Here, Howard shows us that there are other families similar to J. D.'s with their own individual stories on how they each get by and how they all adhere to own familial standards of living. This is likely a commentary on the sad state of how many young people growing up in poorer communities have that fixated belief that they are doomed to lead a life just like their parents before them, incapable of breaking away from the monotony of such a basic lifestyle. It is certainly a depressing thought to ponder upon, and as previously mentioned, the film does not attempt to diminish the impact of this with too much sentimentality or silver linings. At the same time though, I would have liked to have had some relief to this bleak outlook on life with more scenes of J. D. enjoying college life to show how far he has come, but they are seldom featured throughout the story.The one thing I absolutely cannot fault this film for is the realism of its acting. The ever-reliable Amy Adams gives everything she has in her performance as Bev, even though her character has virtually no redeeming qualities. It is difficult for me to say she was great though, as Bev seems like such a horrible person and praising her would feel as though I am endorsing that character's behaviour, but Adams did her best to bring out some spark of relatability in the way she played her. Glenn Close also did a nice job as Mamaw, Bev's mother, who also has her fair share of serious issues but is at least able to admit when she has a problem and doesn't try to blame it on everyone else around her. However, I must give major credit to both of the actors who played J. D. at different times in his life - Gabriel Basso and Owen Asztalos. Each of them were highly believable in their roles as the same person, showing how poor J. D. just cannot escape the toxicity of his homelife no matter where he is.While this film may have been difficult to sit through at times, there was actually a decent ending to it all. Without giving away spoilers, I did find J. D.'s story interesting enough to remain invested until the very end, hoping there will be a successful outcome to his persistence and for the most part I was satisfied. Of course, it is obvious that something good came of all this due to the film being based on a best-selling memoir but I can't help but wonder if the real J. D. will ever be over his traumatic experiences. It still makes me sad that there are other children out there who haven't been so lucky, but at least we can take comfort in the fact that one of them was able to make it.I rate it 6.5/10",Hillbilly Elegy
62,Alexander_Blanchett,Glenn Close is brilliant,8,24 November 2020,"It was a good film. Pretty standard but good and kind of heartwarming. We had ""troubled-family"" movies before also based on the Hillbilly ""Culture"". Its intersting to see a film out of the perspective of a kid growing up with those troubles who seems to be very honest about his memories and created a loveletter to his Grandma who is wonderfully played by Glenn Close who should be your main reason to watch this film, if you need one. She was fantastic. At first you would think she is very cartoonish and plays a stereotype but boy did she grow into this role and developed it so wonderfully that at the end you couldnt get enough of her. A great turn that hopefully brings her Oscar glory at last.
Amy Adams was also good but she can do better. It was a fine performance with many good moments but other than with Close's performance you sometimes noticed the acting wheels turning. Still a fine performance after all. Gabriel Basso was okay but beaten by the kid who played the younger version Owen Asztalos. Still not sure wether Haley Bennett is a good actress or not but she was okay.
The direction by Ron Howard was nothing special, sometimes there were some weird cuts that didnt make too much sense. Definitely not his best job. In the end though it is very worth to see, mostly for the accting showcases of Amy Adams and especially Glenn Close.

The film did get a really bad reception from critics and whilst I don't think it's a terrible film, it's one that I don't think is very good either.Hillbilly Elegy follows J.D. Vance, a Yale law student, who returns to his hometown after receiving an urgent phone call where he reflects on his Appalachian family and future.Ron Howard has made movies in the past that I have enjoyed and seeing two amazing actresses like Glenn Close and Amy Adams in a movie like this made me believe they were finally gonna get their overdue Oscars but sadly that might not happen. Glenn Close still may have a chance since she did a great job in the film itself and it's surprising to see how closely she resembled J.D. Vance's real grandmother. I've always loved Amy Adams and she also does a decent job in this film even though there were times where I thought she was a bit overdramatic.The real problem I have was the way the story was handled. There is a lot that happens over the course of the film but it didn't make me feel much. The story had so much potential to flesh out the characters and create some very powerful moments that would've made me emotional but that wasn't the case. The screenplay by Vanessa Taylor is pretty weak and doesn't feel honest. I understood J.D. Vance's perspective but the character seemed quite bland to me. Gabriel Basso was fine but there wasn't much to him. Young J.D. Vance played by Owen Asztalos had more to work with compared to Basso but the screenplay and editing hindered me from fully connecting with him. Taylor's treatment of the other characters appeared one dimensional to me. I felt there was so much more to Bev and the troubles she dealt with but the film doesn't explore it to a greater extent. The film does have a few scenes that are meant to evoke emotion but the editing doesn't allow that emotion to flow. The use of slow motion and choice of cuts did ruin the emotional feeling I was meant to feel during the more dramatic scenes.Overall, Hillbilly Elegy is just another forgettable Oscar bait movie. The acting from Close and Adams keep it afloat but the treatment of the story doesn't work in the film's favour.",Hillbilly Elegy

What adds to the story is this is based on the real life story, making us even attentive and receptive of the story.
What did not work:
I believe one of the prime reason the movie got hammered by the critics is because they have read the book before and the movie did not meet their expectations. I personally, having not read the book, and by just as a movie viewer loved the movie. It's heartbreaking and heartwarming at times.

No, we don't find out how JD managed to get himself into Yale Law School, but that wasn't the story, so just knowing he is there is all the viewer needs to know. With the bombardment of political news we are hit with every day, I particularly enjoyed that the film did not get political at all. And all of the performances are excellent, even the minor roles.

69,sweidman-28016,Not As Bad As the Reviews But Still a Mess,5,18 November 2020,"""Family's the only thing that means a goddamn. You'll learn that.""Before I actually get to the review portion, I think it's crucial to discuss the significance of Hillbilly Elegy. I didn't know anything about it till after watching it. The only thing I knew was it's based on a memoir and that there was a bunch of hype around it. The hype I knew about was for awards and all that. Turns out there's much more to this. Hillbilly Elegy is about the ""American Dream"" and is a voice for Appalachian individuals coming from the point of view of J. D. Vance. Well J. D. Vance has some controversy around him. He has different views than others, is very conservative, and made some comments about Appalachians and how they ""talk about working more than they work."" He kind of trashed talked the roots where he came from because he built his way up into society. This focuses on both his childhood and his return back home in 2016. His mother struggled with drug addiction which altered his childhood significantly. J. D. worked hard in school, joined the marines, and graduated from Yale law school. Because of his work ethic it's kind of known that he thinks he's above some of these Appalachians who won't achieve the ""American Dream."" The memoir supposedly discusses themes of the culture of poverty since he grew up in not the greatest conditions. Anyway, that's as much as I know. Some people think this is a great story and some find it offensive. So there was hype for not only awards but for this project in general.Now that we've covered that, this movie throws all that away. Most everyone, whether you follow movies or not, knows about the scathing reviews this received. I understand that. And Rotten Tomatoes goes by either liking it or hating it. Only 28% actually gave this a positive review. What I'm more focused on is the MetaScore review since it's a most accurate score of every critics review. A 40 is still not great but that makes more sense. Hillbilly Elegy is a mess, but it's not as bad as some of the reviews say it is. Everyone has hype around certain movies. This had a lot going for it. First there's the source material. Then the stacked cast including Amy Adams and Glen Close. Venessa Taylor wrote the screen play who previously was nominated for an Oscar for The Shape of Water. And this seemed to be the comeback movie for Ron Howard who hasn't been consistent, well kind of ever. Rush feels like the last good movie he made. This just isn't it. Mainly due to the poor writing. Venessa Taylor has good moments of writing with some dialogue that could win the actors Oscars, but those moments are only once in a while. Most of it is either basic or cringe-worthy. I feel so bad for Amy Adams because of the writing, but I'll get to that later. The storytelling is inconsistent. Jumping back and forth between past and present can be difficult to get a constant full effect. The present 2016 moments have no effect whatsoever. I felt nothing for these characters at this point. The past scenes have more entertainment value and a more interesting story. There's just never a moment of normalcy. Every scene must have something significant happening where a character has to be demonized. A chance to slow down a breathe never really happens. For those excited for the screenplay, this might be one of the worst of the year.Remember when I mentioned Amy Adams earlier, now's the time to tackle the acting. Adams doesn't deserve all the hate she's getting for this role. She's being accused of overacting and giving a terrible performance. But when the only scenes she has are her having a meltdown, flailing around, and just being an overall terrible mother it's hard to get to the route of the character. It's not her fault and I do genuinely think she gave an excellent performance, but her chances of an Oscar nomination are basically gone. Then Glen Close. We all thought this would be the year she finally wins her first Oscar. She's extremely overdue and gives a great performance. This just isn't her best ever. Once again the writing is taking those chances away. Close has a transformative performance and gives her all every minute on screen, but to give an Oscar for this performance wouldn't be appropriate. Mamaw is the one who is there to keep J. D. in line when his mother can't do so. But all she does is say stuff like ""you need to do better"" and ""family is all that matters"" and ""I wasn't always a good person but you can be."" There's not a moment to slow down with her. Olivia Colman might win the Oscar over her again. It seems unanimous that Owen Asztalos playing younger J. D. has a better performance than Gabriel Basso who plays him in 2016. Older J. D. is just an asshole to me. I hated him almost every minute. He's so cocky and thinks he's the one who is in charge of this family. I was in utter disbelief at the end of the third act with him. A decision is made that I understand is important to him but no decent person would ever do that. What's even worse is he's painted as a saint because he got everything he wants. If this weren't a true story I think everyone would be so mad at how this ends. Younger J. D. on the other hand gives a more genuine performance and is good. The last person that must be mentioned is Haley Bennett. When will she land a role with a movie that will be appreciated? She great in every role and I actually liked her in this, both acting and character. Even with Swallow and The Devil All the Time (both movies I really enjoyed) those movies have not gained the appreciation needed to have her well known. Good performances by most of the ensemble but can't get to their fullest potential with the bad writing.Ron Howard just seems to have lost clear direction. Maybe not his worst movie like most are saying but there's a lack of fluid direction. Right away it comes off as a basic movie. Honestly if the writing was just better I still believe this would still be pretty basic. He can get some emotional scenes down. I did feel bad for the situation and wanted everything to get better. And there are some enjoyable and entertaining moments. I didn't find myself hating this. But it's just a disappointment from the some choices made both in the story and a filmmaking standpoint. For example, the past scenes are all in handheld mainly. I felt motion sick at some points. It's a common technique to get more immersed into the story but it was just too much. Also the fact to neglect the whole voice of poverty and all that doesn't help. This might be more of a writing thing but it's those topics aren't discussed as much as they should. I really can't say I hated this. I wanted to finish the movie unlike the other two people in the theater who left halfway through. Hillbilly Elegy is a mess, but it's not a movie to skip completely. It'll be on Netflix soon so you won't be wasting any money. I for one just wanted to see it in theaters while available to me because I'm pretentious. It's a shame that the final product couldn't live up to the hype. To make it quite simple, this is 2020's The Goldfinch: so much hype around to only time get awful reviews and a disappointment.",Hillbilly Elegy

75,dansview,Wasted Bo Hopkins,7,24 November 2020,"I'm not sure that it is the film maker's responsibility to show examples of people living the opposite of how the main characters in any film live, but it would have been nice in this case.Because we see so many shots of trashy, dysfunctional people in the neighborhood. But I'll bet that even that neighborhood has plenty of clean, high functioning people too. Let's not slander Appalachia.Meanwhile, I've seen Amy Adams play trash before. It's not that hard to do, unless the trash is nuanced, which this wasn't. But Glenn Close was memorable. Partially because we rarely see trashy old ladies portrayed in films. But I felt some soulful energy from her.I agree with the others that the kid actor was great. He really looked like he was going through this stuff and processing it along the way without cynicism.
Contrary to reviewers, I liked the adult version too. He had that look of burden on him at all times. Like he wasn't sure his life was really going to work out, even when it seemed it was on the verge of doing so.I felt uneasy with an aspect of the girlfriend he chose. Or at least how she was depicted. But if that's how she was in real life, it's not my business. She seemed a bit condescending toward him. Like he was her cute little heartland, working class teddy bear. But ultimately she was very supportive.Look, no one wants to spend two hours watching dysfunctional losers batter each other. I was checking the time clock to see how much more I had to take.
Were there potential ways to make this thing less obnoxious? Perhaps.Like showing us an experience he had in the military that helped shape him. Or how he met his girlfriend. Or the way that church, God, or politics affected people. We never heard anything interesting from the grandpa, played by a fine and famous actor Bo Hopkins. Yet it turned out that he was the cause of most of the dysfunction originally.Did he have any remorse? Did he have anything interesting philosophically to add to the scenario?One thing worthy of mention, and this is not a popular concept, is the role of genes in our life story. They did bother to let us know that the druggie mother had been very bright academically, and sure enough, academics were the boy's salvation. But could he have excelled academically without that gene?So maybe it wasn't just the grandma's tough love, or his own perseverance that got him where he got. It may also have been the combination of tough genes that got him through the Marines, and academically smart genes that got him to Yale.",Hillbilly Elegy
76,jimmycoffin-751-212853,Ron Howard fails again.,1,22 February 2021,"The Main Problem with Ron Howard dramas are that they all feel out of touch with the characters. The emotional effect He tries so hard to tell In his movies never pays off. They become cringy Instead. Unlike His counterpart directors from the 80s 90s like like Fisher King, Awakenings, Shissorhands, Breakfast club, stand by me, notebook etc. Those classics connects on a deeper level because how the scenes are filmed. It flows.In Hillbilly Elegy, It's impossible to care for the characters because they jump between time all the time. whimpy kid with no friends, girlfriend so no interesting Is happening here.
As an adult an arrogant every day bore.
Everytime we see the mother She's In some tantrum or just loosing It. So all her scenes that's supposed to be emotionial, like when she cut herself or od on drugs. Are derrived of the cause to care about her situation. We see a flashback of her as a child in a closet. That's It.
The only interesting and good part Is Glenn Close.
I never seem to finish watching a Ron movie,
And I quit watching Hillbilly when It was 15min left. I just couldn't take the padded soapy scenes. Making a huge deal over nothing 'scenes'. And movies I can't finish watching gets a 1 Star.

Thankfully the cast is top notch; Amy Adams is terrific and Glenn Close delivers a fiery and fierce performance.

79,vjnambu,Leave the critics,10,29 November 2020,"Hillbilly elegy was one film I was really excited for only one reason- hans zimmer reuniting with ron howard who made rush whose direction and music helped the film to be a masterpiece. I hoped they would repeat the same magic with hillbilly elegy. I heard the soundtracks of it before watching the film and hans zimmer didn't disappoint at all and made me more excited for the film. Trailer promised it to be an emotional family drama.
The film narrates the story of jd, who is a student at yales, doing several part-time jobs to earn money who has to return to his ailing mother suffering from substance abuse and has to leave next day for an important interview for his internship. The film goes back forth, how jd's childhood was affected due to his mother's drug addiction and multiple relationships and how his mamaw comes to rescue his future.
Heard all the negative reviews before watching the film which i couldn't understand. They say there is too much yelling. But that might be how some families behave. I don't find any problem with the film. Its very emotional and heart touching. There are so many families suffering due to any of their member's substance abuse and ron Howard captured it brilliantly. Casting was very good
Coming to performances, its glenn close as mamaw who steals the show. She was perfect as mamaw. Look at the end credits showing the original family and glenn looks exactly like mamaw. Amy adams was fantastic as the drug addict bev. Gabriel basso was also very good and the child actor also. Both of them look exactly the same.
Hans zimmers music suits the film perfectly. Its emotional as well as motivating which is still ringing in my ears.

2020

Director: Ron Howard
Starring: Amy Adams, Glenn Close, Gabriel Basso, Haley Bennett, Freida Pinto, Owen Asztalos etcOverall rating 22/100The Hillbilly Elegy is about a yale law student who is drawn back to his hometown as he grapples with three generations of family history and issues, and the American dream. The Hillbilly elegy had all of the elements of an awards contender but didn't execute any of them at all in an absolute mess of a movie, lets get started.First of all, the movie had good cinematography, some interesting themes, some good chemistry between characters and great performances. The movie did look visually amazing, the set locations were excellent and well explored adding to the visual appeal of the movie. I thought some of the themes of the American dream and the prejudice of Hillbillys was well explored and expressed well the struggles of people having judgments on them before even knowing them, linking that to the main character trying to get into top end universities but being proud of his heritage was good. I thought the chemistry and the connection between the main character and Glenn Closes character, her being the motivation for JD (Gabriel Basso) for being a better person and motivating to achieve things in his life was heartwarming and powerfully thought out. I also have to have hats off to all the performances in this film because they were excellent. Gabriel Basso and Owen Asztalos were absolutely excellent as JD, they were powerful, emotional and authentic, Glenn Close and Amy Adams also did an excellent job with the poor material they were given, their performances were powerful, nuanced and hard to watch in places so they were excellent.However, my first few negatives would be the unnecessary character conflict, rushed beginning, odd narrative choices and a clunky narrative and pacing. I thought that the movie created way too much character conflict between everyone, the movie positioned each of its characters against each other, they were all bitter and horrible towards one another and it all just felt unnecessary and made the film very hard to watch due to the lack of connection to the characters. I also found the beginning very rushed, when they were establishing the character background for JD and his family I would of wanted the movie to spend more time fleshing out the characters before cutting out to modern day, I just felt like the movie didn't spend long enough developing the characters or having some form of relationship to connect with. I also found the narrative choice to switch between past and present very strange and it often didn't work for me, I got most of my connection with the characters despite it being limited when JD was younger and having it when he was older didn't work for me, this constant switch between tenses also made the narrative and pacing very clunky, it got very irritating spending a limited amount of time in the present and then cutting to the past, to the point where they were over relying on it to create character development and from a screenwriting perspective for me it was just messy and made the pacing extremely off.My next couple of negatives would be the bad character decisions and over the top melodramatic tone. I personally thought that a lot of the characters made horrible decisions throughout the movie, if the movie was supposed to make you connect with the family and reunite and be happy it managed to achieve the complete opposite, they were so horrible to each other I was genuinely questioning why they were still a family in the present, I also thought the movie had way too much of a melodramatic over the top tone, the movie had nothing positive or hardly anything uplifting whatsoever, it was all a bunch of people dieing and crying and it was just too much.My final few negatives for me would be the lack of connection to the characters or emotional connection, and the movie poorly handling its deeper themes. I had absolutely no connection to the characters whatsoever, I disliked pretty much all of them, and whenever the movie tried for a powerful and moving moment I just felt nothing and completely emotionally disconnected, my biggest issue with the movie had to the how poorly it handled the movies deeper themes, the way the movie portrayed abuse and drug addiction was almost insulting and horrible to watch, the whole movie felt completely against Amy Adams character, there wasn't one single sign of her wanting to get better, and they just portrayed her as a horrible human being, this will offend and upset a lot of people and the movie really poorly handled these themes that require a lot of thought and sensitivity to be included.Overall, the hillbilly elegy is made partly watchable to due to it's fantastic performances, but I was completely disconnected from the movie, it's script was poor and often offensive, it's pacing was all over the place and it really poorly mishandled its deeper themes which made me stop watching before the movie even ended.",Hillbilly Elegy

85,dommercaldi,"Loved The Memoir, And Would Highly Recommend It, But The Film Is A Bit Of A Let Down",5,26 November 2020,"*I've just finished reading the memoir, and absolutely loved it. Hopefully this film captures the raw and uncompromising reality of the white working class that the memoir captured so beautifully. Congratulations to J. D. Vance, you have truly come far.Pros:
1. Haley Bennett (Lindsay), Amy Adams (Bev), Glenn Close (Mamaw) and Gabriel Basso (J.D. Vance) all give fantastic performances.
2. The score not only blends in with the hillbilly background, but it also foments the tender and intimate moments.
3. There is electric chemistry onscreen, particularly between Gabriel Basso and Amy Adams, as well as Glenn Close and Owen Asztalos (Young J.D. Vance).
4. The scaled-back cinematography helps to give the film a raw and honest overlook of the events.Cons:
1. Some of the editing is far too corny with needless slow-motion and numerous cuts, which are more annoying than emotional.
2. The pacing is way off with events just sliding by with no proper focus on them, and other events quickly brought and then forgotten about. It seems like Ron Howard (Director) had a checklist of things to include in 2 hours and was simply ticking them off.
3. Pointless melodrama, that wasn't in the memoir, is inserted and it feels cheap, cheesy, in addition to being a lazy way to force emotion. For example, J.D. Vance never goes off on the interviewer for saying the word ""redneck"", in fact, none of his interviewers mention that word.
4. The non-linear story-telling doesn't work as it shows J.D. Vance at Yale Law School before the entirety of his childhood. The reason why J.D. Vance reaching Yale Law School is so impactful in the memoir is because you journey with him through his highs-and-lows. Moreover, there doesn't seem to be any coherence in the way the story is stitched together.
5. There's not enough focus on the hillbilly culture and the consequences of it, which is a theme that pervades the memoir.",Hillbilly Elegy

87,danybur,"A gruesome, meritocratic redneck melodrama",4,14 December 2020,"J.D. Vance (Gabriel Basso) is a law student at Yale about to have a fancy dinner to access an important job. But he receives an urgent call from his sister asking him to return to the Ohio town where his mother Bev (Amy Adams) has just been admitted. This leads to a series of powerful flashbacks about J.D. (Owen Asztalos) with his mother and with his grandmother Mamaw (Glenn Close).
I wish the only problem with this Ron Howard film was that permanent temporary alternation that does not allow either of the two plots to consolidate.Hillbilly Elegy is a hideous melodrama where poor J.D. the boy deals with a violent and later addicted mother, whose misfortune haunts him even in his adult life, and a calmer grandmother but with a turbulent past that is also in conflict with her daughter. They want to present it as a strong drama but it is a grotesque succession of screams, blows and emotional blackmail, over-acting and bordering on caricature. More than elegy, an excess of white trash and redneck miserabilism of ""deep America."" Absent (and violent) parents and grandparents, a witch mother and a former (?) witch but savior grandmother. Only sister Lindsay (Haley Bennett) and ... him, of course, are saved. The spirit of Hillbilly ... resembles that of The Devil All The Time, only the latter is more pretentious and with more characters.Obviously, this film had to be based on real events (for Hollywood this is always a merit) to enhance its ""testimonial value"": a memoir of Vance himself, already a successful lawyer, a best seller where it seems that he takes revenge on his family by portraying her without pity and incidentally passes us the meritocratic message of ""I still succeeded with a horrible family but in their loving way."" This is not exactly a Return to Reims...The final titles with photos of the real J.D., Bev and Mamaw could not be missing so that we can see how well they disguised the actors and actresses. For Hollywood, the physical transformation and characterization are absolute merits - how Amy Adams got fat for her role!Sadly, some will see this Oscar-pretended freak as ""a deep drama like life itself"" with ""intense and risky performances.""A pity that actresses of the stature of Glenn Close and Amy Adams have lent themselves to get into the skin of these grotesque and ""Oscar-winning"" characters.",Hillbilly Elegy

89,scb_coldsteel,An ultimately shallow and forgettable presentation of rural Appalachia,6,27 December 2020,"So I watched Hillbilly Elegy on Netflix. I've heard quite a bit of mixed reactions from this film. Acting-wise it's supposed to be Oscar-worthy, but the overarching story told by Ron Howard supposedly falls flat. Overall I would say it is a bit of both.Story-wise the film follows a young man going to Yale University attempting to get in touch with his rural Appalachian family in a moment of crisis. Through a series of flashbacks the film maps out life in a small Appalachian town and introduces a unique cast of personalities. All the while the film shows how rural poverty and drug addiction can impact a family.At its heart the film illustrates the hardship of rural poverty and how drug addiction severely impacts those communities. Unfortunately for the film it does so with a relatively simplistic manner that ignores the intricate socioeconomic factors that create poverty and substance abuse in the first place. Instead the film decided to go a relatively safe cookie cutter route of showing the virtues of hard work in the face of hardships. A relatively lazy presentation that cutaway any controversy purely for a feel-good friendly experience.There certainly was a story to be told here but the manner in which it was told leaves much wanting. I honestly expect nothing less from Ron Howard at the moment. He has firmly set himself recently as a safe feel good director. Even in his directing choices the use of flashbacks in the film were relatively disjointed and uneven. Often it slowed the narrative down, but that largely seemed by intent to distract from the overall shallow presentation of the content. Everything about the presentation choices really just made the film feel like Oscar bait. Not necessarily bad but ultimately hollow.The film certainly missed an opportunity to bring life to rural Appalachia. Everything from the characters to the setting simply felt like set pieces. There was so much wasted potential to craft a case study regarding the effects of drug use and post industrial decay on a Appalachian community. I normally don't criticize a film for what it should have been but there is just so much wasted potential.Acting-wise I will say the film certainly deserved praise. Glenn Close is truly a chameleon. She transforms herself in every role and this is no different. Physically she perfectly embodies her role but her mannerisms and pattern of speech are absolutely spot on. Of course Amy Adams is a treasure and she really brought life to the characterture like role she was presented. Physically she transformed herself but again emotionally she delivered some of the best moments in the film. I wish the story was better to match the performance these two titans brought to the film.I really wanted to like Hillbilly Eulogy. The film had such potential to tell a story and present a subculture that deserved representation outside of traditional stereotypes. Unfortunately Ron Howard went the easy route and made a safe film that is sure to make some viewers tear up and pump their fists with it's overly simplistic feel good ending.I expected substantially more and I suppose that was my fault. Ultimately you shouldn't judge a film for what it isn't but I can't help but criticize a film that perpetuates harmful stereotypes while refusing to address the actual issues the film brings up. Ultimately this was an utterly forgettable film with some solid acting and mediocre storytelling simply for mass appeal. Do better Ron Howard, a 5.75 out of 10.",Hillbilly Elegy

94,mirwais-orbit,"Great acting, and that's it.",5,4 December 2020,"The thing about Ron Howard is that he likes to take people by the hand too much, leading them all the way through the rollercoster instead of just put them on the rail so they can enjoy it by themselves. A family drama like this one, so much layered by problems and traumas of at least 3 generations could've been so much better if the director had chosen a less obvious path, which should have been a more honest one, and not driven entirely by drama formulas like Howard is so used to for so many decades. Screenplay by Vanessa Taylor doesn't help either. The overuse of flashbacks throughout the story to homeopathically reveal important matters for no other reason than tie audience thru its never ending 120 minutes is also what makes this movie never works as it could.What does make this movie enjoyable is the acting and make up. Owen Asztalos is magnificent as young J.D. I'm a huge fan of both Amy Adams and Glenn Close's work, what a great partnership. Although Amy's character is so lost in the writing that feels like she was cast for it only because she's so talented that no bad writing can stop her from raising so low bars. Screenplay wastes most of its time trying to justify all the time every action and reaction of the characters instead of developing a coherent arc that could make us understand more clearly the reasons that made that family trully dissolve. Screenplay makes Bev takes most of the responsibility on her back, which obviosly is not. All the answers are thrown randomly and in the end feels like nothing makes much sense at all. Howard never puts audience into the emotional journey of reconnection efficiently, and all the efforts feels meaningless.There's a moment when Mamaw is watching a 90s movie, drinking soda and eating mints. Every single brand is precisely turned to the cameras to make people understand that the story is set at that specific time, and entire direction and production is like that. So didactic that hurts.When Owen is in the car, at the phone with Usha, which was one of the few most interesting moments I could find during entire movie, I couldn't stop thinking that the movie should have started from there, and entire story being revealed during this phone talk while he travels.",Hillbilly Elegy
95,koofasa,Amazing film,10,5 December 2020,"This film touched my heart for personal reasons. I could feel the truth in it because I relate to it. The film was beautifully acted, written and directed. Ron Howard and his cast should be very proud of their adaptation of JD Vance's memoir. I've seen the critics pan this movie because of some perceived political reasons. The real reason that the progressives hate this film is because it shows how important family is. Ron Howard came from a well balanced family and produced a beautiful family of his own so of course he didn't see the problem with making a film about family that also focuses a bit in the opioid epidemic. That's definitely not a woke thing to do but I definitely appreciate it and am thankful that there are still a few legit filmmakers in Hollywood.",Hillbilly Elegy
96,samabc-31952,"Superlative performances, efficacious screenwriting but the book wins",7,10 January 2021,"This is a personal memoir of JD Vance, he brings the unique perspective to share on the white working class population or sometimes referred to as hillbillies of Appalachia, their struggles, lifestyle, mindsets, culture .. the book is a beautiful, straight from heart, non-judgmental narrative.. it effectively articulates the cultural divide in Appalachia.
This movie however has received a blow from critics but propitious reviews have surely outnumbered those brickbats .. I have read the book and I feel the screen writer has done a good job stripping away few parts which actually are on the back of the burner..but having said that as it always happens and in this one too .. the book wins ..however, the superlative performances by the A-list actors make this movie a great watch ..",Hillbilly Elegy
97,howboutthisone_huh,too syrupy for my taste,6,28 November 2020,"On the one hand, it's refreshing to see these characters as ordinary people and not privileged as is so popular today but I'm not sure if the intent is to uplift them or perpetuate the stereotypes at the other end. I didn't read the book. I think If I did, I'd understand the title but if the producers did their homework they'd know that the top states and areas of the country where opioids and other drugs are most prevalent would be the northeast, and particularly places like vermont and rhode island, but there aren't any media stereotypes yet so 'vermont hillbilly elegy' probably wouldn't work. In any case, there's enough hillbillies and rednecks in my family tree that I say with some authority this movie is pretty disingenuous. Well, at least for west louisiana and the ozarks. Not the first few minutes. That was like my family reunions growing up, just a lot smaller, but the rest of the movie, not so much. I didn't read the book but it wouldn't take much to be better than this pancake. 'elegy' though is a really apt term in the title considering it's also pretty well ill defined.",Hillbilly Elegy

Its fairly slow and doesn't have any twists and turns which makes things a little stale at times.

100,Golden_Hope,Messy at Times but Fine,6,25 November 2020,"I am pretty confused why all the critics hated this movie so much. Is it the best thing since sliced bread, no absolutely not. But it is completely watchable.I think it falls down with the script and directing. They just have a strange flow sometimes. Some parts are just really odd for lack of a better work. I can't really explain why it didn't work.I think the score stands out. It fits the tone perfectly. I think it could definitely be nominated.The acting is also great with Glenn Close being the obvious stand out. She does steal every scene that she is in and i think the make up department did a fantastic job making her look like the actual Mawma. Watching the home video clips at the end you would swear that it was actually the same person. I do think they leaned in a bit too heavy into the quippy dialogue with Glenn but that is on the writer not her. It was a little bit too sitcom-y at times but most of the time her scenes were the most impactful.Also Haley Bennett was great too. She wasn't a huge focus but i found my self wanting more of her because she was great to watch. She played the role really grounded and earnest i thought she was really good.Sometimes i found this movie to be a bit manic, it kind of tapers off towards the end but at the start it really is like a lot of screaming matches and like just strange choices. I think it hinders Amy Adams because it tends to be scenes that involve her. The more subdued parts work so much better for me.I think it had a lot of heart and i really appreciated the message, would i ever watch it again? No. But it was perfectly fine.",Hillbilly Elegy

The best bit is when he takes control of his young life, understanding that taking personal responsibility can get you far. While intelligence runs very high in this particular hillbilly family, their lives get wrecked time and time again. Managing emotions is tough in the part of the USA deplored by the so-called elite, though there is no politicizing in this authentic tale - just a real life empowering story of how you always have a chance to overcome your inner demons, but you have to try and slay the dragon, no-one is going to do it for you, though a family is a great if sometimes thorny resource. Help is certainly not gonna come from class to which the smug hypocrite critics belong, they know that full well and they deplore the movie all the more for it - and the people it tells the story about. But one can certainly give extra points to the perfectly decent movie (and quite above average for a Netflix production) - and this movie does not pretend to be more than it is, a retelling of an authentic, inspiring story about real problems and how they can be conquered - to counter the horrible, despicable critic panning.",Hillbilly Elegy

104,dale-51649,"Hillbilly goes to Yale, pretentious & fake , reverse snobbery at its worst",2,26 November 2020,"I had read a little about the story and had some interest in the author . I also came from a poor background and went to an Ivy league school. I tried to read the book, but in an early scene it had a little kid chewed out by an adult pharmacist , and the parents come to the rescue. They tell off the adult for correcting the kid.
Classic revisionist history. I lived thru the 60s, and the world was for the adults. If kids got an adult mad , they got it twice as bad from their parents when they got home. Maybe there were examples of the adult sticking up for the kids, but I never saw it.
In the film JD is at a dinner attended by law firm partners where he is applying to work. When one of the men uses the term ""Redneck"" he chews him a new one. Totally embarrassing the man for using the term , telling him how smart his mother is and grinding his nose in using a funny joke term. Not something you would do if you wanted the job.
I saw Trump do the same thing on ""The Apprentice "". A contestant use the term ""white trash"" and trump fired him, even though the guy said he himself was white trash. I wonder if JD knows how much like he is Like Trump? they are both wealthy businessmen , neither who has ever gotten their hands dirty. And yes, rednecks and white trash do in fact joke around using those terms, since they are so ill defined and nebulous that nobody is purely or even mostly either of those two. In other words, those terms are often not used seriously. Everybody knows that not all smart people are educated, only dumb educated people think that.
I think Trump and JD are the same. They both want to embarrass and disarm people by using our changing lexicon . ""gotcha"" !. They use new and changing boundaries , its power. They feel they have more power if they call someone out for using an out of date term, or one they feel is out of date. The hypersensitivity isn't doing us any good.
JD Vance is reportedly a venture capitalist. They are supposed to bring some technical or managerial expertise to companies, and maybe he did. But as far as I know he never saw a patient, built a house, mined any minerals, or did any in the trenches work that the people who suffered that he depicts did. He had a rough childhood, and his mother had an addiction problem. He could have gone to medical school and helped addicts instead of Yale Law and becoming a big ""investor"" , which generally gets as much work out of the rank and file paying them as little as possible to bonus themselves the majority of the take. Is't that the American dream? to become a wealthy ""investor"" and have others do the back breaking work? You can bonus the profits and claim you are laying people off for the shareholders, the perfect scam.",Hillbilly Elegy

106,Rino_Bortone,NO ONE WILL BOYCOTT HILLBILLY ELEGY ANY FURTHER,7,4 December 2020,"Just because some subjects do not deal with themes treated in a certain way, does not mean that the film, taken away from the autobiography, is not valid and well done. Everyone knows Ron Howard for his immense talent, his true or plausible stories, which have enchanted millions and millions of people; Hillbilly Elegy is no exception. Films with a strong, meticulous and not at all listless cast, even if some characters are not a photocopy of the real ones (as they say), there are still characters of interest and that catch. Glenn Close is a love for the eyes and a punch in the stomach for the acting strength he possesses at age 73, meticulous, amazing and brilliant. Amy Adams? More and more convincing, more and more mature, more and more dedicated to her passion and brings to the screen a poignant character, who wants to be more and who struggles in a tough life with no lights. Although, perhaps, as they say, she has not been able to grasp the suffering of the real Bev (something that no one except those who have experienced her can say with some certainty), Amy Adams gives us yet another excellent interpretation of her career. Gabriel Basso could have done more and will certainly do more forward, but he doesn't disappoint too much in representing a young man who not only struggles with himself, but also with the world around him, taking the weight of the world on his shoulder and his world is his family. Finally, in this salad, Ron Howard who, no matter how many mistakes he may have made, manages to bring a story that is powerful and is undeniable. A film is a film, a story is a story, therefore political messages, situations not portrayed accurately, characters distant from the real ones and so on, have nothing to do with a film that if extrapolated from context and taken away from autobiography, it renders like a story written at the table and written with simplicity, without great ambitions.

108,isaacsundaralingam,I don't get the hate,7,27 March 2021,"Let's be clear here. Hillbilly Elegy is a not a 10/10 movie, but neither is it a 26% as given on RT. I read through the negative reviews, and I get why it ""could"" be criticized for certain storytelling and character development elements, which is totally fair btw, but most of them just seemed to give it unfair hostility for reasons that they say are apparent, which I don't see to be the case.Anyway, what makes Hillbilly Elegy a more than decent watch are the two powerhouse performances by both Amy Adams and (especially) Glenn Close who give it their all-out best in their passionate portrayals of the main character's mother and grandmother respectively. They do such a great job of translating the script to screen that they absolutely deserve all the credit they get.My criticism for this movie however, has to do with the way in which it was structured. While I generally love movies that employ non-linear storytelling as a means of adding more dimension to the story they tell, in this it feels somewhat disoriented; as if it wasn't really confident in its own progression. For example, the single scene of Bev lashing out at JD in her car is told in three parts against scenarios that feel misplaced when contrasted to. And so much more even.But looking back overall, what I will reflect on in the future when I think about Hillbilly Elegy isn't the plot or the structure, but the performances by the two leading ladies that are just perfect. I wish for more people to see it to at least appreciate the acting talent on display if not for anything else.Also, the movie's highway poster is one of the most beautiful.",Hillbilly Elegy

She delivers a great performance and so every time she is on screen the movie is actually good. Amy Adams is good as well. Unfortunately Gabriel Basso is not. I try to be more polite in my reviews so I will just say that he is not up for the job at any given moment and sadly he has a lot of screen time.The movie shows a lot of the suffering but fails to talk about the why. We see a glimpse of what happend to Amy Adams in her childhood which is told in less then 2 minutes. So it is hard to feel for her. So the movie juggles between the characters of Basso, Adams and Close never deciding on what the actual story or message is. The last 10 minutes are zappy and predictable and make this all a forgettable experience. There have been many better attempts at these topics usually by smaller studios or independent movies that dare to get more gritty and don't need to serve contrived stories and happy endings.",Hillbilly Elegy

This man's journey is strongly affected by his mother's irresponsible behavior and inability to stop repeating the vicious cycle of victimhood instead ""pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps"". Ultimately, life is about choices and your own courage to overcome personal struggles and the author did just that. But I also must add another important part which is him not rebelling against grandma that really pushed him to succeed because deep down he knew she cared and that was his choice but also he was very lucky to have such imperfect but still positive family influences in his life. And maybe that is the lesson, despite having an imperfect parent or grandparent love can be so strong that if accepted it can have a positive outcome and it is obvious the author is grateful to have grandma in his life which i am grateful to him for writing about it.

114,kevvportela,It could have been a great movie,6,23 March 2021,"It had everything to be an emotional and strong film but it ended up being a poorly told story with good performances.
Director Ron Howard's proposal is not bad but it is not up to the task, based on the novel it leaves many gaps in the story where the reason for certain actions of the characters is not explained.
The first 30 minutes promises a lot but then maintains that rhythm and not slowly but the opposite, everything happens at a very high intensity level that in this case does not help, from those first 30 minutes you already see 100% of the movie so there is no moment of rest and process for things to be ordered and it is not a chaos of sheer screaming and drama.
The script does not favor its characters, the actors did what they could. Starting with Amy Adams, she seemed more crazy than drug addict, Glenn Close gives an emotional performance that manages to put the tone and Gabriel Basso is very well putting the film on his shoulder and being the character with the best development.

It is directed by Ron Howard and embellished with superlative award level performances which are the highlight. The director is helped by a taut and brilliant screenplay which gives the film a realistic and strong narrative. Based on the autobiography of JD Vance, the film set in American countryside of Ohio traces the traumatic ups and downs in the family headed by mamawa Glenn Close who is troubled by her drug addicted married daughter Amy Adams and so takes over bringing up her teenaged grandson when he is tormented by his mom. Both ladies are likely to pick up awards for acting. The film focusses on problems of life as they keep happening to the family mainly due to the misdemeanors of drug addicted Amy.
Glenn Close is superb as the dominating matriarch and is a delight to watch.( There are good terminators, bad terminators and neutral terminators she says) . Amy Adams does equally well as the drug addicted mom who finds it difficult to kick the habit while having a love hate relationship with her mother and son. She has done well in her scenes of drug induced hallucinations and eccentricity. Gabriel Basso plays the grown up JD admirably who has to perform his duty to rehabilitate his mom, pursue his career options ( Yale law degree) and keep his love life alive with his loving Indian girlfriend ( Frieda Pinto ).

She's always 'lost' inside her character; whether a floozy or royal or hillbilly or matriarch, we believe in her. And in Hillbilly Elegy she succeeds once again. So much so that an Oscar (nomination) would not surprise. She is without ego here; allowing herself to grow increasingly overweight and overwrought as the film progresses.So too Glenn Close. The actress loses herself in a cranky, brittle, ferocious, and ferociously caring head of family. We never, even in her most ferocious moments, question the goodness, the caring, lurking just below her angry words.The film, however, is true 'Made For TV'. Despite Ron Howard's best directing effort, this film could exist on Lifetime or Hallmark and feel absolutely at home. There is nothing complex in its story-telling; Present Day - Flashback - Present Day - Flashback, and so on and so on. It is as though every event that happens in present day can be explained-by or was foreshadowed by a like event in the past. This is paint-by-numbers story-telling, at best.",Hillbilly Elegy

Because instead of attacking the insitutions that make Americans want to be rich... They continually attack poor people and show the luxuries of being rich (like they dont have problems)... This is honestly why families like these continually suffer and why they get called names... Tired of Yuppie programming esp. coming from Hollywood asshats who have more problems than regular people.

The acting, for the most part, is heartfelt and achingly artful; Amy Adams and Haley Bennett wear the faded denim, the blue collar eye baggage and the twangy accents well and convincingly. They did the many great actors who were born and reared in Kentucky a true solid (Harry Dean Stanton, Ned Beatty, Jennifer Lawrence, Sean Young, Johnny Depp, Jim Varney, et al.). Their performances were emotionally honest and non-exploitative. Now onto the tragic miscast that is Glenn Close. An actress who was born and reared in ivory tower, uber-aristocratic, highfalutin Greenwich CT. You want to talk about snobby, supercilious critics being out of touch with poor rural America, well Glenn is the antipode of it. I thought her acting in this as mamaw was about as useless as a drum in bluegrass. Forced and affected. It seems clear that she never spent much time around impoverished Kentuckians and was playing a crude caricature of her perception of poor white trash. It struck me as insincere and downright exploitative. One of her worst performances to date. She totally dishonored the memory of good ol' JD's mamaw.

128,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,Oscar Bait 101: The Elegy of the Hillbilly (Hillbilly Elegy),5,6 December 2020,"In a non-pandemic year, late-November/early December would be the sweet spot for releasing films with their eyes on that prize, the Academy Awards. Although theaters are generally still closed, Netflix's prestige picks are coming out weekly, even though the ""awards season"" has been extended into April. Last week, Ron Howard's Hillbilly Elegy premiered with mixed advance buzz and the Oscar hopes of a duo of ""overdue,"" multi-nominated actresses, Amy Adams and Glenn Close, in tow. Award worthiness is subjective - here's how I see it.Based on the memoir by J.D. Vance, Hillbilly Elegy tells the story of J.D., a Yale law student, who is in the middle of interviews for summer associate positions, when he receives word that his mother has overdosed on heroin. J.D. has to go home to his family in Ohio in order to take care of his mother. Through flashbacks on his journey home, we see how J.D. got from his meager beginnings, enduring abuse and his mother's drug addiction to Yale with the fierce, no nonsense support of his grandmother. The perspective of people in Appalachia is not a typical one depicted in films, but family drama can be universal as many people in urban, suburban and rural areas endure hardships, lack of opportunity, addiction and abuse. There is also love, sacrifice and support that fill families across the board. While this story is specific to a people in a specific place and time in America, it feels pretty generic - disappointingly so.Ron Howard does not do anything particularly interesting in directing this film. The only exceptions are the two sequences where we see how this Appalachian area has changed and decayed over the decades. Otherwise, Howard lets the emotions of the story drive the action. And, the emotions are very high.Amy Adams plays J.D.'s mother, Bev. She's mired in drug addiction. She's abusive. She's impulsive with men and clearly has trauma and mental health issues. Adams chews all of the scenery. She plays every angle to the hilt, which becomes a bit much to take.The other pillar in J.D.'s life is Mamaw as played by Glenn Close. Close has the wig and make-up to transform her into the chain-smoking, Terminator loving matriarch. Close moves and speaks in a way that helps her embody the character and attempt to make the ""hillwoman"" more than a caricature. Close is more successful in her portrayal than Adams as she strikes the right tones and gets the inspiring, emotional touches needed to ground the movie. Unfortunately for both Adams and Close, their scene partners who play the teenage and adult J.D. are flat and uninspired, which drags down each of their scenes.In fact, the J.D. character just solidifies how blandly generic Hillbilly Elegy feels. J.D. should not be the main character of the film since he is the least interesting aspect of the story. I can't tell if it is the poor writing of the character or the lackluster performances by Gabriel Basso and Owen Asztalos, as adult and young J.D., respectively, that make him so blah. It's probably failures on both ends - on top of the fact that his arc is in no way compelling.While there is merit to this story, the focus of Hillbilly Elegy is misplaced. Glenn Close makes her scenes emotional and engaging, but the rest of the movie is either over-the-top or bland. It is a worthy experience, but other than Close, I wouldn't say award-worthy.

I haven't read the book, but it's almost like, for the most part, rather than the real life people it depicts, we're seeing caricatures of them. Glenn Close perhaps gets closest to reality, before she goes and kicks the 'bad kids' off the doorstep and thereby magically transforms J. D's life, which should beggar the question, how can that same person have so dramatically failed Bev? It's a bit like an episode of the Jerry Springer show, one can argue these people are in a situation that is nobodys fault but their own, but that ignores the context of what ingredients are needed for a happy life. The dire failings in education, opportunity, housing and support that, hinder rather than prevent J. D from achieveing his aims are all alluded to, but you end up with the impression that it still would have been fairly straightforward for him if his mum hadn't taken drugs.",Hillbilly Elegy

132,pronitmallick,The emotion didn't strike that much,6,25 November 2020,Hillbilly Elegy is a film that starts with a soothing vibe and goes on introducing all the characters. Pacing of the first arc goes smoothly but starts to feel kinda boring after some time. Right at the end of the first arc things start to feels repetitive where the story is just circling around the family drama. The film tries to strike us with all the emotional moments where sometimes it works fine but sometimes it doesn't. Amy Adams delivered a fine performance throughout the whole movie but in the end it wasn't enough to lift up a whole movie. overall it's a film that you can definitely watch for once.,Hillbilly Elegy

The acting was powerful all the way through. It has gripping emotions from start to finish that shows how bad you have to work, and to want something, to succeed when all the cards are stacked against you. Some may find this to be a ""woe is me"" kind of story, but I think it showed the never quitting spirit that Southerners have. Honestly, it's better than the professional critic reviews that I've read.Overall, I really enjoyed the film and the story behind it.

The main diffwrence with the book was that JD's father was a kind and decent person, but he had his own family and JD chose his grandma rather than his father and stepmother and step siblings. It is a portrait of the decay of blue collar America. Once jobs go away, people give up trying to be decent. In the movie (and life) nobody goes to church, nobody cooks a meal (only junk food), nobody exercises or keep their lawns mowed. And it is just a reflect pf their low self esteem.His sister also shows how the easiest escape from oppressife houses is by getting married early, when you move from a broken household to another one.

Amy Adam (Bev) put on an Academy award performance in this film hands down, I was angry at her the entire movie, she portrayed Bev flawlessly. Glenn Close, as Mamaw who helped raise J.D. was almost unrecognizable, she two put on an Academy award performance. Gabriel Basso as J.D. Vance, Academy award performance. The chemistry in this film is so fluent that it tugs at your heart, it's a clean film with no nudity. Ron Howard is still the man anything he touches turns to gold. The story of J.D.

142,severindringel,Just an average movie,5,26 November 2020,"Hillbilly Elegy is a film that actually has everything to offer. Oscar-winning director Ron Howard, a brilliant cast including Amy Adams and Glenn Close and a true family story about a young man who tries to break away from his past but in the end always prioritises his family. Unfortunately, it has become nothing more than a mainstream Hollywood drama that could hardly have been more predictable and bland.Although the flashbacks to the childhood of protagonist J.D. Vance are necessary, in order to understand the core story of the actual plot in the present better. Their constant repetition and lack of chronology can be very confusing and at times exhausting. The story itself is very simple and the movie is much more about the dynamics within the family. The great emotional touch, which in reality is only felt while the credits roll in the end, with photos from real life, is, however, missing. Unfortunately, the performance of our male lead actor is not tangible enough for this. If you can say something positive about Hillbilly Elegy, Adams and Close's performances immediately stand out. They prevent the film from becoming a total flop and both can hope for nominations at award ceremonies with their performances.But that is the main problem of this film: it's oscar bait. Moreover, at almost no time does it let the audience get too close and lacks variety and creativity in directing. So in the end Hillbilly Elegy is not much more than average.",Hillbilly Elegy

Hallmark quality",5,2 December 2020,"I read the book.It was rather repetitive.The movie was slow and boring.A couple of good performances by Glenn Close and whomever Vances mother is. Familys like this are a car wreck.
The solution to a lousy economy and a bad family situation is to leave the area and strike out for greener pastures. Grandma Vance moved to Ohio,but the problems kind of went with her,grandpa. Immigrants still come to the USA for economic reasons and do well. They have far greater roadblocks than the Vance group.
This story is from a ponderous book, trying to explain too much and the movie is based on that. To explain Trumps appeal in 2016 was the hook to get people to read the original book. An explanation of why. This was missing in the movie. It didn't click in the book anyway.
Let me say those who work and aspire will suceed ,the others stay put where they do whatever or nothing. People love to gawk at ""HillBilly"" life, but you can find people like the Vances anywhere in the a USA. Dysfunctional and generational. For a child, it does help to have enuf stability to build a base from which to launch. Vance grandmother did that for him.His mother couldn't. She was injured too much by events in her childhood.

However it stayed on my mind for a few days afterwards and did leave me feeling melancholy and deflated.Maybe i will read the book. Another that had a very similar feeling was The Glass Castle. Those saying it's too much, trashy or heavy with the portrayals of some characters. I say perhaps you have not seen or experienced that same life.I'm an Aussie girl who was a child of the 80's, raised by a single parent, with very little in money or attention. Whilst i may not be in same country, the universal truths are there. I could relate to that mother figure being larger than life and loud. I could relate to the kids who could only shed tears when all else was beyond their control. Who had to grow up without a real childhood to parent an adult and ultimately who sometimes need to cut connections because family may be blood but you still have a choice about toxic relationships for your own success and well being. This is someone's truth and the movie did an excellent job to show as much. I'm always impressed with those who can forgive and find peace as this movie portrayed. I've never had that ability as i don't think all people do deserve redemption but i admire those who can regardless of own opinion.I also see alot comments about privilege on these reviews. Privilege is not only monetary - it's the right to go to sleep feeling safe at night, to know the adult in your life has your best interest at heart and be kept out of harms way. Issues that reach beyond race or gender. There is a lot to take from this movie beyond being a Hollywood production. Glad i did decide to watch it and reflect on the emotions it stirred up. I would watch it again.",Hillbilly Elegy

148,actaction,Critics stuck on anti-Trump stance missed this great film's point,7,26 February 2021,"The critics skewered this one and in their hate for real-life evils of extreme conservatism decided to falsely doom this film. I read reviews by multiple critics at how the film showing one ""straight white man picking him up by his bootstraps"" is ignorant of the reasons many people cannot. I hate this kind of elitism that leads critics to push their own narrative into a film and punish it for something it never was attempting. It's true the film is a ""get the hell outta Dodge"" tale and does paint in broad, sometimes unbelievable strokes; but just because it's about a white hillbilly family dealing and overcoming problems, doesn't mean it is a comment on all people and all situations as somehow lesser or that it's positivity it relates is ignorant of how it doesn't always work in real life. It's a film... it is supposed to suspend disbelief. I haven't read the right wing book it came from, so maybe that's full with trump-era bull, but all I know is the film doesn't have a shred of blame for how crappy life sometimes is but instead shows how some get out of it. I'm glad performances by Glenn Close and Amy Adams are being nominated for awards (of which they deserve), but it bothers me critics use terms for their gritty roles as them being ""uglied up"". Firstly, the actors are made to look very close to how the real people looked, so that's totally insulting; but secondly it's not ""uglying up"" to look real. Sometimes Hollywood is very resistant to show real rawness if it doesn't mean their definition. I really feel the critics missed the boat on this one. It's not the best movie ever, but totally worth watching and more real, true to life than many others films getting lots of attention.

150,Bek204,A decent film but not a masterpiece,7,2 December 2020,"A decent movie with a great acting performance from both Amy Adams & Glenn Close who I won't be surprised if she gets nominated for an Oscar. But, the film had some mistakes that prevented it from being a great motion picture that would be nominated for Best Picture in the Oscars.For those who don't know the movie is based on a true story and to be specific, it's based on a book called ""Hillbilly Elegy"". The story is so emotional and touching, the film was able to express that perfectly. But the problem is that we didn't get to know much in-depth about the characters except for J.D. Vance (played by Gabriel Basso) and the movie is just showing one side of the family which is the bad and negative side. For instance, Bev (Played by Amy Adams), we only saw one side of her which is the negative, bad mother, and addicted side except for one scene only which I cannot mention so I don't spoil anything. I didn't see much in-depth, I only saw what is from the outside.The movie switches through different timelines, the past & present which was perfect because after each scene there was a scene from the past that explains why this specific thing happened in the present. The film was not causing any confusion and the film editing was perfect. The screenplay was okay, didn't find anything that would make it great, it was decent and normal which might be why the film is not a masterpiece.On the other hand, hair & makeup was perfect in the film. The characters looked exactly like the ones in real life especially Bev (Played by Amy Adams) and Mawmaw (played by Glenn Close).The film is dramatic & emotional and the acting performances made them more dramatic but one thing that kind of ruined a part of it was the music score that was annoying because the same music was playing over and over again throughout the film. I felt like there was one specific music that they used for the whole film.Glenn Close's performance was so genuine and amazing, she was able to impersonate that character very very well that I hope she wins an Oscar for her performance in Hillbilly Elegy. For Amy Adams, she was not the problem at all, her performance was incredible. But her character is the problem. Like I mentioned we didn't get to know much about her character and therefore I was not able to sympathize with her except for one scene, and I blame the writers for that because Amy Adams could do better than that but her character didn't let her so.In the end, the movie is not bad and deserves better than that. But this is a fail attempt for the production company which is Netflix to get this movie to the Oscars, I don't think the movie deserves to be nominated for any awards except Glenn Close's performance. The writers were capable of making this film a masterpiece especially that they had a great story in hand, but the result was a decent, dramatic, and emotional film.My rating is 7/10",Hillbilly Elegy

153,theshanecarr,Alright but not right,5,11 May 2021,"I'm having a hard time with Hillbilly Elegy. I could simply say it's got great performances, some affecting scenes, but ultimately conforms to all the feel-good beats you expect of it.But I think the film has a more serious project that I would like to engage with.I read a comment on a NY Times article recently in which the commenter asked why the NY Times was giving us so many articles these days on Trump supporters - asking what the big idea was, saying we know these people are out there, why do you keep telling us?But I think the NY Times is trying to do something worthy. It knows it did not see the 2016 election results coming, and it is making a good faith effort to get ""out there"" in the country more and provide some insight into a slice of the electorate that the stereotypical NY Times reader might not have.I think it's fair to say that's what director Ron Howard, and the rest of the team behind this movie were doing when they adapted this memoir by J. D. Vance. To make a movie that would reflect parts of America not usually seen onscreen, in a way that seeks to understand their viewpoint. And in doing it, to provide insight to their more liberal American citizens.It's a worthy aim, but one done so self-consciously that I couldn't help but be aware of it throughout; ""Look at the poverty! Hear the grit!"" It's distracting.Which is not to say none of it works.The movie is told in two timelines; one with J. D as a child, and one with him as an adult. The scenes with the young J. D. are the stronger half - the sense of his family being adrift in their town where they are separated from their roots is alluded to if under-explored, but the performances are wonderful. Glenn Close has gotten all the attention, and she is great as the indomitable Mamaw, trying to keep everyone on the straight and narrow, but Amy Adams is brilliant too as J. D.s mom. She has scenes where she can be the sweetest thing one moment, and fly into a terrifying rage the next.The adult J. D. timeline is weaker. The condescension of the ""elites"" he mixes with at his university is ladled on fairly thick. Gabriel Basso doesn't quite convince as the adult version of the J. D we see earlier. His girlfriend (played by Freida Pinto) is given nothing to do but make supportive phone calls.And worst of all, the moral of the film, the meaning articulated in a key scene in which J. D makes a defining choice was so morally repugnant to me I couldn't quite believe the film was going to follow through with it.This is the part of the movie I struggle with. To me, the ""there is no such thing as society"" ethos the movie espouses, the ""pull yourself up by your bootstraps and expect nothing from anyone"" is anathema to the way I think people should live. We are a community, and we should help and heal and lift each other up.But maybe that collision of my philosophy with that of others is precisely the point. And maybe it's good to be discomfited now and again.I get that people with problems need to help themselves but the idea that we are all disconnected from one another is shocking. For me, the tragedy is that American healthcare won't help J. D.s family unless they can pay. For the movie, the tragedy is that J. D.s mom can't help herself. I find it cruel. It isn't the decision J. D. makes, it's the celebration of that decision that I find repulsive; like he's finally free of this burdensome family and can get on with being successful.It left me with a very sour taste in my mouth.Your mileage may vary.",Hillbilly Elegy
154,ddelamaide,Gritty film shows America's grim underside,10,6 December 2020,"Who knows why this film about hardscrabble life in Appalachia rates only a 6.7, but I suspect it is political, like everything else in this country. J.D. Vance's original book also came under fierce criticism for being too sympathetic to a class of people generally categorized as deplorable supporters of Donald Trump.In the film, Glenn Close and Amy Adams give Oscar-worthy performances as Vance's grandmother and mother. Rarely has an actress submerged herself so completely in a character as Close, who makes you think you're watching a documentary. Adams is also superb, though her role may be underwritten.It's odd this movie should be viewed as political, given that director Ron Howard is an outspoken liberal. The depiction of boarded-up windows and drug addiction that blights so much of the Midwest is sadly all too true.

155,thinkMovies,Watching the Hillbillies?,7,18 March 2021,"A movie about a segment of Americans that we seldom bother to understand beyond pretentious jokes. It fails to find the humanity and remains a voyeur of caricatures. What is it, in this land of opportunity and American dream, that keeps these communities in ignorance, abject poverty and drugs? Nothing is explained. The causes and reasons are taken for granted, as in... this is the way it is. One young man tries to rise from it, but why? The five minutes or so of watching his grandma trying to save him from his mother are not enough to explain how the sure-to-be dropout ends up pulling himself up to Yale.The performances are another thing altogether. Glenn Close and Amy Adams, in that order, pull award-worthy performances out of their hats. It's worth watching the movie just to experience what those two gave to the film. And, although Adams never gets you to be instinctively on edge about her character, she nevertheless gives an excellent performance, including the attempt to pull a Charlize Theron-in-Monster (2003) visually repulsive body, face and skin (compared to the usual); Glenn Close too.The script hardly touches upon how this family and this community sees outsiders, other races, other classes, except for a couple of phrases spoken by Glenn Close about Native Americans -yet it is a film supposedly about breaking away and upwards. The film goes to great lengths to show stuff, visually, but explains nothing.

Perhaps they didn't like it that the ""white priviledge"" BS was challenged.From someone who grew up white and very poor in a completely dysfunctional family, I related to this movie in a number of ways, one being I was the first person in my immediate family to not only graduate from high school, but from university as well, and all with zero support and encouragement from family.Kudos to Howard for attempting to tell the story, but it did feel a tad bit like it was being told by someone who didn't live the experience.",Hillbilly Elegy

159,jericha-27402,Good Acting Saved This Problematic Tale,6,26 November 2020,"Maybe I'm just being too harsh, but it was really hard for me to have sympathy for JD's mother. Contrary to our initial assumptions, JD's mother wasn't a poor woman who had nothing going for herself. She was smart and educated (was a nurse). She had a decent house from what I could see. Therefore, it's really hard for me to believe that her actions were anything but selfish. Drug addiction is hard to overcome, but JD's mom barely admits she has a problem in the film. This makes her character very unlikeable. In other words, this character has little remorse for her actions. She's a complete narcissist in the film. This woman puts her kids through the most horrible conditions and then blames her upbringing for it.Secondly, I don't understand the point of this film. Family comes first. Okay? Even when one person is abusive and puts their wants before their own children? Frankly, the film kind of sends this message that it's heroic to ""save"" your messed up parents. We are made to believe that's a child's responsibility. I call BS. We shouldn't glamorize JD's situation. That woman was awful and he had no obligation to help her at all. Family values don't apply in cases of abuse. I'm just going to leave it at that.Lastly, this film is completely one dimensional. It almost appears like a big budget Christian film with great acting. I was expecting a little more depth after reading about JD's true story. He is a Yale Law graduate yet the film lacks sophistication. There's no critical thinking required to understand the film's message. It's shallow and sensationalized. Even when it tries to address poverty, everything falls flat. The biggest problem? The writing! The dialogue is very simple and ""I've heard that before"". The bottom line? This film is okay because of the acting.

My parents were these all-knowing all-solving superbeings I could run to when I was a kid for anything and everything. Now I see they had their struggles and pain, but they either didn't let the children know or I was too young to see it, either way I have massive renewed respect for people of all ages now. Also, having that realisation means I have grown as a person in these years, and that makes me happy too.",Hillbilly Elegy
165,Kaygee906,"Great, great movie",10,7 December 2020,"This was such a good movie! The kind that I'm always yearning to watch. It has drama & emotion, but it's not a slow burn. It's kind of a coming of age type of movie and it's not fake. It portrays real life & sometimes in real life there are hard decisions to make. It also has a great message to convey to the audience. I didn't know it was a true story until the end. Overall, it was a phenomenal movie. So much so, that I've watched it 3 times - with different family members. Watch this movie, you won't be disappointed!",Hillbilly Elegy
166,annlevtex,A Rubber Chicken Dinner,5,25 November 2020,"I expected a lot from the book, and was somewhat but not totally disappointed. I wasn't totally disappointed by this either. There are some hard lessons learned by the main character, young JD, who ends up being the most sympathetic in the film, closely followed by his sister Lindsay, well-played by Haley Bennet. In many ways she is the most relatable and real character, the steadfast older sister who has to bear the brunt of her mother's chaos but also manages to escape it in the form of what is sorely lacking for the older Vances.......a stable relationship.This movie tries to have a structure, but it's really just a framework and that ends up being flimsy. Pacing, narrative, structure, character development, motivation, overarching themes, all suffer at the hands of a rather TV-Movie-Ish treatment. And no, I don't mean ""Netflix Film""....I mean TV Movie. It feel rushed and slow at the same time. Amy Adams' wild behavior swings as Bev, the mother, are exhausting and ill-explained. I know from reading the book that they are based in truth, and that in fact it was much worse in many ways than as depicted here. If you are going to make her semi-monstrous, then just go for it. I almost got the sense that Vance, as a co-producer, asked them to dial back on their portrayal of his mother, given that she is now six years sober. And that's admirable, but it leaves me not quite knowing how to feel about her character.The acting is good. When it appears to be less than good, I honestly fault the directing. Ron Howard is a good director, but not for this movie. At least not now. He seems unsure of what he is trying to achieve. He tends towards the wholesome, but there is nothing wholesome about what is happening here. That Vance managed to pull himself out of his situation, succeed professionally and personally, is an anomaly. And that's fine, but it doesn't feel quite earned enough at the end. We don't know who the protagonist is. Is it the family? After all, it's ""All that's worth a God damn."" Maybe, but that is not conveyed clearly enough.As a former law student and lawyer myself, I found at least one thing odd. Vance is a student at Yale Law, one of the top three law schools in the country. Yet it appears that he might not be desirable as a summer intern because.....he is not on the Law Journal and doesn't know which fork to use? Utterly unrealistic. You don't have to be on the Journal or Law Review to get a summer clerkship if you go to freaking Yale Law School. And the fact that he is a former Marine from a state school would not have been a strike against him. When he tells the people at the dinner he attends that he was in Iraq, no one seems impressed or thanks him for his service. Sorry, but not even lawyers from top firms are that snobby and out of touch. It's a pretty minor quibble I guess but since this movie is about culture and fish out of water stuff, they could at least get it right.",Hillbilly Elegy
167,OlgaGorelik,Glenn Close blew my mind and broke my heart,9,4 April 2021,"You ride your bike on a dirt road, find a live turtle, plunge into a murky pond. It's a sunny summer day and the place may seem like paradise to a child on too brief of a visit. To his grandparents though it's a place they escaped from with nothing but a few suitcases. Years later that boy's girlfriend will make a striking observation, likening his grandparents escaping rural Kentucky with her father's leaving India for the US. Escape, whether a place or circumstances or both, is one of the themes that run through Hillbilly Elegy. Another one is family responsibility, particularly when traditional roles falter. Should a teenager pee in a cup to help his drug addicted mother keep her job? Should he, now a law student up to his ears in debt, miss a huge job opportunity to take care of her when she won't do anything, anything at all to take care of herself? The answers are not simple and I loved the way the movie dealt with these situations.Hillbilly Elegy is based on a memoir and like many such movies it is told in two parallel narratives, one of which is in flashbacks. The two storylines intertwine, and while they don't necessarily inform each other, there's a subtle thematic echo. Their climaxes are connected in a highly satisfying manner.Owen Asztalos and Gabriel Basso are highly effective as the protagonist J. D. Vance in his teens and twenties respectively. Amy Adams expertly strikes a balance between being likable, pitiful, and repulsive as his mother. But it's Glenn Close who ultimately made the movie so enjoyable as the grandmother trying to hold the family together. I've never seen her like that before. She blew my mind and broke my heart.",Hillbilly Elegy

The book subtley condemns poor folks for being lazy and unwilling to engage personal agency to rise above, while depicting hill people as uneducated, lazy drug addicts. No wonder the elites loved the book! It fits their idea of how ""the other classes"" live. On the other hand the movie accurately depicts a family's struggle with myriad problems without being politically biased.

173,Jac23443,Solid Movie...,8,25 November 2020,"I honestly do not understand the harsh reviews, I watched this movie with low expectations because of what I'd read before going into it but I thought it was fantastic! I don't doubt this will get Amy Adams or Glenn Close a nomination for film awards, at the very least. This movie is definitely emotional and the performances will linger with you after you finish because it is vulnerability and it is weakness, and redemption, and perseverance, and helplessness all at once. Amy Adams is this whirlwind of drama that proves hostile to her family while she struggles with her drug addictions, her son having to cope with the lack of both parental figures with only his grandmother to be his guide and savior throughout his childhood. This movie really kind of gave a window into what addiction does to a person who neither can afford help, or is looking for it, and how complicated life can become. There were so many moments throughout the movie that could have forced Amy Adams' character to confront herself by letting her reap the consequences of her recklessness. But her family behaved like this cushion or a doormat, or a crutch for her misdeeds and drug addictions and the badness would become a cycle, a trend almost, an expected high with a certain inevitable low.There is one particular moment that really got to me, and it was the scene where Glenn Close (Mamaw) is begging a meals on wheels worker to give her more food because she is now taking care of her grandson; a meal for one is split for two and she doesn't think twice about giving her grandson the larger portion of the meal. This just really got to me because although this young man's life was nowhere near perfect, he had someone in his life who pushed him to go further and to try harder and this scene and what happens afterward is probably my favorite thing about this movie.",Hillbilly Elegy

A feel-good tale that teaches you that no matter your background, if you strive hard enough, write your homework, get good grades, and be a good boy, you will finally succeed... To be hired by a big company :DAnd to make everything nice and overcomable, people's motivations are just sketched; substance abuse and domestic violence are so heavily silver-lined that it starts to feel like you are watching a romcom. Yeah, yeah, bad things exist, but you just have to get grip of yourself. Whoever tells you this, is not your friend, they are not looking to uplift you or inspire you, they are just bragging how ""good"" they did. And that's exactly what J.D. here is doing.

There are people in the Appalachia mountain range that unfortunately live a life of such poverty it is humbling. Even people who live with inner city poverty have access to some form of medical care, education, and even more basics of running water and electricity. The ""hill"" people are so downtrodden that those basic amenities are so foreign to them it is truly eye opening to the levels of poverty right within americas most beautiful mountains. Coupled with mental illness, constant instability, lack of education, lack of employment or other opportunities and with drug addiction in the mix it truly creates a sad situation for those involved and this movie could've done a little more to represent those effected.

The Flashbacks to the main character's teen years clearly are the scenes that stand out in the Movie. Some of the Plot seems forced on the viewer and I did not feel for the characters much or care what happed to them. I blame Ron Howard direction for this fault.

Glenn Close and Amy Adams deliver spectacular performances.Gabriel Bosso (Super 8) is also fantastic.There are so many parts of this film that truly are sad, troubling, moving, funny, and challenging to watch. I am fine with all of the elements of the film. However:1. Poorly directed
2. Poorly written with plot holes everywhere
3. No backstory on the Amy Adams character and she is the lead in the film.4. Read up on J. D.'s backstory as his belief is that he worked extremely hard (and he did) and there is no reason other people from his background can do the same. So this is an ego story for him without all of the facts. Thus the film is based on some facts.5. J. D. had a grandmother who saved him from his mother and pushed him hard. So he had strict support and worked extremely hard because of that support.6. He is depicted as a saint and his friends as white trash losers.

This one meanders way too much. The timeline flashback tricks were largely clunky and ineffective. What's missing here were some scenes of genuine joy. Yes poor people from Appalachia can actually get together and have a good time. The family reunion that starts the film should have been longer and showed the real family bonds in good times. The film portrays these people as joyless hicks and that's a disservice to the people.I grew up in Ohio and went to college in Southern Ohio near the location of the film. I later had a very close friend who's life has in many ways mirrored JD Vance's. I read the book when it came out. And found it a bit myopic as the resulting film is.It seems the director constrained the editor from making this a better film. Because the raw material here could be so much better. Or the studio stepped in. Or the editor just wasn't visionary enough.Really good performances fill this film. They do the best they can with the one note script they're given.

There isn't anything more in the movie that I like.The camera is going every where most of the times and the film editing is even worse. The film has no structure to the camera work.The music is good. Hans Zimmer and David Fleming made the best score as they could. There's this scene in the end when the son and the mother has there confrontation in the motel, that one gets me.Ron Howard didn't make any Forrest Gumpish movie, but there are elements that will make this a Ron Howard movie.The movie has moments but the whole plot of the movie was to make it a different kind family movie, not an Oscar winner movie.",Hillbilly Elegy

But movies can tell stories that both inform and inspire. 1st is the acting which is just awesome. When you watch the trailer at the end, you see the pics of the characters portrayed in the movie and recognise what Glenn Close and Amy Irving put themselves through to make this movie. Both actors deliver the goods. Worth seeing for that as well as all the others. 2nd, uniformly amazing setting(s), atmosphere and re-created reality.

It seems fairly obvious that all the cast members put on additional weight, and ""let themselves go"", maybe too many baloney sandwiches, in order to look the part, and I hate seeing one of film's most beautiful women in that condition. ""uglied up"" as it were, like Charlize Theron in Monster, and DeNiro in Raging Bull. And I wish that Amy would quit smoking. Ron Howard rarely disappoints, and this is a good film, but I just couldn't warm up to the characters, or get past the distractions of seeing everyone hill- billied up for their roles. Amy has clearly embraced her age, and transitioned into roles that are age appropriate for her, but this, at least for me, was too much too soon. Glenn, on the other hand, looks perfectly at home inhabiting the role of an old lady. She is, after all, 74 now, and has been down the road. Amy's outing in Sharp Objects, that I saw recently, was one of her best roles, and highly recommended. This one was good, but not great. They all can't be Apollo 13.",Hillbilly Elegy

The performances by Glenn Close, Amy Adams were brilliant along with the performances of a superior supporting cast.This is far from the Beverley Hillbillies sitcom mentality nor is it close to the dramatic series of The Waltons. This film gives insight into the often mercurial red state mentality especially the so called Hillbilly or Appalachian culture.Since I come from a decidedly blue state I have often joked about people from that neck of the woods who are decidedly different from me but, truly, they are not just stereotypes and have important psychological rationales as to who they are and why they harbor the values that they do. Things are often not black or white but shades of grey.If we can try to understand cultures different from ourselves perhaps we could gain some new understanding of and insight into our nation getting to that illusive United States of America. As President Obama once said -- We are not the red states of America we are not the blue states of America but we are the United States of America.

233,timmyminh,Amy Adams & Glenn Close - I smell an Academy Award nomination,8,9 December 2020,"Okay I'm not gonna even bother reading the reviews after seeing it's 6.7/10 (maybe it shall increase in a month and I hope it does), they're just going to be a lot of hates or whatnot which only going to serve to disturb by love and enjoyment for this film. So I'm just gonna say how much I love this picture.Hillbilly Elegy is about family and I guess a lot of people can relate to the struggles of these characters. At times you feel like all of our characters' psychology are both right and wrong at the same time. That's a generational thing... the young can't see the struggles of the old and the history behind their aggravating psychological build-up; and the old carrying baggages of their past and whilst intimidating in their behaviors and mannerism towards the young, they still have a deeper and well-meaning intent - all they hope is for their successive generations to be better. All of the characters can easily relate to us the audience - the embarrassed son of an eccentric and crazed mother; the loving grandmother who's harsh but cares so abundantly for her grandson. The film also features the beauty of the hill people's sense of community, I don't know if it's a subtle intention by Ron Howard but it suddenly feels like a small tribute to that culture for me. And I guess I'd have a soft-spot for this film because of the grandmother and how much she reminds me of mine... and that hits really close to home.Overall, fantastic work by Ron Howard, another hats-off to you, sir. And oh but of course, Amy Adams and Glenn Close... these ladies are getting two easy tickets to the Oscar next year. They both disappeared completely in their roles and there wasn't one moment where I saw Amy Adams or Glenn Close but only Beverly and Mamaw. Their performances were FANTASTICAL. Makes me want to point and say ""now that's what I call acting"". Both Amy and Glenn have been so overlooked by the Academy for years and hopefully this film and performances do them justice.",Hillbilly Elegy

The story was really not that interesting. Kid had a fairly insecure childhood and got out because he was smart and dedicated, and had someone to push him a little. It's a story that's been told a million times and usually the challenges for the protagonist are far greater. I thought the scenes with the 'elites' were a bit far fetched. Smirking condescendingly when the guy says he's from Appalachia. Most people are simply not that socially rude. But anyway, fits the narrative I suppose.

But there just so much you can do with a bad script, and Amy Adams and Glenn Close were given such bad lines, it should be ilegal to write this bad to such great actors.I understand that the point is to portray an ""american dream"" type story, of resiliency and overcoming the odds, but I just don't buy it compared to other Oscar nominees (for example). It's simply boring as hell.The constant flashbacks and flashforwards are so bad, at one point they just quit and made a horrible transition in the middle of the movie that looked like a school project.Also.

This is a really important blueprint and story of how families and extended families really need to step up and stop parents bullying their children. I think the uniqueness of this is that in real life you have to be incredibly brave to stand up to bullying parent who bullies their own child.

240,tyelder,An Uplifting Reminder of Perseverance,10,10 November 2021,"It's been one hell of a year, to put it lightly. With all the hardships, struggles, anxiety, worries, and doubts-Hillbilly Elegy sheds light on the fact that we all just need to keep moving forward if we want to make it.Ron Howard, the acclaimed director, has brought to life the true story of J. D. Vance's upbringing in rural America. Based on his memoir, this film brings family issues to the forefront in raw scenes that are honestly told. Amy Adams and Glenn Close are the stand-outs with such real performances that you forget about any other role they've done. Of course, they may not get nominated for their excellent portrayals because of the waves of ridiculous prejudice toward the film.I had heard this movie had gotten poor critical reviews, but after watching for myself, I can't see how anyone could hate it. There is just too much hatred and stigma toward people who live on the outskirts of American cities, many of whom are struggling to get by or rise up. This is a true story of perseverance and achieving the American Dream, no matter what family or background you came from. I was even pleasantly surprised at the end of it when it was revealed to be a true story. It's a film cast aside by so many uppity critics who have their heads in the sand and only saw what they wanted to see.This is a movie about the cold hard truth about sacrificing for your family and learning to know when it's time to leave for your own good. So many thoughts of my personal life with my family, issues I'm going through, and feelings I'm wrestling with were brought up throughout my viewing. Only the best films can strike you on such a personal chord-such as the extraordinary Just Mercy released at the beginning of this year. You can't fight the emotions; you just have to learn to let go-like another excellent film released recently, Let Him Go. We have to be reminded sometimes, as this movie does, to stop worrying and pouting and bitchin' and moanin'-and just keep moving forward.Hillbilly Elegy is a simple story of a boy learning how the world around him works and how to escape the cyclical trappings that his family has been stuck in for generations. The boy, like so many of us, has been given a chance only because of the love and support of his grandmother, his sister, and later on, his girlfriend. Sometimes we are the boy-being grateful as we look back at the support we have received-and sometimes we need to be 'Mawmaw'-making sacrifices for those we love. This remarkable film brought all these thoughts to the limelight, and that's why I think it needs to be seen, now more than ever.You can choose to take your own path; don't let someone else choose it for you.-TE (12.9.20)",Hillbilly Elegy
241,grashleigh,Read the book,9,7 December 2020,Having read the book I was anxious to see the movie adaptation and happy Ron Howard took on the task to direct .

Life is not easy coming from that background. Wake up or read a little more .,Hillbilly Elegy
242,Digital_excitation,Praise yourself lucky if you haven't had that hardship in your past,8,15 December 2020,"If you are someone who hasn't had a childhood like that, with low income, alcohol or drug abuse or parents that fought all the time and being bullied by everyone, you must consider yourself very lucky. If you are someone who has been through a similar time, worked your way out of that environment and into a better life, you should cherish that achievement and never let anyone take that away from you.The story tells that of a fairly average (depending on your point of view) low income Kentucky family, told by one of the grandchildren. It shows the familiar circle: Grandpa was an mean alcoholic, grandma fought him off regularly. Her daughter wasn't strong enough to break the cycle, even though she was the second smartest student of her school, and got a medical license. She became used to numbing pills, lost her job and spiraled downwards, taking the storyteller (her son) and his sister along in the fall. Grandma took over, he was going to live with her and she would set him straight: Man up, get rid of the loser friends, study hard and work your way up. When he does and goes off to Yale, he makes the hard choice of leaving his addicted mom, achieve his goals so he could return later and be in a better position to help her.A lot of the things that happen in this movie is the story of many out there. Unable to actually achieve and live that American dream that everyone talks about since childhood and is advertised on TV and billboards, becoming sad and eventually getting depressed and seek solace in alcohol or drugs instead of accepting simple fate.Actors and acting is of exceptional quality, where you can just feel the tension and stress at times. All scenes have been very carefully scripted and directed.I'm somewhat biased about this movie though, grandma (you see her at the end credits) looked quite similar to my mom's aunt Dina, we stayed with her for a week when we visited the U.S. 20 years ago, she lived in a similar house, similar conditions, similar family, just a few steps higher up the economic ladder and with far less hardship.

Living and teaching in an area similar to where J.D. comes from, I see his struggle of trying to escape poverty through education and the impact of drug abuse on communities on a regular basis.

But what this movie lacks in subtly and tactfulness it makes up for in sincerity and raw emotional power. In order to enjoy this film you may have to turn off your critical eye - although, Adams' and Close' performances deserve Oscar attention - and just accept the messages and ideas being presented to you; regardless of how much you relate to the exact story that is being represented you will resonate with at least one or two moments in this movie.This movie is about the moment you realize that your family isn't perfect and the choices that follow.

However. The movie also follows a storyline that's been used a lot before. There are no surprises, and all the way through the movie I knew exactly how it was going to play out, because it follows the same script as any other movie about this subject. It would fit perfectly in a dramaturgical model. Glenn Close was really great though - and Amy Adams extraordinary. For their performances alone it's worth a watch.",Hillbilly Elegy

Ron Howard digs into the forgotten dregs of Appalachian society and holds a mirror to the socioeconomic realities of an unnurturing environment and the fortitude, faith, and blind ""luck"" which is required to pull oneself out of a seemingly hopeless situation. Glenn Close--in a monumental role as a fierce, yet vulnerable matriarch--is no less than exceptional as a woman trying to raise her grandson to a better life. Amy Adams shows yet again what a dependable star she in the Hollywood constellation.

They hate it because it depicts the American dream. That's too bad. This is an inspirational story for all who feel stuck in poverty, addiction and hopelessness. Glenn Close is absolutely incredible and Amy Adams plays against type. These are flawed, unvarnished people who survive by the skin of their teeth.

A look on the surface of his rather dysfunctional clan and some will be quick to judge them/the movie on the surface.Hillbilly Elegy offers a deeper look, vis-à-vis the ending, as to how family drama and an ounce of real caring from one or two individuals along the way can make all the difference one needs to find themselves a better life.",Hillbilly Elegy

J.D. is called back to his humble hometown in Ohio when his mother, Bev, suffers a setback in her life. Throughout the film we see how Bev's influence on her family has stunted her own life, put her children frequently at risk, and extended her own mother's matriarchal duties. Faced with the unlikelihood that his mother will ever change, J.D. must decide how much he must sacrifice in his own life in order to perpetuate hers.",Hillbilly Elegy

1) the main character is a Republican , therefore everything he does is inherently bad
2) The timing of the movie distracts people from what should be their main attention at the moment i. E.

Great acting from all the leads, should be some nominations here, but also form some of the younger actors as well.

I was gratified to hear he was pleased with the treatment that Howard gave his material (Vance was executive producer after all, and very involved but still, you never know what these Hollywood types might do) and he especially praised Glenn Close's portrayal of Mamaw. He said she conferred with the family to make sure she got not just the look, but the mannerisms right, right down to the way she held her cigarette.I had read the book a couple of years ago and was very impressed with it but usually am disappointed in film adaptations. Not this time. Sure, it doesn't portray the entire scope of the book, it can't. It would have to be a 10 part series at least to do that.

Aside from the mother's drug problem, I had basically the same life story as his, and it was nearly impossible to hold back the tears throughout so many moments I could see myself and my own life on screen. I also had no idea it was based on a true story, so by the end credits I was just a complete ugly crying mess. The performances were amazing, the whole 90's ambiance was on point, the script and the way those lives were portrayed could not have been anymore realistic.

What I wanted to say was this is a hard movie to watch. It's hard bc it's honest. We all have our struggles and this is another depiction of an honest struggle families have. In America we like to place labels. In this case the labels are hillbilly, red neck, or white trash. It's all true, but it doesn't mean that's bad. It means it's honest. It makes me think of other honest movies about American families like Crooklyn, Ordinary People or Kramer vs Kramer.
In this year of 2020 the word struggle comes up time and again, but let's not forget another truly American symbolic word .... perseverance. Watch this movie and know that if you're down and feel like the world is against you just keep fighting and persevere. I hope this movie can inspire that feeling. It did for me.",Hillbilly Elegy

Mamaw left KY when she was 13!The only plot in the whole movie was about a character I didn't find likeable, going to an extreme to do something his sister could easily have done. The whole trip was senseless.It was like the author wanted to show us that he had an unstable mother but thanks to his sister and Mamaw he managed to keep his life on track.

The screenplay, characters, and basic direction is straightforward and down the middle: there are no surprises, little that's especially creative or unique. In and of itself, this isn't necessarily a bad thing when telling a story: some stories are just honest portrayals of life, and life is incredibly straightforward. Unfortunately, this doesn't strike as a particularly unblinking look at the hard lives of a family from a hard place, either. Some of the situations and characters ring false and some of the acting is far too heavy-handed to feel like reality. It just feels a bit lifeless, if not specifically dull. That would be a clever Hemmingway-kind of device to comment on the banality of this world, but it obviously wants to rise above it; it just can't.If you're not expecting much and you're not looking too closely at the strings, it's (I hesitate to say ""enjoyable"") very ""serviceable"", but if you expect more from such lauded figures of the movie business, it's not here.",Hillbilly Elegy

They were also very loving and open people who'd give you the shirt off their back. This movie captured what I know about some of those areas. It's not pretty at times, but a more simple and honest life. In our society people are conditioned to think the only disadvantaged people are black or illegal immigrants.

Only ten years ago this film would have been highly praised and the actors given numerous awards. But times have changed. There's no way a movie about the addiction and poverty among white rednecks would attract critics' sympathy now. Some of the critics gave their bias away by specifically comparing the characters to Trump voters. To depict ""beneficiaries of white privilege"" as living in poverty can't be allowed. When I read that JD Vance was a Republican, their animosity became even more clear, because after all everyone knows that conservatives are evil and deserve to be cancelled. The fact that the grandmother displayed sacrificial love in giving more than half of her Meals-on-Wheels meal to her grandson, wouldn't sit well with feminists who have raised selfishness to a virtue. Vance's reaction in changing his behavior, working hard, doing his homework, and seeing the results in improving grades reminds me of Ben Carson's story of moving from the bottom of the class to the top, when his mother insisted he do his homework and stop watching television and to read books. Liberals absolutely hate the notion that individual choices and actions can result in change for the better.

But what bothered me the most was that the only really good actor in the whole movie was Glenn Close.

324,ModelOfBravery,Hard to watch,3,24 November 2020,"I fast-forwarded through most of it. The film needs a safe word so you can bail, so it doesn't trigger a panic attack. It's well-made educational entertainment film for the posh set of society. I'd say it was over-acted, but instead, it's spot-on how touchy those folks are, for a reason: they're angry-born angry-grown angry. It's the anger that either motivates or disables. Over-the-top visual abuse (even in the form of tough love), folks with no boundaries, most foul-mouthed, vile-acting, cons, grifters, liars, and all this is within the family--in hopes to get you beyond the family. The film is trigger-familiar, so be careful, for anyone who remotely grew up in a ""hillbilly"" or ""redneck"" environment. It won't be much fun for them. It's kind of like a train-wreck in that you want to see if the man makes it out alive to break the chain of cycling abuse. Respect yourself enough to walk away from anything or anyone who no longer serves you, grows you, or makes you happy. I'm stumped he returned. I don't buy into the 'family' is everything.

326,anandakrishnan137,The movie stays with you a for a while,8,28 February 2021,"Let's start with positives,
First thing, the cast and their performance. The movie is based on real life people and incidents. They shows the real people photos and videos towards the end and it blown me way. How perfect is the casting. But I can't ignore their performance, top notch. Amy adams as always, amazing. Glenn Close as Mamaw was awesome, she made me wish to have a grandma like her. Haley Bennett never disappoint us. Finally Gabriel Basso, i really liked his subtle but powerful acting skills and Owen Asztalos shined as young JD. The rest of the cast all performed well.
Second positive is the technical side. Background score, cinematography, the color tone you name it, it all blends really awesome.
Third positive is whole feel of the movie. A good feel family drama. If you have downs then I would recommend watch this movie. ""It goes with your pain and then take you to a different space where it will open up opportunities for you.""
The negatives are, it's kind of slow, but for a family drama what do you expect. It's not MCU or any fast paced movie. Also you may feel unreal for many parts. But trust me it's real for many. Despite some small cliche moments and this drama pace it's really a worth watch movie. I definitely recommend this one.",Hillbilly Elegy

331,beaglepilot2003,Good movie but grim almost to the end,7,3 December 2020,"In many ways this story could have taken place in any poor section of the United States regardless of geography, culture or skin tone. It's a story about Americans lacking both job opportunities and education, resulting ignorance and poverty plus untreated mental illnesses. Drug use is often a result of these things. It's also a story about family and family helping family.One reason why the movie is probably rated less than stellar is due to it's dark nature. It's gritty and frustrating to see human lives needlessly wasted. The brightest part of the entire movie is, literally, the last two minutes before the credits roll.Another reason is that turning any great book, which often takes 5-8 hours to read, into a two hour movie is going to tick off anyone who read the book. I first experienced this after reading Paul Gallico's excellent adventure novel ""The Poseidon Adventure"" then seeing the movie a couple years later. Although the movie is rated 7.1 on IMDB, I was disappointed for the simple reason movies can never live up to a book. Yes, including the Lord of the Rings trilogy.Critics whining about the movie have similar complaints, that the movie doesn't live up to the book or harping that extra time should have been spent on one thing over another. An example is Bev (J.D. Vance's mother) obvious mental illness (my guess is bipolarism), her inability to receive adequate treatment and her continual relapses into ever worsening drug addictions as a probable cause from untreated mental illness.As others mentioned, it would take a mini-series to fully tell this story. As it is, the movie is well worth watching on its own merits.",Hillbilly Elegy

I went and bought the book within and hour after seeing this movie.

In semi-urban steel town, even the grandmother left the Hills. I grew up in Vermont, and I had relatives that were of the Hills, but I was in a factory town myself. But now live in a steel town near Buffalo NY... this movie truly portrayed the people I have seen around me all my life. Where do the critics come from?

Now, I do understand this is based on an actual story - but actual people have multiple layers to be explored and I feel like this movie does a terrible job at showcasing these nuances. The mother, for example, only brought me anger and even when it was revealed ""why"" she is the way that she is - I still felt anger.This movie tries way too hard to be a drama and it's approach is showing a bunch of times where the mother harmed the main character and it doesn't bother to show it in such way where it doesn't feel like a caricature.This movie would've benefited more in slowly showing the generational trauma of the family and actually exploring in which ways their environment shaped them - such as what I heard was what the book was TRYING to convey. But it failed. It barely had moments where I could see the environment taking a part of their mistakes - all I saw was a dysfunctional family with little to none resolution by the end.

343,luisponz,People remember their lives however they want to do it.,7,29 November 2020,"Although not a great film, it still manages to tell the personal story of J.D. Vance's as he reported it to be. In the book, he goes through a personal journey of survival, enlightenment and perseverance pays for him.
The movie doesn't do a good job in telling the story, or representing J.D.'s character. He seems detached from his own personal accounts. The heart of the story is his relationship with his Mamaw but it gets constantly interrupted by Beverly's drama which although influential, it doesn't have the same weight in J.D.'s outcome as his relationship with Mamaw.
The flashback device didn't work, it should ave been linear.

344,emilio-7-298172,The critics got this one wrong,8,27 November 2020,"Everything I heard about this film was negative. ""A dumpster fire,"" said one film credit. ""I watched it, so you don't have to,"" said another. It's a good thing I didn't listen to that nonsense. This Ron Howard film ranks right up there with his best work.I can only surmise that the criticism of the film was political. Author J.D. Vance, who wrote the memoir for which the film is based, is a right-wing media darling. Ron Howard, the director, has made no effort to hide his anti-Trump sentiments. Any attempt to try and tie this film to the political landscape misses the point entirely. This film is a snapshot of one family and their individual struggles, while also touching on other themes such as family, poverty, drug addiction, health insurance, job loss, education, opportunity, and a host of other relevant topics.Having read a few of the negative reviews, I didn't have high hopes. I was looking for caricatures, overacting, and stereotypes. None of those appeared. What I saw instead was a realistic depiction of rural life that is recognizable to millions of people. I didn't see any political viewpoints because the film was not about politics.For every critic who complained about Glen Close's performance, I say watch the end credits where there is home video of the real person she portrayed. The same is true for Amy Adams. Was her performance over the top? Not if you look at it from the viewpoint of a drug-addicted mother who became a parent at the age of eighteen.While all the actors did excellent work, the two actors who portrayed J.D. Vance, Gabriel Basso and Owen Asztalos, were outstanding. The two performances blended into one.If there were one scene that felt out of place, it would be the scene where Glen Close sets her husband on fire. It was a flashback scene, but there wasn't anything leading up to it that would leave you to believe that the mild-mannered man seen throughout the film was capable of instigating such a response.This is one time where the critics got it wrong.",Hillbilly Elegy

It's sad that it's so complicated to analyze the pure numbers here, but I don't imagine there is any way to fix that. The left hates pro religion, pro military, and pro uplifting movies, whereas conservatives tend to appreciate those themes.

I don't know if the problem stems from the lack of usable material, or from the editor's experience being limited to the sausage factory that is second rate tv series, but the editing was appalling. No place was allowed for characters to breathe and grow, and for a tale about one's origins, there was an unforgivable backstory deficiency. The little given was stingily spread. Just enough to give us some understanding of the basics, when it called for a generosity that would've undeniably pulled us in, giving us no other choice but to be emotionally engaged. Instead we got an inorganic pace constantly reminding us of our observer status. The whole movie editing alternating between a painful rudimental formula and clumsy attempts to deconstruct the narrative to try to match the main character's internal discourse and memories. The final product is a frustrating mishmash revealing an absence of direction and vision. I'm really curious of what was left on the editing room floor. It's one of those film where you can't help but wonder if there is a gem hiding in there. One which could be revealed if it was cut by someone with talent.",Hillbilly Elegy

Obviously the writing was good - the memoir and then the script for the movie. All the actresses and actors are doing a terrific job. So the movie in itself - very good.The problem is, that you can't separate the movie from the person, Vance. He is a predator, the memoir's use is propaganda. Vance turned republican, he worked for Thiel and his wife is also up there with her job at supreme court. They are the people coming from the bottom of society, then pulling up the ladder and serving themselves and only themselves while pretending that everyone can do it, even if it's hard, without help from society. It's basically a lie to keep those people in that area voting republican believing, he is one of them, he made it, they can too. It's saying, ""Look, I'm truthful here, so my politics and the republican party, including Trump of course, are truthful. It's a big lie.At least he tackeled the problem of false believes and racism a little bit, when he let his grandma say serveral times that ""family is everything"" while clearly it's what caused a lot of the problems (violent men) and not willing or being able to turn to the institutions for help.

I love that the story is true and by the scroll at the end , everyone is doing as well as can be expected. Forget everything you've ever thought about Glenn Close. Her turn as ragged, chain smoking, run-hard-and-put-away-wet, long suffering old lady is spectacular.
For those of you who expect this to be some sort of documentary and peering into a hidden culture of stereotyped hillbillies, inbreeds, and moonshiners; you'll be sorely disappointed.

This film was relentless, checking off all the boxes in the bland, colorless, melodrama catalog.Dryness is perfect word to describe the screenplay. There wasn't a single point where I was genuinely engaged or interested in the story, And all the characters just played the same. I always wonder the audacity of a person when writing these types of scripts. As if they're completely detached from the emotional potential of a good script. However The script isn't the only thing I have problems with.I legitimately don't know whether to blame the director for what happened on screen 'cause, he was probably asleep the whole production. There are so many scenes where I was laughing at a supposed emotionally tense scene. Emotions are so poorly conveyed that I was surprised on how emotionally detached I was. Really this films existence really wasn't necessary. do yourself a favor and never watch it.I honestly don't know whether this review was worth writing.

I can separate a book from its film adaptation and judge it on its own merits even if it departs from the book. This adaptation just felt very hollow and empty. The score I gave it was due to the performances and cinematography.",Hillbilly Elegy

372,cyamo,Brilliant adaptation of the memoir,8,25 November 2020,"J.D. Vance unspools a complicated family history in his memoir and many of the episodes were so over-the-top crazy, it's obvious that there was a bounty of dramatic material. The film deftly weaves together these generational stories, past and present, into a powerful narrative of faith, love, and redemption - with a whole lot of enabling going on as well. In his book, Vance does an in-depth analysis of the history and mentality of the Hill People, his people. He talks about their good qualities (fierce loyalty to family) and their negative characteristics (the violent destruction of their families wrought by bad life choices.) In the film, we see how the plague of early pregnancies, dropping out of school, low expectations, and, especially, substance abuse, undermines the fate of individuals and their communities. And those who spout ""white privilege"" sure aren't talking about these folks, who share many of the same problems as inner-city minorities.
The film itself is masterfully done, but would we expect less of a Ron Howard production starring Glenn Close and Amy Adams? The rest of the cast is also first-rate. An important American story well-told.",Hillbilly Elegy

376,busybeee2477-757-772018,An excellent film!,10,22 February 2021,"While this film was very sad, it also was very hopeful. l don't normally watch films with so many cuss words; however, this film depicts how a real family that is struggling lives. It didn't sugar coat it. It showed the love, hope, and hurt that families endure when a parent is abusive or has addiction issues (and may also come from an abusive background). It shows the grace that families will give one another because of their love for each other. That acting was superb!! Every character drew you in to their roles as if they were living it. I loved Glen Close as Mamaw. She was amazing. I love Amy Adams. Her beautiful smile lights up the screen and yet she was able to portray a darker, out of control, character so well. Both of the young men that played J.D. (Owen Asztalos & Gabriel Basso) portrayed their roles so well. You wanted to root for them to succeed. The sister (Haley Bennet) was so endearing how she displayed the love and concern of a big sister and love and patience for her out of control mother, yet being able to have a stable family herself. And lastly, his girlfriend was a great support role. I was very touched and moved to tears when she showed so much empathy towards him through the struggles he was going through. It was beautiful.
It's a sad movie to watch but I highly recommend it. It shows that anyone (no matter where you come from or what the color your skin is) if they are born into a difficult situation, they undergo the same struggles but also have the same opportunity to make better choices and create a better life for themselves. It leaves you with hope in humanity.",Hillbilly Elegy

I think Republicans would too. I do not get the problem with it. But I didn't read the book first .

382,kmary0622,A moving memoir,9,3 December 2020,"The negative reviews from critics are interesting, however not surprising. There is a part of America that is the lower class ""hillbilly"" and/or ""white trash"" that is overlooked. In no way do I want to undermine minorities by saying that. As a white upper middle-class person I think most white middle-class people think of poor people as non-white people. However, since I did not grow up with money, I know that's not true. I've also been to Appalachia on a work project when I was a teenager with my church because I grew up in Ohio (actually close to where the author lived) and I've been to the area of Kentucky that he references, which is extremely poor white. I have seen the poverty these people live in.The reviews are clearly made by people who have never experienced real life. While I have not read the book, I still acknowledge that this is someone's real life experience. Whether or not some critic wants to interpret it as someone's desire to create a new and perfect life for themselves, this was his real life experience. It's awesome that this critic was able to experience the perfect family environment and never have any kind of real trauma in his or her life, but the person who lived this was not so lucky. To critique a memoir, which is someone's interpretation of their real life experience (which is also them coming to terms with the things they've experienced and is also a form of therapy) and rate it poorly because they couldn't connect with it is, to put it frankly, low. (That was the strongest term I was allowed to use.) Good for you. Your life was awesome. If you can't connect with somebody who had a real struggle you shouldn't be a movie critic.I found this movie to be very raw and moving and emotional. Was it probably 100% accurate? No. It's a memoir. It's based on somebody's interpretation of their life. I do not see my parents or grandparents exactly how they actually are/were, because I'm only seeing them through my eyes. That's life. This is through the author's eyes, and that's what should be absorbed. I'm sure my parents will interpret their actions extremely differently than I do. This, like all memoirs, is subjective. It's about our interpretation. It's also about healing and coming to terms with your life. If someone else does not get that, that's on them. We should all have a chance to heal.",Hillbilly Elegy

I would usually dock a star for the distinct lack of Michael Cera, but the lead actor is both hotter and a better actor (not that hard 2bh).

Ron Howard did a compassionate, albeit extreme, treatment. Amy Adams and Glenn Close were the starts they obviously are. Gabriel Basso performed ok for an actor who probably doesn't really have much understanding of that situation.
But finally and most importantly, whether true-based or not, that's an amalgamated story with all the elements. Like the ""perfect country song,"" it has romance, crime, pickup trucks, success, failure,... plus the one that is very rarely actually there because it is way too expensive, heroine. The more realistic elegy would be hard working smart parent but at dead-end job and smart kid with academic scholarship. But of course realistic isn't movie worthy and I get that.

403,jordanlayton,Self-indulgent adversity drama,3,11 May 2021,"Hillbilly Elegy is a 2020 adversity drama directed by Ron Howard and starring Amy Adams, Glenn Close, and Gabriel Basso. This Oscar bait is an adaptation of a rags to riches autobiography of a dude named J. D. Vance - - and I don't know if it's just the way the film presents it, but it comes off quite self-indulgent.The film follows Vance narrating the story of his life as we jump back and forth between his troubled childhood and a crossroads he came to during his university education where he was forced to choose between family and career. Typing it out loud, it seems pretty obvious that this story was going to put Vance on a bit of a pedestal. And that it certainly did.I understand the old montra that ""no one is going to tell your story except you"", but I just got the sense that the main character/autobiographer here is tipping the scales of reality a bit too much into the realm of his own heightened perception of some self-assigned moral high ground. Don't get me wrong, it does seem like an inspirational story and I'm sure Vance overcame adversity on his path to success, but he comes off a bit self-obsessed and self-righteous throughout this film.And yeah, it shouldn't come as a surprise.When YOU are the main character of the story that YOU are writing about your life, you're probably going to be a bit biased. But this film takes that trapping to a whole new level. Vance writes himself as a perfect angel that can do no wrong. He's always either the victim or the the righteous defender and I'm sorry but real life is rarely that black and white.Alright, maybe I'm a little sensitive to this type of thing or something. It's my biggest complaint. But it's not my only complaint.Being the story of this man's whole adolescent life, there's quite a bit of story to tell, but it comes off feeling more like a highlight reel of trauma than a screenplay. The dramatic moments are all back to back to back to back to back so there's barely any room to breath and get to know characters before they're all yelling and smacking each other. The end result is that I barely cared about anyone for most of the film.That said, there were a handful of legitimately effecting dramatic moments that nearly sucked me in and I think they really would have if not for this horribly cliche music. This score is straight out of a Hallmark film. It's injecting emotion into scenes artificially by using the established language of awful scores like this to tell the audience how to feel. And so any scene that almost sucked me into all of this accelerated drama was immediately undercut by the score.The other biggest undercutter of dramatic scenes was the child actor playing Vance. - Look. I understand child actors are always kind of a dice roll. But when it's literally your main character, I think the casting process should probably be a BIT more rigorous. I won't critique a child too much. But yeah. Not great casting.My final nitpick is the camera work. I think this camera team must have been allergic to tripods or something. This is like the life-story drama version of shakey cam. It's extremely distracting.I'm really not sure what Amy Adams and Glenn Close are doing in this movie. Maybe they owed Ron Howard a favor. Their hair and makeup looked pretty good I guess. Oscar worthy??? Sure. Not quite suicide squad level, but sure. Somehow not the worst nomination.3/10.",Hillbilly Elegy

406,dead_angel04,Amy Adams' character ruined this for me,3,25 November 2020,"Maybe some reviewers were harsh for the wrong reasons. And it seems like the trend among the viewers is to praise this film. I mean if you call this emotional and a tearjerker, have you ever watched Forrest Gump? Or even Cinderella Man
(such an underrated film) by Ron Howard himself? And if you call this hard life, have you ever watched Hotel Rwanda? Or thought about how it actually is to live in Rwanda? Or Ethiopia?Ron Howard's direction could have used a different perspective. It lacks focus, vision, balance and essence. The script is so bad. Glenn Close is actually good. Pretty good and that stands for the music and the cinematography too. But Amy Adams' character ruined this film for me. I tried so hard, but it was impossible for me to connect with her and feel for her. It's not Amy Adams' fault, even though she steers towards overacting a bit in this case. It's the character. A person that's so pathetic and terrible, a terrible human being, so selfish, always blaming the others, so undeserving of having a film focused around her.I haven't read the book and I don't care about it. I don't know what's actually real and what's not. This is about the film. JD Vance and Glenn Close's character should have been the main focal points of the film. I understand that Howard tries to make them the emotional anchors of the movie, but unfortunately, I couldn't feel that, at least not until it was too late. Most of the times the film's actually just sad, brutal for no reason and pretentious and it feels like an Oscar bait that's probably gonna end up being an Oscar flop. In the end, this is such a controversial movie that could and should have been better in my opinion. I never had fun watching it, I never really felt engaged even though I tried, but I also think you should watch it and judge for yourselves.PS. Just an update because I saw some comments that really made me mad. I'm actually happy that people liked this film, 'cause well, it's always better liking something than not liking it! When you like something, you're a winner! But liking or hating something, doesn't have to be political all the time. And yeah you can criticize a script based on a true story because, guess what? This isn't a documentary Sherlock, it's a movie script! And thinking that if you criticize something you don't like has anything to do with your life and attacking people this way, whether they liked something or not actually, is at least a sign of having no manners and also totally naive and presumptuous. Just enjoy the movies people or not enjoy them, both are ok, there's no need sharing your repressed anger...",Hillbilly Elegy
407,tikigod100,"A family that could be from anywhere...about heartbreaking addiction, not poverty.",7,6 December 2020,"The problems the family in this film face, are no different than some families face in Los Angeles or any other town. The problems are not unique to so called 'hillbillies' or Appalachia or Middletown, Ohio. Nor are they unique to the poor or homeless.Despite the amazing talent on screen, the film sometimes felt indifferent to its own characters- even though it fairly shows the boy making changes to his life that lead him to a better future. I think this is because all the drama was loud, without any quiet reflection on why mom was in so much pain. It is still a good film.The story shows how addiction and domestic violence affect each generation of a family, by contrasting the boy's choices to his mother's addiction and life. Perhaps people get upset because the film implies that the mother's addiction is her own choice as she at one time refuses help, only to be refused help later after looses her employer provided health insurance.It is unfair to think the film is making any statement on poverty as the film is really about one kid's hardship in dealing with an addicted parent, who eventually listens to the wisdom of his grandma about not becoming an alcoholic/drug addict himself, so he is less prone to poverty. Grandma never says, you better get out of this town if you want to be better off. Grandma never says don't be a hillbilly.It's the film's title that apparently set up critics' expectations that the film should be about poverty and not drug addition, or maybe some felt the film should have delved deeper into the difficulties in overcoming addiction, rather than simply telling the boy's story.I think critics expected something unique concerning hillbillies and poverty due to the film's title, complaining it is preaching the worn out line, 'its your fault you are in poverty.' The film is really only showing that domestic violence and addiction is sometimes carried to the next generation when children follow the bad examples of their parent's addictions, while also showing that families move away from domestic violence and/or addiction, when they decide to avoid alcoholism and drugs. It does not claim that avoiding addiction promises relief from poverty.This film touches on one aspect of poverty- that involving addiction. The film does not cover poverty caused by purely economic woes. It does not cover reason's why populations in towns like Appalachia or any region become impoverished due to economic woe, like industries moving production overseas and closing factories, leaving boom town populations economically depressed.Certainly, since covid-19 pandemic, all Americans, now better understand it takes only economic crisis to suddenly become homeless or impoverished without any ""bad choices"" on the part of the homeless person or family. Surely now older Americans can better understand too, that many homeless have sought employment without finding employment due to age discrimination.Artists have understood this for a long time, having suffered devaluation of their work for decades. From the corporatization of content to internet distributors using ""disruptive pricing"" to become billionaires, artists have had their pay cut over their careers, devaluing their earnings to a degree that means the difference between earning a living from their work to not earning a living. With inflated housing costs, artists have been pinched for a long time.And this downward pressure is increasing for artists in all areas of the economy, with a recent price war developing between AMAZON/PUBLISHERS/AUTHORS and the US LIBRARY SYSTEM.Recently, the American Library Association has petitioned Congress, claiming anti-competitive behavior by Amazon, because Amazon ""bans"" libraries from purchasing eBooks at consumer prices. Amazon does not ban libraries from such, the rights of authors do and with good reason. Amazon also cannot control rights to eBooks outside the Amazon platform. Amazon's business is built to serve the consumer market.The Library is a distributor that now wants to pretend it is a consumer, so it can purchase eBooks like print books, so it (the government) does not have to pay authors and their publishers for distribution rights, even though eBooks are already subsidized for low income families via the Library system.65 million libraries EACH distributed over 1 million eBooks to Library members in 2018, with a 51% increase for demand for eBooks from Libraries during pandemic shutdowns. The Library is also a distributor who is distributing eBooks via 3rd parties-- 3rd party Apps whose developers have no contractual obligations to publishers/authors directly when making deals with Libraries. Libraries are also complaining they can't access digital content from the likes of Netflix, Hulu or Disney+ to lend free to library members.How is Amazon or any retailer suppose to control content rights by licensing to Libraries who want to distribute via Apps... or is Amazon and Netflix supposed to provide free subscriptions to anyone with a Library card, paying authors or filmmakers pennies.Allowing libraries to buy eBooks or movies/TV series, at consumer prices without paying publishers/authors for distribution rights is what is anti-competitive.The Library, a government institution, cannot expect to be on par with Amazon or Netflix or expect to compete with them without paying writers and filmmakers.Libraries get the best distribution deals in the industry already when calculating their costs per reader. Libraries already get to distribute films and shows on DVD paying one time only for any DVD, without paying for distribution rights.If Libraries got their way, they would get to distribute Digital Content paying authors and filmmakers, one time payments of pennies, to potentially distribute a single title to millions of non-paying readers... which, the Supreme Court decided long ago would be unfair to content creators. It is shocking to think Librarians don't understand this or don't care about writers or filmmakers. To allow Libraries to purchase and own single copies of eBooks and allow free distribution would require change to copyrights law.It may be Amazon and Netflix want to distribute to Libraries. It may be they support ""reasonable terms,"" and also want Congress to change copyright to allow their platforms to distribute to Libraries without paying for distribution rights. This would be extremely bad for content creators. Hopefully Amazon and Netflix will support creators by supporting per reader pay terms and not Spotify ""bulk"" ads pricing terms to creative.If you are a writer or a filmmaker, you need to contact Congress and speak up and remind Congress to protect your distribution rights-NOW. You also need to let Amazon and Streaming Services like Netflix know you want PER READER terms at living wages for any sub-leasing to other distributors if such plans for the future are being discussed. If Amazon and Streaming providers support creatives in this issue, it may be good for creatives.",Hillbilly Elegy

410,laudeus,"Earnest, Heartwarming, Ok",6,26 November 2020,"As plots go, this one is quite simple - the story hones in on a couple days when JD is making a last ditch effort to land a summer internship during his time at Yale, when he learns his mother has had a relapse on heroin. JD is faced with a choice that seems a catch-22 - does he abandon his mom and sister to follow-up on a limited opportunity at a firm, and thus ""escape"" the impoverished fate of his family, or throw away everything he has worked so hard for to try once again to help a helpless mother?Because the actual ""current"" events play out quickly over a short period of time, the bulk of the movie is flashbacks in which we learn what makes JD, JD. Unfortunately, the unproven younger JD is soft, not too smart, and not terribly exceptional as far as characters go. And the JD that is developing in the present is one we barely get to know, certainly not enough to start rooting for him. The connecting piece - how JD goes from squirrely teen to responsible adult - is missing.The production value is earnest, with the actors and writers fleshing out all there seems to be to make the best movie possible from what they were given. By that measurement, it's a great success: a story of the complicated feelings for family members that are both loving and terribly broken, a coming of age story in which a boy with no purpose in life finds his purpose and takes on the world.But it falls short because the story is just not that interesting, despite its careful treatment. For some ""priviledged"" viewers, the contrast between JD's life and their own may be significant. However, in entertainment, we want an exceptional story, not one that could be told about millions of Americans if they only had Ron Howard to tell it.As a book, Hillbilly Elegy was significant not because JD's background was so fascinating, but because of his ability to analyze his experience and place it in the context of an often misunderstood populace in America. But without that analysis, JD's story is not that compelling. It is a story not of THE struggle out of poverty, but A struggle, and not the most interesting one. The movie works up to its culmination with a montage of JD learning to take out the trash, respect his mamaw, and figure out algebra. If these are the sole characteristics that got him into Yale, I am not impressed.The movie is warm hearted and does not deserve the malignment it has received from many reviews in the press. But not every book makes a good movie. Hillbilly Elegy the book was social commentary, not entertainment, and should have stayed as such.",Hillbilly Elegy
411,dlb8685,Great Individual Performances and Story,8,19 April 2021,"Amy Adams and Glenn Close both gave incredible performances that reminded me distinctly of actual human beings I've met in the past. I think this shows very well how a bad parent can totally screw up someone's life, and how a great grandparent or other outside figure can redeem it. I hate to jump on the bandwagon of asking, ""wth are the critics thinking?"" but this movie is good enough that I really don't know how else to explain the critics' hate outside of cultural bias.I give it just an 8/10 because the whole Kentucky tangent never made much sense to me -- like he went there at the beginning of the movie and they made it out like it was going to be a recurring theme, and then it just went away. You can be just as much of a hillbilly in Southern Ohio. Also, some of the dialogue bordered on cartoonish to me -- I've hung out with people from the rural South and they don't go out of their way to throw out hillbilly idioms every 40 seconds while they're talking. Maybe I just didn't dive far enough into the abyss?They also just ham it up a bit on the main character being out of place at Yale, a little more than is realistic -- like he would definitely learn which fork to use first long before he was in a formal dinner, even if he didn't grow up in that environment. 90% of Americans didn't grow up in that environment, that's not ""hillbilly"" specific.",Hillbilly Elegy

Author J.D. Vance's portrayal of Appalachia as a hotbed of lazy hillbillies who could escape their everyday hell if only they tried a little harder, like the bootstrap-pulling protagonist, completely ignores the systems and circumstances that have made this region ground zero for the opioid epidemic.Alonso Duralde from The Wrap sums it up best, ""Hillbilly Elegy isn't interested in the systems that create poverty and addiction and ignorance; it just wants to pretend that one straight white guy's ability to rise above his surroundings means that there's no excuse for everyone else not to have done so as well.""It says nothing of the proud people that remain in these communities and persevere, what they're up against, how it got to this point in the first place, what could or should be done, etc. Instead we get (ironically) a lazy, shallow and self-serving retread with nothing meaningful to say.",Hillbilly Elegy
427,dr-ehpage,Don't Buy the Hype - This is an important and excellent film!,9,4 December 2020,"When a friend of mine suggested I read J. D. Vance's Hillbilly Elegy, I shuddered. What flashed across the mind, I told her, were those TV shows featuring the swamp people or Alaskan wild men, depicted now in Appalachian 'hill people' style. She paused and regrouped. She told me again what a great book it was and when I didn't respond, she circled back with another suggestion: ""Well, would you be interested in watching the movie with us? We both have read the book."" ""How can you not admire her persistence,"" I chuckled. Afraid of being sucked into an unwanted rabbit hole and seeking a diplomatic exit, I checked the reviews. Could I find a justification for saying no?
Certainly! I found was the meanest spate of reviews I have read since Spike Lee's Bamboozled, another trashed film I thought was brilliant. Now reviewers were stomping Hillbilly Elegy. They stomped it so hard that I was taken aback. ""Why,"" I wondered. ""Glen Close doesn't do trash,"" I reminded myself. ""Never saw a Ron Howard film not worth my time,"" I recalled. Yet, this film was being choked to death, suffocated like a line of newly caught fish left, high and dry, on the kitchen counter to die. How could that be?
Reviewers who trashed Bamboozled hadn't see its value. They declared it had no value. They predicted it would fail and ridiculed people who liked it. They made fun of Lee's vivid characters and demeaned his film-making. Their message was loud and clear: don't waste your time viewing this movie. That puzzled me. Reading the harsh reviews of Bamboozled was the moment when I became aware of the practice of movie assassination. That's how a movie and its director are killed and in the old days, before Netflix, such movies would not draw and an audience and quickly would be removed from theater circulation.
Bamboozled was not just ahead of its time, it was truth-telling. Truth-telling in Hillbilly Elegy similarly may explain why most reviewers are bashing this film. Is it a mirror reflecting their own lives? Is it mirroring back to the audience an unwanted view of the self?
For instance, Roger Ebert confesses good things about Howard's film, but undercuts his praise of it by declaring that these good things ""vanish in the haze of the zeitgeist,"" while at the same time pointing a displeased finger at Howard's film directing. Ebert describes Hillbilly Elegy as ""hard to appreciate,"" as being ""encumbered by cultural baggage,"" and he seems unable to grasp what I see as the universal appeal of this film. Instead, he restricts the audience he presumes the film is capable of capturing. He reduces its potential audience to a stereotypical 'culture of poverty' frame of reference. As Ebert suggests, you are more likely ""to connect"" with this film if you grew up poor, with addiction and domestic abuse, and with other problems typical of that ilk. If you grew up differently, he further implies under the guise of film critique, then this film is way too trashy for you.
By now we Americans all should realize that the classist condescension dripping from Ebert's review of Hillbilly Elegy is precisely what got Donald Trump elected - an inability of the liberal, moderate, and progressive privileged classes to recognize value in the underclass experience. This especially is the case when such characters are not sanitized according to bourgeois taste and standards of comportment.
As an anthropologist, I saw in Hillbilly Elegy a richly cultural film. It is not just a case of the hill people's cultural specificity. Far more importantly, the story it conveys is about who people become when they collectively are relegated as a class to the bottom of America society where they end up living lives too ignored to enter the national gaze, unless or soft-soaped, also known as whitewashed.
The film offers an astute character study. It focuses on what it takes to keep a family together given their various efforts to survive and thrive as persons in their adverse conditions. The characters in Hillbilly Elegy are living oppressed lives but the film does not preach this theme. It lets the characters themselves tell the story through their action which gives rise to and finally resolves the story's central conflict. Who they are and how they are oppressed is expressed in their postures, in their relations, in their vivid language, and in their struggle against the self-hate threatening to consume them given how meanly they view themselves through American eyes. My friend says that the film is good, but as usual, the book does an even better job at contextualizing their story by revealing the history of America's class relations that creates the disparaged community of J. D's family. Their deprivation is not treated directly but is rendered visible when one of them (J.D.) goes to Yale Law school.
As a first-generation college-educated African American, I can relate to what happened during J.D.'s Yale Law dinner party experience. It parallels similar experiences of mine during my own education and academic career. As a white man he entered a higher-class world. As a black man, I entered a white elite world. But the experience is nearly the same. The snide degrading remarks; the fake apology; the downward glances assumed by the elite insiders when a capable man of lower-class origins lauds his mother's intelligence and celebrates his family's ability to overcome the downtrodden parameters of his underclass background. Eating with poor white trash is one thing, but eating with one who does not agree to feel shame about his origins is one with whom they cannot ""connect."" The scrutinizing elites had an opportunity they could not resist. J.D. was there to be vetted. His colleagues and mentors seized the moment to affirm their own elite class distinction by engaging in put downs of this aspiring young man who family roots are deeply embedded in Kentucky's Appalachian working class.
I won't say much more about the story, but I must say that the acting was brilliant, and the directing, simply masterful. The action was so powerful that my friends and I were clinging to the edge of our seats. We imagined some better-off friends squirming and turning this movie off, and we surmised that if they did, it would reflect their refusal, like Ebert's, to connect with those deemed beneath them, with those in whom it conventionally is presumed no value lies.
We thought Howard handled flashbacks elegantly well, far better than in most films we have seen, but Ebert read Howard's time-management technique as jumping, ""incoherently."" Instead of valuing an incredible study of the way that familial love can threaten to entrap and derail a child (J.D. played by Owen Aztalos) unless someone (his grandmother, played by Glenn Close) is brave and strong enough to break the family's downward spiral. She was able to rescue him from the family tragedy by propping him up until he can swim. Yet, Ebert reads J.D., the central character, as ""constrained by his culture,"" as if spurring him on, much like mule, to break free from family drama and get on with a mandatory display of rugged American individualism. Film critics like Ebert often rely on the director's use of filmmaking conventions to judge movies. Hence, in sharp contrast to Howard's use of stark realism, Ebert criticizes him for not having resorted either to black comedy or to surrealism in a scene where in her earlier life (when J.D.'s mother was still a girl) his grandmother defends herself from domestic violence by lighting her assailant on fire.
Could it be that the desire for such devices serve as a diversion to relieve the reviewers of feeling? I, for one, am glad I felt every raw feeling that this film evoked. I would not want to see that horrific scene treated surrealistically or comedically through black humor. It's not a laughing matter and I do not need the distance of viewing it from a perspective outside of reality. In fact, I would have found it disrespectful of the subject and of the people represented. It would have given the audience an out, allowing it to enjoy the director's approach in a critical moment when the screenwriter is encouraging the audience to take in what is really happening here in America, as if to say: People, this is real!
Perhaps most ignored in this film's reviews is the strength of the women who carry the family, including the rageful, broken daughter, when the men can't show up. That pattern of male unavailability is broken when J. D., the central character, shows up to support his family. He applies the lessons learned from his grandmother when contending with his mother Bev's (Amy Adams) brokenness at a most inopportune time. Rather than to tuck his tail and slink into denial, or throw her away in shame, or regard her as a threat to his intimate relationship and potential for success, J.D. pledges to take care of her for the rest of her life, but no more tonight. He has gotten her a place to stay and evades the forced choice of family or career that capitalism so often imposes. He tackles both and wins in honor of the broken souls who raised him and held him up high, above the fray, high enough to succeed at Yale Law and to craft his family's triumphant tale. I give it ten stars and I highly recommend it.",Hillbilly Elegy

I really enjoyed this movie but leaves me pondering about the (growing) gap between the mostly positive user reviews and the wall of negative professional ones.

435,tarekabdelkader,"Amazing acting from 2 huge actresses, and a good script, but the direction isn't so good.",7,6 December 2020,"The story of the film is divided into two main lines, a line of events in the present and a line in the past, events move in the two lines alternately, this gave a sweet opportunity for creativity in Editing and it was very good and is considered one of the most powerful aspects of the film
This also making the events move quickly and rarely gets boringThe screenplay of the film was also good and benefited from the fact that the story is very rich and have many dramatic aspects, and the film succeeded in making us very sympathetic to many of the characters through strong well-written scenes, Those scenes contain very imaginative ideas about all aspects of the life, here lies the strength the movie is about life, with its punishments and responsibilities on one side, and its sweet moments on the other side. Frankly, we don't have movies that combines all this, recently , even though in the past 2 decades films of this quality were produced every yearUnfortunately, the film's script fell into a big mistake, which is failing to explore all the characters in sufficient depth, meaning that it is satisfied with only analyzing the main character. The rest of the characters which were richer and more complex, were dealt with superficially. The movie failed to highlight the important moments that shaped the characters, and I am here. I'm talking specifically about 2 characters.... the mother and the grandmotherThe second problem in the movie is in directing. personally, I am not a fan of the director (Ron Howard), and I always saw that his style is sluggishn and lazy, but he is a great director and many of those who worked with him said that he is amazing, this may be for reasons other than those that appears on the screen, but for me, he's not among the best ... even though he made excellent movies like (Rush) and (A Beautiful Mind).
In the movie Hillbilly Elegy, Ron Howard made a very big mistake when he neglected the most important scenes in the formation of the characters, scenes like the very difficult experiences that the character went through in the past, which are the only explanation for the dark aspects of our characters. These scenes were very few and neglected, and the rest of the film was delightfully shouted, It feels more to you that it is a fun family movie, although the story is very dark and does not suit the way it appeared in the end, This confused me while I was watching, and I thought that his understanding of the script is questionableThe Acting remain the strongest aspect of the film
(Amy Adams) who always nominated for the Oscar, but unfortunately she never wins, she gave a wonderful performance as usual, and her character was difficult and full of contradictions, many times those of contradictions happens to be in the same scene, meaning she may remains nice and smiley at the beginning of the scene and after less than a minute she explodes like a volcano, Of course it was not easy, but Amy Adams succeeded in this challenge, and I think she would be nominated for the Oscar if the film is in the academy's considerations.
(Glenn Close) also gave an amazing performance She is one of the very talented actresses, and you always feel that she performs without effortIn the end, the movie is definitely worth watching, I recommend it to you all because it suits all tastes

Every single one of these characters are people that I have known, and I suspect many others do too, some just don't want to fess up to where their roots are because it contrasts with the facades we create for ourselves as we attempt to paint away our imperfections for ""our followers."" The truth always comes out, and the truth is, none of us are perfect, we all grew up with some level of dysfunction.It's definitely a tough movie to watch; it's not always black and white in terms of protagonists and antagonists. These are complex characters who, even when they're trying to do ""the right thing"" have moments of genuine dis-likeability. The fact that you cringe so much at times when watching these people self-destruct is a testament to how good the acting and directing is.The story is soulful, believable, and real. This must have been hugely therapeutic for the author and I applaud him for using this as a medium to just vent about all the crazy stuff he had to deal with growing up. I didn't read the book but certainly will now as I felt like the movie glossed over some of the generational pain that manifested itself.As for this having anything to do with politics, I found nothing political about this movie.

The performances are fine, with the exceptions of Close who was fantastic, and they might have been held back by a lacking screenplay that doesn't flow very well in the scenes.

You don't have to share common roots with his family members depicted in this memoir to be able to empathize with the traumas, sometimes chaotic familial conflicts, but also with the love and familial trust and bonds that clearly persist throughout the challenges.

Only the last 10 minutes brings this out of the darkness of the horrible life these people live. I did not grow up this way, but I know that people do. Watching this with my wife and her saying many of the scenes hit home with her childhood, I could not be more humbled by my relatively privileged youth. We were not rich and my mom was a single mother of 2, but she was not an addict. I can't begin to understand what it would be like to add a color of the skin to the equation.Let's talk about the acting. Glenn Close had better win an Academy Award. She was unbelievably good. Amy Adams was good, but really Close was so believable, so real. I can not imagine someone could ever be better. She should be extremely pleased with her work. The younger JD is really far more important in this movie as far as acting goes. The younger JD did well and I think we will see more of him in the future. The elder JD was OK.Ron Howard could be considered for a directing award, but the dark depressing subject matter may hold him back. Maybe not.

468,patronusquill,"Not a masterpiece, but a solid movie",9,24 November 2020,"When it reaches the end credits, it sure feels like those typical movies that end just the same, but it is the content the one that matters here. Glenn Close is the heart and soul of the whole movie and her work the one that carries the plot. It is somehow important to tell the stories that most Americans have: the rural opportunities compared to NY or maybe LA. That contrasting gap between having easy access to school's supplies and having to steal a calculator in order to do homework. Glenn Close nails it, Amy Adams too, but we learn much more about her character's weaknesses than her talents. Adams' character feels truly painful, and that's thanks to her amazing acting method and vulnerability. Hans Zimmer does something beautiful with the score near the end during grandma's death montage, too. I feel like this movie is more about matriarchal families and only those who belong to them will understand the whole spectrum of emotions displayed during the length of it. I didn't adore it, but loved it in a very beautiful way. I cried like... a lot! I really recommend watching it despite all the reviews it may have in the future.",Hillbilly Elegy

And Glenn just captured the tough natured but caring grandmother perfectly.
This is a story about a family who's had its struggles and having to fight to survive. I think it's rare for Hollywood to tackle a subject like this, but this story is not uncommon, in fact I bet everyone I know around Denham Springs, La knows of families similar to this. Growing up with a father who owned a construction company, I saw his employees get their paychecks on Friday and be broke by Monday because of drugs/alcohol while their kids would go without, and at a very young age I knew that 90% of their kids would likely end up just like them.

The second is not developed in a satisfying way. And they're the only things of interest in the movie! This thing clocks in at nearly 2 hours, and there's barely a story.

484,ohdiana-89494,I watched by accident- but glad I did,9,27 November 2020,"I just watched this lovely film and I was sobbing at the end. I had no idea it was a true story until the end, I was delighted to see it was about a real family.
There are some dark parts as well as some truly touching, beautiful parts that opened my eyes to a family dynamic and generational trauma that I think we can all relate to, some more so than others.
After it finished, I wanted to know more about the real life family so I googled the movie and was shocked to see the awful reviews- some down right nasty and spewing venom.
Why the hatred for this family and JD's real life true story? Then one of the articles about the film written here in Australia said apparently it has to do with Trump and JD's political views- his memoir came out right before Trump won the election and these lower income communities from the Appalachian belt were Trump supporters and JD's memoir hit number 1.
So,any film reviewer who hates Trump and the republicans purposely gave this movie a terrible review as some kind of vengeance against JD and his people. How childish! Honestly these reviewers should be fired from their jobs! How unprofessional to leave a bad review for a great movie just because you don't like the authors political choices. Rotten tomatoes are mostly left leaning and will always give a bad review for a movie that doesn't follow their woke narrative and agenda. How ridiculous, honestly!
I am an Australian and I have no political persuasion so who votes for who is irrelevant to me,I vote independent but I would hate for people like me to miss out on seeing this movie because they read the negative reviews- which after watching this movie, are false and full of lies.
Biden won the election recently yet some film reviewers obviously still can't let go of their psychological issues regarding Trump- and they pan this movie as some sort of revenge against his supporters. YOU WON GET OVER YOURSELVES - and maybe get some therapy- the movie was outstanding and Glenn Close deserves an Oscar for her performance. It's worth watching the movie just to see her and Amy Adams own the camera. They are the gift that keeps on giving! Give the film a chance and make up your own mind without letting left vs right politics colour your opinions.",Hillbilly Elegy

Given that it was based on a true story what ever happened, happened. Criticisms of the story remind me of reviews of ""Apollo 13"" complaining of not enough special effects. Amy Adams reminds me of European actors - delivering three dimensional characters and never mind the gurning. Glenn Close was similarly impressive. He and his sister were good too. The build until the final scenes left me having no idea what he was going to do. In a good way. It will do down very well in Europe.",Hillbilly Elegy

I actually enjoyed the movie quite a bit. The book has been used in the last 4 years as a good conversation piece about the white working class, the political establishment, and how that lead to the rise of Trump and Trump-ism. The story depicts life in a rural white community full of generational, long-term poverty as the main character overcomes crippling obstacles to eventually make it out of the community and prosper at Yale Law School.In the eyes of many, particularly those on the political left who oppose Trumpism, the story ends up humanizing and sympathetically depicting the demographic that makes a large portion of Trump supporters. I tend to think that is a big reason why it is getting such horrific, negative reviews. If you remove the political backdrop, and just view the film as a story about a man who overcomes a brutal situation to achieve great success, it is a well-told film. Amy Adams and Glenn Close are exceptional actresses and they are both good in this film. At the very least, it is worth watching once for their performances.",Hillbilly Elegy

498,metqujxw,Hollywood Critics Unfair,8,28 December 2020,"The undeserved poor ratings prove that the Hollywood elitists have totally lost touch with flyover country Walmart America. While we seem to credit ourselves with at least being aware of the desperate plight urban inner city folk, no one until now has cast this much deserved attention to the plight of the working poor of middle America. One of the best lines in the famous movie, West Side Story, is when Lt. Shrank says ""Things are tough all over"". This film proves that it truly is tough all over in America even if you're non inner city white folks.Here we see three generations of working class white America that has not only been cast aside and forgotten by the ruling class but also has forgotten for itself how to resolve its own undeserved problems. The result is a social demographic trapped in a downward spiral of chaos, despair, familial dysfunction and ultimately self destruction - a situation not substantially different from the narrative of the inner city black and brown neighborhoods.The real point of the story is exposing what is only the true solution to the problem that is shredding not inner city America but all of America's disenfranchised ""losers"". While the self righteous overindulged and sanctimonious ""woke"" crowd wants to divide us by race and suggest ""cures"" rooted in socialist dogma, J.D. Vance proves that the problem is not race, but rather is a culture of chaos, laziness, hopeless and self destruction. While he, himself is on the path to his own self destruction, J.D. Vance proves that the solution is not going to come from some beneficent external force to save him, but rather from within himself. If this film falls a bit short, it's in the fact revealed in more detail in the book that the discipline, structure and self reliance that he learned in the military is what saved him from becoming the next generation caught up in a dead end life of chaos and despair. Additionally, one scene that I would have liked to have included in the film was the first dinner that he has with his fiancé's family who are immigrants from India. In the book he describes this dinner as the first family gathering that he's ever attended that didn't end up in a fight and having the cops called. The film successfully draws both a similarity and a contrast between J.D.'s grandparents and his fiancé's parents. Both started a new life with no money, one by emigrating to America and one by emigration from the hills of Kentucky to Middletown OH. The difference is that his fiancé's parents brought self discipline, determination and the values of order over chaos while J.D.'s grandparents brought with them the baggage of generations of social dysfunction.In short, do not allow the Hollywood critics to define this film unfairly. Every American needs to see this film as well as read the book. When I read the book, my first thought that came to mind was that this needs to be made into a movie. Ron Howard did a fine job with this as did the whole cast, but the performance by Glenn Close is Oscar worthy. Although the movie is successful, this would have made and excellent extended Netflix series type drama which would allow for more in depth coverage of the complex mosaic of human pathos that J.D. artfully brings to light.",Hillbilly Elegy

514,mlwotowiec,Politics,9,6 December 2020,"Have you read the memoir? If not, you should.
That said, this film did a very nice job at portraying a man struggling to move on from his past while keeping true to who he is (this is a formula - read or seen The Glass Castle? Similar story of a child who grows up in a toxic environment and struggles to pull themselves out of it while still loving the key players in their childhood).
So why the critics' poor reviews? I would argue that the critics want to see a film that focuses on an institutional problem (such as the poor in Appalachia) but provides a blanket fix for everyone involved - not just for the one man who told the story (his fix was that his grandmother and teacher helped him see who he could be). The reviews I have read criticized the film for making the assumption that because one white boy was able to climb out of his station, that everyone should be able to. Hence why I titled this review ""Politics"". The memoir goes much deeper into the economic world JD grew up in and provides a lot of statistics and historical accounts that have led to the past and current economic situation. It also discusses a very conservative viewpoint in regard to a solution - one which focuses on people taking responsibility for their actions and supporting themselves, rather than relying on government aid, etc.
The film doesn't go into as much detail, but I am sure the critics are aware of JD Vance's political views, and as this is his memoir, I am certain they have a problem with his interpretation of the resolution.The film is not perfect, but it is very good and is definitely worth the watch. Mary Karr's Liars' Club and Jeanette Wells' The Glass Castle are two other memoirs you should checkout if this story pulled at your heart strings.",Hillbilly Elegy

Glenn Close and Amy Adams are fine actresses, to be sure, and save it from being completely ordinary. Will this be the vehicle for Ms. Close to finally win an Oscar, after 7 nominations?An artistic flourish that distinguishes this from usual cable fare is the constant cross-cutting between past and present, which I found annoying rather than appealing.The critics are skewering this movie, motivated (I suspect) in at least some of them by partisan animus- the memoir upon which it's based is explicitly right-wing, although Ron Howard seems to have leached the overt political content out of it. It remains at heart, however, a Horatio Alger story, where the hero is able to overcome a dysfunctional family background and poverty through hard work and bourgeois values. Bully for him.

She loved it. Had me up to her Central Park West apartment the very next evening to discuss it with me. Subsequently, we had many long talks about movie after movie. This isn't to brag. It's to establish my legitimacy.Something is very wrong here with the reviewers. That Amy Adams and Glen Close had to defend the movie as a story having nothing to do with politics says it all. Critics have been swept up in the hyperpolitical craziness of our times. It isn't just Trump and the media. The craziness will continue without him.

I hated to leave those beautiful, richly meaningful hills AND the mountains of just-next-door West Virginia, where my family had long been entrenched, but there was high unemployment and I was single. After my military years, then leaving to spend time with my family, now retired to Florida, then to Houston, Texas, where both parents passed away, I (being on 100% disability and living in assisted living), headed back to the mountains, this time the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, where the economy is slightly better, and where my ancestry originated. As for the movie, my own family is stacked on both sides with substance abuse and mental health problems, seemingly common in Appalachia, sprinkled with suicides completed and suicides attempted. the movie, I thought, was somewhat over-dramatized, as the people I knew and know are somewhat reticent to fight LOUDLY in public or to have the law called on them.

In one way or another this is many people's reality, different circumstances notwithstanding.The situations so realistically depicted here occur in America, Ireland, South Africa, India, Egypt, Nigeria, Argentina, Israel, Australia....in fact universally. I could go on and on, but I have to mention that the acting and directing are near faultless, with Amy Adams and Gabriel Basso excelling and then there's Glenn Close - delivering a master class in acting.

The Hillbilly-factor has absolutely no point in this film, which I kind of miss. The story about Mamaw and Papaw is untold, which I think is a big mistake. What's left is a story about a boy with an abusive addicted mother and how he deals with that. Maybe that would have been enough.

I also work at a school where 98% of the students are extremely impoverished, and while not Appalachia, this book helped me to understand some of their thinking, issues, ways of dealing with things in life, that, I think, made me a better, more compassionate, and understanding teacher. I realize that while I know that education is their way out of poverty, for most kids in poverty, survival is their main priority and unfortunately can't always access that education that is so important.
When I read that this movie had been made, I saw that people were upset that it was politicizing the people of Appalachia. Unlike the book, there was absolutely NO political undertone in the movie. I also didn't see anything all that stereotypical about the people of Appalachia. This story could be anywhere in the US where people are living in poverty and suffering the negative effects of that situation. One of my favorite parts of the movie was when all of the people saluted Pawpaw's hearse. I thought it showed a real sense of community and respect of the people of Appalachia.

My opinions are my own and I don't claim to be a professional film critic nor do I understand some of their comments. This film was one of the best films I've seen in the last couple of months on Netflix.. This film also reduced me to tears 5 times.As for the acting? I've seen critics label it over the top.. Though myself and others who watched this film with me, all praised the actors within 10 minutes of the film starting.. So this is solely based on your own opinion of what good acting is. I have always been a slightly harsh critic of bad acting and 'B class films' but this films acting had me emotionally invested.As for the political point, not speaking enough on real issues... This is a man's life. HELLO CRITICS, CAN YOU HEAR ME IN THE BACK. Who are we to say that the film lacks the right message? It's based on the life of a man who lived through these very experiences. I read an article speak on Adams acting, ""She's a banshee"".. For all we know this woman could have been exactly like this. Is this Adams fault? Or the real life character?I feel critics are viewing this film as a chance to speak on poverty, political issues etc. This film touches on that and yes the editing can be improved.. but this was someone's life, just as you can't judge the memoir as it was his life, how can you say it lacks the right message?Great film, could have touched more on his time at Yale or atleast how he got there. This film had hours to take us on a journey through someone's incredibly sad, underprivileged life.. Take it as that, and don't judge it based on what message it lacks.",Hillbilly Elegy
565,biedrzyckinoah,The critics didn't get it,8,25 November 2020,"As someone who loved the book, the movie was underneath it rating wise but the movie still captures the story and the lessons well. Starting off with the negatives, it focuses too much on the ""current day"" of the movie setting. Vance in his book talked very briefly about his visit home to Ohio to take care of his mother. The movie needed to focus more on his time in the Marines, how before moving in with Mamaw Lindsey pretty much raised him, JD reuniting with his biological father after he thought he abandoned him, and how Papaw was the only real father figure he had. Including more flashbacks that included these key moments in JD's life would have made the movie much better. Now why the critics didn't get it. The movie might have been too smart with the implications it gave the audience. JD is a conservative that provides a different perspective on why the ills of a culture exist. For social constructionists, the movie doesn't make any sense because it doesn't line up with their worldview. JD believes that people get stuck in a cycle of poverty because the culture they grow up in is inherently negative. If JDs mother grew up in a better house and neighborhood and given the proper guidance, she would have been incredibly successful. The book focuses on this much more where the movie hints at it. At what point can you blame her for being a terrible mother? The only way you can get better, to JD, is if you take responsibility for yourself and slowly get better. JD is an exception. The only reason he didn't end up like his mother was because he got lucky in his youth. Of course he worked hard to improve himself, but he happened to have a good enough social network (early on being Lindsey and Mamaw and later Usha) to nudge him in the right direction. The story is not about JD. It's about his mother, who is in the majority, and about how taking personal responsibility is the only way out. The scene that showed when his grandparents moved to Middletown vs it current day is shown when the factories shut down and the jobs left. This is also the area of the country that helped Donald Trump win in 2016. These people are desperate to escape and JD is writing them a letter on how. The government won't save you so the only way is to do it yourself. The movie and book will resonate more with people who understand that struggle and I feel like the critics who don't understand how Trump won will not understand the point of this story either.",Hillbilly Elegy

I recognized the strength it took for Mawmaw to take J.D. away from his mom. I loved the story that was told. I would highly recommend this movie.

I thought the film was an excellent, multilayered narrative that captured the essence of one man's experience. The acting is excellent and the time jumps work well (in illustrating the ways our past informs our future). It isn't meant to be a political commentary or dissection. If you're expecting as much, you may be disappointed. If you watch the film, however, and judge it independent of the political expectations that have been dumped on it - I think you'll enjoy it.

I was not aware that so many ""hillbillies"" moved to town and the problems that were created in their lives being transplanted. I went to parochial

Here is the reason they are some bad reviews. Some people have never experienced THIS life . They have no idea that people actually do LIVE LIKE THIS .
KUDOS to Ron Howard who also did not grow up in Hillbilly Country but did an excellent job of making this TRUE STORY so accurate on screen.
All the lead actors were amazing and they TRULY portrayed the people they were supposed to be in this.
One of my friends said they only part she didn't like was the CURSING .
"" Did they really need to use that language?"" She asked me .
Absolutely. THAT is normal language for these poor small towns .
If you grew up there you would understand that. F%$@$ was a word I heard as child as commonly as rich people hear "" yes sir"" . It was necessary for them accurately portray these people .
This movie made me cry , because it was TRUE TO LIFE . It brought back many memories for me . I lived this . I too chose to leave and "" be someone.""
Thank you Glen Close for portraying "" Meemaw"" so incredibly well .
I know . I had a Meemaw just like that .

However, the negative reception became so over the top that I began to suspect that something was not quite right. The people that disliked it did so on such a visceral level that I knew there was more to it than the film itself. It wasn't until viewing the film that I discovered why. The film dares to humanize poor Southern Whites- ""deplorables"" as leftists call them. What I saw was a profoundly moving family drama about poverty, addiction, and overcoming all odds. The performances were fantastic and Ron Howard does a great job directing as always. I'd recommend this film to anyone.",Hillbilly Elegy

The movie wasn't perfect; significant portions of J.D.'s backstory were glossed over, and his relationship with his sister fell a little flat as well. Of course, consolidation and simplification are to be expected when adapting book to film.In any case, the superb acting (especially from Glenn Close and Amy Adams) more than made up for the shortcomings in the storyline. Contrary to some of the reviews I've read, I didn't think the film was melodramatic at all. While some scenes were incredibly intense, they weren't overacted - or overwritten.",Hillbilly Elegy

Proud people that lost a middle class status for no fault of theirs, compounded by predatory lending practices, being taken advantage of by the opioids industry, forgotten by politics, left and right. This is how life really is there, where is easy to let go to despair and hope and if anything, the movie is just too nice and politically correct where, if anything, the sense of total despair doesn't come through in full force.

I thank God, like this main character, my kids had a family 'village' to help guide them and provide positive influences and guidance when I didn't. This movie is spot on and real, so very real.
My oldest daughter is now a lifestyles enrichment coordinator at an assisted living facility, my middle daughter is my Yale grad (2011) - with an online financial education business supplying college and high school kids with curriculums to help them also go beyond their raisin'. My boy is working hard in a field he enjoys and is a good man. But for that family, things could have turned out very differently.
I winced and teared up watching the boy struggle and learn his way with the help of those around him, and then have to face reality again as his future was looking bright.

What's wrong with that?Nothing. It's a good message. Drugs are bad for us. Hard work generates great rewards.Let's pose another question. ""Why are so many Americans born into hardship?""""YOU LAZY, EFFETE, LIMP-WRISTED COMMIE! HOW DARE YOU!""Our cultural gatekeepers from the upper class love those bootstrapping Horatio Alger yarns. Whether they're Hollywood liberals or think tank blowhards, the rich don't want the poor to think in terms of class structure and policy. We the proles must only be taught to think in terms of ""personal responsibility.""The drug-addled mother and the iron-willed grandmother are stereotypes the elites used to assign to African-American families of the inner cities. When politicians and their corporate overlords gave the post-industrial finger to our black comrades, they chalked it up to ""personal responsibility."" It was all cut social services, build more prisons, and traffic crack cocaine into their neighborhoods. That was during my eighties adolescence.Today, Joe Biden and BlackRock bigshots are giving the the same dirty finger of ""personal responsibility"" to white folks in de-industrialized rural America. J.D. Vance is one of the Judas goats for the ruling class. Get the masses to blame themselves for systemic oppression and lead them to the abattoir.Mind you, it's not all one or the other. Richie Rich from Darien also gets hooked on drugs and drops out of high school. The difference is Richie Rich gets to go to a gilded rehab palace in the Poconos. Richie Rich gets a no-show job at Daddy's hedge fund. He can afford to **** up. Billy Bob from Duddie's Branch gets only ONE bite at the apple.Richie Rich and Billy Bob are both human and to err is human. It is in the consequences of ****ing up where we find the deep-seated injustice. Messrs. Vance and Howard will never go there.I did enjoy the story itself. Ron Howard makes the movie fun and tasty.

609,ggernes,Definitely Worth Watching,8,5 December 2020,"I read the book shortly after it came out in 2016. I enjoyed the movie, but I think that this movie would do more for those than have not read the book - which is 99%+ of the population - so it would make sense that they make this for the an audience that hasn't read the book.Trying to make a movie about the human condition can be difficult, but I think the movie did a good job of illustrating it at many different points. I liked the beginning scene where adult JD is at a fancy cocktail party/dinner/whatever with colleagues, as it shows the stark contrast. However, I think the movie goes back to the adult version of him too much. The flipping back and forth between his youth and current day works fine, but I'm left thinking that a straight chronological trip through his youth would have been better. Papaw was a very central character in JD's childhood, yet hardly gets mention in the movie except for when he dies. I think that JD deciding to leave for the Marines would have also been an interesting storyline that very much contributed to the story (I could have seen that as a good ending if the story was told 100% chronologically).Hillbilly Elegy is one of my favorite books, so I think it's only natural to be nitpicky about the movie given that is the case.

I will take a big bet and say that everyone is mad about this movie because it seemed too hypocritical when in reality there are people who have addictions who are in fits of rage every five seconds it feels like, I don't understand why critics do not see that Ron Howard was trying to portray what living with someone like Bev could have been like. I also think that the critics got it wrong that JD thought he was better than his family all the time. In his childhood of course you are going to say those remarks, you're still a kid but when he grows older you see the evolution of how he deals with his mother, though slow, it's a lot to go through. Having had my own trouble with my parents I get not wanting to go back, especially when someone is that bad to be around, but at the end of the day you have realize you just have to let go.

621,ftvbqfaa,Excellent portrayal of a remembered life.,10,7 December 2020,"When i watched this movie, I was not aware of the story or its content. But I was invested as soon as I saw the people and the situations. My grandparents were exactly like Mr. Vance's. Pregnant at 13 and headed from the hills of Kentucky to a similar place in Ohio. I did not live the same kind of life he did, but my roots are the same. My parents and my siblings all worked very hard at not floundering in the poverty and want that often accompanies ignorance. All the folks who have criticized and railed at Mr. Vance's depiction need to keep their peace. This is his story. He lived it. He was not writing about me or you. If you are upset that his grandmother pointed out the truth of personal responsibility to be the key to climbing out of a difficult situation, then you do not recognize truth. When you set aside what is holding you back, whether it is culture, racism, or economic situation, and you make choices to shift to personal accountability, you will be amazed at what great changes will occur. To deny this as a means of progress is to deny a proven outcome. Anyone who has escaped from poverty and who grew into a better life can look back at their progress and mark each successful step with the acknowledgement of a mentor, a teacher, a pastor or a parent who encouraged them to be personally responsible in all things. Everyone can make that choice. Watch the movie and be happy for Mr. Vance. Stop making everything about you or your agenda. It is a fine movie, well written and well acted by all.",Hillbilly Elegy
622,nicholaszworkman,Mixed Feelings,5,7 December 2020,"When I read the critics' reviews for the film, I went into watching this film -- based on the bestselling memoir about a young man's rise from humble Appalachian origins to graduating from Yale Law school to becoming a tech millionaire -- with low expectations. I was surprised to find that the film was not nearly as bad what the critics had said. Most of negative reviews seemed to be directed at JD Vance, the author of the memoir on which the book is based, because of his conservative viewpoints. As a liberal myself, I will say that Hollywood can be notoriously biased.The highlight of the film was the performance by Glenn Close as Mamaw. Owen Asztalos is also very convincing as a young JD. Some of the topics covered in the film are relatable to a wider audience -- the poverty mentality, codependency, substance abuse, and domestic violence -- and certain portions of the film certain pull at the heartstrings of the audience.Still, the film suffers from pitfalls that cannot be overlooked. The dialogue and acting at times come off as melodramatic. Amy Adams, despite doing her best as Bev, comes up short because of a contrived script. Her histrionics are a big detractor, and it makes it harder for the viewer to sympathize with her. The constant flashbacks between JD's past and his ""present""-day setting as a Yale Law student disrupt the overall flow of the film.Hillbilly Elegy in sum is an OKAY movie. Not bad, not great. From what I hear, the book offers a much more nuanced portrayal of JD's Appalachian upbringing and serves as a sort-of political narrative about the rise of Donald Trump among working class whites. I have yet to read it, but it may be a better starting point than this film.",Hillbilly Elegy

630,egould-72920,Ignore the critics. Seriously they completely miss the point.,10,26 December 2020,"Growing up in a poor family in Appalachian Pennsylvania, this film hits home. I was lucky enough to have good parents, but with a lot of financial trouble (though we were thankful for what we did have) and a lot of family drama. The problem the critics have is that in today's ""woke"" climate, they can't possibly conceive how poor white people can exist. I have no doubt in my mind that if you took this same story and applied it to the inner-city they would be calling for it to receive Academy Awards. Many of my friends (many who grew up in the inner-city) sympathized with the characters in the story, as we really were two sides of the same coin, with the same problems.The part that bothers me about the critics' reviews is them claiming it's somehow political. The book itself is written by a conservative, and takes a stance on things like the dependency of welfare, but the film is completely devoid of anything political. There are two scenes in the movie where J.D. mentions wanting to watch shows about the current affairs at that time (such as the Monica Lewinsky affair), but it's a blink and you'll miss it type of remark both times. The real J.D. Vance is a political commentator so it makes sense that young J.D. is interested in politics even as a teenager.This film also takes no stance on race. The Appalachian region is predominately white, but suffer the same problems as inner-city minorities. Critics look from the windows of their big-city apartments and don't understand what it's like to have a booming industry and then suddenly one day they wake up to broken communities where many people left since the jobs dried up.The acting was absolutely top notch. Anyone who grew up in these mountains had a ""Mamaw"" in their family who was tough as nails and had a ""take no prisoners"" approach to dealing with conflict. The cast had great chemistry and made a believable family.This is a very uncomfortable film to watch, especially if you've lived in this area for a sizable portion of your life. Escape is often difficult, and even when you get out (such as I did), no other place feels like home.",Hillbilly Elegy
631,rebeccarios-73251,A must see movie,8,30 December 2020,"I felt compelled to write a review because of all the negative reviews of this amazing movie. First, thank you to JD Vance for having the courage to share his story. I cried like a baby when I saw the movie because it opened up so many memories I have and the abuse I experienced as a child. What I think a lot of people do not understand is it really doesn't have to do with where you grow up, the north or south. It is about the struggles of a blue collar family. I grew up in a town in Massachusetts and ended up moving South to study. I only returned home to visit. The memories and struggles traveled with me and it has taken years to heal. I am so grateful that the movie captured this reality of life.",Hillbilly Elegy

644,NH_Claret,Divides Opinion But Worth Your Time,7,31 August 2021,"This movie seems to have divided opinion across both the critics and the general public and this is echoed by the fact that Glen Close received both an Oscar and a Golden Raspberry nomination. The story moves between the present day with a young J. D. Vance making his way at Yale intertwined with various scenes from his challenging childhood. Based on Vance's best selling memoir, ultimately it is worth investing your time in this one with some fine performances from the leads, not least Gabriel Basso as Vance. Critics have focused upon its maybe lazy and stereotypical view of certain US communities, better perhaps to dwell upon its messages of hard work, hope and the importance of family. The pay-off is worth the wait alongside the subtle message that it is not just the USA that faces such challenges around poverty, class, upward mobility and educational opportunities. If you are still undecided this is a Ron Howard picture and you will see Glen Close and Amy Adams in a surprising new light. Well worth a view.",Hillbilly Elegy

The story and performances were so engaging that it kept my interest for the whole hour and fifty-six minutes. Glenn Close's portrayal of Mamaw is so nuanced and powerful, that when she is on the screen she overshadows everyone else. Every emotion is seen on her face, from the guilt she hides inside for not supporting her daughter Bev when she needed her, to the strength and determination she summons to help her grandson J.D. and not repeat the cycle of broken dreams and despair.

Other than that, the portrayal was agonizingly real. I know these people-not specifically, but just like them-and know what it looks like (directly and vicariously) to try to rise out of the mess and still be connected to it.

The cast was absolutely perfect. I always go look at the real characters and the actors never look enough like them if any at all, this was the best casting I've ever seen. And Ron Howard was the best director for this movie.
I'm a southerner and know many country folks and some are as loud and in your face as this family was. Some with alcohol or kid issues but none with quite so much drama, but condensing many years of turmoil into 2 hrs would be dramatic. but I have no doubt it was accurate.",Hillbilly Elegy

It's such a beautiful film. Not many modern movies handle moving back and forth in time well - this one did.Adams, Close and the rest of the cast did very well. I'm looking out for films with Gabriel Basso.This movie is about family and Mamay says it brilliantly, ""Family is the only thing worth a damn."" I felt conflicted the entire time about whether J. D should stay with his mother and help his sister or head back for his interview. I think that conflict was very well handled.I cried multiple times and it kept me engaged the entire time. There are so many people that need to feel uplifted in the midst of this oppressive climate where we are basically told that we can't rise above our circumstances unless someone or some system helps us.And the fact that this is a true story is the icing on the cake.I don't understand the low critic ratings and didn't find much of substance in why the critics gave such low scores.

Having grown up in the south with family deriving not far from the Appalachian area, this film was able to visually and emotionally portray the particular generational trauma that gets past down through families living in poverty in the south.It's not always easy to explain how unprocessed trauma or suppressed emotional distress can manifest into a life of addiction and neglecting responsibilities to take care of oneself which spills over to an inability to properly care for the subsequent children.Ron Howard did a wonderful job in showing each characters struggles without making a single person be to blame for the overall distress the family felt. He also did not victim shame any characters for having issues they needed to grow from.It's an inspiring story and should be recognized for delving into such a complex topic in a way that doesn't invalidate any of the characters challenges or how they fight to break the cycle of generational trauma.",Hillbilly Elegy

Unfortunately, real life will be dramatic with a lot of yelling when there is a drug addicted parent involved. J.D. proved that a child who is born into a bad situation doesn't have to grow up and be stuck in that situation. There are more and more kids being raised by grandparents because of drug and alcohol addicted parents. This movie gives hope to those kids..that there is something better.",Hillbilly Elegy
693,davidtorske,A Mediocre Film that Struggle with Purpose,2,2 May 2021,"First, I never read the book upon which this movie is based. That said, you would almost would had to have been living under a rock not to hear about it. My understanding it that it was somewhat loved at first but now has becomew controversial as the author, J. D. Vance has come out as a MAGA type, considering running for office as a GOP candidate. I really don't care about any of that.However, what I do care about is how wasted Amy Adams was in this role, and how mediocre Glenn Close was. I'm not sure how so many people found that clicked performance ""mesmerizing"" or what have you. The critics had this right, it is a shambling mess of cliches (""pull yourself up by your bootstrap"" sort of stuff) and blindness.It was a real disappointment for sure -- had high expectations with it being directed by Ron Howard. Loved ""Rush"" and ""A Beautiful Mind,"" but this was a miss for me.",Hillbilly Elegy
694,margaritasola,Why the low ratings?,10,2 December 2020,"It was amazing the life storytelling. The way the struggle was presented was sensible. We felt their pain, the reinvindication, the perseverance. We think it was greatly presented.",Hillbilly Elegy
695,jeff-taylor-240-177473,Absolutely the best film of 2020!,10,7 February 2021,"The acting, writing, directing, and filming of this movie is simply outstanding. My goodness but Glenn Close is so believable that she reminds me of the actual grandmother. This is a must see drama about family, forgiveness, and redemption!",Hillbilly Elegy
696,mike_terres,Metacritic score?,9,1 December 2020,"Hillbilly Elegy is a gripping, wonderfully directed and acted film that kept my attention throughout. I did not know that Glenn Close was ""Mawmaw"" until after finishing the movie, which blew my mind. Her realism in the role was amazing. The only reason I can think of for such a low metascore, and even worse Rotten Tomatoes score is that the critics took their opinions on the subject matter out on their reviews. Film snobiness. Yes, it was hard to find sympathy for the characters, but this true story wasn't really about ""Mawmaw"" and the addict ""Bev"". Yes, these family dynamics really do exist. I did not feel like it was an exploitation film. It was about J.D., and the obstacles on his journey to success. Maybe J.D. didn't meet an outsiders criteria of a ""true hillbilly"". But in modern society, we have become a melting pot of many cultures that we cross paths with in our life experiences. Those experiences in Jackson, KY had a profound impact on him. 9 out of 10.",Hillbilly Elegy

698,mrhworth-46445,Great film!,10,27 November 2020,"Highly recommended. I would also recommend reading the book first-it gives more depth to the characters, and allows the movie to bring them to life.",Hillbilly Elegy
699,alecio-77058,"Touching movie, Oscar worth performances",10,25 November 2020,"The movie is very good, sad, it makes you think about life, people, human nature...The cast did a great job and I can see Oscar nominations on their way, I'll be surprised if Glenn Close and Amy Adams don't get nominated.",Hillbilly Elegy
700,chrispino,Can't stop thinking about this movie,10,27 November 2020,"I can't understand the negative reviews by left wing critics. Maybe I'm not sophisticated enough. The acting, story and dialog were all riveting. One of the best movies I've seen in a while. I usually object to excessive use of profanity but in this movie it was very appropriate.",Hillbilly Elegy
701,jennifervoytek,"Real, Raw and Captivating",10,25 November 2020,"I am from Alabama. This true to life depiction best represents some of the worst issues that we struggle with in the south. I can't speak for any other area of the country, but I think many of us in the south can relate to the struggle of escaping poverty, family abuse and drug addiction. I found myself completely engrossed in this movie.",Hillbilly Elegy

703,mlcruz-07219,This movie is NOT bad but characters and content can make some viewers uncomfortable,7,30 November 2020,"This is not an Everyman movie. It is not meant to be entertaining but it is educational, revealing and truthful about what it's like to deal with poverty, addiction and abusive family dynamics. Not everyone can relate because at times, it is uncomfortable to watch. Putting judgment and raw emotions aside, in the end, it is about hope, tough love, determination, resourcefulness and survival.So glad I ignored the reviews saying it was a ""bad"" movie because the movie itself is not bad. It's very well-done. I think it's just the cringe-worthy character defects that cause many reviewers pan it because maybe they were not expecting such a giant dose of reality showing up - a reality they want no part of and don't want to understand because it scares them.It shows the ugly side of the human condition and it highlights moments when we have an opportunity to make decisions that can be life-altering. It's a story about connections, and about learning when and how to either strengthen them or release them in order to keep moving forward in life.NOTE: This should be required viewing in all addiction recovery programs.",Hillbilly Elegy
704,scottjordantx,Great Story!!,8,2 December 2020,"Whether it is or is not a ""true story"", this movie is fully captivating. I found myself rooting for all of the well-defined characters - even when they were doing ugly things. There's a lot of love in this movie. Between mother-daughter between grandmother-grandson and between son and his troubled mom and stern grandmother. I was ready to dislike the movie based on bad press, but I found it to be full of great believable characters going on a really tough journey.",Hillbilly Elegy
705,natalieemcintosh,Why the bad reviews?,9,26 November 2020,"This is about the movement of Kentuckians to Middletown, Ohio. It's HUGE. So many came to work. The mill built up, things changed. It is literally ONE families struggle. For all those stating it paints Middletown, Ohio in a negative light. Stop. I'm a transplant. I've been here 17 years. This could happen in ANY town in America.This is one persons struggle to pull himself up by his bootstraps and BE SOMETHING.It is heartfelt. It is sincere. The bad reviews? Middletown residents being hurt that it painted ""them"" in a negative light. This is any town, if you do not believe that look again and be honest.",Hillbilly Elegy

711,bethtx-06947,Don't Listen to the Critics,7,1 December 2020,This is a good movie with an important story. Don't listen to the critics. I suspect the bad reviews are based on politics and not the content of the film. It definitely deserves your attention.,Hillbilly Elegy

I think it is easy for critics whose life experiences are so different to see this as an exaggeration or a falsely political statement, but this is real life for families from appalachia and the midwest. The rates of addiction, mental health issues, intergenerational trauma, and sitting at the cusp of enough all the with enough just out of reach but help so far behind. This is real life. It is not polished, pretty, or white washed. This is life.",Hillbilly Elegy

A story of personal growth founded in the values of a dysfunctional family trying to overcome all sorts of difficulties... A fresh take in times in which the hegemonic narrative is that we need to depend on elephantiasic governments to surface in life instead of trust in our own capacities and our values to do so; which is a fallacy... Great performances and honest heart felt moments!",Hillbilly Elegy

JD Vance didn't marry the government to succeed! He did it through his strong character and work ethic!
Really enjoyed this movie, and unless you are a total WOKE person, you will too!",Hillbilly Elegy
716,susandswanson,Glenn Close is awesome,7,1 December 2020,I dont care for the jumping around from present time to the past so much but Glenn Close deserves an OSCAR. Amy Adams is spectacular too (my favorite actress.).,Hillbilly Elegy
717,joelsearls,"Accurate portrayals of people from Appalachia, worth seeing for the acting and characters",9,8 December 2020,"JD Vance's book was treated well and professionally by Ron Howard and Imagine Entertainment. Strong performances from the leading cast with Glenn Close stealing many scenes. Amy Adams is wonderful as JD's mother Bev where Gabriel Basso is great as the older version of JD.Having grown up around Appalachia I have met most of these characters at one point in time in my life or another, so I am speaking from experience in how well the culture and people with their struggles are represented. Not too many punches pulled, where the film could have been a tad stronger without some of the political elements disappearing from the book when transferred to screenplay. Worth the watch and the read.",Hillbilly Elegy
718,jonnybkane,Heartache. Hardship. Hillfolk.,8,12 December 2020,"A great depiction of poverty, pride and family in rural America. Amy Adam's is amazing as always, Glen Close provides a legendary performance and it's just an overall satisfying 2 hours that takes you through a journey of a poor white family who came from the hills.A forgotten culture and country; the beginning scene where it transitions from 50s Ohio to present day is a sadly startling reminder of the degradation that's occurred in (especially poor working-class) America since the time of the ""American Dream"".A well done FILM from Netflix.

721,imdb-84228,S Jersey is so much like this country's South!,9,19 January 2021,I'm glad this movie was made and I guess the critics who are sharing negative reviews don't understand the reality of this type of impoverished existence. Hillbilly Elegy shows what makes the possibility of rising up from such imprisonments so wonderful. This movie beautifully shows why so many of us cherish the American Dream.,Hillbilly Elegy
722,dandelionpuff,Highly recommend,8,30 November 2020,I dont get these critics of the actors and Ron Howard. It's like a personal vendettas. I definitely felt for this guy growing up and what he endured. The choices he had to make and the tug of war between family and trying to build his life away from drama. Glenn Close is extraordinary. Amy Adams is transformed. Ron Howard is a sensitive thoughtful director.,Hillbilly Elegy

I usually believes in review, so if i saw that this mkvies have a low rating than i prob didnt watch this. Hillbilly Elegy is one of the good ones in 2020. Critics and reviewers didnt do this movie justice. This movie is about family. This movie is a love story. It can give you heartache and feel loved at the same time. Movies doesnt have to be complicated or hard to understand. It have to be universal.",Hillbilly Elegy
725,lciummo,Unlike the book but very engaging,9,29 November 2020,"Amy Adams and Glenn Close do a great job recreating a slice of the lives in the JD Vance book. While the book has political overtones, the movie is a bit more subtle about the troubles in small-town Appalachia.",Hillbilly Elegy
