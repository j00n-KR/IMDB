0,bkoganbing,Blast from the past,7,1 December 2015,"Yuppie couple Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall see to have a nice lock on the American dream. He's just gotten a promotion at work and she becomes pregnant with their first. One fine day Joel Edgerton a friend from high school greets them at the local supermarket. At first Bateman doesn't quite recall him, but it becomes clear and it's not with any fondness he remembers Edgerton. But soon enough he starts insinuating himself into their lives.If you think you know where this one is going let me assure you that you don't. It turns out that Hall really does not know the guy she married. Bateman did Edgerton some real dirt back in high school and it's not been forgotten. What it was I can't lest I spoil the viewing. But it was nasty.In fact back from my long ago high school days I knew someone who had that happen to him. I also knew bullies like Bateman who did things like what he did.The Gift is a good film and will hit home for a lot of people.",The Gift
1,Leofwine_draca,Middling psycho thriller,5,31 July 2017,"THE GIFT is an all-too-familiar psycho thriller, a labour of love for actor Joel Edgerton who wrote and directed the piece as well as playing the psycho, whose motivations are better-written than usual for the genre. Unfortunately the film itself is a somewhat laidback production, one which lacks the tension that marks the best of the genre. The storyline feels familiar and too slow, and you never really invest in the lives of the main characters; Jason Bateman is perhaps too good at playing his jerk of a character, although British actress Rebecca Hall is very convincing for her part. The film has some decent twists and surprises at times, but the ending peters out to a real anticlimax that does nothing but make the viewer feel let down.",The Gift
2,SnoopyStyle,great creepiness,8,2 April 2016,"Simon Callum (Jason Bateman) and Robyn (Rebecca Hall) are married with a new house. They've moved from Chicago back to his home town. He has a new high-powered job. One day, they run into Simon's high school classmate Gordo Moseley (Joel Edgerton). Gordo starts insinuating into their lives making Simon very uncomfortable and leading to a secret from the past.This has great creepiness right from the start. In the beginning, it seems to be coming from Edgerton and the desolated nature of the film. Then it morphs and spreads beautifully. Edgerton has some great weird vibes. Jason Bateman has this douche side to his roles sometimes. Surprisingly, he brings physicality and is believable in his strength over Edgerton. This is a terrific twist on a story that could have easily been little more than a Lifetime movie.",The Gift
3,Horst_In_Translation,"I would not call this film a gift, but still a decent watch",6,8 September 2016,"2015 was really an amazing year for actor Joel Edgerton, because he not only received lots of praise for his performance in the Johnny Depp crime film ""Black Mass"", but also wrote, directed and starred in ""The Gift"", which was his first full feature film as the man in charge behind the camera. And judging from what I saw here, I'd really love to see more films directed by the man in the future. Of course, a very personal advantage for me with this 105-minute film is that I quite like the 3 main actors here, namely Jason Bateman, the stunning Rebecca Hall and of course Edgerton himself. The only other cast member I was familiar with here is Wendell Pierce from ""The Wire"", even if he, just like everybody else, really does not have a lot of screen time at all. It is all about the lead trio and I disagree with some awards bodies here who categorize Edgerton as a supporting player. He may not be as much of a lead as the other two, but he is absolutely vital to the whole story.This is the story of a man who was a school mate of another man and enters the other man's life after 20 years and punishes him for what he did to him back then. But does he really? For a large part of the film, it is not really clear what Edgerton's exact role and motivation is. Is he just a harmless weirdo or a dangerous threat? It is all about the video we see and if he does not do what Bateman's character thinks then you could even make an argument for Bateman's character being the real villain in here. The two male protagonists are both somehow perpetrator and victim at the same time and everybody who had struggles with bullying and being accepted in his life may have sympathies with Edgerton's character here. I personally think he nails the character and so do his two co-leads. The only reason why I do not give this one an even higher rating is the script which lacked a bit for me on some occasions and I also feel it may have been a better, more essential watch without some of the scenes and at 95 minutes max. Then again, maybe Edgerton would have cut the best scenes and it would have hurt the film even more. It is pretty fine the way it is and even if I criticized the film a bit, I must still say these over 100 minutes flew by and this should not be taken for granted. I also liked that he did nothing to Hall's character at the hospital as these two always seemed to have a respectable relationship, even if she may have been creeped out by him, even if he may have done something to her earlier. We will never find out. But in terms of the story, it better fits if he didn't, even if it was never his intention to hurt her, only to hurt Bateman's character. As a whole, I certainly recommend this film to people who love tense psychological thrillers as, to that regard, you will not find many superior films from 2015. Go see it!",The Gift
4,claudio_carvalho,Good People Deserve Good Things,7,24 April 2016,"When Simon Callum (Jason Bateman) moves with his wife Robyn (Rebecca Hall) from Chicago to an astonishing house in California to work in a new job, they need to go shopping in a store. Out of the blue, a man named Gordon ""Gordo"" Moseley (Joel Edgerton) stumbles upon Simon and tells that he was a former high school classmate. Gordo overhears their address and brings gifts for the couple, making Simon uncomfortable. Then he invites the couple to have dinner with him and they learn that Gordo lives in a mansion. He receives a phone call and leaves the couple alone at his home and Simon decides to snoop around and mock him. When Gordo returns, Simon says that he should stay away from Robyn and him. There are incidents at Simon's home and the family's dog disappears and Simon blames Gordo. Simon drives to his house and he finds that Gordo does not live there. However the dog returns and the couple receive a letter of apology from Gordo telling to let bygones be bygones. Robyn is curious about the meaning but she gets pregnant. When Robyn discovers that her husband bullied Gordo in high school, she decides to research their past, discovering dreadful secrets from Simon's past. There are many problems with Simon and when the baby is born, he receives a mysterious gift from Gordo. What might be the gift?""The Gift"" is a different thriller where the bad guy is not who the viewer initially imagine. There is tension along the whole story and the conclusion is open. With the resource of DNA, Simon may come up to conclusions about the paternity of his son. But the point is that Gordo and Robyn has always had a civilized relationship and he tells her that good people deserve good things. Therefore, he probably has not raped and harmed her. But this is just an opinion. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""O Presente"" (""The Gift"")",The Gift

Simon tries to blow him off, but Gordo forces his way into his life in a very creepy fashion. As it turns out, the two have a history, that becomes a mystery that needs to be uncovered.While the film was well acted, the plot was ""low energy"" to quote a campaign phrase. I didn't feel the intensity as I never felt Gordo was a real and convincing threat. Robyn came across as a basket case by design, so her concerns became downplayed.Guide: F-bomb.

6,kosmasp,The Gift that keeps on ... and on and on,7,11 November 2016,"Obviously some formulas (or sayings) are familiar to some, but there is always some twist you can give them to make them feel a bit fresh. In this case add some really good actors into the mix and let them do their thing. Even if you kind of know where this is going (unless this is the first thriller of its kind you're about to watch and/or haven't seen the trailer yet), this can still be engaging, entertaining and keep you on the edge of your seat.Having said all that, because it's not the freshest of ideas and not the most original concept, this may disqualify it from the start for some. Don't force yourself to watch it, if you don't think you'll like it anyway. Otherwise give it a chance and stay for the ride til the end :o)",The Gift
7,Sleepin_Dragon,Simon says watch this movie.,8,12 October 2015,"Simon and Robyn relocate to their new house, whilst out shopping the pair bump into Gordon (Gordo) an old school friend of Simon's. The couple return home one day to find a bottle of wine Gordo had gifted them, he'd picked up their address. Gordo starts turning up at their house unannounced and forcing a friendship, and somehow putting a level of paranoia into Robyn. Simon had been school president, and Gordo had suffered somewhat at Simon's hand. Events soon spiral out of control and secrets of the past are unearthed by Robyn. Robyn soon becomes pregnant, a huge happiness for them both as her last pregnancy was sadly unsuccessful. Whilst Robyn is in Hospital recovering after giving birth, Simon returns home to find 'the gift' from Gordo waiting for him, the gift causes Simon to lose control.I wasn't expecting to enjoy this film as much as I did, the trailers did not do it justice. It's a thought provoking, powerful, deep and brilliantly acted thriller. It makes you alter your perceptions and opinions of the characters as it progresses, the one constant being Robyn, who's actually quite sweet, brilliantly portrayed by Rebecca Hall. Joel Edgerton does a grand job as Gordo, playing him consistently and very subtly, it could have been so easy for him to overplay his part, but he never does. I've always been a fan of Mr Bateman, and once again he proves he's not just about comedy, he's excellent, particularly at the very end.The menacing elements are subtly played, and mostly implied, it adds more to the ending. It's a great film, revenge is the main reason for Gordo's appearance, but it's kept until later on in the film.Very much worth seeing. 8/10",The Gift
8,jboothmillard,The Gift,5,18 June 2021,"It sounded like something worthwhile, and it had three good names in the cast, so I went with it, directed by Joel Edgerton (Boy Erased). Basically, married couple Simon (Jason Bateman) and Robyn Callem (Rebecca Hall) have relocated from Chicago to the Los Angeles suburbs after Simon gets a new job. While out shopping, they run into Gordon ""Gordo"" Moseley (Joel Edgerton), Simon's former high school classmate. Gordo begins repeatedly visiting them unannounced and delivering gifts, including expensive bottles of wine and fish for their pond. Simon feels tense and uncomfortable with his presence, but Robyn sees no problem. Gordo invites Simon and Robyn to dinner at his large, elegant home, along with another couple. Upon arrival, Gordo tells them that the other couple has cancelled. When Gordo receives a call, saying it is a work problem, he abruptly leaves Simon and Robyn alone in his house. Simon feels more suspicious of Gordo after he explores the house. Gordo returns and tells them that he was actually meeting with his ex-wife, they are getting divorced and are in a custody battle. Simon tells him that they are leaving and tells Gordo to stay away from them. The next day, Robyn finds the fish dead and their dog missing. Simon drives to Gordo's house to confront him, but discovers the home actually belongs to another couple. Days later, Robyn suspects she is not alone in the house while Simon is at work, seeing and hearing movement. Unable to sleep, she steals prescription pills from her friend and neighbour Lucy (Allison Tolman). That night, the dog suddenly returns, and Robyn finds a formal letter of apology from Gordo in the mail. The message ends with a note to Simon that says Gordo was ""willing to let bygones be bygones"", which relates to an event from years ago, but not anymore. When Robyn confronts Simon about what the phrase means, but he claims he does not know what it refers to. While Simon meets with his boss about a promotion, with his only competition being co-worker Danny McDonald (Final Destination 5's P. J. Byrne), Robyn's increasing paranoia while home alone causes her to faint. She wakes up in her bed the next morning and Simon confronts her in the kitchen, having found her stolen pills, she had a previous drug problem in Chicago. She asks Simon to help with her anxiety by making peace with Gordo, but he assures her Gordo is gone, telling her the pills are making her paranoid. Time passes and things improve when Robyn becomes pregnant. But whilst out shopping, Robyn sees Gordo watching her. At her baby shower, Simon's sister Joan (Katie Aselton) tells her that, back in high school, Simon and his friend Greg Pierson reported that Gordo had been molested by an older boy, which led to Gordo getting bullied and transferring schools. Robyn later searches Simon's office and discovers that he has run background checks on Danny McDonald and Gordo, who has spent his life in and out of prison. Robyn seeks out Greg (David Denman), who reveals the molestation story was false, and that Simon was a bully with a ""real mean streak."" Greg also tells her that the false report caused Gordo's father to think his son was gay and tried to burn him alive, leading to his father's arrest for attempted murder and Gordo being sent away to military school. When Robyn asks why Simon would have done such a thing, Greg replies, ""because he could."" Robyn confronts Simon about Gordo, but he denies responsibility. However, at Robyn's behest, Simon tracks down Gordo and half-heartedly apologises. Gordo does not accept his apology, recognising his insincerity, and he warns Simon that the past is not done with him yet. Furious, Simon attacks and threatens Gordo. Back at home, Simon lies to Robyn, saying that Gordo accepted his apology. Simon is promoted at his job, but his celebration party is interrupted by an angry Danny McDonald hurling rocks and shattering a window. He accuses Simon of fabricating information and ruining his career to get the promotion. After Danny is allowed to leave, Robyn goes into labour and gives birth to a boy at the hospital. The next morning, Simon is fired for lying about McDonald, and Robyn tells him that she wants to separate. Simon returns home to find another gift box on the front porch, containing a baby cradle, and inside it is three small packages. These packages are a key to their house, an audio recording of Simon and Robyn making fun of Gordo while they were left alone at his fake house, and filmed footage from inside Simon and Robyn's home of Gordo standing over Robyn when she had fainted, seemingly about to sexually assault her. Gordo also filmed himself wearing a monkey mask (monkeys being a lifelong fear for Simon) and touching an unconscious Robyn, before the camera cuts away. At the same time, Gordo is at the hospital to congratulate Robyn with a bandaged eye and his arm in a sling. He tells her that Simon caused his injuries. Simon rushes to the hospital but just misses Gordo, who smirks at him as the elevator doors close and then disappears. Gordo calls Simon to taunt him, refusing to confirm or deny whether he raped Robyn or not and is the true father of the baby, just as Simon refused to tell the truth about the molestation story all those years before. Simon finds Robyn and the baby in the hospital nursery, but she refuses to see him. With his marriage over and his career destroyed, Simon breaks down as Gordo watches through a window and walks away, tossing away the sling from his arm. Also starring Tim Griffin as Kevin ""KK"" Keelor, Beau Knapp as Detective Walker, Busy Philipps as Duffy, Wendell Pierce as Detective Mills, Mirrah Foulkes as Wendy Dale, and Nash Edgerton (Joel's brother) as Frank Dale. Bateman, often in comedic roles, proves himself a reasonably good serious actor, Hall is perfect as the innocent wife caught in the middle, and Edgerton does a fairly good job as the villain of the piece. It is a slow burner with a familiar plot, a guy who ""accidentally"" bumps into his former school chum, the friend turns out to have a dark agenda, but slowly things from the past come to light, I will be honest and say that it got a bit ridiculous at a few points, and the ending feels slightly unfinished (DNA test?), but for its tense, uncomfortable and eerie atmosphere it just about kept me gripped, not a bad psychological thriller. Worth watching!",The Gift
9,rmax304823,Social Skills.,6,14 August 2016,"It has to be admitted that Rebecca Hall is quite a woman. She could have modeled for Modigliani. She has an oval face, a long and lyrical neck, a prominent mental symphysis, and a grin full of incandescent white teeth. I need those teeth.The plot. A new middle-class couple -- Hall and Bateman -- move into a California suburb of the same town in which husband Bateman grew up. The house is stunning in its modernity Old friends from high school gather round and welcome Bateman and his wife back home.Bateman is rather successful. He is some kind of businessman at some giant concern, The Streptococcal Holding Company or whatever it is, jockeying for a promotion with only one rival for the position. He's a real hard charger. And Bateman does a pretty good job with the role. He's blandly handsome, sometimes a bit stuffy, but polite.The next afternoon, with Bateman away at the office, Joel Edgerton, one of his old high school buddies -- well, not exactly a buddy but an acquaintance -- shows up with a welcoming gift. It's a bit awkward as he stands in the door and stares around vacantly until Hall must invite him in or seem impolite. He continues to act weird. He looks weird too. When the couple are forced to have him for dinner, he uses the F word casually although nothing describes this couple better than the word ""conformist."" After the first fifteen minutes, I had it all figured out. Edgerton would become increasingly strange over time until they finally had to throw him out. Edgerton would then take offense and begin covertly assaulting the family -- stealing their dog, etc. There would have to be a final violent confrontation. The husband would be somehow disabled or otherwise unable to help. After many tense moments -- pursuits up and down staircases, into cellars and attics, a lot of panting with horror in dark corners, into attacks with improvised weapons (maybe a shard of broken glass from a mirror) that Hall uses against Edgerton but don't seem to slow him down for a moment, despite his roars of pain and fury. We've seen it dozens of times.All of the introductory minutes prepare us for the cascade of clichés, especially the cheap shot of Rebecca Hall taking a shower, all vulnerability, hearing a strange noise, wiping the steam from the glass shower stall, only to see the colossally blown-up face of -- WALDO! Please insert sting on the sound track. But of course it was only a dream, and Hall jolts upright in bed, gasping and getting the sheets all sweaty. Ho hum.But I was wrong. I was sufficiently wrong that this is one of the few movies whose ending shouldn't be given away. In fact, there are some holes in the plot, enough so that I don't think I COULD give the resolution away. I don't understand it myself. The first half is rather good in its misleading way. See it, then get back to me and let me know what it was all about.",The Gift
10,blanche-2,Fascinating,8,11 February 2017,"But I would have named it something else.Jason Bateman, Rebecca Hall, and Joel Edgerton, who wrote and directed, star in ""The Gift,"" an overlooked film from 2015. Guess everyone was too busy with the blockbusters.Bateman and Hall are Simon and Robyn, who have moved to Chicago to California for a ""fresh start."" We don't know too much about why they needed one, except that it had something to do with Robyn's miscarriage and pill- taking.Simon runs into Gordo (Edgerton) who reintroduces himself and says that he and Simon attended high school together. In the days that follow, Gordo drops by the house with gifts and invites them to dinner. It's an awkward event, with Gordo leaving in the middle of the evening to take a call. Both Robyn and Simon are uncomfortable, and When Gordo returns, Simon tells him that he needs to stay away from both of them.A few bad incidents occur at Simon and Robin's house, and Simon is sure Gordo is responsible. Simon also learns that Gordo does not live in the house where they were to have dinner. He does send them an apology letter and asks that they ""let bygones be bygones,"" which Robyn finds strange.Finally, a horrible secret from years ago emerges, and a pregnant Robyn must cope with what she learned at the same time there is a change at Simon's place of business.This is a wonderful film, a psychological drama where what seems to be going on is only part of the story. All the actors do a terrific job - Jason Bateman uses his natural delivery to good advantage here and turns in a wonderful performance. Rebecca Hall plays Robyn as a fragile and nervous woman determined to adjust to her new home and life. She's totally believable. As the awkward, odd Gordo, Joel Edgerton is excellent, coming off as sort of creepy or just weird.Highly recommended, this is a thought-provoking film.",The Gift
11,Quinoa1984,a dramatic thriller that turns the tables in a very satisfying way,8,8 August 2015,"It's hard to talk about The Gift without dipping into too many spoilers, but in the short of it, it's fairly safe to say Joel Edgerton has one of the most exciting directorial debuts in the past few years. It may not be perfect (one or two jump scares is still one or two too many, mostly in a work like this surrounding those moments), but what Edgerton shows is a a knowledge of conventions and, most crucially, the ability and skill to subvert them and make something we thought we knew about the characters into something else. It's a twisty thriller, but one in which no one, except maybe Rebecca Hall's character Robyn, comes out well by the end of it, though one has things more better off than the other.As Simon (Bateman) and Robyn move in to a suburban neighborhood, they run into - or it should be said, he happens to see the couple in a store - Gordo (Edgerton himself, and a helluva meaty role), who Simon knew back in school. Things seem pleasant in this reunion. At first. A dinner conversation makes things a little more awkward for Simon. How come? Things seem alright, Gordo may have table manners or dinner-speak that's a little off-kilter, but only in small, subtle ways. What's really going on with Simon's immediate animosity? Well, it could have to do with the 'gifts' that Gordo leaves for this couple, which Robyn sees on the doorstep when she comes home from her run. Or, when Simon rejects the friendship of Gordo, how that turns back on them (so, the gift of fish for their coy-pond, and then... the same fish turn up dead, and where's the dog?) So, ties get cut, and something still seems 'off', but now for Robyn. Especially with a letter from Gordo saying to Simon 'I wish there could've been bygones be bygones' to that effect. What does this mean? So much mystery comes up in this story, and it is always working in the sense of the psychology and mood of the characters. At first, Edgerton's set up seems like the stuff of (way above average, but still) Lifetime movie-of-the-week fodder: the best friend who stalks and terrorizes a couple, and may have the 'hots' for the wife. Will this be tawdry pot-boiler stuff, albeit shot with a great eye for pacing and waiting in those moments in the dark and quiet times for Robyn by herself? What else is there to Bateman's Simon? It's the kind of character and, in Bateman's hands, a performance that has to be done just right, where, just automatically as audiences think to usually do, the sympathies and 'side' would be on the couple equally. Simon has deprecating comments and, at first, we buy them as does Robyn. But... there's something not quite right, is there? What it turns out is that there's been a history between Simon and Gordo, and it's these secrets and lies, and the personalities of both Simon and Gordo, that make the film so immediate and compelling and truly harrowing. It's basically a three-character piece, though there are supporting players plus a sub-plot (maybe only developed so far as to make Simon look even less sympathetic) involving problems and scandal at work, and it ultimately comes down as a showdown between Simon and Gordo. Edgerton's script is extremely smart in how it turns what could be just stalker-of-a-couple junk and makes it into, well, an anti-bullying movie. Only instead of the characters being adolescents or kids or teens or whatever, it's the effects of this many years down the line, as adults. Do you hang on to it? Do you apologize? Do people stay bullies and victims their whole lives? How the tables eventually fully get turned and the dastardly deeds of Gordo happen I won't say, just as it would spoil the 'fun' of it (not that it's funny or anything, but you stay on the edge of your seat with this kind of material). And, again, Edgerton casts Bateman and Hall so well, especially Bateman, and this is the best kind of role he's played since Juno: the ordinary suburban man who may have some real demons behind his sarcastic-seemingly-friendly facade. But the assumptions work both ways, and the gray areas of the characters make it so compelling: do we completely root for one character over the other after a while? The ending is rather f***ed-up in where it leads, the implications, and the creep-factor continues till the last shot.And yet The Gift plays with conventions, of how a wife sees her husband, of how we see the stalker and the stalked, and it makes us (or at least me) question what happens with liars and when they hear the truth and/or lies in their lives. It's a slick thriller on the surface with a lot to say about the devils of human nature, of empathy and sympathy, of the concept of 'bygones be bygones'. A deceptively complex moral story in the guise of simple genre filler.",The Gift
12,edwagreen,**,4,29 July 2017,"This was certainly no gift of a picture. I found it very slow moving and we're left with the idea that when you meet someone after such a long time, it's not that great to pursue the meeting as old things will be brought up from years ago.We see the married Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall move from Chicago to California for his new business venture and a beautiful home.In a chance meeting, he comes across a fellow who he knew from high school from years back. The guy lies almost about everything and is practically stalking them and even kidnapping their dog along the way.As is the usual case, the truth eventually comes out but by then you're practically fast asleep or bored out of your mind.",The Gift
13,Coventry,"Good script, Mr. Edgerton. Bravo!",7,8 November 2020,"""Oh joy, another privacy-invasion thriller"". That was my first spontaneous thought when ""The Gift"" aired on television. I don't necessarily dislike the family-stalker concept, and it always remains somewhat unsettling and identifiable (because we all know someone we don't like but who doesn't get the subtle hints), but I've seen too many of these already and they are all quite predictable.And that's exactly how ""The Gift"" starts out, too. Clichéd and derivative with sequences you have seen plenty of times before. You basically just keep watching for the performances. I've liked Jason Bateman since the very first minute of ""Arrested Development"", and he's probably the most suitable actor in contemporary Hollywood to depict a regular guy. Rebecca Hall's role, as the docile wife Robyn, is rather bland, but she's a good actress and makes the most of it. Writer/director Joel Edgerton also cast himself as the obtrusive and self-declared ""friend of the family"" who comes with undesired gifts and unwanted household help. Edgerton, as well, hits the exact right tone, since he's uncanny but not exaggeratedly psychotic.But then something highly unusual and rarely before seen happens. The tables turn entirely. I'm not just talking about an unexpected plot twist, but a complete and fundamental change of how the viewer perceives the two lead characters. And, moreover, Edgerton's script gets away with it! Obviously, I can't (and do not want to) reveal too much about the plot's complete U-turn, but I personally found it dared, realistic, progressive and - oh yes - even a bit confronting. It's brutally honest, and it makes the film result in a sort of anti-climax, but nevertheless a very strong and thought-provoking one. The moral of the film? I guess it can most effectively be summarized with the great lyrics of the almighty Billy Joel's song ""Honesty"".Honesty is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you",The Gift
14,sunwarrior13,A Smartly Written Psychological Thriller,9,7 September 2016,"I was in the library one day and decided to once again see one of my favorite movies of all-time,""The Cider House Rules"". Another DVD came into my attention.It was ""The Gift"". Without really thinking,I decided to rent it as well together with ""The Cider House Rules"". I decided to see the Tobey Maguire-starrer at home and watched it a few more times as I was totally engrossed of the story and Michael Caine's Academy Award-winning performance.After a few more days of rental,I finally decided to view this Jason Bateman and Rachel Hall- starrer. I was surprised how wonderful this Joel Edgerton-directed- movie was and realized it was definitely in the category of the Lasse Hallestrom-directed-movie in terms of ""A Movie You Had To See"".The Gift tells a story of a young married couple,Simon and Robyn Callem,who just recently moved to Los Angeles from Chicago after Simon got another consulting job in that suburb.While in a shopping mall, both meet Gordon Moseley,who happens to be Simon's former High School classmate.Gordon,who was more known as Gordo,makes things different for the young couple in the sense that he provides them gifts and makes an effort to become a great friend towards the family.But things turn upside down later as both Simon and Robyn begin troubled by it.Later through Robyn's prodding,Simon starts trying to remember his past and finds out that Gordo has a score to settle against him due to a tragic incident in High School that changed his life forever.The relationship between the couple starts to deteriorate and Robyn starts to learn more about who her husband really is particularly the negative qualities he possessed like being a bully and someone who tries to ruin others for his sake.In the process,we get to see Gordo carries out his revenge against him from the deterioration of his career;his marriage which ultimately led to his wife leaving him;and mysteriously the identity of his new-born son.No question that this a smartly written psychological thriller that will keep the audience guessing from start to finish.Truly,it was unpredictable especially during the the third part when Gordo starts carrying out his revenge plans against Simon.As for the first and second part,it was definitely full of twists and surprises especially during the time when Simon had difficulty recalling who Gordo was after all these years since High School as well as his confusion of Gordo's true objective into becoming a part of their lives.Aside from that,we also are surprise to discover surprising character traits of Simon especially as Robin tries to learn more about her husband behind his back.For all these,I must say give credit to director Joel Edgerton for crafting a great script and how he remodeled and remixed numerous story formulas into creating something genuinely unique and truly entertaining. In summary,this was definitely a movie you had to see.",The Gift
15,preppy-3,It's good but slow,5,14 August 2015,"Simon (Jason Bateman)and Robyn (Rebecca Hall) are a married couple who have just moved to California. While shopping they run into Gordo (Joel Edgerton) an old schoolmate of Simons. Gordo is socially awkward and strange but they invite him over for dinner. Then he starts to show up all the time at the house showering them with gifts. They tell him to leave them alone...but then things turn deadly.This has been praised to the high heavens by critics. While it is a good thriller--sometimes a VERY good thriller--it's not that great. It's slow-moving and flatly directed by Edgerton. There are a lot of good twists and turns at the end and the acting is good all around but the slow pace makes this sometimes frustrating to watch. 10 minutes easily could have been removed from this. Also visually it's nothing special and the stereo soundtrack adds nothing to it either. No blood, gore or nudity either. This would play just as well on TV as up a theatre. So I slightly recommend it but don't pay full price.",The Gift

Simon bumps into someone he knew at school, 20 years ago - Gordon (Joel Edgerton). Gordon starts sending the couple gifts and starts dropping around their house unexpectedly. Initially they are happy to humour him but he is not really a friend of theirs and is a bit creepy, so they ask him to stay away from them. Gordon obliges but from his parting note Robyn thinks that there may be an incident in Simon and Gordon's schooldays that Simon doesn't want to talk about. So she starts investigating...Okay - reasonably interesting but not that great. Quite slow-moving with the promise of a great revelation and possibly some sort of revenge-motivated violence. However, the revelation isn't that extreme, certainly not as shocking or profound to warrant such a build-up of tension. Probably the biggest revelation is that you can't always judge the characters by your initial impression, but even that isn't so revolutionary.The conclusion is also a bit unsatisfactory and misguided. The revenge is bizarre and exceeds the initial offense, yet the perpetrator is made out to be a hero. Still, intriguing and engaging enough. A decent directorial debut from Joel Edgerton, who also wrote the script.",The Gift
17,oscaralbert,This brilliant expose of America's One Per Center bullies . . .,8,11 August 2015,". . . shows many of the dirty tricks and serial false witnessing that have gotten them to where they are today. Jason Bateman's ""Simon"" character has THE GIFT of amorality and a sociopath's total lack of conscience, which provides him the talent to be a plausible pathological liar. This tale makes it clear that future One Per Centers pick up THE GIFT during their childhood school days (unless they inherit it from parents also lacking human souls). No normal person is safe from anyone with THE GIFT such as Simon, who grows up ruining lives such as ""Gordon's"" on a whim (that is, ""Just for the Hell of it""), but focuses on the goal of accumulating Big Money as an adult (since that's the ""American Dream,"" and every aspect of our legal system is carefully crafted to coddle, aid, and abet predators such as Simon). As Simon's wife ""Robin"" decides by the end of this story, no riches are worth the Damnation of living with a One Per Center, and the only way for a normal soul to regain some semblance of serenity is to command, ""Simon, get behind me!"" No doubt there are many products of American schools who are failed Rich People (since, by definition, the One Per Cent umbrella leaves 99% of us out in the cold), and they do their best to cozy up to people with THE GIFT by becoming their lackeys--corrupt lawmakers, bully cops, tunnel-visioned military personnel, frightened judges, and the like. Maybe there's one or two Americans of Simon's ilk with THE GIFT who also possess ""hearts of gold""--but that possibility is pretty hard to swallow!",The Gift

Effective throw back to '80s psychological domestic thrillers with Edgerton (who directed and penned the decent screenplay) as a misfit acquaintance of a young married couple (Bateman and Hall both doing straight-laced worriment with aplomb) that escalates into darker channels of social ineptitude and perceived notions of status symbols.

19,neil-476,Solid drama from Edgerton - good work!,8,14 August 2015,"Following a work promotion, Simon and Robyn move into a flashy new home in California. Shortly afterwards, they encounter Gordon (""Gordo"") who used to go to school with Simon, although Simon barely remembers him. Then Gordo starts leaving gifts for them and working his way into their social life, making Simon deeply uneasy. After Simon severs connections with Gordo, unpleasant things start happening...The trailer tells you this, and so it goes – we find ourselves in urban paranoia land, with the expectation that we may be seeing a variation on the neighbour from hell movie, like Michael Keaton in Pacific Heights, or Samuel L Jackson in Lakeview Heights. But something else seems out of whack from early on – isn't Simon over-reacting a bit here? Gordo seems like a fairly nice guy – what does Simon have against him?As the story develops, we learn more about the story behind the story, and we are taken in some quite unexpected directions. Jason Bateman's easy amiability is used well, but I think credit must go to Joel Edgerton: not because Gordo is an acting tour de force (it's a perfectly good performance, but you're not going to go home thinking, ""Wow! Oscar time!""), but because he wrote and directed this, and discharged both functions with excellence. The slow build of uneasiness and the constant build of misleading elements are very well done, and the ending was particularly pleasing.This is not a horror film – a nice bit of misdirection in the trailer – but it is a very effective drama.",The Gift
20,evanston_dad,Stalker Thriller Just Misses Being Really Good,6,3 January 2016,"Joel Edgerton directed and stars in this stalker thriller, and the results, while uneven, show quite a bit of promise in Edgerton's skills as a director.Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall play a newly-transplanted married couple who reconnect with an old high school classmate of Bateman's (Edgerton). His appearance in this couple's life brings to light some uncomfortable secrets about Bateman that make his wife, already on shaky ground with him and their marriage, question everything upon which she has so far laid the foundation of her life.The film suffers from a bit of identity crisis. It goes beyond the standard stalker formula to something more complicated and compelling. It's never clear exactly how dangerous Edgerton's character is, and there's a tipping point in the movie after which Bateman -- who can play cocky jerk like nobody's business -- becomes the film's true villain, and the dynamic between him and Hall and their toxic marriage becomes much more interesting than the stalker plot line. But the film can't quite commit to letting the stalker plot line go entirely, so it becomes a sort of diluted side plot that works toward a hard sell ending that doesn't feel right for the kind of movie preceding it. I can't help but think how much more interesting the movie would have been had Edgerton's character never actually been a threat at all, and instead became a sort of physical manifestation of Bateman's and Hall's mutual dysfunction. But then of course it would have been a completely different movie.""The Gift"" is an almost perfect example of a solid B movie. There's nothing outright bad about it or wrong with it, but it's also missing those intangible qualities that would have made it really good.Grade: B",The Gift
21,AlsExGal,more of a moralistic drama than a jump-scare chiller,7,5 February 2021,"Australian actor Joel Edgerton wrote, produced and directed this drama with thriller elements,. Rebecca Hall and Jason Bateman star as a married couple newly moved to Los Angeles. They run into a old high school classmate of Bateman's (Edgerton) who seems desperate to restart a friendship that Bateman can't remember them having. Hall begins to suspect that something isn't right with Edgerton and that her husband isn't telling the whole truth about their past.This has all of the trappings of one of those late-80's ""yuppie nightmare"" thrillers that glutted the market for about eight years, with the upscale settings and work environments of the characters getting upset by a malignant outside force, a situation that draws the worst out of the victims. Bateman is clever casting, as he's one of the best actors in his age range at portraying borderline nice-at-heart-or-really-a-jerk characters, which here keeps the audience guessing. Edgerton is normally a very physical actor, but here he's reserved and quiet. Hall is very good as the woman at the center of this odd dynamic, and she has her own past issues to deal with. I think audiences going into this expecting a rollercoaster-ride thriller will be disappointed, and while I don't want to spoil where things go, I think it's advisable to let viewers know that this is more of a moralistic drama than a jump-scare chiller.",The Gift
22,ferguson-6,High School Reckoning,7,9 August 2015,"Greetings again from the darkness. Joel Edgerton has become one of the more interesting actors working today. His projects range from indies like Warrior and Animal Kingdom to award winners like Zero Dark Thirty and big budget releases like The Great Gatsby. He has written screenplays, and now comes his feature length directorial debut  and an impressive debut it is.Simon (Jason Bateman) and Robyn (Rebecca Hall) are seeking a fresh start as they relocate to Los Angeles from Chicago. A new house and new job are an attempt to put an unfortunate situation regarding an unborn child behind them. Things get off to a great start for them as they buy a beautiful house, and Simon is put up for a promotion. An encounter with Gordo (played by Edgerton) leads to some awkward social interactions and some downright creepy stalking.The film will work best the less you know about it. The psychological thriller aspects never devolve into the slashfest we have come to expect. Instead the film blurs the lines between good guys and bad guys. In fact, it brings into debate what makes a good person  it even states ""you may be through with the past, but the past isn't through with you"". Do our past misdeeds ever totally fade? What about high school bullies  do they mature? Can the proverbial zebra change its stripes? All of these questions and themes are touched.While you may struggle to identify the protagonist and antagonist, the performances of both Edgerton and Bateman are fun to watch. And it's Ms. Hall who is the grounding force who initially trusts both men, before questioning everything. There is also a very nice, understated performance from Allison Tolman as an understanding neighbor. Ms. Tolman was terrific in the first year of the ""Fargo"" series.Don't allow anyone to tell you much about this before you see it  just know that it will remind you of the importance of the Golden Rule. Treat others how you would like to be treated  or know that bygones are never bygones.",The Gift

With been impressed by his scripts for The Rover and the Aussie Noir movie The Square ,I decided that it was time to open Joel Edgerton's directing debut gift.The plot:After he gets a new job,Simon Callum and his wife Robyn move to a new location.Whilst out buying some new furniture,Simon and Robyn run into Gordon ""Gordo"" Mosle,who used to go to school with Simon.Picking up their address details from Robyn,Mosle begins to send the couple classy gifts.Whilst Robyn is grateful for the gifts,Simon makes sure that everyone knows that he wants Mosle out of their lives right now.Surprised about her husband's reaction,Robyn begins to investigate about what happened between Simon & Mosle at school.View on the film:For his directing debut,co-star/writer/director Joel Edgerton (whose brother Nash also appears) & cinematographer Eduard Grau slide across windows which stylishly shows the couple not seeing the reflections from Mosle's murky past in the gifts.Unwrapping the secrets between Mosle and Simon,Edgerton displays a sharp eye for making the corners of the screen the main focus,as Mosle moves from the side lines to being at the centre of the Callum's lives.Wrapping the Callum's with a ""perfect"" yuppie appearance,the screenplay Edgerton picks up his Neo-Noir past,as Edgerton peels away the pristine/quirky images of Simon and Mosle to reveal two men whose dark shadows of the past tower above them. Initially giving hints of Mosle being a nutter from a psycho-Thriller,Edgerton reveals remarkable restrain in not going for the quick thrill,with Edgerton instead making the psycho-thrills come from the blunt psychological impact that Mosle has on the Callum's yuppie relationship,which leads to a peculiar,rather odd final gift.Placed between the 2 guys,the very pretty Rebecca Hall gives a terrific performance as Robyn,with Hall toughening up Robyn's laid- back attitude,as Robyn begins to suspect that Simon & Mosle are keeping something hidden from her. Retaining his comedic bite, Jason Bateman does very well at giving Simon a harsh acid tongue,as every off the cuff remark that Simon gives to his wife and Mosle sounding like he is about to spit in their face.Along with all his behind the scenes work, Joel Edgerton gives a great performance as Mosle,who is given a quiet,unassuming appearance by Edgerton,which is gradually ripped apart to unveil a quick-witted sociopath,who was created from the gift that Simon gave him.",The Gift

Byrne: Tense thriller directed by Joel Edgerton about realization. In this case the theme is bullying and its scars. Jason Bateman plays Simon Callen who moves back to his home town with a promotion well in hand. Rebecca Hall plays his wife Robyn who works as a designer from home after a miscarriage. Central plot regards Joel Edgerton as former classmate Gordon Moseley who encounters the couple in what will become a series of awkward meetings. Apparently Gordon was a victim of serious bullying back in school, being called Gordo the Weirdo. It isn't long before these encounters are ceased but Robyn senses that her husband may be guilty of being responsible for whatever trauma stirs in Gordon from those high school days. Edgerton as a first time director does a fine job tensing the situation as a series of occurrences toy with Robyn's senses. Hall is the film's sympathetic centre as she learns that her husband's methods of merging ahead are at the expense of others. Bateman and Edgerton seem to switch roles as protagonist and antagonist. Bateman's Simon has his past revealed and true colours exploited, while Edgerton as Gordon is creepy yet troubled from a past that cost him. Others roles are either brief or not as developed as they should be although P.J. Byrne makes an frantic cameo as one of Simon's victims. Well written thriller that doesn't exactly reconcile the situation but lessons are learned in the blunt form of past decisions that can affect others as well as have dire costs to our comfortable lifestyle.

25,FlashCallahan,Nice fish........,6,18 October 2015,"When married couple Simon and Robyn unexpectedly encounter Gordo, an acquaintance from Simon's past, little do they know that their perfect lives will be thrown into a terrifying tailspin. At first, Simon doesn't recognise Gordo, but after a troubling series of uninvited encounters and mysterious gifts, a secret emerges. As Robyn learns what really happened between Simon and Gordo, she begins to question how well she knows her spouse...........It's really difficult not to go into a film that has had wonderful reviews, with such high expectations, and despite the fact that Edgerton has made a wonderfully sympathetic protagonist in Gordo, the writer/director/star of the film forgets one fundamental element that is pivotal in a thriller...........the element of surprise.From the moment Gordo leaves his house while he is entertaining Simon and Robyn, you can see what is coming a mile off, so the ending is more of a 'finally......I told you', more than a 'blimey, that's pretty shocking'.But the characterisation is superb, and it's really clever just how personalities switch during the second act, and who becomes more of threat toward the end.It's good to see Bateman in a different role, rather than that of a comedic buffoon, and Edgerton can do empathic sinister, but he looks so much like David Brent, it deters you from the film.So all in all, it's a pretty good character study, but it spoon feeds you it's secrets.",The Gift
26,phd_travel,An original and plausible thriller - a must watch!,10,25 September 2016,What a treat this thriller turned out to be. At first I didn't think it would be great. I wasn't a great fan of Joel Edgerton as an actor - he seemed miscast in Gatsby - but as a writer director he does a terrific job. It's not easy coming up with a thriller with a good twist - audiences have become so jaded. A couple move to LA and he bumps into an old classmate. I won't give away the plot because it's so good you have to watch this.Rebecca Hall looks ungainly but this isn't a romantic role. So she is okay if taller than Jason Bateman. Jason is usually a comic actor and it's interesting to see him play this dramatic role. Not bad.The story is original and satisfying. It starts off like a fatal attraction classmate thing but things change. It's hard to praise this movie without discussing the twist but let's just say things aren't that obvious. I like that things didn't get implausible because this movie avoids needless red herrings and cheap violence and shock tactics. Everything is more effective because it's kept believable.If you are just flipping channels on cable and come across this watch it!,The Gift
27,gradyharp,"'See, you're done with the past, but the past is not done with you.'",10,22 November 2015,"Australian Joel Edgerton is an exceptionally talented man – he is highly regarded as an actor, a writer, and director – and he brings all three of those talents to the screen in this psychological thriller THE GIFT. The dialogue is exceptionally fine, the pacing is excellent and the manner in which the story unfolds holds many surprises as well as a number of fine lessons in interpersonal responses. Simon (Jason Bateman – so fine to see him step away from the line of brainless comedies in which he was type cast!), and Robyn (Rebecca Hall) are a young married couple whose life is going just as planned until a chance encounter with an acquaintance from Simon's high school sends their world into a harrowing tailspin. Simon doesn't recognize Gordo (Joel Edgerton) at first, but after a series of uninvited encounters and mysterious gifts prove troubling, a horrifying secret from the past is uncovered after more than 20 years. As Robyn learns the unsettling truth about what happened between Simon and Gordo, she starts to question: how well do we really know the people closest to us, and are past bygones ever really bygones?This is a smart, sophisticated film, beautifully photographed by Eduard Grau and with a musical score by Danny Bensi and Saunder Jurriaans that maintains the suspense. The cast – the three leads as well as the supporting roles - is outstanding. This is a movie that is far better than the usual thriller. Highly Recommended.",The Gift
28,zetes,"Good, but I didn't quite like some of the twists",7,16 August 2015,"Pretty good thriller directed by the multi-talented actor Joel Edgerton. Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall play a married couple who move back near where Bateman grew up for his new job. There they run into a former high school classmate of Bateman's, played by Edgerton. They were not friends back then - there's clearly some bad history between the two men which Bateman is not entirely open with with his wife - but Edgerton seems friendly enough. But tensions rise when Bateman wants Edgerton to stay out of their lives. This seemed like it would be quite predictable from the trailers, but it has some good tricks up its sleeve. The strongest part of the film is the characterizations - these really feel like three dimensional people (it is unfortunate that good actresses like Alison Tolman and Busy Philipps appear in a couple of thankless supporting roles, but no big deal), and the three leads give performances to match the good script. I did think that some of the final twists didn't quite work, but it's still a solid movie.",The Gift

You can feel the tension because you know something is about to happen. And as the story goes on it gets better and better. I thought the end was just great. I didn't see it coming and that's how I like it when I watch mystery/thrillers. The main actors Jason Bateman, Rebecca Hall and Joel Edgerton did a great job to make The Gift a movie that will keep your attention for the whole duration of the movie. It's an intriguing movie with a couple of good twists. The sound effects are perfect to build up the tension in some scenes. I don't think a lot of people will dislike this movie.

33,StevePulaski,A taut thriller that never becomes too theatrical for its own good,9,7 August 2015,"The only more underserved genre for moviegoers besides serious adult comedies/dramas or immersing fantasies are the classic thriller. The last truly marvelous, slick thriller that graced multiplexes nationwide was ""Prisoners,"" an unnerving mystery revolving around the kidnapping of two young girls, with one father going to desperate lengths to find them. Since then, marginally passable films like ""No Good Deed"" have stumbled into theaters but never left the kind of imprint on audiences that has them genuinely consumed with fear and uncertainty thanks to the slickness of a film.Joel Edgerton's directorial debut ""The Gift"" is the first thriller that will leave an imprint on its viewers in a long time for more reasons than its rich cinematography and expertly paced narrative. It's the kind of film that gets one to look introspectively at the wrongs they've committed, in this case, in school, where perhaps a rumor you helped spread, or even started, went on to scar the victim for life. Perhaps if you helped spread said rumor, you've moved on, but what if the person you hurt hasn't forgotten the pain and torment your little white lie caused? ""The Gift"" examines the idea of an unburied hatchet by focusing on the young married couple of Simon and Robyn (Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall). They've just moved into a beautiful, spacious home, with Simon finding tremendous success with the company he works for and Robyn coming to terms with her anxiety and her addiction to prescription medication. Hoping to start life a new, they are thrown for a loop when they meet a man named Gordon (nicknamed ""Gordo,"" played by Edgerton) at a home-appliance store. Gordo is an old classmate of Simon, who barely recognizes him, yet still, upon even a brief conversation, recalls he's still four tires short of a car.Gordo repeatedly makes kind, yet invasive gestures towards Simon and Robyn, delivering wine, bringing fishes to fill their small pond out front, and stopping by while Robyn is home alone to keep her company. While Robyn sees a sensitive, somewhat lost soul in Gordo, Simon sees nothing but a creep - a persistent creep that has something to prove or uncover about him that Simon doesn't want revealed. Eventually, when Gordo's actions turn particularly personal and an apology on his part is warranted, Simon and Robyn receive a letter asking for ""bygones to be bygones"" for something that occurred in the past, to which only Robyn is left clueless.The performances here are unanimously strong, particularly from Bateman, who gives one of his only very serious roles to date here. Bateman even delivers a powerful monologue before his costar, Hall, who also does some good work as a troubled woman simply wanting peace of mind, concerning the ""winners and losers"" of America and how people are only held back by personal insecurities and events of the past because they choose to be. His delivery and conviction here is very strong, as he deadlocks his eyes into Hall and digs into her, himself, and everything that occurred in the past in one great scene.Edgerton, however, has the real challenging role - playing a guy who can look sweet and nimble, almost neighborly, but also a bit off and maybe even a little unstable. Edgerton's blank facial expressions find ways to be amiable, despite his behavior being increasingly troubling, almost too kind, and the character he creates for himself is one you struggle to find exactly what's bad about him when ""too nice"" doesn't seem to cut it.Yet Edgerton's craft here is something to really marvel at. Serving as the writer, director, and co-producer, ""The Gift"" is essentially his playground and, in turn, he creates a thrilling funhouse of Hitchcockian principles and truly absorbing fear. Drenched in dingy, saturated cinematography, casting a moody light on nearly every scene, ""The Gift""'s atmosphere (thanks to cinematographer Eduard Grau) is a richly detailed one. The eeriness is very even and understated, and the fright aspect sneaks up on you like the potentially deeper meaning of a kind neighbor's gesture. This is a beautiful film in terms of its look and feel, constantly feeling like its toying with your emotions.Finally, there's the narrative structure, which is very unlike Hollywood. Unlike more conventional thrillers, like ""No Good Deed,"" ""The Gift"" doesn't really have that incredulous, explosive moment, where everything you thought wouldn't happen does and the plausibility gets sacrificed for theatrics. Sure, there are some great twists, including one that goes further than I ever expected this film to go, but never is there that one moment where every ostensibly implausible thing occurs that effectively derails the entire project in terms of tone and pacing. ""The Gift"" remains consistent in creating a feeling of dread, even when the tables turn and the protagonist and antagonist lines are blurred.At the end of the day, however, Edgerton is the real star here. Proving himself a competent do-all man and not just a gimmicky actor-turned-director, he molds ""The Gift"" to his liking and asserts himself not only as a strong lover of thrillers and Hitchcockian principles but an actor who can also say, ""sit back and watch"" when he goes to do something and actually do it correctly.",The Gift
34,lasttimeisaw,"I guess, future projects are in the offing for this promising new director",7,4 November 2015,"What happened between Simon (Bateman) Gordon (Edgerton) when they were in the high school? Is the ultimate bait propelling this thriller, a foray for Aussie Joel Edgerton to grab the director's chair for the first time, who also becomes a latest triple-threat by taking the writer's credit under his belt.Simon and his wife Robyn (Hall), relocate to suburban L.A. for his new job from Chicago (after a miscarriage accident which strains their relationship) and expect a fresh start here to create a family. One day they bump into Simon's high-school classmate Gordon, whom Simon cannot recognise at the first place (which cleverly leads viewers to put a question mark on Gordon's suspicious identity, is he the real Gordon?). Then later, Gordon's uninvited visits and over- frequent gift-offering gestures, all impart an inauspicious atmosphere thanks to Edgerton's restrained manoeuvring of the common thriller clichés (only one jump-scare scene and not blood-shedding gore intended), to establish the socially awkward Gordon as a perpetrator with a sinister plan.At the same time, Simon and Robyn begin to take a different stand, Simon formally gives an ultimatum to ask Gordon to leave them alone, but an ensuing apology letter from Gordon triggers Robyn's suspicion, ""let bygones be bygones"", what happened in the past between Simon and Gordon? With Simon's utter denial, a perturbed Robyn starts to dig the truth by herself, through Simon's sister and other schoolmate, she discovers the unpleasant past of her husband, and the damage he has caused to Gordon. She urges Simon to pledge forgiveness from Gordon, but once a bully, always a bully, Simon's remorseless aggression only makes things worse, eventually Gordon's calculated tit-for-tat will pull off a satisfactory reprisal to teach all the callous bullies a hard-learned lesson.Edgerton has done a solid job, in all three aspects, THE GIFT confidently toys with the middle- class suburbia, lashes out at the corrupted morality in the American society of its bullying canker and partisan winner-or-loser dichotomy, challenges expectation in a compelling fashion and crowns the film with a reasonable finale, which elevates itself a niche above the standard criteria of the genre. Three leads are well-cast, Hall particularly, embodies her angelic virtues with substantial appeal. There is little wonder that THE GIFT is a dark-horse in the Northern American this year, tells an instructive allegory with lucid leverage and not indulgent in stock genre tropes to achieve shock value. I guess, future projects are in the offing for this promising new director.",The Gift

And the victim is dislikable and is a jerk that only cares about himself and talks a lot of crap behind their backs. I just don't like people like that. It seems that Jason Bateman is getting the most credit in this film as an actor. But I thought he is playing a character that he usually plays, except more serious since this movie is not a comedy. In another words a arrogant guy that thinks everyone is pretentious and looks down on people for their differences. But his acting really fits the character, the other actors did a pretty good job as well. Isn't anything stand out, but it fits the characters. This is a pretty good thriller not great but very watchable. It isn't a film I would watch again, but I thought it's a good thriller with good acting.

After he is shunned by the couple, he gradually taunts the husband and unleashes a secret about him that threatens their marriage.The plot is pretty fast-paced from start to finish, as the film grabs your attention almost immediately - from the appearance of awkward Gordo (Joel Edgerton) to the mind games he plays with Simon (Jason Bateman), with Simon's wife Robyn (Rebecca Hall) caught in the middle of it all.The acting, though, was a little off as I thought some of the emotions were campy and the American accents by the Australian actors were forced. The acting also didn't flow very well and the chemistry between the character leads were pretty artificial and the character development was weak.Overall, though, it's not too bad of a thriller. It does get your mind think and does surprise you in several instances.Grade B-",The Gift
38,sddavis63,Suspenseful And With A Really Good Twist,8,22 April 2016,"I honestly wasn't too sure what to expect from this movie, but it turned out to be one of the better suspense/thriller type movies I've seen in a long time. It doesn't have a big-name, star-studded cast. The best known name (for me at least) was probably Jason Bateman, but that just proves that good acting doesn't have to come from the mega- stars. All the performances in this were excellent, and the story was complex and interesting.Bateman played Simon, and Rebecca Hall was his wife Robyn. One day in a store, they unexpectedly encounter Gordo (Joel Edgerton) - a former schoolmate of Simon, whom Simon claims to barely remember. Edgerton does a fine job as Gordo. Gordo comes across as obsessed with Simon and Robyn. He latches on to them, pushing his way into their lives. He seems unbalanced. It's impossible to know when and where he's going to show up. As Simon notices, he seems especially interested in Robyn. Simon tells everyone that back in high school, Gordo was known as ""Weirdo."" Gordo's actually a pretty nerve- wracking character, and there are more than a few suspenseful moments along the way as we follow him, wondering what he's going to do.And there is a really good twist in this - the extent of which I did not see coming, even for a moment. Gordo is weird. There's no doubt about that. But Simon isn't as innocent as he first seems either, and along the way we learn a lot about Simon's past, the nature of his relationship with Gordo back in high school and the fact that he hasn't really changed all that much over the years either. By the time the movie ends, while Gordo is still a strange character, we understand his motives a lot better and watch as Simon and Robyn's previously happy marriage and successful life crumbles under a cacophony of lies.Edgerton also wrote and directed this movie, and proved to be quite adept at both, crafting a very suspenseful story and putting together a movie that was compelling and interesting.

39,Hellmant,"Keeps you guessing, all the way until the very end!",8,12 August 2015,"'THE GIFT': Four Stars (Out of Five)A psychological thriller film written, produced, and directed by Joel Edgerton (in his feature film directorial debut). Edgerton also costars in the movie, with Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall. It tells the story of a married couple, who keeps getting unwanted visits, and gifts, from an old high school acquaintance of the husband's. The film is a classic suspense thriller; that keeps you guessing, all the way until the very end!Simon (Bateman) and Robyn (Hall) are a young married couple, that just moved from Chicago to California. They seem happy, but Robyn just suffered a miscarriage; and the couple is looking to start over; away from the big city life. They've also moved, to a part of town, near where Simon grew up; and they run into an old high school classmate (of Simon's), while shopping at the store, named Gordo (Edgerton). Simon doesn't remember Gordo, at first, but he quickly remembers how weird, and bullied, he used to be. Gordo keeps coming by their new home, uninvited and bringing gifts. Things go from awkward, to haunting and disturbing; as Gordo won't seem to leave them alone. I've been a fan or Edgerton's acting since 2011's 'WARRIOR' (my favorite movie of that year); I've also enjoyed multiple films co- written by him too (like last year's 'THE ROVER'). Now, I'm happy to see, he's a gifted director as well. He says one of his main inspirations, for this movie, was Alfred Hitchcock; and I think he does a great job, paying him homage. He also gives a great, creepy performance, in the film too; and Bateman and Hall are fantastic as well (I love seeing Bateman continue to stretch as an actor, doing more dramas and thrillers). The movie is definitely worth a watch; it's a more than impressive directorial debut, from Edgerton! Can't wait to see what he does next.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/a2oJP7OqaOg",The Gift

41,Robert_duder,A total gem in a missing genre,9,16 August 2015,"I had watched one trailer for The Gift and thought it looked interesting. Well to underplay it...it was! This is probably the best thriller I have seen since 2013's Side Effects. The thriller genre is certainly not what it used to be. When The Gift started and for the first half of the film I thought to myself how good this was for a formulaic (and I mean that in a good way) thriller. The recipe for this genre is tried and true and when its done right, it can really be great. I think its hard to surprise people nowadays with a good twist because news travels fast. The Gift is truly a gem because its slow burning with fascinating performances and it really does send you through a gambit of emotions. Honestly I wondered at times if the performances were so-so or if they were really great because there subtlety to how the story unfolded. The ending seems very abrupt but when you think about you begin to understand how perfect it was. This is a thriller about vengeance, about righting a wrong and moral compass. The thing that makes or breaks a thriller to me is are you still thinking about it later? I am! And its fascinating.Jason Bateman is known for his comedy of course but he always plays the straight man. He does ""serious"" comedy extremely well. He is probably the world's best straight man. His sarcasm works so well in the scripts he chooses. However, I've also found that he's treading on over-saturating the market with his ""usual"" roles so I'm thrilled that he took this on. At first I thought he was far too bland. It seemed like something was just off and maybe he didn't fit the character. Now in retrospect, I think that was entirely the point. I think he played the character perfectly and his personality was right for this role. Rebecca Hall really shines in this role as his beloved wife recovering from emotional trauma and trying to put her life together. She really is the focus of the film and she carries it well. You feel for her and her character is very sensitive and you know there is a back story there that you have to piece together throughout the film. Joel Edgerton really outdoes himself here as he writes, directs and co-stars in the film. His performance of ""Gordo"" is not unlike Bateman's character. There is something distinctly awkward and off about him and at first you wonder if its that he doesn't fit the role and then things start to fall into place. This film gets under your skin and part of that is watching these characters and feeling like something is off.The Gift's entire premise is an ""elephant in the room."" What I mean is this film makes you feel like you're in a room with people and you know there is tension...you know there is something they are all not saying or feeling and you have no idea what it is. In that sense, The Gift is Hitchcock-ian and that is rare to find something like that. The film does surprise you, it had some terrific twists and even when the story starts to unfold, your mind is racing as to what is happening. Its not a complex story at all which is part of its brilliance. Its simply that you cannot stop watching...you are riveted to the screen. The Gift, much like many Hitchcock films, would make a great stage play because its a cat and mouse game that has great pacing. Edgerton for a first time director is brilliant. There is something sad, forlorn, brooding about the setting and their home and the characters. I think this is a film that will grow even more on me and I'll be recommending to many just as I did with 2013's Side Effects. It will be underrated I am certain but don't let this one slip past you. This is actually a brilliantly made and written film that should be heralded as something a little different in the summer. 9/10",The Gift

Human beings may not be gorillas, but there may still be certain parallels between us and our ape kindred, as attested by the fact that on one hand the sucessful can afford to be (though are not always) pleasant and generous, but on the other hand, truly nice guys finish last. In Joel Eggerton's film a male executive has a good job, a new house and a loving wife; but is threatened by the threat that his past will be exposed by a former schoolmate who inconveniently reappears in his life. The film is structured quite like a play, but is still quite engaging, although it ends with a few minor histrionics that don't quite fit the overall tone, and it's refusal to take sides, even at the end, is distancing. But I liked the ideas that it explores, and its conviction that our pasts make us what we are.",The Gift
43,bowmanblue,Beware of Joel Edgertons bearing gifts,7,27 April 2016,"'The Gift' isn't exactly a new premise – a slightly sinister man starts harassing a nice, middle-class couple and taking things just a little too far, however, don't let its lack of originality put you off. It's actually pretty fun – if your idea of fun is 'dark and disturbing.' Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall play the married couple, but it's Joel Edgerton who's the real star, not just because he plays the part of creepy and disturbed to a tee, but also because he wrote and directed the film, too. One day, Mr and Mrs average are shopping in a store, when they bump into an old 'friend' – however, it turns out that they don't really want to be friends with him any more (giving away the reasons would be classed as 'spoilers') and pretty quickly decide to give him the Facebook equivalent of 'ignoring' him. However, he's not one to just slip quietly into the night.It may sound like it's just your average 'stalker' film, but there's more to it than that. Without wishing to give anything away, it's not just Joel Edgerton who has a dark side and all is not what it seems.It's not a fast-paced movie and its runtime is closer to two hours than the average one and a half. However, it does go pretty quickly and builds tension well, keeping you guessing as to various characters' motives and what exactly they plan on doing about them.Don't go expecting a thriller – it's more a dark, drama with a lot of tense, creepy moments. If you feel like something a little deeper than your average stalker/slasher movie, then this one should fill nearly two hours of your life quite nicely and still give you something to talk about afterwards.",The Gift
44,dromasca,weirdo!,7,24 October 2015,"Joel Edgerton is not a completely anonymous actor, but not a big star either. We know his face from a few supporting roles in a number of movies, but none of them really made it to the Academy Awards. This makes even more remarkable the fact that with The Gift he is completely in control. The resulting movie is packaged as a psychological thriller set in that part of California populated with apparently happy couples or families enjoying the good life ensured by their success of their corporate careers. Yet, not everybody succeeded as well, and happy facades can hide unhappy relations and dark secrets surfacing from the past.A game is played during all this film between the director-script author and the viewers. It starts like a yuppies-go-to-California film, and a seemingly incidental encounter between the successful Simon (played by Jason Bateman) and a former school colleague called Gordo (Edgerton) who does not seem to have done that well. A feeling of un-easiness starts to install in a very subtle manner. It's not only what happens on screen (although the visits and the small gifts and favors made to Simon and to his attractive but fragile wife Robyn (Rebecca Hall) start to look more and more like stalking, but also the simple dialogs of the couples seem to indicate that not all is pink and bright in paradise. As the story continues we start to discover more details about the past, the angle and judgment on the characters changes, and the feeling of uneasiness increases. To put it in one of the words used by Simon to describe his ex-colleague – weirdo! Actors-directors are said not to be too successful in directing themselves,but Joel Edgerton is the exception. He is actually the best designed character in a triangle in which all three actors play crisply defined characters, which succeed to be true even as the perspective and the judgment of the viewers about them changes. Hitchcock is the obvious source of inspiration for the movies in this genre, and if Rebecca Hall was a blonde she would have made a perfect Hitchcockian character (Edgerton cannot even avoid filming not one but two shower scenes).There is not much violence on screen, certainly not on the scale of the 2015 violence in movies, but the feeling of terror is present almost all the time, and its remarkable that it results from psychology rather than from effects. The ending is somehow disappointing in its making, but it includes enough dose of macabre and weirdness and it's open enough to let us wonder what really happened. 'The Gift' is not easy or pleasant viewing, but it gives enough reasons of satisfaction to be worth spending the time with it.",The Gift
45,ThomasDrufke,Let Bygones be Bygones,8,9 August 2015,"There are plenty of thrillers that have plenty of promise but fail to come through in their execution. The Gift is just the opposite. The trailers were really well done and pretty much all the marketing for the film was handled extremely well. Apparently the studio sent out 'Gifts' to plenty of critics and media personnel well in advance in an attempt to stir up the buzz for the film. It worked because my theater was packed on a Sunday at 2pm. I was taken aback by the amount of people. You just don't see that unless it's a big summer blockbuster. So it's safe to say they got people to go see the film. Now did they execute in the making of the film? Absolutely.The Gift is a thriller in every sense of the word. It tells the story of Simon and his wife who recently move out to California in order to get away from past personal troubles, but ironically Simon's past finds him. Gordo, an old classmate of Simon's, runs into them and doesn't let bygones be bygones. Several gifts show up at the couples house day after day and chaos ensues. And it's not completely an original film, in fact several clichés are used. But I thought the execution and the building of tension throughout was meticulous crafted. Especially the music done by Danny Bensi which contributed to said tension a lot. This is Joel Edgerton's directorial debut and boy did it make an impression on me. He is simply one of my favorite people in the business. After Warrior, Gatsby, and Zero Dark Thirty he was already in the list of my favorite actors, and his performance is great here too. But it was the simplicity of his directing job that I felt was most impressive. He got one of Rebecca Hall's best performances out of her and I don't think Jason Bateman has ever been better.But like I said before, it wouldn't be a great thriller if the writing of the inevitable twist or climax wasn't done well. There was about a 15 minute interval near the end that the film almost lost me, but it picked back up and the final minutes are tremendous. The great part was that I was far more interested in the arcs of each individual character than I was of the reveal or anything else. It's a tribute to the great character development that Edgerton did. Now, I could have probably done without the friends of the couple in the film as I don't think they really had a purpose, or at least I didn't need them. There are also quite a few things either left up to interpretation or just not addressed, which some may have a gripe with, but I thought it worked to it's benefit. The film already had a pretty decent length as at times I felt the 2 hour runtime, but it's a really enjoyable psychological thriller. I was really pleased with this film, because we don't see many of these films anymore, or at least good ones for that matter.+Character arcs +Rebecca Hall steals the show +Music +Executed the clichés well +Ending -Supporting characters 8.7/10",The Gift

It all works out splendidly and by not giving the straight answers at the end Joel Edgerton leaves and open interpretation ending. This is a very good movie.",The Gift
50,ironhorse_iv,I like this gift. What a wonderful suspenseful thriller!,8,18 November 2015,"There is a lot of movies that share the same title as this movie. However, not all of them, has that great 'Hitchcockian', feel to it; like this film. When it comes to psychological thrillers; the Gift is wickedly smart and playfully subversive, challenging the audience's expectations while leaving them leaning on the edges of their seats. It remind me, so much, like 2003's Old Boy. Both films, are truly lovely gifted. The movie tells the story of a newly married couple's lives, being thrown into harrowing tailspin when an old schoolmate acquaintance of their, Gordon ""Gordo"" Moseley (Joel Edgerton) comes for a visit. While, the husband, Simon Callum (Jason Bateman) see this visit as an intrudement. His wife, Robyn (Rebecca Hall) believes that Gordon's visit, has awoken a dark curiosity inside her, willing to figure out, her husband's mysterious past. Can both of them, find a positive way to deal with Gordon's every commanding presence or will they find themselves, slowly drifting apart, when more and more detail of Gordon's past, become more and more apparent? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, this movie written by first time director, Joel Edgerton offers a new unique take on the frequently over-used ""psychotic intruder"" formula. The twist and turns, convey the cleverness, and uneasiness flow of the film, very well. I have to say, it's one of the most entertaining well-done stories, I have saw this year. Much praise to everybody that work on this film. Very gifted talents. The actors in this film, really hit their stride. Joel Edgerton was very good in the creepiness role, he has taken, here. You really see the vulnerability, within his character. It's so different from, his normal other roles, where he play 'Übermensch' type men. Jason Bateman in the other hand, is also exploring new grounds in his career, with this dramatic role. Known best for his comedy, Bateman really does push the boundaries of what's positive and negatively in the department of being self-driven. He really could seem like a big bully. You get a sense of Saul Bellow's Humboldt's Gift within this role. Serving as commentary on the increasing commodification of the culture of fear within the 21th century. As well, as the fight or flight concepts that build America, from social awkwardly to mainstream leader within the world's social hierarchy. If Gordon's represent, the ugly side of socialism. Then, Simon is the ugly side, when it comes to capitalism. I love the Aesop message, presented here. Be careful how you treat people, because you don't know, what will happen, if you don't. Also, despite- being the weakest character within the film, and looking like a carbon copy of Anne Hathaway, Rebecca Hall was OK as the emotional confused and drain, young woman, trying to rebuilt her life, after a miscarriage, and years of postpartum depression. Her backstory was a bit missing from the main plot, however, I like that she was the driven force, even if her curiously for Gordon seem a bit, unrealistic and out of character. I have to say, the movie is wonderfully shot, very well. The way, the camera moves from screen to screen in a voyeurism type way, helps further blurring the moral distinction between the innocent and the guilty. It really makes the normally, mundane house-hold errands, so much, intense than it has to. I like how the movie, doesn't cheaply over-used, scary music or jump scares to force its audience into eeriness. Some of the best scenes in the film, come from the quietness, stillness of the camera, and how it pans from frame to frame to tell, the story. While, the movie is full of scenes of useful exposition dialogues. There are hardly any throwaway scenes. There were a lot of foreshadowing. Some of my favorites are the 'Simon Says' & 'Answers to anything' scene. Every one of the film runtime was well paced until the end. As much, as I love the ambiguous bittersweet ending with the video tape, showing what happen to Gordon and the family; it's does go, a little too long at parts. Also, it's also a bit impractical for the entirely of Gordon's plan, to hinges on, something that, may, or may not happen. Thank goodness, Joel Edgerton didn't use the alternate ending. It would had really ruin the film, because it explain, way too much. For the most part, the ambiguous ending was the right choice. I love how vague, it was. It makes its audience think. I love films like that. Gripping and thought-provoking. One thing, that I really don't understand, is why this movie got a strong 'R' rating. Surprising, this horror film has very little violence and sex. Other psychological thrillers would had exploited the hell of it, but not this film. This film could easily, fall into PG-13 territory. Overall: While, this movie might seem like an Anti-Bullying Commercial; it really isn't. All the characters have their dark sides. Some are more likable, than others. There is no black and white. Just shades of gray. It's pretty much, a realistic character study piece worth checking out. A well-wrapped psychological thriller. A must watch. Simon says.",The Gift

52,Reno-Rangan,"In a rage for revenge, the GIFTS can be our handy weapon.",7,14 December 2015,"Firstly, it was well written by Joel Edgerton as well debuted as a director with it. That is only because of comparing with other over hyped crappy mystery-thrillers. Frankly, to me it was a decent flick that I enjoyed watching. Flaws, loopholes, whatever you call them, this film had so many due to lack of revelation of the earlier occurrence. While I tried to raise the questions on the issues I found, I also discovered possible answers for them. So either way it covers up as a little smartly, but in reality that does not make any sense at all.Kind of a revenge movie, but I can't reveal more than that about the theme as it may spoil if you have not seen it yet. It was about a young married couple who moved back to their hometown after losing their unborn baby. They encounter one of their high school friends in a shopping mall and the relationship grows intensely on one end where the other side was indirectly denied. So what might happen when the grown up guys caught in a state like this is what brings the crux of the story.As usual Rebecca Hall was so hot, Jason Bateman in a convincing act and Joel Edgerton, who was in a key role exhibited his part decently. Pretty good title as well. In the beginning it looked so simple, but while story moving forward the meaning was intensely unveiled.The narration was kind of brilliant, because it won't let you take a side when clash begin to happen. At a time not quite easy to predict the scenes. This mystery-thriller was too much dramaticed and presented at a slow pace. Especially avoids the serious violences, but still covers a few that obviously required to shape up the film. Like I said it was not a special movie, but worth to choose and for a few people it might be an awesome flick.6½/10",The Gift

'The Gift' was his directorial debut, and if it is anything to go by, I'm sure we can expect amazing films from him. The film has some really great scares, with great acting, and great suspense. Joel himself is wonderful as the antagonist. Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall are equally great, but especially Bateman, me thinks. He's just a natural.

54,sol-,Gifts,6,29 September 2016,"Not to be confused with the Sam Raimi/Cate Blanchett clairvoyance film of the same name, this more modern thriller is a psycho-stalker variant with writer-director Joel Edgerton starring as a socially awkward individual who invades the privacy of a former high school classmate and his wife. To begin with, 'The Gift' feels quite routine with a set of dead goldfish bringing to mind 'bunny-boiling' after Edgerton's advances are ungraciously rebuffed, but Edgerton remains eerily friendly throughout, with the question soon becoming whether Edgerton or Jason Bateman (as the former classmate) is the real antagonist in the tale. It is an interesting dynamic and there is a lot to like in the way Edgerton defies generic expectations while shying away from boo-moments scares, and yet the film never quite feels like it maximises its potential. The key issue is that Bateman is smug and arrogant from the get-go; things would have been a whole lot more interesting were he a likable character who we gradually come to hate. The twist-filled denouement, while thought-provoking, also feels too neatly packaged for its own good. Whatever the case, this is a nifty little film for Edgerton to make his directional debut with and Rebecca Hall is solid as Bateman's wife too, riddled with the sort of fear and paranoia that arguably her husband should have when everything is finally revealed and made clear.",The Gift
55,Floated2,Different take on a thriller,7,5 April 2017,"The Gift is a suspense thriller surrounding towards the evolution and life of a newly home renovate couple, moving into California. While the film is not necessarily terrifying or violent, it does provide similar traits employed frequently in a typical shocker, from numerous jump-scares to looming hallway shots and sinister themes. The film appeared less of a horror thriller and more of a psychological thriller, with little to no violence which is what many have thought there would be of.The cast delivers, though the ending of the film is somewhat unsatisfactory when thought upon. As it feels more like it was rushed. Gordo (Joel Edgerton) was eerie in a creepy way but it was wondered how far he really could have went, which was not as bad as one to assume. The Gift is an interesting watch with several decent plot twists as it keeps you guessing.",The Gift
56,eddie_baggins,A fine directional debut from Edgerton with fitting twists and turns,7,25 May 2016,"Taking the next big step in his Hollywood career, Australian born actor/writer and now director Joel Edgerton has shown off his not to be scoffed at talents as an all-round movie making master with this highly efficient and in many ways original low key thriller that remains constantly engaging without ever reaching grand heights.The Gift was made for roughly 5 million dollars and its clear Edgerton had faith in his script, characters and actors to carry the weight of the film where more big budgeted Hollywood thrillers of the same ilk would be interested to splash more cash on high stakes scenes or unwarranted set pieces. It shows a class to Edgerton that has been earnt over a number of years, most tellingly in his short films with brother Nash and the Australian produced the Square that entered local Australian cinema screens back in 2008.In those early entries to Edgerton's work behind camera he showed a filmmaking nuance in slow burning stories and letting dialogue take centre stage and The Gift is no different with Edgerton's script a highlight of the film. There's social commentary and snarky delivery of lines and his other cast mates in the form of Rebecca Hall's loving wife Robyn and Jason Bateman's not as first appears Simon seem to have a great time with such a character focused outing.Delivering his best turn in years as the increasingly suspect Simon, it's great to see Bateman finally away from such terrible films as Identity Thief and the Horrible Bosses's series and the way in which Bateman's character slowly morphs into a different persona is a great reason to watch the Gift. Edgerton too has a whole lot of fun playing Gordo ""the weirdo"" and not only looks the part of a slightly demented stalker-like acquaintance but acts it and while the developing narrative of Gordo's strange behaviours becoming more apparent doesn't in the end feel as strong as it could've been, there's a simple joy for viewers to watch the arc play out.At its best an almost Hitchcockian like thriller that at its worst becomes a little lame, The Gift is a great jumping off point for Edgerton's directional career and while he hasn't always picked the best parts in Hollywood productions (hello Exodus and Jane Got a Gun) he has now shown the industry he has the chops to become a highly successful behind the scenes presence. I for one look forward to what he comes up with next.3 ½ monkey masks out of 5",The Gift
57,leonblackwood,Full of suspense but the ending was disappointing! 5/10,5,27 December 2015,"Review: I'm kind of in two minds about this film because I did get caught up with the whole thriller/suspense aspect of the movie but the outcome wasn't that great. It takes a long time for anything to happen and when it starts to get interesting, the movie ends abruptly, leaving the audience to make up there own ending. The saying ""What goes around comes around"" really is the main concept of this movie and I liked the fact that Simon's true character started to come out towards the end but I was hoping for a massive showdown between Simon and Gordo. Anyway, Simon (Jason Bateman) and Robyn (Rebecca Hall), play a loving couple who move back to Simon's hometown and buy a new house together. Whilst shopping, they bump into Simon's old school friend who starts to turn up at there house when Simon's not in. He then invites the couple to there house for a meal and while Robyn is outside, Simon tells Gordo to stop sending them gifts and coming round when he's not there. After a while, strange things start to happen around the house when Robyn is alone and she starts to get a bit paranoid and she's keeps on thinking that someone is in the house with her. She then finds out that Simon has been investigating Gordo for some time and she takes it upon herself to do her own investigating about what happened in there childhood. After finding out some information from Simon's old school buddy, she realises that she doesn't really know Simon at all and that he was actually a school bully who caused Gordo severe problems during his childhood. Simon also uses his old bully tactics to get further in his job and when his wife and friends find out during a meal at there house, it causes a problem with there marriage, during Robyn's pregnancy. After a while, Gordo finally gets his own back on Simon which destroys his perfect world with his wife and new born baby. On paper, the movie does have many elements which are perfect for a movie in this genre but after such a big build up throughout the film, the ending seemed rushed and not thoroughly thought through. The acting was great from the whole cast and I liked the whole ""perfect couple"" element to this mysterious thriller. There are a couple of glitches with the script, like why didn't Simon just have a DNA test at the hospital or why didn't Gordo just go to the police to report the beating but that's just my humble opinion. Anyway, it's a watchable movie which does keep you on the edge of your seat but it takes some time to get going at the ending wasn't that great. Watchable!Round-Up: This movie was written and directed by Joel Edgerton, 41, who also played Gordo in the film. He recently starred in Black Mass with Johnny Depp and the epic Exodus with Christian Bale so he's played some major roles in some big budget movies. He also stars in the upcoming movie, Life which is about a photographer whose assigned to take pictures of James Dean and with another 3 movies in post production, I'm surprised that he had the time to write and direct this movie. I was shocked to see that he starred in Stars Wars: Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith because I don't really remember him in those movies. Anyway, he was great in Animal Kingdom and he put in some great performances in the Thing remake, Warrior, Zero, Dark Thirty and the Great Gatsby so this Australian born actor must be pleased with his career so far. I just hope that he doesn't become one of those actors who disappear into thin air after a while.Budget: $5million Worldwide Gross: $59millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their drama/mystery/thrillers starring Jason Bateman, Rebecca Hall, Joel Edgerton and Wendell Pierce. 5/10",The Gift
58,pmtelefon,Not good.,4,26 April 2019,"""The Gift"" makes the cardinal sin of movies. It doesn't make sense. A movie doesn't have to make sense in my world (or your world) but it needs to make sense in its own world. ""The Gift"" doesn't. When it's over, anyone who thinks back on what they just watched will realize that the ""The Gift"" is ridiculous.

59,matthewssilverhammer,Ominous Suburban Nightmare,7,14 August 2015,"The trailers for The Gift make it seem like a dull home-invasion yarn as forgettable as last week's soap opera. In actuality, director Edgerton's debut is quieter and more skillfully patient film than expected, with a style and tone more mature than most. With shades of Polanski, the ever-present tension is more of the skin-crawling variety, with only a few earned yet effective jump scares. It's a suspense film firmly staked in real-ness, making it an ever-ominous, steadily increasing suburban nightmare. The situation is uncomfortably relatable: a couple (Bateman and Hall) becomes increasingly annoyed / creeped out by a strange and assertive man (Edgerton) from their past. Each of these three performances is really strong and naturalistic. Hall plays broken perfectly, and Bateman is fantastically authentic as Simon, a wonderfully complex character whose morality and motivations are as fluid as his truth. Edgerton, however, is the standout as the subtly pushy and socially-off neighbor. Every time his character showed up uninvited, I got physically nauseous, as if I had to deal with him myself. The movie wants us to be annoyed by him, all while feeling bad for it, and it fully succeeds. Much like last year's Gone Girl, these first-class discomforts work as a takedown of the American Dream. When our success creates space for boredom or selfish ambition, dangerous fear and anxiety can lead to poor judgment. Along with manipulation and compulsive lying themes, it's not necessarily the happiest movie of the summer. However, The Gift is a slow-moving, non-pandering thriller made for adults that's a nice change of pace in the middle of the blow-em-up summer cinemas.",The Gift
60,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Edgerton's gifts are apparent in simple, smart, genre-flipping thriller",8,4 January 2016,"Just as quickly as he became a formidable actor, Joel Edgerton may well become a formidable filmmaker. ""The Gift,"" his debut feature as a writer/director, has the look of a cliché stalker mystery/thriller, but then flips everything on its head.""The Gifts"" stars Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall as Simon and Robyn, a young couple who move to Los Angeles for a new start. When they run into one of the husband's old high school acquaintances, Gordo (Edgerton), his overly friendly welcome teeters on creepy, but a secret about the past sends everything into a tailspin.For the third of the film, our lens remains fixed on Gordo, the enigma who sounds off all our alarms. The mystery revolves around who he is and what his intentions are, with Robyn feeling sorry for Gordo and Simon feeling threatened, but as Robyn goes after the truth, suddenly it's the past that becomes the mystery.Edgerton totally skewers the audience with both the ""threat"" of conventional thriller tactics that genre fans love and also the greater mystery that reveals itself. With his audience captivated, he drives home a powerful message that lies at the heart of the film.Genre fans who enjoy being totally duped by a thriller with a trademark reveal or payoff might be a little disappointed, but someone not wholly counting on that experience will almost certainly be pleasantly surprised with how Edgerton subverts the genre and uses it as a vehicle to deliver a poignant message that might otherwise feel unoriginal.In the cast, Hall is as dependable as ever as a wife left to feel conflicted between this kind albeit unusual stranger and her forthright, unsympathetic husband. Bateman, usually cast as the everyman, is a really nice fit in ""The Gift"" because of it. We haven't been given the pleasure of doing anything other than rooting for Bateman in every film he's been in and in this case it isn't so simple.Strong original ideas with simple, gripping premises and don't come along nearly as often as they should. For this gift, we must give Edgerton our absolute thanks.",The Gift

But in the end the suspense deflates a bit like a balloon when the plot is explained.,6,30 April 2018,"A couple relocates after a miscarriage to a new town to make a new fresh start. Suddenly they get stalked by an old schoolfriend who just happens to live in the same new neighbourhood. However weird he might act and however obnoxious he might be in coming to see them uninvited over and over again he doesnt break any law perse. He is just somewhat weird and wants contact when the couple didnt ask for any friendship. The couple decide to bluntly tell the guy that they dont ever want to see him again. After that weird things start to happen around the house. That is the creepy part. The reason that creepy things start to happen around their new house is the clever part of the story. But at the end of the movie I felt a little disappointed. The great suspense kinda deflated at the end when I knew why everything happened the way it did. All in all certainly an entertaining creepy movie about stalking and about a lot more which I cant explain right now, because of spoilers. Story could have been better. And the drama could have been intenser. In the end it felt like a somewhat unbelievable story that spoiled the very good suspense of the first half of the movie. But then again this is often the case with movies that depend on the plot, it either is believable or it is somewhat cheesy cheap. This one is in between. 7 stars.",The Gift
63,paul-allaer,"Much better than expected... ""bad things, they can be a gift!""",8,11 September 2015,"""The Gift"" (2015 release; 108 min.) brings the story of a thirty-something married couple Simon and Robyn (played by Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall). As the movie opens, we see them then looking at a beautiful house in Hollywood Hills. They decide to buy it and movie in. The very next day at the store, Simon runs into Gordon, or more accurately Gordon comes up to Simon but Simon doesn't recognize him. Gordon refreshes Simon's memory that they went to high school together. The next day Gordon leaves a welcome gift (bottle of wine) at their door. The day after that, Gordon shows up at the house while Simon is at work. At this point we are maybe 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, this is the Joel Edgerton show all the way: not only does he make a very impressive directing debut here, but he also also wrote the script and stars as Gordon a/k/a/ Gordo the Weirdo. Second, if you are simply expecting a 'scary' movie, yes there is some of that but let's be clear: this is not a 'slash and gore' movie by any means. It is far more like a psychological drama, examining the long legacy of something that may or may not have happened a long time ago, and how that taxes the marriage of Simon and Robyn. During dinner early on in the movie, Gordon comments to Simon that ""bad things, they can be a gift"", and this movie certainly turns them into a gift for us, the viewers. We are a good hour into the movie when the Big Reveal comes, and you had better strap on a seat belt for the wild ride that is the last 45 min. The acting performances are solid throughout, even with Rebecca Hall looking at her most 'mousey-est' as the tormented house wife. Last, UK indie band Temples' excellent single ""Keep In The Dark"" plays over the movie's closing titles.Bottom line: were it not for a recommendation from a friend whose movie judgment I respect, I doubt that I would have gone to see this. So glad I did! The matinée screening where I saw this at recently was attended okay but not great. Then again, this has been in the theaters for well over a month now. Given its minuscule production budget, ""The Gift"" can be considered a modest but most unexpected summer hit. ""The Gift"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",The Gift

If you yourself know what it's like to be bullied, you might get the biggest thrill from the twist and turns being made here.It's a nice horror set up without being a horror movie. it's a thriller that reminds me of the type of things Alfred Hitchcock did.Edgerton plays creeping and awkward really well, almost as well as Jason Bateman's jerk.

65,jtindahouse,Solid debut by Edgerton,7,6 November 2015,"'The Gift' is an interesting movie. It's a lot more patient than most modern day thrillers. It almost needs 'drama' included as one of its genre tags. Joel Edgerton in his first directed film (which he also wrote and starred in), has done quite a good job and separates his film from clichés and predictable traps which is a tough thing for directors to achieve these days seemingly. The only gripe I really have with the movie is the ending. The ending could be seen as the films greatest strength - or its biggest downfall. The 'twist' the movie provides is the reveal that Edgerten's character 'Gordo' may have raped 'Robyn' and thus may be the father of 'Simon' and hers newly-born baby. 'Simon' seems distraught and the movie ends leaving us with the implication that he has been served his justice for what he did to 'Gordo' years earlier. That is unless someone takes a second to actually think about this and how absurd it really is. A simple paternity test is going to show one of two things. Either 'Gordo' is the father, which is going to be devastating to 'Simon' sure, but is also going to result in 'Gordo' going to prison for a very long time. Or alternatively (and as I suspect is the case) they find out 'Simon' is indeed the father and a couple of days worry is his entire punishment for ruining 'Gordo's' entire life.What would have put this film in the record books as a truly great thriller would have been to follow in the footsteps of 'Se7en' or 'Oldboy' and really follow through with the ending. 'Gordo' needed to prove he was indeed the father and either admit he was happy to go to prison in exchange for this, commit suicide or simply disappear without a trace. The movie really relies on people not taking the time to actually explore the ending and how silly it really is. That is why the film ends very quickly at this point. Ending aside though, the rest of the film is very well done and worth a watch regardless. I look forward to seeing what Edgerten moves onto next.",The Gift

68,jadavix,"Tense, and raises questions",8,18 July 2016,"""The Gift"" is an example of the kind of thriller they don't make much any more. They were everywhere in the '90s: movies about odd loners who cross the line in their interaction with regular people and become dangerous. I'm thinking of things like ""The Hand That Rocks the Cradle"", ""Pacific Heights"", ""Unlawful Entry"", ""Single White Female"" and in the 2000s, ""One Hour Photo"".In most of these movies one of the regular people might overreact to innocuous but odd behaviour by the loner and create a problem between them, and then the loner would turn evil.The question that these movies tend to hedge around is who is really in the wrong in these situations. If one person is a little odd, and the other becomes aggressive in response, who is the instigator?""The Gift"" doesn't break the mold, it just does what it does better than all of those, and it lets this question come to the forefront with a portrayal by Jason Bateman as a man whose actions create situations like these. The person going fully crazy is a cop out. It lets us forget the regrettable actions on the other side because we think, well, they were crazy anyway, so it didn't matter what they did.""The Gift"" doesn't really give us that way out; it understands the situation isn't as cut and dried.While very good, it isn't perfect: there is a situation later on with a recorded conversation I saw coming a mile away, but it comes late enough in the movie to not do any damage, I just didn't feel it was necessary.",The Gift

It also makes a good reason for not attending your high school reunion-reconnecting is not always a good thing. Jason and Rebecca are a married couple that have just moved back to Jason's home town. While shopping Joel approaches them, claiming to recognize Jason from high school, which was some 20 years earlier. At first Jason does not place his face but then, he remembers him and does what most people would do in that kind of a situation, exchange numbers and say something like, Let's get together! Wrong thing to do, in this case. Joel is a little awkward in social situations and you can just tell that there is something wrong with that boy. Joel starts becoming a nuisance by popping up unexpectedly and leaving gifts on their doorsteps, with cryptic notes-I'm ready to let bygones be bygones. Allison plays Jason and Rebecca's next door neighbor. Pretty soon you discover what is behind the odd behavior and what happened 20 years earlier and it's not all exactly what you might think it is. You might even start to question just how well you really know someone, especially when you thought you knew them pretty good. Oh yeah, it's written and directed by Joel Edgerton who has acted in quite a few movies but this is his first time directing- he has done a few short films but nothing like this. It's rated ""R"" for language and has a running time of 1 hour & 48 minutes.

70,alindsay-al,A great unique thriller,8,1 April 2016,"I had heard pretty good things about the gift and now I have seen it and I thought it was a great film. The premise of this film sees a couple move to a new house when they are met by an old acquaintance of the husband which starts to cause tension. Jason bateman is a pretty good comedic actor but he absolutely changed for this film giving probably the best performance of his career. He is great in this film because he uses his humour to create a real damaged character who you feel like there is allot of depth to him. Rebecca hall plays his wife and also does a great job playing a strong female character who really tries to figure out what is going on. Joel Edgerton directed, wrote and starred in this film as the character gordo and was great. His character was creepy but there was a bit of likability to him that made you sympathise for him even though he is a bit of a creep. The story is good especially as more and more of the secrets are unravelled. However, there are a couple of side plots that are focused on and I didn't really care for them at all. The script is really good with the drama all feeling real with a mix of real humour that makes these characters feel real. The style of the films is good with the use of tension really making this film interesting and a thrill. However, the pacing of this film is pretty slow and it feels like a longer film then it is. Overall this isn't a film I will watch loads but it is a great film that you should see.",The Gift

72,kluseba,"Twisted mixture of a drama, psycho thriller and horror movie",9,21 September 2015,"''The Gift'' is one of the very best movies in a so far rather disappointing cinematic year 2015. The low-budget production lives from its strong acting and twisted plot that comes around with creative ideas and unpredictable surprises from start to finish. The dialogues, effects and locations are realistic and make this a very authentic, credible and realistic movie. Don't let the rather generic trailer and the seemingly ordinary synopsis fool you.The movie kicks off like a rather usual psycho thriller. A young and successful couple portrayed by gifted actors Rebecca Hall and Jason Bateman just moved back to California and organizes its new life. The fragile Robyn and the self-confident Simon have just purchased a gorgeous new home, Simon has found a promising job where he might get promoted soon and Robyn starts working on a few new things at home. One afternoon, the couple meets the socially awkward Gordo, played by the unpredictable Joel Edgerton who really steals the show, who is an old classmate of Simon. He seems to be very kind to the couple but Simon refuses to develop a friendly relationship to him. Gordo though gently insists and starts offering expensive gifts to the couple. Robyn has a heart for the charming outsider and convinces her husband to invite him for dinner but things don't stop there. Soon, Gordo starts taking a lot of space in their lives, stalks the insecure Robyn and offers more and more expensive gifts to her and Simon. At this point, the audience starts to realize how fragile the relationship between Robyn and Simon really is. They are constantly debating and rarely agreeing with each other. Simon feels forced to take a radical decision and tells Gordo to leave them alone for good.That's where the movie starts to become a gripping horror movie. Gordo seemingly continues to stalk the couple and weird things start happening to them. Their fishes die, their dog disappears and Robyn feels constantly observed when she is home alone. At one moment, she even seems to have a nervous breakdown and starts taking strong medication. The relationship between Robyn and Simon decreases as she seems to be too weak to turn the page and Simon too egocentric to really care about his wife's concerns.At that moment, the movie takes another turn. The couple's dog comes back and is alive and kicking. Robyn realizes that she is pregnant and Simon soon gets promoted. Everything seems too perfect to be true and as a matter of fact, the movie soon turns into a twisted drama as the past comes back to haunt both Robyn and Simon. The audience soon discovers more and more about the mysterious past of Gordo, Robyn and Simon and after a while the thin line between potential culprits and victims seems to disappear.Even though my short summary might seem detailed to you, it only gives away some minor details about one of the best plots in the psycho thriller genre of the past five years. The movie doesn't stop to come around with new surprises and a more and more convincing acting. Each time the movie seems to take a break, the menacing atmosphere comes back with a sudden bang and plays with the anticipation, emotions and perceptions of the audience. You can't let go off the film and even the unusual and controversial ending will stay on your mind for a quite long time. If you like this highly recommendable movie of the year candidate, make sure to check out the clever French film noir gem ''The Serpent'' by Eric Barbier that is quite similar to this film but different enough to be worth to be discovered.",The Gift

She's a designer and they have trouble getting pregnant.At some home store he, Simon, runs into a high school classmate named Gordon, called Gordo. It takes a while for Simon to recognize Gordo. At the store Gordo learns their address. The next day he leaves a bottle of wine at the door step. He stops by often and the woman, Robyn, is particularly friendly towards him, even though he's a bit overbearing. He tends to stop by during the day when Simon is at work, always bringing gifts. Things don't seem quite right and the couple discuss it with their friends. One night he invites them over to his place, a mansion, but quickly leaves to resolve some work issue. They check out the place, find a closet full of women's clothing, even though he claims to be single, plus a kid's room. Simon takes advantage of the situation to mock Gordo and tells Robyn that he thinks Gordo's intention is to ""nail"" her. When Gordo returns, Simon decides to confront him about his visits and basically puts and end to the relationship.Meanwhile Simon is vying for a promotion at work and is competing with one other guy for it. Now the fish Gordo gave them appear dead, their dog goes missing. Gordo sends a letter apologizing and speaks of bygones being bygones, something that has Robyn confused. She asks Simon about it but he pretends there's nothing to it. But Robyn continues to feel sorry about Gordo and asks Simon's sister about him who reveals something quite terrible in Gordo's past that Simon and another friend were involved in. Robyn tracks down the friend and learns the truth of the situation and about her husband. She demands he apologizes to Gordo so he finds him performing at some magic club, apologizes but Gordo isn't very receptive, so Simon beats him up and lies to Robyn about it.At this point Robyn is pregnant, earlier in the movie she had a strange fainting episode. Simon gets the job. Robyn learns that Simon obtained a full background check of Gordo and his competitor for the job. There are some more strange episodes, the coupe sort of breaks up right after Robyn gives birth and Gordo shows that he has a couple of cards up his sleeve.The Gift is a great tense thriller that doesn't settle for some easy arc or outcome. All the time you're expecting Gordo to flip out and cause mayhem, but it never happens quite the way you would expect it. But all along the character that comes forward as also problematic is the husband. And Bateman can be credited with a surprisingly good performance. He completely nails the rich guy who is doing so well in life that he doesn't have to bother about being nice or even decent to people anymore, unless of course money and his ego are involved, then he can be the nicest guy in the world. He also appears to be a great husband, but that's exactly how those people are. Just wonderful at home, even there always slightly manipulative, but jerks outside of their small intimate circle because everyone outside is perceived as a competitor. Poor Rebecca Hall, here without hair, who is the only British actor who doesn't get to use her accent at a time when Hollywood is pathologically obsessed with British actors, looks awful and downright ill but is always likable even when her character does some puzzling things. Gordo, played by the director/writer/producer has just the right amount of weird to keep us suspicious of him all throughout the movie. We learn some more of his background which doesn't help in exonerating him.This movie also captures these non-civilized pockets right in the center of the highest levels of civilization. While the aim of civilization is to transcend the ""laws"" of the animal kingdom and of nature, more and more we are seeing that enterprise failing miserably, as with power and wealth also come brutishness and a return to the law of jungle--might makes right. The strong destroying the weak for no reason other than to exert force is becoming troublingly common and accepted.In some regards this movie reminded me of the even more radical and perhaps distasteful Inside and Deadgirl. Not sure what the director's inspirations were, but this movie is also filmed in a very un-American way, at a moderate pace with scenes lasting longer than the would otherwise and longer than they should. There are few extremes of emotion, but rather a measured moderation all along, which makes the ugliness even more poignant. And in the end, you get a situation like in Martyrs where the audience doesn't get a definite answer. The Gift is another great movie in what has been a strong year for unique horror thrillers and one of my favorites along with The Guest, It Follows, and Spring. It is a remarkable achievement for first-time director Edgerton.",The Gift
76,aharmas,Telling Stories,10,16 August 2015,"""The Gift"" is one of those marvelous films that grabs you from the beginning, gives you enough in the trailer to hook you up and never disappoints you because layer after layer comes off, until the twisted ending. Joel Edgerton pulls a triple play: directing, writing, and acting the main role in this entertaining and thrilling film that would have made Hitchcock green with envy.Two friends run into each other at a store. Gordon (Edgerton) seems genuinely interested in catching up with Simon (Bateman). There's something odd about Gordon, appearing a little awkward and afraid. There is a hint that Gordon and Simon share unpleasant memories, and in the middle Robyn (Hall) begins to wonder what lies in the past.Gordon finds his way into their home, offering tokens of friendship, seeking their acceptance. This is when the film begins to play with our perceptions because Gordon seems innocent and victim-like at times, and he's a bit obsessive in some ways. Robyn and Gordon connect. Simon is uncomfortable and wants him to go away.Gordon invites them to a dinner, where the couple discovers there might be a few mysteries in Gordon's life. It's at this crucial moment that Simon decides to cut his ties with Gordon, leading Gordon to react in a very peculiar manner. As their relationship begins to unravel, things become stranger and more violent, though they never reach slasher level, and this keeps us hanging because we know the truth will be of shattering proportions.Eventually we learn why Gordon and Simon are at odds. There is also some nasty business in the perfect household, as Robyn drops hints that it's not easy living with Simon. When she becomes pregnant, it appears everything has improved, but we soon realize that neither Gordon or David are done with their business.By the time we discover what the gift is, we have learned that everyone involved has a few skeletons in his/her past. It is hard to say who is guiltier and who deserves their fate. Like ""Fatal Attraction"" and the darker ""Se7en"", we find ourselves debating who is responsible for what and whether their actions are justified. Someone does walk away a winner, though, and whether you agree with the ending, it's will not be easy to reach that decision.",The Gift

Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall are good too as the couple who move into a new house in California only to find an old friend hanging around more than they would like. I enjoyed this because it has you guessing the characters motives throughout and it had a real edge of the seat feel about it .",The Gift
78,jadepietro,All the Trimmings,8,16 August 2015,"(Rating: ☆☆☆ out of 4) This film is recommended. In brief: A neatly packaged psychological thriller.GRADE: B Before we review our feature presentations, let's take a moment to discuss the sorry state of today's movie trailers. The simple job of the film preview is to entice the moviegoer into returning, with cash in hand, to see the finished product by showing short snippets of the future movie. But nowadays, these coming attractions seem to come in two varieties, leaving nothing to one's imagination. They do a disservice to their commodity, either giving away too much plot, as in Southpaw, Max, Ricky and the Flash, or Woman in Gold or totally misleading the audience into thinking it is seeing another genre with its slight-of-hand like Mr. Holmes and our main event today, The Gift, which comes off as a possibly violent psycho-slasher thriller when the opposite is true. ￼ Instead, The Gift is a nifty little mystery that keeps one guessing throughout the movie's twists and turns and even holds up after viewing. It doesn't tie up all the loose ends in one neat little package (pardon the pun), but it makes logical sense when discussing the time frame and circumstances with your movie-going friends after-wards. It is a rarity these days to enjoy an well thought-out adult suspense drama since so many filmmakers tend to go for shock value and violence to cover-up the flaws in their storytelling. The Gift is that atypical movie that respects its own genre and doesn't go that easy route and one needs to admire such a film.The film starts off rather slowly as we met Robyn (Rebecca Hall) and Simon (Jason Bateman), a well-to-do couple recently moved to Los Angeles. This used to be Simon's hometown and it is here that he once again bumps into a high school acquaintance named Gordo (Joel Edgerton). Both share a deep dark secret from the past as they renew their strained relationship, which instills some concern from his curious wife, especially when Gordo the Weirdo (his high school nickname) bestows on them several gifts as his personal thank yous. His behavior gives off a mixed message: Is he out for revenge and stalking this couple or just a lonely social misfit looking for friendship?￼The Gift is a taut psychological thriller that engages the moviegoer and expects its audience to have a modicum of intelligence in following the clues. Sometimes it does overstate the obvious and goes for cheap scare tactics with startling sound effects or an inane dream sequence to cause some screams along the way. But, on a whole, it respects its Hitchcock tradition as a solid mystery should.Mr. Edgerton did triple duty on this film. It is his feature debut as a writer / director and he co-stars in his project. Glad to report, his talent succeeds in all of these areas. His script is slightly convoluted but efficiently written and his characters are well drawn. His direction is concise and focused and he allows suspense to build through the character's actions. His acting shows Gordo's vulnerability, sadness, and anger ever so subtly. He also wisely chose to fill his other characters with Ms, Hall and Mr. Bateman playing opposite him. Ms. Hall pulls you into her character's dilemma from the onset as she begins to confront the lies and cover- ups. The actress is excellent in her changing moods. But it is Jason Bateman who impresses with his acting range, taking his good guy persona and adding some rough edges to his character as he plays this game of intrigue. It is a fully accomplished portrait of a man trying to control his present life but unable to do so because of past transgressions.￼The Gift delivers the goods with all the trimmings. Even if some omissions in the plot are never fully explained, the film remains a tense and rewarding mystery thriller.

79,Amyth47,1 star for a terrible ending!!,1,7 February 2019,"My Rating: 1/10I, along with many other viewers, found the ending really stupid and it pretty much completely undoes the entire first half, which is brilliant I might add, and reduces the film to a mere cheap cop-out soap story.Really disappointed and feel let down by all the people listing it as a top thriller in their recommendations.",The Gift
80,Seraphion,A good ride yet it gets predictable very early on,6,7 November 2015,"The story shows quite a good writing by Joel Edgerton. It can really be good ride as the movie develops more and more. The thing is that this movie tends to be very predictable from the start. This is due to the audience now has already seen so many drama thrillers like this that they already thought of how odd Gordo was when he dresses like that yet manages to have a big house. From then all other twists and turns feel rather bland because the audience has already built their anticipation and think of possibilities to which the story will like lead. The drama aspect is evenly felt, showing that Joel Edgerton can adequately handle simple directing also. The acting feels nice in overall. Jason Bateman is seemed easy to portray Simon due to he's well versed in the spread of drama and comedy alike. Rebecca Hall is no stranger to thrillers so her good performance here is as expected. Joel Edgerton did great, especially in handling three jobs at once for this movie.",The Gift
81,Galina_movie_fan,"""See, you're done with the past, but the past is not done with you.""",8,8 January 2016,"Time will tell whether Joel Edgerton joins the exclusive club of the famous actors turned talented and successful film directors or sticks to the acting career but his directorial debut, ""The Gift"", was a nice gift to the fans of the psychological thrillers in the Alfred Hitchcock's fashion or, rather, their new variety, ""marriage thrillers"" that follow the success of David Fincher's provocative Gone Girl. Edgerton, who gave a bravura performance in the fellow Aussie's, Buz Luhrmann's adaptation of Great Gatsby, hit the trifecta with writing the screenplay, directing, and producing The Gift, and also playing one of the three main characters. Edgerton undoubtedly loves the good thriller and proves to know how to make one. The Gift starts with a married couple, Simon (Jason Bateman) and Robyn Callen (Rebecca Hall), relocated from Chicago to a suburban Los Angeles neighborhood after Simon finds a new job outside the city that should propel him to the corporate heights. While out buying supplies for their new picture-perfect home, they run into Gordon ""Gordo"" Moseley (Joel Edgerton), a former high school classmate of Simon's who Simon claims to have completely forgotten about. Soon after, Gordo begins dropping in unannounced, usually when Simon is at work. He sends thoughtful housewarming gifts for the couple, neatly wrapped in the bright paper, with the bow attached, accompanied with nice handwritten card in the red envelope. Without giving too much away, it should be said that whatever started as yet another retelling of the ""Fatal Attraction"" type story, turned out as the dissections of such ugly but persisting realities of life as bullying, human cruelty, unconscious desire for dominating that would start in someone's past and would cover all aspects and spheres of human communicating, including school, family, the workplace, and neighborhood. Main idea of Edgerton's film as shared by director himself during an interview is acknowledgment of one's past, admitting to the wrong doings in order to be able to build the future. But it brings a question: do we change as time goes by? Are we able to admit the guilt that went unpunished and to face the consequences? Can we predict to what extend will our words and deeds affect someone's life? Someone whom we won't even recognize if run across accidentally after many years? Edgerton plays with the viewers' expectations and takes them to the unpredictable directions adding to the plot more layers and depths. The way he tells the story while building up the suspense and creating disturbing atmosphere is remarkable. He almost convinces the viewers that they could guess easily what would happen next yet when they expect it the least, he pulls the rug from under their feet. As a director, his use of the multiple glass surfaces is masterful. The heavily windowed houses in the nice South California area, Hollywood Hills, are as important to the plot as three main characters. Huge windows and glass doors seem to bring people closer but, at the same time, they stand as the walls of alienation and estrangement. Massive glass elements soon become gloomy threatening messengers of impending psychological horror which comes from the sins of the past that have not been acknowledged. Danger may lurk behind the misted glass door while you take a shower in the safety of your house. There is a silhouette disappearing in the air in the manner of Keyser Söze behind the thick matt glass doors in the hospital. The movie keeps surprising us by changing the viewpoints, by showing that what we see is not always what actually goes on in front of us. It makes us ask themselves, do we really know these closest to us, someone whom we think we share the intimate knowledge of ultimate closeness with. One of the delicious surprises the movie provides is the characters development that drives the story and moves it in the different directions. Both, Rebecca Hall and Jason Bateman play real people, complex and alive, not just two-dimensional carton figures. Jason Bateman, especially, impresses by bringing out dark sides of Simon's confident, successful, charismatic persona. But the best gift Edgerton keeps to the very end. For the movie which important and repeated over and over image are nice wrapped gift boxes of the different sizes and shapes, the writer/director refuses to wrap up the ending and attach the colorful bow to it. The Gift's conclusion is open but strangely satisfying. What goes around comes around, and bygones don't want to be bygones.",The Gift
82,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of The Gift,7,8 August 2015,"Jason Bateman's latest is 2015's The Gift. In truth, it's like nothing you've ever seen him in before. He's volcanic and wouldn't you know it, this marks his best performance to date. Now granted, ""Gift"" sure ain't no comedy (Jaybird's normal shtick over the last thirty years). It's psychological warfare, a bender of a movie that puts your fragile mind through the ringer. No one (including any audience member) is safe, there's no true protagonist, and despite a ho-hum ending (which won't compel you but make you feel a little sick to your stomach), I would still call it one of the best things to come out this year. For everyone who wants to escape the summer movie standard, just picture this: Two grim, torn up main characters go at it (mano a mano) while a pushover pregnant lady stands as an innocent pawn. Intrigued by my play on words? I sure as heck hope so.Misled by its trailer (this is not a thriller or a horror exercise but a hard-edged drama), using tons of gifts as props (naturally), and presenting its conflicted narrative right from the get-go, The Gift chronicles one Simon (Jason Bateman). After getting a job promotion as a budding salesman, he moves from Chicago with his Chicago-bred wife (Robyn played by Rebecca Hall), to Southern California where he grew up. He buys a new house (containing lots of glass and mirrors which only add to the visual palate of the director's vision), gets settled in, and has hopes of starting a family despite said wife garnering a previous miscarriage.In terms of his personality, Simon is a heavy drinker and relatively smarmy (I feel his character may have a little regret bottled up inside). His better half is a former pill popper and overly nice. As they are buying products to spruce up their new abode, a man from Simon's past comes around and talks both of them up (Gordon played by Joel Edgerton). You see, Simon and ""Gordo"" went to high school (together) over twenty years ago with something fishy going down between them (in a car). I won't give away anything more only to tell you that Gordon continues to make his presence known and the spousal simpletons start to feel a tad uncomfortable. As a moviegoer, you always sense that something troublesome is coming around the corner and that's the rub deeming ""Gift's"" opening hour highly effective. Essentially, you have a vehicle here that is a revenge vignette (my take is that Gordon wanted to secretly remind Simon that he might have molested ""Gordo the Weirdo"" a long time ago) and something that exposes the lead role for what he really is (Bateman's Simon was a bully back then and he's still a bully today). In one scene, Gordon proclaims, ""you may be done with the past but the past ain't done with you."" No kidding.Now I read a review where a critic talked about The Gift coming out of a time capsule circa 1992. Wow, that's dead-on. Consenting Adults, Unlawful Entry, and The Hand That Rocks the Cradle (all released in 92') literally gave me the same vibe. But hey, ""Gift"" still manages to stand on its own. It's out of the box, it's fornicating, and it burns slowly. It may riff off the aforementioned flicks but that riff is a tribute, a hightail sonnet bent on relishing the concept of taking in a person who's not all there mentally, and letting him/her turn lives upside down. Don't say you weren't warned.""Gift"" is directed by newcomer Joel Edgerton (he mostly acts and has done just two shorts). It's not necessarily scary or horrifying, just eerie. It's also mildly violent yet not bloodcurdling. He shoots the proceedings as if he's channeling some Adrian Lyne stint from the late 80's or early 90's. There's tension throughout but he creates it when it's not really there. Very impressive. In retrospect, you have a solemn tale set in suburban Los Angeles, a smoke and mirrors look that spells dread, and even a homage to 1980's The Shining (room 237, hint hint). Oh and for once, the film score is not filler. It sounds like what great film scores used to project back in the day. For just under two hours, I sat transfixed, salivating for an ending that I knew wouldn't be that great. But let's face it, the journey with The Gift is the high point. Fingernails will be chewed off, your posture will suffice, and bathroom breaks will surely have to wait. All in all, I figured you'd expect me to use a metaphor with the title given. Well, here it goes: The Gift as a movie, has a nice bow, a beautiful grade of wrapping paper, and if you shake it, something inside feels like a dream present. You open the present, thank everyone who gave it to you, but feel a tad dissatisfied. No worries, it's still virtually unreturnable. The result: 3 stars.",The Gift
83,pc95,A Solid Thriller,7,28 November 2015,"(spoilers) Directed and written competently by Aussie actor Joel Edgerton, ""The Gift"" is an extreme psychological thriller that smartly doesn't bow to violence or blood. It is one of the better movies of 2015. Jason Bateman is cast oddly in a role away from his usual comedy and does a good job as the lead character. There's a strange mystery to unravel, and Edgerton with his film making team are up to the task. Edgy music and strange camera views bolster the foreboding story. While not wholly original in its premises, it's execution is stellar. Rebecca Hall leads the acting, Edgerton plays an odd-ball sufficiently. Edgerton has written a few other films, but this looks to be his directorial debut, and he did very well. 7/10 Recommended",The Gift
84,vengeance20,"Dark & Unnerving, though unfinished at the end...",6,9 August 2015,"Just seen this film tonight & have to say it was a pretty dark & unnerving film all round.The film a married couple (Simon & Robyn) who move into a house in a suburban area. But an old friend from over 20 years ago, ""Gordo"" bumps into Simon & his wife. Though Simon at first doesn't remember him. He then starts to leave gifts. Though as the film unravels Simon isn't who he seems & his dark secrets from the past come back to haunt him & his wife begins to find out a side to her her husband she never knew. ""Gordo"" starts to psychologically mess with them throughout along with other parts of Simon's life beginning to peel away reveal his nasty bullying & arrogant side.I thought the film was pretty good! Had some great jump scares here & there & overall had an unnerving feel to it. The parts where you felt on edge were done well also!The story was pretty good & sent out 2 messages one of which the film was saying people aren't who they seem & the other being not to underestimate people. The film had that sense that we all have side's & skeleton in our closets which people don't know about & that when your younger the things you do can come back to kick you in the arse like Karma in other words. But their parts which I thought were abit all to coincidental & picky over. Like the beginning of the film when Simon met Gordo for the first time ""Gordo"" just 'happened' to meet the couple just at the exact moment the retailer announced their address. And why ""Gordo"" chose to start ruining Simon's life just over 20 years ago, when in the film he's smart & was able to track them down, why didn't he do it sooner? The ending left me abit cold, although Simon partly got what he deserved for a grown man to wait over 20 years & do bad things like he was still a young teenager/kid was abit hypercritical & you didn't feel sorry for ""Gordo"" who was pretty much as bad if not worse than Simon himself who bullied him all those years ago. Along with his wife being abit of a knob towards him like she was prefect. We all have dark sides & it was years ago so what? But anyway the ending was abit sh!t & unfinished. It was one of those films which had a unsatisfying ending. A ""touch & go"" kind of ending.Overall, a dark & unnerving film. But has an unfinished ending to it which would disappoint those who want things to be resolved, like me.6/10",The Gift

Through music, plot and other means, the whole film creates a kind of frightening atmosphere, but what we really want to talk about is a truth of life.

His motives are not clear, initially, but it slowly becomes obvious (to the audience) he is playing the wifey against Simon, to ruin his life and career in retaliation for some long ago action.Many plot twists kept it from being predictable, yet also made it a bit too confusing; it leaves too many loose ends, sinking to the level of putting it to the viewer to fill in the blanks, and a few plot holes, which doesn't work well here. Too much of the plot is explained second hand, and hearsay (especially from two decades ago) is not convincing. Without revealing anything of import, the story also gives us no one to root for, before its inconclusive ending, which relied too much on coincidental timing.",The Gift
87,moviewizguy,The movie you didn't know you had to see this summer,8,31 July 2015,"Here's a surprise: The Gift is a mature thriller that's more complex and classy than the trailers suggest. I don't know what caused the marketing department to make the film look like such a second-rate, cheap, predictable thriller that somehow had gotten ahold of talented actors, but now we know the truth. As Joel Edgerton's directorial debut, it's impressive, considering the sense of craft going on behind the camera. The cinematography is gorgeous and the pacing is that of a slow burn, but it's never dull. The premise is also deceptively simple, turning more intricate and involving as the film progresses.Edgerton, who also wrote the screenplay, refuses to adhere to genre conventions, constantly subverting audience's expectations on how the story plays out. Red herrings, plot twists, shifting perspectives, and moral ambiguity ensue, but they never feel cheap. Like the best thrillers, The Gift evolves naturally and realistically. Edgerton and Rebecca Hall are great, but it is Jason Bateman who impresses. As a natural comedian actor, he plays one of his rare, serious roles to terrific effect. But I digress. You should go into this film with a clean slate, but know that it is a rare, intelligent thriller that doesn't cheat or spoonfeed its audience. And in that regard, Joel Edgerton has given us a gift, indeed.",The Gift
88,moviexclusive,"Gripping and thought-provoking in equal measure, 'The Gift' is a well-crafted psychological thriller that also marks a fine filmmaking debut for Joel Edgerton",7,2 August 2015,"'The Gift' is ostensibly about an upper middle-class married couple – Simon (Jason Bateman) and Robyn (Rebecca Hall) – who are terrorised by a ex-classmate of Simon's named Gordo (Joel Edgerton) looking to settle an old score after their move from Chicago back to the former's Los Angeles' East Side neighbourhood. And yet, Edgerton, who also wrote the screenplay, is not just content for his psychological thriller to be just another B-grade exercise; instead, there are more than a few nasty surprises in store for an audience jaded by such run-of-the-mill genre fare, and it is Edgerton's emphasis on character rather than empty shlock that ultimately pays off in a slow-burn but nevertheless consistently gripping mystery.As is typical with such narratives, Simon and Robyn start off as the picture of marital bliss who are looking to move on from an episode in the recent past. Simon is starting a new job at a high-profile digital security firm, and Robyn hopes to get back to her passion as a freelance designer – but the cracks are there, especially the relics of a miscarriage. Following a seemingly serendipitous run-at a downtown furniture store, Gordo leaves a housewarming gift at their doorstep, a generosity that Robyn feels obligated to repay by inviting him over for dinner. Thing is, the gifts keep coming, and while Robyn responds by letting him in out of politeness, Simon is slightly more wary of their overly hospitable guest. His displeasure comes to a head after Gordo makes a hasty and prolonged exit no sooner after they arrive at a surprisingly posh two-storey house upon the latter's dinner invitation.Upon a stern warning to leave them alone, strange things start happening around the house. Robyn gets the nagging sense that Gordo is watching her in the day when she is alone at home, and even starts hallucinating that he is peeping at her in the shower. The disappearance of their family dog one day further cements Simon's suspicion that Gordo hasn't taken too kindly to his admonition. And yet throughout the ensuing unease, Gordo never does appear in person – except in Robyn's daydreams – leaving us wondering if it is all a red herring. Then a letter in Gordo's signature red envelope lands in their mailbox, with a cryptic send-off to Simon to ""let bygones be bygones"". Simon downplays its significance, but Robyn is convinced that Simon is hiding something.Whereas the first act was about Gordo playing the typical psycho stalker, Edgerton reserves the second act for unravelling just who Simon is – and as you may expect, the answers are less than savoury. Peeling back the affable charm on Simon's surface, we are led to discover someone else altogether, so much so that we are forced to re-examine our sympathies for the man in the first place, and by extension, our contempt for Gordo's apparent sociopathic behaviour. Edgerton tells the story from Robyn's perspective, not only because she is as much in the dark about the man she married as us, but also for the fact that, as Simon's façade falls apart, she alone becomes the emotional core of the story and the only one we end up rooting for.Although Robyn's neighbour and Simon's colleagues do pop up for a couple of scenes here and there, this is pretty much a story that stands on just three characters, and Edgerton brings Gordo back in the last act to extract payback from the person whose arrogance and apathy many years ago had set his life on an irreversible downward spiral. There is a sharp lesson here on lies, misdirections and their consequences, and instead of settling for a comfortable ending, Edgerton opts for something much more unnerving that keeps you guessing just what Gordo's motive is all this while. At no point does he settle for conventional thrills, so those expecting a mano- a-mano between Simon and Gordo are bound to be disappointed.Yet those looking for a fine actors' showcase will be pleasantly surprised, for Edgerton gives plenty of room for each one of his actors to shine – including, we may add, himself. Bateman subverts his Everyman likability as he transforms from a nice guy to a sinister bully that has no qualms ruining other people's lives, and the actor better known for his comedic roles turns in a fine dramatic performance with heft and gravitas. Hall is his perfect complement, playing the part of the kind and vulnerable wife with watchful intelligence and quiet empathy. Edgerton is in great form himself as the creepy loner sociopath, who earns our disgust and pity in equal measure as we discover how much of a sad sack he is and what led him there in the first place.To use its very own metaphor, 'The Gift' is like a present within a present whose pleasure lies not just in finding out what it truly is but also in the process of unveiling it layer after layer. That may come off as a drag for less patient audiences or those looking for late-night cable movie thrills, but those willing to accept a slow- burn psychological thriller that unfolds at its own measured pace will find much to like about this well-crafted and well-acted package. It is as assured and auspicious a debut for a first-time filmmaker as any, and Edgerton proves to be both smart and savvy as actor-writer- director in getting the best out of his actors as much as getting under his audience's skin.",The Gift

In fact, I was not disappointed and I spent an interesting and suspenseful evening with my wife. The story carried me and my wife in a very curious or let's say mysterious trip. I mean you never saw the coming plots and sometimes there were some scary scenes. All the actors played their roles respectably and the direction well done. At the end the movie turns really unexpected with no happy end but I don't want to spoil more here. I give a 7 and my wife a 6 that gives 6.5/10.

90,quincytheodore,A creepier way to reconnect than Facebook stalking,8,17 November 2015,"Things may get awkward when meeting people from one's past, especially if they are overly friendly or socially clumsy. The Gift presents this potentially familiar condition and enhanced it with stalker thriller that's also grounded in realism, bringing a deeper psychological aspect into a commentary of the characters aside from just utilizing typical ""odd man chasing nice protagonist"" formula.Simon (Jason Bateman) and Robyn (Rebecca Hall) are a couple who recently relocated back into the husband's home city. Everything seems like your ordinary suburban dream, perfect to start a new family, that is until they are reunited with Simon's old friend Gordo (Joel Edgerton). It soon escalates from simple awkward exchanges into legitimate threats as meeting this odd fellow opens up old buried secrets.The Gift keeps its entire plot balanced, the pace never feels too tiresome or rushed, which is quite an impressive execution in both drama and mystery. It sometimes ventures into horror territory with intriguing camera works, the type which plays with audience whether something is lurking nearby. Furthermore, it sets up the sequences and might just surprise with a couple of timely scares, yet these never feel cheap or forced, it merely empathizes the characters' state of mind or the urgency they may feel.This movie revolves around drama more than horror or mystery. Jason Bateman works wonder as he displays calm personality from outside which may harbor secret or impulsive reaction as the movie progresses. It's a departure from his usual romance or comedy gig, and a definite success at that. Joel Edgerton as Gordo is plain bizarre, although it's not seldom that he enigmatically captivates with the shy act that viewer might just sympathize with him. I nearly didn't recognize this Ramses from Exodus.The Gift never becomes too outlandish or gritty, it delivers its story with incredible calmness even though the subject is confidentially harrowing. Along with sophisticated execution and brilliant acting performance, this is one of the best thrillers of the year.",The Gift
91,Sergeant_Tibbs,Engaging and understated psychological thriller.,7,20 November 2015,"Joel Edgerton seemed to have come out of nowhere when he made my brother cry with Warrior. He's having a better decade than most, even if the film's themselves aren't up to scratch, though he has been around for nearly 20 years including a forgettable role in the forgettable Star Wars prequels. In his first chance at the helm both writing and directing a film, The Gift is a promising statement for a focused creator while The Rover left a couple hints that this would be the case. Naturally, Edgerton himself is the best part of The Gift, with his role as the maligned Gordo haunting the film with his unassuming yet disarming presence. Throughout the film we feel like a voyeur peering into Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall's lives through his eyes. As a domestic horror, or rather, a psychological thriller, Edgerton makes wise choices in giving The Gift a very understated approach. It's much more straightforward than I expected, while the music occasionally indulges in boiling our senses, it's otherwise held back and effective in its detail and slow unveiling of backstory. While it suffers to overcome solutions it doesn't consider, it instead chooses a much smaller scale to inflict its damage. It does a good job of showing a past coming back to bite the present as well as the influence of a rumour, or in its vengeance's case, persuasion. Bateman delivers one of the best dramatic performances he's given yet but Hall steals the moments in her nuanced unease. This is solid engaging work that leaves its paranoia stinging but a couple questions unanswered.7/10",The Gift
92,tomsview,Perfectly wrapped,9,3 January 2016,"Simply a brilliant little mystery. ""Gone Girl"" got all the raves, but for things you don't see coming, ""The Gift"" gives it more than a run for its money.Aussie actor, writer, director Joel Edgerton reveals a Fincher-like talent for dark thrillers.Without giving too much away, the story is about a couple, Simon and Robyn Callum played by Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall, who move back to his hometown. An old, not particularly well-liked acquaintance from school, 'Gordo' Mosley (Joel Edgerton), re-enters his life. As the story unfolds, layers are stripped away, and the past comes back in an unexpected way. The story has more twists than a David Lynch film without all the suspension of logic.Edgerton also reveals a sure touch in casting his movie, Jason Bateman delivers a complex performance as Simon while Rebecca Hall lifts every movie she is in. This is a brilliant script; especially the way the story evolves almost entirely through what the characters say.We don't often see films that play with our first impressions and perceptions like this one.The film is beautifully paced, and has a subtlety disturbing score by Danny Bensi and Saunder Juriaans. Before this they had brought their unsettling themes to Denis Villeneuve's ""Enemy"".One suspects there will be more from Edgerton on the other side of the camera.

93,Screen_Blitz,Brilliantly twisted thriller by the amazing directorial efforts of Joel Edgerton',8,16 March 2016,"Joel Edgerton has made a name for themselves in roles such as in 'Warrior', 'The Great Gatsby', and recent biopic 'Black Mass', but many may not expected him to take the director's chair as well as the screenwriter behind the picture. He manages to surprise us however, in this twisted and shockingly complex psychological thriller that defies viewers' expectations. To brighten the matters, his efforts pay off greatly. This film tells a story of Simon (played by Jason Bateman) and his wife Robyn (played by Rebecca Hall) who move back to their hometown to start a new life with their new business. Along the way, they run into Gordo (played by Joel Edgerton), Simon's old classmate from high school twenty years ago. Gordo greets Simon and Robyn with pure kindness and shows on friendly that dropping by their house with numerous wrapped gifts. But after a series of uninvited visits paid, the couple is drawn until a horrifying secret that leads their past to haunt him and spin their lives out of control. What comes from the amazing efforts of Joel Edgerton's directorial and writing debut is a twisted suspense thriller that greatly challenges viewers' expectations from scene to scene. The story takes the the stalker concept and turns it upside, Edgerton achieves this by giving the protagonist a darker side to make him more of the bad guy and making the stalker look more innocent, and the way he does in this film works surprisingly effective. The film strays away from the typical stalker clichés and generates wildly intelligent thrills that are nearly impossible to predict, unless you are profoundly smart. And this feet could have been achieved without its powerful characters. The characters are written diligently and developed with great complexity. And to complete the rest of the equation are the performances. Jason Bateman soars in what is probably his most mature role he's landed in his career. Joel Edgerton on the other hand, takes the cake with his performance. He serve as the heart of the nerve-racking suspense conveying the story, just enough to leave viewers lean at the edge of their seats. The Gift is a very original, twisted, and profounding thriller with a brilliant script and fantastic directorial flair from Joel Edgerton. His actor leaves a powerful impression for a first time director, and the result is a film that strives with pure suspense and intelligent writing.",The Gift

95,PimpinAinttEasy,Some of the most boring yuppie characters ever .....,4,1 January 2016,"Dear Joel Edgerton the writer,so you tired to rip off Old boy or at least that film's ethos. I think I know what you tried to do here. Except, you tried to make it really plain and boring. The Gift is basically a less intriguing version of Old Boy with terribly boring characters and bad acting. Man, the two main characters in this movie where two of the most boring and vacuous of all time. Could you not have set this movie in any other milieu? Why did they have to be yuppies? Were you inspired by those two books by Julian Barnes where men solve their complex relationships and rivalries by taking it all out on the other's woman?As for Joel Edgerton the director, I have nothing to say to the guy. This is one of the most non-directorial films ever. I don't know about your life or what you've been through. But have you only known boring genteel people your whole life? Take some risks man.You did extract a great performance out of Rebecca Hall. She really is a terrific actress. She did play the depressed and boring housewife to perfection. But what were you thinking while casting Jason Bateman? And what was up with your performance? You are a pretty good actor. But you had that beard on and went out of the way to make yourself look like a loser.Anyway, not a bad start. It was a pretty provocative and interesting story at the end of the day. I just wish you had more imagination.Best Regards, Pimpin.(4/10)",The Gift
96,ketgup83,Electrifying !!!,8,15 November 2015,"Much was said about the movie at its premier and I got the chance to watch it last week. To my surprise, I simply adored the film.The gift tells the story of a young couple who moves into a new house. However, their life goes haywire when an acquaintance of the husband comes back after a long gap of 20 years.Actor Joel Edgerton steps into the role of director and as first time, he impresses with his profile. The actor has done some good films including The Warrior and this year's The Black Mass with Johnny Depp but wearing the director's cap was moving out of his comfort and give us a wonderful picture. I will not go into the details since there are few twist and turns. The screenplay is tight keeping you engaged with crisp editing. Cinematography and art direction is nice. Dialogues are punching. It is again Joel Edgerton and Rebecca Hall who gives a mindblowing performance. Jason Bateman provides adequate support.Overall, a definite watch with enthralling story. Excellent 3/5",The Gift
97,areatw,I was on the edge of my seat!,9,30 July 2017,"'The Gift' is one of the most enthralling thrillers I've seen in a long time. It ticks all the boxes and has everything you would want in a mystery thriller film. The plot has you hooked from the start, it has an incredibly eerie feel to it and, like all good thrillers, it has a few big twists that most people won't see coming.Towards the end of the film, as the story unravels and a dramatic ending is set up, I was genuinely on the edge of my seat. Very rarely does a film grip me like 'The Gift' did. The ending is satisfying in that, unlike a lot of other thrillers, it felt like it had been well thought out and designed for maximum effect, rather than just a cheap way out.Overall, 'The Gift' was very impressive. It's not very often that a film has me hooked from the first scene to the last, but this one managed it. Probably one of the best thrillers of the 2010s.",The Gift
98,kevin c,Monkey business,6,21 March 2021,"Badged as a thriller, this is more of a study of bullying and its consequences.It only belatedly resorts to shock tactics and big melodramatic flourishes. It is a slow-burning, nuanced affair in which your perspective on the protagonists gradually shifts. Their attitude toward one another also shifts, as people discover how little they really know about each other.",The Gift
99,maurice_yacowar,childhood victim returns to wreak revenge,8,10 August 2015,"The Gift is a very effective genre thriller. Ah, but which genre? In dramatizing the amoral bullying in corporate culture it's a white-collar crime melodrama. Its explicit theme of the terrible costs of bullying makes it a social commentary. In interweaving the guilt and innocence of an apparently virtuous and an apparent evil, it ventures into Hitchcock territory — as emphasized by one eruption of shrill strings (a la Psycho). But the film draws most effectively upon the Woman's Film tradition — Rebecca, Gaslight, etc. — as a strong, fragile woman has her sanity thrown into doubt by two strong, scheming men. ""I'm not crazy,"" she assures herself as she watches her faith in her husband, her marriage and his career crumble together.Robyn (Rebecca Hall) was torn away from her Chicago home, career and independence to serve husband Simon's (Jason Bateman) ambitions in a California suburb. Left vulnerable by a miscarriage, she is further unsettled by the mysterious Gordo (Joel Edgerton, who also wrote and directed). He besieges the young couple with gifts, then undermines her confidence with suggestions of her husband's past misdeeds. Bateman plays against his persona when his amiable character is exposed to be a liar and a bully, who has no qualms about ruining someone else's life to get ahead. We learn he ruined Gordo's as a kid, but now as an adult destroys a rival with unfounded slander. Simon personifies male authority. As Gordo recalls, Simon used his name to bend others to his will, especially when he ran for students union president (always an omen of adult corruption). What Simon says, everyone did. We watch Simon tyrannize Robyn despite his obvious love for her.His glide through life ends here when Gordo wreaks a magnificent, ironic revenge. When Gordo was a child Simon led his schoolyard bullying and beating. He and a pal falsely accused young Gordo of being homosexually molested, which led to his near murder by his father and his derailment from any normal life. As if in atonement Simon's partner in crime became a chiropractor, as if to bring compensatory relief to the afflicted. Simon pursues a career in ""security systems,"" ironically apt for a man who builds his own security on causing the insecurity of others.In his revenge Gordo reverses that first crime. He poisons Simon's mind with the idea that Gordo raped and inseminated an unconscious Robyn. Gordon sends Simon a tape of the scene and of the couple's domestic conversations. This invasion humiliates the security systems specialist. Gordon undermines Simon entirely. Simon will always see Gordo's eyes in his new son. Having seen how badly Simon beat Gordo Robyn will not return to him or their house. In the last shot Gordo walks away blurred by hospital glass, tossing aside the arm brace he had worn to dramatize Simon's assault. The broken man has broken his nemesis. Robyn is trapped between the two men. As Gordo visits her when Simon is at work Simon suspects Gordo wants to take her from him. That's the insecurity of the bully. Perhaps from that anxiety Gordo gets the idea how to get back at his boyhood tormentor. He makes the bully's dread a reality. At the end nothing Simon says means anything. He loses not just his promotion but his job, his marriage — and any confidence his son is his and not Gordo's.",The Gift
100,aciessi,"Go Ahead, Open It.",8,14 August 2015,"""Let bygones be bygones"".Truly, out of the clear blue sky comes ""The Gift"", and it's the creepiest psychological thriller in ages. The sleeper hit of the summer. Joel Edgerton is amazing as Gordo. He really constructed a unique, extremely creepy, pathetic character for himself. You really don't know whether to feel bad for the guy, or just hate him for being so intrusive, and irrational. Jason Bateman is another big star here. In a rare turn, he goes completely dramatic, and he is spectacular. I want more serious Bateman. He has the workings of a master class actor, and Edgerton had the courage to pry that out of him. I was cringing in my chair, and having a ball the whole time.",The Gift

102,RforFilm,The Gift a real gift: half a scary thriller and other half intriguing character study,8,13 August 2015,"Don't you hate it when your on Facebook when you receive a friend request from some that that says they knew you in school, yet you draw a black when you try to remember them? Reconnecting with old friends or even people from school tends be something of an interest. While I may not flat out meet them for coffee to catch up, I at least like knowing if they made something of themselves. Did any student government officials ever go further in politics? Did the class poet ever try to publish something? Did the mathletee ever become an engineer. That's what social media pages are for these days. I also think about once high school ends, the positions of geek, bully, jock, and many other labels are suddenly dropped from your personality. When I see those old souls on Facebook, I try to see them as functional adults, yet part of me still sees their role from school. Even if the bully-like jock became a ballet dancer, I'd still see them as the jock more then anything. The story of The Gift is all about reconnections. Some reunions are nice while what we see here is much darker and sinister.A couple, Simon (played by Jason Bateman) and Robyn (played by Rachel Hall) has just moved from Chicago to Los Angeles with two purposes; Simon has accepted a new job and they're both getting away from a miscarriage that has troubled Robyn into prescription drugs. While getting some home decorations, Simon runs into Gordo (played by Joel Edgerton), an old high school classmate that was known as ""Gordo the Weirdo"". While a little socially awkward, Gordo seemed sound enough for Simon to say, ""I'll see you around"". Gordo pays a visit to Robyn, getting a tour of the house and is eve invited to have dinner. Gordo in return invites the couple to his place. Simon still senses some odd behavior from Gordo and promptly tells him that he doesn't want to be friends and doesn't want him at his house. In the next couple of days, Robyn become paranoid that Gordo may be targeting the couple as their dog goes missing and the koi fish in their pond are killed. Simon places all the blame on Gordo for being weird, but Robyn starts to get other sides of the story from other high school friends to understand something that she doesn't know about Simon. I have to stop there as I would ruin the full enjoyment for those that haven't seen The Gift. Most stalker stories tend to revolve around a strange character following someone until a fight ensures. This one throws more surprises and even plays around with conventions on how we see people. Perhaps are villains may be sound or maybe our heroes are truly evil. Joel Edgerton also wrote and directed this story that's not only scary, but intriguing with the many directions that it takes. Jason Bateman balances out his determined workaholic personality with his backstabbing attitude well enough for us to say that we know at least one person in out lives that act this way. Joel Edgerton is just as creepy, but enough of a sad guy that we feel sorry for him. I'm surprised to say that The Gift belongs to Rachel Hall. She is the buffer between Simon and Gordo and must act accordingly if she wants the truth. The gift feels a lot like a Hitchcock- esqe story much like Fatal Attraction. It's defiantly scary, but I would put this in the thriller- mystery category.I'll give this eight gift boxes out of ten. The Gift is truly a gift; it's half scary thriller and other half interesting character study. This is one of my biggest surprises of the summer. If you're spooked easily by this material, skip it, but I beg you to give it a chance.",The Gift
103,cultfilmfan,Joel Edgerton's The Gift,10,9 August 2015,"Joel Edgerton's The Gift (which he wrote, directed and co stars in) was certainly a film that took me by surprise. I had seen no trailers of the film and really knew nothing about it when going into the theatre. It was one of those films that comes along every once in awhile, where there is not a lot of media coverage, or promotion of said film and yet the critics are really liking it and once you go to see it, at the end you are just in shock in awe of what you had just seen, but at the same time, you liked every single minute of this film and it was a master class in every meaning of the word in terms of how thrillers should be done. I have since I was a teenager been a fan of thrillers/horror films and I watched several during that adolescent portion of my life and also got together a good size collection of films and memorabilia related to the genre. Over the years I found though, that the films from years ago from this genre, that they still appealed to me greatly and I still had a strong fondness for them, but the newer films coming out were just almost pathetic and certainly nothing to write home about. It seems all the really good films from years ago were now being remade into terrible remakes and once one idea was done then it would be recycled countless times and you would continue to get multiple remakes of the really good films and also an endless slew of unnecessary sequels to them. Trends have come and gone in this particular genre. I liked the slasher films of the 80's and 90's, but once we got to the last 15 years, or so, people started getting more lazy and what was considered ""hip"", or ""in"" at the time was just not something I was buying. I did not care for that whole ""torture"" series of horror films that after each film, one after the other they tried to out do one another with how vicious, nasty and gruesome they could be. Totally unappealing and worthless. I also never got into the Japanese horror films (with the exception of Takashi Miike's Audition). People screaming loudly into the camera and a lot of loud noises and bombastic musical scores did nothing for me either. The found footage genre had some interesting ideas (e.g. Cannibal Holocaust, The Blair Witch Project), but after awhile, everyone was using that technique and after awhile it wasn't new, fresh, or original anymore. I could go on, but won't due to limited space. What a breath of fresh air with Joel Edgerton's The Gift. Here is a thriller that knows how to do the film right and exceeds on all possible levels. The story at first glance may seem simple enough, but as the film goes on it becomes more and more involving and after a few twists and turns it really gets us on the edge of our seat and it was also one of those films that certainly stays with you lost after you have watched it and leaves both an impact on the viewer and leaves you thinking about it for a long time. This is also more of a thinking person's thriller as it really gets one pondering about human nature and how we treat each other as humans. I can not go into it any further as I don't want to spoil the film, but you really start to wonder who if anybody you are rooting through during this picture, which I think is the point and something to be applauded. There is not a single scene of graphic violence during the whole running time of the film and nor is it needed. The film is so involving and captivating and what it does not show us in terms of violence is all the more effective at creeping us out because it leaves more to the viewer's imagination and leaves us to guess and assume certain things which is even more powerful and at times scary than if they had gone the opposite route and been really violent, or gory. The film works as a good character study as we certainly get several good depictions of human nature and the effects we can have on one another. The film works as a human melodrama and we get caught up in the lives and actions of these characters and at times it almost plays out more like a drama film, but then we get back into the thriller mode of the film and it all comes together so brilliantly than the end result is fantastic. The direction and writing here from Edgerton is really impressive. He certainly knows how to concoct and craft an expertly done thriller and film and it is an extremely impressive directorial debut. The acting from Jason Bateman, Rebecca Hall and Edgerton himself is also all top notch and serves the film well. This was more of a smaller low key type of film, but I am so glad that it got a mainstream release and that people are going out and seeing it. This is the type of film you want to tell people about and have them see because of how good it is. This is certainly the finest film I have seen this Summer and I know it will be on my year end top films list. Highly recommended.",The Gift
104,Quietb-1,Unwrap and say thanks for The Gift.,8,12 August 2015,"Joel Edgerton gets all the credit and a bit of the blame for this adult thriller. A young couple are tormented by a man from his past. It has the usual set up things like the dead fish and missing dog. It has the house you know is not his, that you know is bugged. It is very dialogue driven with plenty of exposition that is spoken not shown. The monkey stuff seemed forced. It was good to see the ""Phantom of the Opera"" get a cameo. Eventually the movie takes a couple of fresh twists that makes revenge sweet.Perhaps the ultimate revenge was misdirected as it seemed that marriage was doomed and she had no part of the past issue.The characters were well written. Jason Bateman showed range and rage. Gordo could have had a better dye job. An over the top irate guy shows up at the exact needed time.Forget the flaws and go with it.

105,Anurag-Shetty,One of the best thrillers of all time!,10,24 August 2015,"The Gift tells the story of a married couple.

After they move to Los Angeles, Simon meets an old high school classmate named Gordo(Joel Edgerton). Simon introduces Gordo to Robyn. Gordo starts giving a number of gifts to the married couple. Gordo also shares a secret that turns Simon & Robyn's life, upside down. The Gift is a spectacularly crafted thriller. Though the audience may think they know who the real culprit is, this film will have you on the edge of your seat & will keep you guessing right till the end. The concept of the movie is unique & unnerving. Joel Edgerton excels in his directorial debut. Edgerton has managed to induce a growing feeling of dread, as the film progresses. Don't worry. There are a handful of jump scares in the movie too. Hats off to Edgerton for writing this fantastic & original script in a world of sequels, spin-offs & reboots. The three leads have given commendable performances. Jason Bateman is outstanding as Simon. It's refreshing to see Bateman, in a dramatic role for a change. Rebecca Hall is superb as Robyn. Hall portrays Robyn's paranoia & fear, effortlessly. Joel Edgerton is the star of the show as Gordo. Edgerton's subtle performance keeps the audience guessing as to the intentions of his character.

107,jrarichards,Not-bad morality tale-thriller,7,5 May 2016,"My family live on the second floor behind a strongly mounted and well-reinforced steel door with two (high-quality) locks on it. The windows are mostly small and triple-glazed, and of course inaccessible. Admittedly, there's a (pretty unclimbable) balcony, but the window has a bar behind it to give it better support against would-be intruders. We have net curtains and ordinary curtains. The neighbours have never been in, just as we have never been in their place. When we meet people it's at cafes, restaurants, the cinema, the theatre, the park, at a picnic, at the swimming pool. Maybe it sounds a bit miserable or cold, but it's really nothing atypical where we live, please believe me.Simon and Robyn Callum (known to us as Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall - here effortlessly playing an American) may or may not have lived in the above style while still in Chicago, but their move to California brings them to what Californians presumably see as a pretty ""des res"", and that means more glass than wall, no curtains to speak of, a wooden door with a readily-copiable key, set back from the road, plenty of surrounding shrubbery in which to hide, etc., etc. Lovers of ""The Walking Dead"", ""The Road"" and many other films are made pretty well aware of how indefensible most American dwellings are, and in Joel Edgerton's film ""The Gift"" this is a truth writ large. Of course, the behaviour that goes with the way of living is also casual and not very security-conscious, though as it happens residents may perhaps need protecting as much from people already in the house as from those outside! Anyway, this film scenario would have been a non-starter in many a European country, but in America (and especially California) it has everything going for it, and that makes it intriguing, though also a tad exotic in its premise for many of us! And of course there are a great many films out there, so who knows if ""The Gift"" will get particularly noticed, or will even deserve to be so? There's nothing really wrong with it, though, and indeed - having come across it pretty much by chance - I can quite recommend it. It's well-enough acted, reasonably creepy and atmospheric and it continues a trend of recent times in the way it has Bateman in ever-grittier roles. Here he's certainly no angel, and that's fun to watch in itself. Edgerton - an Australian though you wouldn't know it - stars in his own film as the third key character ""Gordo"", and there's a bit of chicken and egg thinking to be done when we out here in audience-land look at that character he's playing.Most of all, there's a message that hits home to many if not most of us, that being under 21 or under 18 never really absolved one of the need to be a decent human being. And that's a key message for those of us looking back to our schooldays either as those who took it, or as those who dished it out. Maybe it's a clichéd message, or maybe it actually isn't. Either way it can't be repeated often enough, and it would be interesting to wonder how small the percentage of former schoolkids who neither took it nor dished it out would actually be. Certainly what we find in this film (albeit in extreme form) is not an isolated issue or any kind of rarity at schools. And that's really just not good enough.",The Gift

Especially if you already have a bunch of socks in your drawer, which most of us do.So what I'm saying is that it's a little bit of a run of the mill 'stalker psychological drama thriller' but it's still a perfectly passable time-waster.Jason Bateman is mostly known for a comedic work where he usually plays a likable jokester, but here he's neither likable or a jokester, his character is actually rather arrogant and a bit of a douche and that's not spoiling anything because that's the behaviour he shows from the very start of the movie. And he plays that role well, as does Rebecca Hall and Joel Edgerton in their respective roles.The movie is kind of slow, so if you're expecting a thriller that will have you holding on to your seat you might want to look elsewhere, a couple of cheap jump-scares here and there but for the more part it takes it's time to develop the story.So yeah, watchable but nothing amazing.",The Gift

112,CANpatbuck3664,"Very Tense Thriller, Definitely More Going On Then Meets The Eye",9,3 January 2016,"Even though this movie did well at the box office, I feel like it could have done even more business if they had marketed it better. The trailer makes it look like a generic thriller flick, where you can see the twists coming from a mile away and you hear people whispering about who did it a half hour into the feature. The thing is The Gift is a lot more than that, it moves a quick pace after it takes time to set up its characters, it creates interesting characters and it comes to a very satisfying conclusion. It's a good entry into a genre that doesn't produce many interesting movies which was a nice ""gift"" for sure.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Robyn (Rebecca Hall) and Simon Callum (Jason Bateman) are relocating into Los Angeles and we start with them viewing what will be their new home. In some ways they seem like an idealistic couple, they clearly have money and are looking to start a family but something still isn't right, Robyn is shown looking forlorn at a baby mobile she unpacks and while she's walking around the new neighbourhood she moves slowly and quietly even though she befriends her new neighbours. Soon after they are out shopping and a man comes up to them saying he knew Simon from high school. It takes Simon a couple of seconds but he recognizes him as Gordon ""Gordo"" Mosely (Joel Edgerton). The two exchange awkward pleasantries and while Robyn is friendly, Simon seems eager to leave but they exchange phone numbers and a promise to have dinner some time. Soon after, they find a bottle of wine outside their door with a bow on it with a welcome to the city note on it from Gordo. They decide to invite him to dinner shortly after.I assume that looking at the bare bones of the plot, there isn't a lot to be impressed with, which is understandable. But as stated above, there's more than meets the eye here and the plot slowly morphs into a different beast entirely. At the beginning, there is more setup and it moves slower but when it hits its gear, it really takes off. There are twists to be had and they're wonderfully done. The film definitely promotes a message that I don't want to give away but it does it well and it's a good message. I was interested throughout and I was appreciative that they went for the psychological thriller as opposed to horror. They took the high road and it made for a more interesting experience.Where I think this movie really shines is in the complex characters it creates. When introduced to Gordo, he's tailor made to be the antagonist. He's awkward and weird looking, his social grace is off and he keeps showing up uninvited to bother Robyn even if his intentions aren't sinister. But it's not the case, because as we learn more about Simon, he isn't the idealistic white collar husband we assume he is (partly due to the great casting of Jason Bateman). By the end of the movie there's a legitimate argument to be had over who really is the bad guy. Robyn is more than just a bystander of a character as well and although she's largely at the mercy of these two men she's really the eyes and ears of the audience, she has dimension as well and you might find yourself wondering what she had done from a karma perspective to end up in this awful situation.From an acting perspective, there's some great performances here. I thought Jason Bateman did a really great job playing against type. At the beginning we think he might be the usual straight man character but it ends up being something with a lot more weight. There are some times where he can be downright frightening and that's due to his committed acting. I hope he gets more parts where he can show his range. Joel Edgerton is also good playing against type and the fact he's pulling triple duty as a writer/director/actor makes it just that much more impressive. Rebecca Hall has the smallest part of the 3 but she holds up her end and rounds out 3 sterling lead performances.I decided to watch this movie after I saw the great reviews it has achieved and I would like to echo those reviews here. This movie was a big surprise and I hope it finds the audience it deserves. Joel Edgerton really knocked it out of the park and I hope he gets the opportunity to make more movies, this is a hell of a first effort. If this movie sounds like it could be something you're interested it, I recommend you check it out when you can.",The Gift
113,Laakbaar,Arrogance and revenge,8,18 February 2016,"This is a psychological thriller about a successful couple who run into a man from the husband's past. The man seems sorta off, sorta weird -- even though he's perfectly nice -- so we're left with the feeling that, well, he is probably a psycho. This is a movie, after all. Our suspicions seem confirmed, at first. But then the film changes directions, and we understand better what's going on. The wife starts to find out the sordid history between these two men, and she doesn't like what she finds out. But then the movie changes direction once again...No, there's no horror scenario behind it all. Just a morally slippery slope and human arrogance and, well, revenge. This movie speaks to us because many of us carry baggage from our school days. We don't like to talk about it, but it's still there. I think this movie also captures what happens when we have a relationship with someone and start finding out the grimy details.Even though the California setting comes across as perfectly typical and mundane, the sense of foreboding, menace and tension in the movie is expertly delivered to the movie goer. What is Gordo going to do? What is going on actually? Everyone's performance is this film is excellent. Edgerton in particular. It blew me away when I found out later that he also directed the movie. What an intelligent, talented man he must be. He has this way of giving his characters depth, an unusual, unpredictable edge. His evil characters are not black or white.

114,dfa120374,A Very Enjoyable Psychological Thriller,7,27 November 2015,"I'd just like to start off by saying well done to Joel Edgerton for making his first major directorial project a very good, gripping psychological thriller. One that was also written & produced by him as well, and hopefully any future projects he's involved with can be as good as The Gift.The only thing about the film is that it's actually pretty slow for about the first 30 minutes or so, and there are moments where you do wonder if it would ever pick up. Thankfully it does, but not so much in the pace as it's never supposed to be a fast-paced movie. It's the story itself and the increase in tension that picks up...the direction that the story goes in, the anticipation of things to come, and the overall feel of how things all pan out are all done really nicely.For me, the way the film's written is made to keep you on the edge & to keep watching and it succeeds in doing just that, all the way up to the nice wee twist at the end. In my opinion, anyone who says that the whole film was boring either never watched the whole film or just wasn't paying attention because it's anything but boring.The film is also very well acted with Jason Bateman, Rebecca Hall, and Joel Edgerton all delivering excellent performances. I've not seen many Bateman movies, but from what I have seen of them, the role of Simon in The Gift is far from anything he's probably played before. By the time the movie has ended, you end up feeling more resentment towards Simon that you do towards Gordo. Well, I did at least. In fact, I felt absolutely no sympathy towards Simon. Edgerton plays Gordo, a quiet loner who you end up feeling sorry for more than you maybe should and Hall plays Simon's wife, Robyn, who's eventually caught up between feeling sorry for Gordo and resentment for Simon as she finds out more about his past.Well written, well acted, and well directed...the whole film is an example of how good a psychological thriller should be.",The Gift

116,asda-man,GOod loRDO! A terrific thriller,8,26 September 2015,"I think The Gift managed to slip under everyone's radar. There hasn't been a really great ad campaign so you'd only know about it if you were quite the film fan, or had been impressed by the cheap trailers which make it look like your average scraping-the-barrel-type thriller. I actually went into The Gift completely blind. I didn't watch any trailers, skimmed a couple of reviews and didn't even really know what the story was about. It was a spontaneous trip to my local cinema I made on the day and I was very glad that I made it.I think the less you know about The Gift, the better! In fact, I've just watched the theatrical trailer for it now and it gives way too much away. It also makes it look like a run-of-the-mill horror film, which it really isn't. The Gift is a Hitchcockian thriller of the classiest kind. It starts out conventionally enough with a young couple moving into a new house blah blah blah, but the our heroes bump into a mysterious man called Gordo, an old school friend of Jason Bateman. This first encounter fills the film with mystery and intrigue which keeps it utterly gripping.It's very difficult to talk about The Gift without giving the plot away and I don't want to ruin it for anybody. Suffice to say that Joel Edgerton has revealed himself to be quite the talent. His screen writing skills are extremely impressive. Instead of throwing in clichés and outlandish plot twists, he's built the film on a story unfolding naturally with realistic characters. In fact, it's the characters which really made the film for me. They're developed so beautifully and logically whilst still remaining grounded. By the end of the film it feels like Simon and Gordo are real people.The fantastic acting also contributes to the feeling of realism. At times, Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall felt like a real couple having real arguments and doing real couply things! It's a shame that Rebecca Hall isn't used more in the world of films. I've only really seen her in The Prestige and she was equally great in that, plus she's not too harsh on the eyes either. Joel Edgerton steals the show as Gordo though. He's creepy, funny, mysterious and yet strangely likable. I suppose it depends on your type of character, but I also sympathised with Gordo like Rebecca Hall did.Joel Edgerton also proves himself to be a dab hand behind the camera too. It's difficult to believe that this is his feature length debut because it's directed in such a confident and classy manner. He certainly knows how to craft an effective jump scare! There are two moments which absolutely made me jump out of my skin! I was worried for the couple of grannies I sat next to; I think their nerves were completely shot by the end of it all. I found there to be tension throughout the film which made it a riveting thing to watch from start to finish.I also loved how focused the film was, especially at the beginning. Every scene pushes the plot forward, but in a natural way and not a forced one. Simon, Robyn and Gordo become our sole focus and we feel immersed in their lives. As the film goes on it manages to dig deeper and deeper into the characters which results in an astonishing finale which had my heart pounding. It could've easily slipped into a fun, yet conventional thriller finale in the vein of Cape Fear or Single White Female, but Joel decides to hit the audience harder by going taking a different route which completely pays off.The Gift came as a total surprise to me. I was expecting it to be good from all the positive ratings from critics, but it turned out to be great. It's an enthralling ride which manages to be intense and thrilling without sacrificing superb character development and subverting audiences' knowledge of the genre. It's a shame it hasn't become a bigger hit, because it really does deserve to be one. It's everything you could want in a thriller and I shall anticipate the next film Joel churns out.",The Gift
117,SquigglyCrunch,Creepy and Well-Written,8,23 November 2015,"This movie was one that I was very excited to see, but unfortunately it was a little harder to find then I thought it would be so I didn't watch it until now. I'm pleased to say that it did not disappoint. I went into The Gift with almost no idea what it was about. I'd seen the ratings, the cover, the content advisory, and the word 'stalker' at some point. So I had little to no idea what I was getting into. The plot was very interesting. It's relatively simple, but the characters really drive it forward. The characters are noticeably amazing from the beginning. The actors are great, and the characters act and feel like real people. From the get-go they're all authentic and engaging. You want to hate some of them, but they're so relatable that it's difficult to do so. They're easily the best part of the movie. The tone set by the movie is great, and so is the pacing. It never feels slow, and it seems to get darker throughout. It doesn't follow the regular movie formula, which is a little surprising considering this is Joel Edgerton's first full-length movie. That fact makes it all the more impressive that he actually pulled this off. Overall The Gift is nothing short of fantastic. The plot is great, the characters are superb, and the tone and pacing are very well done. In the end I wouldn't hesitate to recommend The Gift to anyone. If the word 'stalker' interests you as a movie, then take a look. I really hope you won't regret it.",The Gift
118,johannes2000-1,"Solid, well acted thriller.",8,5 May 2021,"I liked it. There are plenty movies about weirdo's that stalk and threaten innocent families, so you have to come up with some pretty solid material to stand out. Well, that is definitely the case here. The script is intelligent and thrilling, there are some surprising twists and the tension is cleverly built up to an original climax. I loved it that in this movie the victim isn't really that innocent and the perpetrator isn't really that bad, it makes the story less one-dimensional than in comparable movies.The acting is fine, Jason Bateman gives his usual professional performance, it comes so natural that it doesn't even impress as acting. Rebecca Hall was very convincing as his increasingly scared, distrustful and exasperated wife.",The Gift
119,billygoat1071,Surprising New Spin,9,20 August 2015,"At glance, The Gift looks like a by-the-numbers thriller with generic characters, generic antagonist and a terribly predictable plot. But the best thing about this movie is it isn't by-the-numbers. It takes a rather clichéd story into smarter directions that aren't usually considered in most from the genre lately. The movie thinks deeper within its tricks, character work and even some thematic potential. Though it didn't leave any mind blowing conclusion, but most of the experience is filled with intriguing turns, helping to make the suspense even more effective.The film picks up, seems to be lacking any freshness: the main characters, Simon and Robyn, get a new home, new job, new life. It's a perfect new start until they meet a person who is a potential threat. Though, this person happens to be a classmate, Gordo, who was bullied by Simon in the past, which also hints this as a revenge thriller. But as predictable as this premise sounds, the movie just keeps turning to smarter twists; it's clear that Gordo is hiding a secret behind his hospitality, but the story also acknowledges that there are more conflicts around than just a psychopath who could destroy them. Example is Robyn's anxiety towards the possible intentions of Gordo. The other is Simon's attitude that can't seem to go away. It often avoids the obvious and brings shades of gray with these characters to keep the mysteries complex and unpredictable.And so, it keeps establishing their history and their true colors, it's mostly the most interesting aspects of the entirety, it's basically just the character work building up as the storyline goes. And then it goes to a twisted finale which sort of drops the ball. Though , we still didn't see this coming and it's done with a slow burn of suspense, but this turn is rather forced in bringing the terror and the message for a consequence built up this terrifically. But it didn't quite ruin the movie. The key is its subtle character-work. Thrillers often suffers with absurd characters. Here, these are some of the rare that can be reasonable human beings, even the antagonist himself.The direction is nicely constructed as well. The camera shots make the main characters' house look vulnerable; bringing a sense of danger with the villain potentially showing up at their windows, which leveling up the tension. Joel Edgerton thankfully doesn't chew the scenery as Gordo and stays grounded at the role's sociopathic behavior, which makes him either more terrifying or empathetic. Jason Bateman brings depth to a supposedly regular guy that makes you dubious about his innocence or something. Rebecca Hall explores her role's pathos, but also naturally displays curiosity and fear around their situation.The Gift is surprisingly one of the smartest thrillers came out in a while. It doesn't stray from reality, well almost, and yet it still brings us a good enough amount of fun suspense. Another notable merit deserving to be mentioned again is the character-work. It goes deep into their psychology and sometimes, the sociopathic Gordo isn't always the antagonist of their problems. It's not generally about violence or deaths or horror (well, again, almost.) It could be themselves, or their fear of having no absolute safety from their consequences. This is an aim that we don't usually see from a standard thriller and encountering this makes it excitingly fresh. Plus the direction is slick, the production is stunning and the acting is pretty great; it shows that Edgerton could handle filmmaking better than acting. I mean really, this terrifically constructed storyline is what makes it remarkable and engrossing.",The Gift
120,Rickting,An unexpectedly solid thriller and a good directional debut for Joel Edgerton,7,1 May 2016,"The Gift is written and directed by Joel Edgerton, and stars him alongside Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall. Despite relatively little hype, TG proved to be one of the better thrillers of the year, and despite the familiar material it manages to feel fresh. The story of a married couple being stalked by a man who keeps bringing mysterious gifts and brings back a haunting secret from the husband's past. No-one necessarily expected much from this, but it is good. Personally, I felt critics were a bit over-enthusiastic about the film. Since it mainly involves just 3 actors, it feels incredibly low key which prevents it from being a film one can get truly excited about. The film, while maintaining a high level of unpredictable tension throughout, can't quite deliver a satisfying ending. The ending is anticlimactic and the last part of the film feels somewhat chaotic since too much stuff happens. Still, the ending is good enough and unexpected, and it doesn't undo what came before. TG shows Edgerton as a good director, but it's the writing here that truly impresses. This is a very clever, twisty and unpredictable thriller that constantly keeps the audience guessing. It does get very tense at times, even when nothing much is happening and the number of twists Edgerton manages to think up is truly impressive. He's very good in the film, and aided excellently by Rebecca Hall and Jason Bateman. It's not a perfect movie, but it's a solid thriller. If you like twists, this is the film for you.7/10",The Gift
121,rubenm,Entertaining movie with lots of suspense,7,29 November 2015,"'The Gift' is a psychological thriller in the true sense of the word. It's all about psychology: at the end of the film, the lead characters are completely different persons from who they seemed to be at the beginning. The hero becomes the villain, and vice versa.Not many directors can pull this off in a believable way, but Joel Edgerton does it perfectly. Every development is logical and the screenplay is constructed in an extremely clever way. It centres on Robyn, a housewife who slowly discovers that her husband not only hides episodes from his past from her, but also is a very different sort of person from the one she thought he was. The truth is slowly uncovered because a person from the past turns up on their doorstep, and makes Robyn question her husband's statements.There are no unnecessary sidelines, so the story stays focused and the viewer is constantly challenged to reassess his view on what he sees happening. Even at the very end, there is a nice twist to make the viewer keep on questioning if what he thinks happened, really happened. This is a very entertaining movie with lots of suspense.",The Gift

123,bregund,"By the 90s, we all got tired of these psychological thrillers",4,14 August 2016,"It's not hard to classify this film, it looks like it was made in 1988. The idea of a clingy psychopath with unresolved emotional issues has already been done to death in the 1980s, which is why it's so surprising to see the theme resurface in a film made in 2015. This topic has already been well covered, and The Gift doesn't do anything that Fatal Attraction already did a million times better, and with better actors. Let's just say that the only way Jason Bateman will ever win an Oscar is if it happened accidentally.Character motivations and backgrounds aren't clearly defined in this film, and the end result is a murky, unresolved mess. Simon is either a protagonist or antagonist, depending on how you look at things, or if you would even care by the unsatisfying end of the film. Robyn leaves her husband for a flimsy reason. Gordo gets his sort-of revenge, sort of, or maybe not. Showtime's description of this film contained the word ""terrifying"", so I suppose it is terrifying to come home to dead fish, since animal deaths always happened in these films back in the 80s. Robyn invites a man she barely knows into her house, while she's all alone, I don't know of any woman who would do that. Gordo's background is never defined, and surprisingly made even less defined after Greg sort-of explains what Simon did to Gordo, sort of. Or maybe not.

An hour in and you still haven't a clue how it's going to end (that's a good thing).
The character development is fantastic and really fits in with the ending of this film also. A lot of the character actions start making sense as all is revealed.The ending: it's a good enough ending, it's left really open ended but still ends if that makes sense. In my opinion it's a little too open ended for my liking, but I can acknowledge that it does work.To finish. It's a good little thriller. Little slow here and there and an open ended ending is why it's a 7/10 and not a bit higher.

Like, what if your partner really was a cruel tormentor and bully at school? Enter psychological thrillers to taunt us with the big reveal that can pull the carpet from under our emotional lives. The Gift does this slowly and brilliantly.The storyline is simple. Take-no-prisoners corporate-type Simon and his anxious wife Robyn have just acquired some nice property in a nice Los Angeles neighbourhood and they bump into one of Simon's old schoolmates, Gordo. That's cordial enough, but Gordo keeps inviting himself into their lives, first with house-warming gifts then with dinners and so on. Simon never liked the ""weirdo"" but Robyn is taken by his needy charms, and once the rift is set in motion, the tension continues to rise as Gordo keeps re-surfacing where Simon does not want him. The three-way acting is superbly taut, with Simon's arrogance, Robyn's fears and Gordo's inexplicable presence linked as if by a high-tension wire that keeps shifting in the wind as we do not know who is the bad guy and who is the good. And Gordo's offer to ""let bygones be bygones"" keeps ringing in our ears.Effective psychological thrillers employ elementary principles of knowledge deprivation and disorientation, and this film gives no clear signal about who we can trust. The atmosphere of threat and uncertainty is accentuated by noir lighting, staccato camera-work, and close-up framing on widened eyes that spell fear. It keeps twisting and turning in unexpected directions, pulling the hidden story together and leading Robyn towards the big reveal. Like in all great thrillers we are not sure until the last few seconds and a finale that Hitchcock would have loved.",The Gift
126,avik-basu1889,A very solidly made psychological thriller !!!,8,24 September 2016,"'The Gift' marked Joel Edgerton's directorial debut. He also wrote and starred in the film alongside Rebecca Hall and Jason Bateman. For a first time director, this is a very solid, admirable and promising piece of work.Edgerton's writing is intricate. He interweaves a number of themes together very well while creating a general structure. First of all he uses the premise of the past actions having a huge bearing on the present. The film delves into the theme of bullying and how much of an impact bullying can have on the victim throughout his/her life. Edgerton takes this concept of bullying and merges it with the work culture in the modern corporate world. He shows how people who were once bullies during their school days can continue with their bullying in their professional work to be successful. Edgerton's film is a bit of a damning indictment on corporate culture where these bullies and their bullying get rewarded more often than not. When it comes to direction, Edgerton has a great sense of how to use an enclosed location to amplify the tension, because at the heart of it, 'The Gift' is a thriller that thrives on the creation of tension. Edgerton uses the house that Simon and Robyn move in to brilliantly in the tension-filled scenes. I also noticed some subtle use of blocking that he uses. Specially in the kitchen scenes, there is a bit of a rectangular opening in the wall which gets uses quite subtly whenever there is a argument happening between husband and wife. However the moment in the film that stayed with me will be an image that comes very early on in the film. As Robyn and Simon are checking out the different rooms in this new house that they are considering to move into, there is a shot where we see Robyn and Simon facing each other with a glass sliding door separating them. Simon slides open the door and Robyn moves out the door to join Simon oh his side and walks off. This moment in a thematic sense, is a foreshadow for the whole film and it's a brilliant moment.The acting is also very good. For me the best performance in the film comes from Rebecca Hall. She shows the right amount of grace, likability and vulnerability to portray the character of Robyn and sells her paranoia very convincingly. Jason Bateman once again shows that he can be so much more than just a comedic actor. He showed this in 'Disconnect' and now in 'The Gift' he again shows a different side to his personality. Edgerton himself plays the character who initially seems like the typical creepy outsider who'll haunt the couple, but as the film progresses, the film slowly reveals certain aspects of his character and the film somewhat subverts some clichés.'The Gift' is a bit like the lighter, non-flashy, a little more grounded version of 'Cape Fear'. It does not achieve greatness, but it is certainly a solid, well made thriller especially considering this is Edgerton's first outing as a director. Recommended.",The Gift

128,dcarsonhagy,Return To Sender,6,14 November 2015,"""The Gift"" is an above-average, taut little thriller. It is an example that good writing, good editing, and good acting will do far more for a film than buckets of blood, caricatures, and a director lacking an opposable thumb.It tells a story of a couple (Simon and Rebecca) who have begun a new life since Simon (played by Jason Bateman) has found a new job. His wife is trying to become pregnant because they want the ""American Dream"" of a new environs, better job, a family, and life away from the big city. Everything seems to be right on track until a chance meeting of a former classmate of Simon's sets lives on a collision course. I am not going to give away any more of the plot than I already have. All the previews for television and in the movies have said, ""the ending will haunt you."" I kinda' disagree with that. After certain events take place, I am sure you will be able to figure out what's going to happen LONG before the final box is opened. It was refreshing to see a movie that actually told a good story, had some real tension, and a decent ending.The movie is rated ""R"" for language and minimal violence. It's not the be-all-end-all the trailers would lead you to believe it is, but it was entertaining.",The Gift
129,bob_meg,"If you're expecting the usual psycho stalker revenge flick, think again",10,16 September 2015,"In a terminally stale genre such as the revenge movie, writer/director/actor Joel Edgerton (who plays Gordo) offers up a breath of fresh air in ""The Gift."" It's refreshing also to see the high marks the film has gotten from both critics and audiences as it takes literally every payback convention we've all committed to cinematic memory and turns them around --- often aiming them back at us --- and that may irritate some, but I thought it made the movie far creepier and immediate than something like ""The Boy Next Door"" or any other Blank-from-hell genre flick.It's probably the only film in this genre where I can remember cheering on the anti-hero, as he's played with such damaged low-key charm by Edgerton. Jason Bateman similarly downplays his role as ""victim"" to serve a much greater cause, namely exposing his own character's calloused humanity with just the right dose of frailty so that you don't completely detest him.The whole tone of the film is one of quiet eeriness, and the few jolts that do come are much more potent because of it. There's no screaming score or screeching sound effects here. Even the tiring sadistic ""murdered pet"" trope is cleverly subverted.It all drives home the fact that often threats that you merely fear are far more potent than the ones you wind up facing down. The Gift effectively plays with our minds as well as it does the two protagonists'. It's a confident, classy thriller that gets under your skin and will have you looking over your shoulder for days to come, wondering if perhaps *you* have a Gordo waiting in the shadows from your own past, even if you might not think you do.",The Gift

Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall are also OK in their role. Good atmosphere.The film has its flaws. It was obviously influenced by psychological thrillers and revenge movies such as Pacific Heights, Cape Fear, Fatal Attraction, Straw Dogs and especially Oldboy.

Here, they are Jason Bateman, Rebecca Hall and Joel Edgerton, and the dark drama they bring to life is driven by dialogue and unexpected character development, instead of jump scares and dark hallways and other conventional thriller conventions. (Edgerton, who I last saw as a boilerplate good guy in 2011's ""The Thing"" prequel, is also the director here.) The three actors are magic together. I became uncomfortable (as was the filmmaker's intention) even during the first apparently innocuous conversation when the three interact for the first time at a chance meeting in a department store.In fact, I'm not sure that ""The Gift"" is even a thriller instead of a particularly disturbing drama. Like other viewers, I'd suggest that what filmgoers see is not what the movie's trailer suggests. This is yet another film that reviewers can't describe in detail for fear of spoilers.I'd give this a 9 out of 10. My only criticisms are very mild. I think Bateman underplayed the distress his character ought to have felt in the last 10 minutes or so. Also, I found myself wanting more closure and less ambiguity in the ending, as well a more of a standard climax. But that probably just reflects my expectations as a traditional horror-thriller fan, and not any real failings of the movie.",The Gift
132,James_De_Bello,7.5/10,7,12 January 2016,"A hell of ride. A rare thriller that defies many genre clichés and conventions. Even more than that, it is a masterful directorial debut that makes Joel Edgerton one of the most interesting new directors of the year and an artist for whom to look forward to in the future.The best aspect of the film which I simply can't keep in me is how good is the performance Edgerton gives considering also he is directing himself. It is the single most important ingredient to making this film succeed and it played to perfection. The way in which he conveys creepy and unsettling in a subtle manner makes everything around him better, it adds a whole layer of tension and interest in the characters that could have really missed in lesser hands.Still, that's not all the film has to offer. The directorial touches are smart and engaging, the characters development is original and surprising. Bottom line this is just a very, very good screenplay that can be dissected and studied for all the brilliance with which it is built. It seems like a perfect puzzle, with all the character beats into place, culminating in an edge-of-your-seat finale where I found myself screaming at the screen.Unfortunately, as much as I said in my introduction that the film manages to stray away from many clichés, it does fall into some tropes that have been used before. It is slightly derivative and because of that it doesn't reach quite ""Gone Girl"" level, by that I mean a thriller which is absolutely tense to the point of sickening for all of its duration. That may also be due to the fact that the thematic aspects the film is putting forward never emerge. Stuckmann said in his review that the film is about ""how one little, small thing one person says at the right moment can change everything"". I get where he is coming from, but I didn't find the movie to treat that fascinating aspect as much as I wanted. It could have done with being an edge more nasty and could have brought an unparalleled anxiety with it.But I am really dragging here. This is a fantastic thriller, one of those movies which I wish there were more of. It is inspiring to see such a confident debut, of which I can't wait to see more of.",The Gift
133,scottshak_111,"A beautiful direction, even better than most",7,31 August 2015,"Hats off to Joel Edgerton for his big debut as a fully-fledged director. Not only is his direction outstanding, but it is also better than most of the directors out there. His frames have an order, have the right amount of focus and they complement the score quiet beautifully. The Gift unfurls gorgeously into a story which can't be predicted at first. It breathes on a little suspense that coils around the question 'Why'? Then as we progress halfway, things become a little clearer and the why gets answered. You see the true face of perversion there, and suddenly your heart brims up with sympathy. The cast has done a great job by their majestic acting skills. Bateman and Joel are beautifully complemented by Rebecca Hall, and they all end up nailing it to perfection.The plot is not quite intricate exactly, a little predictable when you see the end coming. But it is gorgeously wrapped under the threads of a thriller. It is very nicely written and eases quite brilliantly into the ""Bullying"" waters, an issue that still prevails in the society and the hunter in us never gives a damn. The Gift is all about one big bad vengeance, which skims a little horror as it progresses. The music is good and the silence is deafening too. A couple of quick surprises make your heart skip a beat. What is however hard to swallow is the fact that the casting chose Jason Bateman to do the job of a bully. But if you look at it, the director intended to show a character that people would have trouble putting a pin to. And Joel milked this incredulity just fine. Some things that Edgerton misses out on are screenplay and subtlety. I wished the screenplay to pack in a little bit more punch. Also, the movie could have done a tad more with the suspense building as things start to become quite apparent. SPOILERS AHEAD:If you start to question the last bit of the movie, where Robyn had already decided to leave Simon, then even if Simon didn't know whose baby it was, it wouldn't have mattered much. Let us just say both end up getting divorce, the indifference of Simon towards the baby would have given Robyn the true custody. Okay, it did shatter him and break him but was Gordo's revenge really worth it? It was, if Simon really loved Robyn beyond limit, but given the limited romance time shown in the movie and confined relationship manifestation, things weren't exactly palpable.

Between his directing and also Jason Bateman turning in a great performance as the lead, this movie shines. It may be another revenge type story but the ending leaves it in a way that isn't so cut and dry (don't you wish sometimes I would just give spoilers?)

Excellently directed and very well acted,this clever little well - wrapped gift is all we need to let us know that the proper movie making process is still alive and kicking. Very few special effects and perfect use of sound( or lack of it in some cases) with 1 or 2 shocks to keep us going,it carries a clear message of our past waiting to wreck our future. I think it cleverly slows pace half way through then wakes up in the last third.Grab it while you can guys cos this will just go after a week or 2.",The Gift
136,troyputland,"Edgerton the writer, actor and director.",9,16 October 2015,"Joel Edgerton directs, writes and stars in The Gift, and a gift is exactly what he's given us. Edgerton is 'Gordo', a creepy, awkward fellow who becomes infatuated with Simon (Bateman) and Robyn (Hall), leaving gifts at their doorstep and turning up to their house unannounced. Simon he knew at school, and wants Gordo out of their lives, whilst his wife, although unnerved by him, thinks he's just being nice. Little do we know that Simon has a secret. The Gift is more than just an epic game of cat and mouse. This is a thriller with twists and turns like never seen before. Simon and Robyn's worlds are only turned upside down when Gordo's told to back off. Edgerton's directorial debut is astounding and truly gripping, a slow burner that rises and then explodes at the end.",The Gift
137,jmoneyjohal,A delightful dark film. Summers best film thus far.,8,14 August 2015,"I am disappointed in myself this is because it took me a week after the release of the Gift to watch it. The film is easily the best film i have seen this summer. From the onset the film has a creepy dark aura about it, and though the films pace is slow, the film is like slow poison by the time it hits you at the end, with its twisted suspenseful climax you are left with your foot in your mouth in awe.The film is a suspense thriller with a hint of horror also. And the best thing about the film is you cant guess any of the twists, the film keeps on the hook, the end is just so satisfying. The film tells the story of a couple moving from Chicago to LA, to get a new start after the Husband, Simon gets a new job with a new security company, and his wife who is a interior designer, is dealing with a loss of a baby. She has some type of anxiety problem also. After settling in there new home, Simon in a creepy weird encounter while shopping with his wife, meets an old friend from High school Gordo. Gordo is a weird, awkward mysterious character, who after the first encounter some how finds Simons address and visits his house many times with Gifts each time. He usual went to house when his wife was there and helped out around the house. At once instance he was even invited for dinner with couple. Simon and his wife soon feel creeped out by his over friendly and weird demeanor. When Gordo invites the couple to his house for dinner,Simon lets him know that they don't want his friendship.In anger Gordo kidnaps there dog, and kills the fish he gifted them. After phoning the cops they soon find out Gordo's house they went wasn't his, and after Simon's wife Robyn does a little research she finds out a dark secret about her husband that has to do with Simon. What is the secret is what forms the crux of the rest of the film. To find out more rush to the theatres.Acting wise Joel Edgerton steals the show, what an amazing, he is creepiness gives goosebumps.His career best. Jason Bateman is great in the non comic role, its refreshing too see.Rebecca Hall is superb as the strong headed wife.Overall like they say a good script is above anything,king is content. The film might be slow, but with an amazing script in hand Joel Edgerton has delivered the summers best film thus far. When Edgerton walks off in the climax you will feel like clapping. A thought provoking suspense thriller, that teaches what goes around comes around!4/5* or 8/10",The Gift
138,michaelradny,A Gift To Surprise All,9,26 August 2015,"The Gift delivers from the get go. At the start you are constantly guessing who this mysterious person is, and after a few sinister moments, the twist will really take you by surprise. The acting is phenomenally good, but more, the story is actually very much original, fantastic, engaging and entertaining. It's extremely psychological, taking you down the road of paranoia and further depression, guilt and torment. The greatest thing about this film is, however, the way the director structured the characters for you to, eventually, make the changes in your beliefs about the people you don't truly know. The Gift is great, and it does something that I haven't seen be done in a film before, that is, make you feel the same way one of the characters feels. This doesn't feel like a movie, it feels like a multi-dimensional exploration through the people that can destroy lives.",The Gift
139,ritera1,Ended up very disappointed (spoilers),6,12 September 2015,"I was there waiting for a good surprise ending, but was robbed!Good acting, pacing, script, and direction almost throughout. But after the terrible ending, the rotten apples popped up.1. How does the wife have no clue about her husband? He's never done the backstabbing earlier that he does in Los Angeles? He's a clear jackass after meeting Gordo. This was not his first rodeo.2. Two coincidences in a row. Run into Bateman and discover his address during such. No.3. Wife has a pill problem and passes out but nothing is really made of it. And was the dream an erotic dream? Was she infatuated with Gordo?4. The dog comes back (I'm sure via Gordo) but no word back on what happened to the fish after the police bagged it?5. What exactly was the time-line on Bateman's smear victim turning the tables on Bateman and how? Very vague. Gordo is now a computer hacker? If Bateman is so bad at this, it didn't end him earlier? And it was outside the realm of the original revenge story and kind of irrelevant.6. And earlier we see Bateman telling the story to the executives about Gordo in that he did something but didn't tell his wife. Was he telling the truth? What kind of story was he telling where the bosses still liked him?7. It would have been easy to determine if the child was his via DNA testing (cheek swab). There was no real lesson there.At the end of the day it was about revenge. Gordo wanted to teach a lesson. But it was a haphazard and unfocused lesson.Gordo apparently drugged the wife's Gatorade, but was his timing that good? He was there so long that she eventually got around to the right bottle at the right time?And if he bugged the house, why didn't he anticipate that Bateman was going to come see him at the karaoke bar? And if he did and was so clever, why didn't he have the camera running when Bateman beat him up?When exactly did Gordo also get the key to copy? She was good about locking the doors. (And nevermind the complete absence of a security system.) Did he have the key early on when he kidnapped the dog and got to the 'fridge to spike the drink?There were better and more clever endings available. I would have loved them explore the paradox between Bateman the bad guy and Bateman the loving husband.",The Gift
140,luke-a-mcgowan,"Its uncomfortable for half, and then Edgerton seizes you in an iron grip and doesn't let go. Its a thriller in every sense of the word",8,1 September 2015,"From the first shot of The Gift, I felt uncomfortable. That feeling does not go away for the entire runtime of Joel Edgerton's thrilling directorial debut. Edgerton has taken a worn out premise and delivered something deliciously wicked that will challenge your perceptions of its characters and its plot.In this one film, Edgerton has emerged as the new Ben Affleck on the block. He knows how to work a script (some of the dialogue is so well written that you don't even appreciate that its fiction), he knows how to construct a scene, and boy does he give a performance far beyond anything I've ever seen of him. He completely becomes Gordo (hiding behind a creepy mask of facial hair and contact lenses), but stretches him beyond a caricature by infusing him with a little bit of hurt and a little bit of anger. There is one scene where we get to see behind Gordo's mask and Edgerton could easily cop an Oscar nomination for it in a just and fair world.Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall also give incredible performances in what is essentially a three-person ensemble. The story is simple, but the execution is thrilling and the way the revelations unfold and keep us guessing about Gordo and Simon shows that this is actually a character driven film. Just as we peel away layers of Gordo, Bateman's Simon is also stripped away to be someone we didn't realise. But the beauty of Bateman's performance and Edgerton's writing/directing is that the clues are there in plain sight, and we find ourselves asking why did we ever think the way we did a minute ago? Not everything is resolved, and the film's pacing makes it feel a lot longer than it is - but the film's final 10 minutes was so insanely well done that I can forgive it those flaws.Edgerton's directorial style is incredible. The movie is so utterly tense - even when we know inside ourselves that it shouldn't be - and much kudos goes to Eduard Grau's cinematography (it always feels like the main characters are being watched), Luke Doolan's editing and the film's eerie score by Danny Bensi and Saunder Jurriaans. Edgerton rarely gives in to jump scares, but on the few occasions he does, they are supremely effective and not at all cheap.This is one of those films that you want a long drive home to dissect it, because the more you talk about it, the more you find to love. It grabbed me in an iron grip and did not let me go until the credits rolled. My heart raced the entire time.",The Gift
141,trublu215,"A mind blowing, twisted film that just solidified itself as one of the best films of the year.",10,8 August 2015,"""You may be done with the past but the past isn't done with you."", one of the many creepy and subtly sinister lines out of Joel Edgerton's brilliant directorial debut. The Gift is the definition of a sleeper hit. It has all the right things going for it, a great cast, a great script and the potential to be a future classic. What starts off as a slow burn thriller, giving the audience enough exposè to make us really connect with these characters and sympathize with every single one of them then slowly turns into a new age Pacific Heights. The film pits Simon and Robyn, two newlyweds that have just bought a house in Simon's hometown. While out shopping, Simon runs into Gordo, a guy from his high school days that is a bit off and at that moment, the film takes off and we're given enough twists and turns to constitute this as shocking to say the least. Actor and, now, director Joel Edgerton knocks this film out of the park, making this a home run for it being his directorial debut. Hell, if this was his tenth film, it'd be a home run. Edgerton directs his screenplay and actors with such confidence, you'd think Adrian Lynn directed it. The three leads in Jason Bateman, Rebecca Hall and Joel Edgerton couldn't be more perfect. Bateman delivers a career best performance, ditching his recent string of light comedies and applying his condescending attitude towards the yuppie entitlement in Simon. Rebecca Hall, who has yet to deliver a bad performance in my eyes, makes this no exception. She's fantastic in this film. Joel Edgerton also proves extremely eerie as Gordo and for someone to pull off the perfect trifecta such as Edgerton, it puts him in the same league as Ben Affleck. This is a fantastically twisted potboiler film that needs to be seen. The Gift stands as single handedly the best film of the summer and one of the very best of the year.",The Gift

144,talisencrw,Very good directing debut for actor Joel Edgerton--I hope he directs more often!,9,9 May 2016,"Being a) the shortest boy in my class in my early years; b) the smartest; and c) adopted by parents of mixed ethnicity (which was a rarity in my small city at that time, the mid 70's), I was a natural target for bullies. At every conceivable instance (and a lot of inconceivable ones as well!), I fought all comers, often coming home black-and-blue, and exhausted--I may have lost some matches to bigger and older boys, but if they were going to win, they were at least going to pay for it, and feel the after-effects for a while. (Thankfully this ended when I was talking with my friend, who was carrying home his personal baseball equipment, when I was approached. I asked if I could borrow his bat for a second, and that ended that. I wouldn't recommend that as a solution to others, for legal reasons. Thankfully the bully's mom and mine were friends, and when he ran home crying and told her what happened, she replied, 'If Billy did that to you, then you deserved it.') I don't often do so, but I watched the DVD extras before I watched the film (I usually wait until afterwards). Edgerton's impressive directorial debut here, as well as script, fulfilled (at least to my eyes) his purpose, that of making a psychological thriller along the level of his directing idols, Sir Alfred Hitchcock and David Fincher. The three main stars, Edgerton, Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall (I kept thinking she was Anne Hathaway!), did very good work here. I never really went for Bateman's work when he was younger, but a good friend often watched 'Arrested Development' when I was over, a few years back, and I have grown to like his acting, but he really hits it out of the park here. Had this not been an independent production but a more big-budget affair (i.e., David Fincher), I think he could have gotten an Oscar nomination--he's THAT good here.There was the occasional logical issue I had with the film afterwards, when I stopped and REALLY thought hard about it, but I have no problem with that kind of thing, if I enjoy everything else (which I did). Highly recommended. Definitely worth buying and rewatching--and I can't say that about most films made today. I hope that Edgerton doesn't give up acting, because he's definitely good at it, but I hope he also keeps on writing scripts and directing. Simply based on 'The Gift', he has an admirer in me for life.",The Gift
145,quaseprovisorio,"the film is good, i would've like a more intense build up and a bit of more solid directing.",7,9 May 2020,"First, the best things i found here: how the couple's dynamic evolves throughout the movie. i even would say that the whole film is pretty much about what she sees in him at the beggining and at the end: how that journey went. (don't think i'm spoiling not going to explain anything) how they behave as soon as gordo's intromissions became more frequent. the characters change...or at least they change their attitudes while the film is going. you can say there's a bunch of turns here (not exactly twists) that makes you more eager to know what's going on.the music and the light i also found cool. the actors are fine too, can't complain about none of them, and some of the ideas the film present are interesting: the human being is able to change: but do we all change that much? can we forgive and forget? can we learn from our mistakes, all of us? or it's just easier to put a rock under them and live with the perception everybody did the same thing and continue life? without making amends or reflecting about the happenings?now, while i was watching the movie i was enjoying it, but at the same time i was asking myself i wasn't i enjoying the hell out of it.i like thrillers i like to keep guessing, i think some of the characters are cool...what thappened for me that i wasn't loving this? well, first my perceptions: i thought this movie would be more claustrophobic and would have less characters. they even have a bunch but most of them don't have any depth. then i think it's the directing. i feel egerton is a not much experienced with directing and that is visible sometimes. i'm not saying it's bad, i'm saying some scenes could be a bit scarier, more claustrophobic... some of the options of the script mostly in the build up part could have been a bit different. i knew they wanted a slow burn but sometimes they could have gotten a little more intense.all in all is a pretty good thriller that's worth a watch. i don't think is that memorable or intense, but i understand why some people think it is. still i can't complain much. some stuff here was well done and is a pretty solid directing debut for edgerton.",The Gift
146,tfminfl,204. The Gift,9,9 March 2018,"It's like a really dark sequel to Arrested Development and you find out that Michael is really the most evil member of the Bluth family. Don't know what I mean, let me explain, well, this movie not Arrested Development, which is a great show, Ron Howard wanted me to spread the word. So we meet Simon and Robyn have just moved back to Simon's' hometown and are quickly recognized by Gordon, who seems very nice and pleasant and is nothing but kind to the couple. However Gordon and Simon are already acquainted from way back in the days of high school. And Gordon becomes overly attached and goes above and beyond making them comfortable, uncomfortable so. Unannounced visits, creepy gifts just left on the door step. So Simon finally says enough, get lost. Not before one last present with a note stating that he was sorry and wanted 'bygones to be bygones', and its that statement that gets Robyn saying, hmmm, is this not one sided. So she does a little digging and well, Simon may be a wicked douche, and everything that happens next may be a carefully planned out revenge of a bullied teenager, or it may not. Super creepy, written, directed by, and starring Joel Edgerton. Such a satisfying ending :) Good job Joel. Also starring Michael Bluth, oh I mean Jason Bateman, who I can see being a douche, he's good dont get me wrong, but theres a certain level of douche-baggery to him.

There are plot holes but there is rarely a film which does not have plot holes, in fact without them most films would struggle. People do illogical things in films, otherwise when your friend says ""lets visit the deserted lunatic asylum on Halloween"" you would say ""no I think I will sit here drinking beer and eating popcorn"" while watching the X factor.

150,robsta23,Joel Edgerton's Anti-Bullying Commercial,5,26 August 2015,"I am really stunned that a majority of critics are saying good things about this film. That doesn't necessarily mean that the film is automatically great, but it is giving The Gift a lot more attention than it deserves. Looking at the trailer for this film I had low expectations and The Gift pretty much turned out how I expected it to be.Joel Edgerton must have had a bad experience with bullying at one point in his life, because his triple-helm as writer, director and star of this film seems like a pathetic attempt to show dire consequences that will come from bullying or destroying people's lives through lies.Early in the film, Simon (Jason Bateman) encounters Gordo (Edgerton) at a mall, and Gordo makes the effort to reconnect with Simon in a few different ways, though Gordo actually usually runs into Simon's wife (Rebecca Hall) at their house while Simon is at work. Shortly after these encounters, Simon's character is written very poorly, and he describes Gordo like a little kid would describe an outcast - ""he was Gordo the weirdo,"" he uses a really awkward voice to mock Gordo, and he even creeps his wife out in the strangest way - but all of these behaviors seem more fitting for a middle school student than the adult character of Simon. Later in the film we find out that Simon had bullied Gordo at one point, so these behaviors now seem fitting, but they are still childlike.Another thing is that this film is supposed to feel like a legitimate thriller, but the only time Gordo's character is really intimidating is towards the conclusion of the film. Gordo takes this rivalry to a whole new level at the climax of the film, which is one of the few things in this film that holds any merit. All I will say about the climax of the film is that I wasn't expecting it at all, and if it weren't for such a creepy twist I would have thought this movie was straight up terrible.I already said Simon's character was written poorly, but I think the casting choice was even poorer since I couldn't take Jason Bateman seriously as a previous bully. It turns out his character has in the past and continues to lie about people who stand in his way to get rid of them, and with a character like that Bateman did not bring a sinister performance he needed to get the point across. It is also unexplained how his lies are just accepted by people, but Karma catches up with him about his lies shortly before the film's climax.It's funny, I usually find the ending of a film to be the most critical part of each movie I watch, meaning if the film has a great ending I consider it great, and the opposite if the film has a terrible ending. This is a film I don't care much for, but it has a really good ending.2.0/4.0",The Gift

While it's impossible to know what it will be like, you still know that there will be one. And that's exactly the problem with this movie. You just go through it feeling like a mind reader who is able to guess may of the scenes before they happen: the guy will turn up here, and he does; the dog is going to disappear and he does.; the husband has a secret and he does. There were just too many things that were easy to guess to feel blown away with this movie. Surprisingly enough, I have to admit that I had a decent time watching it, and do you know why?

152,ctowyi,A Psychological Thriller That Pulsates With a New Beat,8,13 August 2015,"I saw the trailer for The Gift a few weeks ago and wasn't too excited about it. Movies which I can surmise the plot straightaway from watching the trailer don't entice me at all. But great word of mouth and some exceptional reviews changed my mind, and I am so glad I caught this before the run is over. This is easily one of the best psychological thrillers I have seen this year.There is a lot to admire in The Gift but its chief virtues are its refusal to align with any character and its unpredictability in terms of its plot. Joel Edgerton wrote, acted and directed this thriller and it is a superb piece of smart writing. He knows his audience well enough to know where our minds will take us and what we will expect to see, then he subverts the expectations and zigzags us into the dark recesses of the human heart.It may sound easy to pigeonhole this one as ""your past will come back and bite you"" revenge thriller, but the script does a solid job in deconstructing the current state of climbing the social-corporate ladder and what a sound marriage entails. In short, this one has levels. I also love how Edgerton shifts gears in such a subtle manner that I never saw how it morphs from social commentary to horror to an investigative procedural and finally surges towards an exuberant mindfcuk finale.Most movies nowadays sleepwalk through the usual paces but not this one. You will never be able to guess where this one is heading based on what you see in the beginning.

156,stephendaxter,An edge of seat experience that i recommend you watch,7,27 August 2015,"'The Gift' is a mystery thriller starring Jason Bateman, Rebecca Hall and is the directorial debut for Joel Edgerton who also starred in the film. The film had a very creepy and suspenseful tone for most of the movie that has you on the edge of your seat. I will say right out of the gate that if you fall asleep easily and aren't into slower films this is probably something you might not last through, because to create that suspense the film is a very slow burn for pretty much the entire film. For the first hour of the film i was completely engaged and the creepy tone had my full attention, the film had me trying to guess what would happen next only to prove me wrong on most occasions. It was a great unpredictable ride right until that one hour mark where it almost looks like someone else took the reigns and steered the film in another direction. For the whole second act it ditches the the suspense for 30 minutes of strict character development with some development of the main plot that answers a question that could have been answered in like 5- 10 minutes with the same resulting effects. This imbalance really damaged the film and the sudden switch in tone felt more like a lifetime drama with a hint of mystery than a straight up mystery thriller. The film does manage to revert back to the creepy and unsettling mysterious tones in what resulted in an incredible final 15 minutes that had me in awe. The first hour of the film in combination with the fantastic finale shows that Joel Edgerton can do a really good job at creating a film with good tone, characters and plot that work really well together, but that drop off in the second act shows that he still has a little more to learn in the art of directing. Lets now move on to the cast and their performances, to me, i thought the whole cast were pretty great and it was a relatively small cast with only Jason Bateman, Joel Edgerton, and Rebecca Hall playing characters you will remember. They all did a great job at playing their characters and they didn't feel cliché and acted very natural and how you would think some people would react in these situations. Joel Edgerton proved his acting skills again as he nailed that fine line between creepy and generous that had me second guessing myself an many many moments. I was particularly curious to see if Jason Bateman could take on this very serious role and execute it well, as we are used to seeing him in more strictly comedic roles. And now i have to believe that he will be getting more of these roles in the future because of this very convincing performance playing a character who gets more and more interesting as the film goes on, and just as the character got more interesting Jason was getting better and better. In the end, this indie mystery thriller is a good example why indie films are becoming some of the best films to release this year and can really go up against the big blockbusters. - 7.5",The Gift
157,ilovesaturdays,The giving that causes misgivings!,9,28 June 2020,"There is an old adage implying that it's not gift that matters but the spirit in which it is bestowed. In this movie, many gifts were given from time to time by an old friend to his mate and his wife. Each time the new gift is more mysterious than the previous one. The gift, per se, is always something that the receivers appreciate but slowly they begin to wonder about the spirit in which the gifts are being given.In a sense it is a true psychological thriller because you see nothing sinister or horrible happening on the screen and yet you feel a strong psychological undercurrent of misgiving. The director, Mr. Edgerton, has not resorted to cheap tactics and gory scenes, and yet the film manages to make quite an impact. The script is so good that it hardly needs any artificial embellishments. This is exactly the kind of psychological thrillers that I find very interesting.'The Gift' is beautifully shot and excellently paced. Most of the suspense plays in the mind of the viewer, thus making it an excellent psychological thriller. If you like this particular genre, then give this one a shot. I'm sure you'll find it vastly superior to many that have come before or after.",The Gift
158,DimitrisPassas-TapTheLine,"Not the usual, generic crime/thriller movie.",8,14 March 2019,"This movie was a pleasant and much appreciated surprise, a film that stands out from the majority of the American -crime/thriller- genre productions that we watched in the last few years. ''The Gift'' is a low-key, low-budget film which relies on its great plot and characterization rather than the use of special effects. It is a suspenseful story which begins when the married couple of Simon and Robyn decides to move from Chicago into Simon's hometown in order to make a fresh start, attempting to flee from the -many- problems they had in the previous few years. The exact nature of these problems are gradually revealed to the viewer and we learn the whole truth in a slow, though suspenseful, way. As the couple is shopping for their new home, Simon runs into an old classmate of his, Gordo, whose behavior seems to be a little off at the beginning, and it quickly deteriorates to stalking and criminal actions against the couple.
The riddle that lies on the center of the film's plot is the reason behind Gordo's increasingly bizarre behavior. Robyn will quickly suspect that Simon is not telling her the truth about his past misdeeds and sets off to find out the truth herself. She finally realizes that the person she trusts the most, her husband, is not who she thought he was and this fact aggravates her mental issues, that she successfully dealt in the past, leading to paranoia and total lack of trust in Simon.
What makes ''The Gift'' a different, as well as a highly recommended, thriller is its great finale that leaves the audience hanging but at the same time is the most appropriate ending in this disturbing story of bullying, lies and violence. The movie offers catharsis to the audience in an innovative and ingenious manner, making the ''Gift'', a picture which will remain to the viewer's memory for a long time. I am not a big fan of Jason Bateman but I have to admit that he is decent in his portrayal of Simon and Rebecca Hall is excellent as Robyn. Joel Edgerton, who is also the writer and the director of the film, is convincing in the difficult role of odd Gordo and I hope that we will have the chance to watch him in future productions.
To sum up, ''The Gift'' is a movie that guarantees entertainment and should not be missed by any true fan of the genre.",The Gift
159,skullhead739,Why all the positive reviews?,3,25 November 2020,"Therw is so much wrong with this film i dont know where to start. And Trust me there's a lot which mind boggles me even more why this is a 7.1/10 currently..The wife is horrible and the acting is mediocre. The introduction along with the dialog is plain. ""Gordo's"" acting was great as well as ""Simon's"" as always. The suspense and soundtrack is really good and thats about all the good. Now with the bad. The viewer is made to believe gordo is bad then as the film goes on you feel bad for him and Simon is made to be bad and then the director flips the viewer off and make both Gordy and simon bad with a hilariously bad ending.. I mean this has got to be one of the poorest, horribly unintelligent endings I've ever seen. Without spoiling anything Gordy would easily be convicted because of dna and video proof and the only good/innocent character in this is the one that has had panic attacks and is possibly raped? Totally messed up and a waste of a possibly good film idea.I wouldn't reccomend this as a watch as its too poorly executed, plot holes everywhere and builds up to let you down. 3/10.",The Gift
160,Nightmarelogic,Can bygones ever really be bygones?,9,11 February 2016,"""You see what happens when you poison other peoples minds with ideas."" The story itself is a simple one. A young married couple move from Chicago to LA and run into someone the husband went to high school with. The man begins to leave gifts at the couples home and the wife believes he is stalking them but the husband keeps assuring her that nothing is wrong and he took care of it. However the more she learns of the man and her husband's past the more she realizes she doesn't know the man she married. The story itself is about how the past effects the present. It is about bullying and the effects it has on both the bully and the bullied. The movie is slow and very dark but then most good thrillers are. They take time to set up the pieces but once they do they knock them down.

When you have a snake in the chicken coup you have to convince not just the characters whose lives are being infiltrated (WATCH THE KING FOR A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THIS) but also the audience needs to feel conflicted and unsure. At that first dinner party, the way he kept on saying over and over how happy he was for them, his whole presentation etc was very poor as a what if t his guy is a whacko proposition because he SO OBVIOUSLY WAS.. This just made me wanna walk away from Gordo and the couple immediately, as it was just super super predictable from that moment. NO TENSION AT ALL. So im giving this a low score despite Rebecca Hall's beautiful mouth. And liking Edgerton and Bateman heaps. more subtlety less sledgehammer would have made it so much better.",The Gift
162,Condemned-Soul,A deliberately paced mystery thriller that unveils a flesh-crawling finale,9,17 August 2017,"Writer/director Joel Edgerton's The Gift is about a happily married couple trying for a baby, whose lives are turned upside down when an acquaintance from the past shows up at their new home, presenting gifts and accompanied with a threatening agenda. You can't gauge where it goes from there because of the unpredictability of the smart script. The trailer was deliberately average, giving away nothing so as to lower your expectations before heading in, only to unabashedly shatter that miscalculation with a sledgehammer; it hits you hard and then leaves a lingering sting, an acrid touch you can't shake off.It's a slow film that takes careful time to evolve across its run-time, a genre entry that's wicked and subversive and disturbing, ultimately proving to be worth the wait. (Though nothing can prepare you for what will eventually be revealed). Patient viewers will be responsive to the series of subtle thrills that lead up to its truly flesh-crawling final scenes – an ending that'll leave you suitably unsettled – and a well-placed score contributes immensely to where and when you should feel uncomfortable before the big payoff. The mystery thriller also contains a range of strong performances; from Joel Edgerton's creepy, misunderstood antagonist; to Jason Bateman's slyly corrupted protagonist harbouring long-buried secrets; and finally the unknowing victim of the whole ordeal, Rebecca Hall, playing Bateman's sympathetic wife - every actor garners attention for their nuanced work in this critically acclaimed, underseen hit.The Gift registers a couple of effective jump scares whilst it works at getting under your skin, and that application here is through skillful work of creating an atmosphere thick with tension and hostility to embed its narrative within. Without that considerate build-up of suspense, the jump moment's hold no purpose, making you eye roll at another ineffective use of sometimes cheap tricks or scare tactics to illicit reactions in viewers. Joel Edgerton solves that simple, missable opportunity with an excellently taut atmosphere. (Something most horror films cannot do).The seeds are planted early for what will inevitably happen, growing insidiously before transforming into something utterly diabolical, delivering a deliciously nasty finale; a fate so ambiguous it's haunting. Everything collapses in on our protagonist at the end, someone we liked at the beginning (but had no reason to), and then feel nothing for him by the conclusion (by this point we have motive to). The moral of the story is simple – everything has consequences, and the past will find you, judge you and, if need be, provide deliverance or comeuppance. In Joel Edgerton's chilling directorial debut, the latter is rightfully earned; the ultimate revenge.9/10",The Gift
163,freshclean-66-318608,This Is Truly A Gift!,7,12 September 2016,"""The Gift"" is a gift! This not so big film was brilliant and riveting from its rise at the beginning, to its climatic and dramatically surprising end. Joel Edgerton did a wonderful job directing, writing, and starring in this film as Gordo. This film was totally slept on by the major film ""critics"". If it wasn't for me just browsing through my Redbox app I would probably have never known about this gift, pardon the pun. I don't see how major film critics passed this one up. The story-line and the plot were set up perfectly and the cast was phenomenal. Jason Bateman, a brilliant actor who I think is kind of slept on too, played an arrogant jerk perfectly as Simon and Joel Edgerton, who I mentioned earlier doing a great job writing and directing this film, also did a wonderful job starring in this film as Gordo and Rebecca Hall was perfect for the caring and concerned Robyn. The way this mystery/thriller unfolded was great. I would definitely see it again with my wife or someone who hasn't seen it yet. If you're wondering if you should or should not see this film just because there was no major press on it take my advice and see it.",The Gift
164,palavitsinis,Didn't see that coming! Me like!,8,26 October 2015,"Judging from the ""cover"", this movie seemed really standard. A mainstream thriller that had nothing special to offer. But its IMDb rating was too high for something like that so we ended up watching it. Through the first minutes of the movie, it seemed pretty straightforward. The couple moving to the new town, weird guy, etc. But even like that, the movie somehow kept me at the edge of my seat!And soon, when things got a bit more complicated, and the characters of the people as well as the secrets of the past started to unveil, it was amazing! I loved the ending, although I am one of these guys that need a bit more ""explicit"" closure. Overall, great acting, nicely done and a real thriller! Thought that 7 was too low, so I gave an eight but it's actually a 7,5. Really liked Joel Edgerton whom I saw also in Black Mass. I did not expect Jason Bateman to be as good cause it's more of a comedian for me, but he was pretty pretty good!",The Gift

166,lucasversantvoort,Impressive debut from Edgerton who relies more on slow build-ups than jumpscares,6,18 November 2015,"Joel Edgerton has been an actor for quite some time now, but it's with The Gift, his directorial debut, and his portrayal of a corrupt FBI agent in Black Mass that he seems to have 'burst onto the scene' as they call it. The Gift is his attempt at a psychological thriller. The film features a nice and slow build-up which is to be commended, but the final act isn't worthy of it.Simon (Jason Bateman) and Robyn (Rebecca Hall) have recently moved to L.A. as Simon recently got a new job there. One day when they're out shopping, a rather shabby looking man named Gordo (Joel Edgerton) approaches Simon, claiming to recognize him from high school. Eventually, Simon recognizes him too and he and Robyn have him over for dinner. Usually, this would end with both parties saying they're looking forward to the next time they'll meet, even though they both know they're not interested. But Gordo keeps showing up at their doorstep and doesn't seem willing to stay out of their lives. This kicks off a series of events where, to use that familiar phrase, not everyone's who they seem to be.The Gift is part thriller, part horror and so there's a tendency to fall into the trap of saturating your film with jumpscares. Besides a jumpscare or two, the film's mostly about building suspense and generating a feeling of paranoia, something that requires a bit more directorial know-how.Edgerton succeeds in unsettling us with themes of social anxiety and paranoia, but the final act--though featuring a deliciously evil and ambiguous twist--lays things on a little thick in comparison to the subtlety of what came before. Edgerton's also a little too obvious with his sprinkling of clues in the first act. Early on, Simon's fear of monkeys is mentioned and during dinner, Gordo makes a passing remark on how governments listen in on its citizens' conversations. How much do you want to bet wiretapping and monkeys will be part of plot twists later on? One other thing: the jumpscares. They are so few in number, I honestly feel The Gift would've been better had they been left out. Edgerton spends all this time and effort in subtly unsettling us with Gordo as the unwelcome guest. To then revert to cheap jumpscares to jumpstart your film is disappointing.Nevertheless, it's a pretty well set-up thriller. I'm always pleased to see thrillers that are a cut above the usual jumpscare-heavy fare. Had the final act been more subtle and human, The Gift could've been something special. As it is, it's just a good thriller.",The Gift
167,MUFCOK,"Labelled a Psychological Thriller rather than a Horror, I was expecting an intelligently created, suspenseful story. Sadly, I was left slightly disappointed.",6,25 February 2016,"I find Psychological Thrillers more chilling as they are real. Ghosts and Monsters may offer jump scares and can make decent horror movies but they don't leave a lasting impression on me as they are so far from realism it takes away much of the fear. A psychological thriller, based around human emotions and characteristics can provide us with a much deeper fear, if done correctly. The Gift is a story of a newly married couple Simon (Jason Bateman) and Robyn (Rebecca Hall) who have moved into a new area, they have their dream, forever house and are very content with their lives. Out shopping for furniture one morning, they bump into one of Simon's old school friends, Gordo (Joel Edgerton). Gordo appears very strange, socially awkward and he certainly leaves an impression on Simon. Over the coming days, Gordo keeps turning up at the house uninvited and regularly leaves gifts on the couple's door steps. Joel Edgerton as well as acting in this movie, also wrote and directed it. I will give him serious praise for his direction especially, as The Gift looked visually stunning. The house which was chose for the filming set was a perfect choice, floor to ceiling windows, in a secluded environment were wonderful for a stalker type movie. It really gave the impression that there was nowhere to hide and that he could be watching from anywhere, into any room. The choice of music which he uses to complement the film is another strong factor, he creates suspense well and the more disturbing scenes are edited perfectly. On direction and cinematography alone I was very impressed, sadly this wasn't enough as I felt the movie lacked elsewhere.Jason Bateman, better known for his comedy roles, did a reasonably acceptable job in this movie, he wasn't anything to shout about but he did make the role his own quite well and was quite believable. Rebecca Hall didn't give an amazing performance in my opinion, she was quite underwhelming if I'm honest. She was supposed to be the person you were supposed to really like but as her character was so annoying and made ridiculous choices consistently, she really wasn't that relatable. However, it was refreshing however to see a 'strong wife' role as appose to the usual emotional wreck, screaming female role we are forced to watch in so many of these movies. Joel Edgerton gave a strong performance, easily the best of the lot. His character was uncomfortable and edgy without being over the top. He was subtle, which I found quite freaky as it was much more realistic. The supporting cast are few and far between and the little screen time they did get wasn't anything special.The Gift is a slow burner, it progresses at a very leisurely pace, building suspense and mystery very well as the story unfolds. It is very much a thriller, not a horror, although there are a couple of cliché jump scares which were passable as they weren't overdone and did feel quite relevant to their situations. The Gift is a story of Winners and Losers, with strong emphasis on people's belief that the winners keep on winning while the losers deserve to keep on losing. My main problem with The Gift is that the more the story unravels the less you seem to care about the characters, they all seem so hollow and I didn't find myself cheering any of them on. As things started to come together I was impressed with certain aspects of the movie but ultimately felt a little flat. I was expecting a lot from the film, it had a big hype with some very good reviews and it's a genre that I usually enjoy.The overall end message is striking, with the climax of the movie coming together quite well. The story definitely goes full circle with an ending that should give great satisfaction to the viewer; sadly for me I found it to be a little underwhelming.6/10",The Gift

170,just_in_case,For better or worse not what the trailers sell you,8,1 November 2015,"It's unfortunate, but still correct that the trailers aren't giving you the whole story. This is probably going to start a trend of ""well Joel Edgerton worked on it so it must be good."". I know after seeing I'm gonna be on that mindset. To be honest when you watch the trailers its looks awful. Just some generic stalker movie with nothing setting it apart. I'll update this when I think of one but there's several true horror Stalker films that have a little extra to get you through it. In the trailers at least this one didn't. Then I read that Joel Edgerton wrote it. Admittedly after seeing ""Warrior"" to me anything Joel is involved in deserved an open mind now. Also if you watch closely to one specific trailer it lets on that this isn't as clean cut Good vs Evil as you might think. Without spoiling anything the best way to describe this film is to say, weirdly, you are getting to see performance of Jason Batemans career. This is the deepest most multi- colored role he will likely ever play and god he does it so well I found myself cringing at some of his character turns. There's nothing stilted here. It's a kaleidoscope of character progression from Bateman and the two other leads are kind of like a foil. Trust me you can read other stuff I post on here I do not wax poetic and get all metaphoric. This is the only way to describe what happens. So why did this film not get a 10/10? I think it's mostly Rebecca Hall's character whom is at fault. Her acting is great and Jesus do they make her pretty in this. They film her in such way that she absorbs every scene she's in. The problem is the character has some cracks in it that compared to everything else in the film, leaves you feeling like they cut back on her arc a bit. Its kind of like a 500 piece puzzle missing just a few pieces. Its pretty but its difficult not to keeps staring at the holes. Great film, do not miss out 8/10",The Gift

173,Brevin_Campbell,This movie is a Gift,9,28 December 2015,"You know those stories about she obsessions or the creepy guy who is stalks you all over the place wanting you dead. Haven't you got sick of those cause I know I have, so when I heard about another movie about a guy stalking around like a creep wanting to terrorize his friend from the past I rolled my eyes at the thought. I mean seriously haven't we had enough of this. We know how it ends. The obsessive dude loses. We have seen it again and again. But this movie changes the game completely. This movie is not just about some guy with a obsession or some knack for revenge. Rather this is a story of a kind hearted male who was wronged, and simply wants his due. You find yourself on his side and wanting to understand him more than anything else. This is undoubtedly Blumhouse's best work, and they deserve all the praise in the world for this story. The acting is very well done as well. I won't say it is at Oscar level, but still very good acting from all the cast involved. Jason Bateman and Joel Egerton defiantly carry this film on there backs. They draw you in and make you care so much about what is going on with each of them. Hell even when there saying very few words it carries so much weight with it you find yourself forgetting a lot, and instead just getting drawn in. Rebecca Hall is also great in this film giving probably the best performance in the movie. She made the whole thing feel so much more like a horror film even when she has no lines you can tell she is feeling a lot of pain and because of that the film really does work in a lot more ways than one.Overall this is a great film and will probably be in my top 5 favorite films of the year",The Gift

However i don't think they should have cast Rebecca Hall, not only did i find her plain to look at but she just came across as the typical suffering wife, she hardly smiles throughout the film.

Edgerton also plays one of three main characters, Gordo, in the film, and he wrote the script. He succeeds in all three jobs. Congratulations, director!'The Gift' has many false turns and a lot of misdirection. Where 'Gone Girl' is a poorly acted, predictable marriage thriller, 'The Gift' is clever and extremely well performed. Part of the thanks goes the casting of Jason Bateman as the husband. Here, Bateman demonstrates that he is more than just a comedic actor and more than up to the complicated role. Rebecca Hall underplays her dramatic role with expertise. And Edgerton's Gordo is a potent presence even when the character is off the screen. 'The Gift' builds its drama deliberately, not wasting motion while not rushing. And the payoff is tense, entertaining and cathartic. The Gift is not your typical stranger/stalker film, your spouse gone bad film, nor your typical mystery. Are you listening Hollywood? It can be done! I can't emphasize this more: the trick is in the writing. Rating: Pay Full PriceThe film scares us in a way that modern horror films don't, for it's real and tense.

At 1:48 minutes, ""The Gift"" is a bit overlong, with two or three sections that don't seem to go anywhere— but the rest of the movie (including the final act) has terrific momentum that helps balance everything out.Something about the movie-- maybe its tone, or style, or suburban setting-- makes me think of mystery thrillers from the early 2000s, like ""Murder by Numbers"" or ""Along Came a Spider."" It's a quiet movie featuring wealthy people speaking quietly, in fear of stirring up demons from their pasts or thoughts in their heads. Its stylistic and subdued, with slowly mounting tension with a payoff that doesn't leave you feeling frustrated.In the end, I wound up liking this movie more than I thought I would, thanks to it's twisted storyline and its three well-fleshed out characters.

I really found myself lost not in the plot of the film (similar stories have been done), but I was completely taken in by the transitions in characters, and how we perceive people in a superficial manner.""The Gift"" has a very simple plot, but it does itself a huge favor by not trying to assume to much. Two high school acquaintances run into each other years after, and each have their separate lives. One successful, one perhaps not. The relevance of this chance meeting changes both of their lives in such profound ways, that by the end of the movie, my empathy had completely changed. It's simple story cuts out the shock violence, ridiculous plots, and confusing story lines, all for the better.The real gift of this film is watching Jason Bateman and Joel Edgerton transition from beginning to the end. Both roles in this film are some of my favorite dramatic pieces I've seen. Bateman plays a loving husband, devoted career man, smart and witty all at the same time. It's easy to with a man who cares so much for his wife. Joel Edgerton on the other-hand we see as a mysterious loner, who perhaps is too awkward and too overbearing in a friendship that doesn't exist to begin with. As the film progresses, you feel a subtle shift in your empathy with each individual. Anyone who has ever been bullied, or perhaps have been a bully, begins immediately to shift perspectives with both characters. Rebecca Hall is a great lead as Bateman's wife, and she succeeds very well at showing her shifting allegiances between the two men.The emotions and ideas behind this film are simple ones indeed. But in an age where most directors try to pull you in with hyper-violence and inane plot twists, it's great when there are those directors who are learning to master the difference between mystery and intrigue. This is an excellent story.7/10",The Gift
182,TheCasualReviewer,An incredible feature film debut,6,23 March 2020,"SYNOPSIS:
Simon (Jason Bateman) runs into an old classmate, Gordo (Joel Edgerton), when moving back to California for work. At first, Simon and Robyn (Rebecca Hall) think he's just a little off, until it seems he might be tearing their relationship apart.REVIEW:
Bravo Mr. Edgerton. Out of the couple feature films Joel Edgerton has directed, this is definitely the one to watch. This is the epitome of psychological thriller and the delivery is amazing. The acting from Bateman, Hall and Edgerton are amongst the best of all of their filmography. It's a slow burn with great dialogue that allows the plot to build and build without you even realizing how slow of a burn it is. You become encapsulated in the downfall of Simon and Robyn. Knowing as a viewer just how much Gordo has to do with it, while the characters themselves live oblivious. You're waiting and waiting for Gordo to make a move that's over the top, but don't know if it's just the psychological warfare or if Gordo is just the catalyst to a failing marriage. The twist at the end is incredible and just enough to keep the audience thinking beyond the runtime of the film. Available on Netflix as if when I'm posting this so, please, if you haven't seen this film already, do yourself a favor and watch it. 8.8/10.",The Gift

I just didn't see anything particularly special about it. I certainly didn't say wow at the end of it and didn't expect to see fairly regular praise on IMDb.The basic plot of one individual embedding themselves in another person life is not new. I did like how Simon ended up being just as screwed up as Gordo. Clearly Simon was an older version of his bully self from High School as you can see with how he handled his competition for the promotion.It was interesting enough to keep my attention, but it lacked the intensity that other movies like this have. I started becoming more ""afraid"" of Simon than Gordo. Intentional? Maybe. I don't quite understand if Gordo ran into Simon that day by chance or if it was calculated. Either way, the extent he went to get back at Simon was a little over the top. Did he or did he not rape Robyn? Even if he didn't he was invading their privacy and was touching her while she was passed out even if he didn't rape her.I guess in the end having Simon revealed for who he was a bully and psychologically making him wonder if Robyn gave birth to his son or to Gordon's, did get Gordo's revenge.So, yes. It was not too shabby. I just do not think it was that great. It lacked the thrill and intensity that other films like this have.",The Gift

Its how subtle it is you don't hear that violin high note every time the stalker is watching from a distance or a shadow figure move very fast in a hall way,using new directions making it a very realistic environment.This movie to me is what a real psychological thriller is all about everything is in the ambiguity of the situation,the uncanny. How some motives can be misinterpret by the the characters and suddenly everything becomes strange giving them insecurity.(MINOR SPOILERS)My main question is who is really the victim, as we go along we discover that Simon has a dark past with Gordo,he feels disturbed by Gordo and fears that he is obsessed with his wife he seeks him and intimidates Gordo to stop him from harassing both him and his wife,we realize Simon hides who he really is and Gordo takes out the side in him. He is a complete boor,and gradually he takes out that side with his wife and his job. Gordo is an odd individual to which one can question his social behavior, his revenge at the end removes any credibility as innocent. Both are monsters in their right, they not deserve to be treated differently. I do not feel bad about either of them,theirs no proof that both of them have genuine intentions to be justify in any way.This film is highly recommended,everything in the film is worth the time.",The Gift
185,alanhowden-86367,A very good film that I found very uncomfortable to watch,6,2 March 2021,"The movie was really well plotted, paced and acted. It was very weird to see Jason Bateman, who is usually so likeable, play such an awful person so convincingly.
The problem (for me) is, it was such a successfully unsettling, intentionally unpleasant thriller, where nothing good happens for anyone, that I didn't really enjoy watching it at all.",The Gift
186,Oberrated,Edge of your seat thriller/mystery,7,21 April 2016,"The Gift, if you could not already gather the concept, was wildly entertaining to me. It began ordinary, as if nothing could go wrong and as soon as Gordo was introduced, things went haywire. I was sitting on the edge of my seat in anticipation of what would happen next in this film as the psychological thriller aspect of this movie is so very well done, and without spoilers, everything that would be common and expected in a typical movie is spun completely different in this one. The final motives of why the events of this film go down leaves some audiences stunned, it sure left me stunned, and the overall finale of this film had me impressed enough to be praising this film. I try my best to give you guys open and honest opinions on films and I know this movie has been hit and miss for some audiences but if you want an impressive mental thriller, this movie is a key one for the year.",The Gift
187,movieliker1,I think this movie is good.,8,30 January 2021,"I thought it was good. I was pleasantly surprised to NOT see Jason Bateman in his usual role of ""the emasculated male"". I thought the acting was great.Yes, at first, I probably had the same reaction many viewers had - ""new couple moves into a new house, meets a weird stranger, he comes around too often, strange things start to happen."" We've all seen this before. But then it took interesting turns I found intriguing.Jason Bateman, Rebecca Hall and Joel Edgerton are terrific. I rolled my eyes a little in the beginning. But then I was entertained all the way through to the end.SPOILERS;I don't agree with the negative reviews. They mostly say if you've ever seen a show like 48 Hours, Dateline, 20/20, or CSI --- the ending doesn't work. I disagree. I watch those shows and it does work.Gordo tells Simon in the end, ""I never touched her. But we'll never know."" What about a DNA test? A DNA test only tells who the father is. Not if Gordo raped Robyn. Matter of fact, it works better if it is Simon's kid. He has a son he'll never raise.""What about the key, audio disc and video disc?"" That doesn't prove anything other than Gordo is a stalker. Doesn't prove he ever entered the house uninvited. Doesn't prove he drugged and raped Robyn. Doesn't even prove he took their dog.Being guilty of stalking is a small price to pay for ruining a man's life. He essentially destroyed Simon's career and marriage.Last but not least, people ask, ""What was the point of the movie?"" I think it's pretty obvious, ""Don't be a bully. What goes around, comes around.""I thought it was good.",The Gift

This is the first story I know about the ""aftermath"" of bullying, while almost any movie or novel about bullying shows kids bullying other kids.
I'd like to remark that it's still doable a movie which deals with horrible topics without showing almost anything actually horrible or violent or bloody. I mean that this is a movie in a Hitchcock-style. And I liked it.",The Gift
190,RileyOnFilm,When a Gift is Not a Gift,7,26 December 2016,"The gift isn't much of a gift at all. The gift to me was when I discovered Joel Edgerton is not only Gordo, the creepy stalker in the film, but also the writer/director of the piece. Wow! He certainly does a great job. Most directors might gravitate toward a role in their film that is endearing to the audience, Gordo couldn't be any further from that sort of character. Things that go bump in the night can usually be explained away. If you were in Simon and Robyn's case, you might find out your explanations are incorrect months or years later. So what were those creepy bumps for Simon and Robyn? Edgerton's script shows they are part of a larger, much darker, horrific beyond an R rated gift. You'll be surprised at the twist.Robyn and Simon have just moved in to a posh 60's retro home and are settling in as a married couple. They receive numerous visits from Gordo who says he knew Simon in High School. We get the feeling their relationship was more ominous in nature than it appears to Robyn, who Gordo starts to form a platonic relationship with. Through a course of events, the film becomes a typical stalker thriller but eventually sets itself apart as a very clever, well written, and telling ""human nature"" account of who everybody ""really"" is (not just Gordo).I really liked ""The Gift"" because I enjoy psychology. As the tale unravels we actually see perspectives we aren't meant to see. The obvious hero is far from it and the villain, while never a hero, becomes someone we can empathize with, though never fully. I thought the cast was amazing and the story really stays with you because of their performances. Jason Bateman does a great job in this thriller whereas he usually plays comedy parts. He can do a variety of roles. It's a perfect thriller but I thought it did take too long developing the story. I think it's over 2/3 of the way through before the typical stalker thriller stuff ends and you get into the genius of the film. For that reason it lost a star with me. Watch this creepy fun movie, I recommend it.",The Gift
191,keithlovesmovies,The Gift Review,9,23 September 2015,"When married couple Simon (Jason Bateman) and Robyn (Rebecca Hall) run into Gordo (Joel Edgerton), a former schoolmate of Simon's, their seemingly perfect lives take an unexpected turn for the worst. Simon initially claims to have not recognized Gordo but when he and his wife start to receive mysterious gifts and uninvited visits, a disturbing secret surfaces. As Robyn begins to learn the past history between Simon and Gordo, shew begins to question whether or not she ever really knew her husband at all.I will admit that I went into this film expecting it to be cheesy and predictable but I was pleasantly surprised when I found that it wasn't either of those. What may seem like a simple plot at first is done in an interesting and original way with many red herrings, plot twists, and shifting perspectives to keep us viewers engaged. The script written by Edgerton is well done in that it strays from the predictable and his characters drive the plot forward. Suspense is generated from the moral ambiguity of the characters as you never really know what their intentions are. The film. also directed by Edgerton, is beautifully shot in that the camera cuts in and out at the right time during the scary/suspenseful parts which adds to the experience. What also added to that experience was the soundtrack which always seemed to ratchet up and down at the right time letting you know when something was about to happen. Its amazing how it was able to achieve this without any blood or brutal violence. This was appreciated as I have seen a lot of those types of movies without ever eliciting too much of a reaction from me but there were a few moments when this one got to me which I enjoyed. I personally prefer psychological scares more than the more gruesome ones. The story can get a little slow at times but I didn't mind because of the performances of the three leads. I was surprised by Jason Bateman's Simon. Being used to his numerous comedic performances, I didn't think that he could do it. He was able to go from a normal man with a dry sense of humor to a sly, conniving bully on a dime. Rebecca Hall was great as Robyn, a damaged, vulnerable housewife simply looking for peace of mind. However Edgerton's Gordo is the highlight of this film. In his performance, he goes from nice and kind to creepy and unstable so effortlessly using mostly facial expressions. This film is a slow journey but the scenery is not like most and unlike a lot of thrillers, it doesn't play all of its cards too early and keeps the suspense all the way until the end which I will not spoil.Score: 9/10 keithlovesmovies.com",The Gift
192,byrann_gowan,The sins of the past,8,30 August 2018,"In this movie, married couple Simon and Robyn (played by Golden Globe Winner Jason Bateman and Golden Globe Nominee Rebecca Hall) are happy and healthy, until an old acquaintance from his past named Gordo (played by Golden Globe Nominee and director of the film Joel Edgerton). Gordo seems nice at first, but when Simon is suspicious of his motives, things get twisted really fast and past secrets are revealed. Simon and Robyn have to decide: is the past in the past or are some sins too unforgivable for forgiveness?You should really go and watch the film! It is a beautiful thriller that has an awesome twist for an ending, but I won't spoil it! First off, I gotta give props to Jason Bateman; known mostly for his comedic roles, he decides to switch it up here for dramatic effect and it works! Hopefully he does more dramatic work alongside his comedic roles. Rebecca Hall is also great too as the woman who questions everything she thought she knew about the one person closest to her.But let's face it, if anybody deserves the applause the most, it's Edgerton. As I stated before, not only does he play Gordo, but he is also director and writer for this film. Is this really his first film behind the camera? Because if it is, then it's a strong start for him! Sometimes when a director plays a main character on screen, it can come off as vain, but not here. Edgerton wisely chose another male to take the lead role (Bateman, in this case) and he relishes playing Gordo, the man who seems nice but actually has deeper motives. He knows the character more than anybody and I would be interested in seeing some sort of followup with his character!All in all, it's a great movie! Go and watch it!",The Gift
193,russellingreviews,Think twice before opening the door - 3.25 stars,7,17 August 2015,"'Let bygones be bygones'Walking into the cinema... It looks like a thriller on the level of Hitchcock, but what is the real message of this film? Overall Rating: 3 stars Cinematic rating: 3 stars Bigger questions rating: 3.5 stars Moving house can be exceptionally stressful. For Simon (Jason Bateman) and Robyn (Rebecca Hall) their move is to get a fresh start for their lives. They are excited about the beautiful scenery and the new neighbours in the suburbs. He has a new job with a multitude of upward mobility opportunities and his beautiful wife works from home and makes herself busy setting up their new home. Yet, things in their new world are not as idilic as they seem. As their story begins to unfold in this suspense thriller, as they look for new beginnings and put their pasts behind them, one of Simon's former classmates comes into their lives through a chance encounter. As happens after 20 years, it takes time for Simon to recognise ""Gordo"" (Joel Edgerton) from high school, but eventually the familiarity becomes apparent and leads to a series of events that will test the relational depth of this young couple. Gordo begins leaving various gifts at their door, comes by unexpectedly and gradually exposes Simon's past sins. Mistakes he made in this life that he wishes would remain locked away. Gordo's frequent visits grow in their level of cringe worthiness, but break through Simon's facade and show his dark side. As their lives unravel, Robyn begins to question if she truly knows the man that she has married. The Gift provides insights into the twisted existence of mankind through past memories, current relationships and the potential for revenge.Joel Edgerton (Exodus: Gods and Kings) wears multiple hats in this outing in film- making by plying his hand at writing, directing and acting in this twisted tale. He develops the needed tension with haunting imagery and gritty character development. The filming had a Hitchcokian flavour and each character was given a depth that uncomfortably unfolds with each new scene. The multiple layers of the story gave way to disturbing elements that deal with a topic that has plagued the human experience since Cain and Abel (Check out Genesis 4, if you do not know the reference). The script and direction provide the twists and turns that keep the audience off balance up until the disquieting end. Not wanting to give away too many plot points, this film will do for bullying what Fatal Attraction did for adultery. In this outing, Edgerton proves that he has the potential for multiple influences in this industry. Jason Bateman (Hancock) stretches his acting skills and moves out of his comfort zone of comedy to an exceptionally serious role. His hauntingly effective and tragic portrayal as the supposed loving husband who proves to have a sinister past is convincing. Rebecca Hall (Transcendence) shows the vulnerability and naivety that is essential for this young wife, but it is the performance of Edgerton that truly delivers this troubling journey of revenge. He has the look and feel of the person in high school that no one seems to remember, but still manages to get caught in the cross hairs of the high school bullies. Also, he shows the patient demeanour that is needed to deliver the creepiness factor to garner awards ceremony attention. The story line and performances are exceptional, but this film did leave a bitter after-taste on leaving the theatre. The story is exceptionally confronting and worth considering the bigger problems in society, but does not deserve the label of 'feel good film' of the year. The Gift opens the door to a multitude of discussions on the topics of relationships, revenge, bitterness and forgiveness. The relational layers provide various glimpses into the human condition and what is both right and wrong with the world. The common thread that pulls the story together and causes the lives of this young couple to unravel is bitterness. This cinematic thriller causes an evaluation of how we treat people throughout our lives. Understanding that at different times we do make mistakes in our dealings with those that come into our orbit, the need for forgiveness is an essential part of life. For the sake of drama, genuine forgiveness was the missing component in The Gift, but does not have to be in real life. Is there anyone that you need to forgive or ask forgiveness of today? Leaving the cinema... It is hard not to be deeply effected by a film like The Gift. Anyone who has been effected by bullying can relate to all of the characters in the film. It was well acted and directed, but hard to enjoy. As a life lesson it was fantastic, as entertainment it was disheartening. Reel Dialogue: What are some of the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. What does the Bible say about revenge? (Proverbs 24:29, Romans 12:19) 2. What does the Bible say about bullying?

194,samgiannn,"""The Gift"" lives up to its title in the best way possible",8,8 August 2015,"The 90's was the golden age of highly stylized stalker thrillers with flicks like Basic Instinct, Single White Female and The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, and the actor-turned-director Joel Edgerton hearkens back to those films with his directorial debut The Gift. In The Gift, young charismatic Simon runs into an old high school acquaintance named Gordon, and after a painfully awkward conversation, they go their separate ways. Simon's wife, Robyn, thinks it's just a chance encounters while Simon wants nothing to do with ""Gordo the Weirdo."" Gordon then slowly starts inserting himself into their lives and brings to light secrets about Simon's life, and Robyn realizes that she doesn't know who her husband really is. The thing that makes The Gift so unpredictable is the ambiguity of the villain. Initially, we think that Gordon is the villain since we seem him suddenly become too clingy and start stalking the couple, but as the plot progresses, Gordon reveals several secrets about Simon that make Simon seem like the true villain. Each secret revealed about Gordon and Simon twists the plot even further but not so much that it causes the film to meander through its story. This is a very controlled movie. None of the suspense comes from big chase sequences or any real action; it's the revelations about the characters that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The Gift is a surprisingly well-crafted and intense thriller film that feels like a throwback to the best 90's stalker flicks.",The Gift

I got this film in one of those Instaflix machines thinking it wasn't going to be that good just another so so 'thriller' but , after a relaxing , uplifting beginning making me feel fluffy and laid back the show moved in on my emotions and sensitivities and threw me into an exciting, significant, well acted, well written, well paced and wonderfully entertaining flick. Whatever i didn't like about the show is too darn insignificant to remember.

197,BillSims28,"Five Word Review: Intelligent, Uncomfortable Thrills; True Tension",8,7 November 2015,"The Gift is the directorial debut of actor Joel Edgerton (Warrior, 2011) and stars Edgerton as Gordo, a mysterious man who disturbs the life of happily married couple Jason Bateman (Juno) and Rebecca Hall (The Prestige). The true psychological thriller is hard to get right. I'd heard The Gift was good before going in to it but didn't want to get my hopes up too much (congratulations Hollywood on making me so cynical). Basically what succeeds in making The Gift so good is doing what all films of its genre should do - making the viewer feel as uncomfortable and tense as the victims in the film. And thanks to Edgerton's directing, the script by Edgerton and Edgerton's performance, coupled with the general effort of Joel Edgerton, one does feel very creeped out. His character's intense eyes, persistent spirit and creepy persona, along with the cinematography from the ""watcher's"" perspective looking in through windows, makes for a scary and twisty film full of mystery and surprises. What sets The Gift apart from other tense films with uncomfortable atmospheres is its intelligence. The sharp complexity of the script, and the all-round fantastic performances (notably from Bateman, who I'd never pegged as having such good dramatic acting skills, but also from the understated Hall) make for the three primary characters to all at different times take on the mantle of protagonist and antagonist. From the initial meetings between Gordo and the newly-moved-in couple to the unexpectedly good ending, far more depth is revealed about each character than expected, so that any and all of them could be the hero or villain, depending on perspective. It's intelligent enough to require a re-watch, if only to pick out all the minute details; the dialogue all has meaning to it, or is significant later in the story, as the full extent of the plan, and of the relationships, is revealed. I really don't want to give too much away, as you'd do better to go and watch The Gift now without knowing too much about it. I can't much fault it. Many will target the ending for leaving it too ambiguous, but leaving the audience wanting more is something more films need to start doing. It does perhaps drag in places, and a few scenes don't reach their full potential of scariness, but is for the most part consistently entertaining and frequently edge-of-your-seat stuff which will not fail to thrill, shock, and frighten you. A great debut for Edgerton. For sure you'll never buy a house with so much glass. 90/100",The Gift
198,mxsuba26,Spectacular revenge on a bully.,10,27 February 2021,"This is a good film about the long term effects of bullying on a victim who could not cope with it. The film gives subtle and not so subtle glimpses in the nasty personality of Simon in several scenes before his vicious final acts on his old victim and a new one. Gordo, the fragile and seriously damaged victim of Simon's high school bullying gets his devious revenge 25 years later in a most clever way without any physical violence (maybe or maybe not). Worth the time to watch. The only likeable character is Robyn who remains innocent to the crimes of both men but served as a pawn in their schemes. Very well done thriller. Good plot twists!",The Gift
199,sickofenjoyingmyself,"Menacing, cagey thriller",7,22 April 2016,"'The Gift' was an extremely enjoyable late night thriller for me. Constantly brooding with suspense, we are continually left to guess the outcome of Gordo and Simon's mysterious relationship which, as it unfolds, throws up many unexpected twists. The suspense continues right up until the finale - which is both shocking and unpredictable. Joel Edgerton is excellent as the awkward, creepy and uncomfortable Gordo. It's really hard to tell at any stage what his original intentions may have been when he re-encountered his old fellow school pupil Simon. Its equally hard to tell throughout the movie what his part will be in the dramatic outcome - but you know something is coming due to the impending atmosphere. I hadn't seen Jason Bateman in a more serious role before and thought that he was equally excellent as we witness his character change throughout the movie in ways we wouldn't have originally expected. He showed a depth to his range that was actually impressive. Rebecca Hall is also due a credible mention as she gave her character a depth that enhanced the quality of the suspense. At various points I even expected her to suddenly expose some kind of mysterious agenda of her own to further complicate the suspense. As thrillers do - it does leave unanswered questions and highly unlikely scenarios that in hindsight look extremely improbable. But not so much so that it detracts from the quality of a well acted and directed suspense thriller. Very effective late night movie.",The Gift

Naturally acted, beautifully and chillingly framed, and above all well-written, this movie is a must see for 2015.I'll see just about anything Jason Bateman is in, so since I love scary movies I thought, ""Hey, I'll see that."" I wasn't expecting much, which is perhaps why it was so overpowering. ""The Gift"" is a patient film that slowly, step by step, builds its suspense and conflicts. It takes its time, and it's really rewarding for the viewer. As writer, director, and star Edgerton nails it. One more thing I'll say - this movie has one of the best endings I've ever seen in any movie. Like ""Sleepaway Camp"" good. You have to see this movie - if you like thrillers and scary movies you will love it.Oh yeah also - one woman in the theatre screamed a full-on, as loud as you can possibly scream, scream about mid-way through.

I always find him pretty crass and unlikable in most of the roles that he is in, and I guess that's usually the point, but he just always rubs me the wrong way. That said, those particular characteristics kind of served him in this movie.This was the directorial debut of actor Joel Edgerton (Warrior), and I've gotta give him some credit, he pulled this one off pretty well, he wrote and directed this one, and it really feels like a throwback thriller that would have been perfectly in line with the ""single white female"" type movies of the 1990s. It all feels quite real and grounded, in a weird way, and that really works in the movie's favour. Edgerton did a pretty good job here, so I'm happy to give credit where credit is due.Jason Bateman is wholly unlikable by the end of the movie, and not in the usual way where I just can't stand his performance, but in a way that is really brought through from his character. The movie does try and give him back some redemption, sort of, but at that point it was just too late. Edgerton, as well as writing and directing, also plays Gordo in this movie, and does a pretty dynamite job. He has a real air of menace, from moment one, and I think that's really the point. It feels a lot like you know exactly where his character is going to go, and makes you feel like clearly there is a good and a bad guy in this. Thankfully, it offers an interesting twist on the standard idea.I know what you're thinking : ""Wait, Barley, did you actually like a movie?"", and yeah I think I finally did. It's not perfect by any means, there are some issues I took with the story. I found the underlying bullying message a little heavy-handed at times, but not enough that I would write this movie off. There's a scene with David Denman (The Office) that I pretty well could have completely done without, but that's me. It's pretty effective and pulls you in, and makes you wonder who it is that you're supposed to root for.I'll admit, I didn't know I enjoyed the movie as much as I did until I started writing this review, and it's possible that I enjoyed it more because of how wretched the last few movies I've seen were, but I'm not complaining. The other nice thing about this is that it doesn't try to be the ""NEWEST AND MOST EXTREEEEME"" horror movie around. It plays things really simply, it is effectively tense when it needs to be, the dude doesn't murder the dog, it just works for me on that level. Rather than trying to outdo the last guy, this one plays it pretty safe and it works. Now, that's not to say that safer is better by any means, but its nice to see a bigger horror movie not trying to measure its dick against the last one.If you haven't guessed yet, the movie works and you'll probably enjoy it. It's an easy watch and a pretty short watch. Well acted, well directed, and has its genuinely creepy moments. All the while, it takes a pretty standard format, and turns it on its head enough to make it interesting. Check it out.www.barleydoeshorror.com",The Gift
216,JontheLobsterLover,"Sympathy for the ""villain""",9,24 August 2015,"I was hooked on this movie from the very beginning. I'm not going to go into details on the cinematography, or the score. What really made this movie great were the characters themselves.From the trailers you are already presented with the idea that Simon is not as innocent as he claims to be. As the movie progresses we are shown just how messed up he was, and is. Not only towards Gordo, but to his wife, and even to random people just to get ahead. It's nice to see Jason Bateman do something besides comedy, and actually be good at it. You feel sympathy for the wife for obvious reasons. But I also felt sympathy for Gordo, one of the movies ""villains"". Does he do some messed up stuff? Oh absolutely. But in the end it was Simon who started the whole process, and who apparently has not grown up because he's still the same bully that he was in high school. I also found myself rooting for Gordo just for the fact that everything that he did was so well planned, and in a sick kind of a way I was actually impressed with how well he pulled everything off. A little bit of a predictable ending, but overall it was an amazing thriller. One of the best I've seen in a while.",The Gift
217,niriath,A lot of build-up to very little,4,19 June 2020,I expected a lot more to be honest.

I was really underwelmed at the ending..,The Gift

220,brandon_veracka,Excellent Film,8,8 March 2018,"If you like a movie that constantly keeps you on the edge of your seat (in the psychological sense) and thinking, then you're gonna love this. Mystery and intrigue abound in The Gift, which at no time slows down or gives the viewer a break from the action. On top of a simply great story with all the trimmings that make for a good film, there's also a bit of a moral to take away. I don't often say it, but this one really is a must-see.",The Gift
221,said-buet10,This is how thrillers should feel like,8,12 July 2017,"Went in to see this movie with high expectations and this didn't let me down. It is a proper thriller with a great story, great acting and great direction.The story is superb. Its original and exciting. A viewer will for sure feel all the awkwardness,fear,uncertainty,contempt and the jump scares to their bones. The director did everything perfectly. He showed just enough, nothing more nothing less. I liked this style a lot.On the acting side Bateman and Edgerton were extraordinary. Rebeca Hall was pretty great but these two were the main reason this was so exciting and frightening to watch. I didn't think Bateman could do serious stuff this seriously to be honest.It was a thriller and it thrilled me every moment I was watching it. Loved it and I think it completely deserves all the praises its getting from everyone.",The Gift
222,Lursa,"Wickedly, Creepily Awesome",10,8 August 2015,"This review will contain SPOILERS!!Sometimes you walk into a theater, plop down in your seat expecting to be mildly entertained and are instead blown out of your chair. The Gift is the movie that does that this summer.The Gift has been advertised as yet another version of Fatal Attraction. It is NOT! Don't even think of that movie because if you liked that one this one is going to disappoint you. You will think you see a scene from Fatal Attraction about to play out and it will take off in an entirely different direction. The movie does have an atmosphere that will totally have you jumping out of your chair. You will think you know what's going to happen next and most of the time you will be wrong.The movie is written and directed by Joel Edgerton. You may have seen him in Zero Dark Thirty, or Warrior. I first remember him from King Arthur. I loved him in Kinky Boots. This is his first time directing a full-length film (he has a couple of shorts under his belt...no pun intended).I went to see this because I did not want to see the other offerings at the multiplex. So I thought it would keep me awake until I could slip quietly out of the theater to meet my friends for a late lunch. I blew off lunch because I was totally drawn into the story. I could not wait to see what would happen next.The writing is tight. The directing is masterful. The acting is on point. It is as close to perfect as you are likely to see in a late summer movie. So let's get to those spoilers, shall we?The story revolves around Simon (Jason Bateman in a career-changing role) and Robyn who have moved to California from Chicago because Simon has a slick new job and Robyn is recovering from something tragic in her immediate past. Abuse of prescription drugs is only one of the things that haunts her. She is fragile and is played well by Rebecca Hall (Remember her from Iron Man 3 and Transcendence??). Simon, at first, appears to be the perfect husband. He is supportive, loving, attentive but gives off the vibe that everything is not as perfect as he makes it appear. They even have a charming, lovable dog to round out their family. They move into a beautiful home that has WAY more windows than it should. Okay, got a question...Why do the people in thrillers move into houses where the creepy guy can look in on them interacting with no problem? Have they not heard of blinds, curtains, sheers for Pete's Sake?! I digress....Simon and Robyn bump into a guy from Simon's past at a store. The guy, Gordon (or Gordo) is played by Edgerton. Gordo went to high school with Simon and starts dropping by their house leaving gifts by their front door and trying to ingratiate himself to the couple. Alarm bells start going off the minute this guy comes on screen but Robyn thinks he's a good person. Simon wants the guy to go away. Whatever you think you may know or figure out from the first part of the film is totally wrong. Edgerton builds a wonderful house of cards that comes crashing down and no one is left unscathed. The film is not about lost or tortured love. It does not have gratuitous violence or sex. It is an intense thrill ride of a movie. The Gift is about how the past never is truly past. It is about how once something is done it can never be undone. It's about revenge and how the choices we make will come back to haunt us in ways we can't imagine. I am recommending this film to anyone who loves thrillers. It is flawless. You will not be disappointed.",The Gift
223,MarcoLara,The gift...that keeps on giving,9,7 November 2015,"What can I say...I loved this movie but it gets a bit long at times. Other than that, superb film......and what is not to like? This is a thriller as thrillers should be. You think you know what's going on, then you don't. Then again you think you do, then you don't. And by the time you think everything is said and done, there are still more surprises to come.I cannot recommend this movie enough, saved for the fact that it seems slow at times. Then again, we are not watching an action show.I personally loved the twists even though they should be expected...if you were paying attention.Watch this movie. You will love it.",The Gift
224,Icedooitle,Yuppie Comeuppance,7,14 November 2015,"When it comes to a freshman effort, the immediate inclination is to grade on a curve. However, not all freshmen are granted the same resources as first-time director Joel Edgerton. The Gift has an unremarkable premise with a capable cast. The done-to-death conflict of the past coming back to haunt the protagonist usually has a hook that is either satisfying and new, or forgettably played. Somehow Edgerton's screenplay is both. It is admirable to have a passion project that is based in a writer's well rounded interest. It appears that Edgerton has done his homework for this film, but it does come across as derivative. Simon and Robyn (Jason Bateman, Rebecca Hall) are buying the house of their dreams in a new town. Within a week of their arrival, a nobody from Simon's youth stages a happenstance encounter. Gordo (Joel Edgerton) is the socially awkward ""nice guy"" that you would rather not have glomming onto your new life with unrealistic expectations of requited friendship. Day after day, he visits the couple's house bearing thoughtful, but tedious gifts, only when Robyn is alone. Simon confesses he barely remembers the man, and that Gordo's interests are more inclined to Robyn than nostalgia. Hall plays Robyn as the sweetly naïve wife who would deal with unwelcome guests for the rest of her life, just to avoid being rude.As is expected from the premise, Gordo is not all he seems to be, and the couple themselves hold the audience at arm's length for over half the film. If you saw the pre-view, you know more about the plot than I did at the 1 hour mark. This is the pacing sensitive nature of psychological thrillers. The unfolding is as formulaic as the tense fragility between the couple in their abode. It's a not-too-subtle nod to the situation that Gordo brings a gift of window cleaner one day. This couple, under the scrutiny of their visitor (and us), does in fact live in a glass house; a home that would be welcome in almost any yuppie comeuppance story. At its core this is a mystery, which precludes a description of most of the mile markers in the plot. It keeps you guessing so often that it's easy to overlook that how unsatisfying the answers are. This method of disclosing information does have an eerie way of making the viewer complacent until the right moment. These moments are too few but commendable from a story that doesn't fall back on shock value. Overall, that is what this film has to offer that is new to its genre. There are almost no misleading, unnatural character developments. Too often in thrillers the deceit is played like the characters know the audience is watching. These characters save their mind-games for each other. I was glad to be left out of the loop.",The Gift
225,ario-34119,Misled by the marketing angle,7,6 March 2019,"Don't get me wrong, it's a good film. Good wriiting, direction and superb acting. However, as I expected a thriller, I thought the initial pace was very slow, until I found that it was not a thriller at all and the pace went as slow through to the end. You might say it's a mystery drama with a hint of thriller. Thank God the acting kept me going, though, because it delivered good thought provoking story and a good twist.",The Gift
226,Sidd_The_Movie_Slayer,Simon Says Go Watch this Movie,10,7 August 2015,"The Gift is written and directed by Joel Edgerton. It stars Joel Edgerton, once again, Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall.The Gift surrounds a married couple(Jason Bateman, Rebecca Hall) as they transition into a new job, new house, new neighbors, new friends, basically a new life. As they shop for furniture Simon(Jason Bateman) encounters an old acquaintance from High school, Gordon or Gordo(Joel Edgerton), with a creepy demeanor and an obvious grudge.The Gift is Hitchcockian. I can't call it anything it isn't. I went into this movie with medium expectations and left with a newfound respect and awe for one person. This person is Joel Edgerton. As a director, he can't do wrong. The shots were inspired and eerie. He cut at just the right times to ensure the audience is terrified but not disgusted. As a writer, he can't do wrong. This is honestly one of the best scripts of the year and I hope it gets an Oscar nomination. It was so well written. The major player in both the direction and the writing is that no serious violence was portrayed in any scene in this movie but yet it manages to crawl under your skin and linger long after the movie's over. This is partly thanks to the excellent cinematography by Eduard Grau. Finally as an actor, CAN'T DO WRONG! He was creepy as hell but yet you some how want to root for him. He plays the role magically and was by far the best part of this movie. Jason Bateman, oh how woefully I doubted you. At first I didn't think he could pull it off. But he did. He was perfect as well. he was sly and slimy as well as awkwardly funny and relatable ( before everything goes down). Rebecca Hall in many ways was the main character. She did great. Though she wasn't as good as Edgerton or Bateman, she certainly held her own. Another great aspect of the movie was the soundtrack and the score. It fit perfectly to the subtly creepy atmosphere. Finally Since the script was so well written the viewer is left in ambiguity towards the morals of a character and I find this masterfully executed with every twist and turn being virtually unpredictable.All and all I loved this movie. Some might argue that the pacing is a bit off nut with such a short runtime. Certain things are justifiably stretched our skimmed. personally I didn't find this much of a problem. The Gift IS my favorite movie of the year so far and is a must see. The Gift gets an A+ or a 10/10. Simon says go watch this movie!",The Gift
227,jadflack-22130,If this was a gift i wouldn't keep it.,5,12 August 2017,"This film seems to get a lot of positive ratings,well everybody's different and entitled to their opinion. My opinion is that it is very contrived and a big fuss about nothing. When the plot is revealed, none of the characters are blameless. The Joel Edgerton character is creepy, the Jason Bateman character untrustworthy and the Rebecca Hall character annoying. People talk about the Hitchcock references but all they show for me is how superior Hitchcock films are to this uninviting and forgettable film. Didn't really do a lot for me.",The Gift

Rotten Tomatoes gave this 91 out of 100 which I find incredible, considering they frown upon the pedestrian, drawn out, un-thrilling films, with little originality or believability. And the reviews here are just as mystifying for me. But like I said, Iam no expert.The characters: well, the wife is just plain annoying with her whingy, whiny voice, always seeing the good in people, even when they break into her house and poison her fish and abduct her pooch. And she kept saying, oh its probably all my imagination. Yeah right.The husband is what keeps this film watchable, just. His mult-layered personality and history I found somewhat interesting. It became like could I believe anything he said, even though I believed he loved his wife and wanted to be a good dad.The stalker reminded me of a younger Bruce Springsteen and I was waiting for him to gift an acoustic guitar at any time. But no such luck, he is nothing more than an unwanted distraction, delivering no thrills or frights.

I will say this - everything is justified and there is no 'comes out of no where, last minute reveal that makes no sense what so ever' ending.

231,vampiri,Not your ordinary psycho stalker movie,7,11 October 2015,"In my opinion psycho/stalker movies are as hard to make believable/fresh as, say, haunted house movies. Why? Because how much can you divert from the genre without making the movie a whole other matter?Plot: mid-thirties couple moves to the suburbs to make a fresh start. To their surprise someone from the past turns up to shake the foundations.The Gift, to me, feels, not totally of course, somewhat fresh. How so? Stalker movies have: 1. the stalker 2. a couple/bunch of friends to be stalked and usually killed off 3. usually a lame revenge motive 4. often over the top psycho behavior (boiling rabbit a.k.a Fatal Attraction).The Gift have points 1 and 2, but not so much 3 and 4 (thank God) which makes it ""somewhat fresh"".The revenge motive is kept suspenseful and intricate as is the revenge plan. Since this genre is quite narrow when it comes to narrative, genre ""ingredients"" and number of carachters it is hard to write about the story and its development and carachter development without revealing too much, I limit myself by saying it is thick and interesting and it makes you wonder how it will end. Well, maybe not as much ""how"" as compared to the journey to the end.However, what is the most rewarding and surprising is the acting of Joel Edgerton (both writer and director of this movie) which blew me away. Rarely do I see such transformation/up grade of acting skills/portrayal to the better, at least to this extent. Edgerton is superb. I have always liked him, but for a long while he has been stuck portraying low key carachters with not so much to say. Which in turn might explain the choice to both direct and write. He manages to convey vulnerability, determination, psychotic behavior and ingenuity with total believability and subtleness.Although not a big fan of Jason Bateman's, I still have to recognize his effort. His portrayal of a carachter willing to keep his life as it is is uncanny.The weak points of the movie is the genre itself which is hard to make surprising and Rebecca Hall whose carachter is common and uninteresting. On the other hand, the chemistry in this genre lies in the connection between the lead character/-s and the villain since the plot revolves around the them.If a movie could solely be reviewed based on one actor's performance I would give The Gift 10/10, but since that is totally nonsense and due to the limitations of the genre itself, I give it 7/10. If you enjoy the genre in general and films such as Fatal Atttraction and Disclosure you will enjoy this one.",The Gift
232,Dextronix,Edgy and tensely entertaining **NO SPOILERS**,8,3 December 2017,"This film is superbly entertaining in a film type that's been done to death. Joel Edgerton has made a really enjoyable thriller here.A few moments have glorious jumps and unexpected bumps. A dark second half of the film is very welcome. The vagueness of getting to grips with who are the good guys and who are the bad make this a very original plot where it could just have been a copycat film.Bateman is effortlessly good in this as all things, but for me, Rebecca Hall is the star here. She is just mesmerisingly good.Top film. A creepy 8 out of 10 for me",The Gift
233,doofuspoofus,A true tale of what goes around comes around,10,9 August 2015,"This movie was about as impressive as writing can get. I mean the utter suspense of this film was just present around every corner. The direction was wonderful and the performances. Kudos to Jason Bateman. This was a different character for him to play as he usually plays the funny guy with the heart of gold looking for a break.When you see these types of films you expect them to be really predictable to a point where it's boring (I.E No good deed, the boy next door, or Secret Window) not that I didn't enjoy the films I mentioned; predictable films can still be entertaining but this for me had me curious throughout. I love movies that leave no loop holes in the end and just form a perfectly complete puzzle which it did. I also enjoyed and didn't expect the scares. It had a little horror mixed in with the suspense but not so much that it took away from the film.This was a story that fully shows that a person's actions good or bad can always come back to haunt them and even the simple message of the film wasn't too in your face. I love how Simon says ""some people just don't change after high school"" because in the end that was more true about him than Gordon. See this film.

234,saymaraza,The Gift review,8,27 March 2016,"With it also being a film directed by Joel Edgerton as well as starring, I think Edgerton did a great job with this one. It was very enjoyable the whole way through, with an incredible twist delivered at the end of it which I did not see coming. Talking about Edgerton in directing, I think he could be a great director as well as Actor, as the film was very powerful, with also a powerful performance by Edgerton throughout the film as the creepy character of 'Gordo' Whilst watching the film, I began to feel sorry for edgertons character, which is a sign that Edgerton played him perfectly and it gave me the impact that he intended to give. Jason Bateman was also very good in a leading role, but I'd have to say that Edgerton stole the show, with him twists and turns involved, it is definitely a film to see.",The Gift

Without giving anything away, this is a by-the-numbers thriller with no surprises and a lot of questions left unanswered. The actors are talented but the script is pitched at a B-movie level. The final shot doesn't even make much sense. It could be that I'm just a jaded old guy that's seen way too many movies that are similar to this one. That being said, here are two things I liked: 1. The dog, Mr. Bojangles, is awesome. 2. The screenwriter does go out of his way to reference Jerry Jeff Walker when explaining how the dog got named.",The Gift
236,doveed,Painfully Average,7,16 November 2018,"Just watched this move for the second time. When I decided to watch it this time, I didn't realize until two or three minutes into the viewing that I had already seen it. That goes to show you that it didn't leave much of an impression the first time. When I rate a movie 1 to 10, I consider whether the filmmakers involved hit the mark they were going for. A certain movie may not be my cup of tea, but if the filmmakers hit their mark, I usually at least give the movie a 6 or 7. The Gift hits its mark, but that's all it does. It's well crafted, but it brings nothing new to the stalker genre. And the performances are very predictable. The stalker is adequately creepy, the victims are adequately distressed... If you like these kinds of movies and you have nothing better to do, give it a watch but don't expect anything special.",The Gift
237,El-Kapitoshka,Don't be a bully!,8,1 August 2016,"If there's one thing we can all relate with- it's having hindsight and the thoughts of wishing to turn back the clocks to undo something stupid that we have done while younger. Jason Bateman plays that role perfectly as Simon and as a result of something stupid he did in school, time did eventually deliver what I felt to be something he deserved. I caught myself at multiple times thinking 'don't say that!', and 'why the hell would you do that?'. It got me thinking about the fragility of peoples lives, how easy it is to get swept up into something that may not be entirely true. I grew to dislike Jason and start rooting for the 'bad guy' played by the awesome Joel Edgerton and felt myself identifying with the wife- somewhat caught in the middle of this mess of a situation. Towards the end, it's clear that both Simon and Jason are probably more similar than they would care to admit and both seem in the wrong so to speak.The pacing is superb but there was just one odd (potential) plot hole, the main one in my eyes that Jason is prepared for Rebecca Hall (the wife of Simon) to see the weird video he did at the end after sewing up Simons fate nicely at the hospital (this really is not what it seems if you just read that line), which kind of doesn't suit his character overall in my opinion because I felt like Jason was smarter than that.Anyway- this doesn't distract from how good this movie is with a subject matter we can all relate to. I found myself thinking there should probably be some sort of children's adaptation of this to show the importance of not spreading rumours and being malicious, but perhaps there already is a film like this- no I'm certain. But this is merely an important adult reminder, with of course the moral of the story being 'Don't be a bully'.",The Gift

240,bardia-moose,Great Directorial Debut For Joel Edgerton,8,16 September 2015,"THE GIFT is a dramatic thriller written and directed by Joel Edgerton, starring Edgerton, Jason Bateman, and Rebecca Hall. It centers on married couple Simon and Robyn who unexpectedly run into someone from Simon's past. After a troubling series of uninvited encounters and mysterious gifts, a horrifying secret emerges; one that will cause Robyn to question how well she actually knows her husband. Edgerton is able to brilliantly build suspense with the passing of each scene. The way this film is shot and put together will keep you on the edge of your seat for the entirety of its runtime; just as the characters became paranoid you become paranoid. And just when you think you know where the film is going BOOM, it goes the complete opposite direction. As incredible of a job he did directing and penning the script, Edgerton delivered on the performance side of things as well. With a character such as his, it's really easy to come off as over-the-top. But, thankfully, he didn't fall into that trap. In fact, he went above and beyond of what was expected; perfectly depicting a creepy, yet subdued guy who keeps you guessing the whole time. Honestly, it's all in his eyes; you see him as this intrusive and invading character, however you can also sense a whole world of pain just by watching his eyes. He keeps you fully engaged, but if that was, somehow, not enoughyou have Jason Bateman. Bateman has always been an actor who's never fully disappeared into a role. When I see him in a movie, I see Jason Bateman; I don't see the character. That couldn't be further from the truth here; I saw a side of him I've never seen before. Rebecca Hall was great as well; she served as the keyhole through which we saw the film. In terms of not knowing the history between Edgerton and Bateman's characters, the audience and her were on the same page. Is Edgerton on the same path of a guy like actor-turned-director Ben Affleck? It's too soon to know for sure, all I know is THE GIFT is a great start.",The Gift

242,DoubleOscar,A Great Success for a First Time Director,9,1 September 2015,"As many people were, I saw the trailer for The Gift and assumed it would be yet another cheesy movie about stalkers. The plot overall isn't that captivating. It centers around a family who just moved and a person from the main character's past continues to leave gifts at their front door. Yeah, not so interested. However, I heard a few people saying to give it a chance and check it out, so I did. Boy was I glad I did! This is easily the biggest surprise of the year so far and caused me to really take notice of what Joel Edgerton can do both behind and in front of the camera.As mentioned before, the plot centers around Simon (Jason Bateman) and Robyn (Rebecca Hall) who are interrupted as they move into their new house by a person from Simon's past, Gordo (Joel Edgerton). From there, things take a turn for the worse as Simon and Robyn are continually bothered with gifts as they try to settle into their home. Seems like your average stalker movie, right? Wrong. There are so many twists and turns throughout the magnetic script that causes the viewer to question every characters motivations and who is really the hero or villain. This constant sense of not-knowing who's really who creates some masterful tension alongside brilliant performances. I like to refer to this movie as The Shining meets Nightcrawler because of the way the camera moves and follows the character to build suspense and how there is no clear cut protagonist or antagonist.Overall, The Gift is a magnificent achievement for Joel Edgerton as he moves forward in his directing career. With just one film, he has already proved himself to have the knowledge behind the camera equivalent to some seasoned directors. Definitely check this one out.""You think you're done with the past, but the past is not done with you.""",The Gift
243,brendandevere,Simon Says.............,8,7 September 2015,"I always go into a cinema unprepared for the impact of a successful thriller, not because I dislike the genre but more to the fact that I tend to be a big wuss. With my heart beating at a dangerously high level of 200bpm, it is a miracle that I haven't gone into cardiac arrest. I often find myself on the verge of shouting out at the theatre screen but control my urge before an annoyed and confused audience evict me for spoiling their enjoyment.The thriller is the hardest genre for a director to master. Get it wrong and the whole production will fall over. Get it right and you could quickly find that Hollywood has just labeled you the 'new Master of Suspense'. Unlike other film categories that have the capability to distract you with mesmerising CGI or blockbusting action, the thriller has very little margin for error. Alfred Hitchcock would rate his own productions on the gasps, shrieks and screams that could be heard coming from the theatre. A quiet cinema meant the Master Director had missed the mark.Joel Edgerton has got it right and delivered the audience a psychological thriller that messes with the mind and leaves you feeling breathless long after the final credits have rolled out. He has also lent his talent to the page, creating a story that slowly simmers away before catching fire in all its magnificent glory, reminiscent of a suspenseful old school Hitchcock thriller from the past. Marvellous stuff!Simon (Jason Bateman) has returned to California with his wife, Robyn (Rebecca Hall) after spending their married life living in Chicago. After some difficult times in the Mid-West, it is a chance for the couple to start fresh in a new environment. While they are out purchasing household items, a school acquaintance by the name Gordo (Joel Edgerton) recognises Simon in the store. He presents Simon and Robyn with several generous gifts but Simon starts to question Gordo's motives, believing the socially awkward school buddy is a few sandwiches short of a picnic basket. Robyn feels that Gordo's intentions are harmless but Simon confronts him nevertheless and politely warns his acquaintance to stay away. This is where the film starts to catch fire. Simon's past is slowly revealed to his wife, who begins to realise that her husband is not the man she thought he was.Casting Bateman in the role of Simon was a brave decision by the first time director but the risk paid off as he gives one of his most complete performances on the big screen. It was the chance Jason Bateman needed to spread his wings beyond his stereotypical outings in buddy films and clean skinned all American good guy productions. We get to see a different side to his acting abilities as the film progresses. Rebecca Hall is convincing as the troubled and volatile wife and Joel Edgerton plays his part superbly. His blank expressions throughout the movie only add to the suspense but he also is able to bring an engaging lonesome character to the story that resonates with the audience. You can't help but feel drawn in to his quiet and awkward behaviour. He is an actor that is accumulating an enviable resume. Edgerton has picked his roles carefully allowing his talents to grow through the different characters he portrays. This is a great little thriller for anyone to enjoy. It builds the tension nicely to a climax that will leave you feeling fulfilled. It hasn't relied on an overdose of violence preferring to seep the suspense into the audiences mind with crafty scenes, meticulous attention to detail, strong characters and an eerie score.",The Gift
244,ssunny-social,One of the Finest Debut,8,8 November 2015,"It is a little late talking about this film, since it released more than 2 months back, but the film is worth talking about any time. This, a directorial debut for Joel Edgerton (actor, Zero Dark Thirty), is a fantastically written and implemented psychological thriller along the lines of Old Boy(2003) and The Hand that Rocks the Cradle(1992). Joel has shown tremendous maturity as a director with his first film itself, and he executes every element close to perfection. The film is a dark play of psychologies of the battles between the bully and the bullied. Unlike Old Boy though, he doesn't add layers of emotions or melodrama but pure thrills which again works for the way he directs. The music definitely lacks a bit of a punch but the raw acting, dark suspenseful cinematography and a lonely themed production design is terrific. He's surpassed many acclaimed directors in bringing it all together with so much sync. Don't hate me for this but I think comparing debut films, this is better directed than Reservoir Dogs, 400 Blows, Gone Baby Gone or even Citizen Kane (I'm only talking about direction here, not about the story arch or its influence in pop culture).",The Gift

Plot holes the size of TX aside, this movie was boring and sucked. Bateman's wife has apparently lost a child and is struggling to get pregnant. A guy from high school who knows Bateman runs into him in a store. Apparently Bateman started a false rumor he was gay or molested or both. For some reason this part remains esoteric. Naturally the boy's father upon hearing the false rumor does what any father would do...he tries to kill him? For being molested? WTF? It gets better. Rather than admit any of this to his wife, he has the guy over for dinner and pretends he doesn't remember any of this, so naturally the victim hatches an elaborate plot to drug and rape Bateman's wife and videotapes it all. Naturally the woman who can't conceive gets pregnant from being raped the one time and the rumor victim's revenge is complete. Horrible casting, a story that could never stand on its own due to preposterous premise after preposterous premise, and Prozac-attack acting all make this stinker DRAG ON FOREVER.

251,lwood28,One Of The Best Thrillers In Years,9,8 August 2015,"The Gift is one of the best thrillers I've seen in a long time. This Gift is almost a perfect film. When I first saw the trailer for this film I really didn't think it would be that good. But when the film was released it was really good reviews and everyone was praising the movie. Everyone was also saying how the ending is shocking so I decided to check it out. After seeing this movie all I can say is ""This is probably one of my favorite films of 2015 so far."" The acting in this movie is amazing. Joel Edgerton and Rebecca Hall are really great in this film but the one person that stand out the most was Jason Bateman. Bateman's performance in the film is probably his best role yet and I think his is one of my favorite performances of the year so far. When I was watching this film I didn't see actors acting I saw real people and that why Edgerton's writing was so good. And his directing was also great in the film. This is probably one of the best directorial debuts from an actor I've seen in a while. The film did have a Hitchcock feel to it because every scene is slow and very tense and my heart was pounding in those moments and I was on the edge of my seat. The ending of this film is shocking and it made me feel sick in my stomach for awhile. One minor problem I have with this film is the jump scares now there weren't that many in the film but it felt cheap and didn't feel right. But I would have to admit there was one good jump scare in the film and if that was the only one in the film that would've been great. Overall please see this movie it deserves all the money it could possibly get and whatever you do don't see the trailer just look up what the film is about and see this movie you won't be disappointed by it.",The Gift
252,KillerRomance,A Surprising moral Thriller with a cerebral twist. No murder like illuminati movies. Very smart movie.,10,25 July 2020,"A married middle class couple, Simon Cullum (Jason Bateman) and Robyn Cullem (Rebecca Hall) from Chicago move back to Los Angeles due to Simon's new job in a Sales company as Robyn continues with the successful business in interior design. During shopping for home accessories in the high street, they meet with Gordon ""Gordo"" Mosley (Joel Edgerton) who knew Simon back in high school. So they invited him over to the house. Shortly after, Simon displays odd condescending attitude and epithets towards Gordon and wrapped up gifts show up one at a time at the modern achitectural Cullem home as Gordon visits Robyn. Secrets start to unravel. Including the truth.This is Joel Edgerton's debut in acting, directing, producing, and writing this movie. For a novice he pulled this movie off as a seasoned movie maker and his acting and visage reminds me of Elias Koteas. The photography of the movie is well shot, the dialogue is believable, and the direction along with the pacing is perfect. I was not bored one bit during the movie, I was intrigued to know what happened next.
I don't believe Gordo is harmful as most audience think, he never harmed a dog who went missing which I cared about and finally came back unscathed. Robyn had a past we get to understand, and I cared for both her and Gordo. The only one I despised was Jason Bateman's Simon, was he made to be hateful? Very much so, he reminded me of the bully from Octavia Spencer's Ma, so not the type of guy you want to award a gold medal for being sociopath of the decade. I heard he was a comedian and this was his first serious role, if that is the case then Joel knows talent when he sees it.
Look out for David Denman ( from Brightburn) who did a short but sweet performance as a Doctor helping out Robyn.
There is only a few jump scares which I know people hate but it's only a few so it doesn't not bother me because this movie relies on suspense and to me that is effective.
The movie had a Shakespearian story plot, because it is cerebral and no murder at last. How many illuminati movies had murder in a revenge movie? This is a decent movie to show pure Greek tragedy without the blood bath because it reflects not all good people want to harm anyone but just target those who deserve to pay for their evil actions. The movie got me thinking so much that I told my Twin Flame, and his family, my mother and my friends like wow! You got to see this film.

254,ja-191-280465,An edge of your seat kind of thriller and a wonderful gift it is,9,17 September 2016,"In his directorial debut, Joel Edgerton proves that all that glitters is not gold in this intense, psychological thriller. ""The Gift"" tells the story of a charming, young couple named Simon and Robyn who just moved from Chicago to L.A. for a fresh start. While shopping for household items, Simon is approached by a man named Gordo who attended high school with him. The two quickly catch up before taking Gordo's number and parting ways. At first, Simon and Robyn think of Gordo as a friendly, old acquaintance. However, his excessive politeness and intrusive behavior becomes exceedingly creepy as he slowly makes his way into the couple's life. Although Robyn considers many of Gordo's gestures to be sweet and generous, Simon can't help but think of him as just some oddball, weirdo trying to get closer to his wife. After an eerie and somewhat awkward dinner party, Simon cuts off all ties with Gordo and soon after strange things begin to happen. Their lovely dog goes missing, their pretty, little fish turn up dead and Robyn starts to feel more and more frightened in her own home. After doing some deep digging, she discovers why bygones are no longer bygones. A powerful secret from the past has caused a ruckus in her marriage and she soon realizes that her husband isn't as nice as she thought.One of the things that makes this film so compelling is the impressive story line. It consists of a highly interesting plot that keeps you guessing from beginning to end. Edgerton brilliantly avoids the use of terrible clichés which is part of what makes this story so effective. Edgerton also allows the story to unfold naturally while providing the audience with the chance to really get to know the characters. Each of the actors gave exceptional performances. Rebecca Hall is OK as the kindhearted, mild mannered wife. However, Jason Bateman gives one of the best performances to date as an unscrupulous husband who refuses to come to terms with a past wrong doing. More importantly, its Edgerton's edgy portrayal of Gordo that is haunting and mysterious. Friendly and unsuspecting, he's a gentle soul whose been hurt, humiliated and scarred in the past who may be in need of friendship, kindness and understanding. Perhaps he is a bit of a weirdo as Simon labels him in the beginning. Through his acting and directing, Edgerton masterfully toys with the audience's perception of Gordo as he causes us to question his various motives and actions. Through his sharp directing and dark imagery, Edgerton creates a tone that is ominous and tense. The dialogue further enhances the enigmatic nature of the film and remains very natural. Its simple and straight forward without being overly dramatic and unrealistic. The interactions between the characters are honest and direct without being too forced or melodramatic. Overall, ""The Gift"" is a wonderful debut by Joel Edgerton. I eagerly look forward to his next cinematic gift in the future.",The Gift

257,nyc man,"It should be called ""Boo"" when it tries to scare you",3,8 August 2015,"There are many times in this movie -- which was scary -- where I was (wrongly) afraid, just like someone yelling ""Boo"" out of nowhere. There are some plot holes, like wouldn't an Order of Protection (OOP) have worked? For instance, getting a visit,as well as going to the person, are prohibited by an OOP. And also getting an unwanted gift. That would've reduced the movie, much like cell phones would have reduced horror films where calling the cops solves much of the problems (instead of going down to the cellar to see who's there).Maybe I'm a bit too mechanistic in my solutions to this psychological thriller. I think calling ahead would solve many problems, but who knows. There are some good moments in this film, but I felt manipulated.I also wonder if some of the few reviews here for ""The Gift"" are by people paid by the film company. If that's the case, perhaps IMDb.com and its parent company Amazon should/can check the IP address of the submitters, to see if they're related to a film company or their agencies, sort of like what Wikipedia did to get rid of people changing their own pages / rewriting history.",The Gift
258,clewis2666,Stylish 'thriller' but unconvincing in many ways,4,9 January 2016,"I am really surprised that this film got so many rave reviews from the critics and equally from amateur reviewers. The film is well presented and the actors do as well as they can with the material they are given, but that is not enough because the plot – the script if you like – has to be effective, and it certainly isn't. It is as if the director wants to show how clever he is by starting the whole thing off for the first part of the film as a stylish thriller in the Hitchcock mould and then turns the whole thing on its head to surprise us. Yes, I found it surprising, but also disappointing and unconvincing. We were presented initially with the theme of a reasonably pleasant married couple being slowly traumatised by the increasingly weirdo former schoolmate of the husband who seems to be seeking to make best friends of the couple, particularly by loading them with unwanted presents. BEWARE spoilers. There is a reviewer called Alcor on the Meta-critic site whom I heartily recommend because he sensibly pulls apart the logic, or rather absence of logic, of the plot in a number of ways. I will simply list a few of my own: (SPOILERS!) Early on the weirdo, who seems from the start to be a down-at-heel loser, puts a present of fish in their pond and leaves fish food at the door. Later he appears to have killed the fish and to have taken their dog away. Some effort is made – oh how clever – to evoke sympathy for the weirdo, who was apparently bullied at school by the husband (he meets the husband by amazing coincidence many years later miles away from the school), and later there is a scene where the successful in-control husband beats the poor weirdo up (again, presumably). Oh, I forgot to say – he is too nice to have killed the dog, and simply slips the creature back home a little later. Meanwhile the weirdo has invited the couple to dinner in a gated mansion, to which he has apparently gained access through the garage door( he was only entitled to take a rented car from the garage). He spins them some story and leaves for a few minutes, during which time he makes a video of them, or at least a sound recording, having apparently been able to bug the mansion's living room (the owners know nothing of this!). He never tells them (until much later) that it wasn't his house and he shouldn't have been there, so how was he supposed to give them dinner? Was he going to take over the kitchen and do all the cooking himself? – that is never explained. We are told more than once that the husband ""ruined his life"" as far as one can understand the situation which is never clearly explained – by making up a story that the weirdo at school was seen in a car with another boy/man. We are given no further details. Meanwhile the beautiful and apparently poised wife, Rebecca Hall, is slowly being driven over the age into a nervous breakdown, having apparently only recently recovered from one. That enables some slender plot line to develop whereby the husband tells the wife that the weirdo fancies her and the wife pathetically evinces some sympathy for the weirdo There is also some incomprehensible side plot whereby the husband, coming out of his house after a shot has been fired and/or a window has been smashed, is clobbered by an assailant who we all imagine to be the weirdo but in fact turns out to be some bloke that he has beaten in the race for a promotion. That bloke then makes some sort of accusation, which we can never properly understand, that the husband sent some false email to discredit the bloke (no further details are given), and as a result the husband is in disgrace and loses the promotion and his job also. What utter rubbish! This bit seems to have been tacked on later, possibly as a sort of biblical lesson punishing the husband for his childhood bullying. The husband is also – oh so cleverly – shown to lose all sympathy when he loses his temper with the weirdo and beats him up brutally. Then the ending! -- meant to be like Wow! -- SPOILER we are supposed to believe that this no hope loser managed to get a key to the couple's house , managed to put a video bug inside, may have drugged the wife and may have raped her there and so would be the father of her new baby. Spare me, please! How could the professional critics not see any of this? How can one have the slightest confidence in them? They seem to see only the surface gloss and to be incapable of applying any sort of gentle and limited intellectual examination to the events of the film. If they did, they would find it to be a stylish farrago of nonsense.",The Gift

260,Rageypoo,The Gift is one of those you get that you want to return.,4,28 October 2015,"The movie for the most part revolved around 3 people, Simon and his wife, and a guy named Gordo. The movie has a very interesting plot, but really fails to deliver. The relationship between Simon and his wife is a bit of a mystery, they seem estranged or at the very least, distant, later we discover the reason behind it and the movie focuses on the issue quite quickly and deliberately which is fine, but seemed unnecessary considering what the main plot is suppose to be. ***Spoiler Alert***Gordon bumps into Simon and tries to chum up to him and his wife. Simon doesn't seem to remember who Gordon is but once he does, goes on a seemingly odd push to call Gordon a weirdo. Its not clear why he finds him so strange and so odd and does what he can to push him away, specially when he finds that Gordon seems interested in his wife. Its later revealed that Gordon was abused and bullied by Simon, and the story is basically Simon got everything and Gordon got nothing. Eventually through the movie, it seems there's an intention for revenge, with very slow and subtle intrusions on Simon's life. The wife seems to be overly defending of Gordon and when she discovers Simon has a history with Gordon, tries taking a moral high ground to have him reconcile with Gordon to the point where she wants to leave him after having a baby because she's just so fed up with the lies Simon makes about his involvement with Gordon. As it turns out, Gordon's obsession seems to be validated, and in Simon's efforts to bully Gordon to stay away from him and his family, ends up motivating him to set up a plan to get back at Simon by hitting him where it hurts the most. Simon wanted a baby badly, and now he has one, but has no idea if it is his or not, after Gordon gives Simon a tape that plants a seed of doubt to whom the father really is. It would be an amazing story, except that we don't know entirely the motivation for Gordon to do this. Sure he might have been bullied in school, but did it really push him so far as to possibly drug and rape Simon's wife just to get back at him? A simple paternity test would reveal what happened anyways, but my problem with all of it is that none of this seems to be enough motivation to break apart Simon's marriage, or really mess with Simon's life more than wondering if he had sex with her. The whole thing seems weak, and aside from a few deliberate jump scares, the movie felt very unlikely and unconvincing. Had it been convincing, this would have been an awesome movie, the very idea that someone gets their due justice from a bully is a great idea, but rather than gaining a moral victory it just seemed he became a sick twisted person and his revenge pretty unjust. It left me a bit disappointed. Great acting from Jason Bateman, Joel Edgerton felt like he fit the part well, but the part played by Rebecca Hall didn't seem like a good one for her, a drug abuser who's husband tried helping her overcome by relocating her to an amazing home in California with lots of friends, yet couldn't forgive him for having a past with a guy from simple bullying? Her drug addiction and as the story hints at, loss of their first child possibly due to a miscarriage or drug overdose or just using the drugs in general is forgivable, but Simon being a bully isn't??? I don't buy it. Overall I think the story had amazing potential, but I think the morally ""justified"" martyr wife was absurd, and I think the bully revenge could have been written a bit differently, maybe something more than a childhood bully revenge to stalking-harassing-possibly drugging and raping his wife is too extreme to believe, or even want to believe.",The Gift
261,adnan_soysal,- why would he do that? - because he could,8,6 September 2020,"I love the casual flow of the movie having again a casual suspense coupled with the right soundtrack.
A young couple moves to Los Angeles as a result of husband's (Simon) job change.
Wife(Robyn) does not work, but used to work in the past.
She wants to have a baby but somehow it just did not happen.
But also it looks like that she is not sure if she is happy with Simon, she feels something is odd with her relation.
In LA, Simon comes across a high school friend, Gordo, and they start socializing.
Old friend sounds like bit odd, scripted, psychopath.Movie is about the old wound Gordo suffered in high school because of Simon.
This incident caused miserable consequences in Gordo's life.
Now, it is time for Gordo's vengeance.Simon does not tell Robyn reason behind the strange behaviors of Gordo.
Robyn got suspicious about Simon's relation with Gordo, and start investigating.
While talking to another alumni from the same class, she has following dialogue.She asks to him
why would he(Simon) do that?answer
because he could.I love this dialogue.
In my view, entire narrative of the movie is based on this. It reminds me Nietzsche's ""You are not responsible for your actions""In the mean time Robyn got pregnant,
Simon got promoted to a new position at his job by eliminating the other candidate by smear.
While celebrating his promotion at home with colleagues, his victim stones home, breaks window.
All got out and Simon got him. Victim accuses Simon for his smear on him for the promotion.
Simon's manager. and others hear all this.Robyn was right about gut feeling on her husband.
He was a bully at high school, and can have a smear on others.
Ans he is still like that.She gave a birth.
On the day of having baby, Simon comes across three disasters
1- His company fires him after discovering his smear on other candidate
2- Gordo leaves him some evidences that baby might be from him OR not.
3- Robyn is not returning to Simon after hospitalyes.
Fakeness could haunt you, and eventually destroy you at your most happy moment.
One's fakeness could also result in others becoming psychopaths.
Because although Gordo was a victim, eventually he became a fake one, psychopath also.
And Robyn was right about her odd gut feelings about Simon.

I thought the trailer looked great but apart from Jason Bateman, i can't say that i was the biggest fan of the cast but this film may have changed that.. Joel Edgerton surprised me the most, i can't put my finger on why i didn't really like him in the past, there was just always something about him that irritated me. His acting was great in this film, he was brilliantly vulnerable but still slightly creepy, and he did a brilliant job of directing and i loved this story which he wrote. It really hit home with me as i also experienced bullying throughout my teenage years and i could definitely understand certain character motivations. Jason Bateman also did a great job of acting in a dramatic role, this was certainly a very different character to those he usually plays but he did still manage to make me laugh at points. Rebecca Hall also did a great job of pretty much carrying the film, I've found her to be pretty hit or miss but this was a brilliant role for her. I don't want to say too much, as everyone should experience this movie for themselves so i don't want to spoil anything.

First of all, it slowly becomes a completely and far more serious movie than the trailer suggests, which can be off putting for the Movie goers who just want to be thrilled, but I think it works for the better for this movie. Secondly, the movie title seems simple but is multi layered, as all characters are. It is up to the audience to give meaning to the the title and decide what 'The Gift' actually means.But the best part of this movie is the characters, which are so well developed both in writing and acting that you feel for all characters. They are all flawed characters who are hiding something and they all express their pain in a different way. Especially Hall, who slowly becomes the protagonist of the story gives yet again a stellar performance, hopefully one day she will get recognized.As for flaws, the tone of the movie shifts quiet a few times which reduces the tension a little bit in the middle part of the movie. Furthermore, although the characters are well developed, their back stories are often revealed using small references or short dialogue. This could have been more expanded for dramatic effect as the story line of the past is extremely interesting. But these are really small flaws, that you will completely forget towards the ending, which has one of the best movie twists ever, and will reward you as an audience for sitting through the entire time. And the movie will stick with you for a long long time.",The Gift
264,thependragonscribe,Joel Edgerton's psychological thriller brings the ultimate chills.,9,11 January 2016,"Joel Edgerton's directorial debut proves a promise for him in the future. For his first film, ""The Gift"" recalls previous attempts of the suburban psychological thriller genre (like ""Prisoners"" and ""Straw Dogs""). But with a hefty script by Edgerton, this gives it a unique take that not only stands out but seeps the skin deep. And in the center of this suburban haunter is a couple (Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall) who relocated in Los Angeles and encountered a cordial stranger (a sordid Edgerton) who may cover a story as overwhelming as his sudden presence. But his story is to remain a mystery until you watch it because ""The Gift"" is a chilling ride that truly plays with the psychological aspects to make every moment crawl under the skin. As every twist unfolds, the final outcome becomes satisfyingly devastating. And that is where the total brilliance of the story comes from. Props to Bateman for leaving his comedic chops for a while to play a successful man with a hidden past, being unraveled by Hall, as she becomes torn with the story unfolding. ""The Gift"" is indeed a present that one must open.",The Gift

268,analovescoffee,A flat thriller building up to....NOTHING! A gift that you should probably just re-gift,3,13 December 2015,"Having watched the trailer and read the reviews here, I thought this movie was going to be mind blowing. Well this was not the case!I love these types of movies, where the whole action builds up to an mind blowing ending when all the scenes and clues finally make sense and the pieces of the puzzle are put together. Well in this movie, the action is somewhat flat, but makes you think it's OK because it will have an interesting ending. The whole movie little stuff happens, nothing major. The only thing that i liked was that the movie was little longer than the average. In the video that Gordo sends, the woman is fully clothed. He doesn't even bother to remove at least the pants in order to make this guy believe that he ever did anything. Also, the main character doesn not know when he impregnated his own wife? Even the GYN doctor tells you. And this big revenge gift is absolutely nothing, anyone can verify paternity with a simple swab test or even blood work. And also, in the end, who is the real villain? They keep changing the bad characters.first it is gordo, than Simon, then gordo again, etc. and a lot of stuff does not make sense in the movie, like when Gordo takes of his shoulder support, implying that he was faking his injury. But he really did get beat up in a previous scene. In conclusion, this movie had a lot of potential that was unfortunately wasted.... The actors' performance is average .",The Gift

He sort of gets his in the end but not really. Not near the just punishment for the crimes he's committed. The person, who gets bullied, gets revenge, but not really. The plot twist at the end was not well defined. Mostly, it just took a long time to get to no point. Jason Bateman does not pull off the roll of the nice guy that has been hiding this monster inside for so many years that no one is the wiser. His wife's character is just a creepy wimpy woman that doesn't know her own husband. It was just a disappointing look into the human condition of what bulling can do to people as they get older.",The Gift

272,mcgregorrowland,A good edge of your seat thriller.,8,10 August 2015,I love suspenseful films. So naturally when I saw the trailer for this I was really intrigued. It made me even more excited that Joel Edgerton was directing and writing this film. So naturally I saw this film and I was not disappointed.This movie had great suspense. You kept getting surprised the whole movie and you found yourself at the edge of your seat a bunch. This movie also had some horror and creepy moments which added more to the suspense.Everyone doubted Jason Bateman because this was a horror movie. But boy were they wrong! He did great acting and I was very impressed with his performance. Rebecca Hall and Edgerton did very good as well.Edgerton's writing was great with a lot of twists and suspense. It definitely kept you at the edge of your seat and you were wondering what was gonna happen next the whole time you were watching.If you love edge of your seat thrillers and a lot of plot twists then you will love this film.,The Gift
273,Uberkills,Not the stalker movie you thought it was,8,8 August 2015,"I was sure wrong about The Gift. Trailers and advertisements have marketed the film as one of those generic psychological thrillers that may be heavy on plot and dull on characters but this is not what The Gift was. In fact, the characters Simon (Jason Bateman), Robyn (Rebecca Hall) and Gordo (Joel Edgerton) are so well crafted from the script, they will still sit in your head hours after watching actor turned director Joel Edgerton's successful debut.In The Gift, the story is about a man named Simon and his wife Robyn move into a new California home from Chicago and encounter a man named Gordon ""Gordo"" Mosley from Simon's High School past. Gordo begins to force a friendship on the couple by giving gifts but Simon doesn't want this man in his life because of Gordo's awkwardness and past as a ""weirdo"" in school. The Gift is essentially about the past. The actions one person did in the past and whether or not one should move on and forget about it. A line is spoken in the film, ""Let bygones be bygones"". This line or saying that puts itself as the theme of the film. I thought the character of Gordo was excellently played by Joel Edgerton, the director and writer of the film. He turned what could have been a generic stalker-villain caricature and made him a real human being the audience can empathize with. Having said that, the main character Simon can be viewed as a villain himself. Of all the movies that released in late July and August 2015, I recommend checking out the Gift. It's a film that cares about a story it wants to tell and characters it feels to explore. No explosions. No spectacle. Just great storytelling.",The Gift
274,tabestorm,Pretty darn good!,8,28 March 2020,"When I heard this movie could be a little slow, I wasn't looking forward to watching this. I hate it when movies just drag on. But this one wasn't like that. Maybe there were one or two scenes a bit too long or unnecessary, but that's it.From the start until the end every scene becomes more interesting and more suspenseful than the former. The tension is subtle, but sometimes you can really feel the fear.One of the things I liked about this movie is that you actually get some time to think what everything will lead to. You know it builds up to something, but you don't know what.
And another thing that I liked is that I didn't know any of the actors. I guess it's also because I haven't seen a lot of movies in my life. But I don't think the female actor was very famous anyway.Anyway... the movie isn't perfect, but if you like a good thriller and you've seen the very best, then this one is next.",The Gift

Its not a corny horror movie at all! its definitely one of the best psychological thrillers I have ever seen. I was writing a few business emails at the time so i put it on as background noise (assuming it was going to be stupid) but i immediately started paying attention when things started getting complicated, which is relatively quickly.I know this will expire soon, but its on netflix as of 5/20 and definitely deserves a watch.",The Gift
276,thenza,What's in the box!!!???,8,1 January 2021,"This movie was a genuine thriller the name though had me very confused and I was torn with the Thorton movie ideology. Otherwise this film will keep you speculating the truth and then it flips it on you. Bateman plays the straight man well almost sociopathic acting at parts sways towards the end but good performance. Hall with her short hair I dont care for reminded me a bit of Theron in devil's advocate plays a bit of the role of the audience and non the wiser.
What works amazingly well is the indie style filming of obscure close ups and aguemented cut a ways. The tension builds through out the film more and more which is why thrillers are my favorite genre and this is a good one! Of course the downfall is that it is a one perhaps two shot kill I cant see watching it again and again since knowing the end makes you feel dirty needing a bath.
Lies and truths this movie has a plenty, otherwise the last 10 mins or so seem horror movie like a bit over done climatic but it wraps the gift up very intrinsically and you have the aha moment. Disturbing but somewhat far fetched premise but otherwise an better than good thriller mystery worth the time, watch with friends or your significant other.",The Gift

278,d_stack04,"A smart, tense thriller beautifully executed by Edgerton",7,18 September 2015,"Joel Edgerton joins a large list of actors who have gone on to direct a feature with The Gift. He has also joined a much smaller list of actors who make an exceptional film with their directorial debut.The Gift is a thriller that is hard to take your eyes off of. We begin the story following couple Simon and Robyn, portrayed by Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall respectively, moving into a new house in a Californian suburb from their previous home, Chicago. After an encounter with Gordon (Edgerton), a man from Simon's past, the couple begins to receive a string of gifts. Whereas Robyn sees Gordon's gesture as hospitality, Simon thinks he has an ulterior motive.The acting performances in this film are top notch, especially from Bateman. After having achieved so much success in the past with comedic roles it's good to see him step outside of that and take on more serious material. Rebecca Hall does an excellent job in the role of Robyn, the character who carries the emotional journey as well as the movie itself. Last but certainly not least is Edgerton himself. The way he portrays Gordon really messes with your mind as to which character you sympathize with as the story is told.Edgerton also does an excellent job directing the film. The movie is on a slower pace, as a thriller should be to build tension, but it never really slows down the story. There's a good amount of twists and turns to keep the story from feeling sluggish. This isn't your typical thriller where there is a lot of violence, bloodshed, or, !!SPOILER!!, deaths. In fact, there are no deaths in this movie, on screen or off. The creepiness of the Gordon character is the source of your unease in this movie.While there are a few jump scares here and there, the real scary thing about this movie is its psychological manipulation. It makes you think about how you treated other kids in school and how you were treated back then. For the most part we have all grown up since high school and have matured but sometimes we hold on to our perspective of that person from back then and this movie plays on that.This movie ironically made me think of Adam Sandler, particularly the phone call scene with Steve Buscemi in Billy Madison. Maybe being a bigger man and apologizing for your previous sins can save you a load of trouble, it certainly would have for Simon in The Gift.I enjoyed this movie from start to finish and recommend it to anyone looking for a good story and a tense experience from a very talented actor/writer/director. I wouldn't call it a good date movie, but a enjoyable movie to see with a friend.",The Gift
279,Roman-pc,Fun but still intelligent thriller on bullying,10,28 May 2021,"""The Gift"" is one of those rare modern movies that show us that the art of film is not dead--can't remember the last time I saw a contemporary American movie that was so much fun yet with real substance and without the mind-numbing special effects and noise of the usual big budget fare.""The Gift"" then is a rare treat if you love cinema: I went in cold, not having read a line about the movie before, no trailers no reviews nothing whatsoever. I was just looking for something good enough to keep me focused away from what was a truly hectic work week--and this movie delivered. So do yourself a favor - if you haven't watched it yet, stop reading this review and go see it first.By way of plot here's all I will say: this film is on the face of it a deliciously taut thriller about a young couple who move to SoCal from Chicago, where the husband's high school friend gets back in touch, and a series of escalating events happen thereon.But ultimately the film is about bullying and the aftereffects thereof: if you've ever been bullied before in whatever stage of life, you will understand what's happening in the scenes between the Jason Bateman character (the husband) and the high school friend.Although much of our focus on bullying tends to be on kids or school life, a lot of bullying actually also happens in the adult world. As someone who's encountered my share of bullying in the past (and still do from time to time) from coworkers, bosses, even family members, this film hit close to home.In real life actually though, it's the serial killers and bullies who are the real charmers - would the charming bully then get their comeuppance or would the ""weirdo"" from school prove that he's still the same socially awkward misfit?",The Gift
280,Moviemanic22,Terrific psychological horror,7,28 February 2017,"Since their first horror movie 'Insidious', Blumhouse productions have made way for different and ingenious movies that were not only specialised on low budget but high on quality. They ended the trend of horror remakes that started mainly in 2002. The film wasn't exactly groundbreaking but it created a larger market for PG 13 movies. Their recent movie 'The Gift' is not really a horror film but falls more in to the category of psychological genre.Directed by Joel Edgerton who also happens to write and direct, the movie is about a couple who's lives are changed by the entry of a high school acquaintance from 25 years ago. Initially he offers gifts as a way of being accepted and desires to become a friend. His socially awkward behaviour is noticed by the husband and the stranger responds in a hostile manner by creating more tension and leading the wife in to the situation. Skeletons fall out of the closet and later background history regarding Gordon is exposed as well as what happened between him and the husband. Things escalate in to bad things and the stranger then unleashes his evil plans.The unique element of the film is clearly the script. Debutante director Edgerton maintains the suspense and intrigue elements throughout the movie. There.is rarely a dull moment. The first hour is straightforward but the the second hour is more unique. However what makes 'The Gift' different is that the audience doesn't know who Stranger is and what his intentions are. This keeps the viewer in suspense and mystery. The cinematography and direction should be given it's due recognition. Many scenes are shot close frame and the interiors of the home filmed in wide view give a haunting atmosphere. Edgerton has had done a commendable job in the directing department and many scenes are to a technical standard. This is not the first time a movie has been made with this theme. Many people will still remember Films like 'Cape Fear' and 'Fatal Attraction' and 'Old Boy' instantly as they fall under the same genre.I'm certain many would disagree but I was quiet annoyed with Robyn's role. As far as Rebecca Hall's acting is concerned, she gave a good performance and was very convincing as the wife. However I couldn't help feeling there was some adjusting required to her involvement to the story. She helped progress the story forward. But I felt she was crossing the limit with digging in to her husband's past. I'm sure she wouldn't like it if he did the same. Whatever Simon did 25 years ago had no connection to their relationship or marriage. He was there to comfort and emotionally support her when she had a miscarriage. This is clearly the reason why perhaps a flashback would have been necessary in the middle of the film to show to what extent Simon had damaged Gordon's life. This is sub standard sub plot procedure that would have benefited the film. I do not endorse what Simon did but I would have hated him more if we were shown in a little more detail the extent of harm he had done to Gordon's life.All actors gave a fantastic performance. Due to the nature of the film one would expect the mysterious character to have the better performance. But in this case I felt Jason Batemen out shined the others. He proves that as well as being comedy material he too can pull off serious roles. Rebecca Hall did her part well as the wife, who I actually ended up hating more than the husband. Joel Edgerton plays his character was ease. There was limited involvement from him in the second half. But I personally feel that his positive contribution stands out more in the directing and scripting. The highlight of the film has to be the confrontation scenes between Bateman and Edgerton. And the surprise ending just added the cherry to the cake. For those who enjoy this genre or if the theme is relatable, I can guarantee will enjoy this treat.",The Gift
281,KristianZacc,An Underrated Mystery Thriller,8,22 September 2015,"Vague/minor spoilersA few months before this film came out I was on a Jason Bateman 'high' watching some of his past movies that I had not seen, ""This Is Where I Leave You"", ""The Switch"", and ""Bad Words"" for example. I was curious to see his upcoming filmography and found that it was a mystery/psychological thriller, ""The Gift"" directed by Joel Edgerton. Even though I usually have a hesitation to watch any trailers out of fear of any spoilers, I wanted to get a feel of what the tone for this film was as no one I knew had even heard of this movie. After about a minute of the trailer I was sold.""The Gift"" is about husband and wife couple, Simon (Bateman) and Robyn (Rebecca Hall) moving into their new house in the suburbs of Los Angeles after finding a new job. While they are out buying supplies for their home, an old high school classmate, Gordon ""Gordo"" Moseley (Joel Edgerton) runs into them, and as the days go by he drops by their house unannounced, usually when Robyn is home alone, as well as sending many gifts to them. As I was walking into the cinema, popcorn and drink in hand, I was eagerly awaiting the next 120 minutes to see how the mystery would unravel itself on the screen. From the first scene I was very much engaged with the three main characters and how each of them interacted with each other, especially when they were between Gordo and Robyn. Edgerton turned out to be the true star of this film in his duel role of acting and directing. Many actors in Hollywood have turned to trying their hand in directing films. Ben Affleck and Clint Eastwood are some of the first ones that come to mind, and Edgerton definitely has a great future ahead of him in the field of a director. Throughout the movie, every time a hint was given that led to the potential reveal, I would break my own rule of never talking in a movie, and my friend and I would give our quick theories of how we thought it was going to play out. Some of them proved to be true and some were not even close. There was a point around 20-30 minutes into the film where something happened in Gordo's ""house"" that turned the movie from an interesting, slow moving film to an eerie, creepy, stalker-ish flick. It reminded me of Jonathan Kaplan's 1992 film ""Unlawful Entry"" in which we see Ray Liotta's character's true motivations come to fruition, just done better. Even though these elements were there before, it was cranked up to a much higher level after this moment and it made the film that much better. It also made it much more suspenseful, and at times there were a lot of ""on the edge of my seat"" intense moments that made my heart beat a little quicker, and it sucked me in and hooked me for the rest of the film. As the movie went on I figured that the trailer made it feel, tonally, like a completely different movie and I preferred what was taking place on screen much more than my only initial worry, which was that it could turn into a jump scare fest. This did not prove to be the case at all and I was very pleased to see it. Bateman, Hall, and Edgerton prove to be excellent in their performances and while you, hopefully, wont be able to relate to some of the character choices that happen, it feels very real and this definitely comes down to the three main stars putting on such a great performance. The writing also adds to this. It never feels like these situations couldn't happen in real life or that it is forced just for the sake of moving the plot along. Once the final shot faded to black my friend and I did something we usually never do. We had to sit in our seats for a few moments and collect ourselves before getting up and leaving the theatre. While the ending left many questions, it created a conversation that I had with said friend about what was the true answer to what happened. The story, the acting, and the writing all blended together to create an excellent film that resulted in me having a strong emotional response once the credits were rolling, which usually doesn't happen.""The Gift"" definitely lived up to the hype that I had created for myself, which is rare, and I will be sure to look out for anything that Edgerton is directing in the future because of his potential as a future director.",The Gift
282,dhxmansarbajna,The Movie will leave you in awe.,8,1 November 2015,"From around fifteen minutes into 'The Gift', you begin to understand that it is not another thriller. The principle characters are way too less, the setting is confines to one house characterized by only too many glass doors and Joel Edgerton never appears too creepy as to scare you out. Then for a brief moment, you might wonder ""Is this movie going to be as good as I expect it to be?"" And this is where The Gift succeeds. In overwhelming your expectations, by doing everything a cult thriller does. Taking a non complicated story and converting it into a gripping suspenseful plot. Joel Edgerton successfully masters the craft of creating a thriller. ""The Gift"" is also backed by tremendous performances by Joel, Jason Bateman and Rebecca hall; with special mention going to Rebecca. I really loved her. I won't dive into any aspect of the story as it would spoil the purpose of the movie. You need to watch it quietly, alone with a clean slated mind. You will definitely be awed in its brilliance. I personally feel ""The Gift"" is one of the best thriller movies in the recent times and has all potential to become a cult classic in the near future.

283,robertka1,Very frustrating and aggravating movie ***Spoilers***,1,31 October 2015,"I do not know if I hated Bateman in this movie because I much prefer him in a comedic role or simply because of his role in this production.First of all, after 2 or 3 evenings together with food and wine, most people more or less know some things about their guests. You would think that Jason, deeply involved in security, would have developed some sense of security for himself and his family; but No. Were they all drinking so much and enjoying each other's company that nothing about themselves was discussed? I find that extremely strange. Normally, when you meet someone from your past, obviously one of the first questions is normally something like ""What have you been doing"" or such. Here, Gordo said that he had a short stint with the Armed Forces and that's it. They have not seen each other for 20 years and obviously, he couldn't have been with the Armed Forces that long so the next question would have been about the rest of the time. Think about it a little: spend 2 or 3 evenings together with your wife and a friend you have not seen in 20 years. The vast, vast majority of people meeting people with whom they were in school MUST REMEMBER SOMETHING from that time. Were they all that shallow that no one speaks of the past?? Secondly, Robyn invites Gordo in their house the first time. That is normal courtesy. But then, he comes again and again. She's alone and nervous; yet, she lets him in!! Where do you see people inviting those that make them nervous and edgy into their house when they are alone? Is she that much of a bobo head that she cannot come up with an excuse to close the door? Thirdly, when they are invited to Gordo's ""house"", they behave like children: Simon's obscene gestures and their going through drawers even though Gordo could see them from outside and he said he was being absent ""for a couple of minutes""!!Fourthly, how can Gordo kidnap their dog? People moving to a new place don't let their dog run loose because he is not yet familiar with the area and can easily get lost.My wife and I walked out swearing before the end of the performance. Some people here gave this thing a 6 or a 7 rating: what were they smoking?",The Gift

One thing I liked is that it started building the suspense pretty quickly and kept up the momentum so that I was engrossed the whole time. Another thing I liked is that this movie had a serious creep factor, made all the creepier because of its subtlety. I loved how Edgerton played Gordo with understated menace. I also loved the way the plot shifted so effortlessly so that I was never entirely sure what was going on or whose perspective to trust. There were some ""what the heck?"" moments for sure, but they were never contrived or convoluted. Finally, I liked that the movie had something to say but let its message play out in the drama which had far more emotional punch.

He has joined a long list of directors who has starred in their own films. And he chooses to go the dark route-flirting with the horror genre, but never succumbs to gore and blood splatter. The scenes he shares with his co-stars: Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall are the most uncomfortable, due to the weird awkwardness that comes with the personality he imbibes with the role.The gifts, which his character gives to the couple, are quite harmless, but it is used appropriately as a plot device and an action prompter into the next scenes. Moreover, the dark nature is aided by a never ending display of literally shadowy figures- blackness within the benighted confines of the film. Overall, it works better as a moral lesson than its intended genre: thriller --- - cutting through marital issues and revenge as major plot points.",The Gift

This looked like a Lifetime straight to TV movie when I saw the trailer and I won't lie that is what attracted me because good thrillers do come along but you gotta wait for them sometimes. What I liked most about this movie is that it portrayed it'self as a low budget small studio film but while your are watching it you can clearly see it's not a crappy low budget film at all even though you may not see many fireworks. The director does a good of trying to get inside your head for the entire movie to the point where you just have to piece everything you watched together before you can determine of the film you are watching is even interesting. It seems the director easily keeps your focus with movie by making your brain piece clues together to figure out what, where and why things are happening. Great acting and great directing made this a 10 out of 10 for me.

288,invernessmovieclub,Return to form for the psychological thriller!,7,31 August 2015,"Over the last few years the thriller genre has been somewhat neglected. There are, of course movies that get tagged as a thriller but they rarely leave you with that sense of fear and vulnerability as well as the tension and, well, thrills that this genre demands. Aussie actor Joel Edgerton has quietly been making a name for himself over the last decade with a run of strong and versatile performances. He can now add another string to his bow as the director of The Gift, a psychological thriller that will keep you biting your nails and leave you guessing how it's all going to end.The Gift centres around Simon (Jason Bateman) and his wife Robyn (Rebecca Hall) as they move from Chicago to Los Angeles so Simon can begin employment at a new Security firm and to possibly escape a few personal issues they've had. Whilst shopping for furniture for their new home, they meet Gordo (Joel Edgerton) who went to school with Simon years before. Everything seems pleasant enough initially as Gordo accepts a meal invitation and returns the favour by leaving them a few innocent gifts. But as the movie develops Simon takes exception to Gordo randomly appearing at the house and eventually asks him to leave the couple alone. Is Gordo really as innocent as he seems? Or could Simon be hiding something in the past that he doesn't want Gordo to reveal?It would be impossible to expand further on the plot without giving too much away but the slow build and reveals leave you hanging on to see what the next act brings.The three leads are all excellent. Jason Bateman is giving the chance to play a little against type from his usual nice guy to the nastier aspects of Simon's nature. Rebecca Hall is also on top form as the vulnerable Robyn where you never know if her personal issues are causing her to overreact or whether she really is in danger at times. The movie though belongs to Edgerton who brings both sides of emotion to Gordo as making the audience feel threatened and also sorry for him.There is no real action as the budget was less than $5m. It is simply a decent story based on the characterisation of the three actors and the claustrophobic edge that Edgerton brings to the direction. The Gift is by no means perfect and there are certain scenes that feel overlong at times. The plot itself also isn't anything we haven't seen before but The Gift is a more than satisfying thriller that will leave you gripped to the final scene and will make you think twice about reuniting with old acquaintances from the past.",The Gift

Like, REALLY really!",8,21 November 2015,"From thequickflickcritic.blogspot.com/ The sins of the past return, demanding ruthless retribution in the dark thriller ""The Gift"". Multi-gifted Aussie Joel Edgerton writes, directs and stars as a sad sack loser who will not let go of the atrocities done unto him decades ago in high school. And the upwardly mobile yet troubled couple played by Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall are set square in his vengeful crosshairs.Edgerton is masterful as he infuses virtually every single scene in his extraordinary film with urgent potency, while consistently propelling the story along at a vigorously unnerving pace. See if you agree that it puts one in the mind of another ominously harrowing flick with which you may be familiar, the 1987 domestic terror classic ""Fatal Attraction"". Granted, Edgerton's character may not be as frantically psychotic as the whacked out woman scorned whom the great Glenn Close tormented us (and poor Michael Douglas) with in that one.But he is every bit as frightening.For more of my Movie Reviews categorized by Genre please visit: thequickflickcritic.blogspot.com/",The Gift
290,tody711,Love this movie... Have seen it many times,9,5 August 2021,From the first time I saw this I loved it. It has so much 'meaning'... Joel Edgerton is great. I always wanted to write him a fan letter but didn't... Don't miss this one. You will never forget it... Trust me.... I should hve given it a 10.. As they say ... you may be done with the past... but is the past done with you...,The Gift
291,lizaio1,"""Gordo the Weirdo"" is My Kind of Leading Man",9,7 March 2018,"When you first start watching this film, you think that Simon is the leading man and Robyn is his leading lady and la de da they move back to Simon's hometown and this guy they run into, ""Gordo the Weirdo"" is your potential antagonist. And, depending on how you react to the events that occur throughout the course of the movie, you might still think that.I think this film does a great job of flipping traditional hero/anti-hero ideas and typical protagonist/antagonist roles. Joel Edgerton is a gem. I'd seen him in other things (The Great Gatsby, Star Wars Episodes II and III, Kinky Boots) but this role, and knowing that he wrote and directed, as well as starred, knocked my socks off. I'm glad he made this film, and I think it is extremely well done. If you like slow burn psychological thrillers with a whole lot of tension and cringey moments, this is a must-see.",The Gift
292,jleon25,Enticing but predictable,4,28 March 2018,"Ok, yea it kept me interested. but starting off, the way the guy introduced himself to the couple should have raised a flag to her husband. If he did what he did to the guy, he would have remembered it and put a stop to his intrusions immediately. Just a few more issues that makes it unbelievable and outrageous. First. The guy shows up at the house the 1st time un-invited while her husband is at work. With her husband knowing the past between them, he should have addressed it immediately. When he shows up the second time, while he is at work, the ditzy wife should have put a stop to it instead of inviting him in again. Only a pollyanna would have considered him safe at this point. Well, it it was me, at this point, I would have confronted him for sure.Second, after all the conformations and both of them being aware that he has been getting in their house when they are not home, at least change the locks. The seem to be well off. They seem to have an alarm system that isn't working so well . Get it fixed, replaced, hire private security.By the time she passed out drinking the water she got from her fridge, and given how her husband had bullied him, it was all downhill and predictable. As for leaving us up in the air by not knowing if the new born father was the husband, Simon or Gordo, well this must have been written before we had DNA testing. A quick DNA test would determine who the father is, add in the video he got from Gordon in bed with his wife passed out, even with his monkey mask. Given the video and DNA test. If it was Gordo's kid, a prosecutor just out of law school would easily convict him.Sorry, it didn't impress me with the idiotic actions of the characters and it's easily predictability.One other possible ending is, Gordo told her it was his baby. Look at her face when Simon run's back in the hospital and sees his wife, in the nursery, about to start to breast feed her baby. She accepted, it since she had a soft spot in her, for Gordo from day one, even if he did rape her. She wanted a kid, and it was obviously, she no longer wanted to be with her bully husband, let alone a kid with him. So, when she is told it is not Simon's kid, she was content. Gordo did fake the injured arm when he tossed the arm sling away. Maybe that extra sympathy was enough to give him a pass on raping her. To me, this is the more probable ending. Again, given her look, as she is about to breast feed her baby, she accepted it, I think Gordo gets away with the rape. After all, she did allow him to come in her home, un-invited and without her husband present in more than one occasion. Proof enough to tell me she like him more than her husband, especially after she uncovered his past and how he got his promotion.",The Gift
293,abraxis0,Ultimately it's crap...don't believe the hype,3,10 October 2015,"he's an up-and-coming dude just starting to make his wealth, she's a pretty hot lady and sticks by his side. Everything is going really really well until a face from his past reappears. And that face has had it pretty rough. But why? And does he want revenge?That's it. That's the entire set up for the entire plot of this movie. It never gets any deeper than that. Once you figure out the weirdo wants revenge, and this is not a spoiler because it's super obvious from the beginning, nothing much really interesting happens after that. It's extremely predictable although I'm not going to give away the details why. Trust me when I tell you if you were thinking of downloading a porno while looking at this film then go for the porno. The ending will be just a surprising and shocking provided you've never seen a porno. The ending to any porno is more satisfying than the ending of this film... Or its beginning and middle for that matter. It's crap.",The Gift
294,andreolimarco,Outstanding debut,8,23 August 2017,"The Gift is a psychological thriller of rare efficacy and beauty in these times. It is Joel Edgerton's debut as director who also carves out the role of the villain and his role is surely the most impressive, better played and also better written (by Edgerton himself).Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall also do a good job, but the Australian actor (and director/writer) steals the scene, even though he isn't the main protagonist.About the ending, I like it. I've read someone criticizing the fact that you don't understand who is the real father of the baby. But I think that the last 10 minutes are perfect as they are. Edgerton's performance is outstanding: he really acts like a fool, with a frightening gaze.One of the best thriller films of the last years. Deserves more than a viewing.",The Gift
295,CatastropheCatCat,Predictable and slow,6,21 September 2017,"What I found good in this movie was the acting part. The movie was well played, especially the acting of Gordon was very good. The story is also interesting, and apart from clichés. As the movie goes on, it keeps the audience wondering about what is the truth to the story. Although it kept me watching with curiosity, I was kind of bored because of its slow progress. The ending was not that surprising as I expected that it would be. The cinematography was also quite good, as being one of the things that kept me watching.After all, I am not very glad to see this movie, but I also do not regret it because of the interesting story.",The Gift

297,dewpic,Has anyone heard of a DNA test? Bizarre plot twist!!,2,7 July 2021,OK this movie was doing just fine till the climax hit. It is so bizarre and easily disputed that a student of science & logic might puke after watching. And why would send a tape with incriminating evidence to the other guy? Makes no sense. All law officers should watch this movie and have a laugh.,The Gift
298,jamamaes,"Shocking reality, always think before you act",8,7 October 2015,"After finally getting the chance to watch this film, I thoroughly enjoyed it. It is not just shocking when watching it with how the story unfolds. It is shocking how relevant to reality it can be with the great message of thinking back to people you have wronged and what to do in the future. I really enjoyed this film and its message. A film that makes you think more about your own life and bridges that gap in this psychological way are great films. Of course it has to be done right which I believe Joel Edgerton in directing writing and staring in did very well. Would look forward to his next film(s) after this. The cast performed very well with great acting from Jason Bateman moving away from comedy, Joel Edgerton who you both felt sorry for and hated at different intervals of the movie. Nothing too special with cinematography but nothing looked out of place and the setting made the film feel that much bit like reality. However I did feel at certain points the back story of Joel Edgerton's character could of been looked at in a bit more detail as his past was the key point to the movie. So this could have been flushed out a bit more to make the ending that much more impacting. But other than this I very much enjoyed the movie and would recommend anyone to watch it if you are bored of the same formulaic movie and want a more psychological mystery that makes you think more in- depth. 8/10",The Gift
299,K_ash10,A Thriller That's Worth Your Time,10,20 November 2015,"I unfortunately didn't get to see this in theaters so I had to wait for the DVD. But that's okay because it was worth the wait. This movie about a man who is basically stalking a married couple and invading their lives which causes conflict. Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall did great in this film. And the standout was Joel Edgerton, who in fact wrote and directed the film. His performance as well as his writing and directing were fantastic. It's a well paced, well made thriller that really will surprise you and keep you guessing. It's not a very predictable film. Certain plot points leave wondering if mistakes from the past can really have a harsh effect on people. It doesn't seem like something to think about while watching a movie but this film paints a good picture of why you shouldn't bully people.",The Gift
300,furtherdownfilms,A thriller that takes its time. In a good way.,7,7 September 2015,"The Gift (2015) – 7 out of 10 A Movie Review by Nathan FischerThe Gift is a great example of a slow burn. This movie takes its time and is intended for viewers with patience. The trick with movies like this though, is that the ending better pay off, or your audience will feel as though the film has wasted their time. So did The Gift waste my time? The short answerNo. I'm not going to dive heavy in to the plot because it's best not to know much about it. This is a personal story, and if I try to sum it up in too many details, it won't sound appealing. In a nutshell, a married couple named Simon (Jason Bateman) and Robyn (Rebecca Hall) move from Chicago to California for Simons new job. Simon is originally from the area and ends up running in to an old high school classmate, Gordo (Joel Edgerton). After that, an off and ominous relationship form between the three characters. That's all I'm going to say about the plot. There are a few genre styles going on here. It's not quite a horror movie, although it does have some horror elements. It's mostly a suspense thriller that tries to keep you guessing. I say ""tries"" because it really does try. It respects the audience's intelligence, and it definitely takes its timeperhaps a little too much. But that's what stood out to me about The Gift. Right when I needed it to pick up or take a turn, it did. The pacing may seem slow to some, but I was never bored.It must be noted that this is Joel Edgerton's writing/directorial debut. Like most actors turned directors, he has an eye to create a scene. He approaches it with grace over style. To me, that's a smart move. The shots he chooses are safe, tastefully done and well composed. His writing feels natural and the characters, for the most part, react to their situations in a grounded and realistic way. There is so much deceit and lying going on in the film, and that is where the acting shines. Jason Bateman steals the show. He normally plays the sarcastic, quick witted funny guy. Not in this movie. Charming, maybe, but not funny. And Joel Edgerton feels at home in his role as well, keeping it simple. It's really hard to know whom to trust between the two of them. That is where the movie works. Actress Rebecca Hall stands right in the center of the drama. I felt for her character but there were a couple moments where I thought to myself, ""That is clearly a bad idea"". The Gift is a solid first film for Joel Edgerton. I look forward to him really spreading his wings as a filmmaker. He went small and safe with this movie, as any new director probably should. Aside from some pacing issues and an adequate, if not underwhelming ending, The Gift is a thriller worth your time.",The Gift
301,Jaspa1982,More like this please Hollywood!,8,7 February 2019,"This is one of those drama/thrillers that Hollywood does so well when it puts its mind to it. Smart, gripping, great characters surrounded by an interesting and sometimes exciting story. The twists that happen throughout feel real thanks to tight writing which ties in the events of the story to the characters lives both present and historical. Everything just fits and leaves the viewer wanting to see what happens next. The film really belongs to Joel Edgerton who writes, directs and acts. His portrayal of a character with lots going on inside and out is pitch perfect. More like this please Hollywood!",The Gift
302,info-15-396609,Joel Edgerton triangulates with a masterpiece.,10,30 October 2015,"No spoilers here! The screenplay, the direction, and one of the lead roles— all by Joel Edgerton. This is one of the most important, and brilliant films I have seen on an all too accepted, yet unacceptable scenario. This film should be used as a teaching aid wherever psychology and psychiatry are studied, as well as in every major film school. Entertaining, thrilling and enlightening. The acting performances and character depictions are stunning, the detail of which is staggering. The writing is flawless, and the direction, impeccable. I would definitely say Mr. Edgerton wanted deeply to tell us something— And he has— in abundance. I hope you all thoroughly enjoy The Gift. Can't wait for his next work.",The Gift
303,hepodcast,"Not quite horror, but very strong",8,4 December 2015,"The Gift isn't strictly speaking a horror movie, but it is a movie about ghosts. No, not the translucent specters of the dead, but the ghosts we live with every day, the echoes of our decisions, both good and bad, and how they affect us years later, change our lives, define our identities.The story begins with Simon, a well-to-do lawyer running across Gordo, an old acquaintance of his in a chance encounter after moving to a new town. Gordo starts stopping by Simon's house unannounced, dropping off little gifts, chatting with his wife, Robyn. There's nothing inherently menacing about any of these gestures, but Simon begins to suspect that there's something just a little off about Gordo. Robyn believes Gordo is just trying to make friends, but Simon insists that something is wrong.To delve further into the specifics of the plot would risk spoiling a deftly plotted mystery. This is a film that is best seen with as little information as possible, partly because the very genius of the story is how it plays on the audience's ingrained preconceptions. The element of mystery isn't just a gimmick leading up to a cheap twist. It's a tool that's used in the indictment of the viewer, a device that forces us to consider how we choose who to trust and who to dislike. The film doesn't just present a skewed perspective, it makes us complicit in accepting that perspective.The Gift is reminder that the past isn't a thing that simply disappears. The things we have done come back to haunt us when we least expect it, and though we might change how we look and where we live, the core of who we are often remains unchanged, for better or worse.From a technical perspective, The Gift is yet another example of why Blumhouse is such a powerful presence in the world of genre horror today. There's nothing too showy or ""big budget"" happening here, but the impressive filmmaking craftsmanship on display serves the story perfectly, and the lead actors all bring incredible nuance and subtlety to their characters.The Gift is a thriller and a mystery, but it's also a character piece. It's a lesson about how difficult it is to truly know someone, how difficult it is even to know ourselves. It draws us in and then makes us think, and it holds up a mirror to our souls.For more reviews like this check out HumanEchoes.com",The Gift
304,andrewimcdiarmid,You thought you had it figured out,8,21 April 2021,"I've just finished watching this and I still can't decide who the bad guy is.When it starts, you think you've got it dialed. Gordo is the awkward weird ex-classmate who will be the stalker and Simon is the successful one who is nice enough but doesn't want to reconnect. His wife Robyn and him will do their best to avoid Gordo but it eventually become something where the house burns down while the antagonist is dragged off in hand cuffs while the couple thanks their lucky stars they can now move on.Not the case!Edgerton is a smart and savvy actor and apparently also director, if this film is any indication.One sign of a flimsy film is when it starts using too many cheats to tie the story together because it lacked in writing. Not here. Gordo continues to be awkward and weird but never goes too far over the top that it is beyond believable. You also realize that Bateman's character Simon is a real piece of work, and the film doesn't try and polish him up to look less like trash at the end so ends can be tied up, which is refreshing.No character is beyond suspicion, and none are absolved of wrongdoing either. You feel for Gordo while simultaneously resenting him, and despise Simon more and more even though you wish he'd win at the same time as think he just might end up being the worst of them all. Robyn never becomes parody. She acts as you'd expect a real person in her spot to, not going overboard to try and add to the edginess or drama.As mentioned in other reviews, well paced. Doesn't try and rush through certain parts to embellish others.Definitely worth seeing. Not your average suspense thriller!",The Gift
305,MDavenp900,"Sorry to say ""flawed""",5,12 August 2016,"Please do not read this until after you have watched the movie. I do not want to be responsible for affecting anyone's enjoyment.Bottom line? I agree with parts of many reviews. Bateman and Edgerton put on excellent performances. Hall does not have the same opportunities due to the script, but still is convincing and enjoyable to watch. Direction, camera work, soundtrack, suspense up to the final moments, all for me were outstanding. Then the unfortunate.The idea that ""Robyn"" would get pregnant precisely at the time of ""Gordo's"" entrance into the house is just too far fetched. Now, if he was only responding to the things ""Simon"" said, the suggestion that Gordo wanted to ""nail her,"" and the pregnancy was a timely bonus? One line of dialogue could have explained that instead of leaving us feeling silly having to believe the improbable.Then the issue of DNA, as we all know, would have resolved the ""Did he or didn't he?"" very easily. If he didn't, the issue is over. If he did, he spends most of the rest of his life in prison. Not exactly ""getting even.""Last, I really expected to find out that Gordo was the one to send the emails, making it look like Simon had cheated to get the job. That would have been in line with the entire premise and made him far more devious and diabolical. Not writing that into the script (or including it in the final cut if it was in the script) was yet one more let down for me.So, absolutely exciting to watch for 100 minutes, an abject failure after that. Not sure why I see so few tight scripts anymore, but Edgerton could have scored big in all three areas (writing, directing and acting) with a little more thought.",The Gift
306,jryndon,"A suiting title, since it was a delightful surprise",7,9 October 2015,"Wow, it's been a long time. I was taken off guard and jumped. You know when those types in horror movies where there is silence and you know, 100 percent, that something's going out of the corner to surprise you? Well, only in rare cases do i get surprised since when you are expecting it, then it'd be a challenge for horror writers/directors, but this one sure got me. It was very effective because I didn't expect it, and there was a subtlety in it. You thought there is nothing, just some story with scenarios a league away from horror scenes, but you'd kind of get the sense that it's going that way.Not only is it surprises you to the point you'd jump out of your skin/sit, as in my case, this movie has some life lesson in it. I mean, mean people get what they deserve, one way or another, they'd get it. And if you do learn things as you grow up, then it is undeserving for you to receive retribution, unless, you don't and you're just the same prick you always were, but only with a grown up body, minus the naivete of a kid.One thing I like about it among many things is that from the start, to finish, you'd change were to root for, and in the end, it'd be a debate with your friends, families or whoever watched it. Is this deserving to what happen to him in the end, Is what he did the right thing? And I can see it. Many would have a varying opinion in the end.Kudos to the creators, and actors and everyone that created this good thriller. Never thought I'd still have this effect on a movie of this kind. As a last note, this one got the investigating type and as clues leads to some more, things became to unravel, curtains began to raise to show the ugly, naked truth.An eye for an eye, and in today's society, would you consider this kind of redemption if you were in a position this one's unfortunate circumstances?",The Gift

309,arrfan30,"Never let bygones be bygones, says ""The Gift""",8,6 November 2015,"""The Gift"", can be considered as a new perspective by which thrillers are portrayed. Joel Edgerton, though he has acted in some big budget films and been directed by Ridley Scott, does not strike as a great actor but as as Writer/Director one should definitely agree that he has done a GREAT job in this film. All credit for this film goes to this one person only. On the acting front, Jason who seems to be choosing more dramatic roles recently has done a very neat job in portraying his role as ""seems like a good guy"". Rebecca Hall has done a better job compared to Jason in this film as she has more vital points in the movie. Joel has outdone himself with simplicity, simple yet powerful acting on his part.Joel did take everyone by storm in this film by showcasing his fine practice of directing. Every scenes in this movie makes us think that this is just another thriller but defies everything at the end. The way the characters are portrayed has to be definitely appreciated as the depth of the characters gets unfold as the film goes by which makes it more interesting and highly gripping. The second half deserves more appreciation than the first half because Joel is busy making people believe that it's just another usual thriller but 'Simon says' ""No"". The intensity of Joel's characters in this film is still a mystery, he has played it so well that you couldn't believe the climax. Bottomline is that this film will give you the chills and will leave you hanging making the viewers asking for more.",The Gift

Going into a movie with high expectations on most occasions is a bad thing. While during the first fifteen minutes of the film i wasn't so sure, it definitely had me hook, line and sinker by the middle right up until the shocking end. Now don't expect a huge plot twist but it was definitely creepy and ended the film with a really horrible vibe which worked because of the style of film it is. I found the characters to be very interesting and it was interesting who you sided with as the story played out. Joel Edgerton directed and wrote The Gift and certainly achieved in providing thrills, shocks and plot twists. Really enjoyable ride... or not so enjoyable in certain parts but it made for a great thriller.

312,juliemaniglia,There are no thrills...,5,9 August 2015,"The Gift is billed as a ""thriller"" but it was not very thrilling. It's a rather slow-moving drama if it's anything.A married couple runs into a former classmate of the husband. The husband claims not to remember this classmate at all, but they invite the classmate to dinner at their house. Then he keeps dropping by the house, usually when the husband is at work, bringing small gifts.After accepting an invitation to the classmate's house (reluctantly..at least on the husband's part), the evening does not go well and the husband tells the classmate to get lost and not to bother them anymore. A few weird things happen after that.As time goes by, circumstances work to reveal that the husband was actually not a very nice person in his school years and is still not very nice in the present. It seemed a little far-fetched that his wife would not have a clue, prior to meeting this classmate, what her husband's character was like.At any rate, it held my interest until the end of the movie, but it could have probably been shorter. It was okay, but nothing to jump up and down about. Reminded me of a Lifetime Channel flick. Meh.",The Gift
313,MovieHeartGirl,Great movie--how did I never hear of it?! NO SPOILERS,8,23 December 2016,"So well done! I think that the excellent acting of Rebecca Hall and Jason Bateman (along with the rest of the cast), and the fine production values/look/mood of the film elevated a plot that has commonalities with many other thrillers (though, I should say, it definitely had its own unique and surprising touches)and elevated it tremendously. I was supposed to be multi-tasking while I watched, but I couldn't take my eyes off of this film! I don't want to say much more to avoid spoilers. Highly entertaining and riveting. Good message, too.SIDE NOTE: How did I miss this movie? Probably due to the title. I wish that filmmakers would make an effort to NOT to use the exact same titles as other popular films made in the past 10-20 years (or ever!). How hard would it be to come up with a different title?

The Gift is expertly plotted and executed by director and lead actor Joel Edgerton. Can't wait to see what he directs in the future in this vein. Jason Bateman's best performance in a feature I've seen. Joel Edgerton as always delivers a perfect performance that intentionally unnerves you and really makes you question his character and motives throughout.

The suspense and waiting for the full story to reveal itself is just so powerful.I found myself shouting at my tv begging to know the true tale of events this film is based around.

321,bartlettjon,"""The Gift"" (2015)",8,12 September 2015,"This film ranks as the number one unnoticed film for Summer 2015. It is a thoughtful and carefully crafted mystery by Aussie Joel Edgerton who wrote, directed, produced and (whew!) acted in this film. The film begins with the arrival in L.A. of a young professional couple from the Chicago area which brings the husband played by Jason Bateman, back to his home city where there is a past waiting to confront him. The wife, played by Rebecca Hall, assumes the role of unraveling the secrets of the past. An old friend from high school (played by Joel Edgerton) bumps into them shopping and what initially seems to be a friendly and cordial reunion spins way out of control. The character development is slow and methodical but very calculated to support the conclusion. American audiences may think about getting some more popcorn at this point. Nothing gets blown up. There is no chase scene. San Francisco does not get swallowed up in a giant tidal wave, but things sure do get tense ala Hitchcock. What makes this picture special is the originality of the plot and message. Reality becomes non-reality (Heart of Darkness- Conrad). The wife may be viewed as a metaphor for the Valkyries where women choose which warrior may live and who shall die. There is a swipe at the corporate world and the definition of ""success."" But most compelling is the concept of revenge. These themes leave the viewer with a lot to think about long after leaving the theatre. Casting, acting, sets, photography were all superb. Mr. Edgerton deserves special mention for such a film and to convey these thoughts. If this is a view of what is to follow keep it coming, man.",The Gift
322,JohnB_2016,You'll Never want to be Alone at Night Again,9,18 February 2016,"This movie was one of the best thrillers that I have seen in a long time. And I mean it's been a while. While there were some other great movies recently that riddled me with suspense, none kept me questioning ""what is going to happen next?"" like this one. As a directorial debut from Edgerton, this film did fantastic for his first feature film. The movie rocked me to my core. The story was laid out perfectly, in a slow, and heart-racing manner. Although not listed in the horror genre, the film also contains some of the best jumpscares in a movie.Edgerton, being the director, created an amazing, and slightly terrifying, character for this film. Mosley is that creeper that you WANT to stay away from. And Edgerton played it in the best way possible.Rebecca Hall gave a heartfelt performance. Her character was strong- willed, courageous, and kind to Gordon, even with his stalking nature. Her willingness to dig deep into her husband's past is really what brings the whole story together. She goes against the ""freaking wife"" cliché. Bateman's character was decent but not his best. Simon is deceptive, and hard core, and is willing to do his worst to get what he wants; creating the profile of the perfect swindler. Although for some unsolved plot holes, the movie will fascinate you beyond belief.",The Gift
323,keelygirl2,"I loved it...a little Hitchcock meets ""She-Devil""",9,18 October 2015,"I keep reading reviewers' quotes about bygones. The more appropriate quote for this trio, as quoted from Gordo: ""You may be done with the past...but the past isn't done with you"". As someone who is in the same age bracket as the actors, with a family, I can say that this movie is a lot scarier than most of the ridiculous and far fetched pulp produced in recent years.SPOILER: the wife knows something is off and not just because Gordo may have a few loose screws. When I left the theater, I kept thinking of a movie that I saw years ago with Roseanne Barr called ""She-Devil"". In that movie, Roseanne goes from frumpy housewife / mom -who has lost everything- to a bit of a success story. Along the way, she manages to pull herself out of a pit of despair. In doing so...she visits one kind of Hell after another on her previous tormentor. The Gift left me thinking about the characters for hours afterward. LOVED IT",The Gift
324,cameron-59-297793,Best Psychological Thriller I've seen!!,10,8 August 2015,"The Gift is an outstanding psychological thriller directed by first time director, Joel Edgerton! It tells the story of a Man and his wife move back to Los Angeles and run into a high school classmate, who mysteriously gives them gifts at their front door. By doing this, memories from the past are brought up to ruin many things about their marriage! This is by far the best psychological thriller I have ever seen! Not only did Edgerton direct this film, but he wrote and starred in it! His performance was a masterpiece. But the best performance in my opinion is Jason Bateman! Transferring from a comedy actor into a serious role is hard but he pulled it off. This movie gets you thinking after the credits role thinking about how words from the past can really hurt and damage people! This movie was perfect in my opinion and I will be disappointed if it is not nominated for multiple Oscars especially for best director! A flawless movie! EASY 10 stars and much watch!",The Gift
325,Skiis4Life,This is not a first date or even a second date movie,7,16 November 2015,"The movie starts slow with typical character development. You think that Simon and Gordo were just acquaintances in high school... but eventually you learn the truth. Didn't see that coming as Simon, really the writer, keep that from us for most of the movie. Gordo for his part wasn't all that normal either. The house scene with the dinner, the notes (very creepy), and the mind-f**k at the end with the monkey mask all played into something that I can't believe would ever really happen.And that's why this movie works. It sucks you into the paranoia of Simon, Gordo, and Robyn. They all have secrets and issues that they hide and they're all on their own plot lines.Overall it's a very suspenseful movie but it does start slow. And it leaves you to wonder, ""what happens now?"" And if you do watch this movie with a significant other don't be surprised if they're looking at you and wondering if you're a bully...What are you hiding? R",The Gift
326,GavinHeisenberg,The Most Must See Movie of the Summer,9,13 August 2015,"""The Gift"" is the most must see movie of the summer. It is such a compelling thriller from start to finish. Just when you think you know where it's going it throws in a twist you won't see coming. Hat's off to Joel Edgerton, Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall, who all give great and very subtle performances. All 3 leads are multilayered and engaging. Edgerton is great as a sweet but social awkward loner. Bateman plays a smug condescending douche to a T and Rebecca Hall was very likable. It's nice to see her in a great movie again. It's disturbing, gripping and thought provoking. It has the best ending to a movie I have seen all year long. It is this year's ""Nightcrawler"". In terms of plot and execution I would say that this and ""Inside Out"" are easily the best movies of the Summer. Along with this ""Unfriended"" and ""It Follows"". it has been a damn good year for Thrillers. Rush out to see it. A Film that has to be seen with an audience 8.6/10",The Gift
327,picturebigger,Gifted actors - The Gift that keeps on giving,8,28 November 2015,"Good to see Jason Bateman showing his versatility as an actor. Of course he does funny roles brilliantly and never fails to make me laugh, but he does serious roles really well too. It must be hard for most actors to pull off a serious role when they are mainly known/typecast for comedy. Interestingly I find Bateman does this convincingly by not really changing much about how he comes across on screen, but more by removing the comic element of his usual high standard performance. I don't find it hard to take him seriously because it feels like its still him, but in a bad situation -if that makes any sense? Perhaps he would say that's a load of old tosh but either way how I interpret how he goes about his performance is irrelevant as long as the end result is good - which I assure you it won't disappoint. Having now seen this and Disconnect I want to see more of him in roles like this as he is very believable and that's the part that sets big actors like him aside from the rest. But The Gift doesn't just offer us Bateman it also gives us Rebecca Hall who is definitely making her mark recently. I have seen her in Transcendence and Closed Circuit and I find her fascinating to watch, she's different from many a female lead and I think and hope we will be seeing a lot more of her in the future. Joel Edgerton of course handled his part with ease, he was creepy and sinister but just enough to be disturbing without making the mistake of overplaying the part. Mind you having been in massive productions like the Great Gatsby with DiCaprio this is all probably just a walk in the park for him. You may ask who am I to be giving reviews on actors like these? Well I am merely a film buff who has seen literally hundreds of films and when a good one comes along with a great cast and an ending you literally couldn't predict, I think it is only fair and right to give it the praise it deserves.",The Gift
328,visharl,something familiar but never feeling tied down by the clichés,8,10 March 2016,"Films that provide a fresh twist on them are few and far between.The Gift may initially feel like it's something we've all seen before, but it builds to a tremendous crescendo. This is a dark and twisted gem of a thriller with a gut-punch of an ending.Actor Joel Edgerton has also written this thriller and brings us something familiar but never feeling tied down by the clichés which it uses to its benefit.Simon (Jason Bateman) and wife Robyn (Rebecca Hall) have just moved into a new house. However their lives are thrown into uncertainty and chaos when Simon's old school pal Gordo (Edgerton) begins imposing himself on their life.As odd little gifts and gestures are presented to the couple, so are unspoken incidents from a distant past.Such a thriller will bring anything like Unlawful Entry to Single White Female to mind, although in this instance there is more of a male focus on the stalking.While Simon is immediately unsettled with Gordo's repeated turning up at their door unannounced, Robyn is more sympathetic to the loner. However, as her kindheartedness is dismissed by her husband as her just being soft, it soon becomes apparent that Gordo's presence is rooted in an incident from the past.To say any more about the premise would be to spoil one of the best thrillers to have been released this year.Some of the beats may feel familiar, but throughout there is a growing sense of unease. For much of the opening half there's a real off- kilter feel to what's going on. The escalation of Gordo's odd behaviour is handled well, squeezing out every ounce of tension out of the situation before flooring you with a sledgehammer of a final act.Bateman has yet again shown he's capable of performing dramatic roles with ease. He's brilliant as the cocky, ambitious Simon. His ability to be chameleon-like is impressive as he initially plays dumb to what's going on before things reach the unexpected climax.Hall plays Robyn note perfect. A woman recovering from a traumatic experience who wants to move on with her life, she's keen to see the good in people while ignoring any red flags that may be thrown into play.But the real star is Edgerton. As oddball Gordo, he's both unnerving and disarming. It's a special quality to possess in a role that's supposed to keep us guessing and he manages it with aplomb.Couple that with the overall tone and Edgerton's script and he becomes a film-maker worth keeping an eye on.The Gift may initially feel like it's something we've all seen before, but it builds to a tremendous crescendo. This is a dark and twisted gem of a thriller with a gut-punch of an ending.",The Gift
329,renezelwe,wasted opportunity,3,8 August 2015,"The colours, lighting, exteriors, interiors and jump scares were all good, but the action wasn't. A topless female is photographed twice from the back through frosted glass, and a female is barefoot in 4 brief appearances, 2 of a couple of seconds and 2 so brief they are barely noticeable. Did the actress(es) back off from all that or was it the Director? Unless thrillers have female flesh and violence as proper ingredients and not just fleeting glimpses they will not regularly put bums on seats. I have been an avid and regular cinemagoer since the early 1950s and have probably seen as many horrors and thrillers in their various versions as anyone, and I again have to use No One Lives, Maniac, Ex Machina, It Follows and 50 Shades Of Grey as recent examples of excellence.

Usually, directors in their own movies is a bad thing, but he's incredibly creepy.If you saw the previews and thought that this was just another stalker movie, it isn't. I was still putting it together when it ended. It's intelligent and it makes you think. It was compared to The Hand That Rocked the Cradle, Rosemary's Baby, and Cape Fear, and I thought that it couldn't possibly live up to all of that, but it did. It was creepy in a subtle way, but there were also jump scares that actually made people scream. There's little violence and no gore, but the tension is constant. Go see this movie!",The Gift
331,DoctorJackal,A Sleek and Effective Thriller,8,16 August 2015,"The Gift is a fairly simple film, yet it doesn't feel predictable. It tells the tale of a young married couple who move into a new home. They both seem innocent enough, but the past has come back to haunt them. We learn of a disturbing history and a compelling story of justice. The movie is immensely intriguing and doesn't feel conceited. Joel Edgerton hits it out of the park with an awesome performance, a competent script, and brilliant direction. Each scene is superbly shot and builds a lot of tension. Hallways are long and dimly lit, the pacing is steady, the score is ominous, and some stellar acting brings it all together. While I think Edgerton is the real star of the show, Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall also bring a lot to the screen. Their characters aren't flat and the chemistry between them feels organic. The confrontations they face, with each other and otherwise, are convincing. We feel connected, which is vital for making a good thriller.The plot is simple. There's a moral to the story, but the direction it takes doesn't feel too preachy. The ending is somewhat open for interpretation, but by the time the movie comes to a close, it wraps up nicely. It's straightforward and doesn't overstay its welcome. Movie fans of all kinds have something to enjoy here. In a swirling sea of disappointing summer schlock, this one stands out. Do yourself a favor and see this in theaters.",The Gift
332,taptoe-09046,The great gift is great performances,8,19 March 2018,"When I was reviewing film professionally, to me the great joy was watching brilliant actors bringing their characters to life on the screen. I had my favourites: Meryl Streep, Ellen Burstyn, Geraldine Page and, from left field, the Australian Wendy Hughes. And those magnificent males, Ben Kingsley, Brian Dennehy who were naturals like Spencer Tracy before them. I rarely see their quality anymore, due mainly to Hollywood's current obsession with superheroes, animation in all its forms, pyrotechnics and make-believe technology as a whole. But here's a gift, a genuine, realistic human drama, seamlessly directed by Joel Edgerton with the wonderfully talented Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall in sublime form. The great performances reveal an emotional range which, let's face it, are beyond Clint Eastwood, Nicholas Cage and Jennifer Lopez, with apologies to their fans. Bateman and Hall are perfectly cast; Edgerton's screenplay carries the edge in his name and the serpentine twists, and turns, kept me riveted throughout. The peripheral performances are likewise engaging. I note that the estimated budget is a mere five million. Really? Rarely has a gift given so much for so little. Highly recommended.",The Gift

Who knew Joel Edgerton was not only a good actor, but a good writer and director. I found each of the main characters to be interesting and believable. Especially liked Robyn and felt the movie was built around her and her kindness and innocence and vulnerability. Simon was a surprise and Gordo was both pathetic and inscrutable. Very fine film.I am a huge fan of Jason Bateman and felt he acted a very ""American Psycho""-like character, so perfectly living his privileged life. I loved Rebecca Hall, whom I have never seen before, and felt she was the most lovely and together character. Joel Edgerton is someone I only recognized from ""The Great Gatsby"" and yet I had to look him up on IMDb because I did not recognize him at all.

335,Arun145,One of the best films of 2015,9,9 August 2015,"The Gift is the story of a married couple (Jason Batemen and Rebecca Hall)who purchase a new home in California and come upon an old school'friend' of Batemen's in the form of 'Gordo' played by Director and Writer of the film Joel Edgerton, what follows is a 108 minute thrill ride filled with tension, an incredible amount of twists and some truly phenomenal acting. All three central performances are Oscar-worthy however the pick of the bunch is Jason Batemen as the married man with something to hide, he gives an astonishingly layered performance and shares fantastic chemistry with Hall. Full credit must be given to Joel Edgerton for his masterful directorial debut, he and cinematographer Eduard Grau utilise slow and controlled camera-work to give the film its tense feel, also Edgerton's choice of using music sparingly in the opening third and then adding more and more as the film builds to its incredible climax shows the mark of a fine director. The script is truly great and it offers a truly original idea that Hollywood hasn't really explored, whilst all of the twist and turns in the films storyline could cause a bloated feel, due to the well paced delivery it keeps the viewer enthralled to the very end. The Gift is a film that grips you from beginning to end and one of its greatest features is its opening, it spends little time setting up the scenario and throws the viewer straight in, an unconventional method proves a genius move and allows for atmosphere building tension to be built immediately. Needless to say The Gift is a film that demands watching by all and is hopefully the first of many directorial turns by Joel Edgerton.",The Gift

They meet Gordo the Weirdo, an old schoolmate of the husband.

Nor is it one of his formulaic millennial scary movies. It is written and directed by Joel Egerton, and a great first outing for him IMO.The Gift plays on the fear of the creepy ""stalker"", the loner. We all know one. But all is not so black and white. Complex characters, a dramatic storyline touching on school bullying, child abuse and homophobia leaves an audience more disturbed than scared. No over the top plot twists (that have only ever worked in exceptional circumstances like the Sixth Sense). No bloody scenes or grotesque violence. No teen nudity either. What has it to offer you ask?Go see it to find out!",The Gift
338,mattbowski,The Gift that keeps giving? Not quite,6,16 October 2015,I'll start by saying I really like the 3 main actors in the movie and think they give off good performances. This is a very different role for Bateman and one that I think he does well to play quite convincingly. His wife is brilliant and Joel Edgerton as Gordo the Weirdo is excellent. The slight issue with this movie is the premise is one very similar to that of many films and this movie doesn't really tread that far into new territory. Also while the story and acting is good I don't think the characters are built well enough for us to care that deeply about the outcome. The supposed bad guy isn't bad enough and the good guys aren't really good enough. There are some decent twists and turns but nothing jaw dropping. I did enjoy the film but as you can tell from my review I think it could have been so much more with a few changes to the script and a bit more suspense. However I do recommend you give it a try for yourself as the acting is great and it is still above average for a suspenseful thriller.,The Gift
339,kenzig-19275,"Not too good, not too bad. Has a good message.",6,27 May 2020,"I wanted to rate this 5.5/10 but you can't do half stars.I will say.. I LOVE LOVE LOVE Jason Bateman's acting, and his humor. There's no humor in this movie, though. I'm sure there's tons more people who know Jason from the show Ozark... but wow has he been in so many things. Basically has been acting his entire life. He's just very well rounded and I'll always watch something with him in it.Then there's Rebecca Hall who plays ""Robyn"".. I first saw her from the movie ""The Town"" (which is one of my favorite movies). The Town I'd rate a 10/10. So she's great, too.This movie, like I said in the title, isn't good nor bad. But it has a message at least. A message that I think is common sense, and even a message that could even be missed when watching it. But it's definitely a message that even if you're aware of, is good to be reminded of. Kind of a ""you never know what could happen"" or ""this could be you"" or ""you never know"".The message in my opinion, in simple terms is... ""Be Kind To Others"". It's as simple as that. Don't be a bully when you're younger cause you may regret it when you're older, LOL. You may be the cool kid in high school, but once everyone's older... it's an even playing field.I've always loved the motto ""Live And Let Live"", which actually has its own definition: ""You should tolerate the opinions and behavior of others so that they will similarly tolerate your own"". I couldn't believe this statement to be more true. You don't have to agree with others.. you don't have to even like others.. you could even absolutely despise someone... BUT JUST TREAT THEM WELL!!! Or keep your mouth closed and don't say anything at all, like our mommas used to tell us, LOL.Now onto the actual movie itself... it was definitely a fun ride I will say. One of the reasons I actually don't think it's a bad movie.. is because surprisingly you actually don't know what will happen next. Some movies no matter the genre you can kind of guess what will happen next... like subtle things. This movie you can't really. And is why this movie I think is also good. So it definitely is a cute little movie that I'm glad I've at least seen once.I'm someone that, if I like something? I'll watch it again in a year or something.. movies & tv shows. I like to end my reviews with mentioning if this is something I'd re-watch or not. I don't think anything too major happened that I'd forget about, for it to seem new again if I watched it in a year... it's definitely just a great one-time-see movie. But I'm glad I've seen it, and do appreciate the message I got from it/got reminded of again.",The Gift

Joel Edgerton does a great job as directing. To be honest I am not a huge fan of him, as I haven't seen him very much. However as directing and acting on this film he makes a great job. His best film probably is the Warrior with Tom Hardy. But as I said you will enjoy the film especially if you like thrillers. I don't want to bore you with long reviews.

It was a girls night out and a friend who had seen it gave it a thumbs up so we said, sure, why not. I would say it started slow for me but I do now understand why. You really have to get a feel for the main characters so you can almost understand and get a final feeling for them in the end. I had a bit of a difficult time with the choice of female lead in Rebecca Hall but I now understand I think she was wrestling with what she felt was an underlying suspicion or feeling she could not shake or understand. You will understand what I mean when you see it. I also ended up truly disliking Justin Bateman's character and made me wonder if this is what some of the people in the corporate world were like growing up and are like now. Heck, maybe even the Hollywood world. Dog eat dog, win at all cost. I really enjoyed this movie because it did have it's moments of ""oh my, what's next"" to ""I never saw that coming.""

Acting is really good too, cinematography is gorgeous, and the movie will throughout hold the attention till the very end. Also, best part is how wisely this movie delivers a great message without losing the quality of entertainment.

The plot was original, I haven't seen anything like it. The acting by Jason Bateman is something I haven't seen him do before. So it's was refreshing, and I admire the producers for putting him in that role. I someone thought about it after, wondered about the twist ending. I liked the pacing I felt it went at a good pace. But I wouldn't put it as one of my favourite films, but if you're looking for a toned down psychological thriller to just watch. Then this is it.",The Gift

It will not put fear in your mind, it will not make you bite your nails, it probably wont have you hooked either. It falls in the genre of movies where things climax or unfold towards the end. And once that happens you are not greatly moved or affected but you realize you ve just watched a pretty good movie. The movie has a slow, patient buildup, profiling a couple who have moved to a new town. It slowly builds their characters, and brings stories from their past. With every minute the story starts unfolding.Pretty good acting from the three main actors. Worth the watch on a slow boring weekend.",The Gift

It is all quite predictable apart from a minor twist at the end but for the most part we have seen it all before in other similar type movies. Lacked any real tension but if you like this type of movie then it is worth a watch but won't live long in the memory. I liked Rebecca Hall in The Town but she just lacked a bit of glamour in this film often looking very plain and just like Joel Edgerton with his rather weird hair colour had a bad hair day in this one. The Resident with Hilary Swank is a much superior movie to this but nevertheless for an evenings entertainment you could do worse as the character development is interesting, the score was well put together and Edgerton shows some promise as a Director in this his debut.",The Gift

Initially I avoided this film as personally I find the trailer a little lack lustre. Although there are several suspenseful moments the overall feeling is slightly flat. It's not quite a physiological thriller but not yet an action packed nail biter. The pace is slow, too slow and it's one of those were you are waiting for the pick me up. I also thought some of the story turns were underdeveloped in the sense that there was more that could have been built upon. The female character although played well was a bit limp, I certainly wouldn't be inviting strange men into the house when home alone and found the whole terrorised but sympathetic routine a bit aggravating.Overall it is not the worst film I have seen this year and has a few thrills but the slow pace and lack of any real excitement left me feeling unsatisfied.

My every conclusion to the movie have failed and it emerged to be completely different. It has got all the elements a mystery fan can ask for. Family centric mystery, some witty comedy and high levels of suspense.The movie is about a husband and wife who moved to the that street very recently and are visited by an old friend who might be a trouble to them. The story is very slowly unveiled as the visitor becomes more and more visible. I loved the way the story was wrapped up really like a present and only comes to limelight when the gift is opened. There is a message at the end of the movie if you can take that home.Jason Bateman, Rebecca hall and Joel Edgerton have all literally lived in their roles and are a delight to watch. Each of them did complete justice to their roles carrying the suspense element in their expressions too.But I am sure this movie will be one of those underrated movies which will not be talked about because the budget discrimination.Go watch it and you will know how good it really is.",The Gift

359,agenericperson,Intriguing thriller marred by lackluster twists,5,12 October 2015,"Lots of spoilers in this review. Read at your own discretion.This movie starts out really strong. It has some great performances. Jason Bateman really stands out. His dramatic acting is top notch and really serves to contrast his work done in such comedies as Arrested Development.The movie starts to take a turn south when it becomes revealed that Bateman's character, Simon, is hiding something. Simon is perhaps more responsible for things than he admits. It's not a bad idea in itself. It's just executed rather weakly here. The twist here is that he bullied Gordon in school. He accused Gordon of being gay and molesting another boy. This culminated in Gordon getting abused by his father. I've seen worse excuses for villains to act out in thriller movies, but this is still a pretty poor excuse. You can sympathize with Simon who says it's not his fault if Gordon's life turned out badly. He's largely right... but maybe that's part of the movie's point. If it is it was lost on me. Still the movie could have been forgiven if this was it's only plot problem. It's rather benign compared to its other one.The film ends with a stupid twist that frames it like Simon finally got his comeuppance. The truth couldn't be further from the truth. You might suspect some of this ending when it's offhandedly mentioned that Simon's wife, Robyn, has been fainting during the day. Fainting?! And they gloss that over. I don't have to be a film expert to know that's going to play further into the movie. What kind of people ignoring random fainting anyway? That's usually a sign of severe health problems. That just shows how far removed from reality the characters in this film are. Well, it is revealed that Gordon has been drugging Robyn. He videotapes himself doing this and cuts the video with the implication that he raped her. The point being that Simon will never know if she was raped and he will just have to suffer not knowing. This is all revealed after Robyn has a child. The film seems to suggest that the child is Gordon's and is a finally sort of ""gotcha"" from him to Simon. Even though Simon and Robyn are on the splits by the end of the movie, she is still very uncomfortable around Gordon. She has seen him do some very creepy things. If Simon came to her and told her she might have been raped and presented video evidence for this, she likely would have taken it seriously. They could have run a DNA test on the baby and if it was proved to be Gordon's had him arrested. Even if Simon didn't want to go to Robyn (which would be out of character for him), he could have presented the video to the police. The video shows him trespassing and drugging her. That alone would have been enough to warrant an investigation and put Gordon behind bars. The Whole notion that Gordon somehow got the last laugh is a flawed on.It just goes to show you a thriller can have great acting and great atmosphere but if it fails to deliver on story, the whole experience can fall apart.",The Gift

Down at the mall, they bump into an old schoolmate of Simon's (Gordo) and from this point he tries to strike up a friendship, initially by leaving the young couple gifts when they are not at home. Simon begins to balk at all this and soon shows his bullying style, and Bateman is perfectly suited in this role. His wife, Robyn is somewhat neurotic and Gordo a bit awkward and creepy. There is uneasiness every time they meet with Gordo and soon we are led to believe there is more to the schoolyard days than meets the eye. ""Let bygones be bygones?"".

Most psychopaths are no killers or even cause any physical damage to others, but they do cause a great deal of harm. He cheated so that he could get a good job, ruined the life of the guy with lies and so on... and lied -or at least concealed- the truth about himself. He was perfectly aware of his own personality, another trait of high functioning psychopaths. On the other hand there is the loser, Gordo, who couldn't get on with his life from Highschool. Whatever the cause, he just couldn't and got stuck in the past, spending 25 years planning and carrying out his revenge. If he was not born a psychopath, we may assume he became one because instead of letting go, he chose to devote all those years and energy to revenge when in fact, he could have chosen to start over.

366,t-23546,The Gift is Better Than Your Average Thriller,8,8 August 2015,"The Gift is written and directed by Joel Edgerton and stars Jason Bateman, Rebecca Hall, and Edgerton himself.Let me begin with this, the Gift is a wonderful surprise. With a trailer that makes this movie look like a generic thriller, it was nice to see an actually suspenseful and smart film in return.The acting across the board is excellent. There is not a single actor in this movie that didn't sell their role to the audience. Jason Bateman, mainly known for playing comedic roles, did a fantastic job. I love seeing actors play something that is out of their comfort zone. Joel Edgerton plays a creepy and odd character and pretty much hits the nail on the head. I can tell through his performance and directing that he really wanted to create a good thriller film. He succeeded in that completely. His directing does one thing that I love in horror/thriller films. The camera settles on a shot and doesn't cut away. Instead of moving on to the next shot, it stays on something which leaves an unsettling vibe to the audience. There were moments in this film where I truly felt creeped out by what I was seeing. He did a phenomenal job of build up for suspense.The story does a good job of making the viewer invested throughout. There was never a moment when I wanted the film to end. The constant suspense in this movie makes the audience beg the question every thriller should do; what's going to happen next?There is one small element in the Gift that I found kind of unnecessary. Without going into spoilers, the plot point just felt thrown in to make a certain character look even worse. However, the movie already did a fine job of establishing what the character actually is like and didn't need the extra story line. Overall, the Gift is substantially better than most ""wannabe thriller flicks"". The Gift has a mood to it that never really goes away. It sinks underneath your skin right from the beginning. If only most suspense driven movies had the soul that the Gift has.",The Gift
367,codex-92736,The Gift Review,7,17 October 2015,"""You think you're done with the past, but the past is not done with you.""SPOILER FREE ZONEThe Gift is a psychological thriller that makes you think the moment you step out of the cinema. Its about a married couple who happen to meet the husbands high school 'friend'. Things begin to get out of hand as he starts to get a little stalker like, but the story isn't so simple. The Gift stars Jason Bateman, Rebecca Hall and Joel Edgerton and is written and directed by Edgerton. This is his directorial debut.Let me start of by talking about the acting. Rebecca Hall gives a strong performance as the female lead but she wasn't one of the main two characters and rightfully so. As good as she was, Bateman and Edgerton are brilliant. Bateman doesn't get enough credit for his acting ability. Sure he pretty much does the same role in comedies, but the odd times he undertakes a serious one, the guy shows what he is capable of. His character had a lot of depth and he presented it to great effect in this movie. Now that being said, he isn't the stand out performance in this. Joel Edgerton is amazing. He is one of the rising stars of Hollywood and he deserves to be because of the amount of talent he has. He loses himself in playing Gordo. His directing style needs a little work but for a first movie, he looks like one to look out for. The Gift is made by the acting talent in it, but the story pushes it further up the score pole.The pacing of the movie is slow. If you go into it expecting fast paced, spine tingling thriller, you will be disappointed. But if you go into it with an open mind, it will entertain. Over everything movies have to have a good story to keep butts in seats. The Gift slowly builds the tension and doesn't allow the audience to put a pin on where the story is going. It makes you question what side you're actually on. And that's the sign of a good psychological thriller which this is.There are parts of the movie which could have been thought out a little better but all being said its worth watching. Plus Halloween is coming up.SCORE: 7.5/10SPOILERS GALOREBateman is brilliant at playing someone you love and playing someone you want to punch in the face. He can switch roles quickly and works well here. He starts the movie being a normal guy but by the end of it you really hate him but feel sorry for him a little too. It really makes you think about if you've done anything wrong to someone and if its going to bite you in the ass.Not enough praise can be given to Joel Edgerton. His first stand out role for me was Warrior. He showed a lot of promise in that, but since then has shone brightly in every role. I look forward to his movies now.SCORE: 7.5/10I'm just going to give a few people I haven't heard from in a while a call.https://chaoticneutralreviews.wordpress.com/2015/10/17/the-gift- review/",The Gift
368,bekka_j-65959,Something to hold my attention for once.,10,24 November 2015,"SPOILER ALERT -- SPOILER ALERT I pretty much agree with all the positive reviews for this movie. Although I don't consider myself a movie critic by any means, I will say that it's pretty difficult for a movie to captivate my attention; it happens once in a blue moon. That being said, I'm probably more difficult to please than the average viewer.What I loved about this movie: -The characters. I think one of the first things that drew me into the movie and kept hold of my attention was the fact that I was so impressed with how ""real"" the characters seemed to me. I personally felt most connected with Rebecca Hall's character/performance... I really felt like I could relate to her in a lot of ways (minus the pill usage). Her social awkwardness, especially, resonated with me and it was very authentic.I know everyone is praising Edgerton for his performance as Gordo, and while he obviously did an excellent job, in my opinion it was Hall that stole the show.I also really appreciated Bateman's performance, as he usually plays the sweet, shy, passive guy, and in this movie, he was truly the opposite. I loved hating him in this film.-The twist at the end. I saw that someone on here mentioned they had figured it out, and honestly I can't fathom HOW, unless they were previously given clues or the heads up that there was going to be a twist at the end of the movie by others who had already seen it.Normally, it's not too difficult for me to predict a twist. It's possible that I have just gotten myself too emotionally involved in this movie to think logically enough to ""solve"" the mystery. However, I think the bigger part of my inability to see what was coming at the end, had more to do with the fact that there were other subtle implications that had me more distracted. For example, all the talk in the beginning about the baby that they lost and Hall's ""issues"", led me to think that her fall had something more to do with her issues.Like I said, I was also really emotionally involved in this movie, and again, it had a lot to do with Hall's performance. Empathizing with her to such a strong degree in itself, I think, says heaps about the quality of this movie.-The ending in general. Usually I can't stand movies that leave you guessing at the end. I think that a lot of movies that end without answering all of your questions are either just poorly done/incomplete, or they're trying too hard to be artsy and cryptic... granted, I am all for artsy fartsy stuff, but it's painfully obvious when it's being forced. With all that said -- it worked perfectly in this movie, and I didn't feel the slightest bit irritated by it. I wish I could more eloquently put into words how the pieces fit together - again, I am not a self-proclaimed movie buff - but, it just seemed right for this particular film. If, at the end, he would have said for sure whether or not he actually did it... It would have been loads less satisfying. It seemed appropriate for Bateman's character to be left with that permanent ""unknown"" -- and hopefully feeling responsible for being such a sh*t person.Now... one big reason I wanted to write this review, was because someone else had mentioned something that got me to think more in depth about the plot and the ending. This particular review asked how exactly did Gordo win -- he left all of this evidence behind, which essentially, in the real world would just immediately land him in prison. And then it went on to say that Bateman could have moved on, found another wife, etc. and lived happily ever after...Regardless of how much I loved the movie, I think that person made an excellent point. One thing, however, that I think the movie wanted us to assume, is that Bateman's character never in a million years would have come forward with the ""truth"". He lied to his wife the entire movie, and if he came forward to his wife about what Gordo had done -- she certainly would hold Bateman responsible -- for what he did to Gordo, for hiding everything from her, for not doing something about the situation to keep them safe, etc. I mean, if it were me in her position, I definitely would have held him accountable.Another thing to consider is that even if Gordo was thrown in prison, that doesn't undo any of the pain that it caused Bateman. I think it's safe to say that even a bully in that situation, would have some sort of permanent despair over something like that.I don't know that Gordo's intention was to ""win"" as much as it was to simply hurt Bateman right back. And, considering that Gordo was obviously a psycho who already had a criminal record, I don't think that being put in prison would have made him feel any less satisfied with what he had done to get Bateman back. I don't really think that psychos have the same way of looking at things as most people do. I don't think that being put in jail has the same affect on them, as it would the ""average"" person.Gordo being caught wouldn't undo the f***ed-upness of the whole situation... it wouldn't magically make everything better, and then bam! Bateman's the winner.Despite all that, I appreciated that point of view to consider, because it was a good point to make.",The Gift
369,jkneafcy,Well worth a watch!,8,16 January 2017,"Gordo is weird. He's always been weird.But first...Simon (Bateman) and Robyn (Hall) move to, Simon's old stomping ground in California from Chicago due to his promotion. Happy couple on the up and up? Maybe. So off they go to buy furniture for their lovely new house.Enter, Gordon (Edgerton) aka Gordo. A chance meeting in the furniture store happens when Gordo spots Simon and recognises him and introduces himself, Simon takes some memory jogging but gets there in the end. Something isn't quite right about Gordo.Then the unexpected gifts and day time visits begin and Robyn, being too nice for her own good, repeatedly lets Gordo in. He's creepy but seemingly without malice until he spots Simon's less than charitable assessment of Gordo pinned to the fridge...From this point on nice but harmless Gordo takes a sinister turn, though Robyn can't decide if it's all in her mind or not and Simon becomes increasingly determined that she shouldn't worry about Gordo and equally unwilling to shed light on what is meant by ""let bygones be bygones"" in Gordo's parting letter.With seeming little else to do but run, drink sports drinks and keep house Robyn does some digging and uncovers what a shining example of a bully her husband once was and how a vile but baseless story from his past ruined Gordo's life.Simon continues with his career and wins another promotion, Robyn gets pregnant and barring the non-materialising threat of Gordo lurking in the background all seems well until the guy who Simon quietly stiffed out of the promotion arrives mid-dinner party and reveals that Simon knows all his old tricks and is still quite happy to use them. Robyn chooses this moment to go into labour.One birth later, Robyn drops the bombshell that she won't be returning with Simon, the revelations about her husband's character are too much for this new mum...as they are for his employer.Newly unemployed Simon returns home to shower in preparation for his attempt to save his marriage where he is greeted by four new gifts each more chilling than the next...I've said enough.The three main characters are excellently played, the script feels natural and the theme of moral duplicity leaves you with thoughts like; ""Poor Simon..but Karma's a bitch"", ""Poor Gordo...but you are a sick puppy!"" and ""Poor Robyn, she didn't deserve to get stuck in the middle of this!""It kept us guessing, Gordo's revenge is both fiendish and a brutal and my fiancée pretty much crushed my fingers thanks to the almost constant tension the film builds.Well worth a watch.",The Gift

I don't mind slow paced movies if they are artistic or subtly intriguing but for a movie so often described as a ""thriller"" I wanted a little more meat. I feel I wasted my evening.
The characters behaved stupidly, which wasn't helped at all by the terribly awkward acting.
The plot was a bit too abstract for me and not one moment moved me to fear or even the vaguest concern for the characters. Even the title's tie-in feels sloppily contrived.

375,yk-samp,A new layer for the mystery thrillers.,8,7 August 2015,"I was skeptical at first about seeing this movie because, frankly, the trailer was bad. It's not easy to make a trailer for such a movie, but it's possible! Case and point - Gone Girl. The trailer for Gone Girl was freaking awesome. In the mystery genre it's hard to make a trailer without: A) Spoiling the mystery or B) Bore your audience to death. But Gone Girl pulled it off and it was maybe due to the fact that the trailer makes you believe something that's not actually true I.E. a fake spoiler and so it managed to trigger curiosity.But enough about that, let's get down to the review!The Gift is a mystery thriller, if you haven't figured it out yet, and at the same time the directorial debut of Joel Edgerton. And boy, what a debut this is. The plot revolves around a married couple - Simon, played by Jason Bateman and Robyn, played by Rebecca Hall- who move to California in order to start a new life. At some point they run into Gordo - played by Joel Edgerton - one of Simon's quote unquote school friends. And from that point he starts quote unquote terrorizing them by randomly showing up at their house and giving them gifts(wink wink). And I am not going to say anything else about the plot. The story may not seem that interesting, but it's so much more than that. Gordo's character is not only a character; he is also a representation of the past, in this case Simon's past, and through him the movie showcases the theme of a haunting, long forgotten past, which is also foreshadowed through dialogue, and it doesn't affect only Simon, but also Robyn and the people around them. This theme is present throughout the whole movie, and it seems that Simon's past is more damaging to Robyn, because Simon refuses to live in the past. Two other themes evolve from that of the long forgotten past and those two themes are paranoia and obsession. Paranoya can easily be identified through Robyn's dreams and everyday activities and obsession represents in this case fear. There is also a strong contrast between the two main characters: Simon acts only for his own interest, while Robyn cares about others. Simon is rather carefree about Gordo, thinking that he can do him no harm, while, ironically, Robyn is the one who is afraid. And Simon is the one who tries to cover up the past, while Robyn is the one who's trying to uncover it. In contrast to the contrast, there is a symmetry between Simon and Gordo. I'm not talking about a physical, mental or social similarity, but rather a circumstantial one. Gordo, like Simon, is also haunted by his past, as we find out later in the movie, and they are both subjected to the influence of an idea, a story if you will, that sinks into your head and affects your life, whether it is true or not. As their conflict gets deeper and deeper, the movie starts to uncover more and more secrets. Gordo is the perfect impersonation of the damaging past, while Simon is the one who desperately tries to escape it after it catches up. But regardless of how hard we try to hide them, out secrets will eventually come out and haunt us for the rest of our life. You know what they say: You may be done with the past, but the past isn't done with you.Another great thing is the cast. Joel Edgerton doesn't attempt to steal the show, him being the director, but instead he gives a subtle performance and builds a surprisingly complex character with hidden intentions. Come to think about it, most of the movie is hidden in one way or another, but as time passes, it unravels on a perfect pacing and builds up an immense amount of tension before delivering a mouth- dropping, but fairly overstaying-its-welcome finale. But the show stealer is definitely Jason Bateman. He gives his best performance to date and really manages to deliver emotion and also pain. Each of the 3 main characters is damaged in its own way: Gordo has given up and sunk in the past and accepted living with it, Simon tries to escape the past, but is devastated when it catches up and Robyn becomes paranoid.All in all, it's a pretty solid movie, considering it's a directorial debut, and it's also easy to watch and enjoy. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes mystery - thrillers.",The Gift
376,lpquig,Don't let this film go unnoticed,8,12 August 2015,"Originally, I was planning on going to see Fantastic Four this weekend, but after hearing about what an abomination that was, I decided to see this film instead. And thank god I did.What surprised me going into this film is that it was written, directed by, and starring Joel Edgerton. I've been a fan of the guy's acting ever since Warrior, but I was a little bit concerned about what he was going to bring to the table with his script and his camera-work. First things first, the script is very well written. It feels real, with touches of very good humor. But I was most impressed with his direction. Right off the bat you'll notice Edgerton's use of windows to build tension. I found myself constantly on the look out for Gordo, Edgerton's character, who is the main antagonist of the film. His long, sweeping, pan shots really build tension, and I was on the edge of my seat for a lot of scenes in this film. There were a couple of cheap jump scares, but for the most part, he never lets the tension break. He also gives a very good, very subtle performance. His character holds a lot of grief and dark secrets, and he is able to show that without overdoing it. All in all, hats off to Edgerton all around.I have to talk about Jason Bateman as well. He is by far doing the best work of his career here. I totally forgot I was watching a primarily comedic actor. Also, Rebecca Hall gives a very good performance. The viewer primarily lives through her performance, as we see the story unfold just as she does. Great acting all around.There is a big reveal in this movie, and it is very good. I'm not going to say anymore because I don't want to give anything away, but it's a film that really made me think, and I appreciate that. I'm urging people to see this. Its a great thriller with some very interesting themes.",The Gift

Like Old Boy, it's a story about the past coming back to haunt the main character. It has secrets that come to light throughout the story line. But unlike Old Boy, The Gift leaves you feeling disappointed in the end.The only reason I didn't walk away from the film is because I was patiently waiting for the mind blowing secret to be revealed. Unfortunately that secret never came. Although there are secrets that come to light in the film, none of them are mind blowing or even shocking. The ending was also boring and if you've ever seen a movie before you'll see it coming from a mile away. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone and have no idea how it got 7.5/10 stars.",The Gift

So why would someone feel it necessary to keep giving gift after gift? What original gift could be so huge that you'd feel you could never repay? ""I believe that the bad things in life, they can be a gift...""This is a clever, psychological thriller that plays like a hold-your-breath slasher flick except the maniacal madman is not as obvious and the horror is in the back-story. Simon (Jason Bateman) and Robyn (Rebecca Hall) move from Chicago to Simon's hometown. They run into Gordo (Joel Edgerton), who went to high school with Simon. Gordo drops off a bottle of wine as a welcoming gift; the first of many gifts that continue to multiply as the plot deepens, the story weaves a keep-you-guessing path, and the reunion gets creepier and creepier.Edgerton directs himself as Gordo and exacts a perfect mix of empathy and psychopath. Bateman gives a great performance as you question whether the story he's telling is true or not. And the story...wow! It unwinds at a delicious pace and reveals itself just steps before you figure it out. It's smart and really makes you think about ""What does ""bygones be bygones"" mean?""Like nothing you've seen and a refreshing respite from the recent sequel/re-make/super hero fluff being delivered from the major Hollywood assembly line.

It is also not a thriller. I am not much of a thriller person but this film surely has nothing to scare you, give you the creeps or make you feel anxious about. The ending of the film is not good either. It does not give you the closure you are looking for. For me the whole movie has a lot of wholes and raises a lot of unanswered questions. such as where and how did Gordon find the married couple at the store ..Was it accidental or premeditated.. A s far as the acting it is good but for me at times flat.. Furthermore I found the movie a little slow and too long in duration. It could have been 10-15 minutes shorter..

This movie was surprisingly good and has opened my eyes to how intelligent thrillers can be. I don't want to spoil it for anyone or raise expectations too much since I am new to the genre. Just most movies I have seen in this category are not typically of this caliber. This one was really well thought out. The plot was very well woven together. All the story lines and details came together. At the same time, everything you think might happen gets turned on its head. ;-) Clichés are gone.The movie stars Simon and Robyn, a newly wed couple moved from Chicago come back home to LA where Simon grew up for a new job. Quickly into the movie, Simon bumps into a old childhood classmate named Gordo. As Simon puts it though, ""Gordo seems a bit off."" Very rapidly, the chance encounter escalates. Gordo ends up around more often than Simon would like. The encounters are awkward and uncomfortable but seemingly harmless, right? However, this movie really turns typical conventions on its head. The good guy and bad guy lines are very blurred. The movie lighting, casting, sound, and dialogue are all very strong. The actors all portray the appropriate emotion at the right time. There is just enough subtly to keep things interesting and mysterious. There is just enough excitement to keep you guessing about what's going to happen next.I am shocked this is not a more well known movie.Very well done!",The Gift

I can't imagine ANY educated,successful couple playing along with an unstable weirdo for more than a minute.The acting is second-rate from beginning to end, and I think that's because there's only so much any actor can do with a bad script.BTW: recently, while shopping for some good info about writing, I found that there are MANY books on ""how to write a screenplay.""

Some reviews are already comparing this movie to some Hitchcockian classics. Unlike cliché thrillers, the movie is not all about frightening dark scenes and screaming woman characters; Instead, it is based on representation on realistic emotions. The pace of the movie is so smooth that the character build up is done near to perfect. Twists are really interesting and entertains audience. The music didn't impress me.

384,dheeraj-08613,It is a cheap film,1,4 November 2015,"Edgerton concocted an interesting concept. He gave a compelling and creepy performance. His cast did a wonderful job of breathing life into these deeply flawed characters, ratcheting up the tension and drama to a dizzying peak. And then he chucked it all away with the kind of conclusion you'd expect out of brainless soap operas. He fouled the whole film in its final moments, leaving this critic disgusted. The film seems willfully ignorant of the existence of DNA tests. But even without that objection, it's still a mighty seedy button to hang your movie's hat on — yet another example of (usually male) TV writers and filmmakers using rape as a shock button that's pushed too frequently, and too carelessly.

Most thriller type films there are two stories of a goody and a baddie, in this thriller you will be contemplating with yourself on who is the goody or the baddie because in this fantastic film there are no sides to pick.The gift is about a couple who have just moved into the suburbs and are happy and content in their lifestyle, until a long lost friend from school shows up and starts leaving gifts. It all seems rather strange and the story then takes a turn for the worst when the husband of the couple Simon (Jason Bateman) decides he no longer wants anything to do with his long lost friend who is becoming a bit of a stalker. The story goes from bad to worse as it is no longer gifts that the couple receive but the complete opposite. You will find in this film that the characters change, they have completely different personalities to what they had at the very beginning of the film and you find yourself questioning the characters as they are not what you expect. The film throughout was gripping, it certainly kept my heart racing and it was so hard to look away. This thriller is one you just do not want to miss as it is so psychologically challenging that it will definitely leave you wanting to watch more.

This film captures your attention from beginning to end. His style of directing is very stunning. This mystery film is very similar to the 1995 film, ""Seven"". It has a very a dark and ominous tone. Once the film comes to a conclusion, you will be genuinely surprised and satisfied. All the performances in the film were great as well. Jason Bateman's character transition in the movie is quite riveting. As well as Rebecca Hall giving one top performances. Similar to one she gave in the 2006 film, ""The Prestige"".

That very night I went out to see it with a friend and I came home in awe of this fantastic film. Less than 48 hours later, I saw it for the 2nd time, with a bigger group of friends, yet again coming out in awe, seeing little things I had missed the first time. All I can is...

The first 20-30 minutes was just slow, awkward banter that was there to set up the movie (which I get), but it was so strained it felt uncomfortable watching it. My impressions was that Jason Bateman must have been desperate for cash to make this and that the rest of the actors were just new and haven't quite figured out how to act. The whole movie fairly predictable and not remotely entertaining. Don't waste your time on this one!",The Gift

396,marioandwes,"""The Gift"" is a gift to anyone who bothers to watch it.",8,14 August 2015,"""The Gift"" is Joel Edgerton's first film as a director (he also writes the film, and plays the character of ""Gordo""), and what a wonderful attempt it is. Let me start by saying that this is not the horror movie that the trailers make it out to be; it is a deep, psychological thriller that will leave you wondering how and why characters made certain decisions. The writing/dialogue is superb in this film: you have to really pay attention to every little word mentioned in the film, as they have a heavy significance on the outcome of the film. The writing would have been in vain were it not for the fantastic actors: Jason Bateman (Simon) takes a wonderful turn from his usual comedic roles, and puts in the best performance of his career, without a doubt. Rebecca Hall (Robyn) also turns in a fantastic performance as the scared, and somewhat confused, person in the midst of all the film's drama. However, the star was always going to be Joel Edgerton (Gordo). Edgerton was born for this role; he is so convincing as this ""weirdo"" that for two hours, I did not see Joel Edgerton; I saw Gordo. Edgerton is able to make the viewer sympathise with Gordo, despite the fact that he continuously delves deeper into the heart of evil with each of his actions. The slow shots in this film, and the way that Edgerton paces it is truly a sight to be seen. All of his shots are full of thought, and are extremely artistic. Overall, ""The Gift"" is the best film of 2015, so far, without a doubt. Ignore its trailers, and go out and watch the film, as it has not received anywhere near the amount of hype that it deserves. 8.5/10 Toes",The Gift
397,evanmyers15,"Good, But Not Great",7,7 August 2015,"The Gift is an emotionally charged thriller with some very good performances. The story has a lot of twists and turns, some of which are predictable, others I could not see coming at all. I really enjoyed the movie for the most part. The only aspect of the film that I did not like was that Simon(Bateman) is just not a very likable character. From the first dinner scene to the final act, he just did not appeal to my taste. This caused the emotional impact at the end to be lessened for me a lot. I didn't feel the emotion at the end that director Edgerton(who did a very excellent job behind the camera) wanted the audience to feel. The film itself is entertaining and there are some very suspenseful shots in it. It wasn't as much a thriller as a drama, however it was engaging, well worth a viewing.",The Gift

Interesting story, big fan of thrillers and yes the message is clear and I guess a nice (satisfactory) one. I am driven by the same philosophy don't do unto others what you don't want others to do unto you, but something is missing to be more then just an interesting movie. As the movie went all of the possible scenarios started to fade and you can easily predict the ending (sort of) and it lacks the moment of eyes opening and jaw dropping.Don't get me wrong it is a good movie but not quite what I hoped for.

Nothing specific mentioned.The problem is if you've seen a film with a similar concept I doubt the film will hold any surprises. Plot threads unravel predictably with if anything an extra fake out for certain assumptions but non the less still feeling a bit to unremarkable in directions the story takes. The worst cliché is the change in characters as new plot points are revealed characters dramatically change in personality to just over the degree in which I'd feel is realistic, with characters requiring to be unreasonable in the later half for an ending that is played off as life ruining, only when a modicum of thought needed to see the multitude of flaws in a character's plan.It's a solid film with good direction and pace, reasonable acting and writing, enjoyable in short, however if a cliché thriller plot might bother you then it might be worth skipping.",The Gift
402,Andrew_Dawson,Joel Edgerton's Directing Debut Was....,8,29 August 2015,"A SUCCESS! I mean, obviously I thought so, rating it an 8 out of 10, but wow, this was a great thriller. The story starts with introducing Simon and Robyn, a married couple moving to California for Simon's new job. There, they run into Gordo, Simon's former high school classmate, which sparks a chain of events consisting of gifts, horrifying past secrets, and an ending no one saw coming.The three main roles were played to perfection throughout the whole film. Rebecca Hall (Robyn) did a great job of playing a troubled wife trying to figure out what in the world is going on. Jason Bateman (Simon) steps out of his comedic comfort zone and shocks the audience with his gritty performance as a husband who is more than what meets the eye. And lets not forget Joel Edgerton (Gordo) putting on a fantastic performance as a mysterious, creepy guy who no one feels comfortable being in the same room with.Throughout the whole movie, my heart was pounding through my chest and I was constantly wondering what was going to happen next. If that's not a recipe for a good thriller, than I don't know what is. But beyond the feeling of intensity throughout, the plot also had me very intrigued. Edgerton laid out a unique story that made me want to pay attention and try to figure out why certain things were happening. And the ending had me literally holding my hands on my head in disbelief. Honestly, without the critical and commercial success of this movie, I probably would've taken a pass on it. However, The Gift was definitely worth seeing and one of the better films I've seen lately. Constantly wondering what was going to happen and resisting the urge to look away due to the wonderful suspense, I am excited for what Edgerton has in store for us next!",The Gift

Looking forward to more Edgerton!,9,13 August 2015,"If this film is any indication, then count me as a fan who will be watching very closely by more work by Joel Edgerton.The trailer tells a compelling story, but really only scratches the surface of how deep this film really is (don't worry - no spoilers here.) The complete story is so much more than what you may think you're signing up for - which I've always considered a good thing.The characters develop throughout the course of the film in often unexpected ways...and they develop so wonderfully slowly and subtly, such that the transformation feels so real...and each character perfectly embraces the circumstances they're put in with again a key realism and gripping nature that is really seldom seen.I personally found the Rebecca Hall, who plays Robyn, incredible in this film. Can't dive into more without giving too much away, but suffice it to say I found her character to be nothing short of an absolute triumph of the human spirit.Did I mention cinematography? It was stunning. The opening shots say it all. The whole film felt like an homage to an Alfred Hitchcock-style film making - keeps you on edge and fills the screen with meaning and depth without all the cheap scares that fill today's modern thriller. I've heard it said that horror is not gore, it's metaphor...and this film is truly horrifying...while being so much more at the same time (again would love to elaborate, but you'll just have to see it!)

As far as what I expected from the film, it looked to be a typical stalker film that I have seen many times before. But this movie took it to another level through great acting by all cast members and great directing by Joel Edgerton as well as his role as Gordo. This film is different from other stalker flicks because of its unique story and slow pace. This movie is not movie by any stretch, yet I had no problem staying engaged through the entire film. I do not wanna spoil anything so I will just end by saying you should go watch this film if you enjoy great acting and intense moments and are looking to avoid the new Fantastic 4.",The Gift
407,rem-48710,Good but not without flaws,7,11 November 2015,"I liked this movie but it had some issues.Jason Bateman, Rebecca Hall and Joel Edgerton all gave great performances in my opinion and I especially loved Bateman in a serious role. He really delivered and I hope he does more in the future. I'm a big fan of his.This was a good thriller and had me on the edge of my seat for much of the movie not knowing what would happen next and pleasantly surprised that there was no gore or excessive violence involved. My issues really had to do with Gordo and his ability to ""stalk"" in such an advanced way for such a seemingly stupid guy. How did he get into their home, make a key, record them etc ALL without them ever seeing him do these things? Doesn't make any sense. Also, if Gordo had such a grudge against Simon, why did it take them bumping in to each other at a store for these feelings to be acted upon? If he really blamed Simon for ruining his life, one would think he would have sought Simon out a LONG time ago and started wreaking havoc on him before and not just after some chance encounter. Makes no sense. Also, even though Simon is obviously no saint (even in present day), I still sympathized with him and never sympathized with Gordo (which I think I was supposed to according to the movie). Gordo was creepy....and he got even creepier when it was implied that he raped Robyn. What did she ever do to him?? And was that his kid or not? Did he or didn't he? If he did, how is that getting back at Simon? Gordo will end up in jail after a paternity test is done since the dummy recorded his breaking and entering. Simon's life unraveling had nothing to do with Gordo and everything to do with Simon's own actions. Because of this, Gordo's ""revenge"" really made no sense. Gordo was more of an annoyance than anything else in my opinion.Anyway, even with these issues, I still thought the movie was a good thriller and well acted and would recommend it.",The Gift

Anyway, this film has exactly what we want, a great story, great acting and an unexpected but really satisfying ending. What we liked was that it took a while to work out who the real villain was and even then it twists a few times before you get it. It was pleasure to watch. Also, my wife can usually predict most plots and she's also extremely critical of poor films but this one took her by surprise which is great because I always get the blame when I pick a rubbish one!

409,mrscharlesfernandez,Best Movie,10,2 July 2016,"I recently saw ""The Gift"" in Stan, a Mystery/Thriller movie which I was very pleased with the movie. I have to add this is one the best sweet revenge movie I have ever seen. Bullies will always be bullies, during and after school times. This is something everyone needs to understand. They would continue lashing their bullying ways in the working world far worse than when they were in school. Sadly, most developed first world schools continue to ignore this problem. Coming back to ""The Gift"", it's about a life of a bully, how the revenge sips in with little effort. A must watch movie, bullies always think they can get away with everything, but if we take a bit of effort and then just let go, let loose, their perfect life just come crumbling down just like this movie. Most movies these days usually has same-old plain start, with disrupted, questioning story line with the endings are usually left hanging and the end of the movie we ask ourselves, ""Why did we watch that movie?"" The Gift, this movie is a different experience altogether. From the beginning, it makes you sit in, relaxed and wants to watch more and when you do, you question yourself, keeps you on your toes and wanting to know what is going to happen next. All the queries you have in your mind explained, asking yourself what's next, what does he mean, and at the end, it's just simply superb. The ending, sweet, perfect, a bit of laughter. To top it off, The Best Movie of All Time!",The Gift

411,davadog13,"An original, Hitchcockian thriller in disguise",8,12 January 2016,"When I hit the 20 minute point of this film, I was ready to turn it off. I paused it and went to take a shower. I started thinking about the unanswered questions the movie slipped into my brain. I decided to finish it just for that closure. Upon returning to, and ultimately finishing, the film, I came to the following conclusion: The Gift is an original, Hitchcockian thriller in disguise.Joel Edgerton (in both actor and director chairs) uses a number of thriller tropes to his advantage in the set-up of this film. The music guides the audience through typical movie moments of discomfort and we are subtly urged to conclusions without being given outright evidence. This is where I almost walked away, but the other thing Edgerton does really well is that he creates a little seed of doubt and question. This concept is also a theme discussed in the film in pivotal moments. I was incapable of walking away because of my need to know the whole story. I was even ready to suffer through what I assumed would be a sub-par plot just to attain that knowledge.I do feel there were a couple moments of lazy storytelling. Motherhood is introduced as something of importance to Rebecca Hall's character early on. It's introduced somewhat subtly at first, but then, almost as if yelling to the audience members who couldn't catch the subtlety, there's a short, maybe 45 second scene in which the idea is basically fed to the audience, subtlety removed. I think Edgerton could have trusted his audience a little more.However, this flaw is my only major gripe as I was captivated through most of the film. It also created a genre in my mind tentatively called ""horror films for people with social anxiety,"" but that's a different post entirely.This film certainly shows that Edgerton has filmmaker chops and it has earned an automatic ticket purchase for whatever he puts out next.",The Gift

The movie initially had me on the edge of my seat but the ending definitely ruined it for me and left me baffled. If you enjoy unfinished movies I would definitely recommend this to you.

414,bluevelvetmoon,Wasted Potential,3,6 May 2020,"Guessed the first plot twist within 15 minutes of the movie and was disappointed to know there was nothing really significant after that. Robin's character fell flat and she portrayed the typical flightly, damsel in distress. Her reasoning was rrational too. Her husband, Simon, does a background check on the guy who's consistently at their doorstep and she's mad at her husband? I mean, come on. Plus, her uncomfortableness within the home makes her relapse on pills? Then her addiction is never mentioned or delved into after that. A lot of the plot points felt scattered and misplaced, this being one example. Another example, Simon's random fear of monkeys. Yes, a big bad bully is scared of a butt scratching primate. Then there was that odd mention of molestation and how it was all faked by Simon. If it was a fake rumor then how and why in the world did Gordo's father call him gay and try to murder him? Motives did not make sense in this movie.Now to the 2nd plot twist, where the baby may or may not be Simon's. This was also easy to guess after she suddenly faints and insists it wasn't the pills. I mean, if the protagonist insists they aren't crazy they usually aren't, so one can assume she was raped. In the end Simon is crying in a hallway while his wife is cradles a child with an unknown father. Instead of moping around, Simon can tell his wife and show her, and the courts, the surmountable evidence they have against this nut. But no, the big bully is left to cry in a hallway instead of using rationality. The story would've been better if it was dedicated to defeating that rapist but instead the movie delivers some cheap, sappy lesson on karma.",The Gift

418,mikedingo-29480,The Gift was not what I wanted. Not my style. Not my size either. Plus I never asked for it.,3,24 June 2021,"""The Gift"" is a pretty film to look at, but it's pseudo-cerebral to the point of being corny. And it's too predictable to be entertaining. I'd suggest that you watch ""The Gift"" only if you're absolutely determined to watch all of the movies ever made where the protagonist-villain justifies his anti-social behaviors based on his adolescent reading of Friedrich Nietzsche. If that's actually what you're up to then I wish you luck. You're in for a hard slog. You might want to reconsider that plan. My suggestion: skip the many overman-as-supervillain films that are out there and just watch a Fish Called Wanda. By the end of that film you'll have arrived exactly where you need to be. And you'll save a bunch of time in the process.Who suggested that you watch this stinker anyway? Just curious. My ex fancied herself to be something of a beyond good and evil type trickster. She enjoyed being manipulative. She totally loved this movie and a few other stalker type movies. Funny, right? In retrospect, I think that her fondness for this film means she didn't see Gordo for what he really was: a hurt child who's stuck in a grownup's body.This isn't exactly a spoiler: about halfway into ""The Gift"" we learn that Gordo was the victim of horrible bullying and social isolation when he was a young kid. What happened to him wasn't his fault. In response to being victimized, he grew up living like a pariah. And just like so many genius-level bad guys do, he trained his mind to be tough by devouring modern German philosophy! Then, by the time he became an adult, he's was ready to earn his fortune quickly and do whatever he liked! That's because he's a genius who's totally unencumbered by society's rules. Yawn.The bad guy who lives his life based on the writings of Neitsche trope is getting really tired. Gordo isn't a super-genius villain at all, even though that's what the film insists he is one. In reality, Gordo is a jerk who doesn't respect other people's boundaries. He has bad manners. That's his super power! From the start of the film Gordo went into Simon and Robyn's personal space and into their lives in a way that they didn't expect. He confused them. He crossed the lines of polite society apparently without so much as a care. And he while he was doing all sorts of terrible things to them he did a decent job of pretending to be nice. That's even more confusing, right? At a certain point, Simon and Robyn realized that he wasn't playing by society's rules. That's when they politely asked him to respect their privacy. In response to that reasonable request, he acted as though he was very hurt. Then he tricked Simon and Robyn into fighting with each other. It this sounds familiar it's because it's all laid out in the first couple of pages of the Cliff Notes on How to Behave Like a Sociopath. These are just cheap tricks. While Chris may have succeed in tricking some people with these strategies, it's only because the targeted people didn't understand that game. They they became victims only because they were unable to understand that people like her really exist in the world. Sure, she may deliver cruelty with style, but that doesn't equate to being a genius. Just like most scam and cons, the whole success of the scheme relies entirely on of the target's good nature and willful blindness to reality.By the end of the film it's clear that our protagonist only ever had one trick: being unashamed to unilaterally take advantage of the social contract that collectively keeps us all safe and happy. In other words, he's pretty much the same as a common criminal. Ultimately, when we look back at the story, it's clear that Gordo's plan would not have worked nearly as well as it did if his targets were slightly more clever. They wouldn't have had to be geniuses or even middle-smart people to have seen what Gordo was up to. With just a little bit of insight into the situation they would have dispensed with their assumption that Gordo was bound by the social contract just like they were. They would have stopped being nice to him! That would have been a much more real story I think. Imagine a movie in which Simon and Robyn totally figured out Gordo's game early on? What would they have done?",The Gift
419,luki-cool2000,Joel Edgerton's directorial debut is astonishing.,8,1 November 2015,"Joel Edgerton, one of the most promising Aussie actors in recent years, expresses his vision for family-oriented thriller movie in the form of 'The Gift'. The movie shows his capability as a first-time widescreen movie director. He also acts as the screenwriter and the actor on this film.The story mainly focuses on the conflict among three main characters. Robyn (portrayed by Rebecca Hall) as a wife who struggles to have a baby while maintaining her relationship with her husband and the neighborhood where she lives in. The husband Simon (portrayed by Jason Bateman) that is depicted as a successful person both in the past and present. Then, we have Simon's buddy in the past Gordo (brilliantly portrayed by Joel Edgerton) who come back to Simon's life and later drives him and Robyn in madness.Unlike his previous roles in Hancock or Horrible Bosses, in which he is quite often involved in silly situations, Jason Bateman tries to break typecasting by portraying someone that experiences dramatic changes after he meets his high school friend Gordo. Although we will see such changes, it is no doubt that sometimes his portrayal lacks of convincing sense, and it brings us back to the memory where we should watch him on a comedic movie instead.Meanwhile, Rebecca Hall brings a character that has to briefly battle her anxiety throughout the movie. Such expression is somewhat reminds us to the other struggle characters that she has portrayed before such as those in Ben Affleck's The Town or Wally Pfister's Transcendence.A credit should be given to Joel Edgerton. Not only does he deliver a tremendous performance as a mysterious and unpredictable Gordo, he also manages to create a fascinating screenplay with a twisted plot at the end. The plot might slow down in the middle of the movie, but it's interest level rises again during the last one third part. Particularly for that part, Edgerton creates a twisted element that is somehow similar to that from Park Chan-Woon's Oldboy. However, Edgerton delivers it with different execution and bring a question at the end. Those are the factors that make the film more interesting.The cinematography is good whereas the editing level is also comparable to other modern-day thriller movies. The shocking moments, meanwhile, are not as many as I have expected, but they come at the right time.Overall, through this movie, Edgerton has proved that he is one of the directors (as well as screenwriters) that has has bright prospect in upcoming years. The Gift makes him as the next Ben Afflect who also started his career as an actor and later opened the eye of critics by directing an amazing movie Gone Baby Gone.",The Gift

Its a good twist, but i did guess before it happened, there is a lot of unnecessary diversions and back stories. Overall Jason Bateman does a good job of helping you cling on to watching more of this film. I think it's overrated to be given a 7.7 It's a one time watch, rather forgettable.

Following the flow of the events, the perspective of the audience on the characters changes.

424,BrooklynGail13,A Promising Look Into Psychological Impact,8,24 January 2016,"In what seems to be 2015's overlooked golden thriller, The Gift is a guessing game far beyond words. Introduced almost as a typical stalker-thriller, the Gift blossoms into a film fueled by perspective. In what they believe to be a fresh start, Simon and his troubled wife Robyn settle into their new home hoping to flee the bustle of busy Chicago and lay to rest an even more emotional crisis. When Simon encounters an old high school acquaintance,strange and unsettling circumstances begin to distract from their fresh, new beginning.The mysterious Gordo, played passionately by director Joel Edgerton, sets the stage with a Dahmer style disposition that can easily be misunderstood as ""lost puppy""syndrome. However, his innocence is plagued by the affirmation of a strand of untruths, which propels Robyn and Simon's already billowing hesitations.Robyn, the struggling want-to-be mother with a pill popping past, grows more and more desperate for answers when Simon insists on shutting ""Gordo the Weirdo"" out and laying ""bygones"" to rest. On what becomes a terrifying and eye opening endeavor, Robyn uncovers secrets far deeper than she had begged to discover.The most compelling part of the film for me was the unshakable sense that no being can escape their past. We often find ourselves building barriers to protect ourselves from the only thing that can set us free, truth. Try as we may, and as often as we succeed, changing ourselves is a struggle far beyond burying memories. To me, this movie speaks volumes about coming to peace with the past. Simon, brilliantly played by Jason Bateman, is inherently desperate to control his life. In this, he has always plowed through other people, bullying his way through successes, and I believe even deterring himself from recognizing his own mistakes. He was blatantly unwilling to be accountable for anything other than being great. Within this, he finds himself desperately using his innocent, ""always successful"" facade to hinder others from believing so. It isn't until the absolute final moments of this film that Simon himself becomes overwhelmingly regretful of his own character.This movie also brings to light the impact of our own actions, our own personal evils. What we do,what happens to us, inevitable circumstances, like anything else, are especially impactive on our own beings. They ARE us. The real question here is, can we overcome our own journeys, or will we succumb to the battle between what has passed, and what may come?This realization is masterfully demonstrated in the last two shots of the film. One, a crumbling man truly feeling the impact of his decisions, and another, damaged by a painful past, dedicated to driving that pain to its genesis. Filled with questions far beyond a simple answer, the Gift is worth the watch for anyone willing to read deeper into the human psychological disaster.",The Gift

I was thoroughly entertained for most of the movie as this movie builds and maintains your suspense masterfully. It has just enough ambiguity and creepiness to keep you on the edge of your seat. Also, I thought all of the actors/actresses played their roles very well. That was what I liked about the movie. Now let's get to why I rated it a 3 out of 10. While I thought this had sind serious potential, it just never really delivered. You kept waiting for it to really get good and you kept your hopes up until the credits started rolling and you realized that nothing actually really ever happened in this movie. You waited and waited and nothing. Without giving anything away, the big secret of the husband's past is not nearly as twisted as you hope it will be, which kind of just kills the movie when you realize there isn't more to it.

The acting is OK but none of the characters are likable, so it's difficult to get involved enough to care what happens to any of them. Unfortunately, I saw the 'twist' coming so it wasn't at all as suspenseful as I'd hoped. Maybe I'm good at picking up on clues or maybe other reviewers don't pay attention, hence their surprise. Even the ultimate victim is too two dimensional to pity and the 'shock' twist wasn't as shocking as it could have been. I don't understand the 7.5 rating, I'd give it 5.8 max and this is my favourite genre.

Also, why would Gordo shot this weird video with him touching Robin and all if he wasn't sure she would get a baby?The thing with that Simon's eyes are blue but the baby's are brown isn't a big deal, as it's a big chance for both parents to have blue eyes and get a brown-eyed baby, Or at least that what I've been taught in Biology class.The thing I liked the most about that movie that it's not just another film about a guy who got bullied and turned up to be a successful man who got over his past and all this rubbish!

The plot is simple, revenge, that's it but it still takes more than half the movie for it to begin. The first half of the movie can be argued to build characters, but there is no semblance of a story of coherent plot line. Sure the characters are there, but there's no actual tension until one small incident which either causes the biggest overreaction in history or the movie has wasted all the time until then to start the tension. The movie relies on the creepiness of a person being nice. There is perhaps one or two good scenes, but overall this isn't scary and lacks much surprise or tension/suspense. That's another thing, a lot of this movie is predictable. The characters are also atrocious. Are you supposed to root for the douche-bag couple or the rapist psycho? I don't know, but you decide. Also, the ending is completely undeserved. It's supposed to be the big finale where the villain/hero's master plan comes to fruition, but half of what happens as a comeuppance is entirely coincidental and isn't from the direct action of the villain/hero. This movie has such promise, but failed at being scary, well written, and anything good at all. I saw it for free and I still feel robbed. When the audience laughs more than in an actual comedy, that's bad. I wanted this to be good, but it's too slow, poorly paced, and sloppily written.",The Gift

The scene where Simon is walking up to Gordo and tried to apologize and Gordo is not willing to accept his apology. Simon just starts to push him, kick him, knocks to the ground and kicks his things.. even after all of this Gordo just stands there and takes it and tried to pick up his things..

Gordo slowly starts attaching himself to their lives. This clearly defines Gordo as being the physchopath. However as the plot carries forward the movie slowly starts to twist into a game of back and forth on who the true villain is. I went into this movie expecting it to be just like any other mystery suspense movie but came out with a boggled mind. This movie truly surprised me with how good it was. It was a very well thought out and organized movie leaving you unlike most mysteries with a million questions. What happened to who and, who did what. Joel Edgerton did an absolutely amazing job for his first movie. Jason Bateman who I was skeptical about playing this role did a great job in playing such a dramatic bully. I thought it would be hard to picture Jason in a serious role but once the movie started that was the last thing I could picture.

439,grand-15854,Dumb,2,17 August 2015,"OK how does the ending make any sense?How exactly did Gordon get even with Simon? Simon loses his wife and job (both do to Simon actions not Gordon's). Gordon wouldn't know that he was losing either of those just that he took away his ""family"" which Simon already had done since his wife implies she wants a divorce after having the baby. So technically all he has done is take away the son Simon never had. Which Simon now wont have to pay for after the implied divorce thanks to Gordon. Gordon gave Simon all the proof Simon needs. The Restraining order, the video of Gordon getting ready to rape his wife and the baby's DNA. If wife didn't sleep with Gordon and would testify to that Gordon goes to jail. So how exactly does that get him even with Simon? Sweet Gordon is in jail for rape, and Simon is still free, he could go have more kids, get another job, get another wife. So how exactly did Gordon get even? Gordon as already shown that he is a loser, does he not think Simon wont go and get even with him? Seriously, he already showed to lose his temper when apologizing. Especially now that he doesn't have to worry about a job, wife, or kids? It would be Open season, on Gordon. I know this is a good movie, to teach those that bully that it can come back to get you, but lets be honest, if your willing to go to all those lengths to get even, you have expect them to come right back at you. The ending makes no sense, unless you want a squeal about how Simon get even with Gordon. Sorry its a decent movie but that's not how the real world works in the ending.",The Gift

Who cares if he was a bully a million years ago in High School? And why is his wife so annoying? Poking and prodding into something just because some creep wrote let bygones be bygones in a note. And what the heck is up the scene that he recorded in the house with Simon's wife? He raped her to get back at Simon and then at the end we are left guessing who fathers the baby? This movie gets 3 stars simply because Jason Bateman is awesome.",The Gift
441,bradvassar-20669,How bullying can permanently affect the lives of both the bully and the victim.,9,21 September 2015,"""The Gift"" is ultimately an underrated movie. The film captured my attention from the opening scene and managed to keep it until the final credit. I was literally on the edge of my seat through the entire experience. The story is exhilarating and the acting was phenomenal. Everything about the film is terrific. It is a mystery thriller that will take you by surprise every opportunity it gets. It makes you question who the real ""bad guy"" is and who you should feel bad for. The person who used to get bullied and is getting his payback or the bully who is attempting to turn over a new leaf?The movie is about the victim, Gordo, of a high school bully who is reconnecting with his tormentor, Simon, in their adulthood. At first Simon doesn't recall mistreating Gordo in school but Simon and his wife, politely, invite Gordo over for dinner where they realize that he is socially awkward, like he was as a teenager. He never really changed. But soon after that night Gordo made himself a constant in their lives by coming to their house unexpectedly, calling the two of them regularly, and bringing them ""gifts"". Once Simon finally mentions to Gordo that he doesn't want to have a relationship with him, things take a turn for the worst. Gordo is now seen as a permanent threat. Gordo's angle in this story is to get payback on Simon for something he did to Gordo in the past that completely changed his life, and it leads to an epic conclusion.The film stars Jason Bateman, Joel Edgerton, and Rebecca Hall. All three of these actors put forth an amazing performance. Joel Edgerton wrote and directed this movie throughout playing the role of Gordo. He successfully made me creeped out by Gordo while sympathizing for him at the same time. You actually feel sorry for the guy who is supposedly harassing this ""innocent"" family. Jason Bateman did an excellent job portraying Simon. Bateman is a comedic actor who usually plays the same guy in all of his movies but he came out of his shell for ""The Gift"". I honestly believed that Jason Bateman was Simon. His performance actually made me love and hate the character. The film allowed him to show how talented he can be. Rebecca Hall's character is sort of the centerpiece to the story. She play's Simons wife and she's on his side, however, she doesn't think Gordo is all that bad. She is conflicted to whose side she should lean towards. Her character ties the whole movie together. Edgerton did a tremendous job at creating remarkable character development between the three of them.The cinematography in this film is preeminent. It is very slow- paced but maintains intensity. Joel Edgerton managed to film this movie in a way that slowly escalates from scene to scene. It gets creepier and creepier and the eerie way the scenes are shot leaves your heart pounding. The way the camera gently goes around a corner of the house or how the lights dim to create tension is sensational. The soundtrack softens during intimidating dialogue and it heightens at fitting occasions. The reason Edgerton directed, wrote, and acted in this movie is because he had a specific vision for the outcome and he pulled through.All in all, the movie was outstanding, beyond doubt, and I cannot wait to see it again. If I was asked to give a synopsis of the film I wouldn't be able to simply because the trailer is so much different than what the movie is actually about. ""The Gift"" is about much more than a stalker causing mayhem in a couple's lives, it's truly about how the past can catch up with you and how one thing you do or say can greatly impact another person's life deeply. It provides so many morals and values and it genuinely teaches a lesson about bullying and how it can affect others. Due to the surprisingly good acting, filming, and story arc, I give this movie a nine out of ten.",The Gift
442,binnington,OK film,5,10 November 2015,This film was OK wasn't the best what i through of the film bit of a let down but my review is different to other people.There was some good bits and good acting but the ending wasn't good as i through it would of been.I through there would be a good cliff hanger but there wasn't.But good things about the film was the acting and the film.

443,command-00188,"The movie is a masterpiece, artful and mysterious.",9,15 November 2015,"This movie was one of the best thrillers I've ever seen, it featured great suspense and clues. Joel Edgerton created a masterpiece in this movie I look forward to see more movies by him. His style of directing is amazing, and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The writing was flawless and the twists mind blowing. One of the things that sets it apart, is the way it plays out. Most movies these days rely on violence and gore. This movie is not like them. The Gift plays on tricks of the mind. I recommend for lover of suspenseful thrillers like Alfred Hitchcock.The movie is not for everyone, like most movies in its genre. It is deep and strong, it makes you think about it after you are done watching it. I like the way Edgerton cut it and kept you thinking. It is a tad bit slow, but not dry, the story develops well. The acting was good on all fronts, I could not find any slip ups. The music was amazing and fit the movie wonderfully.",The Gift
444,laurakhouri,Much more than what you expect. Watch it!,9,1 July 2018,"I start watching this movie thinking it would be another ""stalker from the past comes to make a family's life a real living in hell and everything turns out fine at the end"", but no, this movie is a psychological horror-thriller with so many details! And the end.. omg, a really good movie",The Gift
445,my-46144,Simply Outstanding,10,13 July 2017,"I have watched this movie more than a few times. It is simply outstanding. Joel Edgerton as the writer of this impressive script, actor, and director did an outstanding job juggling these roles-- pulling off an exceptional production. The cast is perfect. I wouldn't supplant one actor for another. It manages to be poignant and mysterious without being uncomfortably disturbing--which is cool. The psychological intrigue and suspense obviates the need for the typical default blockbuster distraction. There are layer upon layers of visceral exchanges that make this movie, hands down, one-of-a-kind. This is one of my favorite movies of all times---and that's saying a lot. It would be great if Joel Edgerton chose to write a ""The Gift II"" or whatever he might choose to call it. This movie is perfectly set for a sequel that could be equally as suspenseful. It would be even greater if the exact same cast was kept intact.",The Gift

447,lynncarey-89177,Bret Kavanaugh,9,16 December 2018,Wow! I didn't know they made a movie loosely based on Bret Kavanaugh?!!!,The Gift
448,stellaaaaa-39756,Loves it!,8,11 February 2019,Went in with basic 'Jason's Bateman' expectations and was nicely surprised. He plays a great straight guy and is surprisingly good without having to be humorous.I didn't see the turn coming on his character and that made it all the more interesting.Had enough interest to keep me planted and pausing only to refuel for food and beverage.,The Gift
