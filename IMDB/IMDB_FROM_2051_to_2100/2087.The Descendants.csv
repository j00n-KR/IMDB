0,MartinHafer,Very well done....but not exactly Best Picture Oscar material,8,6 March 2012,"For the last several years, there have been a lot more Best Picture nominees at the Oscars due to a rule change. While at first I thought this would be a good thing, I now see it as a mistake because many exceptional films are getting nominated--though they are not of the same caliber as the rest of the nominees. ""The Descendants"" is such a film--very good but also clearly not in the same league as films like ""Hugo"" and ""The Artist"". BUT, and this is important, it still is a very good film and I strongly recommend it. George Clooney was very good in the film and I do feel that this performance deserved a nomination. He did a fine job playing an odd sort of guy--a guy who seemed totally lost and a bit inept--and a bit of a departure for him.This film begins with a woman on life support. She's not going to recover and death is inevitable. Her husband (Clooney) suddenly is thrust into a new role--one he should have been in all along. But, he worked hard and like many men knew nothing about actually nurturing his family. This man now is sort of like a mother AND father and has to provide support for his kids--kids who apparently have been having problems long before the accident. Oddly, however, despite this being a very serious topic, the film, at times, is a bit comical in how it handles this--much like real life. I liked this and it kept the film from being relentlessly depressing. So, having the oldest daughter dating an idiot and some of the odd light moments helped keep my interest--much more than a typical 'tragedy' film.I could say more about the plot but won't. I knew about the BIG twist in the film but know that many out there don't. I liked the twist, as it made the story much more cloudy--it wasn't just a matter of a woman dying and the family being left to grieve. And, some of the friends and extended family were complicated and not especially nice--much like real life. Overall, an excellent film--and one well worth your time. Just don't expect that it is brilliant--nor did it have to be. For what it is, it's quite good.",The Descendants
1,TheLittleSongbird,Family tragedy in Hawaii,8,20 February 2018,"With the promising cast, an interesting subject matter, the substantial awards attention, the critical acclaim and being familiar with and highly appreciating much of Alexander Payne's work (especially 'Sideways', his recent film 'Downsizing' is an exeption), interest in seeing 'The Descendants' was high.On the most part, after finally seeing it, 'The Descendants' delivers. It's not perfect and it doesn't quite make it in my list of my favourite films of 2011. It's not Payne's best or my favourite of his, as indicated already that's 'Sideways' while also loving 'About Schmidt' and 'Election'. Its many good points however are outstanding and far outweigh the issues, making it a very good film and almost (but not quite) great one. Considering though that it had all the ingredients to be great, that it wasn't quite gave a slight air of disappointment. 'The Descendants' may not say much new or deep, for a film with heavy and complicated themes this will disappoint some, part of me thought in places things could have gone into more detail. A few parts came over as being too convenient in occurrence and resolution. Perhaps there could have been less narration, which actually isn't that irritating or over-used but the film would have worked without it.However, 'The Descendants' is gorgeously shot, making the most of and clearly loving the picturesque Hawaiian locations and landscapes that makes one want to book a holiday there immediately. The use of traditional Hawaiian music on the soundtrack gave the film authenticity and added a lot to the mood of the story, especially in the more melancholic elements that are enhanced by it. Payne directs with his usual wit and warmth.Payne's script is a large part of 'The Descendants' success. There is a lot of poignant pathos that does give enough depth to the melancholic element of the story, but it is balanced beautifully with a sincere honesty, thoughtfulness, glowing warmth and humorous comic elements.Admittedly the story is deliberate and it's not the most insightful or breaking-new-ground there is, but the sympathetic tackling of the heavy and complicated personal themes really strikes an emotional chord and the warmth and gentle tone make it interesting. The characters are written well and the father and daughter relationship has a lot of heart and one of the film's biggest strengths. George Clooney gives one of his finest performances in a challenging role that he brings a lot of layers to. The performance of Shailene Woodley is similarly among the year's best yet criminally overlooked, a very heartfelt, engaging and beyond her years turn. The rest of the cast are just as affecting (particularly Judy Greer and Beau Bridges), while there's welcome levity from Nick Krause, as one of the more rounded supporting characters, and a surprisingly good Matthew Lillard (was expecting him to jar seeing as he tends to play goofballs yet here in a less likeable role in a gentle drama).Overall, very good and could have been great with just a few tweaks. 8/10 Bethany Cox",The Descendants
2,SnoopyStyle,Good movie but not the Greatest,7,9 September 2013,"Matt King (George Clooney) is descendant from Hawaiian royalty. And he must decide on what to do with his inheritance of a large tract of land. His daughters have no respect for him. And his wife Elizabeth is on life support after a boating accident.There is something about his wife that he doesn't know at first. It is an emotional punch to the gut. This does lead to a very powerful scene at the end. Clooney stretches out his acting skills that he doesn't usually use. He is at times a pathetic loser. Director/writer Alexander Payne is pulling something out of this that George is not known for. For a long time now, he's been this suave sexiest man alive. He isn't that guy here. It's both good and bad. It's nice to see him stretch. But it's disconcerting to see him against type. Shailene Woodley does a good turn as an opinionated teen.",The Descendants
3,Hitchcoc,Clooney Undone,8,24 May 2012,"This is a movie that could have been made maudlin with the wrong approach. It's a story of redemption. It's unpredictable and absorbing. Clooney must deal with his comatose, brain dead wife, who has injured herself seriously through her own recklessness. The interesting thing is that they didn't have the greatest relationship in the first place. He is a workaholic and has ignored her. He can't go back and probably wouldn't, given a chance. He has two daughters, both of whom are little whack jobs, filled with Angst and self-centeredness. When Clooney finds out the man with whom she has had a tried affair, he goes ballistic. At first this is really about him and his own hurt, but he is heading down the road to destruction and had better watch himself. The family goes on a trip, basically to find the other man and they bring along a ding dong boyfriend of one of the daughters. He is thick as a brick but we find, as with most people, something lies beneath the surface. Clooney has a dignified insensitivity where this guy is right out there. I just can't believe that some people found this boring. It's a tour de force for Clooney, one of America's treasures. It shows that in life there are no simple answers and things don't always get tied up with a ribbon. This movie haunts me because it's the kind of thing that could happen to anyone. There is a subplot about some incredible real estate, and that becomes the center point in Clooney's longings to do right. See this. It's moving and salient.",The Descendants
4,Prismark10,Trouble in paradise,8,22 May 2018,"The Descendants is a bittersweet tragedy set in the supposedly idyllic paradise of Hawaii.Matt King (George Clooney) makes it clear that Hawaii is far from a paradise, just like other Americans they have to work hard for a living. Well Matt does not have to, he is descended from Hawaiian royalty. He and his cousins own vast acres of land which has provided them with a sizable income without needing to work.However Matt learned the value of work from his father, he is a Trust lawyer and is the sole trustee of the family land which is due to be sold off soon in advance of the changes in Hawaiian land law. Matt and his cousins will become very wealthy as their land is on the verge to be sold to developers.Matt also finds out that his wife is in a coma in the hospital after a speedboat accident. He now is in charge of his youngest daughter who is getting off the rails, needs to get to his eldest daughter who has gone off the rails when the doctor tells Matt that his wife will not recover.As the family prepares to say their final goodbyes, Matt finds out that his wife was cheating on him and he learns the true value of the land he is dealing with. Simply The Descendants is an intelligent film that deals with grief and relationships. Clooney anchors the film but it is director Alexander Payne who gets a great performance out of his actors.",The Descendants
5,mark.waltz,So much greatness hidden amongst the vulgarity.,4,2 November 2012,"It is one thing to have a bunch of juveniles cursing in a movie, but when the adult who is supposed to guide these adolescents (one pre-teen, another mid-teen) starts acting like a High School aged kid himself is where I begin to draw the line in today's ""modern"" cinema.I started off loving this family drama where busy dad George Clooney finds out the sad truth about his comatose wife from their foul-mouthed teenaged daughter who wouldn't know respect if it hopped up on her surfboard in their lush Hawaiian home. The fact that Clooney didn't even make an attempt to discipline her in front of the young (and equally crude) daughter made him seem like a real wimp, the place where the fault for these kid's behavior lies. Yes, I think he had every right to know the truth about his wife's infidelities as she lies brain dead in a hospital room with only days left to physically live. But the way he handles it with confronting the other man is something so immature it seemed like something I would have seen in my ultra-clicky high school. Cursing certainly does not offend me when it has a purpose but here, it seems that the only purpose it has is to show today's troubled youth that it is OK to swear in anger at your parents and to curse your comatose mother without really understanding why things happened the way they did. The script expects the audience to give the family sympathy within their bad behavior no matter how justified it seems.If anything good came out of all of this it was the calm after the storm where forgiveness takes over all the immature actions up until that point. But taking the old adage ""Children should be seen and not heard"" and moving it into the opposite extreme I think is a bad precedent to take. In this era where the media is showing children in a dysfunctional light, attempting to make the decisions in the families and blaming their parents for everything, the film is doing a disservice to families who are trying to instill old fashioned values with (un)common sense. I would hope that after Clooney resolves these dysfunctional issues, he gets his kids into cursing anonymous.",The Descendants
6,nogodnomasters,"MY LOVE, MY FRIEND, MY PAIN, MY JOY...",9,22 April 2019,"There is 90 seconds of film where George Clooney is not on the screen. But don't worry, he narrates for us so we don't forget he is in the film. His wife Elizabeth (Patricia Hastie) has a boating accident we don't get to see because Clooney wasn't there. She is in a coma and is going to die. Clooney has been so involved with his job (he has a big deal in the works) that he has alienated himself from his family. Now he is attempting to reconnect with his two daughters, the older of which has harsh feelings for her mother.The story develops to a point where Elizabeth's coma becomes almost secondary. Clooney's deal involves all of his cousins and a realtor Clooney would rather not deal with for personal reasons. In order to help her cope, the older daughter Alexandra (Shailene Woodley) has a boyfriend (Nick Krause) who hangs out with her during this interim.The movie is a drama, but the dysfunctional family provides for light humor and some dark humor to keep the film from getting too heavy. Good acting. Well written and directed. Film is really great if you like the color blue: blue skies, blue water, blue Hawaiian shirts...and Clooney.F-bomb, no sex or nudity.",The Descendants
7,kosmasp,Ascendants then?,9,30 April 2012,"It's not only George Clooney who's delivering, it's every other actor in this too. The script has a major part in this, because it does actually convey and portray the characters in it with some strong components. Like the guy/character played by Krause. He's mad funny to the viewer, but the character does not realize that. He's not saying those things, because he wants to be funny, he's just genuine.Having said that, there is also drama to be found in here, but mostly this is light fare and it suits the movie well. It's also nice to see the guy who became famous with Scream back on track with a really good role on his hands (yes he can act! Shame they wouldn't let him do it that often. Surely Wing Commander cannot be seen as a further example of that). Cinematography and direction are great, so I can only recommend this to you as have quite a few others here :o)",The Descendants
8,lee_eisenberg,no rest for the weary,10,12 April 2013,"""The Descendants"" looks at rectification amid tragedy. George Clooney's Hawaii land baron has no choice but to reconsider his relationship with his daughters after his wife suffers a boating accident that leaves her comatose. To me, it seems like the plot is a metaphor for any society: it might seem fun and idyllic, but there's always something unpleasant beneath the surface. In Hawaii's case, it looks like a paradise, but the indigenous Hawaiians are now a minority in their own land. (this is just conjecture, so don't quote me) But anyway, it's a really good movie. In addition to fine acting and direction, the ukulele music moves the action along perfectly. It's one that you should see. I haven't experienced anything like what the movie depicts so I can't comment on its authenticity, but at face value it's really good. I've liked every one of Alexander Payne's movies so far, and this continues the streak.",The Descendants
9,jboothmillard,The Descendants,9,31 July 2012,"I saw bit and pieces of trailers and reviews for this film; I was certainly interested to see what it would actually be about, especially because of the great reviews by critics and the award accolades, from Oscar and Golden Globe nominated director Alexander Payne (Election, About Schmidt, Sideways). Basically in Honolulu lives lawyer Matt King (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated George Clooney) who controls his family's trust that own 25,000 pristine acres of land in Kauai, but this trust will be lost in seven years, so the King family plan to sell the land to be developed by native Don Holitzer. But before this deal can go through Matt suffers the devastation of his wife Elizabeth (Patricia Hastie) having a serious boating accident and has gone into a coma, and this is also hard for his two daughters, ten year old Scottie (Amara Miller) and seventeen year old Alexandra 'Alex' (Golden Globe nominated Shailene Woodley). While Elizabeth is in comatose in Queen's Hospital, Matt has to listen to complaints about Scottie's inappropriate behaviour in school and destructive behaviour from Alex, but he is most devastated to be told by the doctor that his wife will never wake from the coma, and by her wishes she will be taken off life support soon. He knows that Scottie will be really upset, so he only tells Alex this sad news, and she finally reveals a truth that she has been hiding before the accident, that Elizabeth was having an affair, and only family friends the Mitchells, Kai (Mary Birdsong) and Mark (Rob Huebel) may know the man who she was with. They do confirm that the mystery man is named Brian Speer (Matthew Lillard), and the Kings find out that he is a real estate agent, so Matt has decided to find him on vacation in Kauai, not just to confront him, but to tell him that Elizabeth will die, to give him the chance to say his goodbyes. After Matt tells all the other friends and family that care about Elizabeth, he, his daughters and Alex's slacker friend Sid (Nick Krause) travel to find Brian Speer, and while jogging on the beach he is surprised to coincidentally pass and recognise the man, and he sees that he is renting a beach cottage that happens to be owned by Matt's cousin Hugh (Beau Bridges). Hugh tells him that Brian is Don Holitzer's brother in law, and he stands to gain a lot of commission from the King family's land if it is sold and developed, and Matt also gets the opportunity to meet Brian's wife Julie (Judy Greer) pretending just to be a passer-by who happens to know people her husband does. Eventually Matt decides to go to the cottage and meet Brian face to face, bringing Alex with him, and after getting his daughter to distract Julie, he introduces himself as Elizabeth's wife, and they talk with nothing held back about the affair, and he confesses that while she loved him, he did not feel any true passion for her, as he cares for his wife and family more, and he apologises for the hurt. After they have left and returned home Matt meets with many of his cousins who have voted in majority for Don Holitzer to take the family's 25,000 acres, but as the sole trustee he refuses to sign the form and to find a different solution, and he ignores that the cousins may take legal action for this decision. It comes to the last day that Elizabeth will be on life support, Scottie is finally told by a consultant what is happening, and Elizabeth's parents the Thorsons, Scott (Robert Forster) and Alice 'Tutu' (Barbara L. Southern) are there, and there is a surprise when it is not Brian that shows up, but his wife Julie, who is now aware of the affair he had with Elizabeth. Julie forgives Elizabeth, despite wanting to hate her for the deceit, Matt tenderly kisses his wife for the final goodbye, and Alex and Scottie say their goodbyes too, and Elizabeth is finally taken off life support, and later the three of them scatter the ashes in the ocean off Waikiki. The last part sees Matt, Alex and Scottie all quiet and close together as just curl up on the coach to watch March of the Penguins together, sharing the quilt from Elizabeth's deathbed. Also starring Michael Ontkean as Cousin Milo and Matt Corboy as Cousin Ralph. Clooney is usually handsome and cool, here he is rugged, grey and uncool with baggy bits and his shirts tucked in, but that makes him all the more likable, and of course sympathetic in his grief, and many of the supporting cast members do well also, such as Lillard as the other man, Woodley as the opinionated teenage daughter, and even Krause as the amusing sometimes dim-witted and apathetic young man. I'll be honest in saying that I was not full interested in the landownership storyline, but the father who sees himself as the second-hand parent trying to connect with his daughters in the hard times, the husband finding and having words with the man who slept with his wife, and finally trying to find the strength to let her go, all of this creates genuine emotion, but there are also the amusing moments to cheer you up, it is a fantastic comedy drama. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year and Best Editing, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture – Drama, and it was nominated for Best Screenplay. George Clooney was number 72 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 7 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols. Very good!",The Descendants
10,rmax304823,Domestic Drama.,5,13 October 2012,"I like George Clooney. He's a likable guy. And I enjoy his being on screen. But I'll have to make these comments short because I was unable to sit through ""The Descendants."" I take it from some of the reviews that there were moments of comedy in the film but they must not have taken place during the first thirty-five minutes that I watched. Clooney's wife suffers a mortal injury in a boat race and he's told that she's dying. Two tragedies -- boat accident and the revelation that the injury is fatal -- in the first ten minutes.Clooney gets his two daughters together at home. One is about seven and sensitive, the other is a nubile teen who is a marginal alcoholic. Neither gets along with him particularly well. The older daughter tearfully informs Clooney that he's so stupid he didn't know his wife was having an affair. And he really DIDN'T.I don't know how most men would handle such a revelation but, given that his wife is now a vegetable and rapidly losing turgor, I would get drunk and shrug it off as a not especially important datum. But Clooney goes berserk at the news and runs in his zoris down the street to the house of some friends, demanding from them the identity of the cuckold, panting all the time.That's about when I quit. I have enough pain in my own life. The spray from the shower head is beginning to feel as if it's saturated with nematocytes. Basta, I say. If Clooney wants to spend an hour and a half rolling around in anger, frustration, and despair, that's his business.His mellifluous narration and the picturesque locations with their rain-laden clouds, and not even his own up-to-par performance and a pretty good one from the nubile teen, can lift this movie out of its melancholia. I can't think of any reason to watch it unless you want to see somebody who's even worse off than you are. And even that piddling pleasure is circumscribed by the fact that he's a rich lawyer living in paradise.",The Descendants
11,Tweekums,A fine drama with quite a few laughs,9,16 April 2014,"When Elizabeth King is seriously injured in a boating accident her husband, Matt, is left looking after his ten year old daughter, Scottie, and things aren't going too well as he doesn't really know how to be a father. Then when the doctors inform Matt that Elizabeth is going to die he removes his elder daughter, seventeen year old Alex, from boarding school hoping she might be able to help but if anything she makes things harder she tells him a secret about her mother that Matt never suspected; she had discovered that her mother was having an affair. Matt decides he must at least talks to the man and sets about looking for him.Matt and his family live in Hawaii on the island of Oahu where he is an attorney; he is also the trustee of 25,000 acres of pristine land on the island of Kauai and a change in the law means it must be sold within seven years; most of his cousins want him to sell it to a local developer but he is has yet to decide. It does however give him a reason to go to Kauai when he learns that his wife's lover is visiting that island.Given that this film is effectively about a man and his daughters waiting for his wife to die it is surprisingly funny; frequently laugh out loud funny. This is done in a way that is naturally amusing rather than forced situations. It is also quite touching and doesn't shy away from the promised ending to give us a 'miracle cure'. The cast do a fine job; George Clooney does great as Matt and Shailene Woodley and Amara Miller do fine jobs as Alex and Scottie. Nick Krause, who plays Alex's friend Sid, is hilarious in many of his scenes without making the character annoying which could easily have happened. The subplot involving the land provided a nice excuse to show even more glorious Hawaiian scenery. Overall I must say this film was a real delight; the comedy and tragedy were nicely balanced and the story moved along at a gentle pace without being at all boring. The only possible criticism I can think of is that some viewers who might like the story might be offended by the swearing, of which there is quite a lot however if that doesn't bother you I highly recommend this film.",The Descendants
12,tavm,The Descendants was a fine drama directed by Alexander Payne and starring George Clooney,10,18 April 2012,"Just watched this drama with my mom on a Netflix disc. George Clooney plays a lawyer in Hawaii who has a comatose wife. He discovers something about her from his eldest daughter that leads him to question why certain things happened when she was still active. That's all I'll say about that except that Alexander Payne has directed quite a touching drama that deserved the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay that he wrote. There's also some pretty good supporting performances by Beau Bridges, Robert Forster, and Judy Greer, the latter being quite wonderfully surprising to me since I usually think of her a comedic actress. In summary, I highly recommend The Descendants.",The Descendants

It also shows how they shall coalesce ultimately when the chips are down.Robert Forster, as the dying woman's father, has some acting stealing scenes as the hard driven materialistic person who only can think what a neglectful Clooney should have done and about the proposed sale of the land.A terrific film with fine performances by all.",The Descendants

I've always been able to take or leave George Clooney so that I have seen perhaps half of the films in which he has appeared but this time he showed definite signs of actually acting rather than relying on looks and charm. Alas, the film promises more than it delivers as if director Payne was saying to the audience 'sure, we meant to explore the issues of moral compasses but somehow between pre-production and shooting we mislaid our own. Shailene Woodley has rightly been praised for her performance but it seems that her volte face from angry, sullen, rebellious teenager to mature father-supporter is too abrupt and could have used a tad more finesse. I certainly enjoyed it and was moved to tears once or twice whilst watching it but I'm not sure it would stand further viewings.",The Descendants

18,Boba_Fett1138,"Human drama, brought pleasantly lightly.",8,24 January 2012,"This was not a movie I was absolutely in love with but it still was one that I really liked and could appreciate for all it did.You could really call this movie a human drama. With this I mean that the movie has plenty of drama in it but in a very realistic and sensible way. These are all very human characters, dealing with some very human things, in a very human way.And thing that the movie also has definitely going for it, is that it doesn't ever tell its story in a too heavy handed way. This could had so easily turned into a melodramatic picture but instead it picks a far more interesting approach by making things more light and almost comical at times. This also makes the movie its story and all its developments a surprise, for most part of the movie. It cleverly avoids all of the clichés, through its great writing and storytelling abilities by Alexander Payne, who has really mastered the genre.Really still the biggest key, as to why this movie works, are its characters. They are all not without their flaws and weaknesses, which makes them very realistic ones, first of all things. But all manage to become some very likable characters, despite of all their weaknesses. You also really start to feel and understand their feelings and why they do certain things the way they do and respond in certain ways. This is a real accomplishment, since you have to remember that this goes for basically each and every character and there are of course a whole bunch of very different characters in this movie.Alexander Payne has always been a director that knows how to get the best out of his actors. And this movie really is no exception to that. Really, once you start thinking about it, George Clooney is a guy that has always maintained his own acting style and therefore often seems to be playing the same guy over and over again (not that is a complaint though. I still really like him as an actor). But still I can say with almost absolute certainty that he has never been better in any other movie before. Also truly impressive was the unknown Shailene Woodley, as the oldest daughter. Lets hope we will get to see many more great things of her, in the coming future.A great watch and you definitely shouldn't be scared off by its heavy and serious subjects.8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Descendants

Clooney gives the performance of his career in an Oscar-worthy turn as the patriarch of a Hawaiian family in crises: a family tragedy – the impending death of his unfaithful wife – and a highly profitable real estate deal brokered pending for a huge familial payoff are the main set pieces in Alexander Payne's brilliant adaptation of Kaui Hart Hemmings' novel (co-scripted with Nat Faxon & Jim Rash). A superb ensemble cast with noteworthy work by newcomer Woodley as the eldest daughter give a well-toned balance to both the drama and comic underpinnings of the film's strengths in divvying up both with equal parts perfection blended with pathos and piquancy.

20,neil-476,Excellent intimate drama with some humour,9,1 February 2012,"Lawyer Matt King (George Clooney) is from a large old Hawaiian family. When his wife ends up in a coma following a power boat accident, Matt ends up having to come to terms with parenting his 10- and 17-year old daughters, both of whom prove to have, let us say, difficult areas to negotiate. At the same time, as Trustee of a family trust, he has to deal with the disposition of a large parcel of valuable land. And then he discovers that his wife was having an affair at the time of the accident. And then it becomes clear that she is not going to come out of the coma...Central to everything is Matt's struggle to come to terms with his personal tragedy, to deal with the needs of his daughters, to do the right thing by his family and his wife's circle of friends, and to seek out his wife's lover to give him the opportunity to pay final respects to her (which, itself has unexpected consequences). The events of this film are small in the overall scheme of things, but large in the lives of the main characters (""characters"" is not a fair word - these are people). This is a gentle, adult drama, not without its humorous moments, in which characters do develop, but only to a small extent - rather like real life, in fact. It deals with adult issues, does not come to any glib conclusions, and does so with (occasionally profound) emotion, but never sentimentality.Clooney shows, again, that he is a class act. I don't think this is his best performance, as some are saying (I thought he was better in Ides Of March), but it is an impressive lead performance holding the movie together as Matt copes - not very well, but probably better than I could - with holding things together. He is helped by some excellent supporting performances, notably (as others have pointed out by Shailene Woodley, physically poised on the brink of adulthood, herself coping with the huge secret of her mother's infidelity, and conveying all the strength and fragility of a 17-year old forced into being grown up before she is ready for it.I thoroughly enjoyed this film.",The Descendants
21,evanston_dad,Where's the Alexander Payne I've Come to Know and Love?,5,15 January 2012,"The point of ""The Descendants,"" as the movie's thudding opening voice over narration tells us, is that even people in Hawaii can be miserable. Over the next two hours, the film makes this point pretty convincingly. Unfortunately, it made me miserable watching it.The quirky comedic vibe that has infused virtually every other Alexander Payne film -- the same vibe that has made something special of his movies and a big fan out of me -- is painfully absent in this gloomy film about a dysfunctional family coming to terms with the death of its wife and mother. Payne tries for it, but the result is a dud. The movie is, therefore, somewhat of a slog, morbid, depressing and slow.But those qualities might be easier to tolerate if the movie was good. Sadly, and surprisingly, it's not. It's not well written at all, a criticism I would never level at other Payne movies. The characters and situations don't make any sense, no matter how valiantly some of the actors (and there are good ones) try. George Clooney has been wildly overrated for his performance; it's simply a repeat of the morose, sad characters he's been playing for a while now, and we're expected to see greatness in his performance mostly because he allows some added gray in his hair and a few more lines around his eyes to subdue his movie star looks. But the actress who plays his oldest daughter, Shailene Woodley, is a standout, even though her character is one of the weakest written. Introduced to us as an out-of-control wild child, she seemingly makes amends with her father overnight and becomes his right-hand man, resolving without any effort one of the film's biggest dramatic conflicts. There's also a lovely performance from Judy Greer as the wife of the man with whom Clooney's wife was having an affair, but Payne undermines her performance at the last minute by abruptly and oddly disposing of her character in a scene that I think was meant to be funny (the fact that I'm not sure points to the movie's problems).There are moments that succeed in wringing tears, but they do it in a cheap way. Anyone would well up at the sight of a little girl being told her mother is going to die; it doesn't take especially good writing or directing to make that situation an emotional one.It displeases me greatly to have to say so, but I found almost nothing to recommend about ""The Descendants."" I guess every good filmmaker is allowed to stumble once in a while.Grade: C",The Descendants
22,ferguson-6,"Mahalo, On the Brink",8,19 November 2011,"Greetings again from the darkness. Ahh, finally! I was beginning to wonder if 2011 was going to produce a film that I could whole-heartedly recommend to both cinephiles and casual movie goers. Writer/director Alexander Payne has delivered a gem. And in a giant surprise, it stars George Clooney as a guy going through real life stress, and in his own words, ""just trying to keep his head above water"".Clooney plays Matt King, a lawyer in Hawaii who is also the trustee of a family land trust. Only this is no typical family land trust. It involves thousands of pristine Kauai acreage that has been left untouched for hundreds of years. The endless stream of ""cousins"" want him to sell to a developer for hundreds of millions. The locals don't want him to sell as they believe in the spiritual nature of land, not the green backs of hotels and beachfront homes. And Matt only wishes this was his biggest problem.Matt's fun-loving wife has been injured in a speed boat accident. She is in a coma and the prognosis is not bright. She also has a living will that states no life-support, which is another of the problems Matt must face. Additionally, he must re-connect with his two daughters. See, Matt has been the workaholic attorney that has left the child-rearing to his wife. The two daughters prove to be more than a hand full for the clueless Matt. Scottie (Amana Miller) is the youngest, and is struggling with how to react to the state of her mother. Alexandra(Shailene Woodley) is off at boarding school in hopes that she can be tamed from her wild ways. These three must come together and really bond for the first time.Those three problems would be enough for any one man to handle, but Matt receives one more bit of information. Turns out his wife was having an affair at the time of her boating accident. So, ""having a bad day"" seems a little insufficient for Matt's situation. At this point, the movie takes an odd turn and almost becomes a mini-road trip movie. Matt, his two daughters and Alexandra's off-beat friend Sid (Nick Krause) take on the mission of informing friends and relatives, while also tracking down the ""other guy"".It may seem like I have given away much of the story, but in fact, all of that has been discussed in one of the trailers. What sets this film apart is how this web of stress is handled by Matt and daughters. The story is based on the novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings, and the screenplay is co-written by Payne, Nat Faxon and Jim Rash. Watching Matt as he struggles through each decision and situation makes us pull for him, even though he really isn't anything special ... he's not all that friendly or charming (a rarity for a Clooney character), and certainly no parent of the year.Alexander Payne has given us ""About Schmidt"" and it's been 7 years since his last feature, ""Sideways"". Both of those films and this one give us a character on the brink ... full crisis mode. Some of his characters lash out (Paul Giamatti in Sideways), while others turn to introspection (Jack Nicholson in About Schmidt). Here, Clooney's character seems to have many decisions to make, but the biggest one is reconnecting with his own soul and being the kind of man he needs to be, for himself, his daughters and the sacred land.The characters and story are so effective that you will find yourself tearing up in the same scene where you laugh out loud. And that will happen more than once. Few filmmakers can walk the high wire between comedy and drama better than Payne. We connect with these character as they are real people ... we KNOW these people. And we know excellent filmmaking when we see it.",The Descendants
23,anaconda-40658,Descends Into Greatness.,10,14 September 2015,"The Descendants (2011): Dir: Alexander Payne / Cast: George Clooney, Shailene Woodley, Amara Miller, Nick Krause, Matthew Lillard: Alexander Payne is a director of incredible insight into the trials of those who know better but will no doubt embrace their better nature after the storm. He proves this with masterpieces such as Election, About Schmidt and Sideways. Here, at last, is another masterpiece. This one regards generations and what is passed down to our children. George Clooney delivers one of his greatest performances as a husband and father who is involved in land management, and currently holds the controlling shares of massive land controlled by his extended family. They want him to sell while his daughters want him to keep it. Central plot regards his wife in a boating accident that places her in a coma on life support. Then comes the news that she was having an affair. Clooney balances grief, frustration, anger, and the need to understand and deal with his daughters. He treks them to Hawaii in search on his wife's beau, a real estate salesman, and Payne handles this with blunt truth and payoff. Shailene Woodley plays older daughter picked up at boarding school where her drunken behaviour harbours resentment. Amara Miller plays younger daughter whose mind is impressionable. Nick Strause steals scenes as Woodley's boyfriend who often speaks before he thinks. Matthew Lillard plays the guilty male whom had the affair with Clooney's wife. Great film regarding the scars left by others, and our attempts to heal them for the good of those whom depend on it. Score: 10 / 10",The Descendants
24,FlashCallahan,I wanna see his face....,10,29 January 2012,"There is a lot of disregard for this film and a lot for Clooney, and it really put me off wanting to see this film.But if you disregard the disregard (ha ha) you will be awarded with one of the most fruitful, funny, and touching films made in a very long time.Clooney plays Matt King, a lawyer who owns a lot of Hawaian land thanks to a legacy (hence the title). To cut a long story short, his wife is in a major boating accident, has to look after his daughters, and finds out his wife was having an affair.All this with the added pressure of his cousins wanting to sell the beloved land.Time for a road trip to meet the other man in his wife's life.....Clooney owns this film, as he is in every scene almost and really puts you into Matts shoes. Every emotion is shown here, and even little things, such as the moment where he makes uncomfortable eye contact with a man on a plane, his performance is perfect.The rest of the cast are great to, especially Forster and Woodley, as they add a bit of life to the film. Payne has really handled Woodleys character well, because when we first meet her, you think that this is just another spoilt rich girl who hates her dad because he's not there.But is could not be further from the truth and it's clear that Payne is having a ball pulling the rug from under her feet. And it's her revelation that really turns the film on it's head.Payne mixes the bitter with the sweet, and for every heart wrenching moment, there is a scene or a line that is literally laugh out loud funny.All in all, it's a great movie about finding yourself, and realising that life is too short and making every second count.The film finishes perfectly,with three people sitting on a couch eating Ice Cream. It sounds boring, but the feeling of togetherness in the most simplest of scenarios, is perfect.",The Descendants
25,phd_travel,Surprisingly unsentimental - good but not great,7,27 January 2012,"Quite a few surprises here. The movie is watchable and for unexpected reasons. First of all it's not a soapy drama - it is deliberately not emotional. In fact the hospital scenes at the end are completely unsentimental. Maybe because the dying wife is just so distant and an unsympathetic character. Secondly it is fascinating to look at the life of old rich Hawaiians, the Kings - George Clooney and his family (the Descendants).The family drama consists of a husband dealing with his children after his wife goes into a coma and the learning of her infidelity. The side story is a dealing with a valuable piece of land that has been in his extended family for generations.George's character is interesting in his realness especially stinginess driving a small Japanese car when he has lots of money and living in a shabby home with a dirty pool. There are some plot weaknesses. It seems unrealistic that he would go to another island to look for his wife's lover to tell him to say goodbye to her. I know he was curious but it just seemed far fetched.There are some unexpectedly funny moments of dialog from the daughter's boyfriend Nick Krause who like Thomas Haden Church in Sideways says inappropriate things. The father in law's nastiness is quite well written too.Photography is nice - it doesn't try to give you picture perfect views all the time or perfect weather. It has a realistic on location feel.Performances are good but not great. No one is quite Oscar worthy. George is quite good at looking frazzled and quite believable as a father. But he doesn't have much range to show. Shailene Woodley as his older daughter is suitably sullen but she is a bit beady looking and not appealing. Not quite worthy of nominations. The younger daughter isn't quite cute enough. Matthew Lillard is a strange choice to be the lover with his comical demeanor. Beau Bridges is quite suitable as a cousin of George.Overall it's no Sideways but it has it's funny moments and it's a transporting experience to the Hawaiian islands. As a family drama it isn't that emotionally involving but still definitely worth a watch.",The Descendants
26,gradyharp,An Extended Soap Opera,7,17 March 2012,"Yes, the story is worth telling (from a book by Kaui Hart Hemmings) and the study of contemporary family life with all its flaws is commendable, and yes, George Clooney submerges himself in a role that is anything but his usual romance hero roles, but it seems that the ideas presented could have been condensed into an hour long movie for television instead of spread over 2 hours of interminable Hawaiian music backed vistas of the islands. The film appeals to a lot of people and that is satisfying to note that movie goers care enough about end of life issues and flawed parenting skills to support the ideas buried in this extravaganza.Matt King (George Clooney though looking unkempt and sloppy is solid in a an introspective and subdued performance) is a real estate attorney who happens to be the controlling descendant in a family whose ancestors date back to the days of Hawaiian kings: the family owns a large parcel of land they plan to sell to become instantly wealthy, a move the Hawaiians find disturbing as the influx of commercialism would destroy the native beauty of their island. Matt's wife Elizabeth is critically injured in a boating accident and is in a coma, not only affecting Matt emotionally but also pointing up the fact that he must assume full parental duties in coping with his two rather outrageous daughters - Alexandra (Shailene Woodley in a career making brilliant role) and chubby troublesome Scottie (Amara Miller). He brings Alex home from the boarding school she has been attending in an attempt to make her less sociopathic (she has fought seriously with her mother, drinks to excess and behaves badly) but she come with her loopy friend Sid (Nick Krause, another fine performance) who ends up being not unlike Matt. Alex tells Matt the Elizabeth was having an affair, a note that shocks Matt and sets him on a quest to discover who gained his wife's attention. When he discovers the boyfriend was a married real estate broker Brian Speer (Matthew Lillard) whose wife Julie (Judy Greer) Matt meets on the beach the attempt to bring closure to this portion of Matt's life, as Elizabeth is taken off life support machines, opens windows of communication between Matt and his daughters, with Sid who isn't as loopy as Matt perceived, with Elizabeth's parents (Robert Forster and Barbara L. Southern who embodies Alzheimer's Disease well), and most of all with himself. He gains courage to respect his heritage of Hawaiian land, dismisses his family's greed (from which Brian Speer would have benefited), and becomes an enlightened and emotionally more mature man.THE DESCENDANTS is a worthy film with a few good performances and a star turn for Clooney and Woodley, but oh, turn off that interminable Hawaiian music that drowns the story like a tsunami!

27,zetes,Mediocre,6,20 November 2011,"Alexander Payne returns to feature filmmaking with his first film since 2004's Sideways - for my money the best film of that year. I was hugely disappointed in this one, unfortunately. I guess I did hate his first two films, Citizen Ruth and Election, but I hated them because I found them mean-spirited. The Descendants is far from mean-spirited, so I didn't hate it like I did those two. It has a decent set-up and an interesting perspective. It's disappointing that it couldn't accomplish anything with them. George Clooney stars as a busy lawyer who has to take care of his two daughters exclusively after his wife went into a coma. Soon enough he learns that his wife is not going to come out of the coma, and his oldest daughter (Shailene Woodley, who gives the film's best performance), upon hearing the tragic news, reveals that the reason for the animosity she has shown to her mother is that she caught her cheating on her father. Clooney is doubly devastated, and decides to seek out his wife's paramour (Matthew Lillard). So, I haven't yet mentioned the biggest twist in this story: it takes place in Hawaii. So, yeah, right, that's not that big a twist is it? I mean, Clooney explicitly tells us through voice-over the second the film has opened that the story's Hawaiian setting will bear no effect on this story, that people in Hawaii live lives just like everyone else. So why do I feel like my four block trek through the snowflakes the size of rock salt to get to the theater feels like more of a tragedy than Clooney and his family losing their wife and mother? The film's biggest flaw is that Payne does treat Hawaii like a paradise. He's absolutely obsessed with its beauty, often stopping for pillow shots of gorgeous vistas or flowers. The film is scored with Hawaiian folk music, which is never not sweet and relaxing. Perhaps its impossible not to make Hawaii look like paradise, but it would help if Payne weren't so enamored of it. That isn't the film's only flaw however. Another big one is the character of Sid (Nick Krause), Woodley's doofus buddy, who tags along everywhere. He seems there at first to provide some comic relief, but he's just too stupid and insensitive to be real. The scene where he makes fun of Woodley's Alzheimer's suffering grandmother is ridiculous - no one is this moronically insensitive. And, even if they were, wouldn't you think that Clooney and even Woodley would be so fed up with them they'd never talk to him again? He only remains in the film because Payne wants to pull the rug out from under our expectations later in the picture by letting him reveal a personal secret, but the revelation is silly: if he himself had recently suffered tragedy, would he be so insensitive in the earlier sequences? He's just a very poorly conceived plot device (oh, but did the art-house audience cackle every time he said anything! Ugh!). Also, the younger daughter (Amara Miller) is too often used as a source of comedy, too. She's too cutesy, and her lines come off as too written. When she finally finds out about her mother's fate, late in the picture, the writers have no more use for her and I don't even think she gets a line. All that said, it's not anywhere near an awful film, just a misjudged one. Clooney is fine, and he gets at least one killer scene late in the picture. I have to admit I did tear up a little at the end. Beau Bridges and Robert Forster have good supporting roles. And, yes, Hawaii still looks beautiful.",The Descendants
28,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: The Descendants,9,24 January 2012,"Newly minted Best Picture (Drama) at this year's Golden Globes, along with George Clooney being awarded the Best Actor (Drama) award, The Descendants is Alexander Payne's latest film since Sideways, based upon the novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings. Dealing with the central character of Matt King (Clooney) as the trustee of his extended family's trust of thousands of acres of untouched land on the island of Kaua'i, Hawaii, Clooney puts in a commanding performance that deals with one man's plight on many fronts, from his children, his wife, his relatives and having to make tough decisions that will affect the lives of his kindred.As with Payne's films, the challenges that stand in the protagonist's way are what make the film highly engaging, and Clooney drops his film star demeanour to play the everyday man who faces issues that aren't too far fetched, discovering that his now comatose wife Elizabeth (Patricia Hastie) has been cheating on him, and trying to reconnect with estranged daughter Alex (Shailene Woodley) and 10 year old Scottie (Amara Miller) since he's a dad who's seldom at home and seen. And as if matters of the family cannot get anymore complicated, here comes the extended family of cousins and just about everyone related to the King real estate who have to decide, ultimately by Matt himself, how to best sell off their inherited land in order to maximize their profits, with a deadline to boot.With the multiple narrative threads dealing at a microscopic emotional level - trying hard to come to terms with a cheating spouse where you know you've drawn the shortest possible end of the stick given the state of the other half, and having a teenage daughter who doesn't quite understand you, they provide that grounding to make it easy to identify with Matt King the man who's really quite down on his luck on family matters. The plot threads expand to his near obsession to want to discover with whom his wife has been cheating with, and to bear the brunt of an incessantly sarcastic father-in-law who doesn't take her daughter's comatose state all too kindly.But it's not all doom, gloom and filled with negative emotions here, as the film does have its fair share of lighter moments courtesy of characters like Alexandra's insensitive loud mouthed friend Sid (Nick Krause) who comes along for the road trip of sorts, though almost always punctuated with that tinge of inevitable sadness in the air. Moments of poetic justice also makes you want to whoop for joy, although you tend to weigh in on these moments and make you think - would you want to maximize benefits for those in your family, or for selfish reasons choose not to remotely reward someone who had done you a great wrong. Such is the tussle and wrangle Matt has to deal with, and makes The Descendants one really topsy- turvy emotional ride, which on one hand one wants to appear magnanimous, while on the other having to suppress the urge to just punch out.And Clooney deserves his award for making Matt King so believable, junking his glamorous self for something far more affable at first, before the problems start to pile, each with a deadline of its own, and wondering when he would crack under undue pressure, emotionally and physically. Sharing perfect daughter-father relationship chemistry with Clooney is Shailene Woodley who in my opinion is an up and coming young actress to look out for, showcasing a wide range of emotions here, and a scene which I thought brought out her best when her character got broken the news of her mom's condition.Alexander Payne crafts a meaningful, dramatic film that questions whether we should let the truth be always told, or to allow whatever the version it is in to pass, and to seek to forgive others even when we're wronged. And he deftly handles once again a protagonist who is put in a dilemma with monumental tasks to tackle, although you know they'd somehow converge together toward the end given the web of relationships that exists. Primed to be a firm contender for Best Picture come Oscar season soon, I'm quite certain this is a winner in its own way and doesn't need a golden statue to reaffirm that. Highly recommended!",The Descendants
29,christopher-underwood,Laugh out loud in places but this is pretty bleak along the way.,8,25 February 2020,"I recall watching this upon its theatrical release and having mixed feeling, although it left me feeling it was a rather jolly affair. Loved it this time around but it is not very jolly. Tragi-comedy, I guess I would describe it and although the main thrust with the pending land deal is not at all interesting, the interplay between the characters and their development is brilliant. At the start all is something of a mess in the Clooney household and things change. Things may not become particularly any less messy but we learn to love the characters as they all seem to learn to live with each other in some sort of harmony.

31,StevePulaski,Descending from an unlikely world,10,28 November 2011,"""Paradise can go f*** itself."" - George Clooney, The Descendants.This is my introduction to director Alexander Payne's work, and hopefully, it will spawn many more in years to come. The Descendants is a non-sugarcoated, honest, and a realistic view of society held together with captivating performances of all ages, incredible dialog, and direction that holds together up until the final shot which some may not expect.The story follows Matt King (Clooney), a man living in Hawaii with two kids; a ten year old troublemaker named Scottie (Miller) and a seventeen year old rebel named Alexandra (Woodley). Lately, Matt has been under and uncanning amount of stress. His wife is in the hospital after being involved in a boating accident. She is now rendered comatose, and Matt is forced to look after his ten year old, before calling in his seventeen year old to help him out.On top of this, Matt is a very wealthy Realtor, trying to shy away from the luxury that his money can buy so his girls can grow up and not be spoiled and selfish. Problem is they developed those traits without the money. Matt is inches away from signing away 25,000 acres of land on Hawaii's island of Kaua'i he garnered from his royal ancestors. Doing this will make him wealthier and he has been contemplating this decision without rest until his wife is in the hospital.When things can't seem to get any worse, Alexandra drops a bombshell on her father that his wife was cheating on him before the accident. Matt is shocked, outraged, and demanding to find the man behind his wife's infidelity. Clooney is astounding, and he proves to us why he is one of the best actors in the business today. He drifts believably into anger, sorrow, frustration, and acceptance during all this, and plays the character of a stressed father in such a realistic fashion it's almost breathtaking.Shailene Woodley is also fantastic as Matt's daughter. She starts out as your typical daughter, but slowly morphs into a more recognizable human being rather than just a caricature, which is what most teenagers end up becoming in films like these.Hawaii serves as the co-star in the film. It's not supposed to, but it is. The reason being is the film tries to show its audience that Hawaii is no better on people than the mainlands are. Sometimes we get the impression in our heads that people in Hawaii are living the dream. The fact of the matter is, as narrated by Clooney exquisitely in the beginning, they aren't immune to sadness, their cancer isn't less deadly, and their problems any less serious.Why I'm praising The Descendants so greatly is because it's very easy to do a film like this poorly. The script is the key to a film like this, and if believability isn't reached and performances not cooperative with the material it could easily spiral into a whirlwind of clichés and mediocrity. Thankfully, The Descendants ignores that, and it showcases honesty and the ups and downs of every day life maturely and effectively. It also takes time with its character so we're introduced, and the cheater isn't discovered until later in the film which shows that the film had a laidback sense and is not forcing plot points down a person's throat.Many emotions are brought to the table. Seeing a good movie is never something I'm upset about, but sometimes, some films are so depressing, while well done, it makes for an iffy rewatch. The Descendants has much needed elements of humor, sad sequences, and heavy drama support all compiled into a brilliant script. And if you can really pick out the subtle messages in the ending, it's a happy one.The Descendants is fantastic, and Clooney's best work since in quite a few years. He shows us why he deserves the Oscars he's won, and why his publicity is worthy and not in any way undeserving or obtrusive. The whole thing is so pleasing and so well written even in its darkest hour that it should be the lesson to those inspiring to one day create a great, Oscar-worthy drama. For that it should be looked as a resource and not a blueprint.Starring: George Clooney, Amara Miller, Shailene Woodley, Judy Greer, Matthew Lillard, Nick Krause, and Beau Bridges.

32,blanbrn,Good emotional drama that proves secrets and life can be painful.,8,28 January 2012,"Director Alexander Payne is well known for his emotional drama as he always highlights and exposes life as tough drama that when dealing with family and loved ones it's always an emotional struggle and when secrets are uncovered life seems more painful. This picture ""The Descendants"" fits all of those descriptions, plus it's filled with plenty of laughs, tension and drama to hold viewer interest. And it has the star power with the man himself Mr. George, and a sassy direct performance from newcomer Shailene Woodley.Set in the Hawaiian islands it centers around Matt King(George Clooney)a well to do lawyer and land baron who's hit with a midlife drama his wife Elizabeth has just recently been placed in a coma on life support due to a boating accident, to complicate matters with his upcoming land sales are the parenting of his two teenage daughters. Both are scene treats the young and innocent Scottie(Amara Miller)is a delight to listen speak her young wisdom, and somewhat of an eye candy treat is watching oldest daughter Alexandra(Shailene Woodley)talk with direct and straight approach she's certainly got spunk and get up! Along the way the trio will have to come to terms about what is the right thing to do about mom and Matt will have to think again about his real estate deal especially when a hurtful secret is revealed that involves his wife Elizabeth.Overall this film is a great drama of pain, sorrow, hurt, and regret it's an emotional journey that proves in life one will have to deal with painful secrets and work thru their problems by love and by bonding with love ones. Proving in the end that those choices can be made by sticking with tradition, as that will let all be happy and at peace.",The Descendants
33,MovieAddict2016,"Well, this is the reason I liked it...",9,18 March 2012,"I think Alexander Payne is very talented, but he's more inconsistent than the popular opinion would leave one to believe. I've seen all of his films, and still think ""About Schmidt"" is the best -- ""Sideways"" was good but I never quite loved it as much as the majority of critics seemed to.The thing about ""Descendants"" is that, like About Schmidt, it essentially falls back upon one man's performance to elevate the material. And although George Clooney may not be the Robert De Niro of his generation, he's a good enough actor, and here he's pretty much perfect.I've heard a few people complain that ""nothing happens"" in this movie. That seems to be the biggest issue that reviewers on IMDb have with it, too. I dunno. Sure, nothing per se happens if you're used to big, overblown summer blockbusters...but I enjoyed this movie. A lot. I thought Payne wisely chose Clooney, and Clooney delivered a solid performance. People here seem to get hung up on the Oscars...who cares if it's ""Oscar-worthy""? You're gonna judge a movie based on that?? Eh, I dunno...I thought it was a very solid film.",The Descendants
34,DKosty123,Comedy? Not in My Book,7,8 April 2012,"A young woman out of Hawaii has written her first novel on which this film is based. While I have not read the novel the film is an interesting contrast from the normal type of entertainment. It is not often that tragedy and Hawaii are put together in the same venue. That is almost certainly one of the appeals of the novel too.The story of the movie almost exclusively involves rich people and a family that is rich. At least they are going to be rich as they are considering selling 25,000 acres of Hawaii real estate they inherited. George Clooney plays Matt King, and while he is smug, his character has reason to be. Besides being a Lawyer, he is the focus of a decision on selling the family inheritance, 25,000 acres of prime Hawaii real estate.Patricia Hastie, in one of the shorter film roles ever is shown alive briefly on water skis. The rest of the movie she is in a hospital bed in a coma. It is the result of an accident on the water skis and she has hit her head.Shailene Woodley plays oldest daughter Alexandra whose last pre-coma encounter with mom was a fight after she caught mom with her lover. Nick Krause plays Sid, the comic relief and Alexandra's boyfriend though the way he is scripted, it is kind of like having the boyfriend from another planet. Sid acts like a major jerk for the first half of the film, and does not really quite make up for it the last half of the film. Still, the very little comedy is supposed to be from him. Woodley almost steals this film from Clooney at points.Amara King in her first screen role Scottie King is good, but she is left out of the script at times.Still, a decent acting job by the youngster as the King's youngest daughter.The plot seems to unload on Matt King as everything bad a father can face almost happens. Still he manages to keep going through the adversity. The thing is, in a way you need the hankies here much more that you need the laughter which is forced at times with the R-Rated Language.As long as you don't get caught with the phony Comedy Label, you might enjoy this one. Hawaii is looking good, which is the usual. The films does depict some twisting plot drama but Misses a few major twists towards the end that might have made it even more potent.",The Descendants
35,lasttimeisaw,The Descendants,8,24 January 2012,"After an unmerited winning an Oscar for supporting actor in SYRIANA (2005), George Clooney has been radiating his acting prowess since then alongside his director ambitions. After two nominated leading performances in MICHAEL CLAYTON (2007) and UP IN THE AIR (2009), I am ambivalent to judge if he is able to manage another stretch to bag another Oscar nomination seeing that he is not as multi-faceted as Jack Nicholson or DeNiro. THE DESCENDANTS is Alexander Payne's comeback work after the Oscar sweetheart SIDEWAYS (2004), a seven-year spell is rather too long for his ardent addicts (maybe partially is attributable to his ex-wife Sandra Oh), soothingly that the film has fetched all the accolades and been standing firmly under the spotlight as the frontrunner in the coming Oscar race (btw, the nomination is due in several hours, best wishes!). My opinion is that this film is excellent as though it fails to level with SIDEWAYS (a 9/10 for me), at any rate, it is Payne's another masterpiece which explores a viscerally connected rite-of-passage of a man and his family. An oddly dynamic tempo and a deeply affecting cinematography from Phedon Papamichael propels the film into a self-introspective journey both for the land baron Matt King and his viewers. George Clooney again locks up his prestigious celebrity identity and is vested a vast credibility to his character and showcases different layers of emotions, a surefire Oscar-worthy achievement. Two supporting ladies are striking too, Shailene Woodley and Judy Greer proffer their excellence and props both halves of the film respectively, Shailene possesses a drawing power of self-assurance as the defiant adolescent daughter, she is doomed to be a big name in Hollywood and an always snubbed Judy commits herself to her career-best within her paltry screen time. A doofus-looking Nick Krause and a chubbily cutesy Amara Miller almost of time are the comical toners and a mind-blowing comatose performance from Patricia Hastie also merits some tribute here. Otherwise the film's deficiency suffers a bit from its too deliberately concocted script and a far- fetched Hawaii magnitude (personally I cannot stand the periodic melodies in the film).",The Descendants
36,KineticSeoul,"It's alright, just not great coming of age film",6,17 August 2012,This is a calm and simple movie that doesn't try to be something more than what it is. George Clooney seems to do well with these types of role where his character has to deal with issues when it comes to people that surrounds him. And it doesn't have to be in a physical manner. What I liked about this movie is the execution of it all when it comes to Matt King(George Clooney) dealing with a wife that is in coma after cheating on him and his daughters. And lastly the family inheritance and what he is going to do with it and if money is everything in life. There isn't much character development but it does enough for the direction this film tries to go. I liked how some of the characters that starts off not likable become a bit likable or understandable as the movie progresses. It isn't done in a well developed fashion but it's good enough. This isn't a movie to watch with the family since most kids might get bored to tears and some teens might find this boring. Since it's contrived of mostly family issues without any action. It might not be one of the best simple movies I seen or one of the most memorable one but it's worth seeing at least once. Although I doubt I will be seeing it again.6/10,The Descendants
37,sddavis63,Potentially Both Heart-Wrenching And Heart-Warming But Its Focus Wasn't Always Clear,4,12 March 2013,"""The Descendants"" has a few things going for it, no doubt. First is the basic story. It's a heart-wrenching tragedy that the King family is going through. Mom Elizabeth has been involved in a boating accident, and now she's in a coma and on life support. She's not really expected to make it. Her husband Matt (George Clooney) is having to deal with her pending death and at the same time try to deal with his less than ideal relationship with his daughters Alex (Shailene Woodley) and Scottie (Amara Miller.) Matt's efforts to rebuild those relationships could also have made this potentially heart-warming and not just heart- wrenching. That in itself was a lot. It was emotional, and quite appropriately it had a few moments of humour that were necessary to lift the overall rather down mood. Clooney isn't my favourite actor. He was competent in this. I wouldn't go any farther than that. He just never seems to grab me with his performances. I was more impressed with Woddley to be honest. I thought she did a really good job as Alex, the older of the two sisters who's had a troubled relationship with both parents and who gets essentially forced back into the family's life after being away at boarding school as the tragedy unfolds. She was impressive. The movie also has Hawaii going for it. Is there a better place to set a movie? What I appreciated about this was that the movie didn't go overboard in its use of the setting, but scattered throughout were some very nice shots of the Hawaiian landscape. I have to say, though, that the scenery aside (and while I liked and was touched by the basic plot) the story as a whole really didn't grab me.Setting the pace of the movie aside (which I thought was rather slow) I thought that there was too much introduced. In addition to the drama around Elizabeth I really didn't need the subplot about the family's land, and whether or not it was going to be sold and to whom it was going to be sold. I mean, I understand the cultural context. I understand that land ownership and heritage protection is a huge issue in Hawaii. I just didn't think it added much to the movie. It seemed like something that was forced onto the story rather than something that fit well. There were also characters that I just didn't care for. To mention one: Alex's friend Sid (Nick Krause.) I'm sorry, but aside from a little bit of comic relief at his whole ""surfer dude"" (or was it ""pothead"") persona I didn't think he added much to the movie, and he wouldn't have been missed even a bit if his character hadn't been included.Generally speaking, I thought the movie had too much of a melodramatic feel to it. I'm not sure we need all the extraneous family tensions involved. The story of the dying wife and Matt's attempt to come to terms with both her condition and single parenthood would have been enough. Having so much added on seemed to make this lose its focus. Overall, this really didn't impress me all that much. (4/10)",The Descendants
38,Hellmant,To give Clooney best actor nomination status is a little absurd!,9,21 February 2012,"'THE DESCENDANTS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Alexander Payne (the man behind such critically acclaimed films as 'SIDEWAYS', 'ELECTION' and 'ABOUT SCHMIDT') co-wrote and directed this George Clooney starring comedy drama (which is yet another Oscar contender for best picture, as well as several others including nominations for Payne and Clooney). The film is about a lawyer who finds out his comatose wife was cheating on him. It's a pretty even mix of laughs and emotion, like all of Payne's films, and for the most part is a pretty effective and well done film. Clooney is decent in the lead role but far from Oscar worthy.Clooney plays Matt King, the sole trustee of a family land trust on the island of Kauai. His family, and he, have decided to sell the land for development due to the fact that they'll lose control of it in seven years because of the rule against perpetuities. Matt's wife Elizabeth (Patricia Hastie) recently suffered a boating accident that left her in a coma and will soon be cut off from life support due to her living will. Matt decides to spend some time with his two daughters (Shailene Woodley and Amara Miller), who he's spent little time with recently, as the three inform other family and friends of Patricia's passing. Matt is also hit with the news that Patricia cheated on him, by his eldest daughter, which throws his world into an even bigger whirlwind.The movie has enough big laughs to keep the film fast moving and entertaining and the drama is very poignant and touching at times. This is a film that definitely deserves the notice and recognition it's been receiving, all except for Clooney (in my opinion). He's definitely not a bad actor he's just not a very good actor either. He does almost always basically play himself and his range of emotions are very limited. Here his talents do fit the necessity of the role but to give him best actor nomination status for it is a little absurd.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEXQWgWt6cw",The Descendants
39,Buddy-51,A human drama that is both intimate and epic,9,4 May 2012,"In the tradition of ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" and ""Ordinary People,"" ""The Descendants"" is a high-toned social drama centered around the complex dynamics of familial relationships. Like those other films, it also won wide critical praise and a boatload of award nominations the year it was released.Matt King is a wealthy, workaholic businessman living in Hawaii with his wife and two daughters, the older of whom is a rebellious teen who's recently been shipped off to boarding school on another island. As the movie opens, we learn that Matt's world has begun to crash in on him big time as his wife lies in a coma brought on by a boating accident. Matt struggles not only with the guilt of having been an emotionally distant husband but with raising two precocious and challenging children, who are deep in the throes of typical growing pains and whom he barely seems to know at this point. He also has to deal with the complications of selling some of the valuable property he inherited from his wealthy ancestors to developers who may not be as attuned as he is to the natural beauty and ecological richness of the land.With a thoughtful and insightful screenplay by Nat Faxon, Jim Rash and director Alexander Payne, based on the novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings, the movie neatly sidesteps all the potential melodrama inherent in the material. The plot constantly wanders off onto interesting and unexpected bypaths, and characters who seem as if they could become easily pigeonholed refuse to do or say what we expect them to do or say. No one is a hero or a villain; they're all just ordinary folks trying to lead decent lives, though often falling far short of that mark, as we all do. Indeed, there is an air of verisimilitude to this film that is a rare commodity in modern commercial movie-making. At every moment, we feel as if are watching real people acting in real ways - just as if actual life were unfolding before us. In fact, there is not a single false moment to be found anywhere in the film.This is thanks, in no small measure, to George Clooney who has never given a truer or more deeply vulnerable performance than he does here, utilizing his innate good-guy persona to astonishing effect. Ditto for Shailene Woodley and Amara Miller who play his two daughters with unerring believability and conviction. Their interactions with one another are indeed a wonder to behold.With admirable restraint, director Alexander Payne is content to let the drama speak for itself. He has the decency to pull back and give the characters their space without feeling it necessary to push his points or exploit the audience's emotions. Yet, there is a lovely, hypnotic flow to the movie that draws us into both the tropical setting (how many movies set in Hawaii are about people who actually live there?) and the lives of these ordinary people who are suffering through an extraordinary - yet, at the same time, utterly universal - ordeal.A human drama that is as intimate as it is epic, ""The Descendants"" is one of the most profound and moving film-going experiences of recent years.",The Descendants
40,ElMaruecan82,"Circumstances can change you for the worst, tragedy for the best ...",9,15 March 2012,"Someone on IMDb used a curious word to describe ""The Descendants"", I was puzzled first but the more I thought of it, the more I realized how fitting it was: 'relaxing'. Indeed, for all the drama and all the emotionality the movie contained, it managed to find the perfect dosage with comedy, in order to keep our hearts hooked and our minds in harmony with the lead character, Matt King, played by George Clooney, in what will be his most memorable performance for ages. Maybe the Hawaiian setting played a significant part to that feeling, but apart from the escapist value of the film, It's not 'postcard' Hawaii that is featured here, skies are gray and there's no more bright sun there than sexy mermaids sunbathing on the beaches, but it's probably the portrayal which is the most faithful to reality.Matt King, along with countless cousins, a running-gag consist of starting their names with Cousin, is the descendant of one of the first land owner in Hawaii, he's a lawyer in Honolulu and he's officially the sole trustee of a family trust owning a part of unoccupied Paradise in an island named Kaua'i. Before the trust expire in seven years because of the rule against perpetuity, the Kings decided to sell it to a businessman named Holitzer, which would constitute a great opportunity for tourism and economical development. The Kings are Hawaiian by heart, their ancestor was a Hawaiian princess, and they believe in their attachment to their Island and its traditions. And this is one of the film's strengths, like Allen's ""Manhattan"" or Fellini's ""Roma"", the setting is not just original, it's part of the story as it's impossible to imagine it elsewhere. A few movies are so defined by their location, and feature characters so rooted in their traditions. And this is another strength of ""The Descendants"": the characters. The movie handles very archetypal situations, the theme of the father-too-busy to take care of his girls and having to endure their attitudes: Alex, the teenager with authority issues and Scottie, the child with destructive behavior, Sid the typical teenage boyfriend  the movie doesn't go without deja- vu situations. However, all the characters here are real, and no part of their insolence is to be taken for granted. Everybody has a past, something that conditioned a personality, and they're all connected to each other. The movie starts with the thrill-loving face of Elizabeth, the mother and the shot after, she's in a comatose state, we understand that she's victim of an accident and later, the doctor tells Matt that there's no hope for her, and they must let her die peacefully. Although she's virtually absent in the plot, the mother is the emotional core of the film as we learn more about her as the movie progresses, and her past indirectly reveals the past of the others and the roots of their behaviors. Through Elizabeth, we understand the reason of Alex's anger and what lead her family to become so dysfunctional. Matt is the living proof that a good man doesn't necessarily make a good parent, and he's held responsible for Elizabeth's state by his father-in-law, remarkably played by Robert Forster. Never would have Elizabeth been pushed to that situation, to that motorboat fatal accident, if Matt was less careless about his couple. The irony in Matt is that he's often blamed for what he didn't do instead of what he did, and although he's not without a responsibility, he's still the victim of circumstances. When he learned from Alex, that Elizabeth cheated on her, his grief turned into a ferocious anger rarely displayed in a film, and in a way, it helped to fill his time by trying to find the identity of his rival, if only for telling him that the woman he used to destroy a family –involuntarily, but the results are the same- is in the verge of death, and like all the other friends, he owed her a last visit. At least, she deserves that respect since the Family obviously doesn't. Matt's journey doesn't have a clear direction except to set all the parameters in order to let his wife die in peace, his interaction with his rival, shows how noble he's became in adversity, and interestingly, the trip is set in the very Island he must sell, which allows the daughters to see a part of themselves a last time before it's sold. We don't have time to question how the two plots will eventually connect, Alexander Payne has a way to play with his characters that lets you enjoy their evolution, their interaction and emotion without waiting for 'something to happen', like in ""About Schmidt"", each trip, each travel is an occasion for a human being to discover a way to become better, and the relaxing effect comes from the feeling that all these flawed and tormented characters we saw in the beginning, from Max to Scottie, from Alex to her friend Sid, would certainly come back as better people, and if not better, more in peace with themselves. The cathartic effect of ""The Descendants"" is a cinematic miracle. And the two stories finally converge in a stroke of genius, making Matt realize that nothing is hazardous or gratuitous in life, and each decision carries severe consequences, and maybe his wife's tragedy is a lesson for the future. Still, the film doesn't try to teach us something; it never addresses its audience with the patronizing tone. As I said, it finds the perfect tone between drama and comedy, enough to make us savor the ironies of life and how each inconvenience can contain a path to happiness and vice versa. George Clooney is the soul of this wonderful study on family and marital relationships, as man who realizes that if people can change to the worst by circumstances, a tragedy can change them for the best.",The Descendants
41,paul2001sw-1,Emotionally barren,5,25 November 2014,"Personally, I feel that the much acclaimed films of Alexander Payne are somewhat over-rated. 'Election' is funny but is also quite nasty, a sneer at those without money or special likability who nonetheless have the ambition to challenge the natural order; 'Sideways' seems to be loved by those who love its subject (namely wine), while 'About Schmidt' wins plaudits from fans of its star, Jack Nicholson. Payne's works have a certain quirkiness which arguably is simply the product of simplified characterisation, and in 'The Descendents', it's George Clooney's turn in the lead role, playing a man trying to come to terms with surprising discoveries about his comatose wife, and the fact that she is unlikely to recover. There could be an interesting story here, about a man who seems to have it all yet is forced to realise there is much that he has not understood, and will never understand. But emotions of just about every sort seem alien to Clooney's hyper-rational character: his own emotional blankness makes his incomprehension seem unsurprising and unmysterious to everyone but himself, and yet the point of the film seems rather different, painting its lead more as a put-upon hero than an emotional void. What really kills the film is its length: it's too emotionally dull to sustain itself, endless Hawaiian musical interludes notwithstanding. The movie even makes Hawaii itself seem dull, perpetually overcast and with cities comprising bland grids and skyscrapers. Perhaps that's meant to be part of the point; but the feeling of this movie was as ungraspable to me as the story within the film appears to be to its hero.",The Descendants
42,bowmanblue,Quite sweet really,7,11 March 2015,"George Clooney puts his heart on the line in this one, as a land baron who's forced to stop concentrating on his work when his wife suffers a critical accident, leaving her in a coma in the hospital. Therefore George must look after his two daughters, both who are going through various stages of adolescence.It's good to see someone normally as suave as Mr Clooney, looking pretty out of his depth with two young girls and he pulls it off well. Despite having plenty of adult themes running through it - death, adultery, family in-fighting - it's actually quite a nice film with a decent message about family values.It's not hilarious, but then it doesn't try to be. Just enjoy it for a gentle ride of good humour.",The Descendants
43,dromasca,a woman dies,6,7 June 2017,"The opening sequences of director Alexander Payne's The Descendants include a short (maybe less than one second) image of a powerful and beautiful woman surfing on the waves around Hawaii. For most of the rest of the film the woman will lie in a comma on a hospital bed and she will eventually die. What happens when a dear and close family member is suddenly taken by fate (a surfing accident in this case) from among us? How does the husband, how do the kids cope? Do we ever end discovering who the closer human being to us is? The answer this film gives is no, even after accident and death do us apart, we may not end discovering who we live or lived with.I am no big fan of this genre of movies. I can cope with death on screen in horror flicks, action movies or westerns because I know that they are fiction. It's more difficult to deal with such subjects in a realistic contemporary story, and none of the 'romantic' comedy or melodrama genres films succeed to my taste unless they are really very good. Actually one of Payne's previous films, the 2002 About Schmidt was one of these due to the extraordinary performances of Jack Nicholson and Kathy Bates. Here we have George Clooney in the role of the real-estate owner and super-busy professional whose wife accident brings back to the earthly dealings of coping with his two daughters - one just our of the teen years, the other just before her teen years - and a complicated property heritage selling in which family interests conflict with the keeping of the Hawaiian tradition and attachment to the land. Clooney is better in my view in emanating authority than emotions, his sense of humor helps him overcome the limitations of his acting skills, but in this film I had the feeling his playing on the emotional cords did not completely succeed.Yet, there are a few real good moments. I mentioned the opening scene which kind of opens the path to what follows. The performance of Amara Miller (as the younger daughter) when learning about her mother's fate is simply amazing. Shailene Woodley is also acting well as the elder daughter. Moments of real truth surge here and there, when some of the supporting actors (like Judy Greer) are left to express their emotions in the patterns dictated by the story. Hawaii gets its opportunity as the background of a real American story and I can just hope that more movie makers will come here for other reasons than filming beaches and waves. The good moments mix however with a too high dose of melodrama, expected turns of the story, sit-com like approach to dramatic situations. The Descendants promise much, deliver less, and its initial success seems to fade, like one of these beautiful color photos whose contrast fades in time blurring the persons and the landscape.",The Descendants
44,ThomasDrufke,One of Clooney's best,8,24 March 2014,"Impression- Being my first Alexander Payne movie that I have seen, I didn't dislike his style like a lot of people do. But there are a whole lot of people who adore how he directs, as of now I'm in that boat. This movie doesn't come off as depressing as some people may think, and its not a true comedy either. I thought it had the perfect tone for the type of story it was showing.Praise- Clooney gives one of his best performances as a drifting father who is just trying to reconnect with his not-so-perfect kids. This movie and Up In the Air proves Clooney still has it, and for me it erases that horrible Batman and Robin movie out of my mind when I think of Clooney. Shailene Woodley also showed her future Oscar talent in her troubled teen role. She is also one of the few actresses who don't have to wear any make up and still look incredible on screen. This movie was also well written, thanks to Payne, Jim Rash and Nat Faxon (The Way Way Back). Even the Sid character annoyed me at first, but he ended up with some great lines. Complaints - There were a few times when the family would just leave town for a few days to go take care of something, or for short business. To me, if a family member is on the brink of dying you don't leave town for anything. In fact, you make sure people come to see you, instead of the opposite. I understand its a movie, but they could have found another way of writing that. I also found there to be few too many coincidences in the plot, and I know Hawaii doesn't have the biggest population but the world just isn't that small.Final thoughts - Even with the plot being somewhat of a downer, this movie still sends you with a good feeling of the importance of family. Cap that off with great performances all around and you have an Oscar contender. I look forward to watching other Alexander Payne movies as well.8.0/10",The Descendants
45,MLDinTN,Clooney is boring,4,3 November 2012,"I'm only giving this movie a 4 because it takes place in Hawaii, and there is some pretty scenery to view. But that is all this movie has going for it. I don't get why Clooney was nominated for acting awards for this, it's not a great role. He plays Matt King, a native Hawaiian whose family owned lots of land and he and the relatives have sold it over the years to make millions. Matt saved a lot of his money and gets by on what he makes as a lawyer while other family members have wasted it. The family is about to sell their last parcel of land, but Matt has other worries, like the fact his wife was in a boating accident and is brain dead. He finds out she was having an affair from his daughter, Alex. His two kids, Alex and Scottie, are disrespectful and act like it's no big deal their mom is going to die.

We are meant to interpret the meanings of life and death and how one should deal with both. This is also quite a funny film, but there are some sad, dramatic moments too. I also find that some people may relate to this movie because the story seems like it could happen in real life.Alexander Payne's film is about a family whose mother is slowing dying after a terrible accident. The husband of the mother, Matt King is also in the midst of a business deal where he would sell off his family land. This film covers the outcomes of each event and also has themes of family and reconciliation.George Clooney is a wonderful actor and delivers another strong performance. However, the actress to look out for in the future is Shailene Woodley. In her first really big role, she shines as Matt King's daughter, Alexandra. She is believable in the role and she nicely compliments Clooney.Overall, this is a great film that will come off as dramatic, but is actually pretty funny.

49,secondtake,It feels good but really doesn't say or do anything terribly new or special,6,20 March 2012,"The Descendants (2011)Wow, lots of great sharp close-ups of George Clooney. And a wonderful place to set a movie, contemporary Hawaii, not just the surf and nature scene, but the reality, too, of family and people interacting casually.There's a forced plot here, a do good situation where some precious Hawaiian land is in danger of being developed, and you know almost from the first minute it's mentioned what the outcome will be. There's a second plot, too, which is more intense, having to do with an affair that gets uncovered and Clooney's sense of discovery and retribution for it.But what is supposed to be the main point of the movie, in terms of emotional intensity at least, is the trickiest and maybe the thinnest: Clooney's wife is in a coma and is set to have her life support unplugged and then shortly die. His two daughters are supposed to be mischief makers of the worst sort (unconvincingly) and the drama of the oncoming death and the affair discovered during the midst of it all makes the father and daughters reconsider each other.Sounds good but it only goes so far. Which is to say it's not a bad movie at all, just nothing that rises above. The one mention during, say, Academy Awards month was that Clooney's performance was standout. And it was, though not any more than other Clooney performances, restrained and consummately professional the same way Tom Hanks is. Which is often just a hair short of the breathtaking stuff others pull off at their best.The best part of the movie is probably just the relative accuracy of the local Hawaiian culture, relaxed and appreciative but also caught up in the usual material and family concerns of any other U.S. locale.",The Descendants

Shailene Woodley's surprisingly strong performance; 3. This film IS different.And it's that last point that I want to begin with. First of all, the setting. As I sat watching the film it occurred to me how few films are made in Hawaii. And it isn't just the lush setting that's attractive here. The setting was a key to the attitude of the characters in the film. Not to mention that a key facet of the plot is Hawaiian history. So, for numerous reasons, Hawaii was the perfect -- and different -- setting for this film. And the plot is ""different"", as well. Clooney is the somewhat absent husband whose wife is severely injured in a boating accident. Turns out she is dying, and he has to begin actively caring for his two daughters...not the most charming children on the planet...who nonetheless turn out to have some real character. But as he deals with his older daughter's drug and behavioral issues, he learns that his wife was having an affair. He and his daughter set out to confront the ""other man"", and what unfolds is a rather charming story, with enough humor not to make it maudlin, which it could have been.George Clooney is superb, and I say that as a moviegoer who didn't care for him in his television years, and have only sort of begrudgingly been won over in his Hollywood years. With this performance, for me, he has sealed the deal. I was somewhat reminded of the understated film performances of Spence Tracy.I had never heard of Shailene Woodley, but wow! What a wonderful young actress, especially since in the beginning of the film you are prepared not to like her character at all since she is a drug-troubled teen. But, with time, she transforms the character into a very interesting and strong-minded young lady. Other characters are well-played. I was disappointed in the role and performance of Beau Bridges...a long-time favorite of mine. Nothing special in his performance here.Excellent film, well-wroth going to the theater to see, and will end up on my DVD shelf!",The Descendants

I'm not going to say nothing new here, but it has amazing acting, great script (every conversation and interaction is done in such a way that you may not be able to predict what the character will do next), wonderful direction and beautiful soundtrack. And there is something extraordinary about the setting - it's like the character itself. The movie is funny, sad and absolutely entertaining. Two weeks after watching this film i still can't forget about it - it's just that good.

54,tabuno,Overly Ambitious,7,18 January 2019,"16 January 2012. It's understandable why this topically relevant movie that probes the emotional and mental difficulties of death and infidelity captures critical and popular acclaim. There are scenes and dialogue that appear to be difficult or emotional shockingly hard to bear and is bold enough to present American audiences with such harshness.Unfortunately, a closely, theatrical look at the movie reveals a number of weaknesses in its execution. There is a voice-over at the beginning which really seems to talk down to the audience, using narrative more appropriate for elementary school age children and which isn't used at the end of the movie which speaks for itself, unlike the narrative used in flashback form and at the end in Stand By Me (1986). The editing of the movie also seems to leave out important visual and acting behavioral scenes that would complete an vital emotional or intellectual point and thus the character development seems incomplete...the audience doesn't get an opportunity to develop sufficient rapport in the movie and the relatively quick set up seems to be fairly predictable and standard. The inclusion of so many archetype personalities, including a grandmother who has some mental issues, seems to be over-kill and in the end the inclusion of a boyfriend and even a younger sister/daugther seems to only dilute the film's ability to focus on the depth and qualitative full performances of George Clooney and his older daughter in the movie. Unlike the more raw and emotional riveting scenes and performance as found in Margot at the Wedding (2007), The Lovely Bones (2009), or The Ice Storm (1997) which would have possibly enwrapped the emotional intensity in a more powerful theatrical setting, Descendents instead attempts to provide a more polished and structured family drama as found other movies that are better scripted and stylized American Beauty (2000), The Pursuit of Happiness (2006), and Georgia Rule (2007). Descendents also spends an inordinate amount of screen time using a more immersive, photographic, or atmospheric design approach that also doesn't quite fit the narrative and subject matter as in this year's The Tree of Life (2011) or Lost in Translation (2003).Other family drama or relational dramas that had more emotional presence include Whale Rider (2002), Little Miss Sunshine (2006), even George Clooney's Up In The Air (2009), The Joy Luck Club (1993).",The Descendants

His wife Elizabeth is in a coma in the hospital following a boating accident. He struggles to deal with his daughters Scottie and Alexandra as, as he calls it, he is the ""back up parent"". Matt is also in control of a family trust. The trust owns a huge tract of land - aggressively sought by developers - the sale of which would be of great help financially to many of his broke cousins.George Clooney is superb, this is one of my favourite performances from him. I don't think anything will top my top 2 George Clooney performances ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" and ""O' Brother Where Art Tho"". I'm a fan of both his acting and directing. I even liked his Bruce Wayne. Not his Batman!! But his Bruce Wayne. Who better than charismatic gorgeous George Clooney to play a rich charismatic playboy?Whilst Clooney carries most if the movie on his shoulders, all of the cast do a fine job especially Beau Bridges, Robert Forster, Shailene Woodley (I what should be a breakout role) and Amara Miller is superb in her first role.One of my main problems with ""The Descendants"" (and this really is nit picking) is it exists in a world where George Clooney's wife would cheat on him with Shaggy from ""Scooby Do"". Alexander Payne (whose work I first noticed on ""Citizen Ruth) does a great job of directing his own script. Clooney deservedly won the Golden Globe for his performance here, and I believe he should have won the Oscar ahead of Jean Dujardin for ""The Artist"". Time will show the Academy got that one wrong.

56,tomgillespie2002,Fine comedy-drama about re-discovery,7,14 February 2012,"Hawaiian-based lawyer Matt King (George Clooney) is on the verge of brokering the sale of 25,000 acres of land which will make him and his extended family millionaires, when his wife is placed into a coma following a boating accident. Learning that she will never wake up, and that because of her will, the doctors will soon turn off the life support, Matt tries to re-connect with his two daughters, 17 year old Alexandra (Shailene Woodley) and 10 year old Scottie (Amara Miller). Scottie is in trouble at school for making inappropriate art and picking on fellow students, and Alexandra has problems with drinking. Matt also learns from Alexandra that his wife was having an affair with an estate agent named Brian Speer (Matthew Lillard), so they all travel to Kaua'i to confront him.Director Alexander Payne's previous films have all focused on deeply flawed yet entirely real human beings, and The Descendants is no exception. His 2004 masterpiece Sideways, one of the finest comedy- dramas of its decade, focused on a depressive, bitter writer and his adulterous friend on their stag holiday. These were quite despicable characters, yet thanks to a smart script, brilliant performances, and some genuine humanity, you became invested in them almost instantly. Clooney's Matt is hardly as unlikeable as that, but he is a man who has all but neglected his family for years, and one that holds the cards to a land sale that could see one of the state's most beautiful and natural location turned into a tourist hotspot.This is ultimately a story of re-discovery. Matt comes from a line of mixed white and Hawaiian descendants, and is constantly locked in a battle with himself over the sale of the land. He and his cousins plan to sell to a Hawaiian native, but the land is a vast area of beauty that he used to enjoy with his wife and children, and so by selling it, he will be ultimately selling himself out. Hawaii is key to the plot. Usually portrayed as a place of beauty and serenity, Payne breaks this trend in the first few scenes where he shows us the homeless shacked up on the beach, and the urban areas blowing with dirt and litter. It is also volcanic, and Payne shoots it with as many blues and greys as there are oranges and yellows. It is thought of as paradise, but as Matt tells us in the opening narration, ""paradise can go f**k itself.""Clooney gives possibly the best performance of his career here. He has no beard to alter his appearance like his Oscar-winning turn in Syriana (2005), here he is laid bare, and gives his most emotionally naked performance. He has truly come a long way since Batman & Robin (1997) almost single-handedly destroyed his career before it started, and I wouldn't be surprised if his name is called for Best Actor in the upcoming Academy Awards. Woodley is also impressive, quickly evolving from a generic bratty teenager into a mature confidant to her father.The Descendants has been advertised and portrayed as a comedy-drama, and although their is some fine comic moments in the film, usually stemming from Nick Krause's surfer-dude Sid's inappropriate comments, the film is ultimately an emotional drama. This led to frustrated shufflings in the cinema by people expecting either a generic rom-com or a full-blown comedy, and caused one very annoying fat idiot behind me repeatedly yawning. It is about 15 minutes too long, and lingers too much on the rather predictable and un-involving sub-plot about the land sale, but The Descendants is powerfully written and often very moving, and is a fine example of how Alexander Payne is the finest storyteller of real human beings working today.",The Descendants
57,Dr_Coulardeau,Our future is in our farewell to the dead,10,1 May 2012,"A strange film indeed echoing The Tree of Life. Has the West in its vast financial, debt and economic crisis become absolutely morbid when having to face the loss of its hegemony in the world? I believe so and there are two attitudes possible.Either you refuse it and you get angry and you start accusing everyone and the whole world of some kind of plot against you, like in Greece and you burn the central public library. That's the choice of the wife of the lover of the dying wife-mother-daughter-cousin-relative of the main male character marvellously rendered by Clooney.Or you start taming your anger and looking beyond this narrow-minded reaction and you try to come to terms with the situation, with death, with an affair, with so many things that should not prevent life from going on. Because life has to go on, even in Spain, Italy, Ireland, France and elsewhere in this Western world.And the choice is personal and has to be negotiated in the film by a middle-aged widowed husband and father; by a teenage daughter that had difficult relations with the mother; by a young daughter who is still a child and does not even know what death is; by the lover who loved or did not love but used the wife before her death and implanted in her some mirage; by the wife of that occasional and indelicate lover; by the members of the fund that is supposed to take care of a big chunk of one of the Hawaiian islands, a territory that is still virginal and is greedily desired by some real estate developer whose brother in law is the indelicate lover; by so many other people around that comatose woman who signed her will to be unplugged if she was to get into such a situation.Parting from the dying, nearly dead person is always difficult and Clooney and his fellow actors or family members play that drama, that painful trauma with the dignity and the restraint necessary to make it poignant without making it melodramatic. Just for that reason you should see that film and enjoy it. Take it as a good preparation for the traumas, personal, national or universal, that may happen tomorrow at sunrise, if not before.It is not the Tree of Life, but the Tree of Death that goes on growing beyond death because Death is Life and Life never stopped in front of Death.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",The Descendants
58,zkonedog,Never Gets Off The Ground,3,10 March 2017,"Some films have the intention of creating a lush, emotionally-moving story that works on a number of different levels, but end up failing due to a lack of overall execution. ""The Descendants"" is exactly that kind of movie.For a basic plot summary, ""The Descendants"" begins with Elizabeth King (Patricia Hastie) in a coma after a severe boating accident. When husband Matt (George Clooney) learns that she will not be waking up from her coma, he must take his two daughters Alex (Shailene Woodley) & Scottie (Amara Miller) on a trip to inform the relatives. Along the way, Matt discovers that Elizabeth was cheating on him, and alternatively confronts the man who she had the affair with.The biggest problem with this movie is that it utterly fails to tug at the emotions whatsoever. We are supposed to become deeply involved with the King family, but instead the character development just falls flat. It takes a great director to weave everything together, but in this case Alexander Payne just fails to get it done. All the elements are present...but it just doesn't jell together as it should.It is also strange that, despite the very Hawaiian soundtrack & locale, Hawaii doesn't add anything to this movie. If a movie is made that heavily features such a locale, it needs to be an integral part of the storyline. Instead, the Hawaiian flavor doesn't add a thing to this film...only muddying the waters further.Overall, ""The Descendants"" was a big letdown for me considering its Oscar buzz earlier in 2012. It is miles behind films like ""War House"", ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"", and ""The Help"". It doesn't even touch Clooney's earlier ""Up in the Air"" effort, which was one of the better films I saw that year. Unfortunately, this one just falls flat.",The Descendants

The performances are great and make the film worth watching, as George Clooney plays his character well. and Shailene Woodley does too as a relatively newcomer.

Payne does a great job by combining those two together. The characters are real and ordinary people, with their problems, passions, mistakes. They seem not to communicate, lost in their own believes. However the fatal accident will reunite them again, bring them closer, in order to understand each other better. On the other hand, the second theme is getting lost in the first one, mentioned only at the beginning and at the end. And even then, it is not expanded properly. Great performances from the actors, keep the audience interested till the end, which, in my opinion, was lucking of that volume that the rest of the film had.

61,howard.schumann,A film of spiritual awakening,9,26 November 2011,"Character growth seems like a lost art in many films these days but I'm happy to say that self-discovery plays a prominent role in The Descendants, Alexander Payne's first film since Sideways seven years ago. Based on the novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings, George Clooney is Matt King, a well-to-do real estate lawyer, who lives with his wife Elizabeth (Patricia Hastie) and two daughters, Scottie (Amara Miller) and Alexandra (Shailene Woodley) in Hawaii. At the outset, Matt's voice-over tells us not to expect Hawaii to be a paradise, that while it has beautiful scenery, it's not a paradise to those whose life is a daily grind and where family problems are as troublesome as anywhere else. Matt, whose family has deep roots in Hawaii, is the executor of a trust that holds 25,000 acres of beachside property, land that has been in the family for 150 years. He and his cousin Hugh (Beau Bridges) are in the process of collecting bids from big developers who want to turn it into resort property but Matt has the final say. While the negotiations are taking place, tragedy strikes. Matt's wife Elizabeth is in the hospital, seriously injured and in a coma from a boating accident. As a result, Matt has to assume the obligation of being both father and mother to his young daughters, especially being caring and present to their needs, attributes that seem to have been missing in his relationship with his family. It is quite obvious from the rebellious behavior of his daughters that they feel emotionally isolated and unloved. Seventeen-year-old Alex has been sent to a boarding school on another island for drug problems while ten-year-old Scottie has been sending threatening text messages to a girl in her class and is forced to apologize in person at her friend's home. After Alex comes home, Matt's world receives another jolt when, during a confrontation, she confesses to him that she knows her mom had been cheating on him for some time. Matt seems passive and uncertain as to how to deal with a difficult situation and appears to be more upset about the adultery than anything else. Though only a few days ago, Matt fantasized about how things would be different when she wakes up, he now learns that Elizabeth most likely will not recover from her injuries and searches for the best way to tell his family and friends. He asks Alex and Scottie to go with him to Elizabeth's parents to tell them first that she will not recover. Things become emotionally inflamed when Alex brings her boyfriend Sid (Nick Krause), a teenage stoner stereotype. When Sid makes dumb and inappropriate remarks, her grandfather Scott (Robert Forster) reacts in a childish way by throwing a punch at him, then they all have to listen to him berate Matt for not meeting his daughter's needs. Sid is in the film presumably for comic effect, but his effect is more offensive than comic. Implausibly, Matt goes to Sid late one night to ask for his advice on how to deal with his daughters, a ludicrous venture, but, in the process, discovers that beneath his irritating front, Sid is also going through his own grieving process. After some investigating, Matt discovers that the man Elizabeth had been seeing and was apparently in love with is Brian Speer (Matthew Lillard), also in real estate and who stands to profit from the sale of Matt's land. He decides to find Brian, not only to see what he is like but to invite him to visit Elizabeth at the hospital. The girls go with him to Kauai where Speer is on business and discovers that he is staying in a house directly opposite the beach they are visiting. Matthew's encounter with Speer and his wife (Judy Greer) enables him to communicate his pain and let go of some of his anger. But the process of letting go is not complete until he ""talks"" to his wife at the hospital, and begins to connect with his daughters in a way that was not possible only a short time ago. This connection also plays a role in how the real estate sale is handled. The Descendants is both funny and touching and the performance of George Clooney is one of his best, but it is not a perfect film. As in other recent works with a theme of forgiveness, important teachable moments, especially at the hospital, are overlooked. Also getting in the way is the materialist philosophy espoused my Matt that ""everything just happens,"" not aware perhaps that, in fact, everything does happen for a reason. These considerations notwithstanding, The Descendants is a strong film, marked by superb performances, especially by Clooney, Woodley, and Greer, outstanding cinematography by Phedon Papamichael, and a feeling of authenticity. On the surface, it is about the grieving process, but, underneath, it is about connection and responsibility to the planet we inhabit and to those who are on this journey with us. As author John Major Jenkins said, ""Let's remember that emergence is attended by a sense of emergency, and this is a hallmark of spiritual awakening. We may even call it a crisis, a crossroads. A collective crucifixion as we ride the wave of earth's apotheosis, awakening to the sacredness of the living sanctuary that our ancestors simply called ""home.""",The Descendants
62,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Emotionally challenging yet revelatory film everyone can connect with,10,28 November 2011,"Often times a change of scenery can make a big difference. Independent filmmaking has become as inextricably tied to relationship and family drama over the years as it has to New York City, Los Angeles and generic Suburbia. So taking place in Hawaii gives ""The Descendants a unique presence, not that Alexander Payne's outstanding film requires a tactical advantage. The venerated filmmaker simply understands how this setting, in all its tropical beauty and paradisiacal allure, has something important to say about this story of life's many blemishes.Matt King (George Clooney) is a lawyer and a descendant of Hawaiian royalty, as are his many cousins. A huge portion of land in Kauai has been passed down to all of them, land they ultimately must sell or give back to the state. They plan to take full advantage of their birthright and Matt is the trustee who must ultimately sign off on the sale. But Matt has been having a rough go of it lately: his wife, Elizabeth, has been in a coma for several weeks as a result of a boating accident and her prognosis grows grim. As such, he has become the primary caretaker of his 10-year-old daughter Scottie (Amara Miller). He also has a 17-year- old daughter named Alexandra (Shailene Woodley) at a rehabilitative boarding school on ""the Big Island.""Matt hopes he can weather the storm. He harbors some resentment with regards to being a ""back-up parent"" thrust into the starting lineup, but realizes his marriage had been growing cold and distant; he's gotten his wake-up call and he's ready to make things right. But when bad news from the doctor forces him to fetch Alexandra home from school, she reveals that the big fight she had with her mother before the accident was because she'd caught her having an affair.At first, Payne and Clooney paint Matt as a father with good intentions but really poor tact, but this news transforms him from a bit of a scrooge to a more pathetic individual, albeit one you have to feel a bit sorry for, especially given how his daughters, other relatives, and Alexandra's beach bum pal Sid (Nick Krause) behave around him. Although its not clear for a while whether Matt simply wants to stalk his wife's lover, confront him, get revenge or just find peace of mind, it's an undertaking you sympathize with given the waves of emotion experienced by the character.Clooney, in by far one of his very best performances if for nothing but the fact that he cannot lean on his charms, expertly embodies Matt's whirlwind. His portrayal fully demonstrates Matt as smart and rational yet emotionally feeble and sometimes volatile. As he throws on his boat shoes to run down the street and get answers from his wife's best friend and closest confidant, the awkwardness of it all comes out (most obviously in his bizarre gait). Even in life's toughest and craziest moments there's a darkly comic edge, and ""The Descendants"" hits on that in addition to the full range of other emotions. No doubt Payne's co-adaptors of Kaui Hart Hemmings' novel, little-known but highly recognizable character actors Nat Paxon (""Beerfest"") and Jim Rash (""Community""), had a hand in the sharp wit.But the real brilliance of the writing shows in the characters. Almost every one gives us cause for dislike or even hatred at some point, but each of those characters goes through a redemptive process and surprises us. Whether it's the daughters being obnoxious, Sid not knowing his place or even Matt's father-in-law laying thick blame on Matt, somehow they all find their way into our good graces by the end, which isn't an easy feat to pull off. That's testament to how much sincerity and humanity Payne brings to the film.""The Descendants"" will hit close to home for many and everyone will connect somehow whether with a character or empathy for the conflict. The very nature of Elizabeth, a woman unfaithful to her husband yet in a coma and on the verge of death, challenges everything we know about right and wrong, good parenting and bad parenting — it will awaken a change in perspective and what matters most in every person who sees it. The rest of the film and its many subplots just magnifies this, to the point that when Matt finally comes face to face with his wife's inamorato, you might be surprised at how you want it all to go down.Seeping in the cracks throughout is the Hawaiian setting. There's something about the tropical backdrop that elicits different emotions, that helps keep things in perspective when the drama ratchets up several more notches. Even something as simple as every male in the film over 20 wearing Tommy Bahama and khaki shorts enhances the story and the film's message. The beautiful Polynesian acoustic soundtrack can also not be understated in bolstering this effect.Great films reveal to us truths we've always known — whether in our minds or deep in our hearts — in a way that makes us feel as if we're realizing them again for the first time. ""The Descendants"" provides that unique light, in this case with some beaches and a few leis. Payne might have taken a long time off after ""Sideways,"" but he came back with something more palpable, universal and undeniably great.~Steven CVisit my site! http://moviemusereviews.com",The Descendants

64,Turfseer,"Light weight, Payne quirky dramedy, has its up and downs",6,29 January 2012,"'The Descendants' was directed by Alexander Payne, who also was a co-producer on the recently released 'Cedar Rapids'. Both films fall under the rubric of 'quirky indie dramedy' and director Payne seems to be drawn to this sort of quirky subject matter. While the 'quirkiness' and the 'comedy' are present in 'The Descendants', it's more muted than some of the other films Payne has been involved in.'The Descendants' involves how a family copes after the mother winds up comatose, following a near fatal head injury while water skiing, off the coast of Wakikiki in Hawaii. The husband, Matt King, somewhat mechanically played by George Clooney, is a Honolulu-based attorney who refers to himself as the 'back-up' parent. The first part of 'The Descendants' involves some rather ordinary scenes of Matt attempting to reign in his rebellious daughters (10 year old Scottie bullies a classmate and 17 year old Alex is found drinking when Matt goes to fetch her at the exclusive boarding school she's been staying at).Matt begins his journey of self-discovery when he's forced to make a decision as the head of a large family that owns a large parcel of land on the Hawaiian island of Kuau'i. The family has seven years to dispose of 25,000 acres before the family trust expires. Matt has openly backed the family majority's decision to sell the land to a wealthy developer, over the objections of many of the locals who fear that the pristine land will be spoiled by over development.I'll repeat here my definition of the quirky indie dramedy—it's a film that features a ""quirky protagonist, who must go on a journey of self-discovery, shedding a repressed upbringing with the aid of quirky allies, while thwarting the goals of a reactionary group that wishes to maintain the status quo."" The reactionary group here is the developer and the family members who conspire to sell off their land, to the detriment of the community at large. The quirky protagonist is Matt, who generally resorts to inoffensive, quirky machinations, to achieve his goals. The only real negative note that casts Matt (as well as daughter Alex) in a bad light, is when they refuse to accept the apology of Troy, who was driving the boat, when the mother had her accident. Otherwise, he can be found engaging in such quirky and harmless stratagems, such as mouthing off to his comatose wife in the hospital room or giving a passionate kiss, instead of a peck on the cheek ,to the wife of a man who had an affair with his wife, prior to her devastating injury.When Alex reveals that her mother had an affair with a man, Matt is determined to seek him out. This constitutes the 'second act' of the film and we're curious to see what Matt decides to do. Along the way, Matt gains an unusual quirky ally in the form of Alex's tactless teenage friend, Sid, who ends up being punched in the eye by the comatose woman's father, who holds Matt responsible for his daughter's injury.Through perseverance and outright luck, Matt finally tracks down the man his wife had the affair with; he's Brian Speer, a real estate developer, who Matt finds on Kuau'i, vacationing with his wife and kids. Fortunately there are no violent recriminations as Matt merely gives Brian a tongue lashing and promises to keep the affair secret from his wife (kudos to the screenwriters for keeping things low key and light weight!).Things get wrapped up in 'The Descendants' also on a low key note. Matt simply changes his mind and decides not to sign off on having the family sell the land to the developer. There may have been a taste of revenge on Matt's part, since Brian was set to receive some hefty real estate commissions, had the land been sold to the developer. But Matt makes it clear that it's his love of the land that compels him to go against the majority of the family's wishes.'The Descendants' is very light weight but has its heart in the right place. Not only does Matt get in touch with his altruistic side by keeping the land but also learns to become a better father. The family also is able to 'move on' after the mother is taken off life support. Only the quirky comedy (that's not very funny) gets in the way, epitomized by Julie Speer's rant, at film's end, when she 'loses it', revealing that she's figured it out that husband Brian indeed had been having an affair all along, with Matt's wife.I'm not sure if 'The Descendants' deserves all the awards it's been nominated for, since a main part of the story, Matt's decision to seek out his wife's lover, turns out to be markedly inconsequential. Nonetheless, the film is mildly interesting, especially in light of the protagonist's self-discovery, where the community benefits and a family is made whole.",The Descendants

And professionally high-level he undoubtedly is. I have always admired his ability to perform naturally and critically even in non-A category movies. But as for The Descendants, the latter is not the case: its director Alexander Paine deserved his Academy Award (although for the script and shared), but Paine has always been a sign of quality.The background is sad and tragic, and although all events are related to or originating from this woman in coma, the scenes are vivid and logical, all characters are contextual (and children use strong language as they often do in real life), and the only cliché for me was the main character's (Matt King) decision concerning the big sales.

To say the least, this movie is not one of Clooney's best and often we ask why the star ever accepted this role. Were it not for the rest of the cast members which include Nick Krause as Sid, Beau Bridges as Cousin Hugh and Robert Forester, the film would have failed from its true purpose. As is stands, this film is far from recommended. **",The Descendants
67,dfranzen70,One of 2011's best,9,11 November 2011,"The Descendants is not a movie that's easily defined. In the macro view, it's about a man grieving for his wife, who lies in a coma from which she may never emerge, while simultaneously attempting to care for his two rambunctious daughters, each of whom is nearly alien to the workaholic man. But don't hastily dismiss this as a tearjerker about some guy coming to grips with mortality and/or learning a little something about himself along the way. This is a movie that runs the gamut of emotions, with pristine sincerity, grace, dignity, and rich realism.Matt King (George Clooney) is the workaholic, a lawyer who lives in Hawaii. He has a good life - at least until his thrill-seeking wife suffers a serious head injury during a powerboat race, placing her in a deep coma. Matt's orderly life is no more. He must not only deal with the fact that he may never speak with his wife again, he must also learn an entirely new way of life - one with a domestic tinge. As wife Elizabeth's condition deteriorates, Matt must also deal with family and friends and open doors he never knew existed. All right, that's sort of cryptic, so let me give you this tidbit that is in no way a secret in the plot - Elizabeth, Matt shortly discovers, was having an affair at the time of her accident. On top of all of that stress and drama, Matt is the sole trustee of a huge plot of land that has been a part of his family for a very, very long time. He and his cousins have decided to field offers for the land, because the trust becomes dissolved in seven short years. Should they sell to the highest bidder or to a local businessman? Either outcome would leave all of them very rich indeed. The sale of the land will make a huge impact on the island, as it could transform what many see as a beautiful, nearly untouched mark of beauty into a symbol of avarice and decadence.The core of the entire story is Clooney's unbelievably terrific performance; he is vulnerable, strong, confused, decisive, anguished, angry. It's not every actor who can pull off such a wide range of expression, and Clooney is so effective in this movie that you sincerely feel as if you are standing directly in his shoes, seeing all from his perspective rather than just through his eyes. To say that Clooney's Matt is troubled is an understatement, but what makes this performance so remarkable to me is that at no time does he have all of the answers, and at no time does he have no answers at all. He is, to put it another way, us. The tremendous amount of pressure under which Matt finds himself is exacerbated by his daughters' behavior; partly their reaction to their mother's plight but also because, well, they're precocious and self- absorbed, as most kids are when they're teens or preteens. Add in Matt's cluelessness about how to take care of girls; then you have a real recipe for a wacky sitcom, don't you? Only here it's as real as it gets. First there's 10 year old Scotti (newcomer Amara Miller), who acts out in class - including bringing in pictures of her comatose mother for show and tell. Scotti seems like a girl who just hasn't had enough of a male influence in her short life; you get the impression that Mom was the one who took care of the kids while Dad worked and worked. As a result, Scotti is combining typical rebellious behavior with confusion on how she should feel about her mother's being in a coma. Then there's Alexandra, currently away at boarding school; for her, you get the clear impression that she's a real problem child who's used to being shunted from school to school, like a queen of diamonds in a marked-up deck. She's away when the accident occurs; Matt retrieves her (discovering she's as wild as always) and necessarily leans on her to help him deal with his various problems.Rest assured, there are moments that will jerk tears from you. However, director Alexander Payne does an amazing job of keeping everything level. This isn't a four-hankie movie, because life isn't a four-hankie movie. Life has its terrible moments and its joyous ones, too, and this film emulates that layer of authenticity to really deliver an emotionally powerful, provocative, and endearing story. This isn't a movie you can just grab the kids and some popcorn and be lightly entertained, but it's also not a Think Hard movie. It's somewhere in the middle - again, much like life. Payne and cowriters Nat Faxon and Jim Rash allow us to become psychologically engaged with everything concerning Matt and his family. We're with him so much that when he makes a blunder, we think to ourselves that we'd probably make the same blunder. It's a pleasure to see a movie in which the protagonist clearly doesn't have all of the answers, even to the easy questions, but has some answers to the hard ones. And that's why this is a hard movie to pigeonhole, and it's also why it's such a beautiful, artful film.",The Descendants
68,PWNYCNY,"Too much George Clooney, not enough dramatic power.",7,2 December 2011,"Enough close ups of George Clooney! Half the movie involves close ups of George Clooney. George Clooney is pensive. George Clooney is annoyed. George Clooney is smiling. George Clooney is confused. George Clooney is angry. It is obvious from the opening of this movie - narrated by George Clooney - that this story will revolve around George Clooney. And what makes it worse, his character owns lots of land, and of course the question is, what's George Clooney going to do with the land. Now, there is good cinematography, but the movie lacks dramatic power, primarily because one of the protagonists is in a vegetative state, and this movie proves that it is hard to argue with a someone in a vegetative state. This movie contains some of the more annoying child actors. But no matter how annoying they act, they cannot upstage George Clooney. The director who directed Sideways scores a huge miss with this movie. Not that the movie is bad, it isn't, it's just that it tells a story ... and that's it. Everybody lives happily ever after. The movie deals with some serious themes - such as end of life issues, marital infidelity, familial discord, some ethical issues - but never quite delivers. George Clooney's character has every right to feel enraged but the best he can do is pout. Robert Forster was good. In fact, he should have played the George Clooney role. As for George Clooney, stop hogging the scenes and please ease up on all the close ups.",The Descendants
69,meeza,Another good Payne!,8,21 December 2011,"""The Dependents"" is the movie about a single man in his mid- 40's who is deep in trouble with the IRS so he hires an obese mother and two cranky teenagers to be his dependents so he can collect more cash from Uncle Sam. OK, this is totally erroneous and false. But it wouldn't be a bad idea? Or maybe it would be. I am here to really review a good idea on film called ""The Descendants"". Writer-Director Alexander Payne's latest cinematic offering is worth all the accolades it has been receiving, even though ""Election"" and ""Sideways"" continue to be my favorite two movies of Alexander the Great. ""The Descendants"" stars George Clooney as Matt King, a wealthy Hawaiian lawyer whose wife is in a coma from a boating accident. Due to that unforeseen circumstance, Matt now has to be the parental king of his two daughters, 17-year old feisty teen Alexandra and insubordinate 10-year old Scottie. Matt is also in the process of selling a gargantuan amount of Hawaiian land that was owned by his ancestors and has been handed down from generation to generation throughout the years; Matt is the main proprietor of the land even though his King cousin clan are also involved in the selling. If they sell the land, they would make so much dough that they definitely will be kings for more than just one day. But the real Matt volcano eruption of ""The Descendants"" is when Matt is made aware by Alexandra that his wife was having an affair with another man. Payne is infamous in featuring a conflicted middle-age male protagonist as the centerpiece of his film's narratives. And in ""The Descendants"", Matt King is exactly that. Payne directed the movie with an easygoing pace which was delightful to watch even though the film deals with such an emotional distressing situation. Payne co-scripted the film's screenplay with Nat Faxon, and it was a very engaging one I must say. But a great Payne screenplay is usually a sure thing. Clooney has never been better, there are dimensions to his acting that have never been witnessed before on screen; not even in his great performance in ""The Dumpster"". O wait, he never acted in that movie, that is actually based on his personal life. You don't believe me- google Sarah Larson, Elisabetta Canalis, Lisa Snowdon, etc. etc. etc. Sorry George! Please don't sue me, or else I am going to have to find me ""The Defendants"". Anyways, Clooney's king performance as King should garner him a well-deserved Best Actor Oscar nomination. Also great was Shailene Woodley as Alexandra; Woodley you know it, this newcomer might also get an Oscar nomination for her strong supportive work. There were also brilliant supporting performances from Robert Forster as Matt's stubborn father-in-law Scott Thorson, and from Beau Bridges as Matt's easygoing but financially-determined cousin Hugh. Matthew Lillard appears in only one scene but he made the most of his limited screen time as Brian Speer, the man who had been speering Matt's wife. Ouch! Judy Greer, who has been stereotyped by portraying a female protagonist's supportive friend throughout her career, showed that it is time to give Ms. Greer a staring role; she was stupendous as Speer's wife Julie. However, the scene-stealer of ""The Descendants"" was undoubtedly Nick Krause whose performance as Sid, the feeble-minded teen friend of Alexandra who comes along for the ride, was a sure delight to an otherwise melancholy film. But not even Krause or Clooney gave the best performance of ""The Descendants"". That distinction would go to the state of Hawaii, whose ambiance and aura played key factors in the film's success and juxtaposed its narrative progression. Not many feel the ""The Descendants"" will descend to being snubbed for Oscar nominations. I am also in that school of thought. I did not like it as much as other critics or pseudo-critics (which is what I really am, OK now I need to go for ""the depressants"") did, but it is still another Payne piece that is definitely worth the ride. Aloha! **** Good",The Descendants
70,st-shot,Too casual for its own good.,6,8 December 2011,"With it's laid back setting and attire ( ""everyone looks like a bum or stunt man"" narrates the protagonist) Alex Payne's The Descendants adopts a matching leisurely pace that two thirds of the way through will make you feel like your on a beach in Honolulu in the throes of slumber. Veering from sharply original to suds The Descendants meanders about under the tropical sky of Hawaii accompanied by wailing ukuleles long enough to move the viewer from sympathy to fatigue for most of the principals.Lawyer Matt King (George Clooney) is under a lot of pressure these days trying to finalize a land deal that will impact his whole family but an Hawaiann Island as well. When his wife has a jet ski accident that puts her in an irreversible coma he gathers the rest of his dysfunctional family two daughters he hardly knows. Much to the shock of clueless dad, the oldest reveals mom was having an affair with a real estate salesman. As mom circles the drain King takes the daughters on a vacay to confront, it turns out, the married with children seducer.Director Payne delivers the American scene as well as anyone in film today. His ability to approach the mundane and slightly tawdry and breath fresh air into it with subtlety and originality has produced a quartet ( Citizen Ruth, Election, Sideways, About Schmidt) of sharp minimalist satires. In The Descendants there are more than a few gems both comic and tragic that display Payne's outstanding ability to keep the audience off balance. The film begins to wander midway however with repetitive family quarrels and excessive exposition. Unlike his other brisk offerings on the morose underpinnings of the American Dream he wallows in it here without benefit of timely injections of his sharp edged satirical bent.Like all Payne heroes King is a mass of contradiction and hypocrisy both noble and petty. Clooney forced to rely more on facial expressions and displaying a lot more incertitude without his usual devices (gun, love interest, dark villains and situations) does a fine job of stretching his thespian talent in another direction sustaining the storyline with deceptive ambiguity. Robert Foster is brusquely poignant as a father facing the loss of his daughter while Judy Greer as a wronged woman almost steals the film in a hospital visit scene that is classic Payne. It's a shame the rest of the film wasn't as healthy.",The Descendants
71,estebangonzalez10,"Not Payne's best work, but entertaining nonetheless",7,6 February 2012,"¨Goodbye, Elizabeth. Goodbye, my love, my friend, my pain, my joy. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye.¨The Descendants is a good film, but I was expecting much more from this dramedy written and directed by Alexander Payne, the man who brought us About Schmidt and Sideways. I was a huge fan of Sideways, and it had been over seven years since Payne directed another movie so I was highly anticipating this one staring George Clooney. Clooney is a great actor and this role seemed perfect for him. After hearing so much buzz from critics and the Academy about this picture, director, and performance from Clooney, my expectations grew even higher. Perhaps it was this over hype that left me a sensation of incompleteness after finishing watching The Descendants. The story was funny, but the characters weren't as interesting as most of Payne's characters were in other movies, and Clooney was great in the lead role, but far from being Oscar worthy in my opinion since I've seen far more better performances from other actors this year. Clooney is a natural and he made his performance actually seem real natural, but I thought relatively unknown Shailene Woodley stole several scenes from him. It's hard not to like someone like Clooney with his charm and charisma, but I don't think that's enough to honor him with another Oscar. He did have one strong scene when he was giving his final farewell speech to his dying wife so don't get me wrong, I did like his performance, I just expected so much more and perhaps those expectations affected my overall perception of the movie. I guess The Descendants actually had me at Payne, Clooney, and Hawaii. It was not as good as I expected, but it was still a lot of fun.George Clooney plays a wealthy land owner from Hawaii named Matt King. His descendants used to be sort of rulers of a big island in Hawaii and therefore he and his family owned most of the land. They are receiving millionairy offers from several businessmen who want to buy the land and build beautiful resorts or shopping malls. Matt however has decided to make a living as a lawyer and spends most of his time in his office. Clooney tells us all this in voice over as he narrates how his wife had a boating accident and has been lying in a coma for the past three weeks. Meanwhile, he has no idea how to raise his nine year old daughter, Scottie (Amara Miller), who has been causing all sorts of trouble in school and at home. Matt decides it's time to go bring his seventeen year old daughter, Alexandra (Shailene Woodley), back from boarding school to help him out with Scottie. Alexandra had a big fight with her mother before the boating accident and is kind of in a rebellious stage, but decides to help out her father after realizing that her mom is not going to get better. Alexandra reveals to Matt that the reason she was fighting with her mom was because she was having an affair with another man, who they later find out to be a real estate businessman named Brian (Matthew Lillard). Alexandra and Matt decide they should find a way to confront him and so they travel to another Hawaiian island where Brian is located. Alexandra brings along one of her friends named Sid (Nick Krause) who practically follows them around everywhere not helping out much, although Matt does seek for their advice most of the time. Payne's film does work solidly as a decent drama with sufficient comedy to lighten up the dark subject matter of the movie. The characters are interesting, although some of the secondary characters are pretty much one dimensional. It's still interesting to see how Clooney's character really doesn't know what he's doing most of the time. He is lost, and looks for his daughter's advice quite often. Most of the comedy comes from Payne's script which is funny as usual, although the cast also help out a lot. I guess since I'm from South America I'm used to seeing a lot of films dealing with society and family dramas since pretty much every Latin film deals with these subject matters, so it wasn't something new for me. Hollywood on the other hand isn't really known for creating these quality dramas so I can see how some of the critics were blown away by this film. But if you consider other foreign films, like this year's Iranian drama A Separation, then you will notice the difference. What Payne does best however is add some comedy into the mix and it always works well for him, although this time I thought it wasn't up to par with his previous film Sideways. The Descendants is a good movie, with some strong performances, but I'd rather watch his previous films before watching this again. The one good thing going for this movie is the beautiful scenery set in Hawaii. I recommend this film, but just don't go into it as hyped as I was because you could be disappointed.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",The Descendants
72,mattkratz,:-),9,23 October 2016,"George Clooney's opening monologue should tell you everything-he may be living in Hawaii, but his life is no paradise.

73,barnabyrudge,"Languid exploration of love, loss and infidelity in paradise.",8,5 February 2012,"Director Alexander Payne has been quiet for several years, his last film being Sideways in 2004. Is he subscribing to the Stanley Kubrick and Terrence Malick philosophy of film-making, which basically states that you do absolutely nothing for years, then return with a masterpiece so that anyone who might forget is soon reminded how good you are? Payne certainly has some way to go before he can be mentioned in the same breath as those two greats. However, he is building an impressive body of work – Sideways we've mentioned already, but there's also About Schmidt, Election, Citizen Ruth. and now The Descendants. A striking filmography by anyone's standards.A middle-aged woman skims across the sea in a motor boat, hair billowing behind her, laughing joyously. The very next scene finds the same woman comatose on a hospital bed, face bruised and swollen, tubes protruding from all over her body. Her husband Matt King (George Clooney) stands over her, grimly contemplating his lot in life. ""Paradise?"" he grunts bitterly. ""Paradise can go f@ck itself!"" Gradually, we learn that Matt is a wealthy lawyer who, due to a quirk of history, is the sole trustee of a sizable stretch of virgin Hawaiian coast. Despite his wealth, his relationship with his wife and kids has grown increasingly remote. Now, her coma forces Matt to confront issues he has been hiding from for years. He suddenly finds himself responsible for ten year-old daughter Scottie (Amara Miller) and 17 year-old tearaway Alex (Shailene Woodley). On top of that is the fact that the whole family are due to meet imminently to discuss what to do with their piece of paradise. And as if that isn't enough, Matt finds himself on the receiving end of the ultimate bombshell - when Alex tells him she recently caught mom having an affair.The entire film is about Matt's long journey to resolution – how he resolves his wife's infidelity, his craving to re-connect with his kids, the fate of the land bequeathed to his family, the impending death of his wife, etc. In typical Payne fashion, the story never follows the expected course. It weaves quite wonderfully in various directions, never playing to convention yet never losing sight of the human drama at its core. Clooney demonstrates a surprising emotional range - quietly furious one moment, comically absurd the next – while Woodley as the eldest daughter is simply outstanding. The quality of the other acting is exceptional too whatever else you think of The Descendants, it is certainly an immaculately acted film. Also admirable is the way the script manages to make Hawaii itself an integral ""character"" in the unfolding drama. It's been a long time since a story and a setting have complemented each other so consummately. The second half of the film - in which Matt tries to track down the realtor with whom his wife had her illicit affair - is slightly less compelling than the first. The story begins to sag in places, but at least Payne's off-kilter handling keeps things eminently watchable through these moments. Some viewers may be put off by the film's intentionally slow place, but in reality it is not so much a slow movie as a languid one, where events and characters are carefully developed in a way which feels convincing and honest. One has to be prepared to adjust to the pace, but once the film sinks its hook into you it keeps you absorbed all the way to its bittersweet final shot.",The Descendants
74,juneebuggy,"""My friends on the mainland think just because I live in Hawaii, I live in paradise. Are they insane?""",9,7 May 2015,"Well this was super good. Funny, heartbreaking and beautifully acted. I also enjoyed the Hawaiian location which is such a big part of this movie. George Clooney is exceptional, conveying a range of subtle emotions. His character really made me laugh but broke my heart as well. Initially he does a voice-over which sets the tone and explains his mindset well; angry, frustrated and broken.Hard to find any flaws here, a beautiful, unique story, filled with great scenery, moving performances and quite a few laughs. The story's been based on a debut novel which follows Matt King, a middle aged man who, while in the middle of a (family) land deal discovers that his comatose wife was having an affair and sets off with his 2 daughters to confront her lover before she dies.Shailene Woodley plays his oldest daughter and is an absolute scene stealer, acting older than her years as she becomes 'Matt's' partner in finding and confronting Brian. I also enjoyed the boy that played her friend, hilarious and then surprising the audience with his own tragic tale. Loved the closing scene in front of the TV with moms blanket, ice-cream and 'March Of The Penguins'.The mom actually looked like a coma patient here too, all bruised, twisted up and ugly, not the soap opera version that we usually get.

75,3xHCCH,Too Much Awards Hype May Make You Expect Too Much,7,23 January 2012,"""The Descendants"" is the latest film of Alexander Payne, who directed that excellent ""dram-edy"" called ""Sideways"" a few years back. It has won a lot of accolades in this year's awards season, biggest of which was the Best Picture Drama from the Golden Globes. Its star George Clooney is practically already a lock for Best Actor at the Oscars. All of this awards hype make you expect an exceptional film experience.If you know ""Sideways"", then you should not expect ""The Descendants"" to be far off in terms of story telling and treatment. The story is about Matt King (Clooney), a busy real-estate lawyer, who tries to reach out and rebuild his family when his wife gets comatose because of a boating accident. His daughters Alexandra (Shailene Woodley) and Scottie (Amara Miller) have both become distant and disrespectful. A big secret of his wife gets revealed in the meantime that throws Matt's world into a bigger turmoil. This is a simple family drama Payne-style, not really ""Oscar"" material for a lot of people. Do not expect too much, or it may disappoint you.As for George Clooney, he is de-glamorized here as this harassed father with sassy daughters. Here, Clooney's Matt King was a desperate and weak character, but ultimately comes into his own as the story comes along, and we bear witness to his character's growth. He will definitely be a contender for Best Actor, even simply for playing against his usual slick, well-dressed, Danny Ocean-type characters. Clooney is quiet and subtle, much like his turn in ""Up in the Air"", but this one has more substance for me.

None of the characters are what one would call ""extremist"", though they have extremist moments, as real people do.A few things are going on in this story. One is the drama involving the wife of the Clooney character on life support after an accident. It turns out she was also having an affair.There is also the business of the ""descendants"" handling a piece of land passed down to them in Hawaii. This could just as well be Indiana, Iowa, Idaho, Illinois, anywhere, but it happens to be Hawaii.The closeness of the family is at stake. That means both the immediate family of the Clooney character and the ""descendants"", who could drift apart if the land is sold.Usually, cousins are pretty close. Here, we have people going back a few more generations, and staying in a friendly family atmosphere. Meanwhile, the man's family, which is very normal actually, has a few tense moments. The oldest daughter's boyfriend is credibly annoying. The father finds the dork boyfriend annoying, and even hits him after the boyfriend does something horribly stupid out of ignorance, but then the father realizes that any young man that age who wasn't annoying would be unnaturally sick.

78,TdSmth5,This movie is a joke,3,25 February 2012,"The Descendants has one and a half stories. One that barely goes anywhere and half a story that goes nowhere. We are led to believe that the half a story is the significant one but there is no reason for that. I'll tell about this movie from the perspective of the actual story.Clooney plays King a rich lawyer who is descendant of a long line of Hawaiian landowners. All the lands are in a trust and he's in charge. The trust will dissolve in a couple of years so it's time to do something about it. Most of the relatives want to sell and there are two buyers. A local and an outsider. Most, including King, favor the local.But as the family meetings to decide all this approach, King's wife ends up in a coma from an accident on the water. Per her wishes, she is disconnected from life support. King now has to take care of his two daughters, a 10 year old and a troubled 17 year old.In one of the few meaningful lines in the movie we learn that the older daughter fought with her mother because the mother was cheating on King. That puts everything on the back-burner for King as he now wants to find out about the other guy. The older daughter helps him with that mission. It turns out, in one of those only-in-the-movie coincidences that the other guy is a real estate agent, cousin of the local prospective buyer of the King lands. He would end up making a ton of money if the family decides to sell to the local. That of course will influence King's decision process come time to meet with his cousins.Along for the ride is the older daughter's boyfriend/friend a dumb surfer dude, who just expresses his opinions without filter and that gets him in trouble.The filmmakers want to convince us that the comatose woman story is what matters here and there sure are endless shots of the dying woman's face for some reason. We meet her parents, the mom with Alzheimer's and the short-tempered dad who blames King for the accident. Since the woman is disconnected she dies eventually and the family ends up watching TV.It is remarkable and unfortunate that a lazy script like this got made into a movie. How many true scriptwriters are out there trying to sell great ideas. This script would have made a decent short film, perhaps. But most definitely not a 2 hour movie. It's a half baked movie all around. Directionless, dull, lame, and worst of all pointless. We don't learn anything about the hardships of life. King is clueless, so is everyone else, including and especially the filmmakers. He ends up resorting to the dopey boyfriend for advice. But King seems really like a stranger to his kids, he knows nothing about them. The supposedly troubled teen is pretty levelheaded once she is given a mission to assist in the search for the other guy.What makes the movie watchable is the cast for the most part. Clooney- cast against type- and Woodley try their best here but what do they have to work with- not a lot. Despite the serious issues, the tone of the movie is always off, giving it a silly lightness that is unsuited and ridiculous. It's impossible to recommend this movie, there is nothing here worthwhile- let alone award-winning.",The Descendants
79,EUyeshima,Family Angst and Mid-Life Crises in Paradise Anchored by Clooney's Sterling Work,8,11 December 2011,"There's a great line in this 2011 dramedy spoken in a voice-over by the protagonist: ""Give your children enough money to do something but not so much that they do nothing."" I'm not sure if that came from author Kaui Hart Hemmings' source novel or from director/co-screenwriter Alexander Payne's pen. Regardless, it's hard to believe Payne hasn't directed a full-length feature since the acclaimed ""Sideways"" in 2004, as this 2011 dramedy most definitely bears his signature approach in focusing on a core set of flawed characters with a deft seriocomic hand. Although the movie is not quite at the level of ""Sideways"" in shaggily mixing humor with pathos, it does boast a strong performance from George Clooney as Matt King, a wealthy O'ahu-based lawyer with Hawaiian blood, who finds himself in the enviable position of being the sole trustee of 25,000 acres of untouched land on Kaua'i. Dictated by state law, he is just about to get his extended family of cousins to reach consensus on selling the land to a native developer when tragedy strikes.Co-written by Payne, Nat Faxon and Jim Rash, the main narrative revolves around a boating accident that puts Matt's wife Elizabeth into a coma. This tragedy highlights the fact that King, a workaholic by nature, has distanced himself from his two daughters, ten-year-old Scottie and 17-year-old Alex. Suddenly, he discovers he needs to step forward and confront Scottie's bullying at school and Alex's rebellious hostility. When it becomes clear to him that Elizabeth will never recover, he tells Alex they need to visit family members to give them an opportunity to say goodbye. The strenuously resistant Alex surprises him by sharing that she caught her mother having an affair before the accident. This starts a family journey that gives way to revelations and confrontations which allow him to acknowledge his own failures and make peace with what the future will bring. On the surface, the story sounds like it will turn into a straight-ahead tearjerker, but thanks to Payne's discretion, the emotions the characters express and the situations they face are far more disheveled than that and consequently more compelling.It's not that Clooney does anything that takes him that far away from his usual screen persona here. Rather, he backseats his trademark coolness to convey a deeper level of vulnerability and confusion as a man unprepared for single parenthood. As Alex, Shailene Woodley gives a terrifically nuanced performance traversing easily between unbridled insolence and supportive nurturing. Amara Miller provides the right level of precocious honesty in her moments as Scottie. The rest of the cast makes less of an impression, for instance, Robert Forster as Matt's highly coiled father-in-law and Judy Greer as the unsuspecting wife of the realtor who had the affair with Elizabeth. The one fly in the ointment is Nick Krause, who appears to serve purely as a comic plot device as Alex's stoner-dude pal Sid. This character is the one major misstep in Payne's treatment. On the upside, cinematographer Phedon Papamichael captures the Hawaiian locations with greater variety than you would expect, and the soundtrack uses purely Hawaiian music to great effect. This is worthwhile viewing mostly for Clooney's work.",The Descendants
80,aharmas,Less is More,8,25 November 2011,"Alexander Payne has given us strong story telling before, going deep into the various shadings of human relationships. He reaches, explores, and delivers, usually with the help of very talented people (Giamatti, Witherspoon, Clooney). Here in ""The Immortals"" is the tale of a father and his family, trying to make peace with two major conflicts in his life; somehow he pulls everything together, but he discovers life will probably never be the same, as long as he accepts some deals along the way.Matt (Clooney) must make two important decisions soon: he has to see the extent of his wife's health decay, and he must act on some legalities involving some prime real estate property in Kauai. In his journey to the resolution of his problems, he must find a way to mend his relationship with is daughters. Here we run into a couple of bumpy stretches, as the younger actress overplays her role a bit and threatens to lessen the impact of the scenes. Clooney manages to save this section of the movie in spite of the way her daughter's role is portrayed. It is much more subtle in the book.Later on, it's not hard to be distracted by his older daughter's facial profile, which brings to mind Portman, an actress whose range is no match for the lovely Shallene Woodley. Portman manages to portray different types of upset with a look that resembles some type of physical discomfort. Woodley broadcasts an amazing range of emotions with a look. She doesn't resort to histrionics or overacting. There are some key scenes where her father meets the man who had apparently derailed his marriage, and she embodies complete charm with a dark twist as the must clear the way for his father's meeting with his dying wife's lover. She is also amazingly warm in her portrayal of the protective sister, a real demonstration of an older teen's age and frustration trying to love her younger sibling.Talking about great acting, the man of the hour is Clooney. His Matt is complex, vulnerable, strong, resilient, and on the brink of a breakdown, but his nature is also that of a survivor, and many will wonder whether his wife's past affairs affect his ultimate decision, or whether he is really looking at the future through his appreciation of history and ecology. Whatever the choice is, one can't help appreciate the work of the supporting cast, with Bridges showing the cold heart of the greedy investor and Robert Foster, as his father-in-law giving us the perspective of the grieving family. Still, everything revolves around Clooney's hurt and his affecting performance. He bares the character's soul, looking at us through an understanding of what love and pain can do to you in moments like these. He shows love, sorrow, hurt, jealousy, sadness, loss, and even happiness at various times. It's a winning performance.While watching the film, I couldn't help connecting it to other classics, such as the masterful ""Terms of Endearment"", another film whose impact was lessened by an interesting musical score. Here, there was potential for further damage with a very intrusive vocals by a Hawaiian performer. Where the acting is so powerful because of its restraint, the opposite happens, as we almost start sinking into travel mode, as we see repeated views of the lovely Hawaiian landscape. True, we need to weigh the impact of the surroundings in Matt's world and decision making moments, but the vocals are a bit too much, and they muddle the emotions, as we keep wondering when and where the luau and the fire dancers are.Other than that, less is more in Payne's direction and narrative. Simple moments in the hospital rooms are powerful stuff. Exchanges between father and daughter, father and father, man and romantic rival speak volumes, louder and better than any thematic music could do. One can only hope the DVD edition keeps it simple, remembering that less is sometimes way more than we can hope for.",The Descendants
81,valleyjohn,Great tranquil feel about it.,8,29 February 2012,"THE DESCENDANTS - 8 out of 10 I sometimes think that considering the obvious talent George Clooney has , he does not test himself enough with some of he roles he picks . He is certainly one of the most gifted and natural actors around and the ease in which he makes acting look is frightening . . Thankfully the role of Matt King in The Descendants is a much bigger test of his ability and it's no surprise that the Cloonmiester comes out of it with flying colours.Matt King is a father of two girls and a husband to a wife who is in a Coma after a boating accident. While she he is trying to be a father to his girls for the first time in his life , he finds out that his wife was up things he new nothing about.What i like about this film is it's slow pace . Despite the tragic circumstantial of what's on show , it has a lovely tranquil feel about it. It helps that it's set in Hawaii and that it has a fantastic soundtrack of Hawaiin music but it's also down to a great script.At times it has a Coen brothers feel about it . It may be because Clooney is in the lead or it may be that the humour is the same.The acting is great by all the cast and i especially like Nick Krause who played Sid. Although it'snot the best film I've seen recently it certainly deserves it's Oscar nominations.",The Descendants
82,Samiam3,"Competent all around, arguably a winning product for 2011",8,19 November 2011,"I hadn't seen so many elderly folks in a movie theatre, since I saw The King's Speech last year. I suppose there is a bit of irony in considering that a film called the Descendants has an audience of ancestors.The best thing about the movie however, is that I think it can be appreciated greatly by any adult age group, elder or not. There are laughs to be had and tears to be shed. The film centres around middle aged, Matt King; a Hawaiian land baron attempting to connect with his children with the knowledge that his comatose wife is at death's doorstep, and he knows that she had an affair before her accident. Meanwhile, he is under pressure from his network of cousins to sell his inherited land to the kind of real estate that wants to put up a seaside condo-mania. In essence, it's a recovery story. The formula is not entirely 'new' yet the somewhat paradoxical balance of refinement and dry humour are enough to elevate this to a very well rounded story. As far as drama comedies go, The Descendants is ideal.This may be George Clooney's best lead performance to date. I think it is the first role that doesn't require him to be slick or charismatic even for a moment. He is rather scruffy, but more importantly, he is human. Clooney brings range to the role, hitting all the right notes, funny and serious alike.I like the fact that even though we are on Hawaii (a photographer's paradise) the island doesn't look all that special. It's important that The islands look just as mundane to the audience as it would to the characters who inhabitant it. Most of the time it's cloudy, and low brow, except for the few moments where it is necessary to bring out the sunshine, as we stand on a cliffs edge with the King family overlooking dozens of acres of land which could very soon become merchandise.Another thing I like about the Descendents (which you don't see often) is an ending that is both happy and sad. Some say that great films are the ones that leave you wanting more. The Descendants did this to me, and it's probably the closest thing to a great film I've seen this year.",The Descendants
83,lastliberal-853-253708,"You give your children enough money to do something, but not enough to do nothing.",8,9 November 2013,"This is one of the most well-written stories I have seen.In addition, the acting was superb. George Clooney was magnificent, and Shailene Woodley, as his older daughter is definitely a rising star. The supporting players, however short their time on screen was, added an effective punch to the story.I really felt I was watching a documentary about a family dealing with multiple crises. Everything just seemed so real. It was funny, and sad, and you really felt for Clooney's character, having to deal with the death of his cheating wife and raising two daughters.I don't usually comment about editing, but it was so evident here. The film flowed smoothly, and there was never a wasted or dull moment.",The Descendants
84,davidmvining,"Good, but hampered by poor voiceover",7,21 November 2019,"This movie made me hate voice-overs.I'd never felt any real emotion to the technique. I remember Brian Cox's speech in Adaptation about how voice-over was lazy writing in film and scoffing at it a bit. Granted, I've always preferred the voice-over free version of Blade Runner, but the technique itself never really brought up any emotions.The first third of The Descendants is chock full of George Clooney's voice-over, and it's terrible. Awful. It takes interesting images we're seeing and strips them of their power by stating plainly what the point is. He lives in Hawaii and he needs to collect his oldest daughter from another island than on which he lives. The idea of his daughter living on a completely different island while also being estranged is a good image, but then Clooney's voice makes the exact point through dialogue. It robs the image of any power, and reminds me of the rare interview with Kubrick where he says that he doesn't want to try to explain the ending of 2001 because saying it undermines the movie itself.Anyway, that opening third set me against the movie, but it quickly turned itself around.The story of Clooney's journey at letting go of his wife in a permanent coma even after he finds out that she was cheating on him and was planning on leaving him. Yes, he grants, their marriage wasn't happy, but it grates on him to hear her father (a wonderful Robert Forster) calling her a good and faithful wife and that Clooney was a terrible husband.This journey is paired with Clooney's work to sell some ancestral land that his family must part with in seven years. The family that owns the trust that owns the land is taking bids on the land with the hope of turning it into a large profit for the family as soon as possible. So, he's juggling letting go of his wife and letting go of family property that they've owned since the 1860s.His solution for both issues is to, at the same time, let go and look forward to the future. He can't change the past, but he can try to improve the future. He can't change the fact that his wife and he had a bad marriage that led to infidelity, but he can grow closer with his two daughters. He can't change the fact that his family wants to sell the land, but he can try to still find a way to preserve it at the same time.If the first act of this movie weren't so clunky and obvious, I'd love this movie, but because of that first thirty minutes I think the film ends up being just good. Which is kind of sad, because I would have liked to love it.",The Descendants
85,jadepietro,It Takes A Family to Make A Village,9,23 November 2011,"This film is highly recommended.Set in modern day Hawaii, in a land lost between scenic palm trees and concrete squalor, Alexander Payne's The Descendants begins with the image of a healthy and happy wife and mother of two on a boating trip. This character rarely speaks or communicates in much of the film, but her role as family matriarch plays into the drama that will unfold. No, the main character of our tale happens to be her husband, Matt King, winningly played by George Clooney. Matt is not much of a husband, dad, or family man. He rarely is in touch with his estranged daughters. He is more devoted to his business ventures which afford him and his family all the wealth, fame, and social standings on the island. He and his family also own prime real estate on this section of paradise and are deciding on parceling out some of that land for tourist attractions, resorts, and condominiums. That is, before tragedy befalls them and their lives are thrown together once again.Clooney continues to ooze charm and bravado with his screen persona. The actor wisely downplays his handsome good looks to mask a frightened man-child suddenly faced with life's reality and responsibility. This is a finely honed portrayal that encapsulates a common man caught and unable to escape the dilemmas that now face him. Clooney's intrinsic acting reaches comic highs with his slow burns and dead-pan reactions one moment, only to become quite emotionally centered and heartfelt in his more dramatic scenes in the latter part of the film. This is one of his finest performances in a career of strong film roles.The supporting cast that surrounds Clooney is an accomplished lot. The daughters are played by newcomers Amara Miller as Scottie and Shailene Woodley as Alexandra who play off each other very well as real siblings would. Woodley, in particular, is a revelation, handling the comedic and dramatic sides of this troubled teenager with great maturity and self- assurance. Nick Krause as Alexandra's dim-witted stoner boyfriend brings such levity and humor to his sweet but stereotypical role. He channels Keanu Reeves laid-back spirit rather well. Beau Bridges as Matt's Cousin Hugh and Robert Forster as Matt's exasperated and angry father-in-law, and Matthew Lillard as Matt's rival add their individual imprint to the creative mix of personalities involved within the family dynamics.Of course, none of this could have succeeded as well without the perceptive and adroit script by Payne ( with Nat Faxon and Jim Rash ). The screenplay layers the dialog in a completely naturalistic way and has developed fully dimensional characters to which the movie audience can actually relate. However, Payne's direction, though efficient, is somewhat routine, relying on too many close-ups and voice-overs that tend to overplay the action. He directs in a very straight-forward manner, lacking in much bravado style and finesse with no flashy camera-work or special effects to impress. Yet it is his story and verbal exchanges that empower this wonderful film. Words, rather than visual imagery, are his forte and, on that level, Payne truly excels.The film focuses on the sense of regret, the unavoidable changes that happen to us all, and life always spinning out of our control. It is a film of restraint and quiet insights that effectively mixes the sweet with the bitter and shows its flawed characters as merely individuals in need of each other, in search of a connection. With its inspired casting, clever screenplay, and solid direction, The Descendants ascends toward the top of my list as one of the best films of the year.

86,Seraphion,Great acting in a drama in Hawaii setting,7,4 January 2015,"The story opens up very slowly and gains pace a little while after. The side plot presented so very early at the beginning really makes the finale rather predictable after the main conflict is revealed just right after Alex' return. The movie spirals down into more of a detective movie than a family drama for some time and then it hit jackpot by the lucky pass by at the beach.Then the whole clashes of conflicts sets in right after all those neatly built main and sub plot. The acting is great in overall for me. George CLooney nicely depicted the combination of a distressed and estranged father, saddened and disappointed yet still determined husband, and the enigmatic decision maker at the end. Shailene Woodley acted out her grown up too soon role well, that her father sometimes cooperate with to have the tracking of Speer easier.",The Descendants
87,Movie-ManDan,The Movie Could Not Have Been Better. George Clooney's Finest Hour.,10,6 March 2017,"Despite being one of the biggest stars Hollywood has seen in over twenty years, I've never been fond of George Clooney. He's pretty overrated. Some of his movies are awesome, but he went much of a standout. Ocean's Eleven was a dazzling film, but Clooney didn't do much for me. He won an Oscar for 2005's Syriana, but I didn't think Clooney was good in it. Only in Michael Clayton and Up In The Air was I impressed with his talents and only then did I see what his fans have always loved. This review may be six-years-too-late, but I am thoroughly proud of what George Clooney brings to the table and I hold this movie in higher regard than most.Most reviews of this film say that it could have been better and that Clooney might not have been the best choice. Could somebody else have done better? Sure. But then I would not have a Clooney performance that I could call ""truly remarkable."" As for the other stuff this movie has, every time I thought more should be done or something could have changed, it did right away. This movie read my mind. George Clooney stars as Matt King. His family has lived in Hawaii for generations, and him and his relatives own thousands of acres of land. He works as a realty lawyer who tries to raise his two daughters properly. He wants to give them enough money to do stuff, but not too much to do nothing. That's perfect. He doesn't want them to grow up to be spoiled rich brats. Despite not having a strong relationship with them, he evidently tries.The movie opens up with Matt's wife Elizabeth being involved in a boating accident where she falls in a irreversible coma and is given only weeks to live. Matt is heartbroken, and scared that his girls will grow up without their mother. He takes his rebellious teenage daughter named Alexandra from a boarding school to spend as much time together as possible before all ends. So far, it seems to be a light-hearted family drama about his father wanting to reconnect with his estranged daughters. Well that is what the movie is about, but it takes drastic turn into sheer originality that is executed to perfection.Alexandra and her mother did not get along at all. Their bitterness started when she found her mother with another man. That man is Realtor Brian Speer. Speer is surprisingly well-played by Matthew Lillard. I'm so used to seeing him as jokesters like in Scream and Scooby Doo, but this change for him is well-suited. Matt wants to find out exactly who Speer is, and so does his daughter. Remember when I said the movie is about a father wanting to reconnect with his daughters? Well their common ground is seeking the culprit that broke their family apart. Along the way, shocking truths about Elizabeth and Speer arise that are very heartbreaking. But at the same time, she's a vegetable. Being near death really takes emotional tolls on Matt and his family. This whole situation is enough to prevent his daughters from becoming brats. And Matt wanting revenge on Speer was perfectly set up. We all know not much will happen (Matt won't beat him to a bloody pulp or anything like that), but enough emotion is stirred up around Speer's subplot that is just as strong as the main. I totally love what the movie tackles. Usually when people die, others mourn. But with Elizabeth, she was not a very good woman. Is is honourable to bash a soon-to-be-dead person? I also love the blossoming relationship with Matt and his daughters, and the subplot with Brian Speer. The icing on the cake is the beautiful images of Hawaii culture. The boarders in the credits lets you know that you are in for a good time. The sun shining, the palm trees, the acres of land, all of these prevent you from looking away. Not impressed with the story? Well the movie contains images too beautiful to turn away from. And the crown jewel is George Clooney. He was nominated for an Oscar, but lost. I honestly thought he was the best of the year. Here is a movie made to perfection. **** out of ****",The Descendants
88,raulfaust,'Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you...,6,2 July 2012,"""The Descendants"" is a light drama that follows the style of ""The Kids Are All Right""-- not that the plot is the same or anything, but the way it runs. Matt King (George Clooney) is about to lose his wife when he discovers she's been cheating on him, which delivers some funny moments. Alex (his daughter) is a bad humored teenager initially, but as the film goes she shows she has maturity. Although this story doesn't bring anything new to the genre and nothing much really happens, this movie is great in character development and entertainment. Most scenes are slow but you get interested in the story, which makes time flies. All the cast is professional and I don't understand why so many bad reviews towards Clooney's acting. All in all, this is a good family comedy with few drama moments with a simple yet beautiful last scene-- family reunited in the sofa sharing the same blanket and food.",The Descendants
89,bob-rutzel-1,Very Good Story,7,14 March 2012,"Matt King's (George Clooney) wife Elizabeth (Patricia Hastie) had a boating accident and is in a coma. Now he has to find a way to deal with his daughters, who were closest to their mother; and then he learns Elizabeth was having an affair and would have divorced him. On top of all that, he has a big decision to make: to sell or keep 25,000 acres of prime Hawaiian real estate before the trust runs out; and most of the family wants him to sell. Matt King has a lot on his plate. George Clooney does a remarkable job as one in shock trying to keep everything together knowing he has mountains to climb to get next to his daughters plus just finding out that his wife was about to leave him before the accident. He has an amazing ability to convey his emotions via his facial expressions and we really don't need a lot of his dialogue to see this. We care for him and hope all turns out well. An unexpected alliance with eldest daughter Alex (Shailena Woodley) has a somewhat stabilizing effect. This is a good story and the acting by all is exceptional. Yes, there is a lot of language in the beginning mostly by the older daughter Alex, who has issues with Matt and also with her mother who is still in a coma. Children using foul language seems to be a common trend now in Hollywood movies, and I guess that tells children and adults who see this movie it's okay now to spout off in this way. Hollywood has taken to heart the ploy of the Camel's head in the tent. Pretty soon it will be open season for children to use foul language so get ready to see the entire Camel inside that tent. We see many beautiful shots of the landscapes in Hawaii, and we wished there could have been more. However, since the setting is Hawaii, we did expect to see some shots of surfers in heavy surf and some hula dancers. Didn't happen although there was that opportunity. Some quick shots is all we asked for. Was that too much to ask ? Apparently so. The accompanying Hawaiian music was good and appropriate at times. There were some attempts at comic relief in here with Nick Krause as Sid, Alex's boyfriend. When he wasn't annoying, he was pretty good. George Clooney was nominated for Best Actor. Didn't get it. The movie was nominated for Best Picture, Best Editing, and Best Director. Didn't happen. It did win an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay and that made sense.There should be an Oscar for Best Facial Expressions as sometimes the whole story can be seen right there. And, if there were such an Oscar, George Clooney would win hands down. (7/10)Violence: Not really, but Sid (Krause) is popped in the face.

90,bkrauser-81-311064,Trouble in Paradise,7,24 November 2011,"Director Alexander Payne's newest opus to the human condition hits familiar territory from his previous work in ""About Schmidt"" and ""Sideways."" But unlike his earlier outings he wisely removes his signature savage satire to tell a remarkably simple story with a lot of heart.The film begins with lawyer Matt King (George Clooney) who has a lot on his plate. After an unfortunate boating accident, King's wife has fallen into a deteriorating coma to which the doctors say she will never wake up. King then brings Alexandra (Shailene Woodley), his teenage daughter home from rehab to make the rounds to friends and family while taking care of his youngest daughter Scottie (Amara Miller). She then drops a bomb that will change all of their lives forever. To make matters more complicated, the principle story is told over the backdrop of an important land deal which Clooney is the sole decider.The conclusions of these multiple strands of story all unravel unexpectedly and with a great deal of pathos. Set on location in Hawaii, the exotic location juxtaposes itself with the very human characters and their very human problems. By making even the more cutthroat characters fully fleshed out, Alexander Payne makes a relatively straightforward story a messy tale about love, family and fidelity.George Clooney is surprisingly effective as a bourgeois land baron trying desperately to keep his head above water. The real revelation however is Shailene Woodley who brings depth to the familiar surly teenager trope. Instead of simply tagging along for the ride, her character grows intelligently and in tandem with George Clooney's making their reunion as a family all the more satisfying.My review is not without its scruples however. The music (This time not provided by Rolfe Kent) was a little distracting. Nick Krause's ""friend"" character is first seen as an annoying stereotype. As the story progresses the film attempts to make him better realized but this is met with mixed results. Additionally actress Amara Miller has great instincts for someone her age but is given very little screen time to develop her character.Ultimately however, ""The Descendants"" is a wonderful film. It's poignant, effective and gentle and provokes genuine un-coaxed emotion.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/",The Descendants

And don't get us started on how many awards the good looker has bagged. After winning the Best Supporting Actor Oscar with 2005's Syriana, he could be completing the collection with a Best Actor accolade at this year's Academy Awards. After being nominated for his leading roles in Michael Clayton (2007) and Up in the Air (2009), Gorgeous George could be the one taking home that statuette this year, thanks to his heartfelt performance in this comedy drama.Seriously, who else can look so dazzling wearing Hawaiian T shirts?Based on Kaul Hart Hemmings' novel of the same name, Clooney plays a Hawaiian land baron who takes his daughters on a trip from Oahu to Kauai. This isn't a family holiday, however, as the successful businessman's main objective is to confront the man who was having an affair with his wife. The heart wrenching part? The woman is on life support after a boating accident and she may not survive the misfortune.Before you think this is one sob story which contains an intolerable amount of melodrama, let us assure you that this is one genuinely affecting film which will make you laugh, cry, and most importantly, tug at your heartstrings. After all, the production is directed by Alexander Payne, the man who brought you About Schmidt (2002) and Sideways (2004). Together with Nax Faxon and Jim Rash, the Oscar winning writer director has penned a screenplay that is both funny and moving.Payne does not rush into things, having enough screen time to develop his characters. You'll find yourself being nicely acquainted to Clooney's protagonist, as he tells you how Hawaii isn't the paradise every one perceives it to be. There are problems and issues which are faced by people in any other part of the world. In this instance, he has one huge problem of dealing with a dying wife, two rebellious daughters, a adulterer who slept with his wife, a disapproving father in law and a rowdy teenager whom his elder daughter insists on bringing along for the trip.This is one load of mess which you won't ever want to find yourself in. Yet, thanks to Clooney's suave portrayal of the troubled man, you see hope and possibility in this confused times. His perfect Golden Globes winning performance is complemented by an ensemble of supporting cast, including the luminous Shailene Woodley (TV's The O.C.) as the defiant elder daughter, the adorable first time child actor Amara Miller as the younger daughter, as well as Matthew Lillard (Scooby Doo) and Judy Greer (13 Going on 30) as the unfaithful man and his unknowing wife.The newly crowned Best Picture (Drama) at this year's Golden Globes is a touching examination on how you take that journey in life when it throws you off balance.

93,valadas,Regret,7,22 January 2012,"After seeing lots of movies with bombs, explosions, shots, attacks, computer special violent side effects et alia it's good to see a movie where there is nothing of that and only feelings and sentiments (most often good ones), nice images, excellent acting and meaningful dialogues and behaviours. A married woman is in hospital in a deep coma after a boat accident when her husband knows from their eldest daughter that she has been unfaithful to him with another man. This unchains a situation of great and deep emotion (though very contained and avoiding any kind of melodrama) driving the husband (George Clooney) in an obsessive mood and intention of knowing who his wife's lover was and even meeting and talking to him in which he is helped by that same daughter. The whole story is told in very humane terms involving the relationship the father maintains with her two daughters and their reactions all this in very true and psychological realistic conditions and expressions. Intertwined with this there is a heritage problem regarding the decision about selling of a large land inherited by the main character's large family and which they must soon decide to sell for a fortune to be urbanized or not. All this runs in the middle of the beautiful landscape, seascape and flowers of Hawaii shown here in beautiful images. And the last scenes intend to show us that even after the worst of dramas life goes on often peacefully and quietly. This movie deals in a superb way with several aspects of nowadays life: marital and extramarital relations, filial relations, health problems, life and death, love, kids' behaviour and even business problems. And does all this in a veracious and truthful way without resorting to very dramatic scenes but to very moving ones anyway using mainly the facial expressions of characters to show us their deep emotions. But above all this movie is about the terrible regret for what you should have done for your beloved wife (or husband) and can't do anymore because she (or he) is now already dead.

Clooney does himself no favors - sure we all get that it goes against type - but it's just not an Oscar worthy performance. It's not often I feel like I'm going this much against the flow, but really it's a shallow piece of film-making that in any other year would just be glossed over. I don't know what makes me sadder that a soapy negative drama is being praised to the roof or that 2011 has been such a miserable year for film.",The Descendants
95,DeeNine-2,"Wonderfully redeeming, clever and a bit funny",10,11 March 2013,"This is the fourth Alexander Payne movie I've seen and in some ways it is the best. It is the most affecting, that's for sure, at least for me. I cried through a good part of it. What I found so touching was the way the characters came to grips with the reality of their lives and in the way the King family—Matt (George Clooney), Alexandra (Shailene Woodley) and Scottie (Amara Miller)—strengthened their family ties despite the tragedy and the various unpleasant revelations.As Elizabeth King lies dying in a deep coma after a water skiing accident, it is her workaholic husband Matt who has to take care of a slightly dysfunctional family. He is the trustee of a great Hawaiian estate on the island of Kauai that now must be sold. Getting closer to his children he first learns that younger daughter Scottie's behavior needs a lot of work. Then he goes to the Big Island where his older daughter Alexandra is at school and finds her drunk. And then he learns... Well, it's better if you see the movie and see what she tells him that so sets him off.While this is almost as funny as the other Payne movies I've seen (Election 1999, About Schmidt 2002, and Sideways 2004) it is not as satirical. Payne reaches for our hearts in this one instead of our whimsy.Clooney is excellent in a part that emphasizes his controlled and very winning leading man style. He does a lot with restraint and subtle expressiveness. Woodley (just 19 as the film was shot) played the wiser-than-her-years teen with just enough edginess and spitfire to be believable. She is so pretty that just looking at her brought me to tears. But perhaps the most natural performance was that by Amara Miller as the foul-mouthed, chubby little girl who wants to be as grownup as her big sister.Interesting to me personally were the settings on location in Hawaii since I watched the film not long after spending nearly three weeks on Oahu, Maui, Hawaii, and Kauai. I recall driving into Princeville (as Matt and family do) on Kauai and being in the exact spot at the airport as they were. And the shot of the ocean with Honolulu in the background that opened the movie brought back memories.The real strength of the movie for me though was in the script and the direction. The clever dovetailing of the plot and subplot (the search for the truth about Matt's marriage; and the disposition of the fabulous estate on Kauai) melded seamlessly together as Matt meets real estate agent (and not a nice guy), Brian Speer. Underlying the story is something deeper though, and that is the growth as human beings that we see the characters go through, especially that of Matt and Alexandra.Excellent in a minor role was Judy Greer as Brian Speer's wife.—Dennis Littrell, author of ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""",The Descendants

I have always thought The Descendants to be about a dysfunctional family dealing with accident in the family. It surely surpasses all my expectations with such a real and delightful script. Alexander Payne has written beautiful story and above all choose a perfect cast for it. Who George Clooney will rock the Hawaiian look? George Clooney has done a tremendous job as an actor, he may have lost the Oscar but surly has won again millions of hearts. Shailene Woodley is simply amazing; there are rarely performances in Hollywood where an actor shows such emotional turmoil on screen. Shailene Woodley may lose the Oscar nod but she surly has the potential to win Oscar one day. Nick Krause Aka. Sid has some of the most hilarious moments in the movie, he is super awkward and funny in a weird way... TRUST ME I did not see that coming. It's simply Superb. Now the two huge surprise castings were Matthew Lillard (Known as Stuart the Creepy Voice Killer on Scream & Shaggy in Scooby-Doo) and Judy Greer (BFF of every other Rom-Com heroine). Though I would have chosen a better guy than Matthew Lillard because of his enormous popularity as killer but still he did a decent job. But Judy Greer is a pleasant surprise; I have never seen her like this emotional and brilliant. Overall, The Descendants is a great movie, which deserves all its accolades. Highly recommended.",The Descendants

I consider myself sort of a fan of Alexander Payne, but I can say one thing for sure: I won't end up giving this one the maximum number of points, like I did the rest of his feature films. Still, this isn't bad, not at all.It's hard to say where exactly 'The descendants' goes wrong. Or actually, it doesn't go wrong, but I found the combination of drama and the comedy less compelling than what I had witnessed in Payne's previous, superior, work. Clooney in the lead didn't get as much to me as Laura Dern, Matthew Broderick, Jack Nicholson and Paul Giamatti did before him. And somehow the whole story lacks sharpness that I did see in 'Citizen Kane', 'Election', 'About Schmidt' and 'Sideways'. Still, Payne incorporates a lot of integrity into the story and surprises with the (at times brutal, at times heartwarming) candor that one may expect when looking closer at a family struck by tragedy. And there are plenty of little bits that came off just perfectly, for instance those running scenes or the interaction with the (pretty much brilliant) Sid character.Anyway, 'The descendants' is a film I would still recommend any day of the week.

Despite an otherwise depressing tale at its core – Clooney's wife is in a coma, his two misbehaving daughters aren't letting up, his extended family is pushing him to sell land that will make them rich, and, to top it all off, he then finds out his wife was being unfaithful to him – Payne's script, and the quality cast, possess impeccable comic timing. Clooney has perfected his craft over the last few years and here delivers another bold performance; his nuanced and complex character remains achingly relatable and eminently watchable. When the film explores larger themes of Hawaiian culture and ancestral ties to land it gains worthiness to be sure, however loses a portion of the intimateness built up with Clooney and co; making me wonder if Payne should've stuck exclusively with the dysfunctional and highly interesting family on show.",The Descendants

Matt (George Clooney) is a regular guy who is a trustee of thousand acres of untouched land in the island of Kaua'i, Hawaii. He learns about his wife's boat accident and soon reaches hospital only to realize that she would be permanently in coma and may survive for few days. He goes into depression trying to re-unite with his estranged daughter, Alexendra(Shailene Woodley) and 10 year old daughter , Scottie who are difficult to handle as Matt couldn't spent much time with his kids. Through Alexandra , he discovers that his wife was cheating on him. To know the person with whom his wife was having an affair, he goes to Kaua'I to find the person and confront him before she dies. Alexander Payne , director of SIDEWAYS , crafts a very beautiful , engaging film which will make you feel good once you are out of theater. The film based on a novel written by Kaui Hart Hemmings puts the protagonist in dilemma with monumental tasks to tackle and the way he handles it one by another only to realize that you should only do what your heart says. George Clooney , already won Golden Globe for his brilliant acting , sheds his glamorous avatar only to become an everyday man who deals with family life crisis. Clooney shows his emotional expressions with ease and comes out with a towering performance . He is just getting mature with each role. Performance by rest of the star cast is efficient coupled by a tight screenplay. Cinematography is outstanding capturing the beautiful locales of Hawaii. Background score is perfect that gels with the film.Overall , a very well made laid back film that you are sure going enjoy. Watch it if you like performance oriented films with tight script.

101,napierslogs,Scaling the Hawaiian country-side with tears and laughter,8,30 November 2011,"""The Descendants"" is set in Hawaii but Matt King (George Clooney) and his family are not on vacation. Far from it. King is actually in a line descended down from an old Hawaiian princess and has inherited a wealth of land. That's only the secondary the plot. The primary plot is that his wife is in a coma and he has to learn how to be a parent to his two unruly daughters. Cue the laugh track.Somehow, appropriately, it is very funny. In a feel-good sort of way, not in a slapstick kind of way. Also surprisingly, and contrary to popular belief, it does have a direction and aim. The end point is pretty vague, our hero just has to find a way to live life the best he can. But to get to that end, it doesn't actually meander. Matt King has specific obstacles which he has to overcome. Namely, retrieving his 17 year-old daughter from boarding school, convincing his 10 year-old daughter to not wear her older sister's underwear, and most importantly, finding and confronting the real estate agent that was having an affair with his wife.George Clooney looks like himself but a little more down-to-Earth and a little more down-trodden than usual. He makes you care for him and the laughs and bitter-sweet tears come easily. Just as appealing was Shailene Woodley as his 17 year-old daughter. She was the snarky, rebellious teenager, but with a warmth and understanding that made you realize it came from love and not born from Hollywood cliché.Alexander Payne has written, directed and produced a number of excellent films beginning with ""Citizen Ruth"" (1996) and ""Election"" (1999), and continuing here, 'The Descendants"" is a well written, well directed and well made film. I could end this review with the prosaic line that you will find tears and laughter on the way to meeting 'The Descendants""; however, this really isn't a prosaic film even if it does seem like one.",The Descendants

It's Payne's best movie since Election and the best film of 2011 that I've seen so far.I'm from a family that was broken up by adultery, and parts of this movie hit home. The added twist is that the wife is in a coma and is dying, making a divorce totally unnecessary. Clooney plays the lawyer, and he and his teenage daughter have to cope with saying goodbye to someone they loved, yet who they are justifiably angry with. As well, Clooney has a 10-year-old girl who is thrown into his hands, and he has no idea how to take care of her.Clooney handles his role well, in spite of what I've heard about his inability to do crying scenes. The girls are honestly and sympathetically depicted, and the setting of Hawaii helps give the film some colour as well as pleasing scenery. The emotion in the film varies by scene and character; ultimately it might be characterized as bittersweet. Like Little Miss Sunshine and The Royal Tenenbaums before it, The Descendants is another movie that succeeds in capturing a family warts and all, while at the same time managing a few chuckles.",The Descendants
104,sharky_55,So what do you have to say for yourself?,7,25 January 2018,"Payne's pathetic leading men tell the stories of backstage stars, the forgotten roles, the lives outside of the limelight. They're visibly and mentally past their prime, although they're not always happy to admit the fact. How does Clooney's Matt King fit in with this echelon of middle-aged men yet to come of age? He's too good looking, for one. Did I say leading men? Payne's muses are more like character actors that aspire to be leads; the sidekick from Sideways is actually a former heart-throb gone to seed, who relies on the odd woman to notice his fading good looks and small claim to fame. Clooney, on the other hand, has only ripened with age, still the gold standard for a Hollywood sex symbol. He might not be up to it physically (and the film makes light of this in a painful jog slash speedwalk), but in spite of his opening monologue (which should be laced with bitterness but ends up more satisfied), Matt King seems to have it all. Why have the monologue, anyway? Payne's always been a great director of actors, and although the technique's been used to good effect before (Nicholson's entire series of letters in About Schmidt is a revelation in slow growing humility), these men have always told more through body language and action. I guess Clooney doesn't have the same gravitas of a Nicholson or a Giamatti, who channel their mid or late life crisis through physical decay and a panicked realisation at what they haven't achieved. Clooney may run funny, but he's too casually dashing to convincingly portray someone at odds with his entire family, much less someone work obsessed and liable to be cheated on. His persona made much more sense in Up in the Air, an incentive-driven, one man crusade set to disprove the 'no man is an island' mantra, so focused on a single number he eventually begins to doubt himself. In many ways The Descendants is Payne's weakest film to date, a clunky mishmash of Payne's better marks, like the sharp edge of a comic satire in Election, and the dissection of red-faced protagonists who splutter and stumble their way to an eventual understanding of their flaws and features. There's so much secondhand embarrassment in the desperate appeals of his earlier characters for lost glory; their lives are mishap after mishap, and after a while they're not sure whether to laugh or collapse into a miserable heap. The Descendants, by contrast, seems rather embarrassed of these characters' downfalls, not content to allow scenes to simply wallow in their melancholy. It's dripping in bathos; almost every moment of sentimentality has to be livened or 'saved' by comic relief. The most annoying intrusion is Sid, the inappropriately-stoned boyfriend walking straight out of a raunchy comedy, with the tact of a whooping megaphone. When Judy Greer forgives Elizabeth in a tearful eulogy near the end, Matt is visibly embarrassed by this show of emotion; he's the deceased's husband and yet hasn't cried this much over the whole affair. But his quick move to usher the hysterical woman out of the hospital room is flippant enough that the moment is more comedic than introspective. Payne doesn't hang Matt out to dry as much as his other protagonists, perhaps because his unique situation is an ethical dilemma for the ages. The entire movie is a painful journey for closure that may never be found; how exactly do you extract answers from a soon-to-be corpse, much less hurl angry abuse that will forever fall on deaf ears? Matt finds strength in having to replace Elizabeth's role as the available parent, and in his journey goes from someone whose dialogue is written like a babysitter's, to someone who finally finds common ground with his family and heritage. How it all goes down is a little hokey - that precious, delicate ceremony where they spread her ashes at sea - but then Payne finishes with one of the most startlingly realised endings of his oeuvre, depicting a family that hasn't quite gotten over what they've been through, but has survived and will continue to do so together.",The Descendants

Along with Clooney, Robert Forster is great as a bitter old man, yet his bitterness is at the very least partly understandable, and that is what this gets so right in that every character is a real person with actual flaws, and both good and bad tropes interwoven into them all. It would have been easy for this to fall into a well cast TV drama movie, but it's way too well put together for that with its gentle pace, nice observations, a few good laughs, and brilliant writing.

But it leaves you feeling enriched because there is so much more than grief and tragedy. The Descendants just left me feeling depressed. Despite being tempted to turn it off several times, I stuck with it hoping for some sort of joyful or inspiring ending. There isn't.

Matt confesses, ""Everything has its time."" Writer and Director Alexander Payne's ""The Descendants"" is funny, poignant, and life affirming eloquence. ""The Descendants"" is by far the best movie of the year! George Clooney is awesome, giving his best performance, ever. As Matt he is powerful and courageous baring such raw emotion with characteristic charm, and striking authentic humanity. There is a scene where a tear streams down Clooney's cheek as he tells his wife, ""Goodbye"" that had me in tears. Clooney deserves Best Actor for his heart felt and inspiring performance. Shailene Woodley is amazing as Alex. She is so natural and strong. Her partnership with Clooney, along with Alexander Payne's brilliantly restrained direction makes ""The Descendants"" very special.""The Descendants"" distinguishes Alexander Payne's return to the movies since his ""Sideways"". Payne wrote the screenplay along with Nat Faxon and Jim Rash based on the novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings. Hemmings also appears as Matt's secretary. There are other great local touches. Surfer legend Laird Hamilton has a key role. My friend Jon's Mom's house is on screen as Matt and Alex drive through Diamond Head. The movie trailer does not do justice to the depth and richness of ""The Descendants"". In fact not until you watch the movie does it become transparent the significance of the title. Payne's ""The Descendants"" is funny, sad, and inspiring—like life.George Clooney plays Honolulu transactional law attorney Matt King. Matt is the sole Trustee of the family Hawaiian Lands Estate that dates back to the Kamehameha monarchy. Matt diligently manages the sale of the Estate before the Trust expires in 7 years, looking to broker the optimum deal for his numerous cousins. Matt is earnest and dedicated, not exploiting any trust money, choosing to live off his income as a successful attorney. Tragedy strikes. Matt's wife Elizabeth (Patricia Hastie) is in a coma following a boating accident. Matt doesn't really know his daughters 10 year-old Scottie (Miller) and 17 year-old Alex (Woodley), admitting ""I'm the backup parent."" Scottie is not coping well with her Mom's crisis sending a bullying text to her friend. Matt and Scottie retrieve older sister Alex on the Big Island where she is attending a special school to deal with her drug addiction, something she may have inherited with her Mom. They find Alex not high, but drunk.Elizabeth's doctor tells Matt that his wife will not recover from the coma. Her will instructs the termination of life support—she will die. Painfully, Matt tells Alex her Mom's fate. Woodley is sublime as she literally submerges into tragic despair. Later tearful Alex unloads emotional bombshell, ""Mom was cheating on you."" Clooney is amazing as the look on his face transforms from disbelief to sheer despair and anger, peeling down the road in his rubber slippers. Payne always balances the paradox with panic and humor.First order of business: Matt must tell his disapproving Father-in-Law Scott (strong unforgiving Robert Forster) about Elizabeth. Scott's wife suffers from Alzheimer's. From Scott's point of view Elizabeth was the perfect faithful wife, who deserved a better lifestyle from Matt. Matt and Alex determine that the other man is real estate broker Brian Speer (selfish Matthew Lillard). The King's along with Alex's ex-Punahou classmate Sid (stoner charming Nick Krause) in tow head off to Kauai to search for Brian. Sid is an apparent goof, who Matt tells ""You are a 100 miles from smart."" However, Payne generously distinguishes that the people in your life will often surprise you with their greatness—their innate nobility and compassion. Forster and Krause display their quiet heroic best. Also surprising is Judy Greer as Brian's wife Julie—comedic and dramatic genius. Amara Miller is so great in a heart wrenching moment as the hospital doctor tells her about her Mom. Everything in ""The Descendants"" feels true and just so.Everything has its time. In ""The Descendants"" life happens and life goes on. The highest praise for Clooney: He would make a great Dad. At narrative arc his Matt tells Cousin Hugh (laid back Beau Bridges), ""Just trying to keep my head above water."" Matt doesn't always know what to do, and Clooney makes this work embodying his courage and compassion. The last scene of ""The Descendants"" is eloquence beyond words. Life goes on. Love those who are dear to you. ""The Descendants"" poignantly reminds us of this.",The Descendants
108,TOMASBBloodhound,Payne does it again.,9,31 March 2012,"Alexander Payne is definitely one of the best filmmakers walking the earth today. Though he doesn't make the kind of films that pack multi-plexes with screaming children and distracted parents, he gives true movie buffs something hard to find these days. His films are often complex character studies with interesting casting choices. I'd venture a guess that Payne allows some scenes to play out in which ever direction the actors take them. That type of film may rarely lead to box office success, but its good that someone keeps financing his projects, and that good actors are willing to participate.The Descendants is a complex starring George Clooney and the islands of Hawai'i. Clooney plays a lawyer with a lot going on in his life. His wife has just been seriously injured in a boating accident. She is in a deep coma we learn early on that she will not recover from. The couple's living will states that in this case, the plug must be pulled in such a circumstance. The loss of his wife means that Clooney will have to re-connect more strongly than ever with his two daughters when they have always been much closer with their mother. Clooney is also the trustee of several thousand acres of pristine Hawai'ian coast land which his relatives want him to sell, as they will also reap millions of dollars if he does. Things are further complicated as Clooney learns from his eldest daughter that his wife had been having a serious affair with a real estate broker who also could make a fortune if this land sale goes through. Since the wife's fate is already decided, Clooney and his daughters spend the majority of the film attempting to find and confront the man she was having the affair with. This leads to several unpredictable scenes and lots of different emotions from the different characters.The Descendants is quite a richly rewarding experience. As always, Payne has made some interesting casting choices beyond Clooney who is as good as ever. Where had Robert Forster been hiding all these years? I had to look him up from the movie The Black Hole just to remember what his name was! And Beau Bridges is a welcome sight. It would be nice if Jeff's recent success would lead to more from Beau. I'd never heard of Shailene Woodley before, but I suspect we will hear plenty more from her in the future. The land of Hawai'i also plays a major role. Payne doesn't always film it in the way one would expect to see it. Instead of excessive glamor shots of white sandy beaches rimmed with blue water, Payne more often than not goes for the more subtle shots of the islands' beauty. And he definitely scores points for showing some of the unique aspects of the behaviors of local residents. This is not a film about how tourists behave or where they hang out on vacation. This is another fine film from Payne. Definitely looking forward to his next one. 9 of 10 stars.The Hound.",The Descendants

110,cultfilmfan,The Descendants,8,13 December 2011,"The Descendants is based upon the novel of the same name by Kaui Hart Hemmings. The film focuses on a middle aged man named Matt King, who both bonds and learns more about himself and his two daughters Alexandra and Scottie, during a family crisis. I do not want to give too much away about The Descendants because even just giving away a little information could spoil the whole movie for you and I do not want to go that route. Many other reviews I have read are more specific about what the movie is about, but also give away a lot of spoilers in the process, so if that is the way you want to go, you have lots of different critics to read. Anyways, there were quite a few things I did like about The Descendants, but I did not feel it was a perfect film and in a sense I am a bit surprised at all the love the film is getting from critics and different awards ceremonies. I did like the film and found the acting to be quite good all around and the story was interesting enough and kept me entertained, but I just could not connect with the film the way I wanted to and the way I thought I would. The film deals with some fairly heavy and depressing issues that face the family in this film and instead of feeling any emotion for them, whether it be sadness, joy, or basically any feelings at all, I did not feel anything. I did not think that the writing was strong enough for us to connect to any of these characters, or their situations on a personal level, so it left me instead feeling cold and uncaring towards them, which is not what I wanted to feel, but due to vague and subdued writing and character study, that is exactly how I did feel. When you have a film dealing with heavy issues and when you are trying to get the audience to care for your characters and feel with them, laugh and cry with them, you have to make your characters worthy of empathy and sympathy and allow the audience to some how connect with those characters during the film. Instead of doing that, during the duration of this film I always felt distant with them. It was not like I was in a room with them dealing with the issues they were, but instead it felt like I was watching a movie, or a television soap opera, just with better acting. The other reason for this is that the film feels too glossy and polished for this type of subject matter. The film looks and feels like a major Hollywood production, even though it is considered an independent film and if it had been done on a more low key level, say even cinema verite, or a documentary type feel and not using beautiful spotlight type actors and had they improved the chemistry you had with the characters, then I could see this film working, but instead the whole thing feels like you are watching a movie and none of it feels real or resonates with those watching it. Also the fact that the film takes place and is filmed in Hawaii is fine except for the part that I felt it was distracting and also took away from the story. It further made everything look glamorous and beautiful and took away from the pain and feelings that the characters were feeling and including an upbeat and peppy Hawaiian soundtrack did not help either. The Descendants did have good acting and I was never bored, or uninterested in what I was watching, but just could not ever connect with it, so a lot of it was lost on me unfortunately.",The Descendants

Suffice to say that, if mismanaged, the thing which turned out to be so ordinary would have otherwise dumped a unneeded burden of guilt and shame on Clooney's character, but as with so many of these delicious slices of verite, the pulling back from that brink is like yet-another azure wave receding from glimmering white sands.It's wonderfully produced, directed, acted. I loved the VO work; because the thing is, after all, a fine story, the VO feels right.

Including, if you let it, the tabernacle of your own heart.Watch, cry, laugh, enjoy.I would like to add a more pedestrian note: It really warms the cockles of my heart to see Clooney picking and choosing his roles with such a clear eye for quality, warmth, humanity, and artfulness, and having it obviously pan out for him so well.

I didn't have much of an idea about the storyline of the Descendants before seeing it. There's no doubt that this definitely isn't an up-beat movie and if you like your movies sugar coated this is probably one to avoid.The story follows a father Matt King (Clooney) coming to terms with his wife being in a coma. This means that he has to take care of his two daughters who are both dysfunctional even before their mother suffers the accident.I didn't really have any empathy with any of the characters and consequently found the movie a bit of a struggle.

114,itamarscomix,Don't believe the hype,4,16 February 2012,"Once again - third time in a row! - Alexander Payne manages to fool everyone into thinking he created a great piece of art. Just like Sideways and About Schmidt, The Descendants is a pretentious, pompous drama masquerading as a dramedy. Like Paul Giamatti and Jack Nicholson, respectively, in those two movies, George Clooney's Matt King is an unlikable, whiny character placed in unrelatable and far-fetched situation. Unlike those two, though, King has no redeeming features, and the movie has no sense of humor to help us along - Nick Krause is brought along for some attempt at comic relief which is mainly irritating and repulsive. King is an egotistical, privileged, self-centered, bad father, bad husband, rich bum, and Clooney indeed does a pretty good job playing him - for a supporting character. Unfortunately, Payne constantly drills into our heads that he's the protagonist and that for some reason we're supposed to root for him and, worse, feel sorry for him.There is nothing likable about Matt King, or about his bratty daughters, played by Shailene Woodley and Amara Miller, who obviously got their stubbornness and ungratefulness from their father. There is nothing the least bit relatable about his condition or his action, and I was never for a second convinced that I should sympathize with him rather than his dying wife, whose character is so flat and gets so little characterization that she may have been in a coma when she was alive, too, for all we know or care. Alexander Payne buys the critics and the award shows with fake emotion, bad people and hypocrisy. Usually I'd call a movie like Sideways, which gains a lot of hype despite mediocre quality, an overrated or over-hyped movie; The Descendants is a bad one. If it wins the Best Picture Oscar as it did the Golden Globe I'll lose what little respect I have for the American film industry.",The Descendants

116,gelman@attglobal.net,"Excellent Film, Well Acted: SPOILER ALERT",9,28 November 2011,"George Clooney has been justifiably lauded for his role as Matt King in ""The Descendants,"" but the surprise in this film is Shailene Woodley, who plays Alex, his 17-year-old daughter. She perfectly captures every emotion that the story requires her to display. Not since Keira Knightley made her debut in ""Bend It Like Beckham"" has a fresh new face shown such star quality.Since it is revealed immediately, I'm not spoiling anything by reporting that this complicated movie is about a woman, Elizabeth King, who's been in an accident that will prove fatal and the impact of her impending death on her husband, daughters and (more incidentally) her parents. Clooney, her husband, is the ranking member of the large King clan that dates back to Hawaii's beginning and owns an immense property on one of the islands. The property is held in trust and Matt alone has the power to decide what to do with it, which is worth an enormous amount of money and which most members of the family are determined to sell.Matt, confronted with his wife's situation, acknowledges that he's been an inattentive father and must now take full responsibility for Alex and for Scottie (Amanda Heller), her eight-year-old sister. Alex (Woodley) is in full rebellion, consigned to a prep school on another island where she seems to be majoring in alcohol, drugs, ignoring curfew and sex. Her father flies in to bring her home, leaving Scottie in a friend's care. Alex's first reaction when she finds her mother in a coma is to release a hate-filled tirade. She quickly reveals that her conflict with her mother has been prompted by discovery of her mother's infidelity. The rest of the story takes off from this revelation, which comes as a total shock to Matt and sends him off, with his daughters in tow, to find his wife's lover. Meanwhile, in the background and at times in the foreground, Matt must decide what to do about the family- owned property. Part of the action takes place on or near the property, giving Alexander Payne, the director, and his team opportunities to show some of Hawaii's great beauty.As the story deepens and Matt learns the identity of his wife's lover with an assist from Alex, we witness the daughter's transformation as she takes care of her younger sister, empathizes with her father and even comes to terms with her mother who will never awake from her coma. But Alex is not transformed instantly or completely. Through the deepening of the story until the very end, she takes along her boyfriend , Sid (Nick Krause), a particularly insensitive teenage jerk who can't even suppress a laugh when Alex's distressed grandfather, Elizabeth's father, says something which Sid considers funny.Matt's progression is on a different level than Alex's. Having identified Elizabeth's lover, a real estate man who stands to make a lot of money if the King family property is sold, Matt invites him to come see her for one last time at the hospital, but refrains from the easy path to revenge which would be to tell his wife. Matt decides, however, not to sell the family property -- and one is left to wonder whether a factor in that decision might not have been to keep his wife's lover from earning his commission. At the end, Matt forgives his wife, affirms his love and kisses her on the lips. Clooney, like Cary Grant before him, is so good-looking and charming that he is underrated as an actor. His performance in this film is outstanding, and he seems certain to be nominated for an Oscar as best actor. Ms. Woodley has not received a lot of notice from the critics and will probably not be nominated. But she WILL be a star. She has the looks and the presence, and she is a very capable young actor.",The Descendants

119,nicholas.rhodes,Globally satisfying but weak plot,7,19 July 2012,"The main strong point of this film is that for once we are preserved from violence, blood, gore, sex and and special effects which have pervaded a large part of the cinema and can only quite frankly interest a limited number of people on the planet.Personally I have always been fascinated by Hawaii, but for a European this place is across the other side of the earth and very difficult to access. I am keen to visit the place to hear their music, eat the local delicacies and photograph the flowers and mountains. My uncle has a time-share there and he speaks some of the local language ! This film shows us a lot of different views of the islands and the climate, given the lush vegetation, seems to be quite changeable with an ever changing sky between rain and sun. One must suppose that one of the film's aims is to show that even in such a peaceful paradise such as Hawai'I, pain and grief are possible.The film's plot is very limited but Clooney's actor performance in the role assigned to him is very good indeed - for this reason at the end of the film, you feel ""highly satisfied"" which is not the same as ""enthralled"" : to feel the latter you would have needed a spicier plot which just wasn't there. As to Clooney's wife in the film – I could not imagine being paid to act in a film and to spend the whole of that film motionless in a bed ? Could they not have used a lifelike dummy ?? As we never saw the woman ""in action"" during the film even by use of flashbacks, it is difficult for the spectator to feel any real emotion for her and we have more emotion in following the way Clooney apprehends the situation thrust upon him.One very negative point is the frequent use of absolutely foul and vulgar language by the children. Is this typical of American children nowadays ? Or was it exaggerated for the film ? Whatever the reply to that question, it does absolutely no good for the film at all and the only effect it would have would be to repulse certain would-be viewers who would have otherwise liked the film. How I relish the older films from the 1940's and 1950's where this filth was totally absent and the film far more enjoyable. Even in fighting/violent scenes, people seemed to control their language.A good point with ""Descendants""was the lovely Hawaiian music – I have collected quite a few CD's of this bought overseas and I am fascinated by the culture mix these islands have produced.Globally I have a satisfactory appreciation of the film which can be put down to Clooney's excellent performance and the magnificent surroundings and music and whilst you feel sad that the poor wife is confined to a bed with the unenviable prospect of death at the end of the tunnel, this sadness is tempered by the fact that we learn she was cheating on her husband. And cheating with who ? One of the killers from ""Scream"". Your emotions are slightly ""numbed"".",The Descendants
120,jdkraus,"Tear jerking, touching, powerful, engaging, yet missing something",9,27 December 2011,"""The Descendants"" is not meant to be an entertaining movie, nor is its goal to be a pure tearjerker (thought this film has some elements of both), but rather it's objective is to reflect a family dealing with a tragedy and the repercussions it causes. Keeping the film's plot to a minimal, it is about Matt King (George Clooney), a Hawaiian land baron whose wife ends up in a coma via a boating accident. While trying to a close a deal that could get him rich, he tries to take care of his two rambunctious daughters, 17-year old Alexandra (Shailene Woodley) and 10-year old Scottie (new comer Amara Miller). In addition, he has to handle estranged family members and also learns the truth that his wife was having an affair. This movie sounds like a typical family drama along the lines of ""Ordinary People,"" but I assure you that it is not. The focus is drawn solely on George Clooney as he delivers a roller-coaster of emotions. There are so many great scenes in this movie that show this man's talent. One that comes to mind is when he learns the news that his wife was going to die. Shock, despair, disbelief, and even a hint of anger develop on his face. He maintains these emotions so well that at this part, I no longer see the great movie star George Clooney. I see a middle-aged man who's thrown into a matter that any person can and possibly may have experiencedtragedy of a loved one. This man deserves the Best Actor at this coming year's Oscars. Though the lead, Clooney is not the only driving force. There is a great supporting cast. Shailene Woodley steals the show as 17-year old Alexandra. She at first comes off as a foulmouthed, belligerent teen, but as the plot progresses, her character grows and matures as she helps her dad in not only keeping the family together, but also assist in trying to find the man who had an affair with her mother. She'll be looking at a nomination too. Amara Miller plays a good brat, but she maintains a hint of likeness as a comic relief. Nick Krause as Sid, Alexandra's boyfriend, comes off at first as an ass, but like Alexandra, he matures as the plot progresses and becomes an unlikely ally for the King family.The script and direction is well thought out and brilliantly executed. Though slow moving, the story never gets dry or uneventful. The composition shots, whether it be the tight close-ups or beautiful landscapes are flawless. The music creates a nice undertone and feel for the movie, but I could have done without the Hawaiian vocals. One thing that I wished Alexander Payne put into this movie was the perspective of the comatose wife. I think it would have made this movie even more impactful if there were scenes of tension between her and the family, as well as how she was driven into the arms of another man. Giving a personality to the wife would have made a sadder and more powerful film. Since there is no back-story in her character, I feel nothing for her. She's just a body lying in a hospital bed, as shown vividly in this film. This may have extended the length a bit, but it certainly would have made it a better feature in my mind. Then again, Alexander Payne's objective is to focus on those affected by her condition, not her.""The Descendants"" is one of those movies you'll want to leave the kids at home and go see. Purely an adult movie, it'll play with your emotions and may strike home to those of you who have ever lost a loved one.",The Descendants

Added to that he is negotiating a tricky land sale that could split his family wide open, so he does not have crises to seek. But he gets another...Payne once again tells the tale of a man of a certain advanced age reaching a crossroads in his life. He tells these tales well, but the fact is Payne's weakest outing so far has received, ironically, the most attention. Who said the star system was dead? Clooney's presence has somehow wangled Oscar nominations for Best Actor and Best Picture. Certainly, in the latter category, this is an indicator of how lite the field is this year. The Descendants is a good film, but not a great one. Payne famously knocked Clooney back for the failed actor role in Sideways - an astute decision - and while he gets to stretch his acting legs somewhat here, it is more Clooney being Clooney than putting in a performance.The film gets off to a bad start with a on-the-nose narration that would barely scrape a passing grade at Screen writing school. Who people are, why they dress the way they do, what challenges our hero Matt King is now faced with and how he feels about them are relayed matter-of-factly as if the medium were a radio play. The pace meanders as Matt attempts to fix the disconnect with his daughters, especially troubled teen Alexandra (Shailene Woodley in the movie's stand-out performance). Things are not helped when she brings along her boyfriend, an oaf so clumsily scribbled into the script for comic relief that a script reader or producer somewhere should be fired for letting him get to screen.Some funny moments, some touching ones, but on a sentimental, melodramatic level rather than a cathartic one. About Schmidt and Sideways stayed with me, but The Descendants will fade rapidly. To be honest, it already has.",The Descendants
122,JohnRayPeterson,Simply a good movie about a not so ordinary family.,8,8 March 2012,"The movie has the feel of a good novel; not surprising since it's based on Kaui Hart Hemmings' novel. By all accounts, she wrote what she is familiar with and that always gives one an edge. I'm not surprised the movie made the Oscars' contender list; it was in the same class as most of the others. I loved the story; the characters are interesting and unless you don't like George Clooney to start with or character development pieces, you're bound to like this movie.The setting, Hawaii, goes a long way in eye pleasing scenery and this movie took advantage of it, but without overdoing it. I'll always remember my visit of the island of Oahu and the superb weather, so this movie brought back good memories. Now the characters in the movie are not outrageous and are very believable, thanks to the performances of the key actors. I did not know, before watching the movie, that Beau Bridges and Robert Foster would be among the supporting cast, so I was very pleased with that; they did more than bring their names to the table, they did a splendid job with their parts. Clooney was rightfully proud of his work. Shailene Woodley and Amara Miller in the roles of Clooney's daughters were terrific, which is my way of saying they were convincing.The story has two interesting aspect to it; one is how an amazingly grounded land baron (Matt King) and his daughters deal with the news that his dying wife, their mother, was cheating on him, which was well handled story and the other is the family's roots to the native founder of the former kingdom and how Matt King handles the potential biggest land deal of the state. The title, referring to that second aspect of the movie, was quite fitting. I certainly don't consider the movie a comedy just because, as in life, there are some funny scenes; since it's not a tragedy as we commonly think of such movies, plays or novels, I'll settle for simply a good story, and hope you find it to be that as well.",The Descendants
123,Likes_Ninjas90,There were few films in 2011 that moved me as much as this one,9,6 January 2012,"The Descendants opens in Hawaii with a woman named Elizabeth (Patricia Hastie) cruising in a speed boat and then the screen fades to black. We discover that she is the wife of Matt King (George Clooney) and that during her boating race she suffered an injury that has left her in a coma. Matt is a lawyer looking to sell off the land he inherited from his ancestors because the trust is set to expire in a few years. As a father he is a failure. He doesn't know how to look after his youngest daughter Scottie (Amara Miller), whose behaviour has deteriorated in the wake of her mother's accident. Matt's other daughter is Alexandra (Shailene Woodley). She's seventeen and lives away in a boarding school. She's reckless and aggressive but Matt needs her help in looking after Scottie. When Alexandra reveals a secret of her mother's, Matt is sent into a blind rage and looks to track down a man named Brian Speer (Matthew Lillard). Compounding this is that he needs to tell his other relatives about the true fate of his wife. The imminence of death creates such a spiral in our minds that we lose sight of all that is beautiful in the world. This is the theme of Alexander Payne's adaptation of Kaui Hart Hemming's novel. Payne is a writer/director who, with films such as Election, About Schmidt (2002) and Sideways (2004), has mastered the art of small humanistic comedy- dramas. He is fascinated by how the ordinary and the banal are often the most chaotic and life changing adventures. It is easy to see why Payne was attracted to the source material. There are strong resemblances to About Schmidt, which was also about a man concerned with death and isolated from his child. Knowing the initial premise, I was concerned that the films might be too similar to each other. Payne is a gifted filmmaker but it remains perplexing that this is just the first film he has made in six or seven years. There was always the thought that he might be inclined to repeat himself. What impresses here though is the way that he has refined his craft. Hawaii is a unique, beautiful setting, sumptuously photographed by cinematographer Phedon Papmichael. Payne opts to use this aesthetic beauty to enhance the thematic concerns of his narrative. The beautiful opening shots of the green landscapes and beaches are juxtaposed with intercuts of the cityscapes, traffic jams, the sick and the homeless. We're told that this is no paradise and Matt adopts this mindset by spending much of the film tracking down his nemesis Brian. He carries a photo of him on the beach, forgetting all of the positive things around him. In the course of his absence, Payne seems to have lost a lot of his cynicism regarding character development. Growth stems from seeing a deeply troubled and angry man develop into someone who appreciate life's pleasures. Yet most impressive is that every character in this film, large or small, has a degree of real humanity. Many characters surprise us because they don't act the way we think they will or have come to expect from similar movies. When Matt finally tracks down Brian he is not the jerk that we assume he will be. He's an ordinary man on holidays with his wife (Judy Greer) and their two small children. She is a lovely addition to the film: extremely pleasant and welcoming but painfully unaware. Brian explains his mistake to Matt and reveals his commitment to his own wife. He is a weak man but we believe him anyway. Similarly, through many of these adventures Alexandra drags along her dopey surfy friend Sid (Nick Krause). He's an oaf but a mostly harmless one and he moves us unexpectedly when he reveals his own personal traumatic experience and how he deals with his problems. Payne's control over these scenes is deft and unintrusive. He has confidence in both the actors and audience, refusing to linger over the most poignant moments. His restraint builds a quiet realism and in turn we're met by a film that is regularly very moving. This sounds daunting but the film is also hysterically funny too. The humour is never cheap or obvious. The dialogue, often with a self-depreciative tone, is employed to reveal character and enrich the comedy and drama. A lot of the comments from the side characters are deliberately inappropriate, showing their lack of empathy or understanding of a situation.The effect is twofold: some scenes are very funny but others are built with powerful dramatic irony. There's a gutting moment when Elizabeth's father is telling everyone how good he thinks his daughter has been and how she deserved better, when we already know her secret. I can think of very few other films this year that have used dialogue as intelligently. Well-cast actors give the dialogue humour and feeling. Clooney's performance can be summarised as entirely glossless. It's a great part for him because he's given a range of emotions to work through, rather than a corridor of self-parody and smugness. He reveals a character who is helpless and yet desperate to control his children. He tries to be self-assuring too, telling us that his wife is going to be okay. Payne contrasts this with a high-angle shot of a spiralling staircase, foreshadowing devastating scenes of Matt's torment and verbal rage. A more controlled and empowered individual, who learns to make his own decisions, emerges convincingly. Clooney's fine work is also rounded by his impeccable and always reliable comic timing. This is a very impressive performance and one that could potentially earn him a Best Actor Oscar. Shailene is a standout as an impulsive, angst ridden teen, equally enraged and frustrated by the same woman as her father. There were few films in 2011 that moved me as much as this one. It's one of the year's best.",The Descendants
124,Christian_Dimartino,"Yet another lovely, rich masterpiece from director Alexander Payne.",10,18 March 2012,"Alexander Payne is a cinematic God. Though I can't say he's underrated, because he's won two Oscars, I can say that every film of his that I have seen was fantastic. He's a director that sticks to a certain kind of humor in each and every film; his films are hilarious character studies about real people doing things that push them over the edge.His past works have included Citizen Ruth, which I can't wait to see, Election, a comic masterpiece, About Schmidt, a rich, powerful, and lovely film, while being hilarious, and the same goes for Sideways, which he went home with an Oscar for.His other films were sort of a warm-up in preparation for his latest film, The Descendants, and that's saying a lot considering his resume. The Descendants is more serious than his other works, but yet it still stays in the Payne-ian spirit of real comedy.The film revolves around a Hawaiian land barron named Matt King (played by George Clooney), who's life is turned upside down when his wife falls into a coma. This forces him to reconnect with his daughters, Scottie and Alex(Shailene Woodley). Just as Matt is starting to understand things, he quickly loses that understand when he realizes that his wife was having an affair. So, while struggling with his vegetable of a wife, his kids, and his job, Matt and Alex soon pursue his wife's other man, which brings the family closer.The rest of the cast includes Beau Bridges as Matt's cousin; Robert Forester as Matt's grouchy father-in-law; Matthew Lillard as Brian, a real estate agent, and Judy Greer as his somewhat clueless wife. Every single cast member of The Descendants is marvelous. from Clooney, to Woodley, to Lillard, to Greer, and Nick Krause, who plays Alex's hippie friend.There are plenty of awkwardly hilarious moments here, mainly from Krause. But even with all of it's laughs, The Descendants is a powerful film. Clooney's performance is the best I have seen all year. He plays such a rich, funny, and sad man who you really can't help but root and sympathize for. Clooney is really wonderful here, and so is everyone else.The Descendants is lovely. It's extremely entertaining. A wonderful, warm, funny, and beautiful story about family and the things that bring them together. Up until today, Hugo was the years best film. But I think that,now, after seeing The Descendants, my vote has got to change. See it, otherwise you'll have a hard time believing it.A+",The Descendants

Thankfully, it balances out heavy themes and complicated emotions in uncommon detail.The characters in this movie are many, complicated, and sorrowful in their own unique ways. He keeps his composure, but we can still see a very heavy, filtered sorrow beneath the surface.

127,DonFishies,The rare fuse of amazing direction and brilliant performances,9,16 November 2011,"It has been quite some time since the Toronto International Film Festival, but I still have trouble coming up with something negative to say about The Descendants. It was a film I was immensely excited to see, and one that I think I just managed to squeak into on the second last day of the festival. I tried to not overhype myself, but with George Clooney teaming up with Alexander Payne, a filmmaker whose last film was made almost a decade ago, I could barely contain myself.Matt King (Clooney) just found out that his wife is in a coma in the hospital. Matt has always been one to put things off, and has never really found time for his kids. But in this time of need, he finds that he is struggling to identify with older daughter Alexandra (Shailene Woodley) and younger daughter Scottie (Amara Miller). When he learns of a stunning secret about his wife, it thrusts him into an adventure alongside his daughters to find out the truth, while also finding himself. From beginning to end, Payne has crafted an endearing film that is hilarious and devastating, often in the same sequence. This is a more calculated family-related effort than I originally thought it would be (with a bit too much emphasis placed on the extended family and land owning subplot), but it is the driving force of everything that happens on-screen. He never overindulges, and never gets too far ahead of himself. He lets the drama play out just as much as he does the comedy, and always keeps the film moving at a borderline ridiculous pace. This may be an indie, but it speaks more to the mainstream than Sideways ever even tried to. It is a truly spectacular work, and one that proves the worth of a talent that has been gone for far too long.While he already solidified his leading man status years ago, Clooney quite simply knocks this one out of the park. It is not the typical role we are accustomed to seeing him in, and I think that is what sells it the most. This is a very mature role for Clooney, away from the playboys, the lotharios and the screwballs. He is out of his element, much like the character he is playing, thrust into a situation he never expected in a very adult way. He plays Matt in a very nuanced way, always hovering along the fine line of being a struggling parent and having a full blown emotional breakdown. Clooney has continually proved that he is willing to reinvent himself, and his work here is no different. From the moment he steps on-screen, you are simply enamoured by his presence. We can see the brief twinkle in his eye that suggests he is still the Clooney we all know and adore, but his hardened exterior suggests he is trying to camouflage that fact. I said years ago that Up in the Air was his strongest work. But his work here makes it look positively amateur in comparison.For all of Clooney's brilliance, it is surprising to note that Woodley almost steals the movie entirely away from him. While she has had quite a lot of experience on television, this is her first real film role and is an immeasurable breakout. The trailer suggests she is a bit of a wild child, but seeing the heartbreak and pain in her face after she finds out what has happened to her mother is enough to make you want to weep uncontrollably. Lucky for her, she gets more than one scene to prove her emotional chops, and she nails each and every one. She holds her own against Clooney, and has just the right amount of charisma and angst to make her character above and beyond believable. Her struggle to find her place and to help her father on this adventure is the emotional crux of the film, and the real driving spirit. She may be extremely younger than Clooney is, but she is an old soul. Their relationship and chemistry is amazing, and should she have been acting against a less capable actor, I doubt she would be anywhere near as powerful as she is.The supporting cast, made up of Beau Bridges, Judy Greer, Nick Krause, Robert Forster and an almost unrecognizable Matthew Lilliard, are all excellent in their small roles. All of them get some really memorable moments to shine, and help to make Clooney and Woodley's performances even greater. Special mention needs to go to both Patricia Hastie, who is confined to a hospital bed for all but about thirty seconds of her screen-time as Matt's wife Elizabeth, and newcomer Miller as Scottie. She is naive and innocent throughout, never once coming off as that annoying kid you try to forget exists. She has a lot of fun in the role, and strikes a real emotional chord at just the right moments. I can only hope directors continue to use her in the future for roles that are just as good, if not better.It may have taken me practically two months to write about it, but I still find myself at a loss for words about The Descendants. It is finally rolling out into theatres now, and I cannot wait to see the film again. The cast is amazing, with Clooney coming out swinging. Payne may have taken his time finding a follow-up for Sideways, but what he has returned with is nothing short of amazing. Run, drive, fly – whatever you have to do, just make sure you do not miss it.9/10.",The Descendants

129,sashank_kini-1,The Power of Simplicity,8,3 July 2012,"Plot: Matt King is a land baron and lawyer of mixed race living in Hawaai with his entire family, which includes all his cousins who have settled themselves at different spots around the place. After a freak boating accident, Matt's wife Elizabeth goes into a coma that may be permanent. Matt has to decide when to unplug her machine, plus he also has to break this news to his family and friends. His two daughters Alexandra and Scottie are out-of-control girls who were brought up mostly by Elizabeth. This makes 'back-up' parent Matt's situation harder, with his elder daughter Alex experimenting with drugs and older boys, and younger one turning more rebellious and crass after the mishap. He also has to decide, along with his cousins, whether or not and who to sell their inherited land before it is taken up by the trust fund.Review: Descendants will disappoint those expecting a fixed resolution to every theme it tackles, but does life ever bring a complete resolution to every deed committed by man? What solely matters is reconciling with the present and realizing a harmony with people whom we care for and who still co-exist with us. Most viewers, including me at first, were waiting for a big bang in the film where the protagonist Matt King confronts his weaknesses and mistakes and faces a nervous breakdown. Most wanted King to suffer for neglecting his wife, thus making her lonely and seeking for love outside marriage. But director Alexander Payne doesn't want to make this the focal point of the story because the affair is now an affair of the past and what is necessary now is to fix the present for a better future. And Matt's present has setbacks in the form of two unruly children who face adversity in coping with the present because of their past. Matt King isn't a terrible husband and father but is rather an irresponsible one; therefore Payne wants us to cheer for him as he attempts to accept his duties as a father. And I feel audiences have this reluctance in embracing this optimism, but they must keep in mind that Elizabeth King's accident and the revelation itself are the low points in Matt's life and Payne doesn't intend to crumble his life further.The land baron, in a quest to reconcile with his children, also develops virtues such as forgiveness, empathy, righteousness, harmony, something that he had turned indifferent to because of his work and land dealings. His cousins conflict with one another on the matter of selling their sprawling land areas to developers which may reap them vast fortunes. In the beginning Matt describes himself as a stingy man whom the ultimate verdict depends upon but he seems indecisive in the whole matter. However, as begins understanding himself as a man, a father and a Hawaain citizen, his thinking becomes more resolute, much to the annoyance of his greedy and guileful cousin Hugh. Also, his confrontation with the Brian Speer doesn't end up in a messy showdown because Matt himself had realized that despite being faithful, he wasn't devoted to his wife. Plus Speer isn't the quintessential bad guy set out to ruin others' lives.Clooney again shows why he is the most popular American actor; he may not be as versatile as some of his contemporaries but he can play his characters instinctively. He does manage to stoop slightly and walk like a man in his fifties, and also speaks with more restraint and laid-backness which reminded me of an uncle of mine, but most importantly, he hits you with his spontaneous gush of emotions. Like the scene where the doctor tells him about his wife's helpless condition. Or the times where he is helpless at his daughters' peevishness. He keeps us on the story's tracks and therefore we are able to decipher the writer's/director's message rather too carried away with the actor's performance. The latter happens with stalwart Meryl Streep who can make us forget the film (and its flaws) itself with her heavenly performances. Besides Clooney, the jolly ensemble includes Shailene Woodley and Amara Miller who play two volatile, vacuous teenagers with piercing accuracy, Matthew Lillard who doesn't overdo his nervous act and also manages to make us laugh, and a whole set of people who bring humanness to the film. Two thumbs up to Beau Bridges for his canny portrayal of glib and specious cousin Hugh. And Sid is the most spaced out guy I've seen since Crispin Glover's bizarre act in River's Edge.It is difficult to define the style of the film in set terms but I think the adjectives 'temperate', 'flowing', 'bittersweet', 'joyful', 'optimistic' can be attributed. The movie progresses like those calm waves with slight ruffles that end up cooling our feet as we stand close to the shore end. It is like the moving hips of a female Hula dancer, gentle and graceful but hypnotic nevertheless. The color tone of the film itself is so cool, earthy and verdant, you can imagine staying on such an island, sitting casually and care-freely under the shades of a beach-side restaurant or bar, legs stretched out and sipping on a juicy Mai Tai as a local band plays its traditional music in the background. At such places, even if you are in a volatile state, the ambiance around you itself cools down your volatility. This is also why Payne didn't go for scenes too intense and painful. The only minor problem I had was the closing scene: King here sits with his two daughters on the couch watching March of the Penguins. I rather wanter King to camp with his daughters and neighbors Kai and Mark at the spot where they had been earlier. I remember Scottie telling her dad how it had been years since they had camped and they share their memories; it would've been a fitting ending for the movie.My Rating: 8.2/10",The Descendants
130,griffolyon12,A Hawaain Look at Life,9,9 January 2012,"Director Alexander Payne's The Descendants is a star vehicle for George Clooney. Here Clooney portrays a Hawaiin father who must deal with pulling the plug on his wife in acoma whilst trying to learn how to take care of his two daughters and learning at the same time his wife was having an affair. All just peachy. The brilliance of Clooney's performance shines in his ability to make the transitions from his character, Matt King's dealings with his wife dying and caring for his daughters to him hunting for the man his wife was seeing on the side. By handling these transitions so deftly, Clooney and Payne manage to evoke humor and pathos in these moments, just as it very often emerges in real life, and it is always believable. It can be seen in Clooney's eyes when a line or action triggers his change in emotion, such as when he follows the man home and learns that he has a wife and kids, there is a noticeable reaction due to this visual trigger. Of course, Clooney gets stellar support from the acting ensemble, in particular his potty-mouthed seventeen-year-old, played authentically by Shailene Woodley. While the resolution drags, resolving the major conflicts a touch too early, the emotions on display here are so real that Alexander Payne's deglamorization of the Hawaain lifestyle never fails to keep one watching.I give The Descendants a 9 out of 10!",The Descendants
131,RossRivero99,One of the best movies of 2011,10,13 June 2014,"Alexander Payne's The Descendants was a very good and depressing movie at the same time with George Clooney giving one of the best performances of his career as Matt King a land baron who tries his hardest to reconnect with his daughters (played by Shailene Woodley, and Amara Miller) after his wife who was cheating on him was fatally injured in a boating accident. Director Alexander Payne has done a good job directing this movie because of all the wonderful work that was done. But this movie works as a drama more than a comedy even though there is one funny scene in this film and works as a mystery because of Matt wondering the guy's name of whom his wife left him for. Throughout the course of the film we feel bad for Clooney because of what he has to go through emotionally but in the end it still was a good movie.",The Descendants
132,Laakbaar,Coming to terms,8,24 April 2012,"Despite what Matt King says, Hawaii does look like a special place. He's not only lucky enough to be living there, but he's from a large successful family (with Hawaiian blood even) that has lived there for generations and has inherited property. Matt King (played by George Clooney) is a true ""local"". The movie opens with a terrible event: his beautiful and adventurous wife (brilliantly and believably played in her comatose state by Patricia Hastie) has a boating accident. We find out that she will never recover and is close to death. The story is essentially about Matt coming to terms with this frustrating and difficult situation. The plot is focused on his telling their daughters, her parents, their friends, their family and her lover so that they can pay their last respects. The various issues that come up in this situation are explored in the movie. Of course this is a traumatising and life-changing event for Matt and everyone involved.It's a dark, difficult theme, but for most of the movie it's treated with a fairly light hand. Matt is business-like and deadpan about it all mostly, and wants to do the right thing. He seems more upset about her infidelity than anything else.We're shown Matt's world, especially his changing relationship with his daughters. How will Matt and his daughters handle the confrontation with Patricia's lover? Interwoven in this is a subplot about ""should we sell out or not?"" You see, Matt is a real estate lawyer in Hawaii....The story is about Matt coming personally to terms with his wife's impending death. By the end he has come to know his wife like he never knew her. His goodbye to her was one of the most utterly moving scenes (and most tremendous acting performances) I have ever seen on film. Bring a hankie.",The Descendants
133,Horror-yo,"Nice film, but not Payne's best",7,7 April 2017,"Don't get me wrong. It makes for a convincing viewing. But I wouldn't call it anything more than a decent, Payne-directed film.All the ingredients are there for a Payne piece, the tortured (usually male) lead character, the cast around him that mean to help but represent problems in their own right, and an absolute disaster taking place and how that lead character copes with it: an issue that often involves more than his only self.The film is pleasant to watch, the acting is very good, especially with that young Woodley actress (elder daughter) who is simply the best on screen really, absolutely nailed a difficult role that required more than just standard text-reading. The characters are interesting and believable; always that depth about the characters with Payne; and there aren't any weak parts really per se during the film, as established earlier it makes for a nearly 2hour long smooth and pleasant viewing, with the different sides of the story connecting well at the center of the plot...but it just isn't touching for one, never finds its way to the viewer's heart the way it should, the film seems more like an interesting network of influences and characters and motivations really than a heart-wrenching dramatic piece (which it obviously does seem to mean to approach).It's good, but really just good, nothing more. 7/10.",The Descendants
134,SquigglyCrunch,"Just Okay, Nothing New or Special Here",5,2 December 2015,"I went into this movie without a clue what it was about. I didn't even know it was in Hawaii. But I'd seen the ratings so I thought I'd give it a watch. Unfortunately I was really unimpressed. The Descendants has a relatively interesting plot, but I felt like everything played out poorly. Nothing felt particularly significant, even though it was a pretty small-scale movie it terms of what happened. It never felt truly important to anyone. Maybe it was just the actors, or maybe it was just the writing. I don't know. Either way, it didn't feel like anyone really gave a crap what happened. The characters were okay, just average in terms of today's standards. I assume that they were trying to develop the characters more, considering the fact that it's a movie about family, but I just didn't see any particular amount of effort put into them. The acting really wasn't that good either. I wouldn't say it was bad, but it wasn't good either, especially George Clooney. I really didn't see anything special about his acting, and it ended up feeling a little fake. There was so little emotion in his face that it really took away from the feel of it. He really seemed like he just didn't care and wasn't genuine. I haven't seen many Clooney movies, but if he's always like this then I really don't have a heck of a lot to look forward to with him. I even thought that Amara Miller did better than he did.Overall the Descendants had an interesting but poorly carried out plot. The characters were pretty average, and the acting was bland and often ingenuine. In the end I would not recommend The Descendants because even though it wasn't a bad movie, it just wasn't anything special at all.",The Descendants
135,doctorsmoothlove,Pray for no more of them...,4,11 January 2012,"Everyone in The Descendants has a communication problem. Notwithstanding the plot where this issue is centerfold, the characters themselves have an irritating lack of ability to be expressive with each other as fast as they should be. The film inches along while we wait for them to do what we know has to happen: have frank conversation with each other. From this we are to derive humor and pulled heartstrings at calculated intervals. Two child characters exist entirely to allow the narrative to float in the realm of dramedy that Hollywood habitually uses to pluck savings from the elderly (or anyone else) during the holidays. This film may very well win an Academy Award despite its lacking nonfinancial reason to exist.Fortunately Alexander Payne's movie isn't as cringe-inducing as last year's The King's Speech. As you watch it you'll identify some saccharine avenues not indulged. They permit the film's flimsy story to avoid the hero worship these kinds of films love to invoke in favor of mere tedium and frustration. It's odd choice of casting to put George Clooney in the title role of Matt King. His recent characters of The American and The Ides of March are anything but the emasculated wimp he has to play here. That's actually the biggest problem with The Descendants. Payne's movie is too detached and unnecessarily cruel to King without offering him the opportunity to challenge his status quo until it ends.King is an overworked attorney with a troublemaking older daughter Alex, a younger daughter, and bored housewife. Before the film begins, his wife is nearly killed in a boating accident, and we are informed she was with her lover during the event. What follows from this doomed scenario is a series of vignettes where King investigates the affair by talking with supporting characters who humiliate him further. In fact most of the men in this movie are undermined by personality flaws when they attempt to behave assertively. Does Payne wish to make a statement about gender roles? No, we have to deal with the unbearable lightness of being a character in this film without any introspection on his part. A better approach would have been to drop the dramatic parts and treat the absurd concept as the comedy that it should be. Alex, played with spunk by newcomer Shailene Woodley, has a Hawksian quality in her relationship with her father. She isn't afraid to challenge him or express herself completely, but loves him enough to reveal her mother's infidelity. With an alteration of the script and a riskier director, this would have made a fine buddy movie. At least Woodley was able to escape television, and she would be well suited for modern screwballs.What calls attention to the viewer is the emanating nothingness that results from the film's faulty structure. Payne begins the movie with a Clooney monologue declaring that life in Hawaii (the setting) isn't just a vacation. The story fails to satisfy this observation by the repeated glamour shots of the countryside and its annoying main character. He even puts Woodley in a bikini top frequently to keep our focus when we aren't supposed to laugh. Don't fall for the eye candy. The Descendants is a bad movie, but its slight self-awareness keeps it afloat until you change the channel.Not Recommended",The Descendants
136,braddugg,"Written with humour, this is surely wicked fun and is just good.",6,20 September 2014,"Written with humour, this is surely wicked fun and is just good.The laughs come out naturally at times, even though there is a tragic meaning to it. Infidelity and death have been blended with humour. More or less I was hooked and at times just waiting to laugh again. The title, the outlook and the trailer were serious, but it took me by surprise when I went through the first 15 minutes of it. Was not able to comprehend a few scenes in first place, like George Clooney running just to find out who that man was, he could have gone in car and found out too but even his desperation was shown well. It wasn't at all serious but it was not funny either. The movie had to balance between tears and smiles and it just did well. Written well by Kaui Hert Hemmings and directed superbly by Alexander Payne, this story brought out the psychology of a middle aged man, who is going through a crisis. It's at times tough even to empathize, as it is a weird scenario that he has been in. All the director does is puts up an effective screenplay and shows us only important scenes. George Clooney does a god job and so did others. I am happy to have seen this.My Rating is 3/5. Its good for sure, but I can't say it's a must watch.",The Descendants
137,cinematic_aficionado,"Part drama, part comedy but not plenty of either",7,29 January 2012,"The Descendants follows the modern day trials of a progeny of Hawaiian aristocracy. Matt King, portrayed by George Clooney, although has been married for several years and has two daughters, has just been forced into the reality of fatherhood.The story begins with Mrs King boating accident where she is left in a vegetative state in hospital fighting for her life whilst Matt has for the first time assumed responsibility for both the household and the daughters; naturally he has not got a clue of how to be a father as opposed to having adjusted to life as an absent/back-up father.To add insult to injury, the frustrated husband finds out that his bedridden wife was also unfaithful to him and thus causing a whirlwind of emotions, thoughts as well as some travelling since the double-bereaved husband decides to find his wife's lover and let him know of her condition.Alexander Payne does a fine job in engaging the audience into the story and one will quickly feel being part of it, although it sets off with a rather long narrative as if George Clooney were reading to us from the book. The performances are very convincing, though there is no greatness and with regards to George Clooney's performance it is hard to tell whether he credibly plays the father who just discovered parenthood and he is out of his depth, or simply Clooney himself were out of his depth with this role. Matt King's daughter (Shailene Woodley) is brilliant as the rebellious teenager turned supportive daughter and same goes to her boyfriend Sid (Nick Krause) as the oddball with plenty of allure.One thing that made this film stand out is how in the beginning the father – daughters relationship is pretty much that of strangers and in the process – in the presence of several ups and downs – they finally broke those barriers in a journey that involved anger, regret, sharing grief with others some of whom were unable to empathise. As in real life, a family tragedy can bring people closer or permanently tear them apart.The book skilfully manages to exhume humour out of a tragic situation whilst the film though conveys that spirit and having been being classified as drama & comedy is not enough of either; in spite of this there are some comic and moving scenes. The intertwine of drama and comedy was much stronger in ""About Schmidt"", but then again George Clooney is no Jack Nicholson.Overall it is a moving and appealing film on the matter of human sentiments that is kept well together by the combination of its vibrant characters.",The Descendants
138,rubenm,Impressive balancing act,7,7 March 2012,"Are we supposed to laugh or not? Are some of the scenes in The Descendants meant to be funny or dramatic? The answer is: they are both. That's the strong point about this movie: it deals with serious issues like death, adultery and raising children, but never in a heavy- handed way. The subject of the movie - a man trying to deal with his teenage daughters and a difficult business decision while his wife is dying in hospital - could give you the impression that The Descendants is a heavy movie. It is not. There are many funny moments in The Descendants, but the humour is subtle and with sharp edges.The location of the movie intensifies the contrasts: in the paradise-like landscape of Hawaii we see George Clooney's character being confronted with one set-back after the other. His wife is in coma, his daughters are rebellious and don't accept their father's authority, his family members are pressing him to sign the sale of the family land, and as if that's not enough he also learns that his wife has been cheating on him. Clooney is superb in showing subtle emotions. He's never overacting or showing off. Anyone who doubts if he's one of Hollywood's greatest actors, is proved wrong by this performance, one of his best ever. Without any effort, he pulls off the difficult balancing act of grieving husband, loving father and respected businessman who's completely in control. Just as the whole film balances nicely between different emotions: you can laugh, be touched and feel angry.",The Descendants

On the other hand, Payne's cinematography is perfect and the actors performances, especially Clooney's, are outstanding: they convey a lot of emotions and really make you care about the characters. Those two points contribute largely to improving the global impression.The Descendants is a pretty solid movie overall, but it lacks that little thing that could have made it unforgivable though. Worth a second watch to maybe sharpen your thought.",The Descendants
140,TheSquiss,"Clooney the cuckold, Clooney the dad, Clooney the double Oscar winner?",8,16 June 2012,"You'll have heard much about this already I'm sure because, firstly, it stars George Clooney, who can do no wrong on film (overlooking Combat Academy and Return of the Killer Tomatoes), and secondly, he's hotly tipped to win his second Oscar.If you're looking for Clooney the sex symbol, turn back now. What The Descendants gives us is Matt King, a Clooney character who can't run, can't relate to his daughters and is struggling to deal with his comatose wife who is not recovering from a boating accident. Throw in the issue that she was cheating on him and his life on Hawaii and the hundred's of millions of dollars of prime land he's inherited in paradise counts for nothing.As King states early on, ""Paradise? F*** paradise!"" Multi award-winning writer & director Alexander Payne, renowned for Sideways, exceeds even the excellence of About Schmidt with a thoughtful, reality-based film about relationships, forgiveness and the resourcefulness of the human spirit. As with the afore mentioned About Schmidt, he refrains from throwing obvious stereotypes at the screen and hoping they'll entertain. Instead he presents a man who, when he thinks he has a second chance, prepares to make amends only to have it snatched away. King's relationship with his daughters is not tense in the obvious sense; there's been no great clash, he just doesn't understand them. But in spite of this and the abuse they hurl at him, he remains thoughtful, understanding and forgiving. Even faced with friends who knew about his wife's impropriety, he remains, well, thoroughly decent. He's a man you'd want on your side simply because he's a good man.The Descendants is an emotional film, that is to say it's not a roller-coaster or a film that induces extremes of emotions but it does require the viewer to have a level of humanity and embrace their meandering emotions. The characters evolve, certainly, but Payne unfolds in a way that it's our understanding of them that evolves. Take the elder daughter's boyfriend, Sid. He seemed to be plonked into the film for light comedic relief that failed with me; I just wanted to punch him. Repeatedly. But as the film rolled along, his character unfurled and he proved to be as real, as flawed and as rounded as the best of the roles Payne has written.Even the man who cuckolded King, played by Mathew Lilliard in a welcome return to the big screen, is complete enough to regard without obvious judgment. In another film he'd have been presented as the callous lothario we love to hate but The Descendants isn't another film. This is Payne showing that each of us makes mistakes, each of us is flawed and each of us has some redeeming features.It's obvious to say Clooney is the star but in reality, it's an ensemble piece with the principle star being the sensitivity of the screenplay and direction. It's funny, but it's not a comedy; it's dark, but not black; it's sad, but it's not maudlin. It's an extremely good film that requires a viewing tonight and at least another on DVD on a cold Sunday afternoon on front of the fire. And no buts.Another film review from The Squiss.

No worries: THE DESCENDANTS is a little gem of an Unhappy Families movie that reminded me of 2010's THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT. And George Clooney's performance really does deserve all the nominations it has pulled in. An actor who often trades on his glamour to give pleasing but lightweight performances in the style of Cary Grant, George here achieves a resonating depth reminiscent of Jack Nicholson at his best. Matt, a man whose world has just fallen apart, has to deal with anger as well as grief; he forces himself to hold things together for the sake of his daughters.All the adults in the movie give fine but underplayed performances that allow the kids - the two girls and the know-it-all friend who tags along - to shine. These two potty-mouthed girls are losing their mother. There is some laughter along the way but the grief, when it comes, is raw and real - not the 'engineered' mawkishness at the end of WARHORSE.A score of lilting Hawaiian love-songs provides an ironical counterpoint to the tragedy, and the lush tropical beauty of the islands underscores the movie's central theme: even in Paradise people are forced to live lives of quiet desperation.",The Descendants
142,mukava991,over-hyped - but what isn't?,7,11 December 2011,"""The Descendants"" is tame compared to Alexander Payne's recent directorial efforts. Again, he is showcasing average people squirming under the pressure of socially demanding situations. This time it's the photogenic and charismatic George Clooney as a Hawaiian lawyer (and hereditary landowner) adjusting messily to the hospitalization of his wife after a boating accident. Complicating matters are his out-of-control teen and tween daughters and the revelation that his now-comatose wife had been having an affair at the time of her mishap. Clooney is another flawed 21st century Everyman, previously played in Payne's films by Jack Nicholson in ""About Schmidt"" and Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church in ""Sideways.""For every scene that pops with originality there is one that drags like a well rehearsed ""quirky"" television drama. The pace is slow. The audience frequently sighs, waiting for the next bit of forced oddness. But there are also wonderful scenes like Clooney's intricately prepared confrontation with his main nemesis (Matthew Lillard), the interactions with his oldest daughter's annoying, then endearing, boyfriend (Nick Kraus) or the perfectly conceived ending, another thing Payne is very good at.It's a generally depressing vision of Hawaii. The opening narration by Clooney, accompanied by travelogue-type panoramas of a traffic choked highway and crowded city streets populated by sullen poor folk, seems bent on dispensing with any notions that Hawaii is ""paradise,"" though much later in the film Clooney's character clearly describes it with that very word. In sum, this feels a little too much like territory already explored, but I'd still recommend it for some brilliant sequences.",The Descendants

Payne gives us a superb glimpse into the dark corners of a contemporary family when tragedy strikes unexpectedly and the people in that family must deal with situations both unexpected and personally shattering. How all concerned handle the unexpected is the core of this marvelous film. As with the media commentators I must agree that this is Clooney's best performance to date but having said that I believe all the cast are excellent.

145,estreet-eva,"Not quite ""Sideways"" but high-quality filmaking nonetheless",7,4 January 2012,"Alexander Payne's last movie, 2004's ""Sideways"", was comedic, dramatic, intelligent, fare that dealt with real-life grown-up problems in a compelling and realistic way. Much can be same of ""The Descendants"" with the replacement of more tragedy in place of comedy. Sadly, it took 7 years for Payne to return to the big screen but happily, he seems to have invested most of those in this film. Each scene has a high-quality sheen of thoughtfulness and deliberation and one assumes George Clooney and the lesser-known actors earned their money here by doing take after take. The story of a workaholic father compelled to prove himself outside of his family's somewhat randomly inherited fortune of Hawaiian cash and property who suddenly faces the need to bring his family back together after his wife's boating accident is rich and complex. The film presents a study of motivation even including those of the comatose wife in a smart and intriguing way. Payne folds the plot together point by point, much like a skilled creator of origami, so that the beautiful finished product doesn't fully manifest itself until the very end. The best picture nomination it will received is earned but it isn't quite a classic as it lacks comedic leavening to sweeten up it's dark tones of death, infidelity, failure (as a father) and pressure (to decide what to do with the half-billion dollars worth of land the family owns.) Also, the inclusion of the character of Sid, as the older daughter's boyfriend, feels a bit tacked on and we are never quite clear why he incongruously is included in all of the family's intimate moments. In short, an intelligent tear-jerker well worth seeing on the big screen which will give ""Hugo"" strong competition for the Best Picture Oscar award.",The Descendants
146,moviemanMA,Paradise Lost,10,21 December 2011,"Alexander Payne bursts back onto the big screen in his book to film adaptation of The Descendants. It stars George Clooney as Matt King, a man whose family history is sort of the history of Hawaii. When a new law is passed that forces him and his remaining family to pass on their large chunk of shoreline real estate, King is faced with a major decision. To make things worse his wife is in a coma following a boating accident. The outlook isn't good, but things get even more complicated when the bombshell of an affair she had is revealed.It's a family crisis. He and his two daughters, Alexandra (Shailene Woodley), a teenager in reform school, and Scottie (Amara Miller), a young, rambunctious girl who is quickly making more enemies than friends, need to come together to help get through this ordeal. Matt needs to get in touch with family and friends to find some answers about what to do with his land, but also sneakily uncovering more about his wife's love affair. As he digs deeper, he uncovers more about himself than about anything else.Alexander Payne is drawn to male characters struggling to find themselves. Broderick in Election, Nicholson in About Schmidt, Giamatti in Sideways, and now Clooney. They all have what appears to be a clear journey, only to find obstacle after obstacle in their way. Payne also finds himself at home in the world of adaptation. I have not read any of the books that his films are based on and I'm not so sure I would ever go after them, but Payne finds a way to present these stories about self discovery in such a unique, comic light, while keeping it grounded with a good heart.This is by far his most touching and heartwarming film to date. It's not just the writing or the source material. It's the whole shebang. Acting, photography, the setting, and one kick-ass soundtrack.Clooney leads with a strong performance, jilted betrayed husband with confused father. His face holding back the emotion as long as it can. This is by far one of Clooney's more personal performances (which is saying something. He tends to give his all in his work). He is backed up by arguably the best supporting actress of the year in Woodley. Not only does she look the part but she performs her character with a certain grace. She's a loud mouthed teenager (obvious influence on her younger sister) who isn't afraid to get involved even if it hurts. Beau Bridges and Robert Forster offer small but effective performances that add some back story to CLooney and other characters, as well as moving along the plot.The music, a collaboration of island vibes from a wide assortment of artists, helps add to the illusion we mainland people have about Hawaii. We see palm trees, flowered leis, and white, sandy beaches, when the reality is it is just like any other state in the union. They have to work, raise families, and get stuck in traffic just like everyone else. Still, there is something extraordinary about the setting. I've seen plenty of films with bizarre and unorthodox locations, but there is a strange quality to Hawaii. Perhaps it was the melodious tones of the ukulele or the crashing of the waves along the shore, but there is a sense that this place is special, therein making the characters even more interesting. How can people live normal lives in this paradise? The interesting location mirrors the characters. There are as many layers to the beauty of Hawaii as there are to Matt King's inner-workings.The Descendants is touching, sometimes dark, and one of the best films of the year. It's a culmination of perfect parts meeting fascinating characters and a beautiful state. Enjoy.",The Descendants

148,socrates99,Another miraculous cinematic experience to report,9,16 March 2012,"Just saw the DVD and am in a state of awkward gratefulness. Who's responsible for this unlikely gem? Surely we should thank the two leads, George Clooney and Shailene Woodley, and the director, Alexander Payne, who is also listed as one of the screenwriters, but clearly this movie shows tender loving care by far more than three people. Kaui Hart Hemmings wrote the book from which it is derived and has to be congratulated even though her very brief appearance in the movie as Clooney's character's secretary, 9 minutes into the movie, is way too brief.The setting of Hawaii is a moving one. The music some of the most appropriate I've ever heard in any movie, bar none. All the acting is top notch and fully committed to achieving something special. They succeed as if they had thought this was everyone's last chance to leave their mark. No wonder its been included in so many favorites lists. My wife who loves human drama was riveted to the screen throughout. And yet the whole thing is as light as angel cake.Despite the occasional swear word I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this movie to anyone old enough to be exposed to a memorable depiction of the loss of a loved one. The way Clooney's character deals with the handful his daughters are, is worth the price of admission all by itself.",The Descendants
149,sunznc,"Unique, offbeat, funny and sad at the same time",9,26 November 2011,"The Descendants is a unique, offbeat film with some pretty serious issues involving an entire family.George Clooney and his family own a large piece of beautiful land on Oahu that is in a trust that must be sold in 7 years. The family wants to sell because they would all be millionaires but George realizes if he sells, it'll be just another hotel with a golf course and parking and installed trees, bushes and grass just like everywhere else. He drives around his island and see's the same thing every day. Meanwhile, his wife is in a coma from a boating accident and he is dealing with her and their children. Everyone has issues here regarding wife and mother but how can you talk to her about it all? You can't. So everyone is punching bag for each other here. The acting is excellent by everyone! Especially George. I think this may be his best acting yet. The scenery is of course beautiful but here we see Hawaii as a backdrop to some pretty intense issues reminding everyone that for the people who live there, their life is not one big vacation.Excellent film, a bit offbeat, a bit sad and funny at the same time. Go see it.",The Descendants
150,dansview,Not Bad but Missing Something,6,21 March 2015,"George Clooney was good in this. Finally he wasn't playing a stud. In fact he was an ineffectual loser. The characters are real people with flaws and redeeming qualities. Get rid of that stupid narration. It's such a cheap device.Using a coma as a device has been done too, like in the Sandra Bullock picture While You Were Sleeping. But I'll excuse that. My primary complaint about movies is lack of character development. In this one you never see the couple together, so you can only hear second hand what their marriage was like.You do get development for the Clooney guy, his older daughter and her boyfriend. The boyfriend was the most interesting and genuine of all. He's a seemingly dumb loser yet exhibits lots of patience and wisdom at times.What was missing was some sense of why this guy was such a loser and why the marriage was so shallow. Since he comes from Hawaiian land barons and has a large family infrastructure, why doesn't he have deeper values and more fortitude? I need more background.The bikini-clad wise-cracking spoiled daughter is a cliché that I could do without. At least if you're going to use it, let it be one over 18 with some meat on their bones. If the idea was to titillate, it didn't work.It could have been worse, and there were some good photographic frames of beach settings. The cliché Hawaiian ukulele music drove me crazy. This is one boring-arse film. So only watch it for Clooney's portrayal of a loser. He is good.",The Descendants

152,markgorman,And the winner is...,9,6 February 2012,"Alexander Payne burst onto the movie scene in 1999 with the darkly humorous Election for which he garnered an Oscar nomination for the screenplay that he co-wrote. He quickly followed that up with About Schmidt in which Kathy Bates and Jack Nicholson grabbed Oscar nominations for best actor and actress, in 2004 he picked up a further 5 nominations for Sideways (including best director and best movie)and his first award (again for best writing).It's been a seven year wait for his fourth outing (in between times he's mainly done TV) and guess what, he's done it again. Another five nominations, mostly for the biggies (writing, yet again, director, movie, actor and editing). Unless you hadn't gathered from this Alexander Payne is one of the most consistent and reliable writers, directors and movie makers in Hollywood today and The Descendents is his best yet. It also confirms George Clooney as undeniably the heir to De Niro's throne as Hollywood's best current actor (De Niro long ago having cashed in with a string of junk that defames his previously unblemished career).Each of Payne's films is different but similar. All have dark story lines at their centre and deal with big issues; ageing, sex, popularity, death. Each are hilariously funny (in fact you'd call Election, About Schmidt and Sideways comedies) but The Descendents ups the ante.The Descendants is an, at times, deeply moving story about trust, love and despair. It casts Clooney as the wronged husband and father; a career lawyer who's lost touch with his wife so that she embarks on an affair that sews together a plot that touches on greed, deceit and family values.Apart from the opening ten seconds , Clooney's wife spends the entire movie in a coma thereby forcing him to make proper emotional contact with his two daughters; ten year old princess in the making (Scottie played really well by Amara Miller) and 17 year old school boarder and problem child Alexandra (an oversight by the Academy for Best Supporting Actress) played by Shailene Woodley – better known for US hit TV series; the Secret Life of the American Teenager. Woodley smokes throughout! What sets The Descendents apart and makes it a real live contender for best movie is its brilliant writing and acting and its ability to turn on a dime from humour to pathos. In this respect Clooney does indeed pull out all the stops (in as unexaggerated a style as only Clooney can do when pulling stops out) in his role which sees him on screen throughout. His despair is muted but tangible and the final scene pretty much breaks your heart.This is a very fine movie indeed and may yet surprise the bookmakers come February 26th. Here's hoping because from where I sit it was 2011's best nominated movie (Drive being ludicrously overlooked by the Academy)",The Descendants
153,HelenMary,touching drama about family tragedy and reconciliation,7,8 April 2013,"I'll say it first, George Clooney is always great and in this he is rather outstanding playing a rather tense and tragic role but with his trademark dark humour and genius. The cast were all good, especially the three child actors.Set in beautiful Hawaii it opens by saying how just because it's a paradise it doesn't mean everyone is happy, successful and stress free and the story follows the King family - Clooney - who is in the hospital with his wife in a coma following an accident. He's a successful old-money Lawyer who has become distanced from his two girls and in this family tragedy he has to rekindle the relationships with them despite all the wrinkles that he has to deal with. It's realistic, believable and emotional but without being depressing; it's quite uplifting really. It's not unpredictable, but surprises aren't what you want with this film. It's naturalistically filmed, no tricks, bells or whistles and Clooney certainly carries the film despite there being a lot of familiar faces. It's down as ""comedy"" but I wouldn't call it that really without using terms like ""dark"" or ""black"" in there too. I would term it a light drama really, the subject matter is very sad and if it is close to home it will be even more difficult to watch.Overall, this is a great film, worth the watch and worth all the hoo-har it caused in Tinseltown and all the gongs. Well deserved. Enjoyed it. Uplifting in a low-key kind of way.",The Descendants
154,nickmesafilms,The Descendants (2011) - George Clooney is Totally Going to Take the Oscar Home!,10,27 January 2012,"Based on a novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings, ""The Descendants"" is one of the most affective and heartwarming movies in recent memory. This is a realistic piece of storytelling that tells about keeping a family together, while trying to keep everything else from falling apart. George Clooney makes a terrific performance that would definitely lead him to an Oscar win. He plays Matt King, a successful real estate agent, whose wife is in the middle of a coma, after a boating accident. He tries to keep his head in the game, while trying to find the man who was apparently having an affair with his wife, and trying to take care of his two daughters, while making sure that they don't become spoiled and selfish brats. But apparently, they're spoiled and selfish brats. Shailene Woodley makes a brilliant breakthrough performance as Matt's older daughter, Alex. I thought she was a really good actress, and she did a pretty powerful performance. But I just don't understand why she got snubbed for the Best Supporting Actress category, when she was supposed to get nominated in the first place. We also get some crowd-pleasing performances like Robert Forster as Matt's cranky father-in-law, Beau Bridges as Matt's business partner 'slash' cousin, and Judy Greer as the wife of the guy that may or may not had an affair with Matt's wife. Co-written and directed brilliantly by the talented Alexander Payne, ""The Descendants"" is a heartwarming true-to-life tale of hope, love, and family. This movie perfectly captures the every-day struggles of a family in crisis. The realistic details can relate to what all families go through in real life. This movie had it's moments, and it perfectly deserves the credit. By the end, I was impressed on how this movie turned out. The script is top-notch, the casting is awesome, and the heart of this movie is potentially moving. This movie is enjoying from start to finish, and it really puts a mark on Clooney's career. ""The Descendants"" deserves it's Best Picture nomination this year, and I hope that George Clooney gets some of the credit. This is one of the more unique films of the year, and it's just your ordinary tear-jerking flick. ""The Descendants"", in my review, ""an enjoyable motion picture, with a unique potential"".",The Descendants
155,Rockwell_Cronenberg,"Clooney is Oscar-worthy, the rest isn't.",4,16 January 2012,"The Descendants is a mediocre movie anchored by one of the best performances I've seen from 2011. George Clooney commands this film from the word go, giving a stripped down performance that is him at his most weak and vulnerable. He once again removes all of the charm and charisma he is known for and displays a broken man, lost in the world and desperately trying to find something to latch onto. This is a great character and he fully dives into it, a grown man who has never had to take any kind of responsibility and is now confronted with it in many different forms.With a comatose wife, two kids completely under his care and a land deal that determines the fate of his family's fortune, Matt King has so much on his shoulders and as the film progresses you can see that start to weigh on Clooney more and more. As he's been doing the past few years, it's another expertly internal performance that is breaking just underneath the surface while trying to give the illusion of togetherness to those surrounding him.Unlike those performances in recent years though, this one really gives him the opportunity to let some emotion pour out. There are many scenes in the film that had a major impact on me, thanks to this performance. He displays a level of openness, weakness and vulnerability that we haven't seen from him before. It's an absolutely phenomenal performance and I really wish it belonged to a good film, but unfortunately that isn't the case.Despite this impressive force at it's core, the story around it is so weak and meandering. It doesn't feel like there's any focus at all here in the writing, which I ultimately blame for what limits this film from it's potential. I don't think Alexander Payne tackles the subject matter with the gravity he should, and none of the comedic moments worked for me at all, but there wasn't much he could do as a director when working with such a lost script. It almost seems as though this was made to be a character study but they tried to give it too many narrative moves and eventually got overwhelmed by everything they had going on.Whether it's the focal point of King's wife going into a coma, the incredibly underdeveloped land deal plot or the wildly unnecessary affair subplot, the film never feels like it gains it's footing at all. There's an overflow of narration poured on within the first half hour and then it disappears altogether for the rest of the film. It seems as if they decided to throw everything they could at this character just to see what he would do, but then they didn't know what to actually do with all of those things they threw at him. It bounces from point to point, but none of them stick or really resonate at all.Payne is too vanilla of a director for the very dark places this film attempts to go and despite Clooney doing everything he can, there's no way to recover from the abysmal writing. The supporting cast ends up being a mixed bag, with the smaller performances by actors like Judy Greer and Robert Forster making a sincere mark but the more prominent ones from actors like Shailene Woodley and Nick Krause coming off as weak and very artificial (although Woodley does have a few good moments).Still though, every complaint I have with the film can pretty much be followed back to the screenplay they are working off of. Clooney is focused, emotional and absorbed into this role, but everything around him doesn't have half the authenticity or gravitas that he contains. It's the best performance in a bad movie this year, and honestly might be my favorite 2011 performance I've seen so far, period.",The Descendants
156,bobbobwhite,An odd and dorky Clooney,7,25 November 2011,"George spent a lot of time as his Hawaii dad character in this film with a clueless, deer-in-the-headlights look that was funny at first, but became his standard look throughout due to his mostly absentee-father's inability to gain a clue about his family's inner workings and how to deal with them after his wife was badly injured and he had to take over as the functioning head of the family. With his injured and formerly cheating wife now almost dead, his unruly kids running amok, and his big family real estate deal not settled and very confusing, he was clearly out of his depth as a husband and a father and was totally baffled about the best way to lead his kids toward a better life and his many relatives toward their chance of a lifetime real estate deal that could make all of them fabulously wealthy. The workings of those problems were the basis of the story, with a bit of his Hawaiian heritage backstory included to round it out. Seeing George as other than his typically so-cool and suave self, and pulling it off well, showed us that he has learned to be a very good actor and can inhabit a role totally opposite his own persona and make us believe in it.The film has been touted as a possible academy award contender, and it did have some good moments, but that accolade is a stretch, IMO. Most of the players did a good job in undemanding roles, but I was especially encouraged that his almost-dead wife in a coma was not glorified with lots of phony make up and an only-sleeping look in order to appear almost normal, as is done in most films. She looked realistically terrible, as she actually would in real life. But, the story lacked serious dramatic tension and mostly meandered toward a very predictable conclusion, both in the family's new-found cohesion and in the big real estate deal, and had no surprises at all so a higher rating was not truly earned. A good picture and worth seeing, but certainly not a great one.",The Descendants

Clearly I'm in the minority on this one, with the endless accolades, critical acclaim and box office success this film has enjoyed. But nothing rang true for me and part of the problem is that I could care less about a single character. I didn't find this privileged family compelling and the structure felt episodic and designed to give each character their Oscar consideration scene. This felt like a minor work from a great talent, who made a large misstep and unconvincingly tried to blend comedy and sentiment.",The Descendants
158,webmaster-3017,HK Neo Reviews: The Descendants,9,2 February 2012,"This is a delightful film to watch. It is wonderfully paced, well directed and an excellent cast to the boot. The Descendants is not a simple film, but ones that deals with complicated emotions and how people deal with life, when it gives them the lemon plus a little more. Set in the paradise state of Hawaii, the story of George Clooney's character is nothing, but paradise. What made this such a pleasing experience is the manner in which the director just eases the audience into the movie. This is an unique and effective way to keep the audience engaged without over-stuffing them with intoxicating details or dialogue.George Clooney performs outstandingly well in most likely his career best against the usual type display as the conflicted father dealing with family issues, business, potential death of his wife as well as the shattering news of knowing his wife was having an affair. None of these are forced upon the audience, but rather Clooney uses emotions, happenings, surrounding and even a road trip to let the audience into the movie and experience the experiences with him. Shailene Woodley who plays the daughter here is an absolute delight to watch. Let's hope she continues her natural screen presence into a good career. She is certainly one to watch in the coming years ahead.All in all, The Descendants is a wonderful movie, a little tragic, a little emotional, a little bit of heart and a little bit of fun. It is a delightful yet unfortunate piece of drama that allows the actors to immerse into their roles as they slowly creeps into the minds of the audience and ultimately somehow winning their hearts along the way. The film feels like a journey and by the end of the credits, there is something refreshing about this film that makes it better than it is. Maybe it is George Clooney or maybe it is just the human condition, but whatever it is, The Descendants is a fine film to boot Neo rates it 9/10",The Descendants
159,Meven_Stoffat,"Look guys, I did get this movie...",4,2 February 2012,"...it's just, I didn't like it. Alright, I'm not sure if I'm putting it the right way. I liked lots about it, but I also disliked lots about it.Actually, I'm not sure if ""lots"" is the right word either. This is one maddening film.First off, I am more then familiar than Alex Payne. After all he did do my favourite movie of 2005, Sideways. However I absolutely hated About Schmidt. I thought it was boring tripe, but I decided to put that aside and watch it on the strength of Sideways alone. And boy, was I dead wrong.The film follows a real estate agent in Hawaii, Matt King, whose wife has ended up in a bad accident that has thrust her into a near death state. With the tragedy affecting his already broken family, he reunites with his bitchy teenage daughter, who spends the movie with some douchebag I couldn't for the life of me care about. She reveals that his wife had an affair with a rival agent of his, which leads him to seek him out to confront him face to face, and seal the deal on a piece of land he owns.First off, I liked Clooney. He was the film, and without him I would have been bored outright. He's the one thing keeping it watchable. Oh, and it was shot beautifully too.But... The film just bored me.First off, it's SO PREDICTABLE. I predicted the whole thing with the land and how Matt would decide he wanted to keep the land instead of selling it. I predicted how he'd fall for Speer's wife. I predicted that Speer had a wife and kids too. Seriously, how did you not see it coming? The characters were boring as hell. The only memorable one was Beau Bridges and he was only in the film for 6 minutes. Speer was so clichéd in terms of development.Oh, and worst of all- it was so full of clichés. You can tell how it's going to end from the opening scene, and you can essentially think to yourself ""I think this is going to happen"" and -gasp- it does! But, it is prettily shot. I guess that's all that's needed to constitute Oscar bait nowadays. This isn't a bad film but it has every right to be, and the fact that it is up against The Artist for best picture is just laughable, because The Artist really does deserve the award. Don't kid yourself. This film is really forgettable.",The Descendants
160,yris2002,Solid direction and strong acting,7,15 March 2012,"You cannot escape life, and there's no paradise, where to feel free from the hard strokes of life: that's the point of this movie, and this point comes out very clearly since from the first shots, when a voice over explains that living in Hawai is not all surfing and sunbathing, but here people suffer like in any other part of the world. The story in itself is dramatic, but always keeping director Alexander Payne's humor and irony intact. The character of Matt shows a strong human insight , Clooney's interpretation never disappoints and here quite surprisingly abandons some his undeniable charm to become a real middle-age and rather decadent father and husband, at a difficult crossroads in his life. But the greatest or at least most surprising performances are offered by the younger cast, especially by Shailene Woodley as the tormented teenager Alexandra, whose interpretation of a very difficult role proves really mature and noteworthy. On the whole, a well built and solidly directed movie, supported by a strong cast, sometimes too slow and maybe too long, but never boring.",The Descendants

Whilst the story of death and coming to terms with it is morbid, Clooney, along with on-screen daughters Shailene Woodley and Amara Miller add a concoction of feelings to curb our interest. Matt (Clooney) juggles with a tough decision regarding his wife on life support, single-handedly looking after his two daughters, all the while dealing with work and other such pressing matters. Sounds like a lot of ground to cover, but in hindsight The Descendants is quite simple to grasp thanks to a well drawn out script and compassionate personnel to show it off.

162,Chris_Pandolfi,"It's Hawaii, but It's Not Paradise",8,16 November 2011,"""The Descendants,"" adapted from the novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings, shows that people can always surprise us, no matter how well we think we know them. It tells the story Matt King (George Clooney), who may live in Hawaii but doesn't live in paradise. His wife, Elizabeth (Patricia Hastie), lies in a coma in a Honolulu hospital following a boating accident; only after finding out that she will never reawaken, only after deciding to take her off life support, does he finally learn that she had been cheating on him. He found out from, of all people, his seventeen-year-old daughter, Alexandra (Shailene Woodley), who fought with her mother after catching her with another man. Even now, as she lies in a hospital bed with her mouth agape and an air tube sticking out of her throat, Alexandra remains angry and rebellious – a boarding school party girl who's first seen as a belligerent drunk.The details of the affair are for the most part not discussed. The best we get is a close friend telling Matt that Elizabeth was unhappy in the marriage. We, of course, will never know what share of the blame she deserves. It is clear, however, that Matt has been distant from his family. If he were engaged, it wouldn't be a matter of missing the telltale signs of an affair, which are very hard to hide; it would be a matter of her not wanting to cheat on him at all. He's a lawyer by trade, and a successful one at that. Despite this, he isn't one to let himself or his family spend money recklessly. According to his opening narration, Elizabeth considered this stinginess. He considers it the best piece of advice his father gave him: Give them enough money to do something, but not so much that they do nothing.He never had to be so actively involved in the life of the younger daughter, ten-year-old Scottie (Amara Miller), who seems understandably confused by it all. He was always the backup parent, the understudy. Now that Elizabeth is dying, he has no choice. Although his primary reason for retrieving Alexandra from boarding school was to give her the chance to say goodbye to her mother, there's no escaping the fact that he also wanted help raising Scottie. He even tells her at one point that he has no idea what to do. I was torn between admiring his honesty and wondering why he got married and had children in the first place. I would not classify him as a workaholic, but he's definitely not a family man. Even during the periods where he gets along with his children, it's obvious that the connection is weak.Matt has more on his plate than the impending death of his wife. He's the trustee of his family's ancestral lands, a beautiful patch of virgin soil where Elizabeth and Alexandra used to go camping. He's under pressure to sell the land, which will be developed into a luxury resort and commercial complex. Obviously, Hawaii doesn't have enough of those already. It's a family affair, with most of those involved being his cousins. The most prominent is Hugh (Beau Bridges), with the long, windblown hair and a vocabulary partially influenced by surfer dudes. They're all the descendants of a Hawaiian princess and a missionary, who married sometime in the nineteenth century. Many of them feel entitled and would like Matt to make the sale. The select few that don't are pretty much in line with the entire population of Hawaii.Eventually, Matt learns the name of Elizabeth's lover and decides to confront him – and allow him the opportunity to say goodbye to Elizabeth. So begins a cross-island search for a realtor named Brian Speer (Matthew Lillard), who's wife, Julie (Judy Greer), could not be sweeter. Along for the trip are Scottie, Alexandra, and Alexandra's friend, Sid (Nick Krause). Sid has the appearance of an idiotic beach bum, and indeed, he possesses the uncanny ability to say the wrong thing at the wrong time. Case in point: He's punched by Elizabeth's perpetually angry father (Robert Forster), who can never address Matt or Alexandra without resorting to personal attacks. That being said, Sid understands the situation better than Matt gives him credit for.One of the strengths of ""The Descendants"" is that it doesn't have an emotional arc. It runs the gamut from solemn to hilarious to heartbreaking to inspirational, much like life itself during times of stress and uncertainty. The best scenes all take place in Elizabeth's hospital room, where various characters have one-sided conversations of surprising depth and power. What they and the rest of the film so expertly demonstrate is something so true and yet so often glossed over in the movies: People are imperfect and complex. When tragedy fractures a family, there will inevitably be a long and difficult process of healing. There is no one way to go about it, and there certainly isn't a fixed time for everything to work itself out. There's no guarantee that anything will work out at all. But if there's love somewhere within, perhaps it's possible for life to go on.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",The Descendants

I think I have some valid arguments.George Clooney tapped his inner George Clooney yet again. Not that it's bad. He's an enjoyable actor. But Oscar worthy? No. Clooney's character is now ready to be ""there"" in his family being that his wife is in a coma. Thus, he has had his arch even before the movie begins. And who was this awful person he was that made his wife cheat on him? We never know.Apparently he was, and is, very wealthy. A land deal will make him wealthier. But he's cheap. His wife cheated on him 'cause he was cheap? I dunno. Then he's angst-ridden over handling his kids. He sure seems like a good dad during the movie. What was he like before? I dunno.And who chooses to be a lawyer when he starts out wealthy? This character, which made me like him less. It's not like he was representing poor people. He was practicing boring law. And apparently ignoring his family 'cause of it. Why? I dunno.Then we have him chasing around the guy who slept with his wife. Okay, but it didn't really lead anywhere.

I am told this is a message movie. Look closely and you can see all these deep messages. Well...it does have a couple of meaningless points...but nothing you wouldn't have known when you were 10 years old. I must say, George Clooneys acting is his finest---ever. The Descendants is like Little Miss Sunshine...on Valium. The humour is so well hidden, only a well trained blood-hound would get it. I try never to use the word ""boring"" in my reviews...but this is boring...for long periods. Its been seven years since director Alexander Payne made the fine Sideways.

Seven years later, he finally returns, and with The Descendants, he returns with a bang.Like Sideways, his screenplay (co-written by Nat Faxon and Jim Rash) nails the tone right on the head. It has to balance out three tricky narratives in the film (Matt King's self-crisis, his comatose wife's affair with another man before her boating accident, and a land deal he's reported to make), and without the proper guidance it needed, along with Payne's own confidant direction, it could have faltered. Thankfully, it balances out heavy themes and complicated emotions in uncommon detail.The characters in this movie are many, complicated, and sorrowful in their own unique ways. Matt King was a perfect role for George Clooney. He keeps his composure, but we can still see a very heavy, filtered sorrow beneath the surface. Shailene Woodley's character (Woodley, by the way, gives one of the year's best performances) begins with a rebellious, even angry sadness, but we can see her develop over the course of the film, gaining a strong maturity beyond her years. Judy Greer and Robert Forster are each given a few spare scenes, and they make every second of their screen time count.It really is an emotional ride, even depressing sometimes, but I'm surprised by the occasional review I read where critics say they didn't feel the emotion to be sincere. In my opinion, the emotions of the film never hit a single false note. I don't think just anybody could have made this movie the way it is.

166,badajoz-1,So What - a movie to sleep through!,1,1 July 2014,"To an oldie like myself, part of this movie felt like a modern sequel to two James Michener adaptations in the Sixties - 'Hawaii' (about the first missionaries from US to Hawaii) and 'Diamond Head' (about the next generation who headed the annexation of Hawaii for the US) - with the family descendants of those first missionaries grappling with the sale of land bequeathed to them by the last King of Hawaii. But that plot line barely gets a look in and is perfunctory at best. Parallel to this 'letting go' is the personal issue for George Clooney and his two daughters of 'letting go' of his wife/their mother who has been brain damaged in a boating accident. Personal and Societal running along with each other to some form of redemption - geddit?? Unfortunately both parts of the story are boring, uninvolving, and almost fake in its attempts to create emotional grip. The direction is lacklustre and Payne does not seem interested in the content. The script is downbeat, tedious and plain awful. The characterisation across the board is done by numbers and would disgrace a soap. While the acting - even the phone company would not ordinarily let people phone these in! from a few minutes in, I just thought 'So what?' and this was my final thought as redemption was reached with a totally corny Clooney eulogy. Hopelessly poor.",The Descendants
167,efd-10467,A simple yet satisfying film,8,30 September 2019,"Great backdrop and the jumps from drama to comedy are really well written and edited, Clooney & Woodley bounce of each other perfectly, its simplicity is refreshing, the lack of action, violence & sex is it's star quality, simply a good story on film.",The Descendants
168,FallenEye,"Ruin In Her, Wake.",7,2 May 2017,"A very authentic film, that evokes on numerous occasions, conflicting and vacillating emotions. At one point The Descendants was sitting at a solid 5/10 for me, but then when it was all said and done, after all the goodbyes and apologies, ultimately the film hit a well deserved 7.3/10.It dealt with matters that I hadn't really seen in a motion picture before, while simultaneously running another story, of love, in such a special manner; in that, The Descendants created a dialogue between itself and the viewer.Matt was a comprehensible character, that was dealing with many conflicting emotions as best he could. Alex was a testing character, but also ultimately understandable. Sid... Oh Sid, a very vexatious character, that you end up perhaps, hating to love.Alexander Payne had a fairly excellent stab at depicting these characters that fluctuate so often, emotionally and logically. The conclusion to all the moving parts in their different directions was quite satisfactory also.The Descendants was more than decent, and descended and ascended as erratically, though understandably, as the Pacific waves surrounding Hawaii.",The Descendants
169,Bob Pr.,Very human,9,17 December 2011,"Alexander Payne, director of ""Sideways"" and ""About Schmidt,"" does an excellent job of portraying very human conditions, reactions and conflicts; ""Descendants"" is no exception. ""Matt"" (Clooney) is a lawyer and he--along with 15-20 cousins--are descendants of one of Hawaii's royalty and thus sole heirs to inherit 26,000 acres of unspoiled, beautiful Hawaiian coastal land which developers covet. It's up to Matt to decide whether to keep it in trust or to sell it and reap millions. At the same time, Matt is faced with having to suddenly begin parenting his two daughters, 17 & 10, during his wife's recent hospitalization; she remains unconscious after suffering severe brain trauma in a boating accident. She may not survive. Matt's oldest daughter (""Alex,"" Woodley) comes equipped with a boyfriend, a beginning separation from her family, and adult experimentation. Alex recently became distant from her mother after discovering her Mom was in an ongoing relation with a lover; her father was unaware of this deceit until Alex told him after her mother's injury. The unconscious, hospitalized wife-mother has a mother with Alzheimer's and an edgy father who blames Matt for not having been more generous to his daughter -- as if that would have avoided her dreadful injury. ""Descendants"" has a rich mixture of family/relational discord and dynamics leading to an outcome that very skilled marriage & family therapists could be proud to help a family achieve. Those who aren't that interested in family dynamics may wonder what this movie's hype is about, while for those of us who are, we find it a very captivating tale, well cast and well acted.Roger Ebert notes that ""Descendants"" gets classed as a ""comedy"" because it ends happily. BUT, up to that point, we have many relational conflicts--and pathos--and ultimately growth.",The Descendants
170,dpolwatte,The Descendants (2011),7,17 November 2019,"This is a beautifully executed, funny and witty movie about life in Hawaii. And how life moves on with problems and other setbacks.With a wonderful soundtrack and an unforgettable cinematography this film is a really worthwhile for a watch.George Clooney is excellent in his role.Overall - 3.5/5",The Descendants
171,herbqedi,"Turgid, Mawkish, and Riddled with Clichés",2,27 December 2011,"I cannot believe that the same people who ridicule and dismiss movies I like for being ""predictable"" praising this less-than-mediocre Hawaii-based soap opera to the skies. Is it because of the movie's philanthropic ""cause""? 50 First Dates was a far less predictable and more original Hawaii-based movie than this sorry retread.I want someone to tell me with a straight face that they didn't know after the movie's first 20 minutes how Clooney would lead the family in resolving the pristine Hawaiian land situation. Or that despite the fact that his children begin the movie as typically uncontrollable hell-raisers with no relationship with their workaholic father that by the end of our road-movie adventure, both daughters would get in line and resolve to be good girls and to help each other. What a surprise.And filling in the space between this, we learn that the older daughter became more estranged because she confronted her mother over an affair she was having. Learning this, Clooney storms in to the neighbor's house as the classic clichéd cuckolded husband demanding to know with whom his wife is having an affair. As happens only in Hollywood, his emasculated husband of a best friend, comes out and tells him the guy's name. And what a coincidence, when they are about to give up trying to find out what the guy looks like, we pass a realty sign with the guy's name and picture on it! Wow, what do you know about that? Oh yeah, did I mention that Clooney knows that Mom is not ever going to come out of the coma she got into as a result of a boating accident, but that he doesn't have the courage to muster to tell the younger daughter while he's going around breaking the news to half of Oahu? (Did anyone see Grace is gone?) So, now, of course, he is so obsessed with confronting the guy with whom his wife had the affair that he uproots troubled daughter from school and throws all his all-consuming work to the side while he takes the family off to the big island for an impromptu holiday - all the time not telling the younger daughter why he's there.I keep hearing how this is such a different part for Clooney. I don't see this character that different from his character in Up In The Air. His acting is fine, but not the drastic departure that critics are trying to make it. The actresses playing the girls are somewhat adequate but their quick transformation from self-centered and obsessive hell-raisers to sweet troupers doing what they can to support Daddy seems unrealistic and seamless. Robert Forster as the dead wife's arrogant father and Beau Bridges as one of the senior cousins are both wonderfully poignant in their small supporting roles. The young actor playing the older daughter's friend Sid who winds up being part of all these adventures is wonderfully refreshing and offbeat and might be the most interesting character in the movie. That would be a movie that would be much better than this predictably maudlin mess which would have been more suitable for Lifetime than to be a major motion picture being considered for Academy Awards.",The Descendants
172,virindra,Good film with a bad beginning.,7,4 August 2012,"First of all I must say this movie had a lot of good actors and actresses in it. George Clooney finally acted like a normal man and he did very well. So was Matthew Lillard, who we know from Scooby Doo and finally learned this way to act more mature. It made the movie very realistic. The story was original, the comedy and drama found a good mix and that made the movie less heavy than it could have been.What really bothered me was the beginning, where Cloony's character was wining about living in Hawaii and having a wife in the hospital. That living on Hawaii is not that fantastic compared to what people think who never have been in Hawaii. That's the biggest crap I have ever heard. Most people endure a loss of a family member or a member who is in a hospital for a long time. But they don't live in Hawaii. I have seen my own father down the hill many times and still I don't get used to it. I can't go to the beach when I have been at the hospital to visit him. Most of the time it's raining here, so the beginning was a bit wrong in my opinion.",The Descendants
173,paudie,Thoughtful entertaining movie about family,7,29 February 2012,"The Descendants is a movie about family and how our relationship with family members profoundly affects our lives.George Clooney plays Matt King. He is a lawyer from Hawaii whose wife is in a coma following a boating accident. He now has to deal with his two daughters, aged 10 and 17. This task had previously been left mainly to his wife.The movie is a series of scenes showing King dealing with this situation. He is a low-key kind of person and he is struggling to cope. It becomes even more complicated when he finds out that his wife was having an affair for a while before her accident and that she will not regain consciousness. There is also a subplot as Matt is in charge of a family trust about to make a multi-million dollar decision about the sale of prime local real estate.Some scenes are really effective, such as when King rants at his wife about her affair, as she lies comatose in the bed. There are some great scenes with his father-in-law, played by Robert Forster, who worshiped the ground his daughter walked on and blames Matt for the situation she is in.Matt's eldest daughter, brilliantly played by Shailene Woodley, tries to help her father as best she can after he decides to find out about the man his wife was having an affair with.For the most part, Clooney plays the part in a low-key way. There are a couple of his scenes that are played mostly for comic effect (for trailer purposes perhaps) but in general he does well in the part of the decent guy, trying to make the best of the situation he finds himself in.Director Alexander Payne does another good job in familiar territory, again examining the foibles of white middle class Americans, as he did in About Schmidt and Sideways. I enjoyed those movies also, though maybe he should try to look at different parts of society in future projects.",The Descendants

I fervently hoped that Gary Oldman would win the Best Actor Oscar for his astounding performance in ""Tinker, Taylor, Soldier, Spy"", but seeing Clooney's masterful performance in ""The Descendants"" made me root for him also. I thought, if the Oscars prove to be as predictably disappointing as they have become and Oldman did not win, I held some hope that at least Clooney's performance would get recognized. Alas, Hollywood's fetish with ""The Artist"" a high-gloss self-addressed statement of self-loving, only served to reinforce Hollywood's narcissism by dutifully ignoring far better movies and performances.""The Descendants"" is yet another wonderful check-mark in the win column for one of the best American directors working today, Alexander Payne. The lack of recognition from the Academy and other movie organizations, cannot dampen the quality and originality of this film.""The Descendants"" is the portrait of a family after a life-altering, or life-shattering, event in the lives of ALL its members, set against the backdrop of painful revelations, hard truths and inescapable conclusions. At times sad, funny, lovely, beautiful and profound, this movie is part life-lesson, part comedy, part entertainment and part love-letter to Hawaii.Great cast, wonderful cinematography, great direction and if this is any indication, hopefully Clooney and Payne will collaborate on future projects.Please watch ""The Descendants"" and do yourself a favour...support quality for a change...",The Descendants
176,maximkong,Over-rated piece of garbage,3,18 November 2012,"With this movie my review for all 10 best pic Oscar nominees 2012 are done. However, with all the hype and the inclusion of Clooney inside this film, The Descendants unfortunately turned out to be an overrated piece of garbage to me.Yes, there is enough heartwarming & thought -provoking moments, good acting and solid script early on, but all the clichéd drama throughout failed to cover up for the many serious flaws in this movie. A huge Minus Point -- Matt King is supposedly a heavyweight established real estate agent, but what he did as the sole trustee in the last quarter of the movie is entirely illogical, senseless, unprofessional and clearly driven by personal desire, without considering the consequences, that made me VERY VERY unconvinced. Also, I am rather unconvinced at his dramatic anger towards his wife when the movie has made it clear they were out of touch for so long. The daughters did not seem to be sufficiently affected by the family crisis as much as I would have expected.In fact, the only character that surprisingly caught my interest is Sid's, because the film manages to show two sides of him, albeit briefly.To top it off, as if Matt King had not done enough to maul the ending, there comes Julie, who came to the final scene. Although she arrived at the scene initially with commendable courage, why did she had to screw things up--what a 'good' role model for spouses who are getting cheated out there.Upon watching the ending, I am pretty sure the most likely path down the road is further destruction of the whole King family -- involving the rest of the cousins and the elder members. Is that a nice lesson to be heard from a movie with such a title? Might as well rebrand it as THE DESCENDANTS OF FAILURE",The Descendants
177,patryk-czekaj,Alexander Payne got my Oscar vote,8,4 June 2012,"'My friends on the mainland think just because I live in Hawaii, I live in paradise' says Matt King (George Clooney) in some of the first lines of the movie. And just as it proceeds to unravel the story about a man, who traverses through the magnificent Hawaiian grounds in order to challenge his problems and finally accept his better feelings, we gradually realize that the so-called paradise might have been long lost.Alexander Payne is a specialist in making movies about men, who embark on a journey deep into their own minds, just to clarify their own emotions and feelings, and get ahold of the issues that have been troubling them.The Descendants is yet another one of his masterpieces, definitely deserving all the rave reviews and Oscar nods (it's a pity that it didn't get more statues though).The aforementioned Matt King is a descendant of one of the first white people inhabiting Hawaii's islands. His wife Elizabeth just had a boating accident and is in a coma, without any close chances of waking up. He is also struggling with the thoughts of selling the huge amounts of acres of land that he inherited. Of course, along come some legal issues. And if this wasn't enough, he finds out that his wife was cheating on him for some time. What is there to do? Matt has to find an ultimate solution to all of his ensuing problems, the one that will solve all of them with just one sufficient answer.The road towards that goal is long and winding. He has to take care of his two daughters, who actually don't seem to be too fond of him and have a few issues of their own. He has to deal with the remaining members of the family (namely the irritating cousins), who, possessed by greed, are ready to sell the land right this minute. He has the great pleasure of meeting the man, with whom Elizabeth was having an affair, and his ostentatious wife Julia.Matt has to go through many difficulties and sacrifices in order to find a way to a possible happy ending. It's there, I might tell you, but everything in-between isn't in any way connected to the notion of a light-hearted tale. Quite the contrary. And Alexander Payne definitely got the right man to do the job. George Clooney is able to create a character of flesh and bones, the one that the viewer may find the most convincing. In his performance he shows that all of Matt's problems are really his problems too, and he can relate to them in such a way, that makes this role one of the best in his entire career.I should also mention that Shailene Woodley is brilliant as Alexandra, Matt's older daughter, who has a bit of a drinking problem and a slow-witted boyfriend on her hands. In the process, she transforms from a child into a woman, being clearly the intelligent girl that she deserves to be. She provides the needed support when her father is near a breakdown. The Descendants is definitely one of the most interesting movies of 2011, because with its moving tale it's able to absorb the viewer's attention and make him think and reminisce about his own life experiences. Matt King has finally found an answer to what's been ailing him, and through his bizarre, yet sad, adventures everyone can learn.",The Descendants
178,seaview1,A Life in Retrospect in The DESCENDENTS,9,24 February 2012,"Alexander Payne has written and directed films (Sideways, About Schmidt) about men at unique crossroads in life and coming to grim, sobering realizations that cause a reevaluation of the past and an uncertain future. In The Descendents, he focuses on a man's family dealing with grief and the hidden truths that threaten to tear it apart. George Clooney is outstanding as a naïve husband and father who must confront life after a terrible series of events.A water skiing accident in Hawaii has left a woman in a coma and her husband/lawyer, Matt (George Clooney), grief stricken and stunned by the news that she was having an affair with another man. It seems that everyone knew about the affair but Matt who was too busy with his work to even notice, and he must come to terms with it and rebuild his family. Matt's daughters are a troubled ten year old Scottie (Amara Miller) and his older teen, Alexandra (Shailene Woodley) who has a spacy boyfriend, Sid. As the family realizes that their mom may never recover, they must make some major decisions, and Matt must find the truth even if it means confronting the man who stole her heart. Meanwhile, Matt, as the primary trustee for the extended family, has an impending major land sale he must decide upon that could be a financial windfall for his relatives. Determined to meet his wife's lover, Matt does some detective work and, with some help from his daughters, finally arranges to meet the object of his obsession which causes him to reassess his own life and his relationship with his daughters.This is Clooney's film all the way, and he gives a thoroughly convincing portrait of a man betrayed and oblivious to his wife and his family. He is not the handsome, dashing Clooney of Oceans 11 or Ides of March but rather an unglamorous fellow who is vulnerable. The pain and realization he emotes is heartfelt. Woodley lends excellent support as the knowing daughter who helps her father's quest.Through much of the story you wonder if Matt will exact some kind of revenge on the creep or do something impulsive. That bit of tension only adds to an engaging plot. In the end, Matt does the right things and brings closure for his family. The final shot is great as Matt tries to become a dad again to his girls. A major subplot involving the land deal gets even more complicated as surprising information is revealed when Matt investigates his wife's lover. There are occasional moments of hilarity as when Matt is at the end of his rope and resorts to asking Sid for advice. It is a riot of a moment.There are good details which add to our understanding of Matt's family including his cranky father-in-law (Robert Forster) and a mother-in-law who has Alzheimer's disease. What is special about a film like this is that each major character evolves through events and changed to a degree by the end (including spacy Sid). That marks good character development. These are not cardboard caricature but fully etched individuals with weaknesses like anyone, and our initial impressions about each are dispelled by film's end.The Hawaiian scenery is gorgeous but never used as a travelogue. It merely sets the scene as did the wineries in Sideways and in some ways, the tropical paradise serves as counterpoint to the despair and angst that Matt must endure.You could imagine a Broadway version of this story since it relies more on characters and situation. The film makes you care for and sustain interest in the main characters (brought to life by a strong cast) and what happens to them. In the end, there is sadness and regret but also hope, the kind of hope that strengthens and bonds a family.",The Descendants
179,achyutaghosh,Clooney's best till date,7,26 January 2012,"The Descendants-Its hard to categorize The Descendants into a particular film genre- drama with tragic undercurrents yet tinged with dollops of comedy resulting in a bittersweet feature which appeals to one and all. There is a strong Oscar buzz around this one, and you would think the star of The Descendants is George Clooney. I believe there are two more in addition- Hawaii itself, and Shailene Woodley.Clooney plays Matt King, a workaholic lawyer having lost all linkages with his family life, and hailing from Hawaii's first white landowning family is suddenly faced with deep personal challenges- his carefree wife meeting with an accident and ending up in a coma which turns out to be a permanent one, and him having to decide on a sale of virgin forest land that belongs to his family. Things take a turn for the worse when he finds out that his wife was committing adultery, and when he starts having second thoughts on the land sale. His world completely falls apart when he has to re-establish a connect with his rebellious daughters. And there is this vast supporting cast of friends and relatives of this family, each united in their stand to sell their land for their selfish gains. The remainder of the movie deals with how this family copes with their issues, comes together to take important decisions, find their peace and at the same time, learn to move on in life, and let go of certain things for the better.Essentially, all the characters in the movie are extremely normal people with lots of problems and no solutions in sight- superficially fine but actually lost. The eldest daughter, played marvelously by the beautiful Shailene Woodley, shows all the characters of an angst ridden teen experimenting with drugs, alcohol and promiscuity, and harbouring a deep antipathy towards her mother for knowing her secret. Clooney, for once gets to play his age – he is not slick and charismatic, but scruffy, dishevelled most of the time. He displays a range of emotions- he is at once lost, embittered, funny, confused yet has to stand tall to take care of his rapidly disintegrating world, gain the respect of his family and make tough decisions. He is there in every frame of the movie, and is a solid Oscar contender for his role in this.The film is completely shot in Hawaii, a photographer's paradise, full of beautiful scenic islands kissed by oceans in different hues of blue and green makes the movie fulfil a dual role- that of a travelogue too! The lovely Hawaiian soundtrack makes the movie feel all the more poetic. Having said that, considering the word of mouth and the surrounding hoopla, i was expecting more- i was expecting more dramatic punch, more feel from the movie like Warriors had, but at the end it felt like a family sitcom in an exotic locale.This isn't a popcorn movie, and nor is it something that will make you begin to question the essence of life. Nevertheless, it is a touching movie with tear jerking moments, and smile inducing ones too. The Descendants does a great job of creating a cohesive story that has themes of family bonding and making important decisions, central to it. Releasing this weekend in India- 10/10 for Clooney fans and i trust there are a lot, and a solid 7/10 for others.",The Descendants

This role is reminiscent of his role in ""One Fine Day"" with Michelle Pfeiffer, but offers a little less wit and a little more maturity.Shailene Woodley and Amara Miller are excellent as the two daughters, with Shailene demonstrating a savvy wisdom in her delivery of lines most adults would find difficult.Robert Forster plays the wife's father, and he gives us an insight that most people would find rare, the father who trusts his son-in-law and cares for his wife at home in her battle with Alzheimer disease.All of the characters in this film are dealing with dramatic changes in their lives, and their interactions and decisions are really what we empathize with.This kind of film has to connect with the audience, and this one does an excellent job.Special hats off to Matthew Lillard, a young star of the past whose appearances have been fewer and fewer of late, and to Beau Bridges, who as Cousin Hugh reminds us that we all have a Cousin Hugh in the family.Rated R for language and sexual references, I think most families will agree this is a film for the teens, especially for families who have had to deal with loss.

When he finds out that his not-so-beloved wife had a lover, for reasons that are never made clear, he wants to meet the guy, and his teenage daughter gets involved in this also. Human foibles, tugs on the heart strings, cheating spouses, smart-mouthed, precocious kids, an extended family, Hawaii . . .

Of course with time I realized that my expectations were set so high by its 2 wins at last week's Golden Globes that I was expecting a perfect 10. I have never seen nor rated a movie personally a perfect 10 and I am still clueless as to why expected a perfect 10. This is what I did next. I shut the movie off and went to bed and sat down to watch it first thing in the morning with a fresh mind and without any expectations as all.The star Clooney is not a star today. This is the most vulnerable I have seen him and also it's the first time I am seeing him out of a suit. I have seen Clooney run in THE American and I am watching him run in THE DESCENDANTS and that's when it's struck he actually acted a run! Had this been played by someone else, I am not certain if the award for best actor would have been bagged in this motion picture. After all who ever starred instead of George Clooney would go head on with the Driver aka Ryan Gosling for the award!Moving on, this vulnerable Honolulu attorney aka Matt King ( George Clooney) who has been neglecting his wife over the past 6 months sits by her death bed as she spends her time fitted onto a life preserving contraption and in a coma following a motor boat accident. Matt who has 2 daughters; Scottie ( Amara Miller) aged 10 and Alex ( Shailene Woodley) aged 17 has no idea as to how to function as a parent since Elizabeth ( Patricia Hastle) his wife took on the burden of raising the children almost on her own. Matt admits in a narrative that he is the backup parent, the understudy. Alexander Payne directs THE DESCENDANTS with a deep understanding of the idea of disturbance. When Matt's wife gets into a coma he doesn't allow Matt to just focus on one aspect, instead he makes Scottie the naughtiest possible 10 year old to father and he brings the 17 year old Alex as an abuser of drugs, alcohol and boys. How can one man handle all this at the same time and not breakdown in despair? When Matt falls down on his knees on his own driveway and lifts his head back up at the camera is when for the first time I was certain that Clooney indeed deserved to be awarded best actor at the globes.If you think that this is all that comes along Matt's way, it most certainly isn't. Matt King is a descendant of royal Hawaiian blood. His great great grandmother was a Hawaiian princess who married a banker and along with that passed on an inheritance of 25,000 acres of land on Kauai Island. Matt as the primary beneficiary has to make a choice if he is to preserve this great inheritance or sell it to a greedy bunch of developers breathing down his back in order to build the next resort in Hawaii. To add the final pinch of salt to this already well brewed soup of events is the final surprise that his daughter Alex breaks out to him.THE DESCENDANTS is a movie that will play along close to your heart and make you feel for the King family during the time of turmoil as they fight the world and the hardships of losing a loved one. Many would call this a must watch, instead I would prefer to call this a sad to be missed motion picture.Title: THE DESCENDANTS Directed by: Alexander Payne Starring: George Clooney, Shailene Woodley, Amara Miller, Nick Krause and Patricia Hastle.

184,Jonathon_Natsis,Clooney and co. bring the quality.,8,25 January 2012,"If actors were pieces of meat, George Clooney would be some sort of pricey premium cut. If actors were drinks, he would be the kind of finely aged scotch you've seen mature so perfectly it almost seems a crime to open it. If actors wer- the point is, the man seems to have developed a talent for picking his spots every Oscar season, often appearing in highly emotional, purpose-driven fare personally customised to earn him at least a nomination for Best Actor. This year is no different, as Clooney appears in not one, but two critically appraised films, and it is his efforts, along with an excellent supporting cast and magnetic script, that put The Descendants in prime position to take out the year's top prize. The title refers to Matt King (Clooney) and his daughters Alex (Shailene Woodley) and Scottie (Amara Miller). The extended King family are the descendants of affluent Hawaiians, and so continue to own their ancestor's many miles of untouched, pristine land. With Matt being promoted to primary stakeholder, he now holds the majority vote in the decision to sell this land. Important, yes, but this pales in comparison to the other big deal in Matt's life: a pair of unruly daughters, a wife whom he discovers has been cheating on him, and a boating accident that has placed said wife in an indefinite coma.With each passing year, it becomes more difficult to distinguish between good, honest films released over the holiday period, and those simply pining for an award or two. Certainly, this film has many typical elements of an Oscar-baiter: an intimate setting, an emphasis on interpersonal relationships and a protagonist at a crossroads in life. Very little of the synopsis is truly original, but the film draws its appeal from just how the story is told. On top of delivering a powerhouse performance, Clooney is present in virtually every scene which, coupled with the sporadic use of voice-over narration, gives the audience an intricate insight into the mentally-crippling decisions one man is forced to make in an attempt to keep his family together.The film starts off simply enough, but becomes more emotionally complex with each scene. The audience is introduced to Matt, we learn of his wife, we learn of the wife's indiscretions, whom she had an affair with and why this man is of more significance to the story than first thought. For almost two hours, The Descendants progressively builds to a climax that is altogether well rounded, conclusive and memorable, like some sort of grand operatic piece. Or Stairway to Heaven, whatever. Of course, this couldn't be a Best Picture nominee without some underlying themes to accompany the plot. The film deals a lot with life decisions. That is, which one is the right one, and how the most obvious or most favoured option may not always be best. But, in some sort of strange, complimentary fashion, the most surprising aspect of this movie is how plain funny it is. To be clear, The Descendants has no intention of being classified as a comedy, but its unique infusion of 'grown-up' storytelling and often very politically incorrect humour adds depth in the pure entertainment department, particularly for those who may be deterred into thinking this film is just another sob story.If an ambition to be bold is the film's main event, then its efforts to avoid predictability as the plot thickens is its equally strong undercard. As Matt and family take a trip out to the islands so he can show his kids exactly how much of the land is theirs, one daughter recalls how she used to camp out on one particular stretch of beach with her mother when she was younger. This sounds like a certain case of foreshadowing, but Matt knows that, given the events unfolding around them, one camping trip will not solve much. This is but one example of the maturity and monk-like dedication to persistently engaging the audience, making The Descendants a must-see anytime before Oscar night.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

185,ThreeGuysOneMovie,not the blue Hawaii I was expecting,9,26 May 2012,"This film is blue, but not the blue Hawaii I was expecting to see and yet was beautiful just the same. Instead of focusing on the majesty of the lush tropical scenery the film focuses on the absurdity of mans existence and the self absorbed lost way people go through life. I was also a big fan of the historical subtext running thorough the film. It made me want to go back to Hawaii.Yeah this certainly isn't the beautiful tropical Hawaii sort of film you would expect going in. I also had not seen Clooney play someone so adrift and troubled previously. I enjoyed the way the director made the Islands feel so melancholy as a physical manifestation of Matt King's depression and soul searching.check out our full review at 3guys1movie.com",The Descendants

187,paul_3-960-896774,Nicely done but didn't really hit home for me,7,10 March 2015,"I watched the Oscars and other award shows so when The Descendants got all these accolades it peaked my interest but I never got around to watch the film. I now have, and let me tell you I was not particularly impressed, I didn't connect with the movie. But watching it I understood that people would easily connect with The Descendants. I mean, if you've been through or going through something similar this movie could really move you, and touch you like Still Alice did for me this year.So while part of me does not really understand why George Clooney scored an Oscar nomination for this - I'd have to check out who the other contenders were but I don't care that much - I have to admit that it is a decent film. It's simple, doesn't take itself too seriously, and a bit raw. The characters are easy to relate, in some way, they're kind of stripped down and feel like regular people going through some though times. Like I said, I couldn't really relate to the film because so far I've been lucky enough not to have lost anyone close to me. I know, I'm lucky I am and I do feel like I'll experience this movie very differently when I eventually go power through a big loss. Don't get me wrong, I'm not waiting for a tragedy to watch this movie again. All I'm saying is that The Descendants as everything to faithfully depict the aftermath of a tragedy, the frustration, the emotions, the humor, and the relief.",The Descendants
188,JankiSharma,"father, dear father",8,9 December 2011,The movie Descendents is interesting. Good screenplay and excellent acting.The story revolves around a cheating spouse who is not in a position to be punished by the faithful half. The whole movie is shot in Hawaii. Some of the beautiful scenes felt like a travel documentary. George Clooney and Shailene Woodley as father and daughter Alex are terrific. Nick Krause as Sid the cool friend of Alex is very pleasant and behaves like a typical teenager. Family dynamics are well done. Just needed 10-15 minute travel documentary editing. Movie is Oscar nominations worthy for best actor and best supporting actress. Alexander Payne did a great job with Sideways and now with Descendants.,The Descendants
189,SivakumarBalachandran,A Solid Emotional Drama,7,6 February 2014,"""The descendants"" is not a movie that can be easily defined. It is a beautifully chiselled gem with a sharp and moving story. The movie begins with the lead role Mr. Matt looking after his 2 daughters and an ailing wife who is hospitalised and in comma after a worst accident. Things go worse after he comes to know about the dark secret about his wife. Then the story picks up with very smooth, slow, emotional twists and turns till the climax as a drama kind of movie. George Clooney gives the performance of his career bagging the whole story on his shoulder as the respectable Mr. Matt King. He has done 100% justice to the role. If you are a great English emotional drama fan this movie is for you. -Reviewed by Sivakumar Balachandran",The Descendants
190,eschetic-2,"Quiet, realistic (mostly), involving, but utterly un-special",6,3 February 2012,"After you get past the beautifully colorful opening credits and the intentionally unpleasant street scenes of urban Hawaii, unnecessarily underlining George Clooney's opening monologue assertion that he is NOT living in a ""paradise,"" this quiet, aggressively LITTLE film slowly draws one in as it tries to create a believable look at an essentially good man trying to hold his life and family together while coming to grips with the fact that not only is the wife he loves but has grown apart from in a coma (from a boating accident) and unlikely to recover, but his discovery that she apparently had been having an affair in the months leading up to the accident.The film's great achievement is that it avoids obvious soap opera temptations as firmly as it avoids either laughs or tear jerking opportunities. Its tragedy is that it ALSO avoids any revelations for anyone who has ever lost a loved one or is over the emotional age of a Justin Bieber fan. Golden Globe winner George Clooney, the apparent front runner for this year's Oscar as Best Actor raises underacting and subdued reactions with an occasional stifled slow burn thrown in for variety to a near art form but audiences in the mood for emotional depth will find themselves in the shallow end of the thespianic pool.The best thing in the film (other than its very thin slice of upper-upper-middle class life - a side issue of poor relations who might benefit from a proposed sale of open space land which socially conscious relatives rightly want to preserve is essentially ignored - and the ingratiating persona of Clooney) is the charming underscoring of mood setting Hawaiian music. One might wish that at least some of the lyrics were sung in English for the emotional support they might have given the script - presuming the lyrics DID.There are some irritants ongoing though the film - the clueless ""boyfriend"" Clooney's eldest daughter has with her for emotional support and Clooney's unsupportive father-in-law (with problems of his own) chief among them - that the director seems to think add to the film's credibility, but over all the film IS true and fair to its characters. Had someone other than Clooney chosen to make this property their vehicle, it might have been a wildly comic tragedy, and actually more entertaining, but it wouldn't have the intellectual integrity Clooney's presence brings it. Its just a pity that the end result is so terribly minor and ultimately forgettable.",The Descendants
191,dharmendrasingh,Trouble in Paradise,8,5 February 2012,"It was always going to be difficult for Alexander Payne to equal 'Sideways', his splendid 2004 film about finding oneself through a wine-tasting road trip. Its perfect balance of ingredients – humour, pathos, neuroses - made it taste just right. With 'The Descendants', Payne proves he has lost none of his wit. It's a warm, bittersweet, intelligent drama-comedy, which I think should receive at least some of the five Oscars it's up for. All of this is pretty remarkable considering the plot revolves around a living corpse. Clooney's character complains that life in Hawaii is not as paradisiacal as we all think. He has this depressing attitude because a boating accident leaves his wife in a coma, leaving him to look after his two rebellious daughters. This wouldn't be so tragic if it wasn't for the fact that he has never quite taken to fatherhood. His time is spent managing his law practice and acting as lynchpin for his wider family. He's the head trustee of the land that has been handed down to him through several generations. With his family's consent, he plans to sell it all off to make way for corporations to run roughshod over it. But it all means megabucks for the family, so why the hell not? What we have, then, is a series of a quotidian man's quandaries which are all smartly resolved at the conclusion. The supporting cast, comprising new and familiar faces, all do something to create a community ambiance. Beau Bridges' unintentional parody of his brother's immortal Dude is funny, as is Robert Forster's turn as Clooney's mildly cantankerous father-in-law. The pathos is brought out with a harmonious Hawaiian score, which is still in my head as I write this. If you like laughing and appreciate an intelligent but uncomplicated story, I recommend this film to you.www.moseleyb13.com",The Descendants
192,JimmyCollins,Excellent. Mr Clooney is exceptional.,7,25 January 2012,"I'm not one of these people who is hopelessly in love with George Clooney, but after this film I finally see what people see in him, he has this ease on screen, his performances are so effortless that he just eases through each scene so flawlessly that it's hard not to be taken in by his charm and charisma. Anyway, The Descendants is a terrific film with wonderful performances, a great family drama storyline and a setting that will inspire your next holiday, the family dynamic between Mr Clooney and his two young daughters is unlike any I've ever seen in screen before, he seems like a dad who is close but far away from his daughters, some scenes are awkward and then others are really touching, and for someone like clooney who has a reputation for being an eternal bachelor, playing a father and having great chemistry with two young actresses is fantastic.The lush landscapes of of Hawaii are a dream for some people and the for others it's just home, and the way this is told through the story was something I really enjoyed. A lot should be said about the young Shailene Woodley, a wonderful new actress to emerge in the film industry, I have seen her in Secret Life of the American Teen and she is impressive in that too but she is a standout in The Descendants, she us just as much part of this movie as Clooney and for a young actress to hold her own next to a distinguished actor is great, I look forward to seeing her in lots more.This movie really just has it all, it's funny, it's heartwarming, heart wrenching, it's just an all round pleasure to watch. Clooney for the Oscar I say. :)",The Descendants
193,julian-mumford,Not showy but a great watch for a more mature audience,8,30 July 2012,"George Clooney has carved out a reputation for making interesting thoughtful films, clearly not interested in taking the easy superficial glamour route, he could so easily follow.In Director Alexander Paynes film, he is again all but shorn of his movie star persona and usual acting traits. Playing another everyman, this time in Hawaii, a glamorous location that Payne still manages to portray as almost anywhere. The same stresses, family troubles and tragedy, albeit with palm trees and better music.As the voice over intones, ""My friends on the mainland think just because I live in Hawaii, I live in paradise. Like a permanent vacation. We're all just out here sipping Mai Tais, shaking our hips, and catching waves. Are they insane?"" Lawyer Matt King (Clooney), is a loving albeit somewhat absent father to his two daughters and inattentive husband to sports loving Elizabeth (Hastie). He is a fundamentally good man, working hard to provide for his family but appears emotionally disconnected from them all.He also has money worries, not like most folk though. He is the sole trustee to a plot of land left to the family from descendants stretching back to 1860. A deal is in the offing, that will net some $500 million to be shared by him and his many extended family members. Understandably they are keen to sell, even if many locals are against the development deal.The catalyst for the journey we witness is a near fatal boating accident, leaving Elizabeth all but brain dead. Not a spoiler, as it's the first point of business in the film.The film is about the journey that Matt and his family take to reach some form of weak reconciliation or method of learning to trust and love each other again.Clooney is as good as he has ever been, confused, angry and clearly as a father, out of his depth. His enforced solo fatherhood role is not helped by his daughters. Scottie (Miller), the youngest is already trouble with potential for more, trouble that is. Alexandra (Woodley) has set the template Scottie is sure to follow, sullen, rude and not willing to play the game at all.The children are both excellent, notably Woodley who manages to just about pull off the feat of being obnoxious, yet likable at the same time. Her friend Sid (Krause) acting as a social hand grenade, saying inappropriate stuff but with the best of intentions.Not a lot happens but actually a lot happens courtesy of a smart script based on Kaui Hart Hemmings debut novel. Character arcs are followed, Alexandra's perhaps too fast but that is a small complaint. Clooney is believable and produces another worthy performance to add to his repertoire.It's also good to see Beau Bridges again, albeit in a small role.Summary A character study with inherent humour, drama and a strong central performance from Clooney.Not showy but a great watch for a more mature audience, a demographic largely ignored at the box office.Recommended http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/",The Descendants
194,jonnyfendi,That Little Step of Clooney Will Be One of Most Iconic Moments of His Career As an Actor,8,29 February 2012,"First of all, I have to warn you that thiz movie is not for everyone. I imagine if you are forty-something people or someone who recently has a relaxing mood, thiz movie could be a surprising one. Me myself, incidentally was in the second category. I went to watch thiz movie with nothing to expect. But you know what? Thiz movie happens to slap me on my face. Big time! Wow The Actor performances, the landscape, the instrumental music are undoubtedly splendid. The narrative is unusual but gripping. Set in Hawaii, Matt King (George Clooney) a lawyer and land baron grieves his wife, who lies in a coma. Now, King has to reunite his dysfunctional family back together again in thiz difficult situation. His alienated relationship with the two daughters is about to change. Not to mention, He discovers that his wife was having an affair with someone at the time of her accident. At a glimpse, Thiz is difficult story to tell, but simultaneously it has been well executed. The Director is Alexander Payne, the man behind ""About Schmidt (2002) and ""Sideways"" (2004). The teen daughter is played by Shailene Woodley and the younger daughter is played by Amara Miller. Both can bring their characters proportionally. These two characters are central to the story. The success of building the atmosphere depends on these two performers. The supporting Cast members like Nick Krause, Matthew Lilliard, Beau Bridges and others are also in fine condition. Nevertheless, the man who raises thiz drama to another higher level, no other than George Clooney himself! One more time, he can carry his one-man-show brilliantly. Look at his expression and body language in the middle of several awkward situations. How he has to approach his trouble daughter. How he has to react when he finds out his wife's affair. How he has to confront the man who has an affair with his wife. It's so interesting to watch his reaction to deal with the difficult circumstances. The most unforgettable scene would be when he has just discovered his wife affair from his daughter. King spontaneously runs to his relative's house to ask more about the affair. The run is long and by feet, that little step of Clooney will be one of most iconic moments of his career as an Actor. His facial expression is definitely unforgettable.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",The Descendants

I can easily see how this deserves every nomination it gets because it's an outstanding picture. For anyone and everyone who has been touched by love, betrayal, loss – and the subtle humor that is everywhere, in every situation - this is a movie not to be missed.

Basically, it's a 2 hour soap opera, and I've even seen better soap opera. The writing is dull, witless, and totally pedantic. The direction is formulaic at best and totally unimaginative. I've seen better TV shows. But the prize goes to the actors...some of the worst acting I've seen in years in a feature (but then I don't watch many new films).

On another note, Clooney is an actor who's featured a variety of lost opportunities, but here with this performance, the audience is left with nth but awe and respect. As for the music, I did not much care for it as it did not appeal to my taste, neither did I give a damn about ancestors and heritage, and I think reading the book version would bore me out of my mind.

So refreshing to spend time with this immediately recognizable man. I couldn't help but loving him. If it's true that Clooney dominates the film, he is surrounded by compelling characters.

But things aren't paradise for the characters in this movie, far from it.Clooney gives a competent and nuanced performance, with the highest marks going to the role of his eldest daughter, which was superbly realized.This film reminded me more of the films of the past, which didn't rely so much on sex and bombast, although this film definitely qualifies as a melodrama, after all, at it's core is death and dying. But I think it was the direction's personal vision not to play the typical Hollywood movie card, but instead let the entire drama play out naturally and easily, without undue drama or the typical film stereotypes employed to titillate more than anything else. It's an adult film, with adult topics, and probably of little interest to kids or teens. All in all, however, a very thoughtful and well played film, worth watching.",The Descendants

202,japamo,"Mixed Motives Permeate Decisions Made in ""The Descendants""",8,27 December 2011,"Nothing new appears in the plot department in ""The Descendants"". For the umpteenth time, we have a successful, workaholic father (George Clooney as Matt King) juggling three problems: 1) attempting to be more ""parental"" with older, estranged, profane daughter Alex (Shailene Woodley) and uninhibited younger daughter Scottie (Amara Miller), 2)monitoring the comatose, near-death state of his adventurous wife Elizabeth (Patricia Hastie), and 3) as trustee pondering how to dispose of prime Hawaii seafront real estate: sell it and make many family beneficiaries obscenely rich or preserve its pristine beauty. As you can see, Matt's plate is overflowing. The movie is about how Matt methodically and gradually addresses his three problems. To some degree, ""The Descendants"" is ultimately predictable. However, what is novel is the theme that we almost never act from purely noble, altruistic motives. In the decisions Matt makes, he simultaneously shows concern and exasperation, control and vengeance, reconciliation and resentment.For example, as he tries to reestablish a connection with Alex, Matt is fumblingly, hilariously, and sadly ineffective. That is, until he learns that his wife was having a clandestine affair. Matt, of course, is fiercely determined to ferret out the slime who cuckolded him. Perked up by the prospect of this juicy, scandalous mystery, Alex slowly drops her ""sullen teen"" facade and eagerly helps her dad discover that a Brian Speer (Matthew Lillard), a real-estate broker, is responsible. They grudgingly get closerAs another example, Matt finally confronts Brian at his rented seaside cottage about the affair. But instead of getting into a spirited fistfight that would shatter the lawyer's reputation, Matt quietly but determinedly interrogates Brian about his tryst with Elizabeth and informs him about Elizabeth's tragic state. Again, Matt's logical way of handling this seems more humane, but it is also more searingly effective in wounding and humbling Brian, and eventually his wife Julie (Judy Greer), to whom he confesses. It also exposes Brian for the cowardly louse he is, since he refuses to visit Elizabeth on her sick/death bed and sends his wife instead.Matt displays his ulterior motives regarding the land sale. With his family members, he views the breathtaking property and realizes it would be commercially vile to condemn it to condo development. Therefore, he gathers the cousin beneficiaries together to tell them that he will not sign the land over to developers. But his new-found environmentalism is not the only reason for Matt's decision. He also doesn't want the idle cousins, who never cared for the land in any way and only acquired it through descent, to profit. But Brian, coincidentally, was orchestrating the deal, and Matt REALLY doesn't want HIM to profit.As the final example, Matt discontinues life support for his wife when the doctors tell him that her head trauma from a boating accident will eventually doomed her. Of course, this is an obvious act of charity and a concession to her ""Do Not Resuscitate"" issues. However, it also gives the all-too-human Matt, his daughters, and his in-laws the chance to vent about her flaws and failures and infidelities without her actually hearing it. The venting, however, eases Matt's reconciliation with his wife, and makes the post-cremation ash-scattering into the ocean that much easier.To make peace with the world, we must sort out our mixed selfish and not-so-selfish feelings as we stumble towards some kind of resolution. Even when we make the ""right"" decisions, we often do so for at least partially ""wrong"" reasons. Matt and company learn this anguished and sobering lesson in ""The Descendants""",The Descendants
203,chaz-28,Underwritten script denies emotional punches film is looking for,4,29 December 2011,"There is something going on in Alexander Payne's The Descendants which makes me not care too much about its characters or plot. I cared about his earlier creations in Election and Sideways, but the family in this film feels stale and wooden. Just like his past films, the central character here, Matt King (George Clooney), is facing some tough problems, but this time they are not even of his design but are thrust upon him. Matt is even much more likable than the Broderick in Election or Giamatti in Sideways, but that does not make him any more interesting to watch.Matt is a lawyer on Oahu and is very well off. He is the sole decision-maker in a trust set up by his ancestors, Hawaiian royalty, in a large and undeveloped tract of land which hotel magnates and golf course developers are just aching to pay him a very large amount of money to take off of his hands. The majority of the other trustees are eager to sell as well, but Matt is holding all of the cards on the deal. The land issue is more background though because Matt's wife Elizabeth is in a coma. She hit her head while in a boat race and the doctors do not know if she will wake up or not.This leaves Matt, self-described in a monologue as the 'back-up parent', to deal with his two daughters. Since problems rarely come along one at a time, Matt also finds out at this point that Elizabeth was cheating on him with a local real estate tycoon, Brian Speer (Matthew Lillard). With his wife in a coma and an extremely significant land deal on the horizon, Matt makes the most obvious choice any Alexander Payne character would choose, he takes off to Kauai with his daughters and an imbecile surfer dude, Sid (Nick Krause), to spy on Brian Speer and possibly confront him.This road-trip, similar in respect to the trip to the vineyards in Sideways, lumps together an odd assortment of characters and then sits back to watch them as they place far too much emphasis on trivial events which are manifested into needless drama. Sideways was quirky, meandering in a pleasant way, and intellectual. The Descendants is more on par with Election; you do not particularly like the protagonists and instead of quirky, it feels more like plodding.However, just like Sideways, The Descendants has a definite sense of place. Present day Hawaii comes across as stifling not only in the city, but also on the beach while you are attempting to spy on the guy who made you a cuckold. Perhaps it is island fever impacting the actions of Matt and infecting the musty moods of the rest of the cast.The script does not rise to the level it set up for itself. Clooney and his elder daughter Alex (Shailene Woodley) are angry and on a quest, but the writing is flat and the pacing is off. There are one-dimensional and tiring extended breaks between plot points which may have achieved a deeper emotional impact if they tried a bit harder or if the daughters were not so snotty. They are crass and relentlessly bitter to the point of distraction. Matt has the most right to be angry and spiteful, but thankfully he does not hang it blatantly around his neck and choose to be a one note character ala Alex.I do not know why most of the rest of the film going public is raving about The Descendants. Alexander Payne has been great in the past, but he has misfired here. I have no doubt he will back with another enjoyable movie in the future, but I recommend you sit this one out or if you have not seen it, go back and enjoy Sideways. Leave The Descendants where they are, stewing in Hawaii.",The Descendants
204,Treyroo,Interesting and amusing family drama,8,24 November 2012,"Two big decisions that could forever affect your family's future are ahead of you. One of them already made, the other still being debated. Then you're hit with news you never saw coming and expected to deal with it quietly.Matt King (played by George Clooney) is lawyer in Hawaii and, by virtue of his profession, the sole executor a family trust that controls 25,000 acres of untouched land on Kauai that they will lose relatively soon thanks to the rule against perpetuities. In addition, he is married with two daughters and their mother has been in a coma for six months since a boating accident and the terms of her living will dictate that she will soon be disconnected from life-support. His younger daughter, Scottie (played by Amara Miller), is unaware and is holding out hope that her mother will wake up. His seventeen year-old daughter, Alex (played by Shailene Woodley), is away at a reform school, of sorts, and stills bears a great deal of resentment for her mother as a result of being sent away. She claims the motivation for that decision was her discovery of her mother's infidelity and says as much to her father. First rejecting the idea, Matt (Clooney) eventually accepts it and then decides to confront the other man in her life, bringing his daughters along under the pretense of a much needed respite.Hawaiian music isn't really my taste. Perhaps it's the tone, perhaps it's that I don't speak and could never learn the language. On the other hand, it does set the mood beautifully as do the many shots showcasing Hawaii's natural majesty. Clooney brings the conflict to life with a typically gripping performance and the cast all back him to varying degrees. I will say the part of Brian Speer, the man King (Clooney's) wife was having an affair with was not very well-acted by Matthew Lillard but it's a part with little screen time and few lines so it's forgivable.

This movie just feels like it could have only been set in Hawaii, despite having a story that is so universal. George Clooney kills this movie with one of his most emotionally powerful performances and it's why the film packs the punch it does. I think Woodley does a good job here, but she's still not fully formed as an actress yet.The Bad: Okay...controversial take here, but I think this film has some truly awkward and stilted dialog. Any scene with Sid just did not work for me. They were unfunny, his character seemed so out of place and I didn't understand where they were going.This is also personal but...the sheer amount of sexual dialog spoken by children in this film was...disturbing, to me. I felt like Clooney's reactions to some truly bizarre things being said were way too understated. I also felt like the movie's B plot was a bit undercooked; there was a lot thematically that wasn't really addressed.The Ugly: Sideways and The Descendants are very dialog heavy movies.

The path leads to a predictable 'let's not sell the land' payoff that's a yawn. The opening voice-over comments that in this Heaven-on-Earth people are people with the same problems as everyone else: marital infidelity, 21st century child rearing and great responsibility. Not quite as heady as brilliantly deconstructing lying male behavior or dissecting both sides of the thorny abortion issue to find them equally insane.Like a warm Tropical breeze, ""The Descendants"" softly brushes the cheek. It's pleasant, but ultimately it's just moving air.",The Descendants
207,Manal1987,A Huge Letdown!,2,26 February 2012,"Definitely the worst movie of the year!! I've seen it today in the movie theater and I deeply regret the two precious hours of my life I wasted on such a meaningless and unbearably boring drama. I kept turning and fidgeting in my seat wondering when this nightmare is ever going to end. The Oscars critics must have gone mad or blind to give The Descendants five Oscar nominations.Poor story. Lousy plot. Monotonous script. Spirit-less direction. Nondescript performance. There, I summed the movie up to you. No need to see it yourself.I have read many reviews before I go and watch it, and I have seen how people and critics described it as the definition of brilliance.

I wanted Matt (Clooney) to get a ""win"" in, amongst his tragic and overwhelming circumstances - but that's about all the passion I could muster. I welled up in the right scene, but I left the theatre feeling unmoved. The characters never felt real. The actors conveyed the material beyond what was really there, but for me that didn't rescue the film. For the record, Clooney in Michael Clayton was nothing short of perfection. ""Up in the Air"" very emotional and real. Big ups to Judy Greer the skilled character actress who kills it in everything she's in. Her performance in this as Julie Speer is no exception, but again, her big scene plays like the production minimized it rather than amplified it. For those who got something out of the film, glad you did. But had to speak for the minority.",The Descendants

With his kids that he didn't spent too much time with, he starts a new life with different priorities. The overall movie was nice but not the best movie of the year or the best performance of Clooney. I have seen a lot of movies of him and he even looked bored in this movie. Anyways, if you like drama and looking for a movie that you can watch as a family, go for it. The music is nice, scenery is beautiful and story is fine. The biggest downside is, it is long and sometimes gets really boring. Nevertheless, it is worth watching.",The Descendants
210,stephenlovelette,"Underwhelmed, but still optimistic.",6,28 June 2014,"Alexander Payne does not direct movies for me.Much like Wes Anderson's work, I appreciate the look, about 25% of the humor and the smart writing. I also applaud the directors for having a distinct visual style to their films.After The Descendants I feel the same way I did after watching Nebraska; somewhat disappointed, pretty bored, and uninspired.What's good about this movie is it's subtle, but it's a long wait and a lot of Hawaiian soundtrack in between each nuance. I think more of the humor is supposed to hit home.George Clooney's the best part. This is at least his second time in the starring role where the movie opens with his voice-over. Up in the Air is another.Payne's clearly a fan of reversals and double reversals. He likes to build a swell of emotion, rinse it away with a wave of disappointment, and then provide a glimmer of hope through an unexpected and unprecedented character's behavior.For example, in Nebraska, against all odds, Will Forte finds Bruce Dern's dentures lost in abandoned train tracks. When he shows them to his father, Dern claims they don't belong to him. Eventually, grabbing them, he says, ""Of course they're my teeth."" Up until that moment, we're given no hint Dern's character has a sense of humor. A similar exchange takes place when they steal the wrong air compressor.This type of character interaction recurs throughout The Descendants. For example, Alex's friend Sid (played by Nick Krause) seems like an oblivious moron. He says something inappropriate to Matt, causing him to pull over the car.Matt: (to Alex) Your friend is completely retarded, you know that?Sid: Hey man, I've got a little brother who's retarded. Don't use that word in derogatory fashion. Matt: Oh.Sid: (laughing) Psych! No I don't have a retarded brother.Ultimately, I come out of these moments feeling disappointed and unfulfilled. Sure the exchange catches me off guard but that jolt seems to be the end to the means. It happens four or five times. I guess that and the stilted humor are what I essentially disagree with. The shocking reversals and muted humor don't add up to a great film. (Despite such potential in the story's framework.)Krause turns in a solid performance as well, but the scene in which he laughs at 'Tu-Tu' feels off.The character of Scottie (played by Amara Miller) is painful. It reminds me of how I feel about Abigail Breslin in Little Miss Sunshine, another quirkedy with an annoying little girl. I don't understand the appeal in these types of characters.When Scottie flicks off the well-meaning guy in the restaurant, is that supposed to be funny? The 'twat' scene, the cursing and stupidity? When she's wearing her sister's lingerie and dancing poolside? When they have the conversation about the sand in her bikini top?Are all of those moments supposed to make us laugh? They're neither funny nor cute and detract greatly from the overall film.Look. I know every feminist shakes her head at me and replies with some dismissive comment like, ""Oh just get over it,"" or ""Well then look forward to parenthood buddy."" But my criticism is the exact same as it was after Moonrise Kingdom (a Wes Anderson film ironically enough):It does the male audience a great disservice by having an excess of screen time featuring scantily clad little girls.Not because of some gross proclivity.It's the same aversion I feel to images of male genitalia. Every second it remains on screen, I cringe into the seat cushion a little bit further.And I only bring up this natural feeling of discomfort because I think that's what Payne's trying to 'challenge' (so to speak, I'm using that word loosely). Or he thinks she's adorable and funny. Either way, I don't think anything is gained through Scottie's character.It's illustrative of a pattern I've recognized in A. Payne's recent filmography. Going back to the reversals thing, he likes to have women in the polar extremes of age exploring sexual and explicit themes. Just like June Squibb, an older woman, pulling up her skirt in front of some guy's tombstone. She's rubbing it in the dead guy's face that he never got inside her pants. I find that scene morbid and off-putting; not empowering, insightful or worthy of a chuckle.There's a beautiful camera shot down a set of hospital stairs, while Matt's voice-over speaks above the sound of his ascending footsteps. He is heading to find out his wife must be taken off the machines and will soon die.And the entire movie is a series of sequences; a number of character interactions where others talk down to Matt about his choices. Like the staircase, they can only watch from above, and patronize.Except the kids, all other characters condescend to Matt, are inconsiderate of his feelings and pride themselves for praising his comatose wife in comparison. It's mostly a despicable lot he encounters.And yet he keeps his mouth shut. Towards the end, we see a tiny victory in this choice.But this 'glimmer in the darkness' doesn't distill the discomforting sadness (and often boredom) one must wade through to get there.I don't know. I'm not trying to rain on the Payne parade, but it's just not my spot of tea.The Descendants is a good enough movie. I call it 'good' because it's visually stunning, and intelligent. It's easily watchable, but there's just a lot of better stuff out there. Especially starring Clooney.Might I suggest the aforementioned Up in the Air, instead, perhaps?It touches on a bit more sadness, but it's just as intelligent plus more captivating and fun.Best of all?No quirky teenage girls.",The Descendants
211,Thunderbuck,Payne's best,9,6 May 2012,"Alexander Payne has a fantastic eye for characters, and his movies are completely driven by them. ""About Schmidt"" has been high on my list of favourites for a long time, and it really has almost no story at all, but Jack Nicholson's performance in the title role shows an amazing balance between the ridiculous and the sublime.""The Descendents"" might just rank as Payne's best, because the whole film is populated by characters that are as well-written. Clooney is great in this, showing a vulnerability and at times even an awkwardness that is not what we typically expect in his performances.I find some of the creative choices here interesting; some of the most important events happen off-camera, leaving the movie to focus not so much on what happens, but on how everyone reacts to it. I found this movie to have some of the most memorable, authentic characters I've seen in years....and I love the way Hawaii is filmed in this movie. It isn't any deliberate attempt to show it badly, but you see things like suburbs, and freeways, and skyscrapers that don't normally make it into a ""Hawaii"" movie. Not to say that there aren't other, more scenic shots, and I liked the balance. In this way, Hawaii itself becomes something of a character.",The Descendants

213,warthogjump,Was honestly expecting more,7,14 January 2012,"This is a great movie, no doubt about it. But given the combination of golden globe, Oscar buzz and positive feedback on IMDb, I expected much more.The story and the premise of the movie is perfect. In fact, the tagline caught my attention enormously: ""trying to reconnect with daughters."" That is exactly the type of movie I like. Instantly, I could tell this was a movie about character development and human connection, usually the type of movies with the greatest potential.Unfortunately, it was merely decent, but not special. It felt like the movie built up so much potential, but failed to release it at a certain point during the movie. The whole movie, for me, felt too introductory in nature. Not necessarily the plot, because the plot does evolve, but the overall ""feel"" of the movie felt preliminary to a bigger and more dramatic event which never happened.It's not easy to explain my feelings towards the movie because the fault wasn't necessarily technical or specific. But it did linger around and distracted my viewing somewhat. I felt like there was still more to explore in both Clooney's character and the character of his daughters. Also, I think this element alone impacted on Clooney's performance. His performance was good, definitely, but again, because I felt like there was more to be explored, naturally, I also felt like his performance could have been added to (but not necessarily improved).Given the Oscar buzz of this movie, I have to compare it to other movies of a similar nature. And unfortunately, I didn't feel like there was sufficient connection between the characters...although the potential to reach that connection was established, it was not acted upon in my opinion. Unfortunately I have to say there have been better developed ""re-establishing connection"" movies.In summary, this is an enjoyable movie, but it is missing some important elements which deteriorates the viewing experience to some extent.",The Descendants
214,Nobody-27,"Too long for a soap opera, too shallow for a drama...",3,4 January 2012,"It would be hard not to go in to see this film with relatively high hopes. George Clooney managed to surprise me more than once, and I will admit to becoming somewhat of a fan thanks to his performances in ""Up In The Air"" and ""Michael Clayton"". In ""The Descendents"" he is brilliant as is the rest of the cast, especially Shailene Woodley (I predict great future for her!), and Nick Krause who was equally great. Other performances were also pleasure to watch, but that's where the list of film's good qualities ends.The film is a story about a rich lawyer (George Clooney) who is caught up in family drama when his wife ends up in coma due to a boating accident. The film is set in Hawaii, for no good reason, except to give us plenty of Hawaiian music, which I love but found annoyingly overused here; not to mention that it made no sense and felt disjointed in relation to the story.While many are touched by the drama of a mother/wife being in coma, I was not. The depiction was too shallow and predictable to be touching. Most everyone manages to be angry at her for her mistakes while she was alive, and the anger expressed, monologues told and drama that ensued were all too soap opera-ish to be interesting at all. No character made any real progress in any way, they all just stay their same not-so-smart selves. Those things which I wanted to see addressed somehow (e.g. the younger daughter's behavior), stay untouched. Those things which I'd rather not spend any time looking at such as a comatose woman's face, are shown in shots which drag on and on and on...All in all, if it were not for great performances, this film would be a terrible waste of time. This way, if you are film buff who needs to stay in the loop, you may want to see it just for those performances, although a film such as this one does not really have any drama to inspire anything Oscar worthy in any of the actors.Bottom line: great location such as Hawaii, long shots of dying wife and good actors, are not what makes a good film. Every great or even good film has something slightly magical about it, and this one has none of that, which is what makes such a bore.",The Descendants
215,middleburg,Mana from Cinematic Heaven,10,25 January 2012,"Mahalo, cast and crew and everyone associated with this great, funny, heartbreaking and beautiful film. It is a film anyone who has lost a loved one too soon (It is ALWAYS to soon to lose a loved one) can identify with from the opening scenes of jarring Hawaiian images to a simple, quiet, comforting family tableau, perfect in its simplicity. The stages of grief: disbelief, anger, denial, resolution, are all there. But so is a kaleidoscope of everyday life that surrounds the grief, that makes the grief bearable--the moments of surprising humor, the life stories both ridiculous and truthful, that make life fascinating, that make life the great human comedy and great human tragedy that keeps us guessing, keeps us striving, keeps us coping and enduring.The characters are all vividly etched, and powerfully portrayed by a stellar cast from George Clooney's majestic, conflicted, ultimately heartbreaking Matt, to his beloved, infuriating, but ultimately wise and charming daughters, Shailene Woodley and Amara Miller, to the enjoyably goofy teenage boyfriend with a surprisingly poignant past, Nick Krause's Sid to a whole host of neighbors and friends and extended family, all of whom seem oddly familiar--so carefully cast and played with short revealing moments highlighting each of them. What an assortment of characters! SAG -- take notice of this ensemble when you give out your award this year!! There are images in this film that are sure to endure: the silent cry of grief underwater of Matt's elder daughter, the final, haunting ceremony in the waters of Waikiki, as the ashes of Matt's wife drift away in the azure waters, the calm, comforting walk along the beach of Matt and his family as day turns into the ""only in Hawaii"" dusk, with the golden light highlighting their newly discovered bond, the quiet spying through the slightly opened hospital room door on Elizabeth's old ""p***k"" of a father, as his face becomes contorted with unbearable, painful grief as he says his final goodbye. The moments of grief are handled so carefully and are vivid but also understated, so that they become all the more powerful, and we never feel manipulated -- we only feel as if we are sharing the feelings of these memorable and exquisitely etched characters. Somehow, we ultimately wish all of them well, with all their tremendous imperfections. They are human -- all too human. And, we feel for them and we celebrate them. Alexander Payne has created some of the most heartfelt films over the last decade -- ""About Schmidt"" and ""Sideways"". With ""The Descendents"" he has given us his most deeply felt film yet -- a film to treasure, to cry and laugh with, and to hold dear to our hearts, a film that keeps us guessing, that resonates with life's unpredictability, that ultimately celebrates life and love and family, told with warmth and wisdom and genuine insight -- the best film of 2011.

216,donuthaters12,Great Performances And Gorgeous Photography,8,16 October 2013,"Alexander Payne's The Descendants is a drama film, with a splash of comedy, that tells the tale of this man who is under stress and pressure from certain aspects of his life and he is finding a way to get through it. This film is very well done and is very deserving of it's accolades, in it's screenplay in particular.The Descendants is written by Alexander Payne, Nat Faxon and Jim Rash. This is both Faxon and Rash's first film. This film is very well written with a plot that doesn't lose too much focus on the main issues, which is sometimes found with comedic drama films like this, and the writers have written great dialogue that is believable and not too overly sentimental. The films maintains it's comedic tones through the dialogue from both Clooney, Woodley, and Krause. There are moments where the film feels heartbreaking but there are also times where you end up chuckling at a line for at least a minute as it either came out of nowhere or it just felt so real that it's funny. If a film is able to make me laugh and feel saddened, that is something I am very inclined to revisit in the future.Alexander Payne directed this film and I came into this with no expectations as this is my first experience with the director. There are a few films from Payne's catalogue that I definitely want to see. Payne's handling with this film is definitely excellent. The way he handles this story, which if handled by a different director can be emotional and overly depressing, is very effective. Payne decided to keep the film's tone positive and at times comedic. This decision helps keep the film light and and have the audience come out of it feeling good and satisfied. The film's positive tone is due to the photography, dialogue and the score of the film.The film's photography was handled by Phedon Papamichael, who has worked with Payne before in his previous film, Sideways. Papamichael was also the DP of other films that I have seen as well, The Ides of March and 3:10 To Yuma. Both films has a gritty or dark feel to it's photography, so seeing his work here in The Descendants was shocking. His photography here is beautiful and bright. This intention definitely works with the direction that Payne was going for. There are multiple moments where Hawaii looks amazing. Papamichael definitely show the beauty that Hawaii offers and is definitely ironic when the voice over at the start of the film comes in. He definitely shows that Hawaii is paradise, regardless of what Matt King says. The intimate moments, conversations between characters, are mainly composed of close shots with focus on their emotions and reactions which is critical in showing the connection of each character to the topic that is being discussed, whether it's about Elizabeth or the property in Hawaii.The Descendants is soundtrack driven rather than score driven. This would have been a great opportunity to create a beautiful score to drive the film but the song choices for this film does it's job well. The songs doesn't feel like a soundtrack that stands out but rather it feels appropriate for the setting and adds on to the lightness that Payne is trying to create. The soundtrack isn't the greatest aspect of the film but it does add to what makes this film great.In my first viewing, I used to think it was a Clooney driven performance but in my second viewing, I started to see that it is both a Shailene Woodley and George Clooney driven film. They play off with each other well and it's definitely entertaining to watch. Clooney was already someone I expected a lot from but it was Woodley who definitely surprised and made me a fan of her acting. I'm glad to see a daughter in a film that shows a lot of her personality. Woodley shows the bad side of her, the edgy side of her, and the emotional and vulnerable side of her. The other supporting cast were great, in particular Judy Greer, Beau Bridges and Robert Forster.The Descendants is a film that kept me attracted to it after my first experience with the film due to it's striking photography and fantastic acting between Clooney and Woodley. It may grow on me further during subsequent viewings and the film has the potential to become a much more appreciated film in the future.",The Descendants
217,intern-88,If they gave out Oscars for mediocrity,6,6 June 2012,"The Academy Awards was the brainchild of MGM producer Louis B Mayer, and began as an attempt to reward filmic excellence at a time when filmmakers and film actors had little credibility. A far cry from the glitzy, orchestrated performance that it is today, the very first Oscars ceremony in 1929 was a low-key, private function in the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. Guest tickets were a mere five dollars, only 15 awards were handed out and, having announced the winners three months previously, many of the nominees didn't even bother to show up.Today, the Oscars is the biggest night in the Hollywood calendar, and winning one of the famed statuettes is as much a confirmation of one's status in the business as it is a mark of artistic merit. While each year the nominations for the 24 categories recognise some truly worthy films and filmmakers, the top awards remain a kind of elite club that honours the staying power of the lucky winner rather than the quality of their work that year.After making critically acclaimed, box-office smashes for three decades, Martin Scorsese earned his first award for Best Director in 2006 with The Departed, which was far from his finest hour. On the other end of the scale there is Sandra Bullock, who outraged the film world in 2009 when she was named Best Actress for her astoundingly half-decent performance in The Blind Side. As such, the highest honours have become little more than a pat on the back for managing to stay in the limelight for a decent amount of time.When the nominations for the eighty-fourth awards ceremony were announced at the end of January, Alexander Payne's The Descendants was one of two films that hit the hallowed trifecta, gaining nominations for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor, for George Clooney's lead performance. The film sees Payne at nowhere near the height of his capabilities and Clooney in typically semi-competent form yet, if the pattern bears, it should be a formidable contender at the Oscars this year.Following the tried and true formula Payne perfected with About Schmidt (2002) and Sideways (2004), The Descendants centres on an emotionally powerless man muddling his way through a tragicomic series of events. Matt King (George Clooney) is a Hawaiian, workaholic lawyer who has little time for his dysfunctional family. This all changes when his wife Elizabeth (Patricia Hastie), falls into a coma after a speedboat accident. Soon the doctor's tell him that Elizabeth won't recover and, following the stipulations of her living will, they must remove her from life-support.Matt is left to sort out his wife's last wishes, reconnect with his daughters, and negotiate the high-profile sale of hundreds of acres of untouched Hawaiian land that has been in his family for generations. The plot thickens when his wayward eldest, Alexandra (Shailene Woodley), returns from boarding school and tells him that, in the months before the accident, his wife was having an affair. The rest of the film follows Matt in his attempts to come to terms with all that has happened and regain a sense of what is important in his life.The Descendants is based on a novel of the same name by Hawaiian author Kaui Hart Hemmings and is adapted by Payne and his co-writers with care and warmth. His direction is light but expressive, and the gorgeous landscapes of Hawaii serve as a perfect foil for the bittersweet turns of the narrative. Nevertheless, the film bears a certain schmaltzy gloss that compromises this delicate balance.What made Payne's previous work so hard-hitting was that despite being extremely cynical and closed off, his protagonists were human and their struggles had, for all their dark humour, a pang of reality. Matt King is presented to us as a kind of young Warren Schmidt yet, despite his curmudgeonly narration insisting he's damaged goods, he regains his zest for life pretty easily. Where Payne usually offers only a glimmer of hope for his wayward anti-heroes, we see Matt King take everything in his stride and come out a better, more rounded individual for it. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, except that Matt's journey from emotionally detached malcontent to bleeding-heart family man is incredibly unconvincing.While there are several moving scenes, the film is nevertheless marred by its painfully generic script. Clooney's opening narration, in which he refutes the claim that all Hawaiians live in paradise, with the less than elegantly put 'Paradise can go f*** itself', offers about as much emotional insight as the diary entry of a dejected teenager. Similarly, as Matt starts to soften, his Hallmark-card platitudes about love and forgiveness, feel incredibly cheap for a screenwriter of Payne's skill.Many critics have deemed this Clooney's greatest performance to date. While this may well be true, this isn't really saying much. He plays the inexpressive, closed-off patriarch rather well, but this seems down to his ineptitude more than anything else.As it draws to a close, The Descendants regains some semblance of the understated poignancy for which Payne is known, but on the whole it remains an underwhelming story about reconciliation and doing the right thing by our loved ones. It dilutes Payne's classic themes into a far more contrived format and gives Clooney a decent role in which to flaunt his average abilities. In short, it is Oscar-worthy through and through. Payne and Clooney have certainly stuck around long enough to deserve recognition and this sweet but pedestrian film is the perfect vehicle to earn them a couple of those gaudy statuettes.",The Descendants
218,vovers1,Supporting cast steals the show,7,6 March 2021,"Clooney really delivers in this Hawaiian drama but he is propped up by tremendous work from ALL the supporting features.

219,mistarkus,Not much to this movie,5,21 November 2011,"Interesting to showcase Hawaii, the off the resort real community flavor of its residents and also the beauty of the tropical landscapes hovering behind white beaches and azure waters making you wish you were there on a cold November day, however, there is not much to this movie. It was neither entertaining nor was it interesting. There really is not much of an interesting story premise. A rather well off man who owns land in Hawaii whose wife gets into a boating accident and is in a coma decides to bring back his kids during this difficult time. The major drive and climaxes deal with decisions as to what to do with the wife who is in a coma and what to do with the land thats in his name. One of these decisions unfortunately becomes very predictable.For these mostly slice of life tales, character creation and development are crucial. Unfortunately its difficult to care for these characters. The wife in the coma has only 1 aspect to her character and personality and that one thing which we already learned from the previews is that she cheated on him. You don't feel sad that she is in a coma, maybe thats a good thing, but you just don't feel. You don't really care about any of the other characters either. The children don't have a lot of dimensions to them. The supporting characters of the cousins, the wife's lover and his wife have very small roles. George Clooneys character isn't too interesting either. As opposed to this filmmaker's main characters in his other movies, the main character in this movie has rather cliché emotions and feelings. It is mildly interesting to see how his twisted feeling are portrayed towards his wife he recently discovered was deceptive yet is in a coma.This was disappointing because the filmmaker's previous movies delved so much into interesting believable characters with plots and writing that emanated a fun, creative, dark humor.",The Descendants
220,jhigginbotham151,The Descendants is an emotionally powerful film,9,27 April 2014,"Clooney plays Matt King, lawyer and decision maker on whether to sell Hawaiian land his ancestors left to him and his relatives. As well as that, he has two daughters, Scottie (played by Amara Miller) and Alexandra (played by Shailene Woodley) who he has never had time for in the past and after his wife Elizabeth gets into a boating accident and is left in a coma, he has to look after his two girls who he knows very little about.The plot seems to set you up for the typical Comedy-Drama, but then they throw a curve-ball by telling you that there is no hope for Elizabeth and when they unplug the machines she will die in the days following. This surprised me and what follows is one of the most heartwarming yet heartbreaking stories iv seen on film in a while.Matt King as a character simply cant cope with the fact his wife is going to die, stopping and simply gazing into nothingness as he realizes the inevitable is drawing ever closer and he is the one who has to tell close friends and family. A scene towards the end where Matt talks to his wife and says his final goodbye is one of the saddest moments I have ever seen in film and Clooney deserves all the Praise he gets for it.Woodley also surprises as Alexandra. Initially appearing to be the cliché, angry teenager, she soon opens up and we get to see the real her. We get to see her grieve for the mother that she has fought with, the mother that put her in a boarding school, the mother that she still loves dearly and the performance Woodley put forth I still think was worthy of Best Actress, even at that young age.Overall, The Descendants is one of the most emotionally engaging films Iv seen in recent memory and will stay with me as a film that was honest. Never trying to be overly dramatic, just focusing on what the characters were going through was enough for me and i'm sure many other people to burst in to tears by the end.",The Descendants
221,TheMovieSnob247,"A well made and subtly good family drama, but slightly overrated.",7,17 June 2012,"The film is about a husband who's wife suffers a serious accident and is unlikely to pull through. He suddenly finds himself needing to be a single parent to his daughters (after not being a very attentive father), discovering his wife's betrayal and having to tell everyone she's dying. I like the fact that the film doesn't gloss over all the ugliness and conflicting emotions one goes through in this situation; anger, frustration, sadness and helplessness. Clooney takes you through the range of them and convincingly so. He does subtly portray an every day man trying to get through it and handle it the best he can without losing his dignity. One of is better performances. But I have to say I'm surprised he got the Golden Globe; Brad Pitt's performance in Moneyball and Jean Dujardin in The Artist were clearly superior and I preferred Clooney's performance in Up in the Air much more because that felt a bit more believable to me. With that said, I still liked the film. I loved the cinematography. The beauty of the islands were captured really well in the film, so much so it was like I was there. And those scenes really highlighted some of the reflective family moments in the film (and in my opinion felt the most real). While there were very few moments that moved me it's still worth watching. At the end of the film I had to ask myself how excited am I to watch this again? And my answer was not very much and that's why this film is a bit over rated in my opinion. A 2nd viewing will probably be warranted and maybe more effective; it seems this is a bit of a personal film for some and I probably can't really relate as much say someone with children or someone who's been in a similar situation.www.themoviesnob.ca@the_movie_snob",The Descendants

223,AliceofX,A Film About Family,7,6 March 2016,"The Descendants is a great portrayal of family. It shows it in a realistic way with the sort of characters you recognize in your own family. It is at times not the prettiest picture but one that rings true. The very name The Descendants"" might seem puzzling at first but it is basically the theme of the film. This is a film about what we leave behind and to whom. Our legacy, in other words.For me the most interesting thing in this movie was the relationship between Matt (George Clooney) and Alexandra (Shailene Woodley). They play the roles of absent father and rebellious daughter. They fight one another while both try to protect the younger sister Scottie from the harsher facts of life.Besides the family drama Matt also has land/money drama. He and his relatives are about to sell land that has been theirs for many generations. Matt is originally for it, but at the very last moment he refuses to sign the papers. He then gives a great speech about how it is not theirs to sell, it was entrusted to them. It was a great moment, but all the time I kept thinking – is there a more selfish reason for this? We had previously learned that his wife's lover would greatly benefit from this sale so is his secret motive to screw the guy over? It kind of ruined a great moment.But overall The Descendants is a solid drama film which I enjoyed watching.",The Descendants
224,GeneSiskel,Island Tour,5,27 November 2011,"Don't believe the hype: this is a thin movie. George Clooney plays an everyman with a trust fund who, during the course of the film, reorients himself marginally on the moneymaking-family axis. That's it, folks. He has a pair of cute foul-mouthed daughters, a wife in a coma who has cheated on him, an extended family of laid-back cousins, and -- as the back-up child-rearer -- a terminal inability to recall his daughters' friends' names or remember when the pool cleaner will next arrive. In other words he's just like us except that he's gorgeous, has more money, is descended from island royalty, and lives on Oahu. If the film had been placed in Findlay, Ohio or cast with someone other than Clooney in the lead role, it would not have earned back its budget.Clooney is cast so far against type that he isn't believable. In the opening scenes, as he struggles with his daughters' acting out and learns of his wife's infidelity, he sputters like a sitcom character, like Ozzie Nelson on a bad day. Later he learns to cry, but the tears spring from nowhere. Ultimately the director's resolution points us to memories and ice cream in front of the family TV. Satisfied? I'm afraid I wasn't. This film is nothing but a feel-good gesture to middle American values wrapped in Hawaiian shirts and accompanied by a soundtrack of native Hawaiian music.",The Descendants
225,boatsfra,Fantastic movie...Here's your Oscar George,10,6 January 2012,"Watched Descendants today...knew by the reviews it was going to be good, but wasn't prepared for what I saw. Mr. Clooney has delivered an Oscar-worthy performance, and Director Payne has added to his already outstanding list of movies. Every character in the movie, EVERY ONE...jumps off the screen so effortlessly...you care about each one of them and once you think you have them figured out, Mr. Payne throws wrenches and curve balls and you are at his mercy. George is at his best as Matthew King, a man who's life has taken some turns that he wasn't ready for. His daughters steal the show though and take us on a great ride. It's not an action packed thriller, there's hardly any mystery, and it's not a chick-flick. If you liked Sideways, you will love Descendants.",The Descendants

His name is Alexander Payne and he has many more masterpieces for the future at his belt.Like many of his films, The Descendants is uplifting.

The film is throughout sensual it starts calm, continues calm and ends calm. I love this spirit in Payne's movie and I love how puts his characters in hard positions and make us watch their efforts to solve the problems inside them.The Descendants is definitely a movie that is worth watching.

228,thegodfathersaga,a mellow film,8,21 January 2012,"this is a mellow film. having a sensible warm, pleasant quality to it, the film presents lost and overwhelmed characters being honest and sorrowful in their own way. i don't know if this story is very personal to Alexander Payne or it's just his style, but what i loved most is that the film tries to do just that: telling the heartfelt story with delicacy in managing complicated emotions uniquely; Payne doesn't try to instill a message or a moral to the story, implying a trivial meaning. it could have easily been downgraded to a film about the importance of family relations and parenting through a crisis; which i was fearing in the beginning when the rebellious, problematic daughters were introduced; but thankfully, Payne knows what he is doing. there is a good feeling of tranquility all throughout, led to by the right decisions not to include many background sound effects and orchestrated musical score. it helped George Clooney a lot to do great in his role that the Payne knew exactly how to deliver a sincere emotional journey",The Descendants
229,plpregent,A bittersweet and heartwarming comedy/drama,8,19 June 2018,"I found out about The Descendants on IMDb as I was looking for films that were shot in Hawaii (I will be spending some time in Kauai in July, and wanted to have a peek at the beautiful landscapes and breathtaking views that await me there). I ended up reading quite a few very positive reviews, reading a bit more on Alexander Payne and, ultimately, watching the film. The Hawaii setting is pretty atypical, I guess, but serves this film beautifully. The opening sequence, accompanied by a solid and almost poetic narration by George Clooney, sets the tone right away: The Descendants tells a bittersweet story in a paradisiac setting, but none of the heartaches depicted therein, are any less painful. However, the film always manages to handle even the harshest emotions in a mysteriously peaceful manner.The film touches on themes that are universal (death, family, faithfulness, forgiveness, etc.), but that have rarely been tackled using such an approach: it's subtly delivered, with a much appreciated restraint as far as acting goes, and often times with tinges of humor. Almost every emotional moment is also accompanied with beautiful Hawaiian music, bringing a touch of smoothness to these moments without toning down the emotion of these scenes.All characters are great and evolve beautifully throughout. It is beautiful to watch this broken family unite and solidify as a clan through adversity. George Clooney's performance is incredible, as he always appears to somewhat keep his head above water, despite being taken onto an emotional rollercoaster that would sink anyone to rock bottom. He delivers emotions in so many subtle shades of anger, sadness, incomprehension, good will and...love. Shailene Woodley plays Alexandra, his rebellious teenage daughter, who ends up being his greatest ally. Amara Miller, as Scottie (his younger daughter), delivers a mostly humorous character with just the right amount of heart. Nick Crause, who plays Sid, has a couple of really good scenes, including a hilarious one where he interacts with Robert Forster, who plays Matt King's father-in-law. Just a stellar cast all around, delivering wonderfully-written dialogue and characters. There are many words of wisdom spoken in there, especially in the narration, which, sadly, disappears mid-way through the film. That was the only letdown for me.Payne's direction flows smoothly and makes good use (although not abusive) of the beautiful Hawaii setting. I found the sub-plot about the sale of the piece of land owned by the King family not to be of the greatest interest, but ultimately, it ended up serving the story pretty well and telling the audience a lot about Matt King. Overall, The Descendants is a great lesson in writing and in overall emotion delivery. This could have been a heavy drama. Instead, it's a bittersweet and heartwarming comedy/drama that should spark interest in Alexander Payne's other films for those (like me!) who are not familiar with them.",The Descendants
230,natalierosen,Incredible!!,9,25 December 2011,"This is simply, in my opinion, an EXCELLENT film. Yet again George Clooney executes a difficult role with depth, compassion and an entire panoply of emotion that the script dictates. The film was gripping, heart wrenching and tragic as the web families weave has grave emotional consequences. Clooney is at his best when he has much going on internally but but does not necessarily exhibit it externally. It seems to be characteristic of many of his roles. He is riveting.I was not sure at first if Patricia Hastie, who plays George Clooney's comatose wife and has no dialogue, was a manikin since she plays, what must have been one of the most difficult roles in film and Oscar worthy as best supporting actress, with utter credulity. It truly is an amazingly realistic performance.I cannot say anything was amiss in this film except that I thought the crucial meeting between Clooney and Brian Spear's wife was surprising if not in part questionable. Still, it was necessary to the film's content. I give this film a decided thumbs up!",The Descendants

232,TheConnoisseurReviews,A film about a guy who finds out his dieing wife was cheating on him.,10,15 June 2012,"""The Descendants"" is about re-connecting with your loved ones. In the film the main character has no clue of what his family is up to and when he does find out he doesn't know how to react because he was never there. Another element of the film is family and how we need them to get through our tough times. We might be annoyed with them or we even might hate them, but when it truly comes down to it, they will be the first to stand up. The last major theme the film targets is forgiveness. We need to learn to forgive and move on with out lives. If we linger in the past we can never move forward and we'll constantly beating ourselves up over it.The directing is pretty solid in the film. The director, Alexander Payne, captures the feel of Hawaii, the setting of the film. He doesn't make it look like some tropical island that is isolated from the mayhem of the real world. It gives us the viewer a real take of this island so many of us think is untouched by man. The cinematography only adds to the experience. While the director is portraying the realness of the island, it never forgets that this place still is very beautiful. Writing is top notch. The things the characters say are real and in the situation they are in would be very normal. They use some profane language, which usually turns me off certain movies, but they use it effectively and with viable reason and not just for shock. The overall film is wholesome and sweet. It doesn't get cynical or tries to copy what is popular, it is just pure wholesome bliss of pure storytelling.The acting is really good as well. George Clooney give a marvelous performance and probably the best of last year (haven't seem ""The Artist""). His wife is about to die in the film, but he finds out that she was cheating on him. You can see that he really loves her and wanted things to work out and he regrets not giving her enough attention. However, you can also see his frustration and helplessness on the whole situation. Another stand out is Shailene Woodley, who is also frustrated with her mother, but upon hearing of her situation she too becomes frustrated and helpless. She goes toe to toe with Clooney and their chemistry is really good. They feel like a real father and daughter, they joke, tease, and feel each other's pain. I really like how their relationship develops throughout the film.Overall, ""The Descendants"" is a really good film. It is storytelling at its highest order. The relationships are genuine and the way the director manages to capture the overall bliss of Hawaii is great. I love how they don't linger on melodrama and play off the mother's situation to get a reaction from its viewers. It is funny, heart warming, and a fun ride of enough emotional depth. Another noteworthy part of the film is its score, which is fantastic. Very subtle and gives the right amount of feel for Hawaii. I give it 5/5, great storytelling accompanied by fantastic performances, and enough wholesome entertainment.""Awesomeness""",The Descendants
233,socialmedia-437-956449,Despair in Paradise,8,16 August 2012,"There is little that tempts the viewer to book a Hawaiian holiday after watching ""The Descendants"". In Alexander Payne's first film since 2004's Oscar winning ""Sideways"", sun-kissed beaches, blue skies and carefree watersports make way for leaden clouds and choppy ocean swells. It rains often, forcing characters to awkwardly run for cover in their flip-flops. At home, George Clooney, his hair greying with worry, sits up at nights, working on legal papers. There's not a slice of guava to be seen and pineapples are extinct. In short, this is all a far cry from the reverie of Elvis Presley's ""Paradise Hawaiian Style"".Clooney plays Matt King, father to a ten-year-old tearaway Scottie (Amara Miller) and her equally rebellious sister Alexandra (Shailene Woodley). The Kings, and by that I mean the extended family of cousins and aunts living across a number of islands, are preparing to sell a large parcel of land which has been in the family for generations. Resort developers promise the clan untold millions. Matt, however, has other preoccupations. His wife, recently injured in a boating accident, lies in a coma. She will never recover, doctors tell him. Matt has to break the news to his wayward breed and, in the process, assume the role of parent.None of this is new territory for Clooney who, at various times in his career, has taken delight in portraying misguided zealots (""The Men Who Stare at Goats""), soulless suits (""Up In The Air"") and dandyish egotists (""O' Brother, Where Art Thou?""). In truth, he is more restrained here. We can't imagine the Clooney of ""Ocean's Eleven"" as anything other than a fussy, if suave, lothario. In contrast, when his daughter asks him what he'd like to eat in a restaurant, he waves her away with ""Order me anything"". His clothing, for the most part, consists of half-sleeved shirts, shorts and flip-flops. Yet as storms close around his family, Matt takes stock of the situation and steers the King clan away from looming danger. Clooney's is a subtle performance, free of histrionics.""The Descendants"" also bookends a series of four films about men in crisis, which started with Matthew Broderick fraying at the seams in ""Election"". In that film, Broderick's middle aged angst, expressed through his all-or-nothing hatred of a high school over-achiever, was a comic exaggeration which sealed the character's fall from grace. In ""Sideways"", Paul Giamatti showed us that men stop living when they too eagerly embrace their obsessions. In ""The Descendants"", Clooney isn't looking to upend his life: he wants to make up for his previous absenteeism. When he learns of his dying wife's affair and travels with his eldest daughter to confront the object of her unfaithfulness – a property dealer called Brian Speer – Matt doesn't resort to threats, abuse or violence. The scene is quietly played out in Speer's holiday home, at an island in the kitchen. He even agrees not to inform the salesman's wife of his transgressions.In the end, death marks the end of the whole affair. After his wife passes away, the family scatters her ashes at sea. And in the most peaceful moment of an otherwise blustery film, Matt later settles down to eat ice cream and watch television with his children. The scene, which runs for nearly 90 seconds, is near silent and has the Kings watching a TV set in front of them. For the first time in a while, it seems, the bad weather has vanished.",The Descendants
234,serafinogm,What an agreeable and satisfying revelation this film was!,10,10 October 2015,"Was recommended the film by my son, purchased a copy and sat down for a view and honestly didn't expect much but it took just minutes and I was captive to the story! My respect and admiration for Clooney's acting abilities has grown (save for 'The American' and 'The Monuments Men', which are total crap!) however with offerings like 'Up In the Air', 'Burn After Reading', 'Syriana', 'The Men who stare at Goats', 'Michael Clayton'. 'Oh Brother where art Thou' and others as well, Clooney has cemented his acting credentials with me. But George please pick your material a little more carefully. I purchased 'The Monuments Men' because you were in it, couldn't finish it and got 3 dollars in trade for it at a used book store (and it was a Blu-ray copy). It's hard to forgive that but I've managed but I will do some vetting of your work in the future. At any rate I highly recommend 'The Descendants' to everyone, if you have any intelligence at all you will enjoy this film! I promise!",The Descendants
235,saschakrieger,"A look at life as we (don't) know it: unsentimental, unspectacular, honest",9,7 February 2012,"Matthew King is a lucky man. Being a native of Hawaii, he is living in paradise, he is the inheritor of one of the last untouched bays on Oahu and a direct descendant of Hawaii's last great king, he has a successful law practice, a beautiful wife and two wonderful daughters. But when we hear him at the start of the film, we do not hear a happy man. This is no paradise, he says, and by the way, he hasn't been on a surfboard in year. It's his wife who is the daring, life-loving part of the marriage - and it is she who falls into a coma after a boating accident. When the film begins, Matt's world is shattered and it will fall into even more pieces before he can try to pick up the shattered parts and move on. If there is such a thing.Following the surprise success of Sideways, Alexander Payne has taken on a successful novel and hired George Clooney as Matt. It has paid off: Clooney's bewildered face, helpless and searching and, after discovering his wife's secret, encased in an almost childlike anger, is often in close-up and carries the film. It is his eyes through which we see the world and discover the story and it is his state which dominates the films rhythm. When he is calm, the camera stays still, when he is in turmoil, it moves fast. This fascinating interaction between Clooney and the cinematography allows the viewer to experience the journey this character and his equally searching daughters are on. It is a journey of dead ends, of misunderstandings and pain, and ultimately, love. No false sentimentality here, just life, laconic, brutal, beautiful.Nobody exemplifies this journey more than Sid (Nick Krause). A stupidly grinning, annoyingly frank and simply obnoxiously happy teenage friend of Matt's oldest daughter, his presence on the journey is never fully explained. He is just there, suddenly, and remains. That's all there is to it and maybe that's life, too. Something happens, you don't know why and how but it's there. Sid is a sort of clown, infusing happiness where there should be none and denying the rule of rationality. As his presence cannot be rationally explained, he is the agent not of reason but of acceptance, acceptance of that which happens, whether it's good or bad, whether there seems to be a reason or not. What does is whether there is love and as long as this is so, all else can be overcome.And no, this is no paradise - or maybe it is. This Hawaii is beautiful, sublime and at the same time pedestrian, even sad. Sky and sea are mostly blue - with some grey patches - nature is green but there is always a slight mist over the scenery, the colors are a little pale as if this world is there but not quite. Matt moves, at least at first, like a sleepwalker through this life which is suddenly his own but which he cannot recognize. The misty images, the pale colors reflect this near-dreamlike state, this in-between status, this limbo he is in, a reflection of the real limbo of his wife.In a way, The Descendants is a growing-up story - not so much for the girls, but for Matt himself as he leaves the imagined life behind, makes peace with the real life hidden behind the facade - and with his still beloved wife - and starts out into a new one, reconnecting with his children, rebuilding the family, he the backup, the surrogate parent. Cautiously, insecurely, clumsily but honestly. Just like Sideways, The Descendants is a quiet, unassuming, complex and moving although totally unsentimental gem, about the big things: life, death, pain, love. Nothing less.http://stagescreen.wordpress.com/",The Descendants
236,zevt,Unsatisfying,7,20 May 2017,"I really liked Payne's previous movies and this one came very close to being another great, male-character-study, drama and light comedy. It's about a man who finds himself faced with a handful of life-changing crises all at once, all of them connected. His estranged wife is in a coma and may die, he suddenly finds himself forced to develop a relationship with his two difficult daughters, he discovers there has been an affair, and the paradise land he has been entrusted with has to be sold off to commercial interests.I liked most of it a lot, except for how the plot threads are tied up, most of them fading away or ending on very weak notes. Which means that this movie screams potential and is enjoyable for most of the time, then ends with a whimper.*big spoilers warning*His relationship with his daughters is the best thing in the movie, serving also the comedy and heart of the movie, with a quiet and satisfying ending.But the main plot thread about Matt is highly confused and petty. The reason for not selling the land is obviously not about saving it from commercial development like he pretends, but about getting revenge against the guy for sleeping with his wife so that he won't get the commissions. He makes a big deal about an ideal of keeping the land untainted, which never bothered him before until he found out the commissions would go to this guy. So he screws over a few dozen people just to get revenge on one. Turns out he is both petty and hypocritical. Somehow everyone seems to have missed this.His roller-coaster emotions about his wife and her affair are good for a while, but end very hollow with an unrealistically loving and forgiving speech after all that he found out about her, especially given his estrangement until then.Oh, and I found the Hawaiian elevator-music soundtrack annoying.And the secondary plot threads? Sid is an incredibly insensitive mildly amusing jerk at first, then suddenly stops being a jerk and tells a sob story. Hardly good character development there. Elizabeth's father blames everyone except his daughter and is horrible to everyone, except he cries for his daughter so we are supposed to feel sorry for him. Speer's wife has a good role with a complex ending when she comes to the hospital and her grand gesture turns into a rant. So her character does well. But, like I said, the main plot threads of the land and Matt's search to find the man who turned him into a cuckold both end on a really petty note. What a waste of a good movie.",The Descendants

I enjoyed this movie, though I didn't find it especially funny or witty as also labeled on the box and feel it was over-hyped as a picture-of-the-year nominee (from the ""celebrated"" director of ""Sideways"" of which I am not a fan). It feels like it is the middle act in a 3 act play: when the movie begins, his wife is already in a coma from a recent boating accident, his siblings and cousins (the ""descendants"") are 18 years in to a 30 year land agreement and he is acting as executor over a huge financial decision, he is estranged from his older daughter for unknown reasons, and he is left to deal with finally being a father to his youngest daughter. Some of these are resolved but without any climactic closure, and the film ends with others unresolved. I have no issue with open endings in movies to a point, but this felt like there was already a lack of build up and then it was just over. The acting was exceptional and the story was relatable, the Hawaiian scenery was gorgeous, but it was lacking in the cinematic ""oomph"" I was expecting. 6/10, rewatchability 3/10",The Descendants
239,zzyzx000-124-271558,What does it make you think about?,7,26 February 2012,"This review is for people who have already seen the flick.For me it was of interest because it was about people, and they were presented so we could see what they were all about. Knowing that George Clooney may get the Oscar tonight for best actor, I was watching him closely and missed what was so special about his acting. Doesn't the actor follow the direction of the script and the Director? I like George Clooney and he played his part. Is that what the Oscar is for; voting for your favorite actor? I liked all the actors in this movie; Sid, the daughter's take-along boyfriend, was an interesting character. So was Clooney's wife. Or should I give credit to the make-up artist? After all, she didn't have any spoken lines.So everybody was a good actor; what did they make me think about? Most of all, why would people talk out loud to a comatose woman; ie. a breathing corpse? Does that appeal to the religious? To me it's like talking to the sky (praying). What's the purpose? Nobody is listening.Next I wonder, why do people let a sex fling spoil their lives? Isn't that a religious thing as well? Some couples who are not so uptight attend sex clubs and swap partners. Some couples have their separate flings and then get back together. Why? Because they like each other's company.Some people 'cheat' because they are dissatisfied with their marriage but don't want the hassle of ending it. There are children to consider, estates to divide, moving to do. That, we are told, was Clooney's wife's situation before her accident. We are told he wasn't so thrilled with her any more either. So why didn't he find a good time gal occasionally, at least until the kids grew up? I don't know much about the history of marriage but I'll bet it has to do with the Church. Jealousy was invented before movies came along, but movies have not done anything in helping people realize that variety is the spice of life. A movie needs a conflict to make it watchable. There's plenty of conflicts in this soap opera. All of them unnecessary. Still it's a good movie. Not one gun fired and I don't recall anybody smoking either (although Sid did say he's always got weed).",The Descendants
240,italo505,"Great script, wonderful film",10,29 March 2012,"Once in a while it feels good to watch a good movie. Sometimes it's a relief not having to hear gunshots, loud soundtrack and explosions. Sometimes the explosions happen in the dialogue of a movie and it's so subtle, it becomes the essence of a movie. SPOILER ALERT: That's the case with The Descendants starring George Clooney as a Hawaiian man that discovers that his wife is in a coma after a high speed boat accident, leaving him in charge of their two daughters. At first he doesn't know what to do, it's as if he had been an outsider to the whole ""parent"" thing and he's been so consumed by work that he never thought that this may actually happen one day. He had left the parenting thing to his wife and he was now faced with the reality that he was in charge of raising his daughters in the event that his wife may or may not wake up from her comma state. You think is as simple as it sounds? Well, if you've ever been married with one teenage daughter who's a foulmouthed and disobedient, another 9 year old going on 19 and your comatose wife may or may not have been cheating on you then you would know what a life changing event that is. That's where the wonderful script comes into play. As far as the title is concern, I believe that the story is also about the bond that we as humans should have with both our ancestors and our descendants. Many of us are disconnected from our ancestors and vice versa. There's either little or no communication at all and no values are transferred from one generation to the next. In this society that we live in it's crucial to have moral values and that our life has mattered somehow, that we did the best we could to raise our kids. Just because you're older than your children this shouldn't devalue their worth and their individuality. Throughout The Descendants, Matt King (Clooney) learns quite a lot from his teenage daughter Alexandra (Shailene Woodley) that he never knew that he could, just like she learned from him as well. Together they form a bond that they may never have had if circumstances hadn't changed so drastically.",The Descendants

It Is About a Land Baron and a descendant of a very rich queen of Hawaii Matt(Clooney) who tries to take care of his daughters after his wife is in a coma because of a boat accident.The Movie starts showing Matt's Wife getting in a boat accident and Matt having to take care of his 10 year old daughter Scotty. Then it shows how Matt and his cousins are deciding and are keen on selling their land in Hawaii which is worth Millions of dollars. After realizing he cant take care of his stubborn Scotty alone, he decides to bring home his other 17 year old Daughter Alexandra home in order to help him restore peace in the house. After that it shows on how they live and bond together after not being close for many years due to Matt being so busy with all his work, and Matt and his kids also have fun with each other after a long time.George Clooney Gives one of the best performances of his life(at least of the movies I've seen of him) as a father who tries to take care of his daughters in a day to day basis which he has not done before,while also trying to keep himself intact after discovering that his wife was actually cheating on him and also trying to get over his wife's death. The rest of the crew also does a good job, specially Matt's two daughters Alexandra(Woodley) and Scotty(Amara). Also well done by the rest of the crew, specially Alex's friend sid and Matt's cousins. Very Well Directed by Alexander Payne, of whom before this i had only seen one movie, Payne does an excellent job in making these young actors perform so well, and also making Clooney give one of his best performances of his life. He also shows some nice comedy in the middle of this tough life of Matt, and also shows some breathtaking scenery throughout the movie.Good Cinematography in the movie, with some scenes of Hawaii in the movie being breathtaking. Very Well Written story also by the writer of the actual Novel,who shows us that we can also find happiness in our life while going through tough times. Good Background music throughout the movie,i think actual Hawaiin Songs were played throughout the movies. Finally, i think the movie is a very well made film by Payne, is quite enjoyable with some comedic scenes in it, and does deserve some awards.It will be tough this time to tell who wins the Best Picture awards in the Oscars with all these good movies releasing in the same year, although I think it will be this movie, the help or the Artist.",The Descendants
242,hdavis-29,Extraordinary film,10,18 January 2014,"This is a damn near perfect movie. I'm giving it a 10 to compensate for a couple of unreasonably low ratings I saw in other IMDb reviews. In reality, I'd give it a 9 and express my heartfelt admiration for a job well done by everybody involved. The writing, the acting, the direction, the casting, the photography. It was as close to a perfect film as I can imagine. I'd like to think of some minor quibbles just to dilute all this gushing, but I honestly can't. Maybe the flaws will eventually come to me (it's only been 12 hours since I saw the film). But for now I'm prepared to stick with this unabashed rave. What amazed me most were the little things: the nuanced performances, the underacting, the turns of phrase. It was just a skilled and confident job by all. It was smart and also emotionally savvy. I let myself stay open to the performances. I got hooked by the unexpected twists and turns of plot. I ended up liking characters I was initially repelled by. This is one of those rare films that both adults and kids (teens) can relate to. It never panders. There were literally some moments when I had to stop the film and walk away shaking my head in appreciation.Plainly, this film isn't going to appeal to everybody. Nothing does. But I'd really like to understand how anyone might write a negative review. You plainly won't hear one from me. If you enjoy it half as much as I did, you're going to have a hell of an experience.",The Descendants
243,FilmStallion,The Descendants...4 out of 4 Skittles,10,6 September 2012,"The Descendants thrusts us into the life of Matt King (George Clooney), a lawyer and inherited land baron living in Hawaii who must take over the care of his two young daughters after a boating accident leaves his wife in a coma. Matt, the so-called 'back up parent' struggles with his new solo parent duties as he deals with the forced sell of a large area of pristine and unspoiled land passed down to him from several family generations.Alexander Payne is a proved master in telling realistic human stories that showcase superb drama and subtle comedy that never seem to miss a beat as seen in his past films Sideways and About Schmidt. The Descendants is no different. The film has a way of making you laugh, then tear up within seconds.Clooney is a stand out as Matt King revealing hints of overwhelming sadness, but hiding it from his daughters (Woodley & Amara Miller). Woodley, best known for her role on TV's The Secret Life of the American Teenager is a revelation as the wild daughter sent away to private school for drugs. Amara Miller steals several scenes as the youngest daughter Scottie, who finds acting out and text bullying an over weight girl at school as the best way to deal with her mother's condition.Nick Krause, Robert Forster, Matthew Lillard, Beau Bridges & Judy Greer all deliver knock out punches in the tiniest spaces. The Descendants is pitch perfect and should find itself among the Best Picture race this coming Oscar season.For more quick reviews check out www.FilmStallion.com",The Descendants
244,bmennen,A movie that you do NOT want to end...,9,18 November 2011,"The director of this movie, Alexander Payne, was the guy who made ""Sideways."" This is a very different movie in that it focuses on family relationships rather than those between friends and lovers. But, Payne displays--in this touching and very real movie--the same incredible talent for doing two things better than almost every other movie maker (at least as far as I'm concerned): 1) he brings the viewer into the geography and milieu of the time and place in a gritty way that clearly presents the natural beauty of the area without over-romanticizing it and 2) he fits the characters into this environment and achieves a reality for these people that transcends the 2-dimensional characters that populate the multiplexes. You really care about these people.Another similarity between the characters in ""Sideways"" and this movie is that the protagonists are, in at least one important way, lost. They both are also honest with themselves.And thank God Payne did not use an orchestra for the soundtrack that would foreshadow and punctuate the scenes telling us how our emotions should run...I will not tell you what the soundtrack is, other than to say it's perfect.This is not a comedy though there are a few laugh lines. Clooney will get the Oscar for this...how can he not? He is in every scene, and I cannot imagine him being better. And Shailene Woodley plays his older daughter: just amazing. A beautifully realized character.I tried carefully here to give nothing away but to encourage you to see this as soon as you can. Brilliant.",The Descendants
245,postmortem-books,Great travelogue for Hawaii - but otherwise empty,5,16 February 2012,"I expected so much from this film considering the Bafta and Oscar nominations but, oh dear, this is an over-long and ultimately unresolved hiatus which dishonestly played to the emotions involved of a wife in a coma and a husband coming to terms with being the surviving parent of two wayward children. It seemed to me that after the initial teenage sulkiness from the older child that she quickly (within 24 hours) turned into a pretty helpful and accommodating adult - which, in my experience, is far from the truth. Five to ten years I'd say is the norm. SPOILER ALERT: Once we knew that the wife's lover was involved with the land deal I think only the dimmest viewer would be surprised by the final choice that King made on the sale of the Hawaiin land.Pretty pictures of Hawaii. Not so keen on Hawaiin music though - and there's a lot of it. And the Hawaiin shirts might give you a headache if you haven't dozed off beforehand.

246,randy_kay,only good quality,3,2 February 2014,"No one will probably ever read this but what the hell.This was a pretty weird film. It 'promotes' what I see around me which is the boomer generation acting like adolescents because they don't want to 'age' so they treat their kids like siblings instead of like children which is bad for everyone involved.It also shows the shallowness of our times, aging, entitled, dysfunctional boomers living the high life with inherited money they didn't earn, living like hobo kings in Hawaii, the 1st generation that was weaned on Television, the medium which so heavily exudes eternal youth, having to deal with aging and death and having to be the 'adults' when they've never been able to grow up themselves because of the influence of Television. And to prove my point, the very last scene is of Clooney and his two daughters staring straight at you because YOU are the television and THEY are the audience and they're watching March of the Penguins -- this is how they're dealing with the death of their mother -- by turning on the TV and tuning out! The only reason I can see this movie getting such high accolades is because I think our culture is SO desperate for direction on the issue of death and dying that it's grasping at even a shallow movies like this one out of desperation. The irony is that the alienation that's causing people to turn to movies like this one is the medium of television and movies themselves.The only redeeming quality of this film is that the George Clooney character decides not to sell off a huge chunk of Hawaiian land that's been in his family for a few generations so it doesn't get developed into a resort (yeah, dream on!). I doubt that would happen in real life but it does send a good message I suppose.",The Descendants

248,MennoMan,Typical Hollywood,5,26 January 2012,"WHAT I HATED: Hollywood releasing all the trailers portraying this as some sort of comedy or partial Comedy. Trailers showing George peeking over bushes as if spying on his wife and Running around with a silly running style as if chased by his relative. The only thing real about the trailers were they were clips from the film. This is Hollywood Greed at it's most obvious. What next, Hollywood telling congress how to run the country... oh wait... that's been done! Maybe they will threaten us and move to France..... oh yea... that was also done before I found my new lifestyle. Acting: George Clooney gives another good performance. Matt Lillard in a short SERIOUS ROLE... Congrates on breaking the stereotype. The actress playing his daughter and the actor playing the idiot boyfriend were quite good... maybe another movie would help me remember their names Film: The movie was not as bad as it could have been. There were no special or outstanding performances. Cinematography was less than good considering it was filmed in Hawaii... surprising the photography and view wer3e not a least good. Music, really I don't remember any this is bad for $$$; no OST it is good from the standpoint you don't remember how bad it was. Considering the subject matter of a dying wife who cheated on her husband with a scumbag, Her workaholic husband having to reconnect with his children while being the executor of a large Hawian estate is really hard to classify. The reconnection with his children was played well.... I can not recommend this to any Christian or especially Mennonite. As to my old non-religious friends.... maybe as a rainy day movie with no redeeming value.. you know, for when you don't feel like a good old movie.Clooney lovers may enjoy George. Those who remember Wing Commander and Scooby Doo may enjoy the short role by Lillard. Rated 5 for average HollywoodAnd that is my Mennonite Perspective....",The Descendants
249,WilderMovieReviews,It's a good movie for a quiet afternoon.,8,19 March 2012,"I wanted to see this mainly to see if George Clooney was truly deserving of the best actor nomination. I'm a fan of his but he usually always plays the same kind of characters, a flawed and/or ruthless person who has an experience and realises the error of his ways. And this is no different.George Clooney plays Matt King who along with his family owns a large piece of land on a Hawaiian island. His wife is in a boating accident and is left in a coma. Matt has to put his professional life on hold to take care of his two daughters. He also discovers his wife was seeing another man and wanted to leave him.This is a good film with every cast member, Shailene Woodley, Amara Miller, Beau Bridges, Matthew Lillard and Judy Greer, doing an excellent job. But it is the performance of Nick Krause as Sid who steals the scene every time he speaks. He adds a needed element of comedy in an otherwise serious film.So does George Clooney's performance deserve the Oscar nomination and the Golden Globe win? Having not yet watched all the nominated films I can't say. But he is great in this film. He is better than usual showing more emotion and vulnerability than he normally does. But it is the cast as a whole that makes this film work so well. Even though he is in pretty much every scene and it is his story, the cast brings this film to life and helps give his character added dimension.The film itself is one of those that doesn't really go anywhere. It tells the story that takes place over a few days well. There is no need for character development and no one really learns a life lesson. But the story is good and the characters realistic and interesting.This is a good film and I enjoyed watching it. It's a good movie for a quiet afternoon.",The Descendants
250,EephusPitch,Another of Alexander Payne's lost men,8,15 December 2011,"Alexander Payne is obviously drawn to material that features middle aged men who have lost their bearings: Schmidt, Jim McAllister, Miles and Jack, all are men who have lost sight of any meaning or direction in their lives. To that roster one may safely add the hero of this movie, real estate lawyer and descendant of Hawai'ian royalty Matt King. Matt has his head so far into his legal practice that his life has become unmoored; his wife, who has been reduced to a coma in a boating accident, has been having an affair with a prominent realtor, his ten year-old daughter has been bullying her schoolmates and generally throwing her weight around, his 17 year-old daughter has what might be described as an Elektra Complex, and, despite being sole trustee of his family's Kauai landholdings, he seems content to allow his gaggle of cousins to determine the fate of the paradisiacal property. When he berates his daughters for not respecting authority, it causes the biggest laugh of the entire film: there is no authority there.Fortunately for everyone involved, Matt is able, with the not inconsiderable help of his teen-aged daughter, to weather his crises, and emerges at the end as someone who will make a good father, and will be a steward for the land. George Clooney makes this transformation believable, and he is ably supported by the entire cast, and by Alexander Payne's direction; Payne always seems to summon solid performances from his entire casts.",The Descendants

The rumbles are delicately contained in the wonderful performances and perfect dialogue.Hawaii setting adds its own mystique and helps deliver an incredible film which has both mournful hilarity and comedic tragedy.Performances from all are of the highest order. George and Shailene Woodley though just blow their performances away. Incredible. But I also really love the skillful comedy Nick Krause brings in his character Sid. Touches like Sid in the film keep this from being weighed down by the subject matter.For me, this film could be shown in schools to show the intricacies and idiocies of life.Aloha to a perfect 10 out of 10 for me.

252,jwbeller,Felt no sympathy for or connection with anyone in the movie,7,20 November 2011,"I am a big fan of talented movie actors like George Clooney and was anxiously anticipating the opening of The Descendants which received universal acclaim by the critics (on Metacritic). In fact I saw it on the first day out in the Washington area at the Landmark Bethesda Row independent theater in Bethesda, Maryland. As usual, the average age of a nearly full theater was 60 or higher. This is the age group of a lot of the moviegoers that appreciate independent films. Unlike many of them, my wife and I, who are in the demographic, also appreciate a lot of films that appeal to wider audiences.The movie is very well acted and that is what received my generous vote. It is about a father and his two daughters who have to deal with a family tragedy and a not so secret family secret. The movie takes place in Hawaii where the scenery is a big plus. However, don't believe the hype that this will bring tears to your eyes in one moment and make you laugh out loud in the next. There are a number of comical moments, but there was noting in the movie that brought me to tears. Not even close, and there have been a number of movies that have brought a tear to my eye. Actually, I didn't feel any real connection with or any sadness for anyone in the movie. I can see that George Clooney may be nominated for an Oscar for his role in this movie, but that alone is not enough for me to recommend the movie to you. I understand this movie will be released everywhere on the day before Thanksgiving. It will be interesting to see if it is successful or will go the way of another recent George Clooney movie, The Men Who Stare at Goats. I will say the Decendants was much better that the goat movie.",The Descendants
253,marsanobill,Utterly forgettable In-Flight Fare,5,15 January 2012,"SPOILER ALERT (It's way at the bottom and MARKED). Clooney is stiff as a plank in this overlong, unsatisfactory drama. The first hint you get is the opening with heavy-handed narration. Narration is always a bad sign. The movie simply PLODS onward from that inauspicious beginning. While the movie does avoid the soap-opera aspects of the story, it betrays its only interesting character. Here's the SPOILER: I'm talking about Syd, the glib, prize-jackass boyfriend of the unstable/semi-druggie older daughter. The dope who thinks granny's Alzheimer's is funny. Everybody grows up a little in this story (except, I guess, the younger daughter, who's a cipher--just there for others to worry about) but the one who grows up most and most unexpectedly is Syd. So much so that in fact, in a late scene at the hospital, where Clooney is being unfairly jumped on, Syd is the FIRST to stand up for him. This character development creeps up on you because a) it's subtle and b) there ain't much else, but it's the stand-out of the film. Apart from that, the script MAKES him important: there's a protracted if unbelievable scene in which Clooney has a late-night 'what would you do in my shoes?' heart-to-heart talk with him alone. Yet after all that the script just dumps him. Not even dumps him--that would require some action of some sort. He's just completely omitted from the climactic scenes, as if he never existed. And so this is an utterly unmemorable movie. Six months from now even its fans will struggle to remember it.",The Descendants

This is such a fantastic movie, it brings touchy moments, but it also has a few humorous moments. George Clooney is truly fantastic taking the lead in the story about Matt King, a fathered man of two girls, who's wife has just entered a coma and then he found out that she was cheating on him and now he'll have to replace his rough relationship with his two daughters by a good one, George was perfect as that guy, his expressions and his voice, he definitely deserved his Oscar-Nomination and I have doubts if he should win it or not...Overall, The Descendants is completely worth it, it stands out at the BEST MOTION PICTURE NOMINEES, - Hugo, The Artist, The Help, The Tree of Life, Moneyball, THE DESCENDANTS, War Horse, Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close- and I think that if The Artist didn't win the Oscar, it would fall on Hugo's hands or on The Descendants' hands.

Every scene has been crafted with utmost care and attention. Character interaction is polished completely smooth so it slides gracefully along. So much has gone in to making this movie perfect that it becomes stifling. You feel like you've come to an art gallery rather than a cinema. Indeed, 'The Descendents' seems to exist to be admired rather than enjoyed. All the cast give flawless performances, although George Clooney (Matt King) appears overly preoccupied with bringing subtlety to his role. Shailene Woodley (Alexandra King) and Amara Miller (Scottie King) deserve the most praise playing the daughters as they deal with the illness then death of their mother and the consequences. Unfortunately Director/Screenwriter Alexander Payne forgets to inject any pace or good old fashioned fun. His previous efforts include the excellent 'Sideways', which managed to be enjoyably humorous as well as beautifully made. Humour in 'The Descendents' is low key and self consciously quirky. Film snobs will no doubt laugh loudly to show the rest of the audience how much they appreciate this. Interesting fact, Payne was a screenwriter for 'Jurassic Park 3'. A dinosaur or two here would certainly have improved my enjoyment as I sat there slipping into boredom. Sometimes in life a rough diamond is preferable to a flawless one.",The Descendants
257,pfogertyca,Top Notch Performances Amidst a Flawed Screenplay,7,27 December 2011,"George Clooney has never been better, Shailene Woodley displays poise and depth beyond her years, and I can't say enough about Robert Forster, Judy Greer, Nick Krause, and even the typically dorky Matthew Lillard.Thankfully, the terrific acting helps distract from an implausible plot that frequently goes so far off the map that it falls off the edge altogether.I found it difficult to believe that Woodley's out of control, bitter character would come around so quickly and easily. I didn't buy that Clooney would allow Woodley's dim-bulb boyfriend to tag along with the rest of the family on their journey. And I struggled to accept that the clan would go to such lengths just to make contact with mom's secret lover.Still, there are some utterly awesome acting moments, most of them so quiet, yet so powerful, that make this movie worth seeing - Robert Forster looking off in the distance, struggling to hold it together when he realizes he's going to lose his daughter; Nick Krause showing sadness and vulnerability with just a faint smile as he tells Clooney about his own father's passing; and Clooney's heart wrenching final goodbye to his wife as tears glide down his face.Payne got 120% from his actors in this production.

258,dalelawson-1,"Wishy-washy storyline, but entertaining enough",6,24 February 2012,"The Descendants (Dir. Alexander Payne, 2012) has received a lot of Oscar nominations, much like The Artist (Dir. Michel Hazanavicius, 2011). The most notable of these nominations is George Clooney for Best Actor, which is an undoubtedly a tough category this year. After watching The Descendants I have to say I am surprised at the success it has received, in awards and box office earnings.The acting in this film is fantastic and deserves recognition. The eldest daughter, Alexandra (Shailene Woodley), was one of the best actors in this film, providing a strong and capable female lead, unlike Amara Miller, who plays the younger daughter, Scottie. Both Scottie and Alexandra's best friend Sid (Nick Krause) are obnoxious characters who are seemingly only there for comical effect, and therefore they are not developed to the extent of Alexandra or Matt King (George Clooney) and unneeded in the plot. It has to be said that I have seen Clooney provide better performances than in The Descendants, like in O Brother, Where Art Thou? (Dir. Joel & Ethan Cohen, 2000).The story, from the very beginning, feels like a classic Clooney film, which by the end is sure to have had equilibrium restored. The underlying dilemma throughout The Descendants is how Matt King and his children will deal with his wives death. The majority of the plot, however, strongly focuses on the sale of a large portion of land on a remote island in Hawaii, which perhaps is meant to symbolise the family's troubles with losing their mother/child/wife. Hawaii is also a good setting due to its multiple islands, which might signify the separated King family at the beginning of the film.The soundtrack is also worth a quick mention, as it again feels like Clooney's soundtrack. The slow playing ukulele, I presume, which then picks up during any ""action"" scenes. This soundtrack feels very similar to that of Fantastic Mr. Fox (Dir. Wes Anderson, 2009), which featured the vocal talents of George Clooney. An upbeat, and Caribbean score like this does help draw you into the world of the Kings. I cannot personally say this film is worthy of any Oscars, due to its very wishy-washy narrative. In-depth analysis does perhaps make the choice of location, characters and plot a more complex and intelligent decision, but that alone cannot make a film great. I have heard that this film is made better with multiple viewings, but whether I will buy it on DVD, when released, is unclear.

I didn't hate it, nor did I love it.Its around 5~7 for me........For the first act... I thought it was ok-fine. Nothing crazy or exceptional but I was invested. And was looking forward to where the story goes.The Sid and scotty characters were kinda stupid actually. ESPECIALLY SID OMGThe Subplot with Speer was cool.The third act - I wasn't as emotionally moved or invested as other people. It wasn't terrible or anything but it was ""ok"" ""meh"".But there are elements of the movie that I appreciate.George Clooney was good in his role. This is the second time seeing him and he was pretty solid. Nothing exceptional or special but solid. (Kinda like this movie if you ask me. )The movie does not try to be over-the-top + its chill. And most of the times, I liked that choice.Some movies decide to be so over-the-top in order to make the audience cry or ""feel""... but in the process they become just cringe and lame.This movie doesn't have that except ONE scene in the third act.But, that choice could also work as a negative factor on some moments / to some people.The movie might feel boring and uneventful.And I did kinda feel that way about certain parts of the movie when I look back.In the End, I wasn't crazy bout this movie and thought it was alright.But, I do think it was some good moments, it is competently made, and overall is solid story.I actually do think I might be able to appreciate
this for what it is.Ps. Was that Morgan Freemans voice in the end.",The Descendants

Like Rory McIlroy when going in 4th round with the lead, it seems Payne is ending it by doing it effortless. And with a smile. Every actor is at his best in here. Robert Forster and Judy Greer, for the better. Even George Clooney, who's playing such a low profile character, is doing real fine. He's not the most gifted actor, but he's touching our heart quite well in this film. This a tragic story, but shot in a magnificent place. It is like listening to a great pop song with sad lyrics. Payne is again showing us a man who's life is collapsing without any doubt, but standing still. Like in ""About Schmidt"", ""Sideways"", ""Election"" and ""Citizen Ruth"" (a woman in this one). It's funny, but you don't laugh. It's sad, but you don't cry. Sometimes, life is just too hard to bear. You can't not like this film.",The Descendants
261,jacco59,"Solid drama, simple yet complicated",8,5 February 2012,"I have been a fan of Alexander Payne since About Schmidt, because I love the way he manages to keep things simple and clearly structured throughout. And this film is no exception. The story is pretty simple: Matt King is owner of a large parcel of Hawaiian land along with his family, as they are the distant descendants of the people who first came to that island and claimed it hundreds of years ago. But that's really just a part of the story. It's mainly about family struggle and mid-life crisis. King's wife suffered a boating accident in the fist few frames of the film and is in a coma throughout it. In her will it said she wanted King to live together with their two daughters Alexandra and Scottie. I won't reveal any more here, but I can say that all the actors, especially Clooney as Matt and Woodley as Alexandra, put in a great performance and their characters are all completely believable.

262,CaptMTS,The Descendants is an outstanding and touching drama,9,12 December 2011,"The Descendants is a tragic and heartfelt family drama set against a backdrop of the sights and sounds of modern Hawaii. The music is wonderful, and the scenery of several Hawaiian islands is amazing.George Clooney is outstanding as the father of a family torn apart by tragedy. His character deals with unsettling secrets of his dying wife and his broken relationships with his two troubled daughters. Forced to deal with the consequences of neglecting his family, Clooney does a great job capturing conflicting and powerful emotions.Shailone Woodley does a wonderful job as the rebellious older daughter, who captures the anger and hurt of a teenager betrayed by her mother and abandoned by her father. Her relationship with her father is the heart of the movie, and they slowly learn to rely on each other for support and strength in dealing with the loss of their mother/wife.The film has a wonderful supporting cast that adds humanity and heart to the tragic story. Nick Krause stands out as the oldest daughter's friend, who adds a touch of laughter and perspective to the film. His open and carefree personality grates on the characters initially but helps them to eventually gain perspective on the tragic events.Overall, the Descendants was an excellent movie that captures the raw emotions of a family dealing with betrayal, pain, and loss and learning to draw together for love and support.",The Descendants
263,Joe X.,A big ehh..,5,29 January 2012,"Alexander Payne's made a career out of casting a gimlet eye on the foibles of flawed middle class folks, and while he might have seemed a bit condescending toward them, you empathized with them or even loved them.Ironically, with Clooney's 1-percenter lead, Payne seems to have gone to great lengths to portray his most likable protagonist thus far, yet I feel nothing.Clooney spends the movie trying to resolve being cuckolded while he drags his two daughters and a stoner boyfriend along for the ride. Shouldn't he be helping his kids cope with their loss? Truth be told, they don't seem all that broken up about it. Nor does he, although he's obsessed with being cheated on. In fact the only person who registers what feels like appropriate grief is father-in-law Robert Forster. His performance stands out because of it.Clooney's character is remote. He can barely stand to hug his kids when they find out mom's doomed. When stoner boy reveals a horribly painful fact, Clooney's a wax dummy. And Clooney does not do sorrow well. So you have this melodramatic set-up about the most tragic of circumstances, and the lead actor plays it like a wooden Indian. I understand that was the point. It just didn't work is all. He's plenty invested in his personal tragedy, though. He gets most worked up in his therapeutic monologues with his comatose wife. As he goes through anger, repentance, and acceptance, we are supposed to think he has accomplished something. I didn't. Another character also exorcises demons over top the vegged-out wife. That poor woman. (Although, from what we hear about her in the script, she's not supposed to be very likable.) At the end, Clooney shows he has grown to the point where he can stand to sit on the same couch with his kids and eat ice cream. I can appreciate understatement and all, but it's not enough. Ask the younger one if she wants to go camping next week or something. Anything. I would be remiss without adding that the voice-over and on-the-nose expository dialogue in the first third of the film were also below Payne's usually high standards. I guess every director has a misfire eventually.",The Descendants
264,myc4971,heartwarming without being sappy,9,19 January 2012,"If you've watched Payne's About Schimdt, Sideways and Election, you wouldn't think he would be capable of doing a movie such as this. He seems to do mostly dark comedies which explores the darkness that's within us. After watching the trailer, I didn't really expect this film would be a complete departure from the three films I've mentioned. I loved ""Election"" so much, thought ""About Schimdt"" was okay and hated ""Sideways"" so much. So I really had very low expectations going into the movie but I must say I was so wrong.The Descendants just sneaked up on me and completely made me fall in love with it. The story is so much prone to being sappy but the screenplay was handled very much with care and Payne's conscious direction made it a heartwarming family drama.Matt King seems to have it all. He is a descendant of one of the Hawaii royal family. He has the money, a lovely family and an established practice. It took one accident to pull him out of the ""zen"" that he's used to. Then he had to face the real state that his life is in. He has two daughters he really doesn't know. A wife he had neglected. and a family legacy that he's very much willing to give away to make the whole clan happy.Matt King's journey to the way that he has lived his life was painful as it is breathtaking. It actually provokes you to think and reflect how we can sometimes easily lash out in anger and retreat to depression and resentment without acknowledging our own faults. Matt King comes full circle with a full understanding and accountability of how wrong he was all along leading him to letting go of all anger and to just take stock and just make a conscious decision to change the course of his life. I applaud the ending so much because it didn't try to be preach-y. It didn't try to be self-righteous. There was only redemption. We see Matt King going back to his roots with a renewed sense of accountability to those who came before him and to his family: his two daughters.George Clooney played Matt King to a perfect note. Every breath and every move actually evokes a strong emotion that's building and being restrained at the same time. He was the heart of the movie and he was able to carry it very well. Shailene Woodley and Judy Greer were also stand outs.The Descendants, in my opinion, will go down in movie history as one of the best family dramas --- it was honest, real, relatable and intelligent. For this, I must say I was wrong about Alexander Payne.",The Descendants
265,jjedif,Hawai'i ruling class,8,27 February 2012,"I am NOT among the people who think George Clooney was cheated at the Oscars for not winning the ""Best Actor"" award. In fact, I don't even think George Clooney is that good an actor in general nor do I like the topics of most of his movies. But I deal feel ""The Descendants"" is a worthwhile movie, including possible the ""Best Picture"" award because it does a good job of examining Hawaii's ruling colonist class without being too heavy handed about it.On the U.S. mainland, we almost never talk about the mixing of peoples nor do we seem to form stable mixed-race groups. Barack Obama, e.g., is ""black"" because in the U.S., if one of your parents is white and the other black, you are black to most white people, thus, if you want to have a life, you make that life in the black community where you are most likely to be acceptedand your whiteness is even an advantage. But on in most other parts of the world, the white colonists mixed with the non-whites to form mestizo (Native American + European) groups or mulatto (African + European) groups, and then when the whites left, the mestizos or the mulattoes simple took the place of the whites and the non-whites remained at the bottom. Guatemala and Haiti, respectively, are prime examples.So I have happy to see Clooney's film explore that aspect of Hawaiian mestizo culture (even if I don't buy the ending regarding the 25,000 acres of unspoiled Kauai paradise). And I would still love to visit Hawai'i somedayand I promiseI won't stay and try to muck up your paradise.",The Descendants

The script and the director do a good job of pacing this kind of movie. The trouble with this is it makes this story almost boring; at the least it's plodding. This movie is really a vehicle for Clooney. Unfortunately he is playing a role very similar to his character in Up in the Air; an emotionally detached person with suddenly too much on his plate. His performance is fair, but I found it lacking. His shell never really cracks and events of the magnitude he is going through should have cracked it, hard. The better performance is by Shailene Woodley. Her character shows a growth into maturity. Overall the story has too many loose ends and bits, the performances are nothing we haven't seen before, the direction is measured and stock. A 5 out of 10.",The Descendants

One must look a little more than sideways to see that the characters are dancing with the gorilla alcohol.

""what is it about all the women in my life who want to destroy themselves?""This drinking a love story begins with his wife whose extra marital affair just happened at a party during Superbowl Sunday. Also, her fatal boating accident while water skiing just happened.When George makes a surprise visit to tell his 16 year old daughter Alexandra of her mother's impending death, he finds her drunk and dancing under the moonlight on the golf course.Alexandra's boyfriend is not quite the overripe glamour boy of Sideways, but he has the same rebel like spirit setting up others to get angry. He later discloses that his father was killed by a drunk driver. Alexandra's younger sister tells her comatose mother that her sister has been drinking and is an alcoholic. She takes photos of her Mom who is in a coma and brings to school where her teachers criticize her? Why isn't this child honored for expressing her grief by sharing her art work?George's father in law blames him for his daughters death. The water skiing accident was George's fault because George was a workaholic and didn't buy his wife her own power boat?

268,TruthSpeaks,Overrated,4,3 December 2011,"This is a slow, boring movie about a middle-aged man with a wife in a coma. I can't fathom the rave reviews.I've spent a lot of time in Hawaii and know the types of people and places depicted here. I acknowledge that the filmmakers were far more sensitive and respectful of Hawaii than most. They tried hard to capture the true feeling of the place. The skipped a lot of disrespectful, lazy stuff that outsiders do when depicting Hawaii. That is to their credit. At the same time, the feeling isn't there. The movie often reads like an ad for high end real estate. There's something missing.This movie has been compared to Sideways, another movie from the same director. That is also about a middle-aged man. To my mind, Sideways was a better movie, more lively, more humorous and with more to say about life and human nature.If you want to see a recent movie that captures the feeling of Hawaii, Soul Surfer is one example. As far as books, I'd recommend, The Territory of Men by Joelle Fraser, and West of Then by Tara Bray Smith.

Then I watched it with my husband after the kids were in bed and he wasn't all that thrilled. His exact words were ""there wasn't anything better on?"" It's slow and it's a drama (definitely NOT a comedy which the TV said it was...). And that's not for everyone. I loved all the great shots of Hawaii and I felt like the acting was pretty good (even from ""Scottie"" who hasn't been in anything else...although she looks REALLY familiar). Anyway, the story was good and I liked how the two storyline came together. I really only laughed 2 or 3 times and they were just little 1) when the mom of the other girl says ""I forgot about the time Scottie told my daughter she didn't want to be her partner on the rock wall b/c she didn't want to fall into her butt-crack. That doesn't even make sense."" IDK why but that was just really funny to me. 2) When Sid get's punched in the face. And a 3rd time I can't remember...Otherwise it was actually pretty sad. You end up really hating the mom b/c she was a whore and the kids are so completely out of line it drove us nuts, but still. I can't imagine how my kids would react to something like that and it really makes you think about how one little accident can change your whole life (and everyone around you). I wasn't truly fond of the little girl and all the profanity/sexual stuff. I am definitely no prude (I love me some Judd Appatow so that should tell you something lol) but she was only 10 and they were using the f word every other word around her and talking about porn and boobs etc. IDK it just made me cringe a little bit.

After his wife suffers from the boat accident, he tries to overcome the pain and re-connect with his two daughters.As somebody correctly put it, this movie is the living evidence of how flawed the new concept of the Oscars is. Previously, each category had only 5 nominees, strictly, whereas now they include ""between 5 and 10"". This resulted in movies being nominated, which are clearly not up to speed with the rest of the nominees, and that only highlights their mediocrity. And yes, the Descendants is one of those movies.The Descendants is Alexander Payne's latest film since Sideways, based upon the novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings, and it already snatched a few awards, including Best Picture (Drama) at this year's Golden Globes, along with George Clooney being awarded the Best Actor (Drama) award. And it is nominated for the Oscars along with Hugo, Artist and Moneyball. And the question ""Why was it awarded?"" still stays in my head.The distinctive feature of the movie is that it tries to depict life as it is, so that the viewer should be more engaged with what is going on the screen, will associate him/herself easier with the main characters, and laugh at the simple everyday moments captured by the camera. I have to admit – they succeeded. I, personally, was associating myself with one of the main characters, but not with King or the older daughter's boyfriend, Sid. The whole movie I felt like the dying Elizabeth King, not able to move or regain consciousness, but forced to die slowly and painfully. The movie is annoying in the boredom it manages to inflict. It has clear start but no culmination or catharsis, or indeed anything to keep you alive. 115 minutes of the show felt like 515, endless show of people desperate to present us with drama and emotions, but failing at igniting the passion for the characters.I won't say the movie is bad. It has all the right components, very nice storyline, great performance by Clooney and Shailene Woodley as Alexandra King, fantastic director's work. But there is a very important component missing, something that helps to distinguish between just good and excellent movies; some kind of spark, something that makes you willing to watch it to the end because you are genuinely interested in what is going on. Without this, pretty good components mix together to form a very mediocre movie.And of course there were high expectations. I expect a very high level from all the Oscar nominees, and this film clearly does not live up to expectations. It is well below the benchmark set up by the main nominees of this year, and even some movies that were not nominated are better. And this high expectations problem is the final piece that turns just mediocre movie into something intolerably mediocre.I have to say a couple of words about the soundtrack. When I was faced with the boredom, I intuitively started to look for something entertaining, and I thought I found it: the soundtrack to the movie is light Hawaiian music. The problem is: you will listen to exactly the same song for the whole duration of the movie. 115 minutes of exactly the same song. By the end of the film I started to hate it.VERDICT: Mediocre movie, definitely well below the level of other Oscar nominees. WATCH: If you are Clooney or Payne fan.

It is so perfectly paced and scripted, the moments of emotional intensity and humor are so hypnotically drawn together, the performances are of such fine composure.

Most were all pretty pasty and pale too. I also felt that as bohemian as Beau Bridges looked, why didn't he speak a little pidgin English.

281,Emma_Stewart,"Charming, clever and often rather touching",7,14 April 2013,"Alexander Payne's long-awaited The Descendants is a touching portrait of relationships and the obstacles in their way, how difficult it can be to connect with those closest to us, the fear of conveying emotion, how others act as mirrors for us to understand and express ourselves.The Descendants begins with an unfortunately long voice-over from our protagonist, Matt King (George Clooney). His wife, Elizabeth, has suffered head trauma and is hospitalized with a coma. Matt is dealt blow after blow when he learns that she was cheating on him up until her accident. He gathers his daughters (Amara Miller and Shailene Woodley) and sets out on a literal and emotional journey to inform their friends of Elizabeth's condition and to track down her partner.Alexander Payne's directorial style is present here in his reliance on narration and awkwardly funny, ""am I allowed to laugh?"" tone. Unfortunately, the story and the characters are so personal, it's as if Payne gets in the way at times. His attempts to make The Descendants more authentically Hawaiian, notably through the use of indigenous music, feel gimmicky rather than natural and jolt the audience out of what is otherwise a thoroughly engrossing and gripping journey. Payne has a habit of using narration to great effect, but here it's unnecessary and uninteresting: in spite of a couple witty one-liners, most of the narration (done by Clooney's character) is redundant and out of character. All we need to know is already in the film, rendering the opening monologue especially useless, and while Matt is portrayed as private and emotionally distant, we are constantly interrupted with his life story. Clooney may have the perfect voice for narration but even that isn't enough to cover up its obtrusiveness.Apart from Payne's sometimes intrusive direction, though, it's a great film, one that's helped by an outstanding screenplay and incredibly natural performances. The editing leaves something to be desired, as The Descendants takes much too long to set everything up and many scenes feel awkward and irrelevant; however, the writing is strong enough to keep an audience interested. The success of the film depends on whether the family at the film's core is convincingly loving, yet grating and distant, and on that front, the film excels - the characters are wonderfully written, and we get a strong sense of their histories, idiosyncrasies, and dynamic. Payne and his co-writers find the humor in confrontation: his characters are at their worst, but funniest, when fighting. It takes a talented writer to create comedy from earnestness, and the Oscar buzz for The Descendants' screenplay is well-deserved.In a movie that focuses so intently on just a few characters and not much plot, a lot of pressure is put on the actors. Clooney and Woodley in particular exceed expectations, both bringing so much depth to their respective characters and playing off each other to create a hilarious, but raw, emotional, and above all realistic father-daughter relationship. Clooney is at his best here, doing a wonderful job of expressing a deeply internal conflict: he creates an aura of emotional distance, but quietly makes it clear that he is struggling to remain composed in the face of so many emotional blows. His performance is extraordinarily nuanced, and he brings so much meaning and significance to something as trivial as a hand motion, or a quick glance. Clooney is meticulous and powerful, letting the tiniest change in body language signal a huge emotional shift.Shailene Woodley, however, is the star of the film. Her performance here (which, by the way, is sure to attract major awards attention) is wildly different from the tragedy that is The Secret Life of the American Teenager, but under a director of Payne's caliber she shows huge promise. Clooney's performance is undoubtedly one of his best, but his Matt is so restrained and aloof - the emotional power of certain scenes might not have been expressed if Woodley wasn't there to do it. She delivers pure, raw, unadulterated feeling, and does it so naturally and intuitively. Alexandra is spelled out in the screenplay as potty- mouthed, irreverent, and carefree, but Woodley defines her so much more distinctly, more definitively. She fleshes her out into a full person, and therefore contributes so much to the family dynamic that is the center of the film. It may be Payne's first, however small, directorial misfire, but The Descendants nevertheless is a charming, moving, often hilarious film firmly built on a fantastic screenplay and actors who fully inhabit their roles. We learn, grow, laugh, and cry with them as they travel the distance not only between islands, as they search for friends and enemies (look for a heartbreaking cameo from Judy Greer), but the distance between each other as well. Payne's direction gets in the way sometimes, but The Descendants is a journey worth taking.",The Descendants
282,HerrDoktorMabuse,Fundamental Things Apply,9,11 December 2011,"This is a conservative movie from the philosophical point of view. Absolutely nothing to do with crude Punch and Judy politics, but a rich, satisfying meditation on what we owe to posterity, that at any moment we live at a pivotal point between the future and the past and struggle to do right by both. The film constantly contrasts inadequacy, shallowness, and shortsightedness against grandeur, depth, and eternity, very often in the struggles of individual characters. The George Clooney character, while probably the most self-aware of the bunch, realizes what little he knows about important things in his life, including his daughters, wife, extended family, his role as a man, and the fate of Hawaii itself. We see the eldest daughter's perfectly natural adolescent shallowness smash against the rocks of mortality and adulthood.It may also be the only movie I've ever seen with fully realized characters who are living, dead, and in-between. But after awhile, we understand that the comatose wife's lack of situational awareness is only slightly deeper than anyone else's in the movie.The brilliance of this movie is that very little of this is explicitly sign-posted and we must make the inferences ourselves only from what we see on the screen. Payne recognizes the images are just that--a surface that an audience must dive beneath. Yes, he speaks to us with filmic language, but after that we are on our own.I withheld a tenth star as there were moments when I was aware that it was George Clooney up there on the screen, and I am a little uncomfortable with movies that get too heavy with the lesson plan. That's not what movies are really there to do. This one largely succeeds, but would you rather take 90 minutes from your life to watch ""Stagecoach"" or something as hideously didactic as ""Inherit the Wind?""Less profoundly, I think this movie has the potential to do for Hawaiian music that ""Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?"" did for pre-Nashville country music. I'm keeping my eye out for the soundtrack album.",The Descendants
283,aschein81,Terrific acting from cast disguises paper thin soap opera story and overbearing musical score,6,26 November 2011,"Pros: Acting performances all around, especially from George Clooney and Shailene Woodley as Clooney's 18 year old daughter. Clooney pretty much carries the movie by his acting alone, even when nothing of significance is ever going on. Also, the key characters are given a significant amount of depth, so no one really feels like a caricature, except for Sid (Woodley's boyfriend), who was basically written into the movie for a few quick laughs. Cinematography is also solid, as one would expect in a movie filmed in Hawaii. It never takes center stage - and is always a supporting role in the film, as cinematography and visuals should be.Cons: The musical score, with its soft, Hawaiian, plucking guitar strings, is used far too often during the film - as if director Alexander Payne is begging for the audience to cry and care at certain moments. There are also too many instances of tears flowing from characters' faces (mostly Woodley's), as if the film is trying to direct the audience on when they themselves are supposed to tear up. It just feels too manipulative in these moments, as if this is a Lifetime movie or Dr. Phil episode, instead of just letting emotions and truth appear naturally. Also, the film feels way, way longer than it needs to be. This is essentially an 80 minute story stretched out to a bloated 120 minutes. It literally takes 30-40 minutes in the middle part of the film for Clooney and his daughters to track someone down, when that should have taken 5-10 minutes of screen time. Some parts in the 2nd half are plodding and slow, until we have the formulaic tearjerker finale.Strong acting performances aside, I expected more from this movie's script, given the fact that I loved Election, About Schmidt, and Sideways. This feels more like an unfinished draft, with too much music and beautiful, lush beaches added in to fill in the void of a tighter, more compelling story. All in all, it feels more like a Lifetime or Hallmark station holiday movie, rather than a memorable piece of storytelling. I have a feeling this film will resonate more with female audiences, as this type of chick flick ""affairs and backstabbing drama"" seems more up their kind of alley. Maybe this is part of Clooney's marketing strategy now when he releases a movie? I noticed the same type of ""chick flick"" focus in much of the plot in ""Ides of March"" a month ago. I think the studios know that Clooney brings in the female audience, especially the coveted female audience over 40 years of age, so maybe they are now targeting his movies towards them? I sure hope not. I'm a male and I thought ""Up in the Air"" and ""Michael Clayton"" were brilliant, but these last 2 have really underwhelmed me.",The Descendants

Alexander Payne has surely become a voice to be reckoned with, and each new film of his brings about a new layer of complexity to his work. George Clooney manages to show us that he indeed a good actor when in his element and both Shailene Woodley and Amara Miller are exceptional as his daughters.

285,fellow456,Good If Not Extraordinary,8,10 March 2013,"Pros: Let's be honest for a moment. You come to this movie for George Clooney, and if we're going to keep being honest, he's certainly worth the price of admission, suiting his best actor nomination nicely. But what may be surprising to some of you is the fact that his co-star, Shailene Woodley, does her part to keep pace with the much higher pedigreed Clooney. While other characters provide welcome comic relief and dramatic foils, Clooney's Matt and Woodley's Alex give the film a very human element with whom the viewer can't help but identify. Who would have thought we would be saying that about the first Batman with nipples (part of me feels bad for planting that thought in your head... but only part) and a chick most known for starring in modern teen soap operas?Aiding in the effort to get the viewers emotionally invested is a very deep immersion in the Hawaiian setting with the film's characters. From the stunning visuals to the quaint musical soundtrack to the constant bare feet, the movie brings the feel of Hawaii into the theater (well, I'm assuming this, since I've admittedly never actually been to Hawaii). In the end, you're left feeling as though you have actually experienced the events of the movie side by side with Matt and Alex.Cons: I know I just talked about how easy it is to identify with the main characters, but it's actually a little difficult to identify with a lawyer trust fund baby who lives in a tropical paradise and struggles with anything. *Coughfirstworldproblemscough*. Okay, so it's not quite so superficial as that, but you do still have to kick yourself every time you're reminded of the fact that, really, these people have it alright. Well, I didn't actually need to do any kicking of myself, because I was so busy enjoying the movie, but hopefully I just planted that thought into your head.Overall: Despite the plot revolving around a topic that traditionally makes me pretty uncomfortable, it's all actually a funny and enjoyable movie. The script made me breeze through the whole viewing, eagerly waiting to see what would happen to ""us"" next. On the other hand, while it is a fun to watch little movie, it isn't really all that special. Nothing about it stands out to me, and I'm pretty sure in five years I'll mostly just remember it for being nominated for best picture. But after gazing into Clooney's dark and stormy eyes, I can't help but give the movie an 8 out of 10.",The Descendants

The Descendants , directed by Alexander Payne, is a Cloonie Express that transports you to a world you can't envision. Cloonie's feats are legendary by now. In The Descendants, he goes a step further. The Descendants in The Descendants not only follows orders of their creator, but also cook, fight, romance and wonder of wonders, have lengthy conversations with a mosquito and scan loads of books/magazines and an entire telephone directory in a second. Yes, you read it right! Only thing, Payne could've controlled the length of the film. It could've been shorter by at least 3 to 4 minutes, which includes doing away with a song or two. Of course, like all Alexander Payne movies, the songs are filmed most imaginatively on exotic locales, but what's the point of having songs if they act as speed breakers? That Alexander Payne ranks amongst Hollywood's best directors is well known by now and The Descendants only cements the fact. His vision and execution of the difficult subject deserves the highest praise, in fact distinction marks. He not only dreams big, but the outcome is incredible too. A. Rahman's music doesn't compliment the content of the film, but like I pointed out earlier, every song has been filmed exquisitely. The action and chase sequences are outstanding Yuen Woo Ping, action choreographer in the MATRIX and KILL BILL sequels, was the stunt coordinator. Visual effects are spectacular Stan Winston Studio, the studio behind JURASSIC PARK, PREDATOR, TERMINATOR, IRON MAN, AVATAR, provided the animatronics technology. Cinematography captures the grand production values with precision. The locations of Austria, Machu Picchu in Peru, U.S.A. and Brazil only enhance the visual appeal of the film. The sets are mind-blowing. Dubbing is near-perfect.On the whole, The Descendants is a crowd-pleasing and hugely mass appealing tale of android revolution with a thrilling plot, rich and imaginative screenplay, super action, astounding effects and most importantly, Clooniet, who is the soul of the film. It's the Big Daddy of all entertainers. Miss it at your own risk!",The Descendants
287,f-27753,The contrast of contents and the environment is unique,8,25 July 2016,"It is such a warm touching story that you can appreciate the importance of your family. A family is living in Hawai but is in an unstable circumstance. A mother is barely escaped from the accident but is about to be dead, and as for their children, they are defiant and rebellious to their parents. A father is desperate to fix it up in order to build a healthy family again. I think it is clever that the the story is set in Hawai. Unlike the uneasy mood in the story caused by the complicated family struggle, the environment where they live is extremely peaceful and tranquil. It is able to curve the tense of the family. Mild weather, beautiful sea and easy-going sub-characters effectively contribute to make the audience soothed. Moreover, it is splendid that the family are repairing their relationship little by little in response to the death of a mother. Even though death is a negative aspect in the story, you can consider it as something that can bring them together. To sum up, it is a serious topic to carry out, but you can accept them with the soft mood in Hawai.",The Descendants
288,Spring15,A remarkable movie and a pleasant surprise,9,26 December 2011,"This movie was not at the top of my 'to see' list but when I saw it got many nods from critics, I decided to go see it. I expected to see 'too much George Clooney', and yes, there he was in nearly every scene, but he portrayed the character so well! The elder daughter (played by Woodley) nearly stole the show with her acting.The movie starts with a woman enjoying a boat ride, and the next thing is she is in a coma, with her husband (Clooney) narrating the story. From that point on, we learn more about the family, the inheritance, the daughters he must bring up, and dealing with the secret revealed by his elder daughter about her mother, which is devastating. Clooney has done a marvelous job of showing all the mixed emotions- anger, rage, pain, sadness, confusion, helplessness, and the underlying love in subtle ways. The director has done a splendid job of mixing humor with the underlying tragedy that is at the base of the movie. The Hawaiian scenes are gorgeous, as expected. This is a movie about the challenges of life- we all have different ones- and some people, like Matt King (Clooney) find a way to overcome them. The changes in the daughters are remarkable too, as the movie goes along. There are many touching scenes but they never become melodramatic. The movie unfolds at a leisurely pace, and it quietly ends in a family room.This is not a movie if you are seeking sci-fi/special effects type entertainment (and I do enjoy those too), but if you want something about everyday characters and life, and want to laugh while some serious material, this may be the movie for you. I must admit that it was way beyond my expectations- I never expected it to be this good-, and I am glad that I did not read the story before seeing it.I was totally engrossed in the movie from beginning to end and I came out feeling totally satisfied that I saw an excellent movie.",The Descendants
289,msmith5484,Well written script and strong performance stays away from melodrama.,8,24 January 2012,"Many films show us characters working their way through grief. In ""The Descendants"" Matt King (George Clooney) has to tell his family and friends that his wife Elizabeth will be taken off life support after suffering a head injury. His eldest daughter tells him that her mother has been having an affair, he learns that she was in love with the man, Brian Speer (Matthew Lillard) and was going to seek a divorce. After breaking the news to loved ones that those who loved Elizabeth should visit her to say goodbye, he decides to find Brian and allow him to see Elizabeth.Alexander Payne's direction and George Clooney's understated performance anchors this film from becoming a study in familial dysfunction and morose introspection. There is anger and disappointment, from all, but it is conveyed realistically without hysterics and punches, as when Elizabeth's father (Robert Forester) blames Matt for his daughter's accident, or when Matt's daughters realize their mother is going to die, or Matt confronts Brian or says goodbye to Elizabeth, it is very grounded in reality. I never felt I was watching someone act.",The Descendants
290,RJGodin2,disappointing,3,7 January 2012,"This movie was characterized as a ""comedy"" but there was very little funny or even amusing about it. Even the minor comic relief of the Surfer Sid character is undermined by a late late tete-a-tete that reveals he has tragedy in is recent family history as well.There is very little to establish a real connection with any of the characters. As the rich real estate lawyer, Clooney gets plenty of screen time in close up emoting mode. Sure, he is in a terrible, tragic point in his life. But so what? What makes me connect? All the other characters seem to be props or foils for the lawyer King's reaction shots.The location is beautiful but ultimately becomes a travelogue background. For example, why go to the Big Island? I guess to show the white rock graffiti on the basalt fields.Same with Kauai. Besides using the Hanalei beach house for background and the sweeping view of the valley, not much value in moving the story forward.With no establishment of the marriage conditions pre-accident, King comes across as a totally engaged, totally bereaved husband and father. Where is the tension?",The Descendants
291,fldelk-1,Doesn't Fit Usual Cliché Plots,9,1 January 2012,"Like to book on which it was based, this movie does'nt follow the usual plot lines. Adventure movie fans would say it's about nothing, but it really sucks you in. Clooney is, as many other reviewers have said, excellent. It's amazing how much he can convey in even small facial gestures.I read the book before I saw the movie. The movie does simplify and telegraph the plot somewhat compared to the book and alters the focus away from the family to the larger land sale arc. However, it did seem to be a good dramatization. The movie - including the sets that were very nice but cluttered - kept the book's picture of real people - married people who shout at each other, children who screw up.One disappointment was the band at Cousin Hugh's bar. In the book, the ukulele club - old men - meet at the bar to play. In the movie, it just looks like an ordinary house band in a small club.Spoiler Alert- In the movie, Matt's wife has actively campaigned with his cousins for the bid that would enrich her lover. This wasn't in the movie. Actually, she's not that nice a lady in the book, before that. I sort of like the way the book ended, with Scotty saying her mother was under her fingernails, referring to her ashes, and her father drawing a lesson from that. I guess it was too outre even for this movie.",The Descendants
292,wfairfan,Family dysfunction healed under pressure - in Paradise,8,30 July 2018,"Matt (Clooney)'s a wealthy, hardworking, but out-of-touch with his family's 'feelings' and 'challenges,' Dad has to suddenly wake up and reassemble his life when his thrill-seeking wife suffers a traumatic head injury; her ultimate recovery uncertain. His teen and pre-teen daughters are almost unfamiliar, though not hostile, to him, and he must find a way to connect in this crisis. All this is set in both the bustling urban and unspoiled Hawaii - and to further complicate matters, As executor of an estate including a huge and gorgeous swath of virgin Hawaiian seashore granted to his great great great grandparents by the King, from whom his family is descended, Matt has an imminent deadline to reluctantly sell the property to developers. Oh, he also finds his wife hid secrets that suddenly arise, as well. 
 Clooney is well-suited to this role. He's charming, noble, ethical, a bit in denial and has some issues with empathy and affection, but is a good guy we can all admire and with whom we can sympathize. To me, a standout in a supporting role, was young Nick Krause, who plays a 'surfer dude-type' friend of Matt's teenage daughter, alternately riling the adults and offering gems of authentic teen wisdom and support that oft times steal scenes from the other cast members. He was a joy. 
 While I appreciate the nod to Hawaiian heritage and the references to island history and culture, I do wish the Hawaiian music, which plays almost continuously, would have been less ubiquitous. It becomes distracting at times. 
 A great film all-around. Worth a look. I bought the dvd and love it more each viewing.",The Descendants
293,Mihaela_Lacramioara,George Clooney always comes through,10,24 April 2012,"I have yet to see a George Clooney movie that I didn't love. Even if the movie has a questionable story line he will make the movie good.Set in beautiful Hawaii, this movie will make you laugh and maybe make you cry.This movie was full of emotion and we got to see George Clooney play a character we typically don't see. He shows a very vulnerable side and is on point the whole time.The daughters (co-stars) did a fantastic job as well.The entire cast deals with death, betrayal, sadness, and happiness and kept me convinced all along.My favorite was the tag-along kid. The most inappropriate, yet hilarious character :) You have to see this one!",The Descendants
294,OneMovieLover,"A triumph in cinema, beautiful and amazing",9,16 March 2012,"""The Descendants"" is as much of an Alexander Payne experiment as it is a great film. Of course, the audience can notice some of Payne's trademarks: irony, themes of infidelity, heavy voice-over in the beginning, and, of course, satirical depictions of contemporary American society, like social disconnection and the effect of sexual excess on morality. What's so unbelievable is that this film is about an unstable man attempting to raise an unstable family in the midst of unstable situations, yet it still manages to feel so real and authentic.First of all, there is much more musical background than Payne's other films. It may very well be the first mainstream American film to use an exclusively Hawaiian soundtrack, and every song goes well with every scene that it's used in, whether they may include Hawaiian chants or slack-key guitars.Next is the variety of fine acting performances. Clooney has seldom been better. Probably at an incredibly close second place is Shailene Woodley's breakout performance as Matt King (Clooney)'s daughter, Alexandra. There are even supporting characters that are convincing, such as the actors of Brian Speer and Sid.The first third of ""The Descendants"" is mainly introductory. However, it ends with a part where Matt King is yelling at his wife, which seems unrealistic, considering she's comatose. Even if she did cheat on him, the raising voice can be unnecessary. However, that's just an example of the outstanding character development that Clooney's acting assists with: King is a difficult man not to like, no matter how unfortunately unapologetic he may be towards some people.With the second half being one of the greatest modern parts of a film in recent memory, it is much better than the first half and carries more emotion, with originality, drama, and dark comedy. With a double-ending, ""The Descendants"" has a both happy and sad end to it.Overall, it captures the ups-and-downs of life, and while it could contain more Hawaiian culture besides scenery and clothing, ""The Descendants"" is still an excellent film.",The Descendants
295,fatherchristmas89,Enjoyable and not too heavy,8,1 January 2015,"This film is enjoyable but not too heavy regarding the subject matter. It is easily followed in one viewing and doesn't require a second viewing. It is a great film that deals, not with the wife in the coma, or necessarily the grief, but the implications of this to her family. The wife, of the Matt King (George Clooney's character) is involved with a motorboat accident and is in a coma. Her family is told that she will never recover so Matt embarks on a journey to tell his eldest daughter they are letting her mother go. The eldest daughter is rebellious and dislikes her mother, as she knows of her mother's affair with another man. Matt decides that if her mother loved this other man, and he loved her, he should be able to say goodbye. The film questions the conflict between the daughter's hatred of her mother and forgiveness and forgiveness of the mother's affair and letting her lover say goodbye. Great film, but not as deep as is could be.",The Descendants
296,jadafitz,Enjoyed thoroughly,8,9 August 2020,"I loved Sideways. Same screenwriter and director. George Clooney isn't my favorite actor, but this is one of my favorite performances from him.

297,kwingate,Easy on the eyes but numbing to the mind,5,16 December 2012,"This is one of those movies you almost feel guilty for not liking, especially the music. The scenery was beautiful, but then of course, we're talking about Hawaii. The soundtrack is presumably influenced by indigenous musical styles and in my fairly eclectic musical tastes I should have found a spot for it, but I would not volunteer to listen to it again, with or without the movie. The plot seemed to take a really long time to get any where (of course, they're not on mainland time, right?), then wrapped up all of a sudden as if they'd run out of film. The acting seemed flat, despite having liked most of the better known actors in other roles. I've seen other movies where I didn't really find a likable character (e.g. Rachel Getting Married) but ended up liking the film anyway -- not this one. I just couldn't warm up to this one at all.I've never been to Hawaii (yet!) and don't hang out with many 8-figure income folks, so maybe that's why I couldn't relate. Maybe next life.",The Descendants
298,Greigx3,typically Payne-ful but forgettable,7,3 February 2012,"Alexander Payne, best known for his low-key life-crisis films Sideways  and About Schmidt, stays in his comfort zone with this film but opts  for a slightly more family-friendly style.  The Descendants follows the story of a middle-aged Hawaiian lawyer Matt  (George Clooney) whose wife has been knocked into a coma and will  eventually die. As he struggles to bring his somewhat dysfunctional  family together to deal with her impending death, he finds out his wife  was cheating on him. The backdrop to this is an on-going legal process  in which his wider family are trying to agree on whether to sell a  sizeable and beautiful piece of Hawaiian land inherited from royal  ancestry.  This film delivers a sentimental human drama whilst avoiding clichés.  The trailer and opening sequence states this as the premise: ""my  friends think that just because we live in Hawaii, we live in paradise.  Are they insane? How can they possibly think our families are less  screwed-up, our heartaches less painful?"" etc. The picture does seem a  little too sugar coated though. Its saccharine idealism overpowers the  raw edge and potency which typifies Payne's earlier films, such as  Election.  I get the feeling that even though I can relate to the characters on an  emotional level, there's still an irreconcilable gulf between me and  the Hawaiian upper-classes on a material level. I subconsciously  dismiss the film as self-contained escapist cinema, making it as  forgettable as it is enjoyable. It's one of those films where you feel  like you've really enjoyed the experience, but can't remember much of  it afterwards.  It still retains Payne's unique essence, however. His originality,  off-beat humour, lovably flawed characters, understated action and  witty dialogue. The story world is very rich, but delivered in an  easily digestible plot. Seeing the seemingly emotionally inarticulate  protagonist deal with the complex social pressures bearing down on him  is sometimes hilarious, sometimes heartbreaking, but always  entertaining. While not as cutting as some of his earlier films The  Descendants adds another refreshingly frank and plausible feature to  Payne's consistently commendable filmography.",The Descendants
299,donbanf,Not what it seems?,6,4 August 2012,"Just watched this a couple nights ago with a friend. Did not know much about it other than the advertisements from when it first came out and had heard it was a good movie. But that's where things went wrong for me. Maybe it's me but the advertising made me think this was a sort of broad quirky comedy about a frustrated dad and it looked very funny. It's not a bad film--it has a few comedic moments (very few) but really is a drama and a long slow moving one at that. In addition, it borders on downright depressing. There are so many ""buttons"" here that get pressed--infidelity, mortality, estranged families, loss of long held valued possessions, environmental issues. What saved it for me mostly was I thought George Clooney did an impressive performance as a man struggling to come to terms with an event in his life and the strained relationship he has with his older daughter. I agree with another reviewer here that the movie gives you the sense of building up to some larger revelation that never comes. It's just different overall than what one might expect as I said. But I also very much enjoyed the scenery as I love Hawaii and this was filmed on both Oahu and Kauai and I recognized many places in the film. Some really gorgeous shots. Beware though, there is a lot of swearing and cynicism in this film and is not for kids, nor if you're looking for an evening of comedy.",The Descendants
300,jinchelsea,A major disappointment from a great director and a great actor,6,27 November 2011,"The buzz about this film has been Oscar-worthy, but the actual film is a major disappointment, particularly because it was co-written and directed by Alexander Payne, whose earlier films include the brilliant SIDEWAYS and ELECTION, and whose 7-year absence from film has been deeply felt.THE DESCENDANTS feels more like Payne's ABOUT SCHMIDT, which gave Jack Nicholson a good late-career role but was still just another road movie. This film feels underwritten and too often predictable. There is little doubt where we are going, but Payne's journey to get us there is too often uncertain in tone. Scenes and incidents, some funny, others sad, are set up, and then don't pay off.Clooney gives a good, understated performance, but his character's changes, from selfish, stingy, uncaring father and husband, to loving, concerned dad and human being, are never dramatized; we're just supposed to accept it. The whole cast is good, even Nick Krause in the Keanu Reeves role from ""Parenthood"" (the scene where the dopey teen gives advice to Clooney about his daughter is the same as Reeves giving advice to Dianne Wiest in the earlier film).Some times it feels as though the film were too heavily edited, and the missing scenes would have answered all our questions and satisfied our emotional needs. Perhaps reality TV has inured us to ""real"" drama, and Payne is simply reflecting an audience's inability to respond to a non-reality dramedy. Just hypothetical, but how else to explain the ultimate emptiness of an ""important"" film that just doesn't deliver?",The Descendants

On top of that, he has to make decision about the family land in Hawaii as the sole trustee makes him even more vulnerable.

302,Mountain-Storm,Grossly over-ratted,2,16 June 2012,"I am struggling to understand why this has such a high rating. Beautiful scenery filmed in Hawaiian time can't make up for a dull storyline with shallow acting by the leading star. My partner cries at the drop of a hat, but this flick didn't move her at all. At no time were we able to empathize with the characters other than a few moments with the young daughter who acted the best out of a bad bunch. And what was the deal with the hanger-on boy, that had no relevance to the story. The side plot of the land sale was so weakly implemented, it had no depth or audience investment at all. Even the scene where the dying woman's father was at her bedside wasn't that good. There are so many better movies of this ilk it's not funny. What a shocker.",The Descendants

Not that this movie didn't keep my attention, but I'd rather spend my 2 hours in the movie seeing something that kept my interest. Moneyball. Ides of March. So my review here is that you only go to this movie if you want escapist entertainment -- that is, escape right back into your very own miserable existence.As to the movie itself, I think it is a more realistic portrayal of a real world situation with a loved one on life support -- not like all the happy nonsense you see on the ""Today"" show where everybody is so happy that a parent has Alzheimers and the medical bills are eating up the estate.

I'm sure it differentiates a bit from man to man, but for me the great movies are not only the ones that feature talented casts, nice storytelling, and solid scripts but are also the ones that manage to affect a wide range of your emotions. The Descendants does all of that and then some. Every performance feels superb and the never-ending downward spiral feeling the story gives you is resolved in a way that not only feels natural but is completely satisfying. This is George Clooney at his best and have to say that Alexander Payne has done outstanding. It's quite possibly the most powerful and emotion-evoking film of the year.

305,WWJDWITHCA,"Unusual Hollywood Movie that Film ""Buff's"" Will Enjoy",9,31 July 2013,"If you enjoy well made ""real"" movies that develop real human emotions and portray characters as real people; you will enjoy this movie. However, if you enjoyed canned movies with the same dialogue and hollow character development and shallow plots then you will not appreciate this movie at any level. Also, when Hollywood attempts to make a ""real"" film, it ends-up being political tripe or condescending film that tells you how you are supposed to feel about societal issues, and this film amazingly does not contain that Hollywood garbage.The reviews that I read (even the positive ones) neglect to understand the lead character as a person; he is recognized as a frugal workaholic, but what most loose is that he is simply a man running his life in the best manner that he can. He attempts to provide for his family without relying on his past (he is the executor of nearly a billion dollars of land that has been handed-down from several generations), he works very hard in an attempt to provide, he's honest, dedicated and truly adores what he has in his family.Does he make his wife and children feel loved on a daily basis? Is he worried that he isn't doing enough? Does he think he needs be someone else? The answer of course is no, but how many of us can admit that we are not exactly the same way? This character is very real. He attempts to lead his life in the best possible manner that he knows yet everyone around him is telling him that he did it wrong, yet each person claiming he's flawed is in fact significantly more flawed in the manner in which they handle themselves.This movie is about real people, real emotions, real human behavior, and a man at the beginning of the film believing that his ideals were wrong all along, but coming to grips through the film that he has been true to himself and his family, that each person is accountable for their own decisions, and will continue preserve in the only manner that he knows.",The Descendants

Shailene Woodley is excellent as Alex, but her character, like Scottie's is introduced with much pathos and promise, but quickly devolves, as though Payne thought he'd done all the work he needed to do in the characters' first scenes. The mandatory, extended tourism shots to indigenous music just underscored this impression of lazy screen writing and I felt pretty frustrated by the end. I'm sure the book is baked a little better, but I don't think I'd enjoy it if the movie is anything to go by.

307,LoveYourMovies,"George Clooney raises the bar with ""The Descendants""",10,24 March 2012,"If you have ever had the privilege of watching a world class musician play while at the top of their craft you know it can be a moving and at times emotional experience. When a great blues guitarist plays, there's a reason they say they are making the guitar cry, and that's because if they do their job well enough they have the ability to move the listener to tears. Their are rare occasions when actors can do the same thing evoking the same emotions out of the viewer.George Clooney's latest film, The Descendants without question shows how an actor has the ability to pull emotion from them self and from the audience viewer. Clooney's work in this film is one of the best performances in years that features dialogue delivery and facial expressions combined for one of the most heartfelt and gut wrenching performances. Clooney has clearly set a new high for himself and a new standard in the drama/comedy world.Clooney plays Matt King a successful real estate attorney who's world is turned upside down when his wife has an accident and is in a fatal coma. King soon discovers that his wife had been cheating on him and had planned to divorce him. He is left to rediscover his two daughters and learn along the way how to begin to be a real father to them while trying to do right by them and his native homeland of Hawaii as a trust to the single largest private land owner in the state. The performance Clooney turns in is completely flawless as he runs the gamut of all feelings. He proves to be not only one of the most respected persons in Hollywood but now, quite possibly it's premiere working actor.Specifically the scene when Matt learns about his wife's infidelity from his oldest daughter, you can see every thought in Matt's head play out on his face with complete disbelief. He then quickly runs in an awkward and nervous way, to his sister in-laws and then confronts her wanting to know the details of the affair he begins to let himself feel and let out, ever so slightly the pain his is just beginning to feel and discover.Alexander Payne has a unique way of blending the serious and emotional with the comedic side that unavoidably comes with those times and situations. While one moment you are laughing at Clooney's terrible stalking abilities you are then angry and on the verge of tears as he confront's her wife's unsuspecting lover.Not lost amidst Clooney's fine performance is the acting of the rest of the superb cast from the two daughters to Matt's father in-law played but the always underrated Robert Forrester and even the oldest daughter's confidant and friend Sid who ultimately becomes a key role in Clooney's acceptance.Payne perfectly weaves the different levels of the completely new life Matt has discovered. He let's you in the mind as he continues to peel the layers away and starts his new life. He shows how King learns fatherhood along the way much later in life than he ever expected to or hoped to.The Descendants wasn't the most unique film of the year, unlike The Artist, but it was undoubtedly the most true to life and most perfectly made movie of the year. It will no doubt gain in appreciation and following as time goes on. It is the one can't and shouldn't miss film of the year. www.loveyourmovies.com",The Descendants

He is blessed with great voice. Like Mel Gibson, Russell Crowe and Paul Newman, Clooney is the full package. He can act, write, produce, direct and move between each of these scenarios with ease, or combine when he feels it necessary. THE DECENDENTS is a great film.

That one of my problem with last year's Best Picture Nominee, 'The Kids are Alright.' Everyone in that movie was too likable, so the dysfunction wasn't believable. This year, many people were rooting for The Help, which is really good, but I just think Descendants was better. An underdog story like The Help is easy to root for.To pull of a believable dysfunctional family is more difficult. In the Descendants you eventually do make an emotional investment and gain compassion despite the unlikable characters.

I felt like I had been transported to Hawaii for a nice visit. The story dealt with some serious issues, but diffused them so they weren't so disturbing.

For a moment, i couldn't find a reason why this movie should be rated less than a perfect ten.The story starts with Matt King juggling a personal trauma of about to lose his wife in a couple of weeks alongside trying to settle a family fortune of inheriting an island in Hawaii with his cousins. Also, Matt needs to pay attention to his two estranged daughters, whom he hasn't met for months due to his indulgence with work. Just when he tries to be a good husband, he realizes that his wife has been cheating with him.Now, will he be able to bring his family together and become the father of his kids and fill in the shoes of their mother, will he able to forgive his wife and above all, will he able to realize his real fortune in life?. To know more, Watch it with your family, for sure.It is a simple story told in a very heart-warming way. Hats off to Alexander Payne. George Clooney deserves all the accolades for his stupendous performance. It is to be seen, whether he takes home the Oscar for Best Actor or not.",The Descendants
313,adamcrossstills,"not terrible, but not excellent either",6,8 June 2012,"A story of how a father is thrust into re-connecting with his daughters after a boating accident lands his wife in a coma. It was much better than the trailers had led me to believe. I do try not to watch trailers because over the past 5 years or so it seems that the movie industry has got the idea into their skulls that we, the viewing public, need to have every moment of the film explained to us in a 3 minute trailer! The trailer had a heart-warming, slight comedic sense about it yet the film is nothing of the sort. Sure there are funny moments, which I was glad of, but the film in general is quite sombre; nothing out of the ordinary, nothing spectacular, just a good, solid story with identifiable characters and our leading man, George Clooney, on top form as always but certainly not ""the performance of his career"" as Empire Magazine would have you believe. I smiled, I laughed, I cried; but then I went downstairs and made myself a cup of tea and moved on to the next film. The Descendants is a film that would have loved to stay in your mind as a tale of family coming together in the most terrible of circumstances, striking triumphant new bonds in the face of emotional adversity but it isn't quite strong enough. It drifts out of your mind just as quickly as the final scene fades to black and the credits roll up. 3/5 not terrible, but not excellent either.",The Descendants
314,leecjaster,A dramatic American masterpiece,9,24 January 2012,"Alexander Payne's painstaking dramas are a vital piece of the modern cinematic landscape. Sideways was a piece of pure inspired craftsmanship, full of rich characters and a wonderfully intricate weaving of plot points that didn't feel heavy handed. Payne has perfected the art of the American drama into a craft, one that he continues to develop.The Descendants, which sports the best performance of George Clooney's career, is the best American family drama since American Beauty. Payne's careful attention to slowly crafting a script that features a complicated web of emotions, relationships, and mistakes has paid off in one of the most defining looks at the modern American family in all its glory and pitfalls.Set in Hawaii, The Descendants chronicles one of the most difficult periods of time in Matt King's life. Currently in the middle of negotiating a massage real estate deal that involves the land he and his family have inherited since the foundling of Hawaii itself, Matt finds himself taking care of his two young daughters as their mother (Elizabeth) was severely injured in a boating accident. Matt has been an absentee father, ""a back-up parent"", as Payne's script eloquently states, and now finds himself thrust in the spotlight.If the situation couldn't get complicated enough, Matt's eldest, troubled daughter Alexandra (Shailene Woodley) confesses that Elizabeth was cheating on him. The Descendants beautifully sets up a dramatic centerpiece which is full of a few unexpected and beautifully written plot points that keep things more than interesting. Payne's strength is the ability to continually keep the audience guessing what's next, knowing that whatever is on the horizon is going to enhance the already well constructed dramatic situation.Think about the last time the genuine feeling of surprise occurred at the movies. Few and far between. Payne is one of the who stays ahead of his audience, leading, instead of pushing them towards the narrative's climax.The ultimate strength of a drama relies on the fine line between telling the audience how to feel, and allowing the audience to feel the intended emotion. The best dramas take it a step further, presenting such a realistic emotional palette that the audience may not know what to feel, or feel several conflicting emotions at once. That is the high water mark for a drama, and Payne has put The Descendants among the best there is. More so than than the shining dramas of last year (Social Network, True Grit, King's Speech, Black Swan), a modern, un-stylized drama is difficult to get past the sniff test of smart audiences—there's no fallback to style.This is the life we all lead as Americans, and even though audiences will never know what went on in the courtrooms during the Facebook lawsuit (or if ""Lawyer up, asshole!"" was ever actually said), or how hard life really was on the rough lands of Arkansas for a Marshall and a young girl on a bounty hunting mission; audiences know how hard their own lives are. It presents the most difficult grading curve there is, and The Descendants couldn't have been a more effective and gut wrenching effort. It's no wonder it took Payne seven years to craft this, and it's his masterpiece... so far.OverallMovies are cheap laughs, easy entertainment, external stimulation, an adrenaline high, and exploitive money making devices. Movies are art, moving paintings, emotional experiences, and a cathartic way of coping and understanding the human condition. Some movies are a canvas for a visual genius (Malick, Fincher), a conceptual idea (Moneyball), or a novel undertaking (The Artist).Alexander Payne is the impressionistic genius of the modern American drama. Up close, it's beautiful and impactful, but when viewed from a step back, there's an overwhelming and emotional connection with something we can only connect with through art.",The Descendants
315,spheckma,I don't get all the praise!,2,5 April 2012,"I found this movie was beyond bad. Perhaps if it hadn't been so hyped I wouldn't feel this way, but it was hyped and it is at the very least a poorly written movie in that the dialog was all over the place and throwing in comedy line simply didn't work. The entire movie didn't seem to flow. Secondly, the casting was strange. The teenage boy who played Alex's friend was really mis-cast and the writer missed a big opportunity with his role as he had recently lost a parent. It certainly would have been nice to have that fact tied in more than it was. Some of the minor actors were very bad, so that I had to wonder who they were related to, and even the younger daughter was so into herself as an actress it was glaring. I had no idea why Beau Bridges was in it as he stood out too much in the group of cousins, not to mention he looked like a bum. Judy Greer's insipid voice and her overly written final scene made here character end up annoying. Finally I couldn't see any thing about George Clooney's performance that was at all good other than he basically can basically act, especially when Viggo Mortensen's performance in 'A Dangerous Method' was beyond measure, and he didn't even get nominated. What's going on? Has this turned into a popularity contest.",The Descendants

I knew nothing about it until it appeared in the TV schedules. The opening few minutes hooked me. I always enjoy George Clooney's performances. He is a consummate actor, and brings class to everything he is involved with. To continue the fishing analogy: I wrote that the opening few minutes hooked me. But the film failed to reel me in. The more I watched the less I was interested in the characters. A poor little rich family struggling with issues of infidelity does not arouse much sympathy in me. The film began to resemble a travelogue: beautiful scenery, loving lingering shots of stunning landscapes. But in all honesty it could have lost 10-15 minutes without anyone noticing. I found myself looking out for Magnum PI and Higgins. Moreover the music soon became very distracting. So why did I watch to the end? I am not sure if I can answer that question. Maybe it was because of the Oscar-winning screenplay. Maybe it was out of respect for a strong cast. But all in all I was disappointed.",The Descendants

318,diegojosmer,A Story About Family,6,19 December 2018,"The Descendants is a story about grief and family at its core. George Clooney stars in this movie that captures the life of Matt King and his two daughters after a family tragedy. The film tackles many subjects such as grief and how we cope with it, forgiveness, and the different good or bad ways a relationship can develop. While the film has those subjects at its core, it really lets the viewer decide what to think about the way our characters forgive. Its a subjective story that lets you thinking and really moves you. The performances are not over the top, instead the performers focus on transmitting the story in the most real way possible. I think the ending could have been a lot stronger but the one we got really leaves you satisfied with the emotional arc the film had.
The Descendants is a great ""piece of life"" movie with a beautiful and intimate story that cannot be missed.",The Descendants
319,adiadv1,Wow ... just wow.,10,24 February 2012,"Intense is an understatement  this was brutal. Don't get me wrong, it's totally worth it.I think at some point almost everyone is faced with the reality that someone we trusted has betrayed us. How one handles heartbreak can make or break them– and those around them – if they succumb to the power of anger or a need to seek revenge. It's amazing when you're somehow able to rise above pain and bitterness to find even a shred of positivity in something that seemed nothing but destructive. It's a gift. Jealousy, infidelity and betrayal can crush your soul if you let it. This is a raw look at a scenario that I have no trouble imagining. The often used phrase, ""What doesn't kill us makes us stronger,"" has definitely rung true for me, but it sure is hell to go through the time it can take to reveal a positive impact. Handling the negative part is exhausting, but there always seems to be something significant about the good that ultimately outweighs the bad.In a nutshell, I think it's important to try to forgive what is impossible to forget. Who you are today is a result of what you've experienced. It's up to you to choose the effect it has on you to the best of your ability at the time.No matter how you react, you must make amends and/or forgive yourself for whatever happened during an extremely stressful period in your life. And you have to work hard to forgive. There is yin and yang, balance, karma, good and bad  and ultimately there is justice even though you may never realize it. If you're fortunate, you gain an understanding and acceptance than impels you to carry on with a constructive mindset.",The Descendants

The downside of such is that we usually already make up our mind to expect a certain level of film-making and story-telling and when the movie doesn't deliver one or the other aspect of that, we begin to jot down what the movie lacked - from our assumptions, of course. So don't compare this title with any of your per-conceived notions or any other title as such; if you were.A beautiful movie, slow-paced story-telling, technically alright, and a good cast. This movie lacked perfection in many things, dialogues, cinematography, acting and so on and guess that's why it related to us in a better way. This movie is a lyric especially with the over-powering background score that sometimes was annoying, honestly. This is no unreal movie with fantasy islands, miracle workers, or super-smart kids.

322,mgorman-6,Engaging drama about relationships - not just for 'chicks',7,20 November 2011,"'Descendants' focuses on the life of a family during the days when the mother lies in a coma after a boating accident, poised between life and death. Nothing crashes or blows up on screen, but there are plenty of emotional detonations as her husband and two daughters struggle to meet the challenges and, oddly, the obligations of the unexpected, tragic crisis. This is neither a perfect family nor a perfect mess of a family - it's something in between. They are well off - definitely 1 percenters - live comfortably, and are each very engaged in their lives and communities. The girls, Mom included, are hell raisers to some degree, but in ways that attract more than repel - they each make friends and play well with others, at least some of the time. Yet the members of the family are subtly estranged from each other, and we learn from Clooney's narrative and monologues with his wife's inert form that the marriage was a source of some disappointment for both of them, a disappointment that was not confronted or resolved in their years together. The movie takes us through the resolution of this family crisis, revealing progressively what each character has withheld from the others, and loops in a larger plot involving their extended family and, in effect, the entire Island community. Clooney gives a consistent, effective performance, and is one of the reasons this movie should work alright for the average guy (Women on average tolerate him pretty well, I believe) despite it's focus on relationships as the subject matter and rather slow pace. He maintains a strong masculine 'hero' persona throughout, and definitely rises to the tragic occasion. Along the way, he responds in ways, some comic and some cliché, that make him an attractive 'male' perspective from which to view the events of the film. He is strong, well meaning, active, and ultimately prevails to a large degree in the terms of the film. I really enjoyed the performance of Shailene Woodley in the role of his daughter, poised on adulthood. Her character's response to Clooney and their work with one another represents the visible 'love story' - father-daughter in this case - that makes the movie work moment to moment.The comatose patient is very much a character in several of the most important scenes. I was struck by how silent the relatively full theater was during some of these climactic moments. The audience was neither restless nor tearful, just intent, during even the long, slow, quiet moments. Never sentimental, the film focuses on the experience of confronting death in others as an argument for living life authentically, acknowledging and resolving conflict rather than lapsing into comfortable disengagement.All in all, a fascinating couple of hours of storytelling, acting, and thought-provoking cinema. A notch or two above the average theater experience, and way higher than the average among films that tackle this category of emotional experience.",The Descendants

The story revolves around a family shattered by a devastating boating accident that they struggle to cope with, but non more so than Clooney.George Clooney carries the film exceptionally well with a touching portrayal of a man thrown out of his depth and desperately trying to come to terms the events unfolding around him. Suddenly he finds he has to take charge of a family that has grown completely dysfunctional as he is forced into the unfamiliar territory of being lead parent. It's a beautiful, mesmerising performance underlined by a deft comedic touch.

325,addiewhiz,"Beautiful story, but just not quite good enough",8,20 January 2012,"The Descendants is a very touching story about a lawyer and a father named Matt King (Clooney) who is forced into a variety of difficult situations when his wife is in a boating accident. With his wife dying, he is forced to get to know his two daughters, Alexandra and Scottie (Woodley and Miller, respectively) and cope with the fact that his wife had been unfaithful to him. Another dimension is added to the story when we learn at the beginning of the film that Matt is part Hawaiian and that he is the trustee of some ancestral land on the island of Kauai, that used to belong to Queen Liliuokalani.This film plays out very well as we see Matt slowly embracing his paternal role while Alexandra is able to slowly become more mature and fulfill her role as big sister to Scottie. Both Clooney and Woodley do an excellent job playing their roles. Clooney is very convincing as an upper middle class father who is out of touch with his family, while Woodley's performance as a fragile teenager who finds conflict amidst her own personal problems and the issues that the family is going through.However, in some way this film falls a bit short of greatness, because it sets up a few dimensions for the story that are never fulfilled or even discussed. For example, in the beginning of the story, Alexandra is introduced as an out-of-control teen who has a drug problem. When she comes home from boarding school, she tells her father that her condition is improving, after which we never hear about her problem again. In addition, at the beginning, we see that Scottie is having problems with the other children in school and that she is having trouble expressing herself and the loss that she is going through due to pending loss of her mother. We do not really see this develop in any way, and in the end, we just see her crying over the loss, which is supposed to indicate that she has finally found a way to let her feelings out. In that sense, I felt a little short changed by the end. The final flaw in this film is the addition of the character, Sid (Krause). Sid serves little to no purpose in this film. He is in no way a dynamic character, nor does he serve to help any of the other characters develop. At the beginning, he simply appears as Alexandra's immature love interest and from that point on, he is just strung along for the ride.Overall, I feel this film was good but that it doesn't live up to the hype and praise that it has been receiving. It's nice to see once, but that's about it",The Descendants

327,wwillcox561,The Descendants Review,9,5 April 2012,"There is a reason why this film was nominated so many times for the Academy Awards. Simply put, this film is absolutely brilliant. The story of Matt King is a fascinating one to say the least. His wife goes into a coma due to a boating accident and is told that there is no sign of her ever coming out of it. To add on to that he finds out that his wife has been cheating on him because of how rocky their marriage has been recently. This movie is great because its setting is in Hawaii and the cinematography used to convey the everyday life of an islander is a really interesting perspective. The reason I really loved this movie was because while it is serious drama about Matt King and the problems he goes through (trying to figure out who the other man is, dealing with his two daughters, and the death of his wife) there is a lot of hilarious comedic relief that George Clooney and the supporting cast provide. You feel like you should be sad watching this movie, and even at the most sad dramatic parts you find yourself hysterically laughing. For example, when he tells his oldest daughter that her mom is going to die he tells her while she is swimming in the pool. It was clearly the wrong time and place to tell her about something so traumatic yet there is something so awkwardly funny about it.",The Descendants
328,themoviecouch,Just aiight.,4,23 June 2012,"""Friends on the mainland think that living in Hawaii must be like living in Paradise.Well Paradise can go f--k itself."" These are the words of a guy who is having a really bad time in a really beautiful place. Matt King (George Clooney) is a well-to-do lawyer whose wife is in a terminal coma after a boating accident. Their daughters Alexandra (Shailene Woodley) and Scottie (Amara Miller) are both acting out, and then Matt receives the bombshell that prior to the accident his wife had been having an affair and had planned to ask for a divorce. Meanwhile, Matt is the hereditary, legal trustee of a large, extremely valuable hunk of Hawaiian beachfront. He and his cousins are all heirs, but he has legal control of the property, and changes to the law have made it necessary for them to sell the place.Watching Matt sort through all this should be more interesting than it is. The setup of a failing marriage being interrupted by a coma provides rich emotional grist, and Clooney does an okay job portraying the complex emotions, but the script makes a mockery of the situation. Matt winds up stalking the real-estate agent with whom his wife was cheating, even following the guy to a different island. I'm not saying that no one would ever do that, but I don't think that an intelligent, contained lawyer like Matt King would do something so stupid and useless. Then the way they have Matt handle the land sale feels very perfunctory and arbitrary. Finally, the goodbye scene between Matt and his comatose wife is pure dreck, mostly ruining the rest of the movie for me. There are a couple of bright spots. Shailene Woodley has gotten a lot of hype, and deservedly so. She is a beautiful and talented actress and holds her own quite well against George Clooney. Robert Forster is quite convincing as Matt's asshole father-in-law. His character is not really likable, but the way he handles his grief is convincing. ""The Descendants"" also has an important social message in its discussion of advanced medical directives. These are legal papers that someone prepares detailing what their wishes would be should they ever be severely ill or in a coma, including the conditions under which they would want to be removed from life support. The decision to withdraw care from Matt's wife is made much easier for the family because she had an advanced directive. This is a good message for people to hear. I wish it could be presented in a better movie.",The Descendants

Many of the positive reviews I see here mention elements that I enjoyed, such as the very good acting by the young actress playing the elder daughter. I also agree with some of the negative comments - I thought it moved a little too slowly in places (too much scenery), and the attempts at comedy were a bad idea (Clooney running clumsily down the hill to a neighbor's house, the peering over the hedge bit, etc.) Maybe George Clooney is just too George Clooney to be believable as a regular Joe, but I was unpersuaded by any of his emotions: jealousy, betrayal, grief, anger, all I saw was George Clooney.I haven't read the book, so I don't know if the story elements I disliked were introduced by the filmmaker. I thought it silly that Clooney tries to track down his wife's lover by just wandering aimlessly around another Hawaiian island. And his final decision about what to do with the land might have meant something to me - and told me something about his values - but it was ruined for me by the unnecessary plot twist that involved his wife's lover in one of the bidding syndicates. And the ashes on the water ending was just too smarmy for words - the movie should have ended with Clooney's final scene with his wife.I don't know why the lover's wife has quite the large role she does. Her final appearance makes her a candidate for sainthood, but the movie isn't about her, so why go through this? Maybe they just needed one adult female in the movie to be likable?I kind of liked that Sid wasn't really as much of a jerk as he pretended to be, but nothing came of him.dvejr",The Descendants

The mother of the family has suffered a major injury, rendering her to a coma. The family self reflects & comes together on the tragedy. There is a back story to the underlining guilt of the protagonists in the story. It is their quest to find answers & confront them, which is the fuel to it. The self guilt & the little bit of evil that lie in each of the characters does well in the development of this story.

Scenes are being shown because, err, it's a movie I wouldn't say it was a bad idea to make this film; just the realisation could and should have been much better. Of course Hawaii is nice but I didn't watch the movie to see Hawaii. Anyway, good few scenes were shot when it was overcast and I'm not quite sure that was the intention. The land selling part of the story was just too obvious from the beginning. Well, how was he going to decide? As for George Clooney, I saw him only as George Clooney. Maybe it's not his fault, maybe the script didn't give him the opportunity to ""shine"". Anyway, this film clearly misses something that could have made it into a very good film.

334,lionmoonfilms,It's like reading a great short story,9,1 October 2012,"This is not a complicated story, and there is no typical Hollywood over-dramatization to get you any adrenaline rush, but as plain as the story is, I love this movie for this very reason. Weirdly, watching this movie is like reading a short story, and you get the similar satisfaction of reading a great short story. The voice-over of Matt King (Clooney) in the opening scene sets the mood, and most importantly, it sets a philosophical tone: no matter how unique you are (real or being perceived), your sufferings are same as everyone else's. I have absolutely nothing in common with Matt King—where I live, how I make a living, how my marriage is going, etc., (with only one exception, that we are both male), but by the closing of the story, I identified myself with Matt so much that I was absolutely convinced what Matt had been through would have happened to me. Or philosophically, it had already happened. The director Alexander Payne was able to pull this off because he doesn't let actors (even with the statue like Clooney), dialogues (keep them concise and barely minimum), and setting (make it simple but not boring) get into the story. He's a master of realism, so the movie is almost like a documentary. Clooney is wonderful for not over-doing Matt King, and Shailene Woodley is terrific matching up with Clooney as his elder daughter Alexandra. I'm not quite sure about the role of Sid, Alexandra's friend. This is the only role in the movie that I think the screenwriter could have done a better job. Although I didn't get any adrenaline rush while seeing the movie, I was lingering about it afterward, much longer than a lot other movies I saw.

I fell a sleep the first time i try to watch this movie on the first 30 mins. So i decided to give it another chance... unfortunately i didn't sleep on the second time, i wish i had, at least i'd have recover some hours of my sleep.

337,chrisarciszewska,Just dreary,2,3 February 2012,"Like all the others who have given this film poor reviews, I am completely mystified as to why anyone would ever think it worth 9 or 10 stars. It is quite simply a very bad film. Wooden acting, poor timing (this may have be the director's fault), very annoying music, hardly any storyline and no feeling of involvement with any of the characters. Was it meant to be a comedy? It was more like a very boring poorly made reality TV programme. I just don't understand how a studio can spend millions of $, produce such rubbish and then have the cheek to put it out on general release. Apparently I have to have 10 lines of text to submit a review, but there really isn't anything else I'd like to say about this film. I quite liked the Sid character. My daughter says it might have worked with Bill Murray in the lead role or it had been directed by Wes Anderson",The Descendants
338,brianbinkle123,"Entertaining, but unfortunately unsatisfying.",3,31 January 2012,"When I was searching for a good film to see last night I saw that this one had some of the highest ratings. So I chose to attend this film. Sadly, after attending the movie I was left wondering why it was so highly rated.I have to give the acting a big thumbs up. The characters were very well portrayed, and the reactions to these situations was well played. I am able to say if these situations were happening to someone in real life that even I would have felt very much like the actors. I may have possibly even reacted the way they did at some points in the film.I just have to say that the film began down a path that became very unsatisfying very early on. This was of no fault of the actors they simply portrayed the characters as if these situations were real, and did quite well at it. Unfortunately, Hollywood is sticking more and more unrealistic combinations together again.The family life portrayal on the big screen is becoming more and more unrealistic as time goes by. The sad thing is that when more people see this behavior played out by big Hollywood titles it slowly creeps it's way into the home.Realistically though I know people from all walks of life and can assure that most of these scenarios are far fetched. Children of 10 years of age using the foulest words known in front of their parent(s) without discipline. A seventeen year old daughter talking like a whore in front of her parent(s). The seventeen year old daughter bringing home her new disrespectful boyfriend to go on vacation with her without previous notification.In real life the ten year old would get put in the quiet room for half an hour per word. The seventeen year old daughter would soon be looking for a new apartment, or stop talking like that in front of the parents and 10 year old. The seventeen year old's boy friend would be beaten half to death by the father, or driven to the nearest gas station to call home for a ride.I could believe the situation with wife to be completely possible in the context of situations this film portrayed. I will add that if any man or woman doesn't show their spouse affection for that long of a period of time then such problems can arise.Again, coming back to reality; hopefully, no one is dumb enough to allow their family to get as distorted as this film portrayed this family. I believe with little effort this entire scenario could be made nonexistent in the world today.I know a wide variety of families from all walks of life. People living in the finest mansions to people living in trailer parks, and rarely have I ever met a family in such a disaster as the one portrayed in this film.I have to rate only 3/10; 3 for the well played characters by the actors. -7 stars due to the incredible lack of realistic family life that is continuously portrayed by these types of films.",The Descendants
339,AaronLYM,A Wonderful Family Experience...,10,23 January 2014,"I have never been to Hawaii before, and the first thing this movie successfully does is showing me the sights and sounds of Hawaii. The scenery is truly beautiful and breathtaking, while the music is brilliantly composed and soothing to the ears. I think George Clooney is exceptionally outstanding in playing the main character, who is troubled with so many things at a time. The emotions that his character experiences throughout the movie really show on his face, and I can only sympathize with his misfortunes. This is a great movie to share with the whole family, as it stresses a lot on family issues and values. The movie shows a really accurate depiction of what a family goes through after losing an important member, and how they deal with it. To see how an estranged father takes ownership, reconciles with his daughters and supports them through their hardship is really a heartwarming experience. The final scene of the movie really says it all and I think it's the perfect ending. I was filled with sheer joy and utter satisfaction.",The Descendants

341,The_Frase,"Worthy of the nominations, but not for everyone",7,22 January 2012,"The much hyped and eagerly awaited film release of one of this years' main award title contenders will always divide opinion based on its critical and public receptions. Here is a film that will most likely be enjoyed and celebrated by critics, those close to the industry and avid movie goers and perhaps less so by the general public as this film lack that easy to digest nature and offers little in the form of easy gratification....Full review - read more: The timely release of the latest and much anticipated Alexander Payne offering has lead the film to numerous nominations on both sides of the Atlantic. From best picture, best direction and leading actor the nominations point this film on a high flying trajectory.The film from the outset develops a complex and emotionally gruelling story line of a severely injured mother, dysfunctional daughters, and an emotional distant, incapable father. The journey of the family's struggle to come to terms with their situation as well as deal with an historic land sale and embattled extended family subplots delves between the crushing blows of realisation, (beautifully executed examples by Shailene Woodley and Beau Bridges) and moments of hilarity (Clooney, Bridges and Nick Krause) that will turn in an instant keeping the emotional journey of the characters at the for front of the audiences experience.Similar to Paynes other work, this bitter sweet combination of tragedy and comedy drives the narrative and allows the characters to slowly reveal their motivations and build the body of understanding and circumstance to the films events. The tightrope that us as the viewer tread between these two camps are also beautifully displayed in the shot construction, bouncing between the confined and bland surroundings of the hospital room and the grand majestic pans and establishing shots of the family's' land plot. There are numerous stunning shots that will echo the 'paradise lost' theme as the characters travel islands of Hawaii, adding the analogy that the family and every member were similar to the archipelago - part of one but forever separate and alone.The stirring performance by Clooney, taking a step outside his usual area of comfort, is the perfect embodiment of a man far out his depth and ill-equipped to deal with the lesson life is about to teach him let alone prepare and shepherd his family through it. He is masterful in his achievement and without this backbone of a performance we would be greeting a very different film.The film is an enjoyable and emotion watch, it will lead to a triumph of independent cinema, to challenge the audience's current view or expectation of themselves. But its only failing would be of its overall appeal to a larger, mainstream audience.Lacking the prosaic and obtuse comedy elements that sit so well with the main studios as well as the grand feel good moment to round off the film and have everyone leave happy. It could also be argued that the film lacks the gravity or force to really challenge the audience. It does convey mixed messages and the overall conclusion or message of the story is open to interpretation.The film is cleverer and less apologetic to such nuances of Hollywood convention but steers close enough to attract the attention and gaze of many of its flock. The film is well worth a watch and is a worthy award contender on this year's award circuit but may have been overawed by some areas of the critical community.7/10 The_Frase",The Descendants
342,MayaKavanagh,George Clooney can't save me from this one.,6,25 November 2013,"I am not a fan of George Clooney. I've said this once before and I'll stick by it, even if he wins every bloody Oscar the academy throw at him. I just find him to be one of those smarmy, too- grinny actors that you just want to punch in the face. At least that's my opinion.There is one redeeming quality about him though and its his recent involvement in the Oscar nominated The Descendants. Directed and written by Alexander Payne (sharing the writing credits with Nat Faxon and Jim Rash), The Descendants follows the life of Matt King, a real estate agent in Hawaii whose fortunate family have allowed him to live a comfortable, stress-free existence for most of his life. That is until his wife, Elizabeth (played by Patricia Hastie), hits her head in a boating accident and falls into a coma. What follows is a humorous journey between a father, his two daughters, and a delinquent teenager, as they attempt to find out about their soon-to-be-late mother's extramarital lover (and inadvertently find out a lot more about themselves in the process).I enjoyed this movie as much as I did not enjoy it. Acting, cinematography and editing were all a little subpar with a bizarre soundtrack which did not add much depth to the overall narrative. However, there was a subtle beauty in this film which I did enjoy, despite my brain's constant chanting of ""We Hate Clooney! We Hate Clooney!"" (yes, its a bad habit. Apologies). The writing in this film was exquisite. Faxon, Rash and Payne had all made plenty of effort to piece together the various elements of this family's story whilst interweaving an intricate web of the usual ""6°of Separation"" theory contrasted again the unusual, tropical paradise of Hawaii. Each individual character in this film was cleverly crafted into their own roles. Whilst Clooney took up A LOT of story time, his character was more of an emotionless canvas upon which our other colourful characters painted themselves. Shailene Woodley who plays Alexandra and Amara Miller who plays Scotty work brilliantly against Clooney's obvious discomfort with children so that we clearly see a family who don't know that much about each other really but understand that above all, family does have a special bond, no matter what the circumstances in which they were brought together (I think many of us can agree with this statement). Another aspect to the screenplay which was cleverly conducted was the integration of the very Hawaii-nesqueness in which the story unfolds. Drama happens behind closed doors. Secrets unfold in major tsunamis and soft ripples. And everybody knows everybody, making the whole concept behind this family's difficult social situation that much more reactive.I believe the Academy nominated The Descendants for both best adapted screenplay, director, and picture due to its poignant yet abnormal story that a lot of audience members will enjoy listening to. I do know also that Clooney's acting in this film was MUCH better than his recent adventures (Intolerable Cruelty anyone?) and his character for the first time was not so much George Clooney as it was more Matt King, a fact I could stomach much more easily with my popcorn and Diet Coke. I do think this film will do well at the Oscars but as for the Best Picture nod, I am waiting for a few more viewings before resting that decision on this film.",The Descendants
343,pedestrian0,"Emotionally hollow and, even worse, boring",2,23 November 2011,"This movie was a bust. The premise is simple—unbelievably simple, given the length of the movie: a man's wife goes into a coma as the result of a boating accident and he learns, via one of his daughters, that she was having an affair. There's more to it, of course, but nothing interesting: e.g., Clooney in voice-over tells us he's ""the back up parent,"" so we see a few scenes of him failing at being ""Mr. Mom"" and a few scenes of him fighting with his eldest daughter. Yet, remarkably, a half-hour into the movie the entire family is getting along so well that they all troop off to a different Hawaiian island in search of the mystery man Mom was having the affair with, with the oldest daughter even playing a lead detective role.What unfolds is hour upon hour of the family walking on beaches, driving down roads, etc., all of which culminates in a kitchen scene where Clooney confronts the man, played by Matt Lillard, about the affair. Lillard, whose acting has not deepened from his Scooby-Doo days, ensures that the scene has no dramatic impact. Then it's back to the hospital to watch Mom die.The script is unbelievably flat-footed; its idea of humor is having children shout profanity at each other. (I'm no prude—-but I'm not 12, either.) There's even an odd disconnect to the more ""dramatic"" scenes. Because we've never seen anyone interact with Mom—she's just a corpse, lying there—we have no way of judging the believability of anyone's reaction to her death. We're simply bludgeoned by the musical score into accepting that any given scene is sad. The movie operates on a simple syllogism: the characters are crying, so you should too.Still, judging by the audience's reaction, this movie will be a major success. I'm enough of an adult to admit when I'm odd-man-out. At each curse word, the audience roared with laughter; for each tear-jerker scene, the waterworks flowed. The Hawaiian landscape is beautifully shot, and the Hawaiian music is lovely, too. Unfortunately, I didn't pay $9.50 for a travelogue.",The Descendants
344,tependris,Just an O.K. movie.,7,22 January 2012,"In my opinion it was an O.K. movie, especially considering the 2011's lack of quality movies, nothing special however. I still can't decide whether Clooney acted above his acting standards or not, maybe it's his one-dimensional cool persona, that was established after dozens of pretty much similar films, maybe it's his face that can't easily express deeper feelings, but i think these tears he cried didn't seem convincing enough. Anyway, it's a movie that doesn't try hard to awaken emotions, succeeds in keeping an equilibrium between laughs and cries and except for one or two scenes that seemed overblown it was rather fun to watch. Good acting by the comatose woman (lol) and the three kids!",The Descendants
345,khun-marcus,This side of paradise,8,14 December 2011,"The reluctant patriarch thrust into various roles of responsibility after his wife falls ill; infighting between relatives over land; marital infidelity – ""The Descendants"" has all the makings of a cliché-ridden cable movie of the week. What sets this film apart is not only the way it is memorably directed by Payne, but also the setting. It is Hawaii, and this Hawaii is not always the type of Hawaii that is sold at travel kiosks. In this Hawaii, there are swaying palm trees, gorgeous sunsets, and drinks with mini-umbrellas sticking out them, but there are also escalating tensions, moral and ethical dilemmas, and dire consequences. Paradise? ""Paradise can go **** itself"" the patriarch (played by Clooney, virtually in every frame of this movie) laments at the beginning.Coming from someone who was born, raised and still living in Hawaii I admired how Payne deconstructed Hawaii from its mirage as a tranquil sanctuary and instead unveiled it as a place with universal problems anyone from anywhere in the world could relate to. In fact, it is when Payne overly infatuates on Hawaii's hallucinatory beauty that the film loses its focus and deflates the central pathos of the film (the puerile Sid, mostly provided as comic relief, wasn't a strong point either). Consider the numerous shots of Hawaii's landscape, the constant use of cheery Hawaiian music, or in particular the sequence where Matt, along with his daughters and his older daughter's boyfriend, stroll along a sandy beach of Kauai, which goes on for an unnecessarily extended period of time, not adding any substantial depth to the story or the characters. It brought to mind Chris Isaak's video for ""Wicked Game"" where the imagery was not really saying much else except yes, Hawaii has nice beaches and scenery. Perhaps Payne became, like most people outside looking in, intoxicated by the mystique of Hawaii – who could blame him? – but when he detaches himself and steers back on track to the characters, their choices and the resulting consequences, the film excels.While ""The Descendants"" does an admirable job of breaking the mold of typical stories set in Hawaii, I consider it merely scratching the surface in redefining how people tell (and view) stories about this unique place, and I was left desiring more. Someday I'd like to see a film about the grittier side of Hawaii – a film not told from the perspective of Punahou-educated upper-class characters that mostly inhabit this film (side note: Punahou is the most expensive private school in Hawaii, a school usually reserved for the ""elite"" whose alumni includes President Obama) but from common, ordinary locals. This side of Hawaii has been covered in some novels (the writing of Hawaii born/raised/educated Lois-Ann Yamanaka comes to mind), and even TV shows (""Dog the bounty hunter"" is an obvious choice; never mind the sensational unrealism of ""Hawaii Five-O,"" both old and new versions), but to see a serious film about the various adversities people in Hawaii face everyday could be an audacious vision in the right hands. With the amount of seedy activities that take place in Waikiki and Chinatown after dark, the increasing amount of corruption in the HPD, the shady dealings politicians and other elites partake in, or the dynamic relationships between locals and ""haoles"" that this movie barely touches upon, there's no end to the amount of material to draw from and depict that sometimes Hawaii is an idyllic paradise only on the outside.",The Descendants
346,s_imdb-18-540293,two hours long funeral,3,28 October 2012,"spoilers alert %%% - This movie is really worthless. A 2 hour long funeral, a wife and mother dying, cheating fights with a dying woman attached on a machine, some postcard hawaiian culture, a non-sense story with the daughter and his friend joining the father going around to announce the death of the dying woman, all very predictable and boring, the only thing worth watching is Shailene Woodley, really beautiful (if you didn't know her already, i didn't). Very sentimental and cheesy, immature people becoming a little more mature and at the end the disturbed family sits down watching TV together, after the dying woman is finally dead. This is the meaning (?!). And the husband suddenly doesn't sell the ancestors land because he's hawaiian and he suddenly feels some hawaiian duty toward his blood... Something like that. It may be original because of how bad, unoriginal, non-sense and yet predictable it is. A 1 star, 2 extra stars for the girl and a couple of funny jokes, not enough for a 2 hours long funeral.

I am not quite sure if that makes sense, but do not want to be a spoiler! The acting of all characters is beyond average and George and Shailene deserve at least recognition for supporting this brilliant story.

348,graewarren,A worthy contender at the 84th Academy Awards,8,6 February 2012,"Based on the novel by Kaui Hart, The Descendants is a situational dramedy of a family in crisis that isn't too far from reality. A perfect dosage of awkward comedy keeps the pace of the film delightful to follow, even with its tragic storyline. There is a wide variety of characters and the film does an extraordinary job of exposing each of their individual personalities. Each character is faced with a new responsibility and has to overcome their personal issues by working with each other. The story revolves around a Matt King (George Clooney) and his two daughters, in what has become a very dysfunctional family. As the story thickens the audience is given both sides of the story and things become less black and white, thus challenging your own disposition and burrowing its way into your memory bank for a long time. In my opinion The Descendants far exceeds Payne's 2004 film Sideways, which is a similar character study film. The Descendants has already taken home two Golden Globe Awards and is a well deserving contender at the 84th Annual Academy Awards.",The Descendants

350,tomlinde,Watch for Two Descents,9,24 April 2013,"One way to watch this movie is to think about various uses of the word ""descend"". The title refers to family lineage of course, but we can descend into chaos, into deeper emotions or into relationships with depth. We may ""fall"" in love, fall into routines, we ""settle down"" and so on. And of course, we can descend in water.There are three key scenes of descent into water. The film opens with who we learn later is the ill-fated wife and mother as she falls from grace. She sits passively in a speeding boat, letting her illicit lover steer, oblivious to the destruction just ahead.The next water scene is still early in the movie, when her husband, Matt King (did he have to have this name?), played by George Clooney approaches his angry, teenage daughter Alexandra (Shaylene Woodley), as she swims. He breaks the news that her mom, now on life support following a boat crash, will not survive. As she absorbs the news she sinks into the water in silent agony. She is over her head, we might say, in turbulent emotions. Still working hard to hide her vulnerability as she strides away, her endearing teenage response is, ""I can't believe you told me in the POOL!""Within a few days, we see this girl grow into a woman. We follow primarily the Clooney character however, as he exhibits both clumsiness and grace while he cleans up his wife's mess and as he reshapes ties to his family, both nuclear and extended.Clooney plays his role with low-key affect. This is intriguing at a moment in the film when Alexandra's seemingly goofy male friend reveals that he himself has lost a parent tragically. Clooney looks at him blankly, a bit short on compassion. Perhaps in that moment though, he is seeing revealed the resourcefulness of his daughter and the depth of her caring.The final scene is a world of coziness. By this time, Matt has directed the protection of a large parcel of land, as idyllic as Eden, and we could think of the family as biblical descendants. The ones, perhaps, who shall inherit the earth.Just prior to this, the camera descends into water again. Like a bookend, the image contrasts with what we saw in the swimming pool. This time as we see not anguish but serenity, as we descend from the waves above to the still waters below.",The Descendants

This may be his best effort yet, in my opinion... Some may disagree, but just know I'm not the biggest Sideways fan. But now, perhaps I will re-watch it. Anyway, I really enjoyed this.George Clooney really knocks it out of the park, as expected. Shailene Woodley, who plays Clooney's character's oldest daughter, does an unexpectedly fantastic job. Who is this girl? Apparently the star of some ABC Family show... Welcome to the movies, girl, you've earned it. And welcome back Matthew Lillard! Great to see you, you were terrific as well.

353,MichaelMontoya2517,From a person who's lived through it....,10,13 February 2012,"This movie is one of the best movies I've seen in a while, and that's judging it from what it is. I became a fan of A P after watching Sideways and ended up reading the book before watching the movie. I think the biggest problem people have with this movie is that it's not the typical ""HOLLYWOOD"" movie that forces ""emotion"" down our throat nor is it the typical ""INDIE"" film with shaky cameras, far out one shots and so on. It's simple, a bit plain, and raw. We're presented with characters that may not seem interesting at first look, but when it comes down to it, AP has once again showed us a reflection of ourselves and people we know around us. We're normal. We're not all flashy people with cool lives and have interesting personalities. Some people just ARE and live that way. I recently lost the person who would have been my mother in law. I'm twenty four, and my girlfriend is twenty two, and her little sister is fourteen. My girlfriend has recently taken custody over her sister, and with their father passing away before the little sister was born, I've found myself in a bit of a father role and it's scary and new and very strange at times. I completely related to Clooney's character right away, and could feel the frustration he felt, and the emotions he felt. I think he did well with dealing with them. It felt real to me. In fact, everyone's emotions toward the tragedy the film presents felt very real. I saw those same reactions from sisters, aunties, uncles, grandfathers and grandmothers. Some blamed others while others completely lost it. Some felt mad, while others just cried and broke down. Some were oblivious to the news(like the grand mother in the movie) while others were simply there to comfort(Sid). I really appreciated the entire movie, scenery, and dialogue(and at times lack there of). I really enjoyed the frustration they felt one minute, the humor the next, and the forgetfulness of the tragedy at times. It was like seeing a movie based on what my girlfriend and I were going through, and it felt comforting that someone had captured that so well. Not every tragedy will be filled with a room full of criers. Some might. Not all we be filled with humor and relief. Some will. For us, it was everything. It didn't seem real, and at times, it seemed dull. This movie has a special way of presenting itself in that manner and I really liked it. I'm sure not everyone will like. Either they're use to super hero action movies, horror movies, or stuff like Twilight. Maybe you are into good dramas and indie flicks and for whatever reason you didn't connect with that one. For me, a person who's just lived through it and am discovering to be a dad type to someone I'm still getting to knowit was simple, perfect.10/10",The Descendants

Otherwise, stop the hate because you have no clue to what you're reviewing. Parents, think back when you watched an emotional scene in a movie and understood it.

357,sundog-jr,Possibly one of the best written movies in recent history,10,4 July 2012,"I just finished watching this movie for the second time. I rented it after seeing it in theaters months earlier, and I have to say, it's even better the second time around. The Descendants is emotionally gripping and provocative on so many levels, not just because of the acting from the likes of George Clooney, but the entire supporting cast. But what really drove this movie home for me was the superb writing. The dialogue is so well placed and delectable, if not absolutely brilliant. It takes much skill to write a movie so emotionally distressing, yet humorously touching at the same time. I can't figure out how Alexander Payne and company fused those two aspects together so tastefully without sugarcoating anything to the viewer. This is mostly seen through Alex's character, who is portrayed spot on by Shailene Woodley, as the foul-mouthed, but pitiable daughter who helps Matt (Clooney) track down the man who had an affair with his wife, Brian Speer (Matthew Lilliard, in a refreshingly serious role considering his more recent poor comedic performances) I won't give away any more details for those of you reading who haven't seen this film yet, but the events that ensue make for one of the most entertaining, and in my opinion, one of the best movies of 2011. I have to say, if I could've voted for the winner of the Oscar for best picture, I would've voted for The Descendants. I've seen The Artist, and I don't want to take anything away from it, because I thoroughly enjoyed it as well, but personally I think the Descendants was the all-around best cinematic experience I had in all of 2011. This could possibly be one of the most underrated films of the year, regardless of its justly awarded Oscar for Best Screenplay, and I would highly recommended this to any serious movie-goer.",The Descendants

There is very little to laugh about in this film. It is essentially a soap opera about the travails of rich family in Hawaii. Most of the characters are dysfunctional and not particularly likable, including the children. There is little that is redemptive or worth celebrating or that we could even relate to.The acting is well done, particularly the young woman who plays the teenage daughter. Some of the scenic shots were nice. The soundtrack, which was mostly Hawaiian music (lots of slack key guitar) was great.

Often there is more time showing Hawiian scenery (don't get me wrong, it's beautiful) for transition purposes than action.They could have cut the film by 10 minutes without as much scenery transition.I was also disappointed that there wasn't more back-story on the wife. It would have been a little more interesting to me to see how she felt alienated by her workaholic husband and maybe even what led her to chase the real estate guy. All in all I give a ""6"" because of the performances.",The Descendants
360,laursecan,"Really, really great film......",9,19 December 2011,"The Descendants (2011) I walked out of the film ""The Descendants"" hoping that my fellow movie goers could not see that my face was completely tear stained and red. I think when you look up the term ""tear jerker"" in the dictionary (is that term actually IN the dictionary? Must check, later) - there would be a photo of the either the movie poster for this film or maybe just a close up of George Clooney's eyes. And, what beautiful, windows to the soul those eyes are! But, I get ahead of myself.Set in Hawaii, ""The Descendants"" is a film about a man forced to make some major decisions. Decisions regarding property, decisions regarding his children, decisions regarding life. The film begins right smack dab in the middle. Matt King (George Clooney) is a married, father of two girls. His wife, Elizabeth, has been in a serious boating accident and is lying in the hospital in a coma. Matt, a lawyer by trade, has been thrust into becoming the main care taker for his youngest daughter, Scottie (Amarilla Miller). Very early in the film, Matt is informed that his wife's condition is irreversible and he must make the decision to remove her from life support.At the same time, Matt is the partial owner (along with many, many cousins) of a considerable amount of land on the Island of Kawaii. Matt and his cousins are descendants of King Kamehameha and this enormous and gorgeous piece of land has been trusted to them. Matt has the responsibility of making the final decision regarding the sale of this land, which has personal, legal, financial, and political implications.Matt and Scottie travel in the middle of the night to the big island of Hawaii to retrieve his eldest daughter, Alex (Shailene Woodley) who has been away at college. It becomes very obvious that Alex has some behavioral issues as she is found, not in her dorm room, but out on the beach with a girlfriend, obviously intoxicated. Back at home, Matt reveals to Alex the seriousness of his wife's condition. It is revealed that Alex and her mother had some ""issues"" and had not been getting along prior to the accident. Alex then reveals to Matt the cause of their quarrel. Elizabeth had been having an affair. The look of disbelief, hurt, anger, and sadness that pervades Matt's face (through George Clooney's eyes) was truly amazing. Both George Clooney and Shailene Woodley created a scene that was both honest and heartbreaking.The film follows the next few days in Matt's life - as he makes these difficult, but necessary, decisions - while, at the same time searches out his wife's lover. Along the way, he navigates through informing his in-laws of their daughter's impending death, negotiations with his cousins on the property sale, dealing with his daughters' grief, as well as his own.The performances were superb. Most notable (in addition to Clooney and Woodley) were Robert Forster as Matt's father in law and Nick Krause as Alex's boyfriend Sid, who shows that even a shaggy haired pot head has some depth beneath the surface.All in all, a very, very good film. Be prepared. This is not a ""fun"" film. It is depressing, dark, and sad. Bring some tissues.",The Descendants
361,ccjorgensen,I found this movie true to life,9,26 February 2012,"I found this film true to life. Almost every thing a character did appeared to me to be something some person might do. I found myself caring about the characters quickly. There are several turns of the plot, all of them to me feasible. The teenage daughter's actions in her first several scenes are all so credible.Her response when her father accuses her of not respecting authority is wonderful and true to life in the sense that this is how some teenagers would respond. I was pleased that the movie did not over sexualize the teenage daughter to make the movie more enticing as directors often do. I have a doctorate in psychology and sociology. I taught for almost forty years and had a small amount of experience as a co-therapist with a licensed therapist. Saw the movie with a nurse. I double checked several times by asking her whether character's responses to medical situations were ones she had observed. Her answers were ""Yes."" Our experiences do not mean our judgments are correct. It does mean they are informed. As opposed to many who criticize the movie, I have only two qualms. The daughter's boyfriend seemed to me a little too much of a doofus. The ending is a little pat. Small concerns for what was otherwise a very credible script, exploring issues almost never so realistically explored. Excellent acting. Clooney plays a man whose emotional expression is restricted, whose capacity to interact well with others somewhat limited, but who has integrity and wants to do the right thing. This calls for a restrained performance in which nuances reveal character. to my mind Clooney nails it. As for the viewer who didn't understand why Clooney runs to the house of his wife's friend. He runs there because Clooney's character thinks she knows why his wife did what she did. He also runs awkwardly. A great touch when Clooney could so easily have run athletically.",The Descendants
362,nic-of-time,An extremely well-crafted film,10,25 February 2012,"Alexander Payne has that rare talent of making films that walk the fine line between serious drama and light-hearted comedy. Both sides of the coin are equally successful in ""The Descedants"", and neither side ever threatens to overpower the other. You can be crying one moment, and laughing out loud the next. Kind of like life.The production values in the Hawaii location are, of course, spectacular. Much has also been said about George Clooney's performance, and it deserves all the praise it has received. But I would like to point out that Shailene Woodley turns in a remarkable performance as Matt's daughter Alexandra. It has made me all the more sad that her character on The O.C. was recast in the third season.",The Descendants
363,bmcd10,Best Picture of 2011,10,3 January 2012,"The Descendants is my personal favorite film of that year because of its intricacies of emotion, humor, entertainment, characters, setting, and, most importantly, realism. Alexander Payne has officially become one of my favorite filmmakers with this work, which was preceded by his other notable works, About Schmit and Sideways. The dialogue in this film is so true and moving that it easily rivals the works of Quentin Tarantino. I also want to give credit to the best ensemble cast of year, including George Clooney, Beau Bridges, Robert Forster, Matthew Lillard, Judy Greer, the newcomer, Shailene Woodley, etc. By the way, Clooney and Woodley deserve the Oscars in their respective categories; this is the best of Clooney's performances. The story follows three different sub-plots: the permanent coma and inevitable and fast-approaching death of the wife of Matt King (Clooney) and dealing with his immediate and extended family with how to tell them and move on with life after the tragedy, the selling of the last virgin piece of Hawaiian land owned by the King family since the 1860s (hence the title: The Descendants) and of which Matt is the sole trustee, and, of course, the discovery and confrontation of the guy who was sleeping with Matt's wife. The stories go along so very seamlessly and logically that it keeps the audience absolutely enthralled until the very end. The film deals with a gravely sensitive issue: crappy parents, but, in this case, crappy moms. I'm not talking about the ones who don't provide for their children or give them enough attention; I'm talking about the ones who are quite simply bad people that are self-centered and hurt the people around them in some way all the time. As the film confirms, the children of these moms don't find out how crappy they are until they are like adults; observe the relationship between Alex (Woodley) and her mom and then observe the relationship between, or rather the perception of, that mom with the younger sister Scotty. A lot of people automatically stereotype teenagers and tend to write off their views and opinions because they suspect them of being drug-using, ""dad-hating,"" irresponsible, sex crazed maniacs as a result of personal experience. However, even if one might be a drug-using, ""dad-hating,"" irresponsible, sex crazed maniac, a teenager can be right and can even have a good sense of judging whether their parent is a genuinely bad person or not. Alex is definitely one of those.Aside from the crappy mom, Matt is a very good dad and, on top of that, a good person. He is an easily sympathetic and lovable protagonist, but he is seriously sad. As one of the smaller characters simply stated about Matt's situation: ""it really blows,"" before Matt replies: ""I know."" Matt's problems are uniquely sh***y. Not only does he have to deal with telling all his family and friends that his wife is going to die, but he also has to deal with the process of selling what seems to be his last connection to his ancestors and Hawaii itself and to deal with some a**hole who saw his wife without his knowing about it. Matt's weakness is that he tends to go on cruise-control and eventually ends up being unaware of his situation and problems. This movie shows his revelation of those things.I love this movie because it is truly the most realistic piece of the year. It has the full range of effective and inspiring story-telling, acting, cinematography, and true ""vision up the butt so just go with it"" directorial and screen-writing ability from Alexander Payne and his co-writers, Nat Faxon and Jim Rash. Also, not to forget, the brilliant creator of the story and author of the novel, Kaui Hart Hemmings. I know this name only matters if Kaui reads this, which Kaui probably won't, but you never know. Also . . . this film will win the Golden Globe, but I am a little doubtful that it will the votes of the conservative members of the Academy . . . I mean it's competing with a Scorsese flick, a Spielberg epic, and a silent and black and white movie that is actually pretty good. Nevertheless, I know that The Descendants deserves to be dubbed as Best Picture of 2011 and it happens one of my personal favorite films of all time.I highly recommend that you most definitely see this film.",The Descendants
364,hurley_chic182,A touching and incredibly acted film,8,11 February 2012,"This poignant story is simultaneously tragic and comical, a feat not many movies even attempt to claim, and this one nails it. Through the situation and the circumstances surrounding it, we witness Matt's journey through his grief. The character development is so fluid that you don't always notice it until after it's happened.Alexander Payne did a great job directing. As I watch I am so absorbed in the story and characters that I feel that I am witnessing it all happen right in front of me, like I'm a fly on the wall in this moving story. The actors are exceptional for the most part, as though they aren't really acting – which always makes for the most believable characters. Amara Miller who plays Matt's younger daughter Scottie did amazing in her first role. I look forward to seeing her in more movies. The story itself is not amazing. It is rather forgettable; it was a novel first, and probably makes a stronger impact as a book.One of the problems I had with this film is with the character of Matt. Faced with so much we rarely see him vulnerable, and he always is taking the high road, and being the better man. But in the situations he's faced with, I find that pretty inconceivable. Any real person faced with the kinds of revelations he is faced with couldn't be expected to deal with them in such stride. And even though the character wasn't written entirely authentic (in my opinion), George Clooney still did an excellent portrayal – the best role I've seen him play. But I still would give the Oscar to Jean Dujardin for 'The Artist'. But George will probably walk away with the gold anyhow, the Academy loves him, and every year it seems that the Academy Awards are becoming more and more about the politics. Please surprise me this year Academy!Okay, enough of that; back to my review:Will this movie cling to my memories for years? Probably not, but it was interesting to see George Clooney flourish in a different role than he usually takes on. Though the story isn't memorable, it is touching, and there is a good mix of comedic relief that lightens the heavy subject matter nicely.",The Descendants
365,ray-wise,powerful drama..,9,28 January 2012,"A well anticipated film that holds up to every aspect that it was put up to be. This powerful drama stars George Clooney as a man whose wife is in an accident that puts her in a coma - he then is put into a split life of tending to their two rebellious kids and a business decision that could change their lives forever. Shailene Woodley plays a brilliant role as Alex - one of the children, for me she carried the film remarkably well considering this is her first big screen performance. Clooney also plays a good role but I think not Oscar winning, however, we will have to wait and see. The storey is a complete roller-coaster ride of emotion that has a few lighter moments which ease you for a short while but through you back into the turmoil very quickly and without remorse.. This is a gripping and emotional movie from beginning to end and is certainly not your average Hollywood plot - which is good.. Change is good but this even rises about that.. Brilliant.",The Descendants

First few minutes, I was like: ""Okay...family troubles, teenage girls, etc.."" But then the plot started developing and you could actually relate to those characters. In my opinion they were drawn out pretty well - I really liked Matt-George Clooney, his acting was flawless and also Alex-Shailene Woodley was great, she's a pretty young lady...Then her movie friend Sid-Nick Krause was pretty entertaining...It is a story about a father, dealing with his own personal troubles - wife in coma, 10and 17-year-old daughters, earning money for their living,.... As his wife encounters a serious injury, she's in a coma and he has to take care of his girls even though they're tough to handleThis movie made me relaxed, there wasn't any violence which is rare to see these days with all the shooting and killing. I wouldn't recommend it to small children but teenagers+older, it is nice family movie to watch!",The Descendants
367,samlapidus,You want to know the characters,8,12 September 2011,"I had the privileged of attending the World Premier of the film, along with cast, director and a producer, at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). The person I attended with told me that he had read the synopsis and was fearing a depressing film. Well he was wrong. This is a film you want to see and recommend. The characters are lovable. You want to have George Clooney's character on your speed dial labeled as ""Best Friend"". The children/teens, there are three, are talented actors and boost the quality of this production. It doesn't hurt that a film set in Hawaii is quite inviting. You don't always know where the story is going but after scenes are unraveled you are happy that they did present themselves. Rather then depressing, this film is uplifting. You realize that even problems so far from your home are the same all over. Go out, spend a few bucks, see the move, you'll be happy you did.Side note, after the TIFF presentation the director, Alexander Payne, George Clooney and the cast took the stage. It was not surprising that George was absolutely great with the young ones and the comedy continued on stage after the movie. This very quality was evident in George's character in the movie.",The Descendants
368,Ricostar19,George Clooney's most touching movie !,10,3 January 2012,"For weeks I've been dying to see, ""The Descendants"". Ever since I have seen the preview, I had an automatic attachment. So I finally see it today, and it was simply fantastic! Easily one of the greatest movies of the year and the most moving picture I have ever seen. ""The Descendants"" had so much passion and truth; it moved me in such a way that it's even hard to write this review. It's so hard to explain this truly visionary film in words. The movie starts off like any drama; a situation, emotionally damaged characters and a main character with some type of emotional load. The story heads into a comedy for a bit, then completely changes your sight. It slaps you with a troubling secret the husband and main character (GeorgeBs Clooney), finds out about his ailing wife. And he has to to make a decision; how to react to a wife's fault when she can't even move? The whole movie, Clooney is unfairly faced with challenge after challenge and does what most men in his position would not do; the right thing! The journey this family has to take, affects not only Clooney, but his two daughters and the rest of their family. They reconnect while learning the strange power of forgiveness, and knowing when to do the right thing. From the very laughable moments to the points where you can't even bare to look at the screen without crying, this movie is definitely one of the best movies of the year, make that the best movie of this generation.",The Descendants

Everything was right from the word go the Hawaiian music that supported the emotions of the characters brilliantly , the beautiful settings captured magnificently by Alexander Payne he really did bring out the best of the Hawaiian landscape and lifestyle , the original simplistic story and the flawless acting and father daughter relationship by George Clooney and Shailene Woodley.

Nothing weird, eccentric, or funny about him, just a real man living through real life. Showed sadness, vulnerability, and tenderness. Every emotion was felt on screen. The daughters were good too, a little too forced at the beginning but they mellow out and grow on you as the film goes on.I also did enjoyed the background story, a well developed tale of history that reflects the Hawaii we know today. I always enjoy a movie that reaches out and makes you think. Beautiful cinematography and location scouting.",The Descendants
371,christine-dreyer89,Surprisingly heartfelt.,8,29 April 2012,"The Descendants cast a spell over me.I got a thorough inappropriate kick out of it. Inappropriate. Yes, inappropriate. This film was unlike any other film I've ever seen. Alexander Payne (Director and Screenplay writer) presented us with a series of nerve racking anecdotes which left me snickering on the outside, while basically convulsing on the inside! I found this film to be terribly funny. Funny in a way, that I felt kind of guilty for even thinking it was funny. After some reflection (deep), I realized, I laughed because all the characters in The Descendants had to act inappropriately - and they did it so f'n well. This film won the 'Best Writing for an Adapted Screenplay' Oscar and furthermore, was nominated for 4 Academy Awards, which included 'Actor In a Leading Role' for the oh-so-statuesque, GOD - Mr. Clooney.The story revolves around Matthew King (Clooney) and his family. After his wife, Elizabeth (Hastie), ends up in hospital, he is left looking after his two daughters. Scottie (Miller) the youngest, cracked me up. She seemed to express genuine curiosity and ignorance. Honesty. And I just kept on thinking about that one person, we all know one, who asks all the wrong questions, all. the. time. She is relatively new to the acting scene, but I think she did really okay. And then there is other daughter, Alexandra (Woodley). Such a beautiful woman. And in The Descendants, the ultimate dark horse. She seemed to be into all sorts of bad things, she seemed like the ultimate super brat, but I ended up loving her character.Even though King is left with the daunting task of looking after his daughters, he has to run his law practice and oversee plans for the selling of a piece of land which belongs to his extended family and himself. All this while waging war with his own conscience.Adding to the inappropriate feel of this film, comes along, Nick Krause as Sid. He depicts the dude-character, speaking in bumpersticker and generally just being the boy any father would hit over the head with a surfboard. It's like his character was basically just created to annoy Clooney's character, but in the end, I felt he snuggled his way right into King's heart.And finally, the man, George Clooney. The first time one hears him in this film, he introduces us to his 'paradise' and drops the F-bomb. Ha. (And yes, I felt the swearing was appropriate.) He played the 'dad' and 'husband' brilliantly. His franticness, his impulsiveness and his raw emotion streamed from the screen and washed over me. Oh, and might I add, Scooby-Doo's Shaggy (Matthew Lillard) makes an appearance too, which seems weirdly too appropriate seeing as he is so, like, the dude and The Descendants was shot in Hawaii.Well, I must say The Descendants was a pretty funny movie. I loved it. I've seen it twice now and I definitely loved it even more the second time, who knows how the third time will pan out. If you are looking for a surprisingly heartfelt, inappropriate movie, do yourself a favor and get this one.",The Descendants
372,temp-380-702359,Misogynistic Messages Disguised as a Story,1,26 May 2012,"I imagine that the only folks who could relate to a film like this are hostile men who promote a negative view of women. If a female a character is not a somehow a villain whose antagonizing this holier-than-though rich male character, then she is using hateful gender-based name calling to express her anger toward another female. I suspect the writer of this movie script is seething with resentment toward women and hiding behind movie characters as a means to get his woman-hating message across that woman are no good.The two selfish daughter character creations in the story seem to have an absolutely outlandish level of apathy for the circumstance that they discover their mother in. And the father, who also seems not to care about his wife much, seems only to bond with the idiotic socially inept teenage boy character who is depicted in one scene to possess the only wisdom that Clooney's character can find. Basically, here's the theme- man good, woman evil.Do not be fooled by the cover picture or trailer for this film. It is not sentimental, heart warming, or touching in any way. It is about a rich white man who copes with irritating females as he island hops around Hawaii trying to convince himself that he's smarter and of higher social and morale aptitude than those he encounters, both male and female. That existence of the wife character serves no other purpose besides serving as a contrast against which Clooney's character can proudly compare himself and shine brightly.Also there was a real weird scene in the beginning involving a good looking blond male character who, from the writer's perspective, deserved a bad attitude for expressing his empathy to Clooney's character. I didn't get that angle of thought. I think the script writer is a little off in the head and probably has social aptitude issues himself.And to boot, its just dull.",The Descendants
373,redflax,Subtle and real,8,25 August 2015,"I stumbled across this movie. I don't think it is a spoiler to say, pivotal to the story is a death which is dealt with in a realistic way.All throughout the movie the dramatic moments were dealt with softly, the writing and acting were subtle. The other aspect that I found realistic was the interior shots. The movie is set on Hawaii and the homes portrayed in the movie were different from the usual homes created for many movies. They seemed to reflect the place; they were furnished like homes you would find in Hawaii. Also the Hawaiian music track that was played frequently and this made another connection between the theme of ancestors and family's location. I found the unfolding of the individual's characteristics were unexpected. Many seem to begin predictably and then would show a surprising aspect. This was one of the strategies that let the story unfold in a very real and unexpected way. One thing missing for me was the lack of discourse around 'family' and its function. Family and the place it has in the present and the past was the lynch-pin for all of the story lines. While the link with land was included, it seemed to be portrayed without the depth that this connection would have had if these were real people.",The Descendants

375,RichyRichFerguson,*It's What You Make It To Be *,7,8 March 2017,"George Clooney once again comes forward with a solid performance, running right out of the gate; whether that be his overall performance and memorable mono-logging, or the physical running he commits to doing in his shaggy flip flops across the street. The movie overall is a solid representation of self-interest and what it means to truly put what you hold dear, first. Across the board, everyone comes off solidly, and commits themselves to the quirky interpretations of self that they want to embody, but the children really commit themselves the most to being the stand out performances. Shailene Woodley provides a deep and emotionally satisfying character that gravitates the bridge between personal sanity and teen angst in a lovely little bottle, whilst giving enough to the audience to soak up and still love about her. Having her as a sister in real life would be nothing less than a treat. The story itself is not exactly as sunny in tone as the setting itself appears to be, and although it comes off slightly predictable around the latter end of the film, the predictability does not seem to hold the focus of attention. What you will grasp a hold of is the intriguing and fresh story of a family burdened with something that seems greater than themselves, but somehow they take the struggle and pain that it weighs on them, and they try their best to make the most of it. Overall the story does not lack much real appeal other than maybe the surfer ""boyfriend"" and some personal 'nit picks'. All in all, the movie holds well and deserves a solid 78/100. -Rounded down for IMDb. (7/10)-",The Descendants

Wth all the tear jerking with no real breaks after the Mother's fate is decided the movie is just one long Train wreck in extremely slow motion.

377,soccin,What is he going to do next?,9,20 December 2011,"I watch movies as a sociologist of cinema. My primary interests lie neither in the artistic qualities of a film, nor in the craftsmanship of the acting, direction, writing, or other aspects of the film's production. These are not unimportant to me, but what I care about most of all is the film's story and its depiction of human action and interaction. On this basis I rate ""The Descendants"" a fine movie. Not a perfect movie, not even a flawed masterpiece, but a fine movie nonetheless. I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since I watched it a few days ago. Not many films affect me that way.""The Descendants"" is a highly understated film. True, it is regularly punctuated by moments of intense pathos -- Payne allows many of the film's main characters (and a few of the minor ones) to have their emotive close-up moments -- but I found myself unmoved by any of them. However, I didn't see this as a problem; somehow it didn't bother me that I remained aloof from all the drama. What kept me engaged from the beginning to the ending was one central question: ""What is he going to do next?"" And the film never failed to deliver an engaging and provocative answer to that question.At the beginning of the movie we meet Matt King, an affluent and affable character, to be sure, but more ""reactor"" than ""actor"" in his life. He lets his wife parent (sort of) their two children, he lets ""the cousins"" lead him, as the sole trustee of the family's real estate holdings, to a necessary decision about a land transaction, and on a bigger scale, he lets his routine work as a lawyer substitute for intimacy with his family -- he is completely blindsided by his daughter's revelation that his wife was cheating on him before a boating accident puts her in a coma.Throughout the rest of the movie, we get to see Matt reckon with one decision after another. Virtually all of these decisions are put in motion through circumstances he has inherited. In this sense ""The Descendants"" is an appropriate title for the film. Like all of us, Matt King inherits a social situation largely not of his own choosing, but then he must actively choose what to do about it. How will he handle his difficult daughters? What should he do about his older daughter's new companion? When and how will he talk to his younger daughter about her mother? What will he do with the revelation about his wife's infidelity? Will he confront his wife's lover? Will he make trouble for that other man's wife and kids? How should he respond to disturbing new information about the land deal? And so forth. Not every decision is life-altering, but one by one they disclose the depth of Matt King's character. He turns out to be in possession of more nobility and grace than we are initially led to believe. Perhaps more than even he believed about himself. He's still human, but he's fundamentally a good guy trying to do the right thing the best way he knows how.Curiously, the story relies on a legal mechanism to compel Matt to take action in both major story lines: a law forcing the trust to be dissolved within a particular time frame, and his wife's legally binding advanced directive requiring that she be removed from life support. He can't not act. This forces him to learn how to do what he's been able to avoid doing up until that point. And the more practice he has at it, the more he realizes that he can do it -- indeed, that he must do it if he wants to truly live his life. There are a couple of surprises and twists along the way, but nothing earth-shattering. It's not that kind of a film. It makes its point quietly, subtly, underwhelmingly.Early on in the story Matt explains to the audience why he chose to live off his own income rather than off his inheritance. He says something to the effect of, ""You want to give your kids enough for them to do something with their lives, but not so much that they do nothing with their lives."" It appears that that was good advice. Like Matt himself, his daughters rise to the occasion when tested by trial. The closing scene is full of hope and promise of new beginnings as a family truly united.Payne appears to follow that same advice regarding his audience. I've read a lot of reviews that describe this film as a melodrama or ""soap opera."" I disagree, and I never would have drawn that conclusion on my own. Payne gives his viewers enough to do something, but not so much that we do nothing but wallow in the tragedy. There's no tragedy here, just real life. What are you going to do next?",The Descendants
378,deepakincredible,An emotional and pleasant ride,9,27 January 2012,"Just seeing the movie's stills would give you a fair idea of what to expect from the movie.The story is about how a middle aged man gets in term with his daughters and his own emotions when his wife is in coma and could die in a week. Though this is not a story that would make everyone rush to the theaters, the treatment given to the story gets you glued to the seat throughout the movie and applaud at the end.Performances : George Clooney pulls out an excellent performance for which he will be remembered for. This is a role where there is so much scope for overacting or even under-acting. George has done a great job in not doing any of the above and do what a person who is in the situation will actually do. Shailene Woodley's performance is notable. Her expressions and body language are perfect for the role and of course, she is cute :) All the other actors also did their job perfectly.Screenplay, direction : Given the storyline, there is plenty of chance this movie could have been a complete bore. But Alexander Payne has given a great treatment to the movie that there you don't see your watch even once during the movie. Lots of humorous one-liners that are perfectly placed make sure that there is not a single dull moment in the movie.Cinematography, art and other technicalities : The locations are very pleasant. There are lots of metaphors out there for artistic movie lovers. Cameraman has got everything right from capturing the beauty of the locations to capturing the emotions of actors.The background music is good. But could have been better. Other than that, this is a movie that will linger in your mind for many days after you watch it.",The Descendants
379,ronin_warrior,"Pretty decent for watching once, but with forced emotions and mostly pointless",6,5 January 2013,"When I saw that Blu-Ray at the shop and read ""George Clooney"" my first thought was - that's going to be a great movie. Well, after watching it I can say it was a fairly decent one after all. Some very beautiful landscape visuals, too.But there are many missed opportunities for some touching scenes. Like when Alexandra grabs that cell phone, just like her willful mother, when there's a call from the real estate agency, before her father is able to stop her, and does his job talking instead of him. No emotion on his face. Or like when she tells him about discovering that her mother was cheating on him, sitting on the couch, then breaking into tears. He does nothing just standing around, when he could just sit down beside and comfort her like any loving father would be expected to. Or like when Alexandra's friend Sid is speaking bad of his wife while they're driving. Matt abruptly stops his car and all he's able to bring out at Cid is pointing a threatening finger and just sitting there afterwards as if lost in place, instead of throwing him out of the car which would be the sensible thing to do. Or or or, this could go on.Speaking of which, I didn't really get it why that half-witted Sid had to be tagging along through the entire movie with his insolent grin and nothing meaningful to say. No sane father would be able to tolerate someone like him around for long, even being as clueless as Clooney playing one. Sid pretty much seemed to be out of place everywhere they went, making me wish Matt would throw him out already. Instead he is chatting with him and actually asking, of all people, the light-headed boy for advice on how to handle his own daughters. I guess there's nothing more to say after that.It's clearly visible George is trying hard to get those emotions pushed out, in some of the scenes almost looking as if pushing (forgive me the comparison) with all his strength to give birth to a baby which isn't there in the first place. As that, there's lack of natural emotions on screen, (one notable exception being Shailene Woodley who I think was great playing his older daughter Alexandra) which is why the movie mostly left me with a feeling of dissatisfaction. Overall, it's a pleasant, well-done, but mostly forgettable movie, not one I'm going to be watching another time again. What it lacks is that special highs and lows which would make something really excellent out of it. There's mostly just dull melancholy dragging on throughout the movie. The same monotone guitar music playing all the time didn't help much either. It did resolve everything just before the end credits though, when a heart-warming sequence showed an image of the father and his two daughters being one family whole again.",The Descendants
380,NoEarthlyReason,Sensitive and moving US film,8,3 October 2012,"(A 35-year-old British man writes): I enjoyed it. It's sensitive and moving, and not too over-sentimental or traumatically heart- wrenching. Also, I found the plot easy to follow. It was nice to have an idyllic, sun-shining background to explore the bereavement, infidelity and parenting issues, and the proportion of lighter moments was about right. The beaches and land further back from the coast looked very enticing. I would tend to hope (in the context of the film's plot, not necessarily real life) that the authorities could make that land a state or national park. Another friend advised me that George Clooney is ""almost believable"", because his George Clooney-ness makes him so difficult to see as someone other than himself. This is a good description of him in all of the films in which I can remember him featuring, and is meant as a compliment to his acting ability. If I have one small criticism, it would be that there were moments when the humour (if that's what it was intended to be) seemed out of place or inappropriate, like when Clooney's character was running down the road in flip-flops after being told about his wife's affair. I laughed out loud though when the grandfather hit the elder daughter's idiotic boyfriend—classic comic timing. If anyone rents or buys the DVD (I don't know if this applies to versions outside Britain or Europe), the only special feature worth watching is the third, ""Casting"". The other two can be summed up as, respectively, ""Isn't George Clooney just wonderful (sighhhhh)?"", and ""Isn't the director just wonderful?"" Both sent me into an irritated torpor.",The Descendants
381,sfuller228-55-885075,George Clooney As The Ultimate Mensch,9,20 February 2012,"The Descendants was a pleasant surprise. As a series of character studies, the cast rises above what could have been a fairly pedestrian tale of loss and discovery (in other words, the movie that you expect to see after viewing the trailer). George Clooney plays a fellow (Matt King) trying his best to be a nice guy in the face of conflict. His portrayal as a man trapped between doing the right thing and the thing he wants to do is the central theme of the movie played out against the backdrops of business, family and death. The supporting cast was excellent as a collection of family and friends caught in much of the same dilemma as Matt, but coming to terms with it in far different ways. Special mention to the ever interesting Robert Forster and Beau Bridges (and those decadent eyebrows).A special word about the King family. The trailer would leave us to believe that the two children are spoiled rotten offspring. In fact, they love their father and rally to his support when needed. Even the elder daughter's stoner boyfriend ends up as an important aspect of Matt's trip to resolve his ""dilemma"".Finally, a word about George Clooney's award-nominated performance. Mr. Clooney is that odd kind of actor that everyone knows gives good performances, but that is probably discounted because he is a bit too cute. Perhaps that is why we're so comfortable with him blowing things up and being a tongue-in-cheek tough guy in the movies. In this film, he showed the torment and conflict of his character clearly and simply, without flourish and flash and the result was satisfying in the extreme.",The Descendants
382,tmp93828,Certainly one of the year's best,9,19 January 2012,"My only regret about this movie is that it took me this long to see it. The Descendants, is one of those films that fully succeeds at what it is trying to accomplish. George Clooney fully engulfs himself into the character of Matt King, and his emotional range sways from moments of pure pleasure to those of betrayal and discomfort. Clooney's spectacular and award winning performance is only outdone by Alexander Payne's ability to portray a beautiful slice of heaven in Hawaii while at the same time breaking the viewers heart with devastating character developments and scenes that will undoubtedly have an emotionally conscious viewer on the verge of tears. Even the brief supporting roles of Beau Bridges, Matthew Lilliard, and Judy Greer feel so real and intense that at times it felt like I wasn't watching a film at all, but rather the lives of several individuals in some of their most vulnerable moments. To put it simply, Clooney gives a knockout performance and the Descendants is surely one the most outstanding films of the year. If I had to choose one, this would have to be my choice for the Best Picture of 2011. A+",The Descendants

At the end of it I came away richer, thinking about human life and relationships, histories, responsibilities and 'fragilities'. Payne does it with a disarming, refined and mature ease, never letting go of you as an audience - its like listening to a good trusting friend you love hearing from. That is indeed a directorial achievement. Clooney we know is a capable actor, and in this film, he shines and yes he made me shed a tear.Put this in the backdrop of the essential elements of ocean (water) mountain (earth) , breeze (air) and ashes (fire) of Hawaii and you will love your family as only you can.Payne and Clooney, take a splendid bow!(Prolonged Applause)",The Descendants
384,BookSplotReviews,Loved Shailene Woodley and George Clooney,9,29 March 2012,"I'll be the first to admit that after seeing a few episodes of The Secret Life of the American Teenager I wasn't quite sure about all of the praise Shailene Woodley was getting for The Descendants. Nothing against her, really. I just see the show as incredibly melodramatic (maybe I haven't seen enough) and not of the same caliber as what they were talking about with The Descendants.After seeing The Descendants, though, I can say that regardless of what I think about Woodley in Secret Life, she's amazing in the film. Pretty much everyone is, actually.The Descendants, stars George Clooney as Matt King a Hawaiian lawyer - and land owner - who's wife is in a coma and on life support after a boating accident. It takes his teenage daughter, Alexandra (played by Woodley) to bring to his attention that his wife was having an affair.Alexandra, the troubled older daughter, has been away at boarding school, but King doesn't seem to know much more about his ten-year-old daughter Scottie's life, either. As he attempts to repair his relationship with his daughters, he also has to cope with the possibility that his wife may not wake up from her coma.All of that sounds dark and hard to deal with, but The Descendants is incredibly funny. And not inappropriately so, either. It's brilliant in dealing with this flawed (almost, at times, non-existent) parental relationship Clooney's character has with his daughters.What's also fantastic is that George Clooney looks tired and a little worn out. Right? Who would ever think George Clooney looking tired would be a good thing but it is. He doesn't have his classic, handsome, movie star look throughout this movie and it's what's needed for this character. He's a guy trying to deal with his two daughters (that he does not know how to deal with) and figure out what's happening with his dying wife. He does not need to look rested and refreshed.The Descendants is based on the novel of the same name by Kaui Hart Hemmings and while I wasn't sure about wanting to read the book before I saw the movie, I very much do now. (Something that very, very rarely happens.)This is a movie I absolutely recommend!",The Descendants
385,For_the_love_of_cinema,As real as it gets,8,18 April 2012,"'The Descendants', based on the novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings, focuses on Matt King (George Clooney), a lawyer, who has to cope with the turmoil caused as his wife, Elizabeth, is in a coma, following an accident. There is also his teenage daughter, Alex 's (Shailene Woodley) defiance, his 10 year old daughter, Scotty's (Amara Miller) improper behavior and a decision about selling a family-owned 25,000 acres piece of land of which he is the sole trustee. And all this happens in beautiful, breathtaking Hawaii. Matt is a committed lawyer who wasn't always there for his wife and daughters. As such, he is forced to re-examine his life after his wife's accident. But is it too late to make up for things? The film's serious subject-matter is balanced with comical moments provided mainly by Alex's friend, Sid. Clooney delivers a masterful performance as a father who is trying so hard to deal with the various aspects of his life turned upside down. Special mention to Woodley, whose portrayal of a rebellious teenage daughter could not have been more believable. And that's exactly what the film is – believable, real and emotional.Zero melodrama, just the right amount of humor, a fine screenplay and the raw performances all make this Oscar-winning film worth watching. Watch the movie to reflect on the intricacies of life, to appreciate good filmmaking and to realize just what emotions a movie can make you feel. What Matt King as well as his daughters seek for in 'The Descendants' is closure. Do they get it? You'll have to watch the movie to find out.Bottomline:'The Descendants' is a wonderful portrayal of real life, pieced together beautifully and acted out impeccably.",The Descendants
386,yasinkozak,A SPLENDID REFLECTION OF A DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY,7,6 March 2019,"The Descendants welcome those cinephiles who are looking for a cosy, friendly dysfunctional family drama. A land baron, rich father who is often too busy to deal with his wife, Elizabeth, and two daughters Scotty and Alex, finds himself in a difficult situation when Elizabeth ends up in a coma after an accident.Actually, the father, George Clooney, comes on the stage as the narrator in the beginning of the movie and he talks about how it is hard for him to be a role-model parent for his two daughters, especially the youngest one. Alex, the elder daughter, first seems such a problematic teenager then makes peace with the father and helps his father out taking care of her little sister is portrayed perfectly by Shailane Woodley. IN the end, when the mother dies, they are all alone and end up eating junks watching TV at home. However, they are in peace. We come to conclusion that losing a parent or a spouse may cause the rest of the family become closer and share more time one another.
The movie has its witty scenes and it has a great dramatic atmosphere, which you can figure out while the storyline flows. George Clooney, who is hot but quite my tempo, presents a great performance in that role. Shailane Woodley is shining although I couldn't figure out why she is wearing bikini on the boat they are spreading her mothers ashes on the ocean whereas the other two are wearing t-shirts!

There was too much teenage cussing that annoyed me, although it added characteristics. The movie had a good idea in place but didn't execute well. I did like the part where he chooses not to sell the land his family owns, it showed change in the character. This movie also had good characterization.

I liked especially the change in Clooney's attitude towards Sid once he realises that his initial assessment was superficial and wrong because it is something that happens so often in real life between parents and boy or girlfriend of their adolescent children.The film could have done with less insistence on the Hawaiian scenery, beautiful as it is - at times too much travelogue but that's just my feeling.",The Descendants

Treats big themes in such a first person, personal way that you feel the full stretch of Clooney's emotional range almost to breaking point.

393,husker80,Paine's latest descends into predictability,7,26 November 2011,"I'm definitely in the minority here, and probably could be called ungrateful since I went to a free preview showing in Alexander Payne's hometown that he was gracious enough to attend. But ""The Descendants,"" for me, was just too, too predictable to be enjoyable.Let me qualify that first. The one thing that was NOT predictable was not being allowed some time with the comatose-then-expired ex-wife. She's in the opening scene enjoying a boat ride with no speaking role; after that she's a veg in a bed. Having no idea of who she is, other than a cheating wife and not that great a mom, I have a hard time seeing how anyone busts a tear when she does die.But I kind of had the impression Payne wanted a tearjerker; that's what my wife was expecting and didn't get it. I was expecting a comedy and didn't really get it, either (although a handful of people at the showing laughed aloud at some seeming inappropriate scenes). Not having tears and laughs in the way, I was able to focus on the story... and I didn't find anything really new here. The dilemma for the Clooney character was to sell the family's land for a lot of a money or a hell of a lot of money - as soon as the daughter reminisced about camping there, you thought ""Oh, he CAN'T sell it."" As soon as you found out his wife's lover would make the commission, you thought ""Oh, he WON'T sell it."" An hour later, he didn't.Clooney is playing the same character he played in ""Michael Clayton"" and ""Up in the Air"" (and with the same range of emotions), that of an ""average"" man with enormous pressures put upon him without looking for them but ultimately and always doing the ""right thing."" I've seen it before with him, I saw it here and I expect I'll see it again.The children were predictable as well. There's always a precocious younger sibling who always seems to get in their share of swearing. There's always a ""problem child"" who's been sent away, but once they get out there's a realization that they really have it all together. Again, cookie-cutter characters. I've never seen ""Citizen Ruth,"" but similar to ""Election,"" ""About Schmidt"" and ""Sideways,"" there's an element of infidelity in ""The Descendents"" again. It's become predictable for Payne's films to have it, and - as expected - the victim of the infidelity is the last to know.As being land-locked in Omaha, one thing I did find interesting is the side of Hawaii that you don't usually see on TV or in films. Payne always does a good job of incorporating the local fabric, however.I did follow the story and it was well-told, but I have to admit to checking my watch as it seemed to stretch out. Had high expectations but I have to say this is my least favorite of Payne's. I look forward to his next, which he says will be set in Nebraska, but I hope it's something new and noteworthy.",The Descendants

I found nothing redeemable about any part of it. In no part of the story did I feel empathy, even for the woman lying on the bed dying. Perhaps there were a few words slung about attesting to her character, but most of the accolades were given by her father who appeared to be in complete denial. He seemed to truly not know his daughter at all. I usually can find something redeemable about a movie somewhere. Not this. I did not care what happened to a single person in the story.

We're so inundated with unnecessary violence,foul language and sex scenes in movies these days that it made a wonderful change to view a film which explored the lives of people, ordinary people who could have been my neighbours or family.This is a great ensemble cast with every member turning in an understated, considered and nuanced performance just right for each character. As with life, this film contains sadness, comedy, frustration, patience, wisdom, stupidity, greed, generosity, revenge, jealousy,graciousness, empathy and grief. The characters feel very real with all the merits and flaws of real people. Each one is allowed to develop a roundness of personality too often missing in modern films. This is not a fast paced movie but a gentle journey through the complexities of family relationships, in life and death.If you're a fan of hard-hitting action films then this isn't for you but if you enjoy merging with a film's characters as the tapestry of life is revealed, then you'll love this movie. I can't wait to see it again. And again!",The Descendants
405,kwhitehead33,My favorite of the Oscar nominees for BP ...,9,25 February 2012,"By favorite I mean the film I most see myself watching again out of the Best Picture nominees. The best film that I saw in 2011 (or 2012 at the end of the Oscar season) was the Artist. That should, and probably will, win Best Picture. I think that George Clooney should take Best Actor though. It's 1 and 1A as far as I'm concerned, Jean Dujardin was phenomenal, but I think, and we're splitting hairs here, he was helped by both the uniqueness of the film and Berenice Bejo who is for lack of a better word, radiant, in that film. Clooney carries this film from start to finish. His performance is understated, funny, real. Overall, this film has fantastic performances by an ensemble cast including Nick Krause, who is great as Sid. I didn't feel that anything seemed forced (save maybe Speer's wife appearing in the end), although it addressed subject matter that could lend itself easily to being forced. I think Clooney deserves to pull an upset, in my opinion perhaps his best performance in an already stellar career. Regardless, this is a wonderful film that had me hooked from the very first scene. I would highly recommend it.",The Descendants
406,nite-fighter,Why was this movie made?,2,22 July 2017,"So George Clooney plays a husband who hasn't paid attention to his family in years, so far that he states he hasn't taken care of his own daughter alone since she was 3. Of course he sees the errors of his ways only after his wife is in a terrible accident and ends up in a coma, from which she is not going to wake up.But then, surprise, he finds out she had a lover and man, why would she do that? I mean he has been an absent, distant, constantly working partner, how dare his wife find someone else who pays attention to her! (btw, sarcasm) Now his quest becomes to find this man, I mean he could take care of his children, figure out how to be a father, say goodbye to his wife, but no, he is gonna find his wife's lover. There is also a bit of plot about a land selling deal and George Clooney's character standing up to his family (cousins?) and not selling, the land, i don't know why that was in there.Also Scotty: was he supposed to the comedic relief? Was he supposed to be funny? Why is he there?",The Descendants
407,realtor1018,A Masterpiece,10,26 November 2012,"Every so often a film comes around that stays with you long after the credits roll and lights come up. The Descendants is such a film. A woman is severely injured in a boating accident and her somewhat distant husband is left trying to figure things out. Writer director Alexander Payne, has written such a deep and profound story that it will draw you in without you even knowing it. George Clooney in the role that may be his best ever is a man who struggles to make sense of his life and the relationships that he has to begin to nurture is just brilliant here. Writer, director Alexander Payne takes long breaks in between his films, his last being the equally brilliant Sideways . The Descendants is at times heartbreaking and equally funny. It is a rare honest film that no one should miss. Every performer shines in this film from the smallest part to supporting cast. Veteran actor Robert foster in particular is heartbreaking as Clooney's father in law, torn with bitterness and extreme sadness at the pending death of his daughter. The musical score by several Hawaiian artist is just a perfect companion to this great film",The Descendants

It has also made George Clooney my favorite actor. It's a heartwarming movie for those who like some comedy, and parenting and marriage faults mixed in with their dramas. George Clooney is at his best in this film, and so is Shailene Woodley, they both play amazing characters and it's just so great how... 'human', or 'real life' they are. There is a bit of cussing, and a lot of talk about an affair. I think this would be a great movie to sit down and watch with your high school aged kid(s).

This movie did not insult my intelligence and everything that happened in it made sense. George Clooney is one of my favorite actors and the young ladies playing his daughters were a revelation.

Touching, human and every performance was extraordinary. Robert Forster was Oscar worthy in his small role of two breathtaking scenes, the young first time actor that plays Clooney's daughter's friend brought me to tears, and Judy Greer was amazing.

413,goddolove,An Idealistic Approach to a Realistic Family,10,17 April 2012,"Some of the most common problems dealt with by the average American family are at play in this film, and they are portrayed in a surprisingly honest light. Nothing too over the top, nothing sugarcoated, and just enough believable plot to keep the interpersonal dynamics in play...In real life, a family as problematic as this one is usually stuck on a path in which all members are slowly but surely gaining distance from each other. In the movie, we see this start to change as the father figure patiently abides in his loving care for his daughters, a responsibility he now must face alone, with his wife on the edge of death throughout the film. Even though he is helpless against the forces working against him, his timid love is shown in many ways to be the catalyzing factor towards the positive changes that take place in his family. By the end of the film, you might even say his love has become steadfast and courageous, although this might contradict the genuinely humble disposition he has come to inhabit.Far too often we see realistic depictions of problems in families leading to partisan relationships between the adults and the children, as if any problematic situation automatically entails that both parties be pitted against each, in a cosmic battle akin to that of good versus evil, until one or the other finally submits under the pressure. That cathartic moment usually comes at the end of most movies, whereas in this film, the responsibility of a good example is placed in the hands of the father figure, and he doesn't resort to frustration every time his children show disrespect. Unfortunately, it seems that a present, patient, and loving leader of a family is far too much to ask for in today's ""busy society,"" a society rationalized by our rampant materialism. Fortunately, this movie seems to be doing a good job of arguing that it's not too much to ask.",The Descendants

419,rahulwane,George-ous yet a Payneful Triumph!,9,25 January 2012,"The Descendants is a movie that I was anticipating from quite a very long time mainly because of its critical acclaim at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival. As it was expected, the movie lives up to the expectations and at times manages to surpass it too. First of all, it's all and all a total George Clooney movie. In each and every scene you will see Clooney unleashing his acting prowess (FYI I've never seen him perform so flawlessly before). To put it in more simplistic and a conventional way, The Descendants is basically a Family drama centered around Matt king, a land baron from Hawaii who tries to reconnect with his two daughters after his wife suffers a tragic boating accident and goes into comatose. This, as you can see a serious situation but the director Alexander Payne adroitly manages to put a touch of humor into it and the final product is nothing less than a masterpiece. The Descendants features an outstanding cast, each of whom has their stand-out moment. Clooney makes Matt King a personable, perplexed, thoughtful yet an imperfect leading man, and he does some of his best work without a dialog. Apart from him, the beautiful Shailene Woodley is extraordinarily effective as his belligerent teenage daughter, wary of her absentee father's sudden involvement in her life and bitterly angry towards her mother. What ties it all together is the movie's magnificent script, which seamlessly blends comedy and drama. OVERALLIf you have a hunger for great acting, The Descendants is a feast. Led by George Clooney in the most immaculate performance of his career, it manages to strike that rare balance between funny and heart-breaking. Emotional indulgences aside, The Descendants resonates deeply. It has that rare fusion of amazing direction (Hats off to Alexander Payne) and sensational performances. Undoubtedly, one of the best of 2011. Do not miss this top quality cinema which is seldom made these days. Highly Recommended!",The Descendants

Honestly I went to see this movie with my entire family and we were all well aware that it was a piece of trash after seeing it. The movie centers around a group of characters so forgettable and weak that you will wish you could have gotten your money back. The only entertaining scenes in this movie where the occasional nature vistas presented in short cuts between melodramatic family dysfunction. Every single time Alexandra, the teenage girl speaks, you can predict a meaningless flurry of rebellion and profanity to erupt from her mouth. The acting is simply terrible, with George Clooney playing an awfully shallow and unlikable character. Honestly I don't understand why he bothered with this movie.",The Descendants
421,gweiss27,"Honestly, Pretty Boring",2,19 February 2012,"This movie was the first I've ever seen where, during the movie, I actually was so bored, I felt like MAKING the movie must be boring. I actually pictured the people on set listening to Payne's direction and staring at the walls, wishing he would be quiet, and thinking that no one could possibly give a damn about anything about this story.Obviously, I didn't get it at all (like most of his movies). He's the type of director, where I look at this portfolio of work and think, who would ever want to get into making movies about THESE topics. So, full disclosure, I'm not a Payne fan, and at least 50% of movies made to depict life as art and the experience of life are not really for me. But many movies of that type do touch me deeply and I get them. I totally get Lost In Translation, where many people most likely felt the way I feel about The Descendants. There's a way to take a great, fundamental, underlying idea, and communicate it through a careful, human, emotional, or even stoic way, that can captivate and resonate with an audience long after the movie is over. That is not the case here. So little of the back-story is developed that it seems impossible to me to bond emotionally to any of the events in the story. I've heard people tell me that much of magic of the storyline is the revealing of the true existence that is Hawaiian life (and not the sitting on a beach, not a care in the world, perfect weather depictions). How is that magic? I lived in South Florida for 10 years, my family still lives there. I live in Southern California now. Such a concept is probably not all that revolutionary to most people. Every place has a reality day to day culture aside from any of the perceptions of visitors and temporarily tourists. This is not a novel concept (to me anyway).Maybe you will see what other people see in this film, because I surely don't.",The Descendants

There are a few (very few) funny moments. The trailers do not show the mom in a boating accident going into a coma and everyone having to deal with the outcome. It is made harder when it quickly shows she was not a saint. This is a depressing movie that moves at a very slow pace. There are a couple side plots.

424,maryparkolap,SO much potential.,4,24 December 2011,"I try not to go into movies with expectations, but I must admit- I was quite excited to see what this film had to offer after having read positive reviews and hints of Oscar nods. Over all, I was disappointed. This film contained such emotionally rich themes and circumstances, but rarely if ever allowed them to play out to their extraordinary potential. There were scenes that had the potential to develop into deeply emotional and touching moments, but something was always missing, and the scene would fall short. Shailene Woodley, playing the eldest daughter, gave a wonderful performance. For me, she was one of the more realistic teenage girls depicted in Hollywood today. Her male friend, on the other hand, was the exact opposite. I can only assume that his character was meant for comic relief, but he really had to opposite effect. But even his character had potential that went unrealized. The conversation between him and George Clooney at night on vacation provided a HUGE opportunity to show depth of character for this young man-- but there was no smooth direction of conversation to allow the two men to express themselves in any relatable way. The storyline follows the emotional journey of Clooney and his immediate family, as well as the extended family's decision to sell it's large property in Hawaii. The ultimate decision for the family to keep their property seemed nearly irrelevant at the end, it could have been incorporated to a more accessible concept that could be related back to the family's emotional struggle. Overall, the two story lines seemed detached, and could have easily been further connected to reinforce each other's importance. All in all, it was a entertaining film. Very, very interesting premise, I only wish it would have further explored some of the emotional intricacies that each character had the potential to portray.",The Descendants
425,babydoll1996,"A brilliant, heartbreaking ""Coming of age"" story",9,9 February 2012,"I haven't seen such an marvelous film ever since the DVD release of ""Trust"", and before I ever got to watch this flick, I didn't exactly know what to expect, since I hadn't previously seen any movies directed by Alexander Payne, but when I did sit down and watched it, I honestly didn't regret it.The Descendants is based on the book of the same name by Kaui Hart Hemmings, retelling the story of Matt King (George Clooney. E.R, Up in the Air), a lawyer and sole trustee of a family trust, who is struggles to cope with his wife's boating accident that has led her to comatose, when at the same time, he tries to rebuild his bond with his daughters, the troubled, rebellious 17 year-old Alex (Shailene Woodley. The Secret Life on the American Teenager, and the spunky, but confused 10 year-old Scottie (newcomer Amara Miller).While quite interesting to watch, The Descendants isn't a movie for everyone. Being emotionally prepared to view this heartbreaking and touching drama that captures perfectly the exact emotions of loss, betrayal and pain, learning to re-connect with the other one, supporting each other with love.Clooney's Matt King may be his most remarkable, outstanding performance, as this is not the kind of role that most are used of seeing him in, being an extremely mature role for him, very far away from the playboys, the rich business men and such. In the film, his performance is not only realistic, but remarkable, capturing the exact feelings of King's coping. This is probably one of his strongest roles, alongside with his work in ""Up in the Air"".On the other hand, Woodley's performance catches the eyes of viewers, along with almost completely stealing the movie away from her co-star Clooney. It is actually quite surprising and shocking that her role as Alex is her first film work, and probably will be one of her strongest in her career, even though she is mostly known from her experience in TV shows, such as The Secret Life of the American Teenager and The O.C. She still gets more than one scene show the many sides of Alex, proving she has the exact amount of charm and dread to make her character beyond believable and beautiful. She may be so much younger than Clooney, but their chemistry is truly amazing.Probably being one of the best movies premiered in 2011, The Descendants does not only show a heartbreaking, incredibly realistic story, but amazingly outstanding performances from all the cast and an excellent direction by Payne. If there is something I'm certainly sure of, is that the flick perfectly deserves the well earned wind and nominations.",The Descendants

The obvious choice was the descendants... Or was it? I had heard nothing about the film before sitting down to watch it, open minded I watched the trailers and then the beautiful opening shots of scenery... Then Clooney's voice over kicked in. Essentially it only goes down hill from there as cliché'd character after cliché'd character crawl out of the woodwork, Clooney himself doing an admirable impression of someone who is quite frankly emotionally retarded and completely transparent as an actor.I can't even remember his characters name, I was completely aware the entire way through the film that it was George Clooney, not his character, bumbling around in Hawaii for almost 2 hours. (It felt like days) I have never found it harder to empathise with a ""character"" as much as the one Clooney attempts to play in this film. I didn't care about him at all, in fact I just wanted his wife to hurry up and die, so that I could leave, having never walked out of a film in my life. George aside, the dialogue was generally awful and Clooney was supported by a wide array of poorly fleshed out and stereotypical characters, none as bad as ""Sid"". The 2d performances of all the actors were thrown together in such a bizarre way that it made the entire film resemble some sort make shift scaffolding leading nowhere and with no real purpose, that teetered on the brink of collapse at any given moment.

427,ansar333,The best emotional realistic family movie,10,12 February 2012,"The thing that makes the movie so amazing is how refreshingly human it is as a whole. Every character is so flawed, in the sense that makes every one of us human. It is very real and you can relate to it. With the highs and lows, the good days and the bad days, it is a wonderful family movie which simply comes as a puzzle with few missing pieces. The characters in the movie are extremely relatable and everyone is exposed in a way that makes you feel you are a part of the family. But who's family is'not it??Matt King (George Clooney) is your average father living in Hawaii who never had to fill his position as a father in his entire life. His wife is recently put into a coma after a freak boat accident and so he had to take this responsibility of taking care of his 2 daughters. And on top of this, clooney is facing pressure from his cousins to sell some property that his family has owned for centuries to construct some big resort. In the beginning Clooney comments on how Hawaii is not a paradise and people living on this island do have problems like us who lives in God's own country. As the film progresses it becomes a treat to see how Clooney own his role while going through all these situations and handle them well. His character is so mature and well etched. We will witness him trying to hold his family together but barely keeping a grip on himself. Every conversation and interaction is done in such a way that you may not be able to predict what he will do next. And the scene where he runs a few blocks in sandals is one of my favorite scene . Shailene Woodley, who plays his daughter's role really delivers in every scene she is in. The underwater crying scene after knowing her mom's critical condition marks my another favorite scene. The shock, deep hurt, tearseverything was included in it, that scene is something hard to swallow without feeling an emotional punch to the chest. The younger daughter too did a great job, the scene were she breaks down after hearing that her mom is going to die show cases the kids acting skills. Another best part of the movie is the background music, it is so soothing to ear. And the scenery too is great.There is so much emotion and humor in the movie which is truly necessary to convey the message. It is better to jump into the film and go along with the family without knowing what would be the next thing that life throws their way. Although the tears may sneak up on you, the laughter and smiles will help you recover it. It's a movie of a normal man who is just having a bad month and comes out of it as a better man. It's an entertaining film depending on your definition of entertainment. And it really shows how precious life is.So Leave everyday you're alive :)",The Descendants

His last film before this one was Sideways, which was a hit with critics and audiences alike. It certainly didn't take Alexander seven years to make The Descendants. During that period, I'm not sure what happened to him. Well enough about the director, since you're here to read the review for this film in itself. The Descendants, which is based on a pretty unknown novel of the same name, is about a man named Matt King trying to re-connect his family. That all changes when he finds out that his wife, who was supposedly injured and in a coma in a boating accident, was really cheating on him. I don't want to spoil much more than that so you can enjoy this film if you go see it. I saw this at the Telluride Film Festival and was blown away. It is better than Sideways, and excellent comedy-drama. Oscars? Absolutely. It is easily one of the years best films, and a major Oscar contender.

429,TasticFilm,"Matt King (George Clooney), a husband and father of two girls, must re-examine his past and navigate his future when his wife is in a boating accident off Waikiki.",10,6 January 2012,"From Alexander Payne, the creator of the Oscar®-winning SIDEWAYS, THE DESCENDANTS is set in Hawaii and follows the unpredictable journey of an American family at a crossroads. Matt King (George Clooney), a husband and father of two girls, must re-examine his past and navigate his future when his wife is in a boating accident off Waikiki. He awkwardly attempts to repair his relationship with his daughters - 10 year-old precocious Scottie (Amara Miller) and rebellious 17 year-old Alexandra (Shailene Woodley) - while wrestling with a decision to sell his family's land. Handed down from Hawaiian royalty and missionaries, the Kings own some of the last priceless virgin parcels of tropical beach in the islands. George Clooney's Matt King joins the characters of Alexander Payne's previous films as a flawed individual finding his way through a world of lunacy, bittersweet emotion and surprises; he is neither a hero nor anti-hero. Like Matthew Broderick's envious teacher in ELECTION, Jack Nicholson's glass-half-empty retiree in ABOUT SCHMIDT,and Paul Giamatti's muddling, middle-aged wine country tourist in SIDEWAYS, King is not the man he would like to be. His mischievous daughters don't trust him, his imperiled wife has been cheating on him and his broke cousins see him and the land trust he controls as a piggy bank. To add insult to injury, he's surrounded by a lush, fertile, awe-inspiring landscape that defies his inner turmoil. Yet all of this leads Matt to a tumultuous awakening that might be awkward, comical and sometimes absurd, but nevertheless changes his concept of love, fatherhood and what it truly takes to be a man. Clooney's achievements as a performer and a filmmaker have earned him an Academy Award, two Golden Globes and an Emmy®, as well as four other Oscar nominations, six additional Golden Globe nominations, and numerous SAG, BAFTA, Emmy and Critics' Choice Awards. In 2006 he received the American Cinematheque Award and the Modern Master Award from the Santa Barbara Film Festival. Clooney's upcoming film projects include the political thriller THE IDES OF MARCH, Smokehouse's (the company Clooney started with Grant Heslov) first production under their deal with Sony Pictures. Clooney, who co-wrote and directed the film, stars with Ryan Gosling, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Paul Giamatti, Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood. Originally from Omaha, Nebraska, Alexander PAYNE (Directed by, Screenplay by, and Produced by) earned his MFA in Film at UCLA and now makes comedies. He debuted with CITIZEN RUTH (1996) and followed up with ELECTION(1999), which won Best Screenplay awards from the Writers' Guild of America and the New York Film Critics Circle, as well as an Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay. ABOUT SCHMIDT (2002), premiered in competition at the Cannes Film Festival and opened the New York Film Festival.

It provides a solemn example of how every single piece of a family can be fragmented yet recreated through communal obstacles.Directed by Alexander Payne (Sideways), the film has been nominated for five Oscars, including ""Best Motion Picture of the Year"" and ""Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role"" going to George Clooney.While delightful slivers of dry humor pop up now and again, the film is surprisingly dreary for having gorgeous Hawaii as a backdrop. When Matt King's (Clooney) wife suffers a tragic boating accident, he rallies his two wayward daughters together to cope with their bed- ridden mother. Tragedies with relatives and friends are always around the corner for the King family. It is difficult to not feel for Matt with the relentless beatings he takes as he keeps a dissonant family together.Spectacular performances by George Clooney and Shailene Woodly (Secret Life of the American Teenager) as Matt King's oldest rebel daughter hold the well-paced narrative together. The two make a great pair and bring their characters to life. The Descendants has an array of lovable supporting characters from a 'head-bopping' grandfather; to an early-developed middle-school girl; to a shaggy-haired tag-along teen struggling with his own family losses. These characters are quirky and play mostly comical roles in the film, but are nevertheless excellent and well-done additions. Hawaii is the perfect choice of location for a project like The Decendants. It offers lush jungles, pristine beaches, modern American cities and laid back residents; plus it allows Clooney to sport the typical Hawaiian floral-print shirt. There is something so fundamentally opposite about placing a broken, distrustful and crude family in such an unspoiled environment that it feels right and disturbingly raw. It seems as though more and more families around the world are being torn apart for a billion different reasons, leaving its members feeling abandoned or helpless. This film strikes at the heart of this problem, forcing the audience to grit their teeth through it all: the vulgarity spewing out of a 12 year old's mouth and the binge drinking habits of an unappreciated high school daughter. Thankfully, the film allows its viewers to leave the theater with a handful of hope for today's families instead of a downhearted silence. This film comes surprisingly close to one of those offbeat independent movies where the importance of a good story clearly ranks higher than profit-making strategies for the filmmakers. It is a breath of fresh Hawaiian air from much of the other junk being shown on the silver screens and truly worth an intentional watch if the threat of tears does not bother you.",The Descendants
431,levinga,Don't waste your time,1,3 December 2011,"Don't recall seeing a movie as bad as this one. Plot does not go anywhere and acting is pathetic. We kept checking the time to see how long is left of this nightmare. I really really don't understand what people saw in this. Some things I didn't like: shallow conversations, predictable plot, the whole story could have been told in 30 minutes instead of 2 hours, unending fill-ins with Hawaiian music and scenery. Also disappointed with George Clooney - he has not helped his career or legacy by playing in this disaster. If you want to see ""Descendants"" because it's by the director of ""Sideways"", this movie is in a different league, and not in a good way. Conclusion: don't waste your time and money.",The Descendants

Don't get me wrong, there is definitely an audience who would appreciate this film. In my opinion, however, it definitely lacks any kind of spark that would lead my to recommend it to anyone.Even with Handsome George and Elegant Shailene, there is not enough of a plot or surprise or action to keep one satisfied. I considered leaving after an hour in and regret not doing so.I can't even recommend this movie to someone who enjoys a feel-good, old-fashioned and polite kind of film because some of the language used by the cast is quite brash and offensive.Save your money, and your time unless you're having trouble sleeping.T",The Descendants
433,rbbloom,Rich bums in lovely Hawaii,3,4 February 2012,"The New York Times has been running banner ads for this film for many months, so I went tonight with some degree of anticipation and was profoundly disappointed.Matt King and his wealthy family, part Anglo and part Hawaiian, own thousands of acres of land fronting the Pacific Coast on Oahu, deeded them by their ancestors and held in trust by them for the island. Matt's wife Elizabeth has been injured in a boating accident and lies comatose and dying in a local hospital. Alexandra, 17, and Scottie, 10, are Matt and Elizabeth's daughters; Alexandra stays at a private boarding school and Scottie lives with her father.Whether this setting provides sufficient material for a plot depends upon your taste for morbid and (on the other hand) jealous emotions without antecedent character development; filthy language spit gratuitously at the camera, primarily by children; long, prurient shots of a 17-year-old girl's thighs and bottom without accompanying tenderness; and a subplot about the affair Elizabeth was having with a local real estate man when the boating accident occurred that we are asked to care about--and that we see the main character, King, care about--even though half of the couple is effectively already dead, and we hadn't been privy to scenes of that relationship, either.In a nutshell: since we never see Matt and Elizabeth while Elizabeth is alive, we can't invest our emotions in Matt, either when he mourns Elizabeth's receding memory or when he feels jealousy upon learning (from his daughter, who is supposedly in school all day) about the affair that took place between his wife and Realtor Brian Speer. Matt's extended search for Speer in order to supposedly settle the score with him, including several chase scenes on foot, are utterly laughable. Indeed, Matt calls himself ""an idiot"", and we are inclined to agree wholeheartedly with him (along with the screenplay writer, who shares the blame), since anyone with any intelligence would write the affair off, and the bad feelings that arise from it, as his dead wife's final fling at life and then turn to the immediate task of emotionally and logistically preparing for her death. But since at least half the movie revolves upon Matt's pursuit of Speer for revenge or what has become morbid information, this while Matt is waiting for his wife to succumb, the temptation to simply walk out of the movie often proves stronger than one's enjoyment of the film's tropical vistas, it's annoying Hawaiian music (annoying because ironic, misplaced, and omnipresent), and older daughter Kayleen Woodley's legs.Clooney's expression runs the gamut from chagrined to chagrined--not that he's given much material to work with--and Woodley's performance, while nuanced by teenager standards, is marred by her character's gratuitously filthy and suggestive language throughout much of the film, which thoroughly removes any sympathy we might have for her from the her first appearance onwards. Some of the best moments, albeit brief, are spent with Realtor Speer and his ingratiating wife Julie, whose emotions seem more authentic, perhaps because more sparely shown.Unless you wish to spend eleven dollars to see stunningly beautiful tropical Hawaii on film here, there is no reason whatsoever to see ""The Descendants"". It is one of the most ill-conceived, purposeless movies ever promoted in the pages of the New York Times.",The Descendants
434,tracyoshea2,extremely boring,1,21 December 2011,"This is by far the worst Clooney movie I've seen yet!,and there has been many!!! It was so boring within the first 45 minutes I kept falling asleep. Ralph and I walked out...the manager gave us back our money. Clooney had no emotions, no expressions, no nothing. All he did was just read the script....he acted like he did not even want to be in this movie. The agony of trying to keep awake in this movie was just too hard for us to take. The manager of the movie theater said that this is the general response he is getting from others....he does not want to see this movie either. I cannot believe Clooney is up for an award, except for worst actor and worst picture! George looks very tired in this picture....I do believe he found it hard to keep awake also, his age is beginning to show. The Ides of March...thank goodness Ryan Gosling took the lead in this picture. Also, the writers for this movie.....I don't know what they were thinking....very poor writing.",The Descendants
435,patriciaanngordon,The softer side of George Clooney....Outstanding,8,22 December 2011,"I'm a big George Clooney fan...I probably fell in love when he was in OR scrubs as Dr. Ross on ER. His film career has spanned the adventuresome 'pretty boy'in the Ocean's series; some out of the ordinary 'comedies'(Burn after reading, O Brother where art thou and Men Who Stare at Goats) and some more serious movies like Michael Clayton and Up in the Air. But none prepared me for seeing my George in such a vulnerable role. Oh sure, he had the money and good lucks we've come to expect but in The Descendants he was blindsided and watched his life spiral away from him at break neck speed. Shailene Woodley as his oldest, somewhat out of control, daughter plays him like a harp...angry, eye rolling, shoulder shrugging teen one moment then warm, compassionate and supportive to her dad Matt King a few scenes later. George is coming of age...he is 50 yrs old, with more gray hair and he's not afraid to age with dignity. Matt King doesn't have all the answers...in fact, he doesn't know the questions. My favourite line (spoiler alert) was when he confronted his wife's lover and, always the gentleman, said 'Elizabeth is dying....no wait. F**K YOU!...oh, and Elizabeth's dying'. I went Hurrah! He's got a spine after all as we had watched Matt stalk Brian Speers but not confront him. As painful as it was to watch Matt get angry then watch him methodically confront the 'other man', the life lesson here is 'yes Virginia...it is hard to confront our demons but healing can't begin until you stare your enemy in the face'. George not only met his demons, he did with force, strength but always with a good dose of class. He even produced a tear on cue. This is an Academy award winner for sure.",The Descendants
436,tes0605,"Good movie, Some of the plot a little dull",8,17 January 2012,"The actors performed exactly as they should and the character Sid or whatever his name was, was interesting. Throughout the movie Clooney talks about a trust of land his family is going to sell and he is the trusty and it is his decision on whether to sell or not. Its to obvious of a plot line that in the end he is not going to sell. Also when the family is sitting around in the room with their dying mother it gets a bit boring. Otherwise, I thought the affair and how Clooney handles it is hilarious. The daughters are a bit predictable throughout the movie also. They start evil hating their father and all of that stuff. Then they slowly get closer and closer. The misery in paradise theme of the movie was genius. I mean it is difficult to show someone so upset and distraught when they live in such a place with such a large amount of money and you can actually feel this throughout the movie. Getting back to Sid, he comes into the movie a little strong with complete disregard for anyones feelings but Alexandras and seems a little dumb... but without that character i would have given this movie a 6 or a 5 and a half if i could.",The Descendants

438,richard-265-322482,"Sentimental, slow; nice Clooney performance",6,23 April 2012,"Mild, general spoilers follow, but nothing you wouldn't find out within the first fifteen minutes of the film. The value of this review is purely that it's written from the standpoint of someone who rarely watches anything but action/adventure films. I did like this piece, although it was marred (specifically the DVD I rented from RedBox) by a long string of unskippable trailers.Descendants is a dual-themed film that's, on the one hand, about a large extended family that has held sizable chunks of Hawaiian land for a number of generations, and which is collectively contemplating the sale of the last big chunk of that land. The sole trustee/executor of the estate, played by George Clooney, a lawyer, is putting the family through the paces of figuring out what to do, initially without a lot of concern about the outcome (which comes to a vote at the end of the film).Interwoven with this first theme is another theme - really the primary focus of the film - namely the grief of Clooney's character and his two daughters over the loss of their mother and his discovery that she had had an affair.Clooney is terrific as a well-meaning but disengaged father and husband who struggles with the dysfunction of the people around him - and who recognizes the hand he's played in it. Basically we get to watch him, as the film plays out, work out a kind of truce with his kids and make peace with himself and his wife.I would never have watched this movie if I'd seen a review like this, so let me just add that it's a decent enough film to have engaged me, mostly, despite the fact that it's thickly sentimental at times, slow, and not my genre.",The Descendants
439,normalearmonth546,Pleasantly Surprised,8,20 January 2012,"I am not your usual chick flick sort of gal so I did have reservations about this film. I love horror, action packed and thrillers what could I like about this? George Clooney's characters wife unfortunately is in a coma and with two girls not used to him being around are forced together with him having to learn how to communicate and show much needed love and understanding as we soon learn not everything in the garden is not rosy.It soon becomes apparent that his wife is not going to wake up and they have to decide to turn off life support.Not wanting to waste this for anybody I will not go into anymore details but the film shows in a modern day way that when the chips are down a parent's love for his children get them through one of the worst experiences of losing a parent.The acting in this film was truthful, heart felt and inspiring, George Clooney plays an everyday man, nothing special and he does it well as I never found myself attracted to him once really he reminded me of a cheesy 80's porn star,Watch this it is worth seeing xxx",The Descendants
440,smartgalash,Feel good and incredibly realistic,9,31 January 2012,"Refreshingly realistic and deftly embellished with amazing camera work, The Descendants is a film which would definitely give the moviegoer his money's worth without any scope for complaining. The plot revolves around Matt King(George Clooney), the sole trustee of a huge piece of exquisite Hawaiian property, caught in a cobweb of emotional convolutions after his wife slips into coma mode. Having remained aloof from familial bonds for a long time, Matt has to now refresh his relationship with his two daughters Scotty (Amara Miller)and Alex (Shailene Woodley). Every actor sinks their teeth into their roles and churns out highly commendable performances. Depicting a wide range of emotions with an amazing austerity and aplomb, George Clooney sucks you into Matt King's world almost effortlessly. Shailene Woodley, as the rebellious 17 year old, gives a riveting performance which hints at a very promising future for the young star. Amara Miller, as the younger of the two girls, adds a quaint innocence to the film. Nick Krause, as Alex's friend, tickles your ribs adding the required dose of subtle humor. Director Alexander Paynne does a great job, holding your attention during the entire running time of the film and deserves kudos for rendering to the audience a near perfect visual and emotional experience.The film can bring a smile on to your face during several moments and in the same breath make you feel the pain of the characters in a non melodramatic way. Strongly recommended.",The Descendants
441,dougfresh1971,Clooney does it again,10,26 February 2012,"I can safely say that George Clooney is quickly becoming, in terms of acting, this generations Cary Grant. He delivers a brilliant performance in the Descendants as a distracted and distant father and husband forced to deal with a family crisis. The movie itself does an amazing job of mixing the events of a family in an emotional crisis with lighthearted touches. You will laugh and cry. The wonder of this movie is that it does not try hard to accomplish any of this. It feels genuine through out. Keep a close eye on George's facial expressions as he struggles to deal with his families situation - they are worth the price of admission alone.",The Descendants

While leaving the viewer feeling sad and dirty. One of the worst movies I've seen in a while.I think the aim was to create an emotional movie, but it falls short.

If this film gets an Oscar I'll understand the world no longer! Bad story...annoying music, generally weak characters. This film can not be taken seriously. My girlfriend and other guests joining the movie have felt the same. The greater the disappointment, because a lot of reviews were very good!! Completely incomprehensible! I hope the Oscars do not award this film. It has plenty of others who would deserve this. The artist for example. that's interesting and exciting cinema!",The Descendants
444,originalannmar-284-138611,A worthwhile film that deals with a very difficult life event with no easy answers on tap.,8,5 February 2012,"I didn't have high expectations of this film despite having read really good reviews. The trailer didn't seem all that interesting and I think that's because it's impossible to adequately convey the slow unfolding of such a story within a film short. One of the things I really liked about this film was the slow, real time story telling. There are quite a lot of scenes of the father just walking around streets and beaches with his daughters. I've seen it criticized for being 'ordinary' but that's what I loved - the ordinariness of the characters, the lush scenery and slow, slow, laid back Polynesian way of life.My main criticism is that it's so hard to forget who George Clooney is but think he did an admirable job in this role of displaying a range of emotions; particularly his struggles with his daughters as the 'supporting actor' parent suddenly thrust into the driver's seat and having to forge his way ahead with them.The other themes of family connections, ancestral roots and guardianship of pristine land resonate throughout the movie. Time meanders along and is spent looking at old family portraits, meeting family in cafés, viewing the gorgeous land to be sold, and listening Polynesian music as well as trying to cope with an ever worsening situation regarding Elisabeth – the girls' mother. Dealing with an inevitable death (established early in the film) and individual ways of saying goodbye to someone are handled sensitively. The actors playing the daughters do a terrific job as young people trying to cope with a very difficult event in their lives. It's funny, non-sentimental, sad and thought provoking story that has many layers.",The Descendants
445,richardhhdavies,Heartwarmingly entertaining,6,7 February 2012,"The contrast between the beauty of the Hawaiian landscape with the traumatic events unfolding in the plot allow for a beautiful harmony between emotional depth and aesthetic appeal. It is refreshing to see Clooney play a man pushed outside his comfort zone, as opposed to the suave, confident character he so often pulls off in his earlier films such as Ocean's Eleven.However, whilst the relationships between characters introduced early in the film are uneasy at best, the reconciliation between Clooney's character Matt King and his daughter comes all too suddenly without full explanation, rendering it rather unconvincing. Shailene Woodley has to be commended on her performance, portraying, in my opinion the best character in the film, whom the audience immediately warms to, with the most compelling scene featuring her alone as she cries underwater.Amongst all the drama and emotional strain unfolding, Sid is always there to provide a little comic relief, the most memorable of which where he manages to gain some laughs from an Alzheimer patient. It would have been an all too depressing film in his absence. All in all, the film can reach out to a wide audience, and came as enjoyable viewing on a Sunday evening. I could not help feeling, however, like the family at the end of the film, slumped down expressionless on the sofa, as the film never reaches any emotional extremes. A heartwarmingly entertaining film; one to be recommended, not one for the records.",The Descendants
446,adam-brenner-287-331043,You'll only like it because you're excited to see it due to the hype others (in your same situation) have made,2,8 February 2012,"I would rate this with a mere 1 star, but I thought the boyfriend played an excellent integral part (integral only because without him I wouldn't have laughed once).I'll come back to this, but for now, since I'm at work, all I've got to say is that there is NO glimpse of any sort of climax, not even a build up of any sort. The conflicts that arise seem to simply resolve themselves in a matter of seconds with no consequences for any party involved.If anyone remembers the horror that was Burn After Reading, (I wouldn't be surprised if no one remembers it) you'll agree it is just as pointless of a film. One other reviewer said ""good not great"" and I can agree. The acting was fine, but how well can someone act out a meaningless role? The answer is: as well as someone can add 2+2 and get 4. I'm sure there are ways to mess that up, but in the end you don't get anything stunning, you just get what you expect.The fact that this film has so much hype (and will probably be close, if not win, the Oscar) is a testament to the massive amount of ""followers"" we have in our society. The inability to distinguish our own feelings from the feelings of those around us while we watch a film (or do anything, for that matter) ~cough~ Twilight ~cough~ makes this film a masterpiece... sadly, nothing about the film does.",The Descendants

It's a gently paced film but says a lot as it goes. Clooney's heart is in the right place and he's picked the right sort of vehicle for beliefs (I assume so anyway). It's not a comedy but has some very funny moments. The music isn't the usual heart-tugging stuff, it's just lovely Hawaiian folk singing. It would also have been helped by not having someone in the row behind me conducting a running commentary for morons but that's another story. Why is that some people can't go to the pictures without talking to each other about it all the way through? Don't dismiss The Descendants as a sentimental 'chick flick' - it isn't.",The Descendants

Location baths what are some dark and difficult themes in sunsets and soft music, and allows us to view them in more mature light. George Connelly is fine actor, he's brilliant in this and carries every scene with some intensity and honestly. The star of the show is Shailene Woodley. Simply fantastic. I didn't realize this was the same director as sideways but it's has that same feel and the same level of quality. It deals with real life, the life that we all deal with and it does in an honest way, something dignified in the matter in which the film was made.

Remake the same film in a city and it is nothing you would ever consider seeing. No dynamic plot and Clooney could not reflect the deepest emotions a man in his position would feel. After a point where the biggest clue in the story is given to us everything new stops and we follow a very predicted film. On the other hand young actors have some very promising performances that are finally lost due to the dominant scenery. I would prefer a depth in all the characters rather than an easy way to make a mediocre film impressing by putting it in Hawai. Don't see it , does not worth your money and time.

The story is superb, by that I mean that it's so realistic that you think the film could be and probably is based on a true story. But, the story is a sad one in that Matt (George Clooney) is put in such a rare and horrible situation that you think no one should ever have to go through the same thing. It really made me wonder what I would do if I was in his shoes (I probably wouldn't have handled it so coolly). He's got hard-headed daughters and a tag along, moron teenager who is actually pretty lovable in the end.The acting from George Clooney and the rest of the cast was phenomenal. I must admit, I'm not a big Clooney fan but in this film, I forgot all about his 100 Sexiest Men award thing...whatever. He really pulled off a single father who tries to make it very, very well and it was really believable. I thought Shailene Woodley and Judy Greer were also great as King's stubborn daughters and were very convincing in their respectable roles. I must admit, I was surprised to see Matthew Lillard in this film but he was just as great, even though he only had one major scene. I wish there would have been more time with him on screen. I must also mention Beau Bridges role in the film wasn't so big but he was also unforgettable. (Beau is Jeff Bridges brother..I knew he looked familiar.) All in all, I think this film is one of the I've ever seen. I'll honestly say, I cried towards the end, which I've never done on any film in my entire life. I'm talking real drips.

452,lymphaticmassage,George Clooney Does it Again!,3,24 April 2012,"George Clooney is the leading man, this time playing Hawaiian attorney Matt King in Alexander Payne's The Descendants. Matt is financially successful. He's an heir to many acres of pristine undeveloped beach land. He can jet across Hawaii at a moments' notice. But he's also in a troubled marriage, out of touch with his two daughters. He's the self proclaimed ""back-up"" parent. He broods. He becomes passionate when he finds out about his wife's infidelity. Sadly, he is not so passionate about the lives of his daughters, or for his wife who has fallen into a coma, heading towards certain death. Instead of dealing with his wife's tragedy or daughter's needs, he drags the girls across Hawaii so he can play the game of Strong Manly Man confronts Wife's Evil Adulterer Lover.In more capable hands, this set up could be extremely comic, tragic and moving on many levels (Love Liza is a great example of a successful comic family tragedy). However, this script and Payne's work fall flat, introducing a weak cliché subplot while missing other boats of possibilities for comedy and dramatized family relations. Payne is a worthy director, but this was a bad day at the office.King's oldest daughter Alex, 17, played by Shailene Woodley, appears as the troublemaker in her first scene. Alex is a typical confrontational teenager, and Woodley's acting is a shining light in this film, showing refreshing charismatic skill that is beautiful and energetic. She's strong opposition to King's pathetic weakness. Problem #1 is the male emasculation theme, which was funny for awhile in the late 90's but that field's been harvested down to dead sticks. The Descendants hacks away at it here, which in 2012 is annoying and eye roll inducing.The film does not adequately explain the daughters' quick turnaround from being neglected and estranged from their father to happily bonding over ice cream and television. Matt and Alex are angry because of the infidelity, but the script oddly avoids any introspection into the status of the King's marriage, why cheating occurred, or why Matt does not have a close relationship with his daughters. Matt appears not to know much about them, and shows little interest in their own lives and passions - to film's end.The Hawaiian backdrop to The descendants is beautiful, as is the musical score of wonderful ukulele Hawaiian music. These are welcome sidetracks for the eyes and ears, where other beauty is lacking.I root for George Clooney. I want him to surprise me, to be a good actor. But his face is blank. Anger is expressed as two dimensional confident aggression. His sadness is not convincing. He seems disconnected from his body, and does not use it to enhance his performances. There's little warmth or human subtlety or artistic energy. Clooney doesn't act, he caters to his public - maintaining big brown puppy dog eye contact, rarely blinking or looking away. He avoids getting lost in roles, letting go, being truly broken or despairing; things that draw compassion and interest from audiences, things that other lead male actors do as a matter of course. Others would have torn this role up with comedic tragedy or emotional drama, using skills Clooney lacks (Mark Ruffalo, Viggo Mortensen, Leonardo DiCaprio, Bill Murray, Johnny Depp, Brad Pitt, James Franco, Hugh Grant - no joke, in a UK version he'd be good, really funny.) I get it. There are millions in the ""he's dreamy"" Church of George Clooney. I am not one. I think he is without charm while also eminently, unattractively confident in himself. He seems physically strong, but is not athletically graceful. He insists with the excessive eye contact as if he were still a handsome, doe-eyed 25 year old, but now he just looks like an old guy staring you down. In The Descendants, Clooney's gait is like an old man with hip problems, and it distracted me into worrying about his health. He's akin to Charlie Sheen, Sean Penn, and movie stars from the 50's whose voices expose their excessive vices.Sadly, the potential for Clooney to bring a well-needed spark of life to The Descendants was as unlikely as becoming so mesmerized by a Clooney performance that you forget you're watching George Clooney.If you're a member of the CGC, ignore this review and grab the popcorn.

An (un)American classic",9,20 June 2012,"It doesn't surprise me that there are so many bad reviews for this film, because it must be totally alien for American viewers to see a film that doesn't have gun splatters, vampires, softcore porn or fart jokes. This is subtle, real and human, even for an Alexander Payne film. Far more European than American, yet utterly American. It's even difficult to pin down the genre. It's got the structure of a classic comedy, it certainly has humorous moments; yet it never plays it more than real. Without going too much into the story—because to do so would give too much away—every scene from the beginning is unexpected, every character takes unexpected turns and every actor is believable as the character they play. So many Hollywood films are merely an escape from life, so it's refreshing to see a film that allows you to explore your own life. I do believe every Alexander Payne film has been better than the last, and hope there are many more to come.",The Descendants
455,subzero-wolfman,For Whom the Archipelago Tolls,9,28 May 2012,"Despite the not-so-endearing reviews on this page, I went to see this movie, and I was quite amazed. (Let me add that I watched it in German, but as far as I can tell, the synch was as good as they come.)This movie sets the tone for what it is about in its very opening line, and in my opinion, holds true to that throughout. It is definitely unique in its impressionistic approach, and that is what some might consider ""boring"" or ""overdone"". To me, it is staying true to the overall idea of a man awakening to his surroundings just when they seem to be talking to him the least.It has been said here that the editing were ""poor"". I do think that the editing is, indeed, a bit over-accentuated, but that goes well with the overall impressionist idea. The same holds true for lighting and music, which are a bit ""do-you-get-my-drift""-ish, but that's okay, because, yes, I DO. There is a certain idea to be conveyed, and I don't mind having it hammered home to me in this particular case, because it is done respectfully and without any moralistic conclusiveness.Everything in this movie breathes the ambiguity of the protagonist's situation, and in doing that, speaks loudly to me, personally. Whatever you might think of this flick, you got to admit that it does its best to be a work of art as well as artisanry, and that's more than enough of a recommendation as far as I'm concerned.And finally, we can now riposte when some clever-dick tells us that ""No Man is an Island"" ... that, ""Yes, but behold: Every Family is an Archipelago.""",The Descendants
456,appoloniak,"No substance, only filling",1,3 July 2012,"This had some positive reviews, but that must be (a) the reviewers saw the name Alexander Payne, and didn't bother to watch it or (b) they were severely intoxicated when watching (perhaps on booze supplied by the studio). There is maybe a decent 15-minute short film in this, but it is mostly bulk filling: pretty pictures from Hawaii with an annoying musical score behind it. For each micro-moment of actual action propelling the story forward were about ten minutes of picturesque Hawaiian landscapes or establishing shots of Clooney walking forlornly on beaches. How this film managed to get a screen-writing Oscar is beyond my comprehension. If you are not into Hawaiian style music, the score may also make you want to hurt yourself with whatever implement you find handy. Sadly, the sofa is not good for this. I just wanted to abandon it, but my boyfriend kept watching, as he said ""waiting for the comedy to start"". Well, it never did.",The Descendants

Here is mine: Having gone through the loss of a spouse via hospital tubes, medication and end of life decision making, I was very impressed with Clooney's delivery of the complicated emotions undeniably attached. It's hard to describe how each twitch of his eyes,or rise of his chest with a breath,communicates just how the brain/thoughts process these heavy, heavy circumstances. I was thankful for the respect the director gave this unpopular subject, and it restores my faith that REAL life subjects can be explored and opened up for people to grow. KUDOS.",The Descendants

459,MammyMa,Hollow performances in an average movie,6,21 January 2013,"Here you have a man who is emotionally detached from virtually everyone around him. He shoulders great responsibility passed down to him over generations. He has attached himself to his late father's maxim that you should live within your means and leave just enough to enable your children to make their own way in life. What happens when this man gradually discovers that his unquestioned trust in those closest to him is misplaced, his little family is falling apart, his nasty bullish father-in-law is preserving an illusion, his larger family are mostly spendthrift self-seeking opportunists and he has to do something about it? George Clooney does a reasonably good job of portraying the narrator although he doesn't possess the acting range to do the part justice – he looks a bit vacant most of the time. He is ably supported by the two girls but the boyfriend was out of place. The ending of this morality tale was predictable and satisfying although the sacrifices made were relatively minimal - nothing in this movie was life threatening, it was all about trust, loyalty and finding contentment in what you have. As a global citizen I fear for what we're doing to the environment. I assume that the cinematography was not intended to be stunning. I know plenty of places in the British Isles that bear comparison to the scenery in the Hawaiian Islands. If we had the same weather, we might have more high risers – maybe it's a blessing in disguise.",The Descendants

He did an excellent job of taking a book and making it into a great movie. The heart of the story is constantly beating with the images, the score, the shots and the acting. George had his hand on the pulse of his character. It felt like a documentary as we shared in his journey in these difficult times that allowed us to peak into his life.

Throughout, he became the only character I genuinely cared for. The rest of the cast all gave fairly brain dead performances, if you can excuse the somewhat black double meaning. Apart from Clooney, the only other interesting character development comes from that of the eldest daughters boyfriend. Clooney originally takes him to be a dense and ignorant teenager. However, upon finding out that his dad died two months prior to Clooney's wife's accident, it reveals a side that makes the audience, and indeed Clooney's character, overall more understanding and sympathetic whilst also creating a sense of guilt from a false premature judgement. With a below par plot line and many things left unresolved this film deserves no more than a 5 out of 10.",The Descendants
463,planet_treasures,The story didn't follow the title of the movie,3,27 November 2011,"Maybe I am missing something but I didn't get it with this movie. The title of the movie doesn't coincide with the story. The story to me is about a man (Clooney) who struggles with his emotions when he finds out his wife cheated on him. Throughout the movie he has this relentless search to find the paramour, this man who apparently had an affair with his estranged wife.In the meantime there is a group of 'descendants' who we know very little about except they are a group of fortunate souls who shall inherit millions of dollars upon the sale of prime real estate. Mr. King (Clooney) as the trustee of the real estate has the unenviable task of making or breaking the sale. The question becomes 'what does any of this have to do with the theme of the story which seems more to do with his failed marriage?' We know very little about Mr. King or his children (two daughters, one seven years of age and the older sister aged 17). Though they are in at least half the scenes all we learn about them is they are rebellious kids, the elder of the two who explicitly vents her anger against her mother. But why? At the beginning of the movie Mr. King discusses with the audience his apparent lack of communication with his wife and at first it seems the movie will take us down the path of his life and failed marriage. But that does not happen.All we know is that Mrs. King is lying in a hospital bed apparently already dead if not for the breathing apparatus that keeps her alive. But we learn nothing of the troubled marriage or of the estranged wife who is dying before our eyes. Yet, the descendants keep popping up in the movie like a sideshow. I mean, so what? The heirs shall soon become millionaires, yet Mrs. King is about to lose everything including her life. So who is this dying woman and what is her life about? We are not even shown a flashback of this person or even know what she looks like prior to the accident. There is a scene where a photo of an attractive blonde is offered but no dialogue explains who is in the picture.As the movie went along I wanted to learn more about the dying woman. After all, is that not the tragedy of the movie? The poor girl is losing her life yet the director would have us believe the Clooney is the victim here. Poor Mr. King is left behind with his bratty kids and millions of dollars. I doubt the good-looking, wealthy Mr. King will have any problem with his love life, nor in the financial arena.This movie would have worked if it spent more time on the life and family of the dying Mrs. King. The descendants had absolutely nothing to do with anything. Clooney acted a decent role but it was far short of phenomenal and Oscar quality.",The Descendants
464,neillwendyl,Conservation Theme,7,15 October 2013,"While many documentaries have an overt message, this film was subtle yet effective in getting the conservation point across. It shows a very human side to the choices that are made daily to preserve and protect natural resources and our complicated cultural heritage. Ordinary, unlikely people (real-estate lawyer) can be stewards of the environment whether they are forced into that role (as in this film,) or if they choose to oppose developing every piece of land and advocate for saving some of it.The main character, played by Clooney, seems almost heroic in the way he deals with the difficult situation of his wife's accident, his neighbors opposition to the land deal, and facing his family (and his wife's family). We are not really sure what caused this abrupt transformation, but his growing relationship with his daughters seems to contribute to it.As far as happy endings go-it was portrayed in a human way, not the fairy-tale one I would have written (A camping trip on the preserved land with his daughters).I am curious to read the book, and know more about the author (Kaui Hart Hemmings)-is he/ she Hawaiian? It also shows the reality of today's Hawaii-so I get the idea that the author is familiar with it.",The Descendants

To say that I began this movie feeling discouraged is an understatement. However, that was disproved within the first ten minutes. The Descendants will make you laugh, cry, be angry, be surprised, etc. George Clooney and Shailene Woodley's acting jobs are exceptionally phenomenal considering the roles they play. They really made you value the family morals and George Clooney's character, Matt King's, decisions. This movie will cause you to have rapid changes of emotion. You'll feel hate but be pitiful, you'll feel annoyance yet understanding, frustration yet happiness, and the list goes on.

Thought the acting was fine enough but the storyline was just not very interesting. I like Clooney and think a lot of what he's done recently is good but the reaction to this movie makes me wonder if people just automatically love everything the guy touches. I kept thinking the whole movie that the people behind it seemed to think how profound it all was while to me it was really just one cliché after another. The girls playing the daughters did a good job though, and the wife's parents (the dad at the hospital was the one time I found it somewhat touching; he may have been pretty mean previously but there you could see that he was really just in such grief and you could sympathize).But yeah, overall, a disappointing shrug of the shoulders kinda movie, luckily I just watched on a plane and it did its job to pass the time, but not much more.",The Descendants

Subtle at times, a lot of unspoken, body language. Watch the expressions, the gestures, the nods, the change in tones. The confrontations and explosive moments made perfect sense to me. Yes. I think I would have said that. It seems to me that if you have experienced end-of-life matters with a close family member, and saw this experience expose flaws in your personality and relationships, then this movie might make a lot more sense and hit you pretty hard. I guess the only weakness I will mention is the music was a little obtrusive at times.

471,kitfitzgerald,The Descendants: Exploring illusion verses reality,9,5 August 2017,"In the film's opening dialogue Matt's off-scene voice over explains that while most observers would think that he is living the charmed life in paradise. But as he states nothing could be further from the truth. In fact it is this dissonance between illusion and reality that is the real thematic pivot for the film. Matt and his wife Elizabeth have been experiencing marital difficulties for some time. Elizabeth has been involved in a speedboat accident which has left her in a vegetative coma. This situation is further compounded by her doctor's admission that they have done all for her and there is no hope for a recovery. Elizabeth's completion of an advanced health directive to be enforced in such a situation forces Matt to address the approaching decision to turn off her life support. As if this wasn't enough, Mark is facing a major decision regarding his other role as the sole trustee for a vast stretch of natural land on Kauai. His enormous number of cousins and relations are hungry for him to sign off on a land sale offer for future development as a mega condominium and they all want their share of the monitory rewards a deal would bring each one of them. Mark's eldest daughter Alexandra has been sent to the big island in the hope of curbing her excessive destructive behaviour. But as we discover, there was a compelling reason for her teenage angst. She tells her father that his wife was carrying on an affair with a local real estate agent Bob Speer. Matt is completely blindsided with this dramatic revelation. Even his close mutual friends seem to have actively supported his wife's extramarital activities. They also inform him that his wife was seriously contemplating divorcing Matt. Again Mark sees the dissonance between his assumptions and the underlying realities of his life and the relationships with family. His grief and rage at the duplicity of his wife, her lover and the mutual friends that openly supported her infidelity is heartfelt and realistically portrayed. He is surely a man caught between several rocks and hard places. This is truly an affirmation that ""Shit Happens!"" There are several themes that are hinted at during Matt's attempt to understand and respond to his wife's betrayal. It is revealed that Elizabeth's lover, Bob Speer would be one of the major beneficiaries if the land sale went ahead, and suggests that there might have been strong motives for the realtor to get inside information on the land deal through his tapping Matt's wife. To Elizabeth's bereft parents, she was their princess who could do no wrong, and that her medical situation was somehow exacerbated by Matt's treatment of her. Interestingly, while armed with clearly supported ammunition of her infidelity, Matt decides not to inform her parents of the truth. Thus out of kindness, Matt allows her parents to cling to their illusions concerning their daughter. The performances of the major players are very strong. As a follower of George Clooney's movie career for some time I was blown away be the sheer spectrum of emotional states he was able to bring to his character Matt. I would even go out on a limb and suggest that this was truly one of his best performances to date. The actresses playing his two daughters were also excellent. Initially expecting his eldest daughter to be a complete out of control brat, we discover that her actions have been motivated by her mother's destructive actions and her need to prevent hurting her father and exploding the family. Scottie, Matt's youngest daughter's gradual acceptance of her mother's encroaching demise through the help of a counsellor was particularly well-handled. Bob Speer was found to be the shallow opportunist one expected him to be, more interested in saving his marriage than owning up to his weaknesses. Matt's money- focused cousin played by Jeff Bridges was a perfect counterweight to Matt's increasing misgivings about signing the deal. I think a neglected player in this drama was the character of Sid, the friend of Matt's eldest daughter. Again this is yet another example of illusion verses reality. We along with Matt are quick to judge a book by its cover – that Sid is a somewhat simple, narly dude with little of any insight or substance. But as the two men interact, we along with Matt discover that our initial prejudices concerning Sid were perhaps ill-founded, and that he is a much more complex personality with his own experiences with the crap that real life throws at people. Yes, the film does explore the theme of family dysfunction as well as re-connection between father and daughters. But for me it is far more complex exploration of deeper underlying themes that plague individuals such as their relationships, the challenges confronting them through discovery of deception and concealment. It is about balancing the ties of family generations with the legacy of the past. It is also a film about experiencing grief in losing people you love and the need to accept letting them go. I openly admit to a pair of damp eyes especially during the poignant hospital scenes. It is a situation that I was faced with several years ago with my own wife. Good films are like any other form of art. Some films predominantly focus on eliciting feelings in the viewer. Other films may attempt to initiate thinking. Yet other films are able to attain the ability to force viewers to feel, think and question ourselves and our own values and moral positions. In a deceptively understated manner with an excellent transposing of Kaui Hart Hemmings' original written novel to the big screen, The Descendants would have to be one movie that has achieved ticking all the crucial boxes for me anyway. As it stands it is what it is; a gem.",The Descendants
