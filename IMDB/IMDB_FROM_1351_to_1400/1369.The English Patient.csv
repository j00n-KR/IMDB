0,MartinHafer,why is this film so popular?,2,2 March 2005,"Years ago, I saw an episode of SEINFELD in which Elaine described this movie as a colossal bore that seemed to go on forever (though less than 3 hours long, it did seem to go on for an eternity). I should have taken her advice and avoided this movie like the plague. The first tip-off that it would be a bore-fest was that it had won so many academy awards. In recent years, several amazingly dull films have been the recipient of arm loads of awards but were box office poison because the public couldn't stand them (another example of this would the the sterile LAST EMPEROR).My wife and I were amazed at how much we disliked the film. The ""love"" affair between the leads was completely unbelievable and stupid. One minute, they hate each other and the next they are copulating like crazed weasels! And, to top this off, these were perhaps the ugliest stars ever seen naked on the screen. I kept wanting to shout ""put it BACK on--PLEASE"". In fact, they were such an unappealing couple that I strongly recommend parents send their teenagers to watch this film. The sight of their naked bodies is perhaps the strongest enticement towards abstinence known to mankind!However, the ugliness of the film doesn't end there. Towards the end, in order to try to save his lover's life, the male lead makes a deal to help the Nazis....yes, Nazis!!! Who cares that they were trying to take over the world and liquidate a few million?! All his character cared about was his sweetie. Oh, and did I mention that along the way they ended up killing her husband? Nothing says romance like this film!!",The English Patient
1,TheLittleSongbird,Intensely moving and beautifully shot,9,12 April 2011,"I personally have never understood the backlash The English Patient gets. I can understand why it might try someone's patience, as the pace is very slow and perhaps purposefully so and the film is very long at over two-and-a-half hours, but I do think it is unfair that there are those who consider one of the worst Best Picture winners(I personally think Crash, Cimarron, Braveheart and The Hurt Locker are worse, I have never understood the hate for Shakespeare in Love either as in my opinion that's better than the movie-Saving Private Ryan- that almost everyone says should have beat it). Fargo is a great film as well, whichever film won made no difference to me, as long as they are great movies which they are.The English Patient may be a slow movie, with all the dates, character relationships and events unfolding at a purposefully leisurely pace, but it is also intensely moving, beautifully shot and compelling. The film looks stunning, the dessert scenes especially are reminiscent of the epic sweeping feel that Lawrence of Arabia had. The cinematography is incredibly beautiful, and the costumes and scenery are wonderfully lavish and evoke the period seamlessly. The English Patient has a truly haunting and heart-wrenching score, particularly in the end credits, complete with some fitting music choices. The film also has a poetic and thought-provoking script, a compelling story that conveys the characters' predicaments wonderfully complete with flashbacks that enhance rather than jar and superb direction by the late and very talented Anthony Minghella.The English Patient has a strong emotional impact as well, the climatic sequence in particular moved me to tears that stayed long after the movie was over. The characters are richer and more complex than one might think, Almasy especially is very haunted and pained, and dealt with in an incredibly subtle way. The acting does perfect justice to these characters, Ralph Fiennes is absolutely brilliant in one of his best and more complex performances(I'd say only Schindler's List is better), and Kristen Scott Thomas shows a great chemistry with him, the scene where she is carried out of the cave by him is one of extreme pathos. Juliette Binoche is equally affecting, and Willem Dafoe and Kevin Whately are as strong as ever.All in all, a moving and beautiful film, cinematically and emotionally. 9/10 Bethany Cox",The English Patient
2,Leofwine_draca,Pressure sores?,4,16 September 2021,"I saw this at the cinema. It seemed to go on and on and I'm sure I got pressure sores as a result. It soured me on Fiennes and Scott Thomas for life, so earnest are they, so unrecognisable to ordinary people. The historical trappings and backdrop is fine but the highbrow nature of the production feels false and artificial to me.",The English Patient
3,SnoopyStyle,grand romantic epic,7,25 October 2014,"A badly disfigured man suffering from amnesia is brought in to the Allies by the Bedouins. Canadian nurse Hana (Juliette Binoche) has lost many friends including her love. It's near the end of WWII. She brings the dying man to an abandoned Italian mansion to take care of by herself. She is joined by Allied soldier Kip Singh (Naveen Andrews) and David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe) who claims to know the man from before. The movie flashes back from time to time. The mysterious man is Hungarian map maker Count Laszlo de Almásy (Ralph Fiennes) on an expedition to chart the Sahara desert for the Royal Geographical Society. He is joined by Geoffrey Clifton (Colin Firth) and his wife Katharine (Kristin Scott Thomas) on the expedition. This is an old fashion grand romantic epic. The story is vast like the desert and winding like all great romances. The acting is brilliant by so many great actors. The desert looks hypnotic. It does lack a drive to push the story along its extended running time. At times, the movie goes too slowly. I wonder if the movie would be better without so much back and forth in time.",The English Patient
4,Hitchcoc,Totally Captivating,10,4 February 2010,"I have had this film on my radar since it won the Oscar lo these many years. It is described as romantic drama and the sound of it turned me off. Now that I've seen it, I know why it was so highly thought of. Those who criticize it seem to have two axes to grind. It's too long and the characters are unlikeable. I never thought for a moment that the film was too long; I didn't even notice the length. As for the characters, they are what they are, incredibly complex. Throw people into the mess of war and they don't behave ""properly."" This is a movie about undying love and the reality of conflict. We continue to fight wars despite the toll they produce. Human beings aren't satisfied with being the chosen species, they have to go about taking that from others. I know this sounds simplistic. Of course, wars need to be fought, but the price is great. Yes the main characters are selfish and passionate and don't look back very well. People to cheat and divorce and act on baser instincts, but the movie lets us know why their motives are. Sometimes I think that people would like a cotton candy presentation of life. Well, that's not art. Art gets at the guts of what we are and presents it to us, even if we don't like it. I thought Fiennes character was at times a total ass. He took and didn't give back. He catalogued his life inside a copy of Herodotus, creating a scrapbook of his existence. There are also our peripheral characters. Kip and Hana who are also victims of war, and the Dafoe character who hasn't lost as much but is marked for life. Everyone grows, even in the faith of death, and the spirit lives on. This is one marvelous film.",The English Patient
5,Horst_In_Translation,Excellent film in terms of drama and romance,8,7 March 2015,"The almost three-hour-long ""The English Patient"" was the big winner at the 1997 Academy Awards scoring wins in no less than nine categories (maybe a bit too much even if I liked the film) despite coming short in Screenplay, Lead Actor and Lead Actress. However, the stunning Juliette Binoche surprisingly defeated Lauren Bacall in the supporting actress category. The film is almost 20 years old now and has aged pretty nicely. It's still a very good movie. Even if it plays during times of war, this is really just the setting. There are no long scenes of significant battles. It is much more about the (love) relationships of the central characters during these difficult times. Admittedly, the impact of war on these is very crucial.In flashbacks we find out about Ralph Fiennes' character's fate while in the now, it is all about Juliette Binoche's character. That is also why her classification as a supporting character is slightly odd in the face of Scott Thomas playing a lead character. The movie has quite a few very dramatic and tense scenes. The highlight is probably the defusing of the big bomb by the Binoche's character's love interest in this movie. Edge-of-seat stuff with the loud noise approaching and I really wondered is he gonna survive it or is a catastrophe about to happen. Watch for yourself. Willem Dafoe was as good as always and he played once again a character where you can never be sure if he is good or bad and of course it is, as always with him, no clean black or white, but something in-between. All about shades. His questioning was also one of the most dramatic scenes of the film and almost physically painful to watch. There is also a parallel between his fate and the fate of Fiennes' character. Both are questioned and suspected of working for enemy forces, but while Dafoe's character fears his own death, Fiennes' character only fears the death of Kristin Scott Thomas' character.This film was a breakthrough for many of the actors involved: Firth (unlikeable for once), Binoche and Fiennes to mention only a few, but also for many of the crew members who won Oscars for their work here. This movie is also quite an achievement in terms of technical aspects. Visually, it is great to watch and the sound work is effective as well. It is really difficult to pick a favorite scene, but as I mentioned some of the dramatically effective scenes already, I also want to name the church scene with Binoche and Naveen Andrews. Very very beautiful and so harmonic. Quite a joy to watch.I highly recommend watching this movie directed and written by Anthony Minghella based on the novel by Michael Ondaatje. It has great emotional impact. Maybe, it is the film that comes closest to a description as a modern ""Lawrence of Arabia"".",The English Patient
6,classicsoncall,"""She died because of me, because I loved her.""",8,27 June 2018,"As is so often the case, I'm very late in getting around to ""The English Patient"", in this case it's been a couple of decades. I recall the fanfare surrounding the movie when it was released, subsequently repeated when it was the winner of nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Told in a series of flashbacks, the story recounts the nature of an affair between Hungarian Count Laszlo de Almasy (Ralph Fiennes) and the married Englishwoman Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas). Their passionate relationship ends in a double tragedy for both principals in a confluence of unrelated events, though it could be maintained just as Almasy stated in my summary line, that he was responsible for her death. One may argue the circumstances of Geoffrey Clinton's (Colin Firth) plane crash, though to my mind his attempt at murder/suicide failed only in the respect that his intended victim was the only one who survived. I can readily understand the conflicted opinions other reviewers bring to the table here. It's a difficult thing to weigh the difference between an unfaithful spouse and an affair that arises out of true love. On that score, I tend to reserve my sympathies on the side of Katharine and Almasy. Yet the story line throws in a complicated betrayal on the part of The Count, who offered his services to the Nazis in order to return to his injured lover in the desert. In that regard, I do not absolve Almasy for the courage of his convictions, even when he rationalizes that ""thousands of people DID die, just different people"". Evoking the grand sweep and epic proportions of ""Lawrence of Arabia"", the film is a haunting tale of love endured under compromising circumstances that ends unsparingly for the characters and viewer alike. The performances of all the principals are noteworthy, with a special nod to Juliette Binoche in her role as Almasy's nurse as his intricate story unfolds. To be fair, the film requires some patience, as it's nearly three hour run time will test the resolve of uncommitted viewers, though many will find their forbearance well rewarded.",The English Patient
7,gavin6942,More Than a Romance,6,19 May 2015,"At the close of WWII, a young nurse tends to a badly-burned plane crash victim (Ralph Fiennes). His past is shown in flashbacks, revealing an involvement in a fateful love affair.This movie tends to get billed as a great romance, and maybe that is fair. But it also happens to be much more, with Willem Dafoe playing a Canadian spy. Wait, what? So this is a spy thriller, too? Well, not exactly. But Dafoe does the part well, coming off as nasty and jealous. Which, really, suits him rather well. (How would Bruce Willis have done in the same role?)Ralph Fiennes looks good in the burn makeup... could it be this is what helped him land the role of Voldemort? I would not be the least bit surprised.",The English Patient
8,lee_eisenberg,this didn't deserve Best Picture,5,24 June 2005,"When ""The English Patient"" was in theaters, one of my mom's friends went to see it and was mildly disturbed by it, since it focuses on a man getting burned. My parents and I finally saw it about a year later. None of us could understand why this movie won nine Oscars. As far as we could tell, it was another case of using some historical event as the context for a love story (around the time when we saw it, ""Titanic"" was in the theaters, so that was eating at us a little). The story has Hana (Juliette Binoche), a French-Canadian nurse, helping surplice crash victim Almasy (Ralph Fiennes) in North Africa during WWII. Also with them is a man named Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe).Granted, ""The English Patient"" wasn't an awful movie. It did look at WWII and how that was affecting various people. But the whole thing seemed a little overblown; the scene that really caught my eye was when Hana took a bath in the fountain. And maybe it was a little bit jarring to see Willem Dafoe in this kind of a movie, since I had just seen him in the god-awful ""Speed 2"". But really, how could this movie take home nine Oscars when ""Shine"" was also nominated?",The English Patient
9,jboothmillard,The English Patient,8,13 July 2005,"After the recent death of Oscar and BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated director Anthony Minghella (The Talented Mr. Ripley, Cold Mountain), it was right that this award winning film should be shown on TV, and I watched. Basically it is is World War II, and Count Laszlo De Almásy (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Ralph Fienes) is found near a plane crash in the Sahara desert with a hideously burnt face, but he has no memory of who he is, where he comes from, or any past. Hana (Oscar and BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated Juliette Binoche) is the nurse helping him, and as more and more of his possessions are shown to him, he begins to remember who he is, and the love he once had. This is when we go into flashbacks to see Laszlo living his life not as an English man, he is minor Hungarian, but anyway, we see his growing love affair with Katharine (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Kristin Scott Thomas), wife of Geoffrey Clifton (Colin Firth). Back in the present, there are some subplot stories, for example, the growing friendship, or more, with Hana and bomb disposal expert Kip (Naveen Andrews), and David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), who knows Laszlo from past experience. Towards the end, Geoffrey discovered the affair, and purposely crashed his plane in the desert, with Katharine in the back, and Laszlo saw this, and takes her to a cave, finding out that she is going to die (broken ribs). He promised to being back help, but the English take him prisoner, so he surrenders to some Germans by giving them some maps, and he gets their plane, and of course, he was too late to save her. In the present day, he dies of natural causes. A very good story, with a lot of thought provoking moments of war, love and survival. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Music for Gabriel Yared, Best Sound and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, it won the BAFTAs for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film, and it was nominated for Best Costume Design, Best Make Up/Hair and Best Production Design, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Original Score and Best Screenplay. Juliette Binoche was number 88, and Ralph Fiennes number 83 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Fiennes was also number 28 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, the film was number 56 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, it was number 60 on The 100 Greatest War Films, it was number 15 on The 50 Greatest British Films. Very good!",The English Patient
10,ccthemovieman-1,"Nice Visuals, But Another Overrated Oscar Winner",5,6 June 2006,"I did give this film several shots. I just couldn't like it, but I really tried. The cinematography I enjoyed with all viewings, especially the scenes in which they flew over beautiful sand dunes. However, midway through the story it bogs down in this adulterous love affair between Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas. It picks ups slightly, but never really recovered. In both viewings, I wound up counting down the time left in the film. It's basically a woman's movie.As a man, I enjoyed watching the beautiful Juliette Binoche, who plays a nurse who takes care of the burned Fiennes, whose scarred body, frankly, is interesting to view. Binoche has an affair with an Indian man and the highlight of that romance is when he hoists her aloft on a harness to see paintings high up on a church wall.Fiennes, Thomas and Willem Dafoe all played unlikeable characters to me and didn't make the film worth giving it a third look. As I said, I tried.....and I was hardly alone. Of about a half-dozen friends I discussed this film with, I don't know one person who liked it. I was actually kinder towards it than most. Once again, we see an example of a modern-day movie that Academy Awards voted ""Picture Of the Year"" and most of the public disliked. The public, as usual, was a better judge.",The English Patient
11,rmax304823,Haunted Pasts.,7,18 February 2013,"Ralph Fiennes is the English patient. It's World War II and he's been burned to one of those scarred, blue-white human simulacra who is slowly dying. His nurse, Juliette Binoche, keeps him pumped up with morphine in a half-ruined abbey.Willem Dafoe is a dope addict who holds Fiennes responsible for his torture by the Germans, particularly by a villainous German officer in a fine performance by Jurgen Prochnow. Prochnow's use of torture offends even his own men, who deferentially bring up the Geneva Conventions, never having had the advice of the White House Office of Legal Counsel. Aside from providing the opportunity for a terrible torture scene, it was never really clear to me what Dafoe's mission in the movie was.Fiennes, immobilized in bed, has carried with him a copy of Herodotus, ""the Father of History"". For Fiennes, history is a nightmare from which he is trying to awake. Between Dafoe's quiet interrogations and the mementos Fiennes carried within the tattered pages of Herodotus, the English patient is haunted by past sins, some worthier than others, and finally, with minimal gestures, persuades Binoche to put him to sleep.That's the fictional present in war-blasted Italy. Meanwhile, Fiennes is narcotized to the extent that his chthonic memories are turned into flashbacks -- of friendships he's betrayed, of his love for the lost Lenore, of his minor indiscretions and major screw ups, and of the futility of every effort he's made, except for a few momentary passions.Fiennes has been through a lot in the years between 1939 and 1945 and you get to see much of it. The Tunisian desert is a magnificent landscape -- not so much flat and shimmering with heat, as in ""Lawrence of Arabia"" but criss-crossed by ridges and pillars of a rich rust. The performances are smooth and convincing. The first time I saw the movie, I almost nodded off a few times. Fiennes' haunted past got to me. My own past has enough ghosts. But, wisely, the script has enough tautly done suspense and action sequences that it keeps even lowbrows like myself awake. One of the scenes, of an old-fashioned biplane plowing into the earth accidentally, comes and goes in a few seconds but is excellently shot. Overall, though, the movie might have profited from more such scenes, since it's still pretty sluggish.",The English Patient
12,Quinoa1984,I'm sorry for this review,7,29 April 2000,"I Know I shoudln't apologize for my review, but this is a strong one and I know a lot of women will be reading this.I didn't like this movie.  It's not that it doesn't have convincing drama or romance, or that is doesn't have a good story, it has that.  I just found it too long.  It was as boring as watching golf onm television.  I wanted to like this film (the Academy did, it gave the film 9 Oscars including best film) but I just found something too artsy about it and it was not good.  I reccomend this to heart sick women and depressed lovers.  OTHERS BEWARE. With Ralph Fiennes, Kristen Scott Thomas, Juliet Binoche and Willem Dafoe. D+",The English Patient
13,dbborroughs,If you can get through the first half then you'll probably love this film,9,28 June 2004,"I first saw this under adverse conditions. I had just broken up with my girlfriend and needed to get away and so I went to see what ever was playing next at the multiplex. The last thing I wanted, a romantic drama, was just the thing I needed.Admittedly the first hour and half to two hours can be slow going as we hear the story of the English Patient in flashback. These are very stuffy British people who show little emotion. And then some where around the two hour mark a declaration of love and the movie explodes with emotion...This is great film making.But its so mannered that its tough to get through.Frankly I like the movie better than the book. The book tells you much up front that the movie keeps, I think wisely in reserve. In most ways the two are equal tellings of the same story, however I would be hard pressed to ever pick up the book again.If you can wait for a pay off and like romantic movies then by all means see this wondrous film. Otherwise stay away.",The English Patient
14,grantss,I'm with Elaine Benes on this one,4,29 January 2017,"Late-WW2, Allied-occupied Italy. A nurse at a field hospital is tending to a badly burned English pilot. He has no identification so is referred to as ""The English Patient"". Slowly she starts to piece together his background, including a passionate yet doomed romance with a married woman.9 Oscar wins, including Best Picture. You have got to be kidding! I really don't know what all the fuss was about, as the movie is pretty dull. Empty, style over substance and pretty much schmaltz for schmaltz sake. One of the worst Best Picture Oscar winners.It wasn't like it was such a bad movie year - you had Fargo, Jerry Maguire, Sling Blade, Trainspotting, The People vs Larry Flynt, all of which are infinitely better than this.",The English Patient
15,Boba_Fett1138,A good old fashioned epic!,8,2 September 2012,"It's perhaps easier to simply make fun of this movie but it's in my opinion ridicules to call this a bad movie as well. Yes, it's all a bit drawn out at times, making this movie feel overlong and overall pointless but it's all actually being very consistent with the style of film-making and the approach they were going for with this movie.Basically this movie is being like an old fashioned epic, with grand looking landscapes and a bigger than life story, or in this case love story, in which everything moves slowly but steadily. As often is the case with this type of movies, it's hard to get into at first, since it doesn't really become apparent, right from the start on already, which direction the story will be heading at. But once things are starting to take form and it becomes more clear what the story is going for, it becomes an engaging movie, as also truly was the case with this movie.I really loved it how things slowly started to take shape within this movie. It also made it more apparent what an actual good and original story this movie has in it. It's not being too complicated either, which makes this movie all the more engaging to watch. No, this really is far from being pretentious genre movie, though it still has some pretentious tendencies in it, especially when it comes down to its acting and characters.Let me just say I wasn't too fond of all the performances in this movie and that goes for Ralph Fiennes' as well. He actually somewhat annoyed me, which is something that Fiennes had never achieved before, at least not with me. I truly think he is one of the best living and still working actors around but in this movie he went for an approach I just didn't liked very well. But really, it might also be very well due to his character and the writing of the movie that I couldn't really appreciate his performance. His character, in my opinion, isn't being likable enough and the love story he gets himself involved in also isn't exactly my idea of a romantic one. Nothing cute about a love story that involves infidelity and it prevented me from rooting for its main characters and for them to end up being together.But OK, I get it. Love just happens sometime, no matter what the place or the circumstances are. And then again, the love story in this movie was never meant to be a happy or careless one, in which everything works out peachy perfect. And that's actually what saved it and made this movie work for me, once I started to realize all of that. It also definitely makes this an original romantic movie, also since the romance itself is often hard to find in the movie. Please don't mistake this movie for a chick-flick, or something like that, since the movie and its story have far more to offer and often goes for a far from typical romantic approach with things.There are also plenty of other things happening in this movie. It doesn't just follow 2 main characters but it has a wide variety of characters in it, each with their own thing going on. It gives the movie plenty of welcome distractions and often helps to give the movie and some of its themes more depth as well. It's also a nice touch that the movie is basically following 2 plot lines, one set in the 'present' and one in the past, all linked together by its main character, played by Ralph Fiennes. This also helps to give the movie some variety and helps to keep the story moving and it's being a good way for the movie to have some mystery and surprises in it as well.Just as good as any other genre movie from the earlier days of the genre, in my opinion!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The English Patient
16,evanston_dad,The BIG Movie of 1996 Seems a Lot Smaller in 2009,7,16 June 2009,"The movie that blew everyone away in 1996, and a rare ""arthouse"" film that managed to cross over into the mainstream.I admit that I was swept up in the ""English Patient"" craze along with everyone else. But I have seen parts of it more recently and have to say that it doesn't hold up well. What seemed passionate and sincere at the time seems overwrought and silly now. The love story between Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas is the stuff of romantic melodrama, pure soap opera, but the historical backdrop of WWII makes it feel more important than it really is. On later viewings, I just wanted to tell these two overly-dramatic lovers to lighten up.The best thing about the film now is the thing that was best about it when it originally appeared, and that's Juliette Binoche, playing a weary and emotionally haunted nurse who gradually learns how to live and love again. Her performance is luminous and lovely, and I would much rather watch a movie just about her.Grade: B",The English Patient
17,anaconda-40658,The Patient is Here.,10,6 January 2016,"The English Patient (1996): Dir: Anthony Minghella / Cast: Ralph Fiennes, Juliette Binoche, Willen Dafoe, Kristen Scott Thomas, Naveen Andrews: Beautiful photography and tremendous production accompany a story of the hardship we often inflict upon ourselves just as the title character is guilty of his own consequential pain. Ralph Fiennes is the English patient and he is heavily sedated in makeup to portray his injury. He was involved in a plane crash and is now under the care of a nurse played by Juliette Binoche. Through flashbacks we witness his affair with Kirsten Scott Thomas and their travels through a windy desert. Spellbinding plot with crucial developments at each flashback, as well as a romance blossoming in the present time. Director Anthony Minghella gradually reveals new information while creating one of his best films. Fiennes is convicting as he reflects on decisions that are answered in tragedy. Binoche is full of life as she connects and finds love in a man leaving Fiennes only to envy. She is romanced by a bomb disposal officer played passionately by Naveen Andrews. Thomas symbolizes the dangers of lust while Willem Dafoe appears as a reflection of torture and pain. This is a great film full of expression and stunning production. Theme regards decision made and the consequences for making the wrong ones. Score: 10 / 10",The English Patient
18,Wuchakk,"Romance, drama and adventure",7,12 March 2014,"Remember the Seinfeld episode wherein Elaine Benes proclaimed how lousy and slow this movie was? (""Why don't you just diiieee!"") Well, that was enough to prevent me from seeing ""The English Patient,"" until recently, that is. I finally decided to kick back and watch the film to see for myself if it was as bad as Elaine said it was (or as good as so many others contended).First of all, the film isn't nearly as long as rumored; it's only two hours and twenty minutes (not including the end credits). Compare that to, say, ""Titanic"" which is almost an hour longer or ""Lawrence of Arabia"" which is an hour and a half longer.Secondly, as long as one is psychologically prepared to see a drama/adventure flick and not an action film, the story sustains interest quite well. Some sequences are slow, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Needless to say, if you're a big fan of ""Armageddon"" -- essentially a two and a half hour trailer with its never-ending quick (and irritating) edits -- you will not like this flick.One might criticize the ignoble and unfaithful character of the lead players. While this is understandable, I don't feel the movie justifies or glorifies their actions -- it's simply a story about REAL people with REAL flaws who make REAL mistakes (just like you and me) and must suffer the consequences. And suffer they do. Besides, there are some highly likable and noble characters in the cast, like Kip and Hana.In light of the criticism of how long and boring this flick is, I was delighted to discover quite a few scenes filled with suspense, action and high-adventure. For example, the plane crash scene (the second one), the desert storm sequence, the bomb-about-to-explode episode and the fight-to-the-death in the train scene, just to name a few.As many reviewers note, the desert cinematography is marvelous; in fact, the movie is worth seeing for this alone.BOTTOM LINE: ""The English Patient"" has elements of ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" ""The Bridges of Madison County"" and ""A Passage to India;"" if you're a fan of the style, pace and realism of these movies then ""The English Patient"" is for you.GRADE: B+",The English Patient
19,zetes,Underrated,10,21 March 2000,"This movie has suffered from an undeserved Oscar backlash. It is truly a powerful film experience. The writing, direction, and acting are all perfect.

21,=G=,A lot to swallow,7,15 November 2003,"""The English Patient"" is by all accounts a huge movie which has received so much commentary over the past 7 years that there's little point in contributing to the noise. The problem I had with the film was simply it wasn't believable. Everyone in this film does extraordinary and incredibly stupid things, all in the name of force feeding you the film's melodrama. Good in all respect save perhaps it's length and difficult buy-in (I kept wishing he'd just die and get it over with) ""The English Patient"" has been carefully tweaked to make it easy to swallow. So, if you haven't seen the film yet, be prepared to have to chug-a-lug a whole lot of movie for only a moderate payoff. (B)",The English Patient
22,ElMaruecan82,Love as the existential antithesis of war...,10,16 October 2016,"Adapted from Michael Ondaatje's novel, Anthony Minghella's ""English Patient"" belongs to a Hollywood tradition of war-epics sweeping several Oscars, including the so ""year-defining"" Best Picture, and condemned to inspire such questions as: why did this film win the Best picture over ""Fargo"" or ""Jerry Maguire""? Seriously, the only question that deserves to emerge is: does it matter?This is a film that is as much about War as say, ""Jerry Maguire"" is about sports, war is incidental to the people's lives but their lives and their relationships are still the real thing. Remember that line from ""Casablanca"": ""it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world."" All the greatest war movies have contributed to discredit good old Rick; he has a point that on the big scale of war, the global outcome is what really matters but seriously, shouldn't we weep for the people who die on the screen because worse things happen off-screen? People die at war, it's the very essence of war, and if their sacrifice or death allows a few victories on the short term, well, we find the strength to accept the tragedies, but all the acceptance in the world can affect the emotional resonance one's death has on us.Indeed, what is cinema if not a medium intended to make us care for what goes on, and primarily on the screen? ""Schindler's List"" is incredibly sad because of the innocent lives killed over the course of the Nazi's persecutions and executions, but the story is told in such a way that we're also glad for the survivors who, with the help of Schindler, managed to go through the hellish war. Inversely, in ""Saving Private Ryan"", while we're supposed to cheer for his survival, we can't get quite over the loss of all the soldiers who went looking for him. In war films, we care for people not for wars, if anything, wars teach about humanity more than any other genre and ""The English Patient"" is no exception. One of the scene that haunted me the most was during a celebration of peace, everyone was chanting, drinking, dancing and cheering, glad to be finally back home and move forward, and then an explosion pooped the party the worst way. One of the officers hanged the British flag on a booby trap and died instantly. Now, this death had upset me more than any other one and the man wasn't even one of the main characters, but I found his death incredibly sad because it happened 'after' the war, as if the bombs should have been magically defused by the power of peace, as if it happened at a moment where no one was supposed to die anymore. It's the unpredictability of death that made it harder to accept, because all through the film, our minds were set to accept people dying. This one, by catching me off guard, revealed to me the essence of war: it makes death more acceptable.But the power of love is that it can't make death acceptable whether in war or peace time. And in a way, ""The English Patient"" is about deaths that shouldn't have happened if it wasn't for that fateful global conflict. Many people populate the film, and they're never identified by their backgrounds but by the people they love in return, the people they care or cared for, the ones they befriended or been married to. The film is made of two intersected stories, it's about a mysterious aviator (Ralph Fiennes) whose plane has burnt during a secret mission, he is taken care in Italy by a Canadian nurse, Hana, played by Juliette Binoche, who uses a villa as an improvised little hospital. Several men join her, a Sikh bomb expert played by Naveen Andrews and a mysterious man (Willem Dafoe) who seems to have a personal record to settled with the 'English' patient. Their interactions, flashbacks provide enough to make us want more.The main flashback though is told by the patient, from a time where he was a handsome Hungarian archaeologist, falling in loves with Katharine (Kristin Scott Thomas) the wife of his friend (Colin Firth). This is not a movie that romanticizes infidelity, their bonding is as a natural and inevitable process as war or a sandstorm, some things you just can't fight back and that seem as efficient in putting people together as separating them. The nurse Hana is also an illustration for this need of love, this is not the Florence Nightingale syndrome, but a need to find someone who can give as much as she gives, and if this person doesn't die in war, that would be enough. Binoche is such a naturally delicate and lovable actress, such a sweet and kind person that if someone like her ever lost the capability to love because of death, the tragedy would be worse than any death.But that's the secret of ""The English Patient"", by inter-crossing these parallel love and friendship stories, people put their failures into perspective. Even in wars, people don't die completely, their body perish but not their memory, it is a very fitting coincidence that the pre-war period involves map-making, because maps are built on pre-existing territories, you can put any names on them, that doesn't make them exist more. So is love, the memory transcend the actual relationship, it exists as long as you live it, talk about it and let it exist through the memory of other people who'd outlive you. In the film, a solider wants to talk to a man from his town before going, that's what war is about, trying not to completely die. And despite all the deaths that punctuate the story, at the end, Hana lets a beautiful smile illuminate her face, and it's all in the final revelation about the English Patient.",The English Patient
23,g-bodyl,"Bold, Masterful Epic!",9,27 March 2014,"The English Patient is a tale of doomed love and one that brings Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago to mind. Director Anthony Mingella must have drawn inspiration from David Lean because there are so many Lean-like features in the film including an exact eye for detail. This is a sweeping and ambitious film that any lover of film will enjoy. It may be a tad too long and perhaps saccharine at certain points, but this film screams epic at you.Minghella's film starts off during the end of World War Two and after a plane crashes, this nurse named Hana cares for the mortally wounded Count Almasy who tells his story. While in Egypt, he falls in love with this woman named Katharine Clifton who is not happy with her husband. These two begin an affair which may lead to some harsh consequences.This film is well-acted and has some career-best performances worth of many accolades. Ralph Fiennes is essentially playing two people in one body and while not a career-best, it ranks up there in his top-five performances. Juliette Binoche is very good as Hana whom the war has taken a toll on. Kristen Scott Thomas does a good job at seducing the Count. Also, I must mention Willem Dafoe because he does a good job as the guy who is out to seek revenge against the Count.Overall, The English Patient is an ambitious project that is just a step away from perfection. I thought at times the romance wasn't as credible and seemed a little fake. But other than that, this film soars high. it has many stunning sequences, including the sandstorm scene. A very masterful film both technically and story-wise. A very David Lean-like film and that is a compliment. I rate this film 9/10.",The English Patient

This film is long, drawn-out and fairly boring. Yes, it has great production value, but the story isn't as compelling as it thinks it is, and I couldn't identify with any of the characters. I think the 1996 Best Picture award should have gone to Jerry Maguire or Fargo, instead.",The English Patient
25,secondtake,"A highly romantic, layered, dramatic, beautiful experience...sometimes in excess?",8,11 February 2010,"The English Patient (1996)This pulls out every high drama romance issue known to men and women in love, and with great sophistication and beauty. It is set in that most dramatic of times, World War II, and in the most gorgeous of places, North Africa dripping in sand and sun, and Italy in the provinces outside of Florence. The leads are sophisticated and beautiful, too, so if you don't fall in love with the scenery, and don't get sucked in by the layered and heart wrenching plot, you'll come to love at least some of the characters, played by actors of substance, with intensity.So what could go wrong? Some will say nothing. It did win seven (seven!) Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director (for the richly talented Anthony Minghella). Yet both times I saw it I was not quite absorbed. I don't think it is too long, especially, though it is long. Instead I think it is too perfect, which of course is double talk, to say that the flaw of a movie is that it is too perfect. But you can see, maybe, how a movie is just so poised and fluid and cinematically calculated it starts to feel ""knowing"" or somehow aware of its own perfection. Likewise with the plot, screenwritten by Minghella from a novel by Michael Ondaatje, is almost too packed with the worst and best kinds of scenes--abandoned lovers, lovers seeing lovers cheat on them, identities lost, memories told by candlelight, promises made and kept, or not kept, against the most grandiose odds and explosive circumstances. It's amazing stuff, and it begs for honesty, for some cracks in the glass. Too much Tiffany and blood, not enough hesitation and error. Those things make for a different kind of perfection.But then again, this is like finding the flaws in a Hitchcock film. They abound, and they might be interesting, but don't forget the whole, the parts that work, and work you over, and leave you breathless and crying if you let them. The English Patient rises above itself many times. Juliette Binoche is easily the most compelling character in her honesty, and Colin Firth gives a small but charmed performance. Ralph Fiennes is meant to have two different sides to his character (or three, if you include the bed-ridden version), and when he is sparkling and feisty he is alive on the screen. As a brooding, serious man he approaches wooden at times, though some women might disagree. The least known of the four or five main actors, Kristen Scott Thomas, is meant to be exactly what she is--an adventurous and gifted person who everyone likes but who is, at heart, making the most of being away from England, and this unromanticized presence is key. Finally there is Willem Dafoe, who plays that slightly exaggerated, quirky, creepy guy he can do so well.And this of course, just brushes against the iceberg. Like The Talented Mr. Ripley (by the same director), this is a mammoth undertaking, hugely engrossing, but unlike Ripley, this one is at times ironically cold, playing with so many flashbacks its construction starts to intrude. But the movie is still worth seeing for what it pulls off best: high romance, great drama, and another version of true love on the screen.",The English Patient
26,inkblot11,"One of the greatest achievements in all of cinema, peerlessly beautiful",10,7 March 2007,"Count Laszlo (Ralph Fiennes) has just been transferred to a hospital in Italy during World War II. He is horrifically burned from an ambush. His nurse Hana (Juliette Binoche) tends to him, body and mind, for she fears, quite rightly, that he may be a very troubled soul. In the course of his care, the Count starts to tell Hana of his recent past. It seems he worked in a government capacity in Africa, where he met a beautiful married lady named Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas). Although they tried to avoid each other, they fell in love. After a brief affair, Katherine called it quits, leaving the Count desolate. Even so, the two would meet again, under heart-wrenching circumstances. Meanwhile, Hana herself falls for a Sihk man in the British bomb squad. Yet, the war is raging relentlessly. Can love exist when the world is in turmoil? This is a tremendous film, based on an equally fine but complex novel. The plot has many story lines that are woven together beautifully, each of them poignant beyond description. The script itself is elegant and contains many memorable lines. Fiennes is magnificent, both as the burn victim and as the man who thought love was a myth. Scott Thomas is also quite fine as the woman who fights against her passions. As for Binoche, she richly deserved the Oscar that she was presented, as her nurse is a shining example of hope in a hopeless situation. The scenery is utterly gorgeous, as are the costumes, the direction, and the production. If you have missed out on viewing this film, rectify that soon, very soon.

What a picture! 9 Oscars doesn't go so simply to one picture. It's a superb movie making, superb story, and a superb experience all around. Late superb movie maker Anthony Minghella created his masterpiece almost without flaws. Yes, this movie is not for everyone. On the core it's a love story. But at the same time it's so much more. It's represents life and time itself. Every single time i saw this picture, i felt time that is going by, like in this movie, time is irrelevant, and on the same time, no one can escape their destiny, and time itself. Life goes on, and it doesn't really matter if you still here or not, life will go on. This is a haunting movie, it created ideas, feelings in my mind that i will never forget. When we see Hana at the end going in a truck, sun is shining and she is moving by those trees, we see life itself, the world will be still here, only human will change - grab this moment, enjoy it while you can, because time is unstoppable.Overall, 10/10 for ""The English Patient"" - a superb love story, a true art in ideas - it's hard to imagine a true moviegoer who won't appreciate this picture.",The English Patient
28,ironhorse_iv,Zhivago of Arabia,7,28 November 2012,"Burn into the mind of its audience, the film is set before & during World War II depicts the life of a critically burn English patient. (Ralph Fiennes). Ralph was great in the role, and he success portraying the burn victim, earned him yet another Oscar nomination, but his character was morality flawed. The English Patient is being looked after by Hana (Juliette Binoche), a French-Canadian nurse in an abandoned Italian monastery. Throughout, the film, the patient talks to his nurse after his life, through a series of flashbacks. The story is slowly revealed, that he was once a Hungarian, Count László de Almásy, whom cartographer job, went him to the Sahara Desert to make a map of it. While there, he had an secretly affair with a married woman, Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas). This is where the sore good rule of thumb comes in, it's hard to root for a protagonist like Almasy. He's cold, annoying and hardly deserves to fall in love with Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas). Katherine is plagued with the guilt of infidelity, while the Count shows a streak of jealousy along with an imbalance that will later haunt him. The problem with this movie is that it centers on the adultery between the two lead characters and Almasy had cause so much pain to others. David Caravaggio (William Dafoe), a Canadian intelligence operative and former thief, is one of those. Caravaggio lost his thumbs while being interrogated by a German army officer and it was the patient's actions that had brought about his torture. Katherine's husband get wind of the affair, and sudden and dramatic revenge. He crash his plane, with Katherine aboard, into the Count's desert camp, seriously injures Katherine while killing himself. Since the desert camp was in the middle of nowhere, the English patient is forced to live Katherine in a cave, and scorch three day walk to the nearest civilization for help while not falling in the enemy's hand during the oncoming North Africa war between the English and German. This is where the ""hero"" deliberately sells out the British — the West — to the Germans in order to secure the plane necessary to save Katharine. He gives the Nazis (the Nazis!) crucial maps. Afterwards, when he's informed that this act likely caused the death of thousands of Allied soldiers and civilians with a chilled replied. Love remains a ghost in this film, an invisible force that pushes the man to act and to react - without that it can lead, defeat, succeed; the man is the victim of this mysterious power of love... It is a severe message and hard to accept. The patient's story lost some motiving to feel enthusiastic, interested, and committed to something, when it introduces and intercuts sub-plot of Hana and her romance with Kip (Naveen Andrews), an Indian Sikh bomb defuser in the British Army. Due to various events in Hana's past, their romance full of tension and brings more drama in already drama full movie. Juliette Binoche would win for her role, but it felt like a different movie. Hana was warm contrast to the war-blasted backdrop. It should have been. The movie is call 'English Patient' not 'French Nurse'. It doesn't help, move on the story along. The pacing of the movie is so long, that the movie clocks in 2hr 40min. (nearly 3 hours). The English Patient is a story of love, fate, misunderstanding and healing. Told in a series of flashbacks, the film can best be explained by unwinding it into its two chronological phases: before and after the plane crashes. I dislike movies that show you the end of something first. You can pretty much predict what will happen next. The movie also sport narcissism and nihilism ideas while filled with poetic dialogue, lush cinematography, some truly extraordinary scenes. One is the curves of a naked woman are seamlessly transfigured into the erotic contours of a desert landscape. The film stood out on its own merits rather than an adaptation. This film is based on a fairly difficult novel by Michael Ondaatje which doesn't have much dialogue, jumps around in time and takes place all over the world. Whatever possesses someone to try and adapt such a work is beyond my comprehension. Once again, not really an adaptation, but has the sensitive and lyrical charm of Anthony Minghella. The music from the film is heaven, simply incredible achievement. Minor composer as Gabriel Yared could have written one of the most beautiful film scores ever, so touching, so powerful and yet so intimate. The Bach's Aria of Goldberg Variations is very suitable for the story: difficult, excessive, beautiful. The movie has it all, so check it out. It's the kind of film with a prestigious tragic love story, set against an exotic background. It one Best Picture for a reason.",The English Patient
29,paulclaassen,"Wow, what a film!",7,20 December 2020,"'The English Patient' plays like a Shakespearean tragedy. This is a classic tale of forbidden love.The patient in question is Almasy (Ralph Fiennes) and interestingly enough is not English, but dubbed The English Patient through a case of mistaken identity. Almasy's life story is told through memories and flashbacks. Almasy reminisce the past every time a name, sound or image triggers a memory.In addition to his tragic past, we also experience the equally tragic life of the nurse, Hana (Juliet Binoche) who looks after him. Realizing Almasy had very little time to live, she felt sorry for him constantly being loaded and offloaded onto trucks, and decided to care for him in an abandoned building instead, until his death.'The English Patient' is therefore two tales wrapped into one tragic story, which spans several years.

30,Dr_Coulardeau,The film has aged ideologically,8,19 September 2008,"It is an interesting film, but not more than that. What does it shows? That the English were particularly sectarian during WW2 on the African front. Nothing new under the sun. Anyone who had a slightly different name or a slightly surprising or uncommon attitude was at once considered as a spy unworthy of any trust. This created myriads or even legions of misunderstandings and human errors along with cruelty, barbaric acts, violence, etc. The only interest of this film is the technical brilliance in the use of flashbacks that only happen in the head of this English patient who plays the loss of his memory to protect himself against his own name and his own ascendants. Yet his survival is not possible and the nurse who is looking after him is little by little led to being convinced by him that she has to overdose him with morphine, which she does. The sentimental elements along the way for the nurse or the Sikh bomb and mine technician are there only to provide a present time line onto which the flashbacks can be woven and attached. The acting is absolutely outstanding, even if the story is rather trite.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",The English Patient

Based on a novel by Michael Ondaatje (which I have), its located in Italy at the end of World War II, telling the story of a military nurse being in a ruined house to assist an aviator who was terribly injured in a plane crash. So, this movie was intended for a public that wants to follow the story, savor all moments, follow the emotions of the characters. The script makes a good adaptation of the book. Scenarios and costumes have been thought through to detail and the period elements have been well recreated and are historically suitable. Visually, the film is excellent: great cinematography, with Italian and North African landscapes dazzling the audience. Ralph Fiennes was excellent in the lead role, achieving one of the most remarkable works of his career. Juliette Binoche was not as surprising as him, but she was well in her role.

This near two three quarter hour movie, is one you become more engrossed in, the longer you watch. One reason, is to find the catalyst, responsible for a plane that goes down, where survivor Fiennes (yeah, the reputable guy on airlines) a lone author who becomes involved in a fatal affair, that claims beauty, Kristin Scott Thomas, never looking sexier, here. He's working with an archaeologist team, from what I can see, in the wide spanning desert of Cairo, not a place you want to brake down in, Summer or fall, where it's headed by Firth, Kristin Scott's Thomas's husband. The fatal affair intensifies, as we go back and forth with a bed ridden, skinless, Fiennes who has practically lost his face, and other features, burnt beyond recognition (think the sloth victim in Se7en) where he's nursed by army sister, (Binoche, a wonderful actress) who has her eyes on someone else. She plays a quite damned, if a little reserved nurse, whose time and dedication to her patients, where I'm really talking Fiennes here, is much admired. Willem Dafoe plays a bit of a shadowy character, out for revenge against Fiennes, where I could piece the whole following scenario, as experiencing this love triangle in other films, but there's a little bit more to it, which I liked, Dafoe's reasons for his black woolen mitts. Here's a great film, with great actors and characters, especially the ambiguous one of Fiennes, which should be viewed, by those who haven't seen it, even 20 years after it's release. It's ending is sad and memorable, if bleak too, especially if you consider Fienne's fate. Great film, that will stay with you, after seeing it.",The English Patient

He is cared for by Hana (Juliette Binoche), a French-Canadian nurse, who set out to care for the man in an abandoned monastery in rural Italy. The two develop a bond and he slowly regains his memory where he was a geographer in Egypt, making maps of the desert. He remembers having an affair with Katharine (Kristin Scott Thomas) who was married to his best friend Geoffrey (Colin Firth). The affair was the reason for why he was injured. As well as the memories and the story in North Africa, Hana starts to have a relationship with Kip (Naveen Andrews), a Sikh Indian engineer who was in the British Army. But she struggles to truly led herself go. The other person at the monastery is David Caravaggio (William Dafoe), a Canadian Intelligence Operative from Italian descent.

35,ackstasis,"""Every night I cut out my heart. But in the morning it was full again""",9,2 July 2007,"Anthony Minghella's 'The English Patient' is a film that takes us back to the golden years of Hollywood. It is grand and impressive in scale, and yet so heartbreakingly intimate in its portrayal of human love and suffering. At the 1997 Academy Awards, the film owned the night, taking home nine awards from twelve nominations, the most decisive cleansweep since Bernardo Bertolucci's 'The Last Emperor' in 1988. Based on Canadian author Michael Ondaatje's 1992 Booker Prize-winning novel of the same name, 'The English Patient' is a touching meditation on life, love and loss, tracing the history of a critically-burnt man in the aftermath of World War Two.During the war, a man (Ralph Fiennes) is discovered in the burning remnants of a crashed plane. With his face scarred beyond recognition, and with the man seemingly suffering from amnesia, he is assumed to be an Allied soldier, and is simply referred to as ""the English patient."" After the war, in the mine-ridden hills of Italy, a kind nurse, Hana (Juliette Binoche), who has apparently lost everybody close to her, remains in a ruined monastery to look after the dying man. Over time, she comes to learn more and more about her ""English patient,"" who is actually revealed to be a Hungarian geographer, Count Laszlo de Almásy. Rather than losing his memory in the plane crash, we learn that this scar-ridden man has perhaps chosen to forget his past, both to protect himself from persecution and to cure himself of the tragic memories of his past love. Via numerous flashbacks, we learn of Almásy's former exploits in the Sahara desert, and his romantic liaison with a married woman, Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas).It's certainly easy to see why 'The English Patient' was so successful at the Oscars. It is such a beautiful film, blending the quiet beauty of the Italian countryside with the endless golden sands of the desert. Cinematographer John Seale captures the landscape to perfection; not since David Lean's magnificent 'Lawrence of Arabia' has a film shown the desert with such beauty and grandeur, making particularly good use of sweeping aerial shots from Almásy's plane. Even in the film's more intimate moments, excellent use of close-ups and lighting capture the emotion of the scene, coupled, of course, with the brilliant performances from all the cast members.A long-time favourite actor of mine, 'The English Patient' might just contain Ralph Fiennes' finest performance, and, considering his history includes such films as 'Schindler's List' and 'The Constant Gardener,' this is not a complement that is to be taken lightly. His Count Laszlo de Almásy is initially a very sympathetic character, but, as we slowly learn more about his past, his likable qualities are eroded by his less-admirable tendencies towards others. ""Ownership"" is a major theme of the film. When asked by Katherine what he hates most, Almásy replies with ""Ownership. Being owned. When you leave you should forget me."" However, as the relationship progresses, and Katherine perhaps tries to distance herself from him, Almásy reveals a hint of arrogance, insisting that his love for her somehow entitles him to have her whenever he likes: ""I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine, which belong to me.""Juliette Binoche, who received an Oscar for her performance here, is excellent as Hana, the lonesome nurse who fears to love because of the tragedies that have always harmed those close to her. After some time of caring for Almásy alone, she is joined by a dubious Canadian thief, David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), who lost his thumbs during the war, and who suspects that it was Almásy who betrayed him to the Germans. Hana also strikes up a tentative romantic relationship with Kip (Naveen Andrews), an Indian bomb-diffuser in the British Army. However, due to her past history, Hana is afraid that becoming involved with Kip will doom him to death, particularly considering his very dangerous line of work.At 160 minutes in length, 'The English Patient' wonderfully evokes memories of the classic romantic epics of old, successfully finding a balance of mystery, love, joy and tragedy. The ending of the film is heartbreaking and sorrowful, but also uplifting in its own way. Whilst some romantic relationships are doomed from the very beginning, others have a very good chance of bringing happiness. Nevertheless, in every case, it is always better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all.",The English Patient
36,CubsandCulture,"Ambitious, Achingly Beautiful and a Rebuke of Nationalism",10,7 February 2019,"This was Miramax's first great success and I think it can be argued that the film industry would be very different had this film not won Best Picture. There is a pretty straight line from it to Jackson's Lord of the Rings which had a massive influence. In any case it is wonderful film in its own right that is in some ways as ambitious as the aforementioned Jackson films. It too grapples with a largely unfilmable book that is dense, multifaceted and layered. And pulls it off with uncommon grace and skill.The film, at its heart, is a mediation on loyalty and what it means to make a promise. (And to what you should tie your scared honor). Every one of the wonderful vivid characters is confronted with violating an oath and legal custom. Each is faced with a personal dilemma that connects to WW2 in some way. The way each fails or succeeds at this task provides poignancy to the story and the film is filled with a bittersweet energy that is heartbreaking. Almasy, especially, is a wonderful character caught in the snares of competing loyalties. That he ultimately fails his promise due to his name/national origin solidifies the film's anti-nationalism edge.Apart from the utterly engrossing story, the film is marvel for its budget. I can't believe such a beautiful film was only made for 27 million dollars. It competes with the likes of Lawrence of Arabia and Ben-Hur for the sheer spectacle of the film. The cinematography is wonderfully sensuous and moody. The film is quite slow moving (to the film's strength) but you get lost in the images because of Minghella's eye. The church scene with Hana-Kip especially is the height of romance.This is what an epic should be.",The English Patient

Anthony Minghella weaves extravagant beauty around a central character whose condition is grotesque, and puts emotional barriers between the characters and the audience...This adult love story is an intimate portrait in the tradition of 'Casablanca' and 'Dr. Zhivago.' The film sweeps gracefully attaining a level of eroticism and emotional connection that many similar films had missed... Told in flashback, it is a masterpiece of intimate moment and spectacular largesse...Ralph Fiennes plays the English patient, Count Laszlo de Almasy, a Hungarian cartographer of few words, who works for the British government, and is stationed in the North African desert...Count Laszlo is the unidentified survivor of a plane crash turned over to the Allies, taken into custody by a medical convoy in Italy, and essentially left to die in peace, in an isolated monastery in Tuscany, under the care of an inspiring pretty nurse who injects him with morphine, and reads to him a book, considered his great treasure, and his one surviving possession...Hana seeks to stimulate his touching memories, wrapped up in his head, released in lost pieces from his disturbed mind...Fiennes gives a haunted, pained performance, playing the young man whose veneer of charm cannot plainly cover his heart's capacity for passion... He makes us sympathize with the character in showing self-doubt and weakness... As a badly burned man, he has only cherished memories... His joy and heartbreak are completely clear and visible in his eyes... He remembers falling under the spell of an attractive English married woman... He remembers the way this turns him from a harsh abrupt wanderer into a man willing to betray everything for love... His tragic love affair forms the heart of the motion picture...Kristin Scott Thomas matches Fiennes' work with a radiant sensuality... She is captivating as the married European woman, conveying the audience with the energy and enthusiasm for life that the Count finds irresistible... Their different world, despairing and hopeful, menacing and resilient, is simply beautiful... With intense passion and intelligence, this attractive blonde burns the screen as the different wife...Juliette Binoche seems to shine as the French-Canadian nurse full of life and energy... This vibrant young woman has a heart of gold, kissing wounded soldiers, but she thinks that she is a curse as anybody she ever loved tends to die on her...Colin Firth is good as Katherine's husband... He is a British spy flying into the tough desert in a yellow biplane to take aerial maps of the whole North African continent... He quickly becomes friend of the Count, yet when he realizes that his wife has committed adultery, his face reflected a peaceful fury...William Dafoe plays a double-agent spy who covers his anger with a strange charm... He is a crippled war veteran who has a hidden agenda... This cunning Canadian man seems to know of some dark secret in Almasy's past... He believes the 'English patient' is partially responsible for the mutilation of his hands, and is busy seeking revenge on everyone even remotely involved...Naveen Andrews is Hana's ardent lover He is a handsome Sikh, and an explosives expert with a dangerous job There's a scene that is stuck in my head because it literally had me on the edge of my seat for what seemed an eternity In this particular scene, the military sapper has to cut the wires on a bomb that has been hidden on a bridge It's on a timer and he only has a few minutes left The scene cuts back and forth between his tense face, the wires and his dirty fingers as they try madly to figure out how to untangle and cut the wires without detonating the bomb All the conventional elements of the genre are at peaks of excellence in ""The English Patient."" John Seale's cinematography is breathtaking, and Gabriel Yared's majestic music is dreamy, and romantic This is a rich motion picture with ambition and style, a fever dream, lyrical and complex We are almost able to feel the heat of the desert, the pain of the burnings, the intimate flush of humanity that becomes the most haunting element of this epic love story...",The English Patient
38,dwpollar,Well-written and played out story ...,10,15 March 2001,1st watched 9/2/2000 - (Dir-Anthony Minghella): Well-written and played out story that starts out involving a badly burned pilot and his care mostly given by Binoche.  Everything really revolves around the Binoche character although there are plenty of mini-stories built into the movie and all of them are interesting. Very much like a modern Doctor Zhivago.,The English Patient
39,davispittman,An epic love story,8,18 December 2017,"This winner of nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture, is truly an epic. It stars Ralph Fiennes, Kristen Scott Thomas, Juliette Binoche, Willem Dafoe, and Colin Firth. The plot centers around Fiennes's character, Count Laszlo, falling in love with a married woman, Katherine, played by Thomas. All of this story is told in flashbacks. An older, dying Count Laszlo is being cared for by a war nurse, played by Binoche, who gives a fine performance. Binoche gives the strongest performance of all, earning her an academy award. The script is emotional, touching, and emphasizes the connections between the characters involved. I loved the chemistry between Thomas and Fiennes, it is a wonderful love story to watch. Also, the connection that Hana and Laszlo share is something very special. Love is at the center of this entire film, and it will touch you in a deep way, or at least that's the experience I had with it. I suggest this very well made film to those who like epics. It is not the best film ever, but it is certainly a very good one. 8/10 for The English Patient.",The English Patient
40,gcd70,Superb in almost all respects,7,12 June 2008,"""The English Patient"" is superb in almost all respects. A lavish production that is a feast to the eye, it is a credit to the immensely creative talents of producer Saul Zaentz (""Amadeus"") and visionary director Anthony Minghella.Special effects and stunts are most convincing, and amazing sound supports this where it matters. Costumes are spot on in recreating the late thirties and early forties, while the production design is nothing short of superlative. John Seale's camera sweeps us through this tale of love and war with grand style, capturing some marvellous footage.writer/director Minghella has set out to make an epic of Michael Ondaatje's war time novel, and cleverly he surrounded himself with the people who could pull it off. Along with producer Zaentz and a brilliant technical team, he has an outstanding cast.Ralph Fiennes (""Schindler's List"" and ""Quiz Show"") is far and away the outstanding talent in all the movies in which I have had the pleasure of watching him perform. Not to say his co-stars are poor, it is just that he is so strong. Once again he personifies brilliantly the character of Count Laszlo de Almasy, the hardened Austrian explorer whose mastery of languages is only surpassed by his archaeological expertise. Sturdy in support is Kristin Scott Thomas, as Katherine Clifton, the passionate lover who stirs the Count's emotions to life. Juliette Binoche gives an Academy Award winning performance as Hana, the Canadian army nurse who cares for the critically injured Almasy as he gradually recalls the past. Ever reliable Willem Dafoe is Canadian undercover agent Moose, who blames the Count for a wrong he suffered during the war. Cast also includes Jurgen Prochnow, Colin Firth and Naveen Andrews.The only disappointing part of this film is the shaky plot and lack of characterisation. Minghella's screenplay is never strong, nor is it important enough to be an epic. The characters are poorly developed and hard to empathise with. Not enough background is supplied to explain their actions and reactions. And another thing, I am getting tired of passionate love affairs that involve infidelity. Why is it that nearly all of cinema's great lovers are adulterous? Don't married couples love with vigour? Not according to the movies apparently. In ""The English Patient"", the lover is portrayed as the hero, and the husband as an obsessive, boring old sop. And that is just one of two affairs in the film. Add to that a plug for euthanasia, and immorality just is not in it. Hardly the picture of the year, though it does look like and epic.Sunday, June 8, 1997 - Waverley Pinewood Cinema",The English Patient

43,Steffi_P,"""You loved him""",9,12 February 2012,"Once every five or ten years there is produced an epic, historical romantic tragedy, a movie of incredible beauty and emotional magnitude that tends to make a sweep at the Oscars, usually deserved. The late 80s and early 90s had been suspiciously devoid of any such movie. And then, all of sudden, a bunch of them came along at once. The English Patient sees such a grand romance with the elusive themes and complex structuring more often encountered in the art house.It is not, however, dull or pretentious, possessing a directness and humanity that makes us feel somehow involved. Director Anthony Minghella does not attempt to dazzle us with any form of technical wizardry. His style is simple, thoughtful, with few camera movements. At certain times he places us right within the action, such as at the beginning of the first flashback, where the camera occupies the space of an imaginary extra person as the team discuss their expedition (this is a trick classic master Frank Capra also used, by the way). At other times, particularly in the 1945 scenes at the monastery, his camera looks down upon things, but the sense at these times is not one of cold detachment, but one of giving the characters some space and freedom at moments of high emotion, as when they bring the bedridden Count out in the rain.The English Patient has practically an ensemble cast, with players of many different temperaments contributing something, and no-one quite seeming to be in a lead role. Although she won her awards as a supporting actress, Juliette Binoche provides perhaps the strongest presence throughout the movie. Her character is bereaved several times, and it's admirable how she manages to make the emotion seem genuine even in repetition. Together with Naveen Andrews and Kevin Whately she forms a warm, likable trio that viewers are instantly able to connect with. Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas, the lovers of the primary story, are a sharp contrast. While both are physically very beautiful, there is a stiffness and formality about them both which, despite some wonderful efforts (Fiennes's drunk act is priceless), they never quite break out of enough to make their passion seem truly alive.But perhaps this is part of the point. The English Patient is after all a picture of shifting tones. The scenes of 1945 depict a time for healing, mourning and rebuilding, and as such the only times where real human feeling is allowed to flow. Perhaps it is right that the dead romance of the past should be portrayed with a loftiness as of some ancient legend. Thinking in these terms, it becomes possible to see the movie for its all-round care in construction – the deeply-composed shots within the monastery that look like Vermeer paintings; the Walter Murch editing that seems cut together for harmonies of sound as much as image – a design in which even the style of acting performances is keyed into the dual storytelling. This is a picture in which the artiness and metaphor of highbrow filmmaking meet the grandeur and sentiment of the mainstream, to overwhelming effect.",The English Patient

45,Seraphion,A good entertainment based on a nice romance,7,12 July 2014,"This movie is another romance with the background of World War II. But instead of being caged up in a single location, the story sets back and forth nicely between the past in Northern African desert, and the present story perspective of Italy. Though based on a not so exemplary premise of unfaithfulness the romance stirs up well enough, with the help of the alternating story flow. The mood is very nicely kept to a minimum tension. Despite being based on World War II, and having many opportunities which can have the mood rise up, the movie manages to keep out to a minimum by imploring anti-climaxes here and there. On the acting side, this movie presents us with one of the great works by Ralph Fiennes. Juliet Binoche, Willem Dafoe and Colin Firth also bring out high quality acting on their respective parts. This is truly a nice entertainment worth a watch for me.",The English Patient
46,EdgarST,Endless Map of the Human Heart,2,22 October 2000,"If you are not into necrophilia that strange erotic passion for corpses, that has inspired better films, such as ""Psycho""- you may need the patience of a phlegmatic Englishman to enjoy ""The English Patient"", the never-ending motion picture by Anthony Minghella, writer-director who made an excellent debut with the wonderful and supernatural romantic comedy ""Truly Madly Deeply"", which not too many people saw, because somebody had the not so bright idea of calling it ""the intelligent version of 'Ghost'."" According to Aristotle's definition of drama, drama is action, and action is change: if someone changes in this movie, it is the jinxed Canadian nurse Hana (French actress Juliette Binoche), and this is the story of her exorcism. If this coming and going from scenes in the present to the recent past, has any sense between scenes taking place during the last days of Second World War, when Hana takes care of a burnt count (British actor Ralph Fiennes), and scenes of his past, in which we learn that he is a Hungarian archaeologist who discovered a cave with little drawings, that he wrote a book without adjectives, that he collaborated with Rommel and that he had an affair with a married English woman--, if this jumble has an end, it is to free Hana from her evil spell, haunted by death and bad luck. Hana's lover dies in the first reel, and her best friend, another nurse, is disposed of after a few minutes of projection, when she dies on a mined road in Italy. Hana decides to stay in an abandoned church with the count and a good amount of morphine, to wait until the count dies. In the meantime, he remembers, remembers, remembers and remembers, in one of the most repetitive and boring scheme of cinematic flashbacks in recent years, in a story overloaded with subplots, maps, recognition flights, spying, colonialism, drug addiction, panoramic views of Africa, and clothes, cars and planes from the 1940's, probably placed there for us to say ""Wow, great production design!"" or ""Great production values!"" This paraphernalia makes little else but divert the attention from Hana, the only character who goes through a true process of change. But the development is diffuse and distributed among too many flashbacks, and the film loses cohesion and focus. If the flashbacks are highlighted by the presence of British actress Kristin Scott Thomas as the attractive and interesting Katherine, the count's lover, unfortunately she dies too soon, when she spends too many days in the desert, in the cave with little drawings that her lover found. When the count finds her body, he lays by its side, cries and then, taking it in his arms, goes to the exterior and makes such a strange face, that one does not know if it should be taken as a great romantic scene, if it is because of the sun on his eyes or due to the decaying body's odor. All of this is supposed to be based on true facts, according to Sri Lanka writer Michael Ondaatje. I tell you, you really need English patience! While Hana, faithful to her death passion, falls in love with Kip (Anglo-Indian actor Naveen Andrews), a sikh expert in detecting mines, risking his life from day to day, all kinds of characters appear and disappear from the frame, as the ones played by American Willem Dafoe, German Jürgen Prochnow and Italian Nino Castelnuovo, in case you did not know this is an international super-production (that was advertised with an ""independent"" tag Independent from what?) Poor Ralph Fiennes, as the toasted count, spends much of his screen time under a latex mask, with convenient white veins that shine in night scenes. Although the movie has good intentions and fine scenes especially those related to the romance of the count and Katherine-, and in spite of the many Oscars it won (it was not a very good year in Hollywood), for your own good, you better make a trip to the nearest cemetery.",The English Patient
47,Movie-ManDan,An Underrated Masterpiece!,10,27 January 2015,"The English Patient is a 1996 adaptation from the book of the same name that has a reputation as being too long, boring, overrated, and one of the worst movies to win so many Academy Awards including Best Picture and Director. I agree with some of these negative claims up to a certain extent, but the movie has redemption.The English Patient is about a mysterious man (Fiennes) with no identity who is horribly burnt after a plain crash and is cared for by a french-Canadian nurse (Binoche). He reveals that he is Count Almasy and tells the story of his affair with married Katherine (Thomas) and their journeys in the Sahara desert and the surrounding corruption and betrayal.I will agree that The English Patient is too long. 163 minutes is a bit of a stretch and causes there to be some boring moments. If twenty minutes of the movie was cut, the result would have been better. But the length does not make for anything bad. That is what people overstate. That is why the episode of Seinfeld when Elaine hated The English Patient was so funny. Dissing this movie just because it's a bit long and has dull moments is far-fetched. Like Lawrence of Arabia and The Searchers, The English Patient is full of glamorous and lovely shots of the sun-filled desert. If you find this movie boring, it is not bad to look away from. The flashback story of the patient's pre-burn days is the better half of the movie and is wondrous. The burn days for him aren't very wondrous, but are still worth seeing.The English Patient won many awards, beating everybody's favourite, Fargo. Fargo is a true masterpiece, but The English Patient isn't that far behind it. I watched The English Patient twice; I enjoyed it the first time, but loved it the second. It was a major leap. Just why did The English Patient win Best Picture and Best Director? Simple: The English Patient has more to it. In fact, The English Patient was more deserving of its win for Best Director. Although the Coen brothers filmed Fargo to a very high degree, Anthony Minghella provides calibre filming, enchanting shots on location, beautiful costumes, haunting make-up, unbeatable sets, and glowing music. Fargo does not have all these. What Fargo does have may outweigh everything else in 1996, The English Patient offered more than any other movie in 1996.4/4",The English Patient
48,eric262003,Powerhouse Love Story,9,26 March 2018,"Many filmmakers had lost the true meaning of effective powerfully executed love stories delivered with passion and depth. Under the direction of Anthony Minghella, ""The English Patient"" has resurrected the romantic drama by not dependent on just the direction itself (though Minghella won the Oscar for Best Director) but the clever script by Minghella, undeniable performances with pitch-perfect dialogue, flawless camera work that has sweeping levels of erotica mixed with an emotional connectivity you don't see in a lot of in movies.Sure it's grandeur in terms of melodramatic intentions, but it does a service to the movie as opposed to just rubbing it into our faces, which makes it effective instead of manipulative. Put in the rightful hands of writer/director Anthony Minghella based on the award-winning novel by Michael Ondaatje, Minghella brings the romance between Almasy (Ralph Fiennes) and Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas) to life so naturally, it feels like they are living the parts and not just memorizing their lines.The opening scenes are set in World War II as we see a fighter plane from Great Britain being shot down in the deserts of North Africa. The pilot is a Hungarian Count named Laszlo Almasy (Fiennes) who survived the ordeal, but suffered terrible wounds. We meet Laszlo again in Italy in 1944, his wounds have healed up nicely, but happiness isn't going his way. He is terminally ill and has lapsed into memory loss. A weary Canadian nurse named Hana (Juliette Binoche) escorts Laszlo to a secluded peaceful church to live out his last days. While fueling his veins with morphine and reading volumes from his favourite author Herodotus, Hana is determined to regain Laszlo's memories back. They are not alone in this church as company started coming which includes a mysterious crippled soldier named Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe) who's agenda remains esoteric and two bomb analysts that include British Sgt. Hardy (Kevin Whatley) and his Sikh assistant, Kip (Naveen Andrews) who falls in love with Hana.The story is executed through a series of flashbacks used effectively, Laszlo starts to make progress in his memories, though Caravaggio believes that Laszlo is not an amnesiac, but just wants to forget what really happened. The story shifts between the present and the events that happened during the 1930's and 1940's when Laszlo was on a map-making mission while on assignment in the Sahara, that was where he meets Katherine Clifton (Scott-Thomas) who's husband (Colin Firth) is part of this initiative. This sets the bar for Laszlo and Katherine to fall head over heals with each other while in the midst of some serious Nazi ruthlessness.If there was a red herring about ""The English Patient"" is that Laszlo's dying scenes are not as etched out as his flashback sequences. The romantic entanglements between Hana and Kip is way underdeveloped due mostly because they are not fleshed out characters. Therefore, the scenes in the present are really there for filler.Performance wise Ralph Fiennes was excellent as Laszlo another film that Fiennes likes to challenge himself with and here he's put to the test in a very complex role as a strong, introverted type until the right woman comes along and sweeps him off his feet. Kristin Scott-Thomas shines as Laszlo's love interest as she conveys beauty along with just the right amount of poise and energy that Laszlo finds hard to resist.Though her role was minimal, Juliette Binoche is still effective in her performance as Hana. William Dafoe adds just the right amount of intensity in his performance like he does in all his movies which he's pretty good at. Rounding out the notable supporting characters are Naveen Andrews as Kip, Colin Firth as Katherine's husband and Julian Wadham as Laszlo's friend Madox.It's rare to find intelligent epic romantic tales play out so convincingly these days. The thoughts drawn out in this movie will likely have a lingering effect on the viewers once the credits roll. It's one of those films that hits you when you watch it and it hits you once the film ends. This film came right out by award season and rightfully so after spending eight months with bad to mediocre film. This film truly saves the day.",The English Patient
49,JuguAbraham,"Superb in some departments, below average in others",7,14 September 2001,"After viewing a 9 Oscar winner, you begin to wonder how Hollywood thinks and rates a movie. There are some aspects of this film where the Oscar was richly deserving: the intelligent editing, good music, good photography, a rich bouncy performance by Juliet Binoche, who was even better in ""Chocolat."" The opening sequences were absolutely breathtaking--was it a single shot? or beautifully edited to look like a single shot?   How in the world this movie was rated better than ""Fargo"" the other film in competition, in other departments, I cannot comprehend. Does ""love"" for a woman mean more than giving war secrets to the enemy? Does marital betrayal get condoned? It is amazing that Hollywood sometimes chooses to reward subjects than filmmaking: ""Gandhi"" is an example. Here filmmaking gets appreciated but the content is rarely analyzed.As for performances Naveen Andrews as Kip was striking; so was Kristin Scott Thomas (who gave a better performance in Polanski's ""Bitter Moon""). Both never won awards in this film.In short this is a good movie in several departments--with lackluster direction and a not-so-uplifting subject.",The English Patient
50,philip_vanderveken,"Not as perfect as I hoped it would be, but certainly enjoyable",7,18 July 2005,"I don't really know why, but it has taken almost 10 years before I finally watched this movie. I guess this happened because I just didn't have the time for it, although I must admit that I didn't really want to make the time for it either. I'm a fan of war movies and I knew very well that this was one too, but the fact that it isn't one in the most strict sense of the word somewhat scared me off. But only a couple of days ago I saw a similar movie, ""The End of the Affair"", which was also situated in that time period, which didn't exactly show the war either and which also featured Ralph Fiennes. I really liked that movie a lot and for me that was enough reason to finally give this film a try.""The English Patient"" starts at the end of WWII when an unknown and dying man, who doesn't remember anything of what has happened to him or who he is, is treated in a military hospital for severe burning wounds. When his situation is somewhat stable, he and a lot of other patients are being moved by truck to another hospital. But when a car in the column of trucks drives on a mine, somewhere in the middle of the Italian countryside, the whole expeditions stops until the road is cleared from mines. The Canadian nurse who takes care of the unknown man, finds an empty and old monastery and decides that she will stay there with him until the man dies. She soon wins his confidence and that's how it almost immediately gets clear that the man knows a lot more about his past than what he wanted to admit to his interrogators. Through flash backs we get to know that he is an Hungarian who was employed by the Royal Geographical Society as a map maker in the 1930's. He had to chart the vast expanses of the Sahara Desert with several other prominent explorers. Gradually the riddles of the past are unraveled and his role in the war is getting more obvious...Somehow I was a bit disappointed by this movie. It was far from bad, but it wasn't exactly what I hoped it would be. Somewhere I missed something in it, although I find it very hard to say what that exactly was. I guess the best way to describe this feeling is by saying that, because of the continuous switching between present and flash back, I wasn't completely sucked into the story this time. It broke all continuity in the story and that did bother me a bit too often. But don't get me wrong, this is still a movie that is far above average and worth watching for several reasons. One of those reasons is the acting. Ralph Fiennes, Juliette Binoche, Willem Dafoe, Kristin Scott Thomas,... They are all very fine actors who I liked in almost every movie that I watched them play in and this movie wasn't an exception to that rule. Perhaps they aren't very well known to the average viewer who only watches commercial Hollywood toppers, but people who also like more 'alternative' movies, will certainly know their names. But next to the fine acting, this movie also offers some great scenes and images. I like the way they shot the Sahara with its sand storms and sand dunes, but I also enjoyed the images of the Italian countryside. I truly believe that those images added a lot to the value of this movie and its story, which was also more than OK of course.All in all this is a movie that may not be as perfect as I hoped it would be, but that still offered me a good time while watching it. I wouldn't recommend it to the people who only like war movies when there are some big fight scenes to be seen in it, because they will be very disappointed, but when you like a more alternative war movie so now and then, than this might be a good movie to watch. I give it a rating in between a 7/10 and a 7/5.10.",The English Patient
51,denis888,Intense Drama In The Times Of War,7,22 September 2007,"The English Patient is one of those films that mostly deserve all the highest praise. I say, most, because this movie, albeit very serious, intense, deep and really thoughtful, still suffers some drawbacks. First and foremost, why, oh why are the modern films so long? This one lasts for more than two hours and from time to time it becomes really hard to concentrate and follow the extremely serious plot. I say, if the film were an hour shorter, that would serve it only good. However, we have what we have. The winner of several Oscars, The English Patient is still very good. It is a deep, insightful treatise of human soul, love and betrayal, war and cowardice, violence and bravery. Ralph Fiennes is a smashing superb actor. His hero, neurotic and silent, is an enigmatic person, ready for everything only to save the life of his lover. He is great, even though half the time he is a deformed cripple. He is the strongest link here. Juliette Binoche is as usual very convincing and sweet. She adds a lot with her excellent play and the love story plot with that Sikh officer. Willem Defoe, Colin Firth, Christine Scott Thomas are all here, all enormous and all very strong. And then there is desert of Egypt, then there is deep, cloudless sky, green groves of Italy. The nature is here, even when people die, bombs roar, land mines explode. War is here, too. It is obvious, terrible, and bloody. Then, there are corpses, horrible gory bodies, then nude bodies, adultery and all. I do not know what to say. So much of a splendid actors' work, so much of realism, so much of brutality that war brings. This is not a film for relaxation. It makes you think.",The English Patient
52,DeeNine-2,In some ways superior to the book,8,2 February 1999,"This is a beautiful film, reminiscent of something by David Lean, and in some ways superior to the book, which more closely concentrated on Kip, the sapper, and Hana, the nurse; whereas the film likes the story of Catherine, the spoiled, and Count Almasy, the bitter, better.I think the film is right for a popular audience. But essentially these are similar works done in different genres. By the way, the book disappoints with its phony PC notions about how Kip and some others might have reacted to the atomic bombing of the Japanese cities, the author imagining that Kip would be offended that the bomb was dropped on ""brown people"" and not on Europeans; but in truth, few at the time really comprehended nor cared about anything other than ending the horror of the worst war in human history. And I would ask the author, would he like to have stormed the island of Japan? It would have been Corregidor, Iwo Jima, etc. (average Allied death toll at about 33%) a hundred times over.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

Were it not for the high calibre of actors on show, the end result would doubtless be even worse to sit through.  Despite the best efforts of Fiennes and Co, I was never far from either sleep or irritation throughout the entire running time.It figures that Oscar should go such a bundle on something like this.  It seemed to me to be all surface 'gloss' and precious little substance.P.S. - Any Brits remember the old ""Turkish Delight"" ads on T.V?

54,TheUnknown837-1,"despite a few flaws, ""The English Patient"" proves itself as an enthralling modern-day epic with that same sweeping sense that made movies like ""Lawrence of Arabia""",8,26 May 2009,"One of the most charming and, for me at least, the most powerful elements of Anthony Minghella's enthralling Best Picture-winner ""The English Patient"" is that, in the mid 90s, when Hollywood was in the initial stage of having lost its nerve for grand new projects, a film was created that brought back traces—very powerful traces—of the sweeping, wonderful majesty that crafted movies such as ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962) and ""The Ten Commandments"" (1956). ""The English Patient"" contains very much of what made those films so powerful. It has that glorious feeling, a stretched running time that hardly seems long at all, and fascinating characters with pasts and stories.""The English Patient"", based on a novel by the same name by Michael Ondaatje, is like ""The Godfather: Part II"" (1974) in the sense of how it's constructed. It's a blending of two stories: the past and the present and it all revolves around the titular character: an English patient in the post years of World War Two. Ralph Fiennes plays the English patient, who has been scarred for life by a plane crash, and being taken care of in an isolated church by a single nurse played marvelously by Juliette Binoche. Apart from bonding with her raspy-voiced, troubled patient, Binoche comes to learn about his past when a stranger (Willem Dafoe) arrives and the two men appear to know each other.That's just one of the two beautifully crafted stories that shape this film. The other one, told in flashback, is the patient's past, before he was scarred and dying in a bed. The story of the present mixed with the patient's past and his love affair that tragically changed his life forever.To be blunt, ""The English Patient"" is a love story blended with a sweeping epic sensation and it blends magnificently. What I really admired about the love story between Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas was how passionate, how obsessive, how enchanting it was shown on screen. Usually in love stories, such as Minghella's later ""Cold Mountain"" (2003), the romantic elements seem far more lustful than obsessive to me. Some of the love scenes feature elements that may tend to be associated more with lust than love, but still, because it is so well developed and not rushed and not exploited out of proportion, we can believe that there is a sure, true love between these characters. It reminded me a lot of ""Vertigo"" (1958) in how well the filmmakers and performers convinced us that these were two actual human beings who truly fell in love with each other.Performances all around were great. I was especially enthralled by the performance by Juliette Binoche, who took home the Oscar for her performance the following year. I also liked Willem Dafoe playing the sort of cynical, questionable character that he's always quintessential at playing. And of course I can't leave out Fiennes and Scott Thomas and their portrayals of two very passionate lovers.Despite my enormous enthusiasm for this epic, I would be dishonest if I were to describe it as a perfect film. There are two flaws that I cannot glance over. Number one, it is a little too long and the reason for this is my second complaint, there are a few unnecessary subplots. I was not enchanted or particularly interested with the second love story between Binoche and a bomb specialist played by Naveen Andrews. My research has led me to assume that this plot element comes from the original book and I'm sure it worked perfectly in there, but in the film, it just seems a littledistracting and the relationship between the two characters didn't fascinate me. I was far more interested by Fiennes character and his relationships with his two leading actresses.Nevertheless, these two flaws are easily forgivable even if they do slow things down a bit. Those put aside, ""The English Patient"" is an extraordinary achievement of film-making. To me, it was sort of like an insane mix up between ""Casablanca"" (1942) and ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962), two remarkable and better films, and this effective blend proved to be well worth my time. It is a real shame that Anthony Minghella has left us. For he was a truly gifted filmmaker. This is all the evidence anybody needs.",The English Patient
55,jaredmobarak,For the heart is an organ of fire  The English Patient,9,26 October 2008,"The titular English patient is Count Laszlo de Almásy who we are introduced to as his plane is shot down in a fiery crash, leaving his entire body badly burned. It appears as though he has lost his memory too, except for an uncanny ability to name every song he hears. Almásy loves to sing, as he is told throughout the film, in both his past and present, so this trick is not too out of place. He is on his last leg, the crash left him close to death, and eventually the military caravan he is apart of goes on while he and his nurse stay holed up in an abandoned Italian Villa. The nurse, Hana, has seen her own bits of tragedy during the war as her love was killed and then her best friend, seconds after talking to her, is blown up by a land mine. Everyone she loves seems to be perishing around her, so to get away with her patient is an appealing answer to the grief and anger bottled inside. The two are very alike, especially after we hear Almásy speaking of his wife, who we can only assume was the woman in the plane with him when it crashes. We won't know the truth until we delve into the dreamstate memories of his past, the years leading up to the point he is at now. His days as a mapmaker in Africa and the affairs and dealings he participates in once the war breaks.There are a lot of timeline maneuvering, but it's always grounded through our lead character Almásy. Ralph Fiennes is either under burn victim prosthetics (the present) or shown whole in the desert (the past). The surrounding roles also help as we soon realize the instances with Kristen Scott Thomas delineate the past from those moments with Juliette Binoche's Hana, caring for our lead in Italy. The way Fiennes dreams all his flashbacks make it tough for we the audience to decide whether he has amnesia or is just faking it to try and forget the pastan idea set forth by Willem Dafoe's mysterious Caravaggio, a man that is not telling the complete truth, yet entrenching himself in the middle of the action. His past shows him in the deserts converting photographs into maps for the British army to use for the war that is brewing. It is a life of work amongst men and friends until a couple benefactors, one a photographer, come to visit. The arrival of Geoffrey and Katharine Clifton (Colin Firth and Scott Thomas respectively) turns the entire dynamic on its head. Fiennes' strict bachelor finds a woman who fascinates him. A strong, educated, and independent one that just might feel the same about him.This is not just any affair, though, but instead one with dire consequences. Those that Almásy and Katharine touch will all be affected because of the war and the sides that are forming. What was once a world of equality and kinship, with multiple ethnicities and nationalities all teaming up on the cartology project, becomes one of enemies and allies on opposite ends of a harsh brutal battle. The reverberations from their trysts are felt for years to come as grudges stay held and alliances are made. Why does Almásy keep referring to a wife when we know he never has one? What relationship does Caravaggio truly hold with him, if any? Why are he and Katharine flying in territory that risked them getting shot down and killed? There are so many questions for which hinge on Almásy remembering his past. We want him to remember because we want to know what happened to bring him to where he is, alone and disfigured, only wanting one more day in the rain before he dies.But it is not all about this journey. We also are treated to Binoche's Hana's evolution as a woman trying to survive a war that appears to kill everyone she holds dear. What was to be a retreat of isolation beside her patient becomes a boarding house for Dafoe's character as well as a team of bomb diffusers led by Naveen Andrews' Kip. Everyone's favorite Iraqi torturer from ""Lost"" was billed higher than Firth in an Oscar winning film back in 1996. Where has he been since? I don't know, but I'm glad he has returned to the scene because he shows again here that he deserves to be. An Indian Sikh, he becomes the person that could show Hana she is not cursed. He can be a love that won't go away, one to break her from the shell she has hidden herself behind. Theirs becomes a relationship that mirrors Almásy's own with Katharine, allowing his thoughts to dwell on that happy time and eventually let spill what really happened.Six people's lives intertwine through over a decade in Europe and Africa, meeting accidentally and purposely with both large and small results. Each has a hand in the future of the other, whether they are aware of it or not. One move by any of them can be a life or death decision for the rest. As a result, this story could have become contrived to the point of absurdity in order to make it all happen. However, this fact is what makes the film so successful, because it never falls into that trap. The English Patient is natural and fluid throughout its lengthy duration with each coincidence and uncovered secret seeming to be as realistic as possible. I never once doubted the activities nor motives of any involved and while it may drag a bit around the hour and a half mark, the final 45 minutes or so make up for everything. Something can be said for the hidden truth being revealed after so much anticipation and buildup. Minghella took the novel and crafted a riveting piece of romantic drama, captivating its audience and delivering on every promise  absolutely.",The English Patient
56,jhclues,A Magnificent Motion Picture,10,29 July 2002,"In a style reminiscent of the best of David Lean, this romantic love story sweeps across the screen with epic proportions equal to the vast desert regions against which it is set.  It's a film which purports that one does not choose love, but rather that it's love that does the choosing, regardless of who, where or when; and furthermore, that it's a matter of the heart often contingent upon prevailing conditions and circumstances.  And thus is the situation in `The English Patient,' directed by Anthony Minghella, the story of two people who discover passion and true love in the most inopportune of places and times, proving that when it is predestined, love will find a way.It's WWII; flying above the African desert, Hungarian Count Laszlo de Almasy (Ralph Fiennes) is shot down, his biplane mistaken for an enemy aircraft. And though he survives the crash, he is severely burned.  To his great good fortune, however, he is rescued by a tribe of nomads and winds up in a hospital.  But existing conditions are governed by circumstances of war, and Almasy soon becomes one of many patients being transported via convoy to a different facility.  Upon reaching Italy, he is too weak and ill to continue on, and a Canadian nurse, Hana (Juliette Binoche), volunteers to stay behind with him at an abandoned monastery.Hana soon discovers that her charge is something of a man of mystery, as Almasy remembers nothing of his past, and not even his own name.  Thought to be English, the only clues pointing to who he is are contained in a book found in his possession after the crash, but even they are as cryptic as Hana's patient.  Slowly, however, under prompting from Hana, Almasy begins to remember bits and pieces of his life, and his story begins to unfold. And his memory is helped along even more by the appearance of a mysterious stranger named Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), who suspects that Almasy is the man he's been looking for-- a man with whom he wants to settle a score. But, burned beyond recognition, Almasy may or may not be that man. Meanwhile, Almasy's memories continue to surface; memories of a woman he loved, Katherine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas)-- as well as memories of Katherine's husband, Geoffrey (Colin Firth).  And, crippled in mind and body as he is, those memories become the only thing left to which he can cling with any hope at all, even as his life seems to be slipping farther away with each passing moment.In addition to directing, Anthony Minghella also wrote the screenplay for this film, which he adapted from the novel by Michael Ondaatje.  The result is an epic saga presented in the tradition of Lean's `Doctor Zhivago' and `Lawrence of Arabia'; a magnificent film that fills the screen and the senses with unprecedented grandeur and beauty.  Simply put, Minghella's film is genius realized; crafted and delivered with a poetic perfection, watching it is like watching a Monet come to life.  From the opening frames, Minghella casts a hypnotic spell over his audience that is binding and transporting, with a story that has an emotional beauty that equals the engagingly stunning and vibrant images brought to life by John Seale's remarkable cinematography; images that virtually fill the screen as well as the soul of the viewer.  In every sense, this is a film of rare eloquence, with a striking emotional capacity that facilitates an experience that is truly transcendental.  Nominated in twelve categories, it deservedly received a total of nine Oscars, including Best Picture, Director, Supporting Actress (Binoche) and Cinematography.If one had to choose a single word to describe the `essence' of this film, it would be `excellence.'  Even an extraordinary film, however, does not receive nine Oscars without performances that are extraordinary in kind; and the performances given by Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas here transcend the term `Oscar worthy.'  Nominated for Best Actor for his portrayal of Almasy (Geoffrey Rush was awarded the gold for `Shine'), Fiennes has never been better, achieving an emotional depth with his character that is nearly palpable.  Private and introspective, Almasy is not by his very nature an individual to whom the audience will be able to form an intimate connection; Fiennes, however, finds a way to open that emotional door just enough to let you in, enough so that you taste the honest passion welling up within him.  And it works.  Almasy does not seek your friendship; he will, however, gain your compassion.Kristen Scott Thomas, too, received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress (Frances McDormand received the award for `Fargo') for her portrayal of Katherine, a woman whose stoic countenance masks the emotional conflict raging within her, born of the forbidden passion that enslaves her and yet to which she gives herself willingly, casting off her shackles of repression to embrace a love so strong it threatens to consume her.  The reserve Katherine must maintain evokes the empathy of the audience, as Scott Thomas successfully mines the emotional depths of her character to the greatest possible effect.  It's the kind of performance that draws you in and holds you fast, taking you as it does beyond that curtain of hypocrisy that dictates what must be if only for the sake of appearances, and allows you to experience a true sense of unbridled passion.  Understated and shaded with subtlety, it's terrific work by Kristin Scott Thomas.Binoche gives a stunning, affecting performance, as well, as the kindhearted nurse, Hana; it is her humanity, in fact, which defines love in it's purest sense and offers a balanced perspective of it within the context of the film.  Her relationship with Kip (Naveen Andrews) affords us a glimpse of passion of another kind, which contrasts effectively with the intensity of that between Almasy and Katherine.  `The English Patient' is a film that will move you and fill you emotionally; one you will not want to see end. 10/10.",The English Patient
57,rupie,takes plenty of patience to make it thru....,4,30 June 1999,"I finally rented this one to see what all the fuss was about. I am still wondering. That this flat, boring, glacially-paced, lifeless, leaden effort should be considered one of the great movies of the age is a depressing thought. A great film leaves itself imprinted in the mind; I saw this several months ago and I remember a) the opening plane crash & b) the closing death scene. The interminable 2+ hour (seemed like 4 at the time) gap in between is just a blur. So much for moviemaking in this day and age.",The English Patient
58,agmoldham,See this at the Cinema,7,22 December 2003,"One of the best Oscar 'Best Pictures' of recent times. This is a film that is best appreciated at the theatre. The small screen cannot do justice to the cinematography. The film really consists of two stories. The main story is told in flashback as the English Patient spends the last few days of the war (and his life) in a bombed out Italian villa. This is the story of the affair between Count Laszlo de Almásy (Fiennes) and Katharine Clifton (Scott Thomas). There is certainly chemistry between the leads and Katharine isn't the usual one dimensional Hollywood female role. The other story between Hanna (Binoche) and Kip Singh is certainly not as convincing. Willem Dafoe is the glue between the stories who wants to find out whether the English Patient is Almásy. Sorry to harp on, but the real star of the film is the cinematographer and if this didn't win that award from the Academy I'd be amazed.",The English Patient

He is severely burned, and she is his nurse. Willem Dafoe arrives and gets Fiennes to tell what happened in the desert in the cave with the swimmers. Colin Firth is the Kristen Scott Tomas husband. The affair between Fiennes and Scott Thomas is at the core of the story. The war and the desert change people, and love arises surprising even the most faithful. Herodotus is quoted, and his book is pivotal. The vast expanse of history and the desert and wind connect visually. Minghella created a masterpiece. I especially love the scene where Binoche swings on a rope in a church. Pure magic. Willem Dafoe dancing with Binoche is also unforgettable. The love scenes with Fiennes and Scott Thomas are rough. She hits him. Their passion is unlike her marriage to her best friend from childhood Firth. For me the Herodotus book is key to the point of the story. When we grasp the historical scope of the human condition, each death is then connected to all deaths.Although our death is connected to all who have gone before us, we must each face our death alone.",The English Patient

61,Pedro_H,Superb bit-of-everything cinema that treats you like an adult.,9,30 December 2003,"During WW2 a spy and the wife of a diplomat have a Middle Eastern affair that has far reaching consequences for themselves and all those around them.If I was to defend the Oscar Academy it would be that it  gives an impetus (through awards and nominations)  to people to see ""difficult"" films that go beyond spending two hours out of the rain with your brain in neutral.I have nothing against slick no-brain junk (there is good no-brain junk and bad no-brain junk) but cinema needs to be able to prove that it can, occasionally, produce depth, quality and meaning. You don't have to like the English Patient and you don't have to think it is an important film, but if you think Die Hard is a better film (and that is what the IMDB votes say!) then there can be no hope for cinema. Not as an important art form at least.The image of this film is of a stiff romantic talk-piece (partly the fault of the promotion people) but it is not, lots happens and there is no time when you can predict what is going to happen next. This is a three hour movie because it needs three hours to tell the story and get inside the many characters. I wouldn't suggest that this film is perfect. The bomb disposal scenes are pure cod drama and plenty is borrowed from other people's movies - Out of Africa and the general works of David Lean kept springing to mind. I have no idea whether Binoche (here playing a nurse) can really act, because I have never actually seen her do any. She is reduced to looking on with care or looking wide eyed with wonder, maybe that is enough for some people?
(Clearly it was for the Oscar people - she won the Best Supporting Actress award!)Lead Fiennes manages to produce a performance of total paradox in managing to be both cold and romantic as well as conveying emotion through horrific burns make up. I am not so sure about the accent, but I am not sure what an Hungarian linguist sounds like when speaking English! Lover Kristin Scott-Thomas has less to do, but I loved her restraint: sexy and passionate while never throwing anything in your face.The English Patient is one of those films you walk away from thinking ""I didn't know they still made films like that"", I hope that I can say it again some time soon, but I am not holding my breath.",The English Patient

When I eventually got around to seeing it, I thought it was one of the most over-rated films of all time. First of all, it was too long to sit through a story that just did not engage me.

THAT doesn't work!""",10,1 June 2012,"I'm sure that we have all seen the episode of Seinfeld where Elaine(Julia Louis Dreyfuss) can't stand the film The English Patient, and because she hates it, everyone turns on her. I was a little curious for years on just what it was like. Now I have seen it, and while I can't say that I would turn on her, I will say that she was wrong.The film revolves around a burned victim(Ralph Feinnes) who is dying, and as he dies, he reflects on the experience of his life that made him most happy, and just how that happiness vanished. Whilst doing that, more of this man's background information is released to the sweet American nurse(Juliette Binoche in her Oscar winning role) and a stranger(Willem Dafoe) who claims that this man ruined his life.The English Patient is a beautiful film with so many great qualities, even if it does go on for too long. The late Anthony Minghella's film has beautiful cinematography and spectacular attention to detail. The way his characters are unraveled, and the way the love scenes are just marvelous.Feinnes is terrific. You really feel for him, and in the end he may leave you feeling really depressed. Kristin Scott Thomas is also terrific as the one thing in his life that made him happy, and Binoche gives just the right amount of sweetness to deserve her Oscar. Excellent performances.Overall, The English Patient is a powerful film experience. Did it deserve Best Picture? Maybe not. It was against Fargo, and my favorite film of that year, The People Vs. Larry Flynt, was not nominated. But I am not going to say that it deserved to go home empty handed either.A",The English Patient

His name is Anthony Minghella. Yes, they do still make them like they used to, and this is what they look like.  Undeniably beautiful to look at, this eliptical story of a tragic love triangle set amidst the deserts of Africa in WWII, sucked in viewers and critics alike, and swept us away into a wonderful world where romantic epics were literary, smart, and everybody spoke with an accent.  Even if you find the central love story between Fiennes and Thomas and bit too ""British,"" you can't help but be compelled by Binoche's lovesick nurse who becomes determined to get to the heart of the mystery surrounding her dying patient.

I have to admit I stopped midway.I appreciate an intelligent film with something deep to say about life, but not when it's rambling. There are a lot of arty people who will disagree. Maybe it's the sets, or the costuming, or the music that you like. But is that really fair, if the plot's no good? Try Enemy at the Gates instead which is kick-ass.

70,oOoBarracuda,"""I really ought to drag myself outside, but then there'd be the sun.""",10,18 February 2016,"The English Patient is proof that films should be judged on merit and content alone, rather than on how the public perceives them. I feel very much the same about this film as I do about How Green Was My Valley; audiences love to trash that film because it beat out Citizen Kane for Best Picture in 1941. Citizen Kane was an astounding movie; so much about knowledge about filmmaking was expressed through that film that directors still use today. Citizen Kane is often touted as the best movie of all time and constantly listed as prominent actor and director's favorite films, providing a source of inspiration. As good as Citizen Kane is, and I agree that it's phenomenal, so is How Green Was My Valley. I have exactly this same kinship to The English Patient. I have heard many people express disdain for this film for a variety of reasons, namely, though, for beating Fargo for best picture in 1996. I have yet to see Fargo, however, The English Patient starring Ralph Fiennes, Juliette Binoche, Willem Dafoe, and Kristin Scott Thomas was a sensational film directed by Anthony Minghella, and more than deserving of every award it received from the Academy.The English Patient opens in 1944 in war-torn Italy. Hanna (Juliette Binoche) is a nurse working in a mobile medical unit who truly puts her heart in her work, yet, unfortunately, watches many of the patients that she grows attached to succumb to their wounds. Traveling along the treacherous land heavily armed with explosives, Hanna volunteers to stay behind in an abandoned church to care for a dying Englishman, Count Laszlo de Almásy (Ralph Fiennes) badly burned, and partially amnesiac. It is just the two of them until a Canadian member of the Intelligence Service arrives. The Canadian, David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), is certain he knows who the burned patient is and believes he has cooperated with the Germans. David believes the patient's amnesia is a farce, and rather that he is running from his past. After the accusation, the patient begins to open up about his past and reveal his struggles. A beautiful story of love amongst so much hate begins to unfold and the audience is fortunate enough to be along for the ride.There are so many wonderful things about this film, I don't even know where to begin. The cinematography in this film is something to treasure. Beautiful shots of desert landscape make wonderful art for the audience to enjoy. The film is scored so subtly and beautifully you nearly forget there's a score until you hear the music at precisely the right time in the film. The storytelling in this film was also exceptionally well-done. I quite enjoy stories told largely through flashbacks. Witnessing the two parallel lives play out on screen was a great experience and added a lot of depth to the film; especially considering how well-done the director accomplished the feat. The pacing and character development were well-executed, keeping the audience engrossed through the final scene. With so many superb aspects of this film, it is a true disappointment that more people don't give The English Patient a viewing.I reserve the final section of my reviews for audiences I would recommend this film to, but I don't know of anyone that wouldn't gain something from this film. The English Patient was such a remarkable film and doesn't get the credit it deserves so I would love for anyone to watch it at least once. I've plum run out of adjectives to describe how great of an experience this was. I was not expecting to get anything out of this film before I watched it and I am so glad to report that I couldn't have been more wrong.

The reason is because a while back they did an episode of 'Seinfeld' where Elaine is forced to go see this movie with her boss Peterman, and she almost dies of boredom. That being established, you can see how much skepticism I had towards this movie without even watching it. My mother, who had viewed the movie about two years earlier, kept telling me how great it was. So, I decided to suck it up and watch the film. I was kind of glad I did, but at the same time not so glad. 'The English Patient' is a great motion picture, but just like the 'Seinfeld' episode said it had the tendency to put you right to sleep.First of all, the film is 162 minutes (2 hrs., 42 mins.) long. It didn't go by fast, in fact it felt like over three hours. However, as bored as I was with 'The English Patient' at times there was no use denying it was a great film. The cinematography and direction were beautiful, the dialogue was solid, the costume design and makeup were spot-on, and the acting was incredible with four strong performances from Ralph Fiennes, Kristen Scott Thomas, Naveen Andrews and the brilliant Willem Dafoe, and an absolutely extraordinary performance from Ms. Juliette Binoche which rightfully earned her an Academy Award in the 1997 Oscar ceremonies.If you suck it up and decide to see 'The English Patient', I think you'll be able to greatly appreciate it. It moves slow, but the film is filled with such beauty and excellent qualities that in a way it doesn't matter. In other words, 'The English Patient' is a film you watch once and only once just to see how wonderful a motion picture it is.

But it was on t.v. last night and I watched the whole thing all the way through, and wondered why I dismissed such a well-crafted movie. The performances are wonderful, and the way the story weaves in and out from past to present, and from character to character, is amazing. In my case, the riches of this film weren't revealed on a single viewing, but I had to see it again years later. It's kind of like classical music, where you don't like it at first but after hearing it for awhile you appreciate the complexities of it and you start to appreciate your favorite pieces. Juliette Binoche is delightful, she seems so natural and relaxed that it's impossible to imagine that she is aware of a camera in the room filming her. And I think Ralph Fiennes's acting style suits this film perfectly; he's cold and distant through much of the movie, until the heart-wrenching ending when he returns to the cave. Anyone who doesn't cry when Hana is reading Katharine's dying words to the count must have a heart of stone.",The English Patient
74,SKG-2,Excellent film best of 1996,10,29 March 1999,"Once again, it seems I must rise to defend yet another film from the most prevalent syndrome of the 90's; yes, the backlash syndrome.  No sooner does a film that is popular with critics, audiences, or both, than comes a knee-jerk instinct for someone to say, ""If other people like it, or love it, this must stink!""  I'm not denying there were people who honestly didn't like this, but if there's one trend I'd like to see disappear, it's the backlash syndrome.Anyway, I thought this film was terrific.  First, it looked stunning, and director Anthony Minghella gave each story a distinct look, from the browns and whites of the desert, and the past love affair between Almasy and Catherine, to the rainbow like colors of Italy, and the story of Hana taking care of the mysterious ""English Patient.""  As big a fan as I am of dialogue scenes, what I remember from this movie is some of the images, especially the scene with Hana looking at wall murals while going up and down on a rope line.  Second, he takes the story of the novel (which I liked) and makes it more accessible without losing the essentially elliptic tone.  So the two stories - Almasy and Catherine, Hana and Kip(and, essentially, ghosts) - come together without being sentimental.  Lastly, the performances.  Like their stories, Kristin Scott Thomas and Juliette Binoche create two different women, one cool on the outside and passionate on the inside, the other vice versa.  Like one critic pointed out, it's like both are joined together in Almasy's mind, since they're two sides of the same coin.  And Ralph Fiennes continues his string of excellent performances, being caustic and remote while hiding a deep and smoldering love for Catherine, and then turning around and being fatalistic and witty to comfort Hana.  This was my favorite film of 1996, and it stands that way, no matter what the ""backlash"" crowd feels.",The English Patient
75,buiger,Average...,6,30 July 2006,"I beg to disagree with the critics. All things considered, I found this film to be no more than average. Yes, the cinematography is good (allbeit no more than a copy of David Lean's technique and style), the acting is excellent, and the story is good, but...But, the film is badly structured (here I agree with Berardinelli) and way, way too long... In essence, I would say that the first two thirds of the film are rather bad and essentially boring, whereas the ending is excellent, and manages to partially redeem the rest. This however is not nearly enough to justify all the hype that the film has created and all the Oscars it has received.

What it is, is a wandering, poorly paced melodrama about shallow characters.  There are a few breathtaking moments scattered throughout this overblown picture, but not nearly enough to make up for its weaknesses.  I feel bad that Willem Dafoe(usually a very un-hollywood-like actor) took part in this overblown picture.  This film should not have even been nominated for best picture, let alone win it.

77,domino1003,Painfully in Love,10,19 July 2004,"""The English Patient"" is, without a doubt, one of the saddest films that I have ever seen. That's not to say that this is a bad film. It is just that the film deals with painful love. The kind of love that can destroy those around you as well as yourself. Juliette Binoche (Her incredible beauty stole the film, as well as the Oscar), plays Hana, a nurse toward the end of WWII who is in charge of a patient, who is horribly burned in a plane crash. Hana, who is deeply hurting from losing a loved one (friends and lovers seem to die around her, making her feel cursed)sets up shop in a villa and cares for the mysterious patient. The patient, Count Almasy (Ralph Fiennes), is actually holding a lot of secrets, including an affair with Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas), whose husband (Colin Firth) works for the war effort. Almasy's and Katherine's affair starts a spark that slowing begins to destroy everything and everyone around them. It happens so gradually that no one sees it until it's too late.In the course of the movie, lives change. Hana begins a relationship with Kip (Naveen Andrews) while at the villa, while a mysterious man named Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe) is having conversations with the patient...who know exactly who he is and what secrets he is holding.The film is a beauty to behold. The colors, the scenery, the acting, is very beautiful. The film will have you in tears (especially the end), so please have tissues in hand.",The English Patient
78,dead47548,An epic story of love.,10,9 January 2008,"A passionate tale of determination and romance. Like with all of Minghella's work, every single character is so layered and complex. He takes time and devotion to give each character a sufficient amount of intricacy that we truly feel like we know these people and when one of them feels pain, we do as well. When one of them is joyous (the rain scene, for instance) our faces light up with glee.There's Hana, the caring nurse who is too afraid of love to let anyone near her since right from the start the two closest people to her are destroyed by the war. Slowly her friendship with Almasy becomes stronger and stronger and it gives her the courage and determination to pursue a sexual relationship with Kip, who is also a very complex character. On the surface we see him as a kind man, who is very spiritual and loving. But near the end he realizes how isolated he is and the fact that he barely even knew his best friend whom he worked side by side with for years sends him into a complete breakdown. This leads to a very emotional scene, where Binoche really shines. Next up there is David Caravaggio, a spy who eventually gets captured and loses his thumbs while being tortured for information. He sets out on a vengeance to murder everyone connected to his capture, which leads him to Almasy, his final target. But being around Almasy and realizing the pain and suffering that he has been through leads him to look deep inside himself and realize that he doesn't need his revenge. He relieves himself of all this pain and anguish and in the end we see him with a bright grin, just happy to be alive, thumbs or not.Katharine Clifton is a character very similar to those in the past, but she has an extra spark that makes her very unique. As her husband spends less and less attention to her, she becomes involved in a tumultuous love affair with Almasy which leads to some of the most beautifully romantic scenes ever brought to cinema. Minghella easily could have made her another whiny, confused housewife who just passed in and out of the film with no real connection the audience but he bestowed her with a certain grace and dignity which made us want her to have a happy ending and made us adore seeing her and Almasy enjoying each other's company. Even Geoffrey Clifton becomes a layered character when we learn that he isn't venturing off to do photographs, but is instead helping the army explore territory. So while he could have just been another ignorant husband to an adulterous wife, Minghella adds intricacy to him. And of course the entire story all revolves around Almasy, the man who would do anything, even sell out his country to the enemy, just to be with the woman he loved. A truly romantic and beautiful tale.What I found very interesting, though, was how Minghella subtly displays the horrors and terrible effects that war has on the people that aren't even physically fighting it. Through Hana we see a woman who is permanently destroyed and almost unable to love due to the fact that this awful war took away everyone who became close to her. In Kip we see a man who is so blinded by his job and duty to his country that he never even takes the time to appreciate the man he considers his best friend. Caravaggio takes abuse after abuse, with unimaginable pain being inflicted on him as a result of the war. The Cliftons are a loving couple, who have no troubles whatsoever until the war starts and Geoffrey is off helping his country while Katharine becomes involved in an affair. But the most horrific effect of war is shown constantly through Almasy's story. All he wanted was love and companionship, but the war wouldn't allow him that. He only gets his love because of the war, and due to it's changing seriousness his love is ripped away from him and he falls into complete heartache. Then we see him reclaim this love, and he does whatever he can to save her life. But, as Binoche mentions early on the film, when war times come even your name means a great deal. We see this terribly through Almasy who is beaten, dragged away and arrested merely due to his name when all he was trying to do was save the woman he loved. Of course we see the effect of war physically through Almasy in the horrific burning of his entire body. This film shows no huge war scenes and terrible travesties that blow off limbs and open chest cavities, but it manages to send an anti-war message stronger than I've ever seen before. No physical battle is shown, whatsoever, yet it makes me absolutely detest war due to the effect that it has on those who aren't even directly involved.As always for a Minghella work, the performances are absolutely brilliant. Fiennes, Binoche, Thomas and Dafoe deliver some of the best work of the decade. Simply through their eyes we can see all of the pain and emotion searing through them. The right actors were definitely cast in this one. We never hear them shout or break down into a ten minute fit of crying and throwing objects across the room, but we see all of their anguish and torture simply through their eyes and facial expressions. It's a beautifully subtle way of showing emotion and really helped make the film the brilliant masterpiece that it is. I highly doubt that any other cast could have pulled it off so seamlessly.",The English Patient
79,samkan,By No Means A Great Movie,6,10 January 2009,"Seeing this in the theater over ten years ago I remember thinking that I missed an important subplot. My belief was that I'd overlooked something that justified the adultery, the Count's actions, Carragio's pursuit, etc. I believed that knowing what had evaded me would have created dramatic tension as well as making me see the main characters in a better light than I'd witnessed in my ""uninformed"" viewing.Watching the DVD over a decade later, I have exonerated myself. The scenery is breathtaking, the acting first class and the dialog witty. But despite TEP's length, what you see is what you get; i.e., there are no important details or consideration behind the curtain. The Count is, at face, a cold, arrogant and selfish SOB.

82,dr_clarke_2,Anthony Minghella's masterpiece,9,6 June 2020,"The English Patient has variously been described as a war film and a romance; it is perhaps best described however as a tragedy. Adapted by writer and director Anthony Minghella from Michael Ondaatje's novel of the same name, it tells the story a mysterious disfigured man being nursed in an abandoned villa at the tail end of World War Two, and gradually unpicks his past and how he came to be injured.
The English Patient is a stately, elegant film, with a carefully written, elegant script. The characterisation is convincing, from the scarred and dying protagonist Almásy who recounts the doomed love affair that culminated in his in injuries, through his nurse Hana, to bomb disposal expert Kip and pretty much everyone else in the movie. The plot unfolds via a non-linear narrative that alternates between scenes set in the story's present and flashbacks as Hana and visiting Canadian Caravaggio gradually learn the truth about Almásy. The story's tragedy lies in the ill-fated love affair between charismatic but aloof explorer and archaeologist Almásy and the married Katharine Clifton, both characters the picture of upper class restraint in the face of growing mutual attraction. Their happiness proves all too brief, as Katherine's husband's pain and jealousy result in her death, and the same series of events eventually lead to Almásy
Interwoven with the story of Almásy and Katherine are other subplots, as we discover what happened to Caravaggio's absent thumbs, and as Hana falls in love with Kip. If there's a problem with The English Patient is that although all of the characters and their stories are compellingly written, the film is quite slow at times and the additional plot threads feel like padding. Nevertheless, the film is largely successful and the horrors of war provide a striking and often horribly well realised backdrop, with some truly unpleasant scenes such as Caravaggio having his thumbs cut off by sadistic Nazi torturers. The scene of Kip disarming the bomb in the pit is incredibly tense: just when it seems it will explode, he successfully renders it harmless, but the scene is juxtaposed with the subsequent death of Sergeant Hardy which is realistically out of the blue and meaningless.
Minghella's direction results in a handsome film, in no small part to the gorgeous location filming, which John Seale's cinematography exploits to full effect. Scenes such as the sandstorm and the German invasion are impressively staged, whilst the make-up used for the hideously wounded Almásy has aged well. The casting is perfect: Ralph Fiennes completely immerses himself in the role of Almásy, and Kristin Scott Thomas, Willem Dafoe, Juliette Binoche and Naveen Andrews are just as well cast, with strong support provided from the likes of Colin Firth and Kevin Whately. All of the actors give naturalistic performances, which make the tragic pattern of their lives all the more potent (notably, every character of note loses somebody dear to them, even those characters who get an otherwise happy ending). The ending, which sees Almásy convince Hana to commit euthanasia, is poignant rather than mawkish and that's partly due to the acting as well to Minghella's screenplay.
Walter Murch's careful editing is crucial to the success of the film's complex plot, and it is the fact that it reveals the answers to the questions posed by the screenplay a bit at a time that helps to drive the narrative and maintain the audience's interest. The English Patient could perhaps have been a little leaner and a little shorter, but as it stands its still a very impressive piece of work and arguably the highpoint of the late Minghella's well-respected career.",The English Patient
83,mnpollio,Odious tedium,2,6 December 2008,"More than a decade after enduring this atrocity, I am still at a loss to determine what exactly compelled viewers (not to mention the Academy Awards) to lavish this uninspiring vapid mess with such over-the-top praise. There are so many things inherently wrong with the film that it becomes difficult to isolate which one of them is the most responsible for the film's implosion. Based on a popular novel - the reading of which would probably take less time than enduring the film - The English Patient centers on an mysterious count hideously disfigured by burns who victimizes his nurse (and the viewer) with the tale of ill-fated romance that left him physically and emotionally scarred. The film has its moments of beauty, but sweeping desert scenes are a dime a dozen in cinema and hardly earn this film's heralded descriptions of ""sweeping"" ""majestic"" and ""grand"". The film's two biggest problems are its length and its leads. The core story is relatively simple, but is so loaded up with pointless subplots and completely unnecessary extraneous characters that the film literally screeches to a halt shortly out of the starting gate. Willem Dafoe shows up late in the film to overact shamelessly and provide a narrative function that could just as easily have been satisfied by the nurse in a fraction of the time. Meanwhile, Colin Firth, whose character sets the film into motion as part of the central love triangle, is barely given a nod worth of screen time. Director Anthony Minghella seems to have no knowledge of the basics of pace, character development or how to emotionally involve his audience. A truly compelling romance requires that the central pairing crackle and draw the viewer into their emotions, whether the romance is illicit, young love or mature. Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott-Thomas are both singularly fine actors, but both share a similar acting style in that they are often restrained and emotionally aloof. The writing and dialog between them leaves the viewer unable to tell whether their characters are in love or merely in lust - but either way the actors generate zero chemistry between each other. Both come across as cold, selfish, uninteresting and emotionally inaccessible - leaving a glacial dead zone smack in the center of the film. To somewhat alleviate that, we get a romantic subplot between the nurse and a Sikh bomb expert that has a bit more emotion, but placing the emotional burden of the film on two supporting characters is highly unfair and completely ineffective. Juliette Binoche, as the nurse, acts pretty much like your standard super-model, leaving what little sympathy is generated to come from Naveen Andrews appealing work. By the time the film inexcusably limps towards its unforgivable third hour, most viewers will actually be rooting for the English Patient to do away with himself and regret that he had not done it a good 90 minutes earlier. Simply dreadful pretentious piffle.",The English Patient
84,shanfloyd,A thought-provoking story... rich in performances.,9,6 September 2005,"The director Anthony Minghella must have had some immense passion for the original story, otherwise I believe he could not let this film grow such slowly emphasizing on every relevant detail. To wrap up the premise, it is definitely a love story, but it is much much more. The film features two stories of love... one is Count Almasy's passionate affair with his colleague's wife Katharine, shown in flashback; and the other, set in the story's present, is between Kip the Sikh bomb disposal expert and Hana the French-Canadian nurse who took care of Almasy after a deadly injury in WWII. While the central story revolves around Almasy's painful memories, it also contrasts his and Hana's experiences with love with a haunting style.The character of Almasy gives a golden chance to any actor. His plane got shot down in the Sahara and he was taken to Italy severely burnt, injured, and crippled, with an acute memory loss. He was put to an abandoned house with Hana to take care of him. As Hana read some part from the book he possessed, his memories kept coming back to him... memories of a passionate yet futile relationship. And yet he was surely going to die, his only motivation to live was to get the memory of the that love's fate back. Ralph Fiennes gives perhaps his career-best performance as Almasy. He portrays Almasy as a glum yet romantic man who himself never thought his capability to love someone could be so deep. His take on the burnt-faced, crippled Almasy is equally fascinating. He certainly deserved his Academy nomination.Hana is an extremely good natured woman, yet her own experiences with love had been also painful until she meets the Army bomb expert Kip Singh (played excellently by Naveen Andrews). She gets fascinated by his original romanticism and subsequently worries if he will also face the same fate as her previous lovers. Her relationship to Almasy is nothing extraordinary as such, but there remained a bond between them, formed by their choices and nature of love. Juliette Binoché won Oscar for this role and that sums up how she acted. She portrays Hana as one who's optimistic in the outside but bears a strange frustration and pain about love deep inside. Two contrasting scenes: one, when she plays at the yard in the evening and two, when she rides the bicycle up to the bridge to see if Kip's alright.All the other actors were also great. Willem Dafoe gives a very realistic performance as the Canadian war victim with a hidden agenda. Kristin Scott Thomas perhaps, in my opinion, was not the best choice for the role of Katharine but what she did was magical. Colin Firth was also nice to watch as her husband.As a director Minghella is definitely breathtaking. Instead of discussing his style, I would only mention some scenes from the movie which remained unforgettable. One, the sandstorm; two, the scene where Almasy first courts Katharine; three, the first verbal exchange between Almasy and Caravaggio; four, where Kip shows Hana the paintings at the church... I see I can go on and on. Minghella also brings out a magnificent screenplay with some memorable quotes.The English Patient is a movie rich with every ingredient a serious film should have -- cinematography, original music, make-up, good script and of course, acting. Although it may seem a bit slow it is not boring, rather this slowness is one of its gifts.",The English Patient

However in fact such extremely calm, actually is a kind of vacant.Do those who have experienced a lot of people, will feel more and more vacant life? People who set clear goals for themselves, are those goals really what they want?

It is a mediocre movie, lavished by critics and audience alike because of the ""love story."" Not all love stories are good, which is unarguable, yet the only reason people say they love this movie is because it was a ""beautiful love story."" Beautiful it was not. The characters were cold, calculated, and the love story in it is  an affair between two amoral people. The woman is cheating on her husband, and her lover is a German allied spy during WWII. But that's not all. He turns an entire town over to Nazis. When people ask ""what's to hate about this movie,"" the film really speaks for itself. Either that, or the people who rave about this movie are just liking it based on the good reviews. This is a Hollywood movie, covered in a false glaze that gives it the apperance of an ""art house"" film. If you're going to like this movie, at least give a good reason. In my opinion this movie was boring, scornful, with only two saving graces, which is Juliette Binoche and Naveen Andrews' very touching performances.

88,MovieAlien,Kudos to all who gave this movie a negative review...,1,25 February 1999,"And my pity to all those out there who can't help but rave about this. It's quite clear that this film is either one you love or hate, but one point to make is that it does not depend on the person who watches it. Be it a child, an American, or someone from Europe, there's no such determination, which is as prejudiced as the people who commented earlier, as to ""why someone would or would not like it."" It really disgusts me when someone says you don't like a movie because you're ""American"" or that you ""did not understand it."" I understood this burnt piece of money dung of a movie really well; The thing I don't understand is why it is loved by so many people...It seems whenever I ask someone why they liked this, I never get a reasonable answer. Just because this was a filmization from a (Michael Ondjante) romance novel does not neccesarily make it a good movie. A novel and a movie are two different things. I, personally, am not a fan of the ""lovers-broken-apart"" genre, but that is not why I loathed the tripe. I loathed this film simply because it was an overlong, over hyped, unsympathetic piece of grunge with no admiral protagonist. If it was based on a novel by Tom Wolfe, Clive Barker, or Anne Rice it would still make no difference to me whatsoever.There was NO point to this crap. What was beautiful about it? The fact they filmed scenes of deserts? The fact it was about an amoral man who has an affair with his best friend's wife, get's burned up in a place crash and rambles to a nurse about what happened?  What most don't understand is just because a movie is about love and romance, does not make it good. Would you find this film beautiful if it was about two race sumpremacy people having an affair? There's a question you might want to answer. The whole idea of that plot nuance makes me grimace and puke.There was no chemistry whatsoever, Ralph Fiennes looked about as wooden, stiff and emotionless as a horse in a pose of rigor mortis, Thomas looked as if she had consumed prozac when she was premenstrual. They were not beautiful, Fiennes was portrayed as an evil spy who sells out to the Nazis, and Thomas played a cold flaky woman committing adultery.I was jealous of the people who sat next to me in the theater and got their money refunded just because they had known someone who worked in the theater. In that sense, yes. Otherwise, no. Well done, no.The only other noticeable credit of the director (Anthony Minghella) was Truly Madly Deeply. I was scratching my head as to how and why such a big time magnate like Saul Zaentz would work with such a no-name. Unfortunately, I don't know why it is and how that happened. If I knew, I would be very rich.When Zaentz entered the stage gloating at what the ignorance of the Academy did for him, I imagined that he would go home that night, snicker, and think how some people's stupidity could mean another person's benefit. If you did so many great films in the past, you're bound to be smart and feature a new project to the public without any complaints, right?This movie has the relevance and value of a  watery bowel movement after it just came out of the toaster oven. It would have made no difference if the film was actually about that.If you haven't already seen it, avoid this movie at all costs. You'll be doing yourself a very big favor.",The English Patient

Isn't that funny?If this movie is aimed to the so-called ""Intellectual Crowd,"" then why hasn't that bunch summed up an ""Intellectual Reason"" as to why they liked it? I've noticed a lot of comments in the Northen European hemisphere giving this a good review, I can't decide whether it's actually that or if I'm surrounded by a bunch of comments by the same person liking The English Patient.I was not expecting car chases, explosions, or action at all. I was just expecting a decent story about how innocence is stolen by warfare and evil, and how two people are separated from such. I interpreted the opposite. The film was about two bad people, and how one big bad thing keeps them away from something they want. In film, you could cheer for the villains  when they're the protagonist, but when they're not interesting, it's quite difficult. On top of that, it was just an all around boring movie. This was the case for the English Patient. The only thing it proved was that Ralph Fiennes tops as  being a #1 self-centered pretty boy.If you ever get recommendations to see this, and have not already seen it, my kind favor is that you ask the ""suggestor"" why it may be good.

The love story here is between two selfish immoral twits, one being married and the other being, well......just kind of a jerk. If there was ever a case of two people getting exactly what they deserved this is it. A far more intersting plot would have been the relationship between the nurse, played very well by Juliet B., and the Indian bomb/mine squad guy. He probably was the best actor in the entire movie, although Colin Firth was stellar as alway. Defoe was adequate, nothing more. I've never seen him play a role with any sort of depth so didn't expect it here anyway. But back to the main lovers Ralph F. (bland as usual) and KST (lovely and talented). The story is good and how they came to meet believable, but how it unfolds and plays out turns silly quickly. It's just not credible how they apparently fall so deeply in love. The love scenes show no passion whatsoever. It's like two carp kissing each other. As with any big budget Hollywood movie there's several scenes you just need to shrug off because they're so dense. Like when dude falls off the top of the truck. Okay, that happens. But why would two trucks drive right off the road after. That makes about as much sense an eating a bowl of sand for dinner, but the scene that followed was riveting. Inconsistencies rule the day here. So fast forward to the so called tragic end. He supposedly loves her, and walks through the desert to get help to save her, but the way he acts when he arrives in town virtually guarantees her death. What an idiot! All he had to do was answer some simple questions but he flies off his nut and starts demanding a truck. Ridiculous, so yeah she's left there longer than she needed to be and of course what you would expect to happen to her does. Derp. Way to go Ralphie Boy. No, they were selfish people who gambled with their lives and hurt everyone who they were purported to care for. The lowest elements in society is what they were. I was glad at the end. Oh, and why would they leave so much morphine with them at that place when his fate was certain and the war was still going on ? Yet another absurdity. The acting was hit and miss but seldom wooden. But it's hard to wrap up your interest in two self absorbed liars who don't give a rip about anything except fulfilling their own short term lustful desires.",The English Patient

Antony Minghella's faithful adaptation of Michael Ondaatje's novel about a badly burned pilot, only identified as 'The English Patient', who is found and taken care of by Academy Award Winner Juliette Binoche in an old monastery in rural Italy during the close of World War II, while he has flashbacks of a passionate affair.7.3/10""A memorable and beautiful film""A very slow burning film",The English Patient
93,Aly200,"Exquisite Cinematography, Well Acted, but Overly Sentimental and Unnecessarily Long",6,2 February 2017,"Winner of 9 Oscars and in my honest opinion one of the most overrated films in cinematic history. This should not take away from the fact that the film does beautiful locations with some stellar acting by its all star cast all under the keen directorial eye of Anthony Minghella.Told mostly through flashbacks, the film based on the bestselling novel tells the tragic tale of a mysterious Hungarian Count and his love affair with a married Englishwoman in World War II Africa. The ""patient"" of the title is the Count telling his tale to the French Canadian nurse who is caring for him after a terrible accident that horrifically burned him, and also a Canadian Army Officer who is investigating the Count as part of an Intelligence operation. The film boasts an all star cast giving some career-best performances. Playng the title ""English Patient"" (in his 2nd Oscar nominated role) is the wonderfully talented Ralph Fiennes as Count Almasy, a man supposedly of Hungarian nobility but whose past is so mysterious that we never learn who Almasy really is or where he came from. Fiennes is charming, brooding at times and eloquent in the role and makes the mystery surrounding his character even more compelling despite the unanswered questions about his past. Fiennes does display a formidable chemistry with costar Kristin Scott- Thomas who plays the married woman who is the object of his affections along with some minutely interesting (yet sadly wasted for all the flashbacks) scenes with fellow actors Juliette Binoche who plays his nurse and Willem Dafoe as the officer who is looking into Almasy's background. Juliette Binoche won the film's only acting Oscar for her work as French- Canadian nurse Hanna who cares for the injured Count. The actress is subtle, soft-spoken and articulate mixed with naivety towards the dangers of the world she is living after a brutal international conflict. Hanna is still intelligent as she cares for those around her such as her patient, Officer David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe) who is looking into her patient's past but trusts him to protect them from harm, and particularly in her relationship with Kip, a British-Indian officer stationed near the villa where Hanna and her patient are sequestered. We don't learn about Hanna's background prior to the war and its aftermath, but what we see from Binoche's portrayal Hanna is the center of the present-day narrative as she connects with those around her.Rounding out the other two key roles are Willem Dafoe as David Caravvagio, the officer seeking out Almasy, and Kristin Scott-Thomas as Katharine Cifton, the woman whom Almasy loved. As Caravvagio, Dafoe is a smaller character than than those of Ralph Fiennes, Juliette Binoche and Kristin Scott-Thomas (despite receiving third billing), but the character has a connection that does matter to the narrative. Fiennes's Almasy was reputed to be a spy for the Axis Powers (which we and David never learn the actual truth) and his actions lead to a horrific consequence for Caravvagio; Caravaggio is tortured and loses some digits in one of the most harrowing scenes of the film (just hearing actor Willem Dafoe's screams and barely seeing the torture unfold made me have to cover my eyes and almost scream out myself). The tension is palpable between Caravvagio and Almasy in the present as Dafoe portrays a quiet desire for revenge for the wrong inflicted on him, but also a developing sympathy for the injured shell of a man before him in addition to the protective and caring nature that David displays towards young Hanna (it is clear that he probably harbored romantic feelings for Hanna) as she hides in the villa with her patient. Actress Kristin Scott-Thomas embodies the typical proper Englishwoman as Katharine Clifton; obedient, soft-spoken, well dressed and kemped but an intelligent woman. Katharine begins the film as a loyal wife to her husband (Colin Firth) who it seems would never be an adulteress, but when she begins to spend more time with Count Almasy, Katharine starts to question where her heart truly lies. She attempts to live both ways, but must make a choice when she fears that her husband will discover her affair with Almasy. The ultimate decision she makes ends up with a steep price for both her and her lover by the film's end.The locations are stunning throughout the film as the narrative juxtaposes from war-torn Africa to the ravaged countryside of Italy in the present. The sets are confined for the Italian locales as we are isolated with the small ragtag group of Hanna, Count Almasy, David Caravaggio and Kip with his fellow officers who patrol the perimeter to protect the other three. Contrasting the isolation is the vast scope of the African deserts and crowded villages where we see many peoples from soldiers, townsfolk, some of the central and minor characters but also so much empty space once we are traveling the desert near the end of the flashback narrative. The vastness again evokes an isolating feeling.The film's run-time is egregiously long and plodding which is the most irritating factor of the film other than the schmaltzy romance. Sitting through nearly three hours of a love story is excruciating even with the great cinematography and good acting. This boredom might evoke memories of a classic sitcom episode where a TV character openly expressed her dismay at sitting through multiple viewings of this film. I can relate because I get so bored that I have to keep myself busy to keep from falling asleep.A stunning masterpiece of filmmaking despite its minor flaws.",The English Patient

95,ldavis-2,A great love story?,2,13 February 2003,"Sorry. Katharine and Almásy are two very self-absorbed people, their encounters are anything but romantic, and there is no compelling reason for them to seek each other out: Almásy is a surly jerk, and Clifton worships the ground Katharine walks on. She initially breaks with Almásy not because she loves her husband (notice how quickly she recovers after realizing she is a widow), but fears what will happen to her social standing.As if being asked to root for these twits wasn't bad enough:1) How did Almásy know that Katharine told Clifton she wanted to return to England?2) Trying to get Madox to turn around, Almásy shoots the flare behind him. Despite Almásy's assurances to Katharine, it's a mystery how Madox manages to find them.3) Caravaggio asks Almásy if he killed the Cliftons. But since he was told of the circumstances of Madox's death, he must have been briefed on them, too.4) Assuming they found Clifton's plane, how did British Intelligence locate his body after Almásy buried it?5) How could the Nomads find the thimble, but not Katharine?6) Katharine and Almásy had hooked up by December 1938. Germany invaded Egypt in February 1941, but was driven out by November 1943. Almásy gives the Nazis the maps so he can get back to Katharine, gets shot down, then pops up in Italy in 1945?! Forget that we're supposed to buy that nobody suspected they were doing the nasty for over two years! Either Katharine was in the cave for two years (not likely), Almásy was cared for by the Nomads for two more years (even less likely), or Minghella screwed up the time line big time (a lot more likely.)But what really drove me nuts was: 7) The British couldn't possibly have mistaken ""Almásy"" as German because Hungarian and German do not have a common ancestor. Ironically, English is a Germanic language.I read that when Saul Zaentz bought the rights, he ""assured"" Michael Ondaatje: ""Don't worry, we'll f***-up your book.""

97,Hancock_the_Superb,Homage to old-school epic film making a la David Lean,8,24 December 2006,"In World War II, a badly burned amnesiac known only as ""The English Patient"" is found in the African desert and is transported to Italy, where he joins a convoy of medical troops and others at an abandoned monastery. Among them are Hana (Juliette Binoche), a Canadian nurse whose lovers generally meet unpleasant ends; Kip (Naveen Andrews) and Hardy (Kevin Whately), two explosives experts who search the monastery for bombs; and David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), a Canadian soldier-of-fortune who knows the identity of the English patient and has a score to settle.Through flashbacks we learn the story of the Patient: he is Laszo Almasy (Ralph Fiennes), a Hungarian explorer who, in the late '30s, falls in with a group of British cartographers, including Geoffrey Clifton (Colin Firth) and his wife Katharine (Kristen Scott-Thomas), while mapping the deserts of North Africa. After Clifton leaves them on government business, Katharine and Clifton fall in love with each other in the desert, resulting in an affair that, naturally, has a less-than-happy ending.If one is able to overlook the illogical parts of the story line (such as, why would a patient found in Africa be sent to what is essentially the front line of the war in Italy?), then you can appreciate ""The English Patient"" as a throwback to the intelligent, layered, sweeping epics of David Lean in the '60s. Much more than ""Titanic"" or other epic romances of late, this movie puts one in mind of ""Doctor Zhivago"" and ""Gone With the Wind"" - an epic love story set against a huge historical backdrop. You shouldn't expect a war film, though there are some striking (if all-too-brief) scenes of violence that stand out more than the romantic sections, as is usually the case (Caravaggio's interrogation by a sadistic SS officer (Jurgen Prochnow) in particular).The movie is very ambiguous, in regards to pretty much everything. The central question of the film is: How far are you willing to go for love? As critics of the movie are fast to point out, Almasy is, on the surface, a far-from-likable character - he has an affair with a married woman and betrays his country by giving maps and intelligence to the Germans, causing the death of his friend Madox (Julian Wadham) and the torture of Caravaggio, and actually killing a British soldier who has him under arrest at one point. The fact that Almasy is in many ways reprehensible is kind of the point - he's in love with Katharine, and sees the world narrowly in terms of his love that loyalty to country (or anything else for that matter) is secondary; as Almasy says, he hates ""Ownership. Being owned."" The two engage in a rather bold love affair (shagging within ear shot of hundreds of people at a Christmas party) and it's clear that Katharine is more drawn to the mysterious, exciting Almasy than the comparatively boring Geoffrey.The 1944 subplot is somewhat shaky and seems superfluous; the romance between Kip and Hannah is never completely believable, and I feel the film could have done without it. But those sequences do add an interesting texture of mystery and complexity to the film, so I won't complain too much.Like the epics mentioned above, the film is able to convey time and place through simple devices like crowd scenes, strategically placed posters, and military presence. We do not need to dwell on the fact that it's 1938 in Cairo, but it's helpful to know. The direction of Anthony Minghella and the desert cinematography by John Seale are absolutely gorgeous; the sand dunes, sand storms, and haunting caves of the desert are captured in beautiful detail. Gabriel Yared's score is haunting and atmospheric.The acting is generally solid. Fiennes gives a very layered performance as a character who is mysterious, complex, and haunted. The difference between the Almasys of 1938 and 1944 are remarkable; one exciting and somewhat carefree, the other haunted and reflective. Kirsten Scott Thomas is effective as Katharine, the female explorer looking for adventure, and Colin Firth gives one of his best performances as Geoffrey, who realizes early on that he's no competition for the exciting Almasy. Willem Dafoe does nice work as Caravaggio, the shifty, hunted thief-turned-spy driven by revenge. Jurgen Prochnow gives a performance reminiscent of Jose Ferrer in ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (and a similar character too): very brief, but more memorable then some of the major characters. Some of the 1944 actors are unremarkable: Juliette Binochette is nothing special, while Naveen Andrews is good but unremarkable. Kevin Whately, as Kip's ill-fated partner, does what he can with a rather smallish role.""The English Patient"" is not a perfect movie by any means, but the vituperative attacks on it by much of the movie-going public are not deserved at all. Maybe it's a show of how film sensibilities have changed since the era of the Leans and Kubricks, or maybe people were expecting something simple to understand. Complex to fault, brilliantly directed and shot, ""The English Patient"" is a wonderful modern-day epic.8/10",The English Patient
98,manendra-lodhi,Very slow but still charming,8,3 September 2012,"The film is the greatest example of how editing is able to convey the whole story. I had heard a lot about its editing and I must say that I was completely blown away after half an hour or so. The story is very slow but based on performances it manages to somehow keep your interest level high. It is a love story but not in a normal sense. All the love parts are shown in flashbacks and what we see actually is the aftermath.PROS: The beauty of the film no doubt lies in its editing pattern, but there were too many characters and all were properly analyzed. It never looked like they were focusing too much on the lead cast. Parallel to the main story we have a nurse who is struggling in different incidents in the present time and for the refreshing feelings we have the flashbacks in which I say Ralph fiennes is looking too cool. The film is a mix of a couple of stories with the main story holding all of them tightly. In all the film was not at all a waste of time.CONS: Only thing that can come into mind after watching it is about the length. But I would like to say that it is one of the best slow movies made.Message: ""You cannot control everything."" Verdict: ""Go for it""",The English Patient
99,buzznzipp1995,"""Enthralling""...",10,8 January 2007,"I won't go to a generalization, and say it's the best love story of all time, as some have said. That's fine, people feel very deeply about this film, you either love it I believe...or you simply hate it. I don't want to say, the best of all,because that is simply too 'broad' for me to make a statement like that. However, I feel very passionately about The English Patient, as well as millions of other people do. The awards say it all. I don't agree with critics, on many levels, however, the ones that picked this one, I couldn't agree more.9-Oscars. 41-wins.37-other nominations, makes this love story,on the top of the bunch. From the director, Anthony Minghella, the story that bursts onto the screen and as Mr. Peterman (from T.V.s Seinfeld) said, ""Elaine, I simply can't take my eyes off of it!"" In this instance, I don't agree with Elaine's response. But the story builds and takes the right time, needed to make it's case beautifully. The cinematography,(John Seale) won multiple awards as well, as it ought too. I have not really paid much attention to Juliette Binoche, until now. Well, not entirely true I loved her performance in ""Sabrina"" Lovely story of a somewhat complicated relationship, next to Harrison Ford. But this was simply an incredibly differing character for her, and as deeply talented as she is, she simply shined in her own subtle and graceful way, she was just what this film was looking for, I'm truly glad that it was her performance and not another actress. Ralph Fiennes, was also spectacular in portraying Count Laszlo De Almasy. I had a new respect for his ability, after seeing this one! What can you say except, see this picture again.

101,TheOny13,"Shakespeare In Love, the Prequel",5,30 January 2021,"I've always hated that movie. I always thought it was a pretentious piece of cinematic garbage that tried in vain to reach philosophical and intellectual hights but which lacked both the writing quality and the characters for that sort of stuff. So when I saw that Joseph's brother played in this film I had a somewhat of a concern about this movie and weather or not I should watch it. But given the raging reviews here I decided to give it a try, and two hours and 40 minutes later the only thought I had was ""I really need a better place to bury those bodies!"".... ops sorry... I mean... ""why did I waste 2 hours and 40 minutes of my life with this garbage?"" Stay with me as I give my opinion on this movie. I won't be going into any spoiler teritory breaking down every single majot plot event in this movie, mainly because I can't remember half of it, but I'll be mentioning some plot events shortly in order to pin point the flaws I found in this movie.So the movie is basically about a english guy named Almasy who is taken care of by a nurse while living his last moments on this earth. The movie begins with with the middle of this story in which we see how he came to be in the state he is at the moment he is found and taken care of. That was a good thing, I liked that. I like it when movies even if they have a simple plot make it more interesting by fratcturing it's narative and making the viewer pay attention and then at the end ending the cycle and giving the full picture about the events that happened. Then the movie moves pretty realistic with twists and turn that sometimes left me baffled while watching it. However those are the only good elements in this movie, because for the rest of it this movie is pretentious, pseudo-intellectual, self-absorbed, quasi-philosophical and generally boring. The biggest bone of contentment has to be the story which is so underdeveloped and so superficial that is hard at times to realize everyone's motivations or what's happening or why something is happening, which in turn makes you as a viewer generally speaking dettached from everything that is happening and not caring about any of the characters or what they try to accomplish. Both of the leads are very bland and one-dimensional with the only dimension being their physical atraction to each other. It felt at times like a softer adult movie. There weren't any feelings these characters gave to us or to each other so basically I was left stone cold hearted when something happened to them. Then there are the present day characters which felt like a thin shallow of a person and were there only to accopany Almasy on his last moments. In some characters' cases I was wondering what are they doing there to begin with?? Then there's the story that is pretty simple but told in a interesting way generaly speaking, because particulary speaking at times felt like the writeres had no idea about time or about human nature as well as character motivations. The story begins chronological in 1939 with Almasy in the desert searching for something, what? Don't know! The movie never made that clear with a single line of dialogue. Then as the action progresess it is plain clear that no more than months or 1-2 years have passed until he has the accident in which he burns but then somehow that is shown to happen in 1945 when Germany surrendered. When did the time pass that fast? Don't know! Then there's the morality of the story. We are basically forced to like two people that have a romance (if you could call that a romance) even though the woman is married and there's no hint of remorse on any of them since her husband is a good friend to Almasy. I found myself constantly wanting for both of them to die because they had no real connection or morality in their relationship other than the connection they had in their need for sleeping with each other. The music. Altough there are some good tracks the soundtrack felt overall very bland and simplistic and it felt in my opinion no way oscar worthy. From a technical point of view the movie is well shot and well directed although not oscar worthy again. This is Lawrence of Arabia level, and that movie came out 34 years before this one.I could go on and make fun of every single thing this movie gets awfully wrong but I'm too tired for that. I'll simply give this movie a higher rating than Shakespeare in Love because this movie was more pleasant to watch from a story and technical aspect. Aside from that this movie has bland characters, simplistic story that is told in an interesting style at times, mediocre music and weak performances from most of the cast. It seems the Fiennes bothers played only in this sort of movies before the 2000s. It's such a shame because this movie began fantastic and with more imagination, more feel to it and more attention to characters this movie could have easily been a masterpiece of storytelling and emotional impact. Instead what it was, was a souless, cold, if at times realistical enough drama with no morality that never left any impact in me after watching it, and by the end I pretty much forgoten half of it. Then again there might be another reason for that... I slept through most of the movie. 5/10 from me. Weak!",The English Patient

106,max von meyerling,How did this junk win ten Oscars?,4,23 October 2014,"Then there was THE English PATIENT. There had been a lot of partisan conflict pro and con over THE English PATIENT. It won no less than ten Oscars including Best Picture. Yet there were some who complained bitterly. There was an episode of Seinfeld where Elaine grows exasperated at her friends and colleagues mooning over the film to the point where her boss insists on taking her to see the film and while he sits there teary eyed she squirms in her seat and just shouts out ""Die already!""Everyone is aghast at Elaine's reaction as they sit teary eyed, overwhelmed by the romance. But what is the romance? It's nothing more than our old friend infidelity, except here it's clothed in the veddy veddy colonial carryings on in Cairo and the western desert in the period before WW2. Falling in love by campfire light while reading Herodotus. Oh please. It reminds me of love scenes in movies where we're assured that it all takes place on 800 thread count sheets. It's making love. I always seem to hear the gravelly voice of Henry Miller saying, ""Don't you mean f**king?""Of course the story is told in flashbacks. Now usually flashbacks are a narrative devise used to reveal the plot non-sequentially. But here the use of flashbacks is merely to draw out this basic story of infidelity and revenge for more than two hours. It's like one of those $500 hamburgers. It's got wagyu beef and truffles but it's still a hamburger.If it were taking place in a Bronx tenement it would all be over in half an hour. It would be just another double murder/suicide. But with everybody downing gin and tonics at the club and a bit of the old scholars shuffle in colonial offices, it presents a certain retro romanticism (at least as far as furnishings and accessories go) which is beyond the experience of the audience but which they want to believe existed. I've been to these places and people are so bored that adultery is the rule rather than the exception. There's nothing else to do but to screw each other's wives and when that grows tiresome to have a bash at the local brothels. A steady flow of tourists is a bit too much to be hoped for.Tits and ass with class Lenny Bruce would call it. This drawing things out reminds me of reality TV or the quiz programs which tease before they say the answer is right and we'll get to see something we're promised after some adverts. This is why Elaine became so frustrated.Of course the action, while filled with incident, is patently absurd. First of all, it doesn't pass my Lady Bracknell test. One suicide by bi-plane can only be regarded as a misfortune. But two suicides by bi-plane suggests carelessness. Just a little gold flake on our burger.Then there's the part where our hero walks three days through the desert to bring back some help for his love that he leaves battered and bleeding in a cave. He finally makes it to the British outpost. Somehow in between the first bi-plane suicide and our hero's arrival WW2 has broken out and instead of raising the alarm and getting help for his lady love, he is interned. The interment is done by a sergeant major. Now they may be the backbone of the British Army but they do not have the authority to arrest and intern people willy-nilly. If someone walked into town from the desert and there was anything suspicious about him, he would have to be debriefed by Intelligence, which would have meant he would have been interrogated by an officer. Once he met an officer they would have matched up friends in Cairo and help would be on the way.The fact that he had a foreign name would have meant little because obviously he was a gentleman. There was a similar incident in WW I where a British spy was found in the Sinai with the name Meinertzhagen and he turned out to be a British Officer (see the incident in The Lighthorsemen). So, no British Sergeant Major was likely to assume the authority of an officer in interning a foreign gentleman whatever his name or nationality was.But OK, lets move on.When our hero is interred and escapes it's the first days of the war. The Afrika Korps arrived in early 1941. What had he been doing until then? He delivers his maps to them in exchange for a bi-plane that had previously been squirreled away. Hadn't he returned to the cave in the year and a half of freedom? So he too smashes into the desert with horrible burns. He is rescued and brought to a British medical unit.Now this gets me. Instead of sending him on to an equipped hospital in Tobruk or Alexandria or Cairo even, they schlepp him through the loss of Tobruk, the victory at El Alamein, the landings in Sicily, the fight up the Italian boot to wind up in Florence (champagne for the burger?). He's a burn patient after all and they hold on to them moving him around from battle to battle for four years. Not sending him to a hospital. Seems a bit incredible. Seems insane.Thus the other reason for the flashback structure–time makes no sense here. On the Wikipedia page for the novel it's categorized as ""meta fiction"". I know Borges was able to freeze a bullet in time to give a philosopher about to be executed time to finish his work. But that was exactly what the story was ""about"". Here time means nothing.

Indeed, ""the heart is an organ of fire,"" and these are its ashes. By interweaving the love story with history from Herodotus to the atrocities of WW II, it provides a mythic, legendary backdrop to a tale of lovers, whose intense passion, like that of Romeo and Juliet or Orpheus and Eurydice, leads them to disregard the world around them. From the moment that they dive into the Cave of Swimmers, we are reminded of the fate which is common to us all. The movie was perfectly cast and the performances are first rate.

(i dont much trust the academy when it handles out loads of oscars, the debacles of titanic & gladiator spring to mind). i expected a pompous over-blown epic with little feel. how wrong, how wrong i was!!the english patient is one of the most beautiful movies ive seen in a long time. the story unravels beautifully in layers, admittedly it is a bit slow, but the director has built up the atmosphere wonderfully. each and every character is well etched and totally totally believable. what a pleasant surprise in todays plastic hollywood!!the acting is simply terrific, if i had to pick one person for an oscar from the movie, i would have chosen kirsten scott thomas, who ofcourse did not win it - frances mcdromand did for fargo - touch and go ... i would have gone with kirsten.having said that, theres nothing to be taken away from any of the magnificient actors here - ralph fiennes, juliette binoche & naveen andrews & willem dafoe are all terrific. theres enough about the story in the other reviews, so i wont go into it.the movie is truly magnificent, splendorous and worthy of the many oscars it won, especialy considering its competition. a grand romantic epic, in the lines of casablanca - a memorable movie whose only fault is its lengtha splendid 9!!",The English Patient

111,Snowgo,An Exercise in Pointlessness,1,28 May 2014,"I figured that with a title as pedestrian as The English Patient, it has to be good, right? First off, I thought I was in WWI, not WWII, because they were using bi-planes. The first plane is a Stearman, an American aircraft used only state-side in WWII, for training purposes. The proper plane to use, for two people, is the British Boulton-Paul Defiant, several of which are still flying. Later, a Dehavilland Tiger Moth (WWI-era) shows up. OK. Forget about the ill-chosen airplanes.There is a woman in the front (observer) seat of the Stearman when it is hit and downed by German anti-aircraft fire. Who was she? I don't recall anyone mentioning her. OK, forget about the unknown lady who burns to death.Speaking of burning to death, how did the pilot escape? If the fuel tank was in the front of the airplane, which it apparently was supposed-to-be (I'm not an expert on Stearmans), then he had about ten seconds, at 200 mph, before he is burned alive. Okay. He only suffered some burn to his face. The fire looked rather serious to me.Next, we have the nurse in the back of a truck, riding alongside a jeep containing her friendly, cheery nurse friend. Her wonderful friend (maybe the only person in the film who we actually like) promptly hits a land-mine and she dies. Why? What purpose does this serve? How is this carnage part of the plot?Why is the field hospital shelled (by the Germans?)? How does this contribute to our understanding of the story?Excited yet? Me neither. After her fellow-nurse friend is killed, she decides to basically desert her post and derelict her duties by taking the afore-mentioned, facially-burned pilot to a church that appears abandoned to her. She was wearing an army helmet (from WWI), so I assume she was an Army nurse. This is desertion. Honorable enough, if we are given a solid reason for her taking this risk and putting herself in such jeopardy for another individual human being. We are given no such reason.She finds a king-sized bed for him, as well as mosquito netting, food, water and fuel and supplies to cook with. Not bad, for a place on the front lines of battle.After that, this kooky guy shows up, (played by Willem DaFoe). Let me get this straight: He says he is in the same Canadian Military unit as some people who know her, he is just ""checking up"" on her, and that he ""lives"" nearby? He is also her neighbor in Montreal, Canada? Not very likely.Once he gets inside the church where the burned guy is, he proceeds to insult the guy who is recovering, questioning his identity. WTF?After the ""insult the handicapped guy"" scene, we are brought to a somewhat elegant get-together, where (mostly British?) people in formal attire are chatting about their stocks and shares. This is when I turned the movie off. This movie could have excelled had it been done by a small budget, independent, foreign (Italian or French) film maker and a screen-writer who knows how to create compelling and meaningful dialogue. This way, it could have adhered to the plot and intention of the novel.",The English Patient

113,littlemartinarocena,Anthony Minghella's Heart and Mind,9,19 May 2009,"It is a strangely powerful and moving experience to see ""The English Patient"" again after Anthony Minghella's death. Most of his body of work is dedicated to one shattering point. The endless moral struggle of those who, consciously, walk a very thin line. In ""The Talented Mr Ripley"" Minghella moves away from Patricia Highsmith's amoral Tom Ripley to give the murderer a conscience. In ""Breaking And Entering"" Minghella gives Jude Law's character the need to confess and the rewards are chillingly moving. Here, in ""The English Patient"", the characters in love are never too far away from their corroding feeling of guilt. Ralph Finnes and Kristin Scott Thomas are extraordinary. They strip their characters from every pretense in a compelling complicity with us, the audience. Juliette Binoche is, quite simply, spectacular and her scenes with the wonderful Naveen Andrews are filled with a ""Minghellian"" sensual innocence. Anthony Minghella gave us films that were,one way or another, that elusive mix of art and commerce. He was true to himself but thought about his audience. He knew how to push our buttons without betraying his own. There is something clear, honest and startling about Minghella's opus. I miss him already but I'm grateful for the reflection of his soul he left behind.",The English Patient
114,georgioskarpouzas,a complex herodotian story of love and war,7,3 March 2010,"I have watched this movie when it was first released in my country without having formed a clear picture of it's action and plot but being impressed by it's visual imagery and the names of the actors present. Recently I read the book and afterwards watched the movie again. This time I acquired a much clearer view of both the film and the book.There are many things to comment in such a complex movie but what I found the most interesting is that it tells a story(or rather stories) of people of different backgrounds and races while war forms the unifying thread of the narrative. In this sense it is very much a history as Herodotus would have conceived it-Herodotus who is mentioned as the favourite writer of the central hero. Also one of his most famous novellas is narrated in the film by the heroine Catherine, a rather lecherous story, told by a heroine about to commit adultery.This is a film about the consuming human passions:sexual love, war, the yearning to explore the unknown, revenge. It is an eminently humanistic film depicting humans with their characteristic frailties(warts and all as the English say)but never in a cheap or demeaning manner.Ralph Fiennes gives a fine performance as Count Almasy, both as a rush young-to middle-aged man and as the deformed crippled patient. He is an explorer, adulterer, adventurer and someone forced by circumstances to take sides(the wrong-that is the one who lost) in war, in which he had no personal interest.Christin Scott Thomas is perfect as the vain, classy, intelligent and ultimately unlucky British lady whose fate become intermingled with that of Almasy because of mutual lust.She also has some fine erotic scenes within the logic of a mainstream movie.Juliette Binoche gives an understated performance of the compassionate nurse who caters for the deformed and sick Almasy.Her likable physique renders a likable character.Naveen Andrews is credible as the Sikh sapper of the British army who falls in love with the nurse although his character, military training, ideological convictions are much curtailed in the movie compared with the details devoted to them in the book.Willem Dafoe has the style and face to play the cunning and controversial character of David Caravaggio, a former thief enlisted to the allied cause.Collin Firth has the appearance and acumen of British gentleman in Africa and bears with stiff upper lip the suspicions of his wife's infidelity until his jealousy overcomes him leading him to suicidal actions.Some other minor characters people this multi layered movie, having flat characteristics opposed to the ambiguities and moral ambivalence of the main personae.The desert and the colonial metropolis of Cairo are presented in an inspiring manner while Italy at the end of world war two is portrayed with minimalist simplicity.It is a good movie about the perennial passions of the human soul played on the vast canvas of the Libyan desert and the Italian peninsula as interesting and charming human beings are entrapped in a conjecture that overcomes them. The device of the flashback is also more appropriate and comprehensible in the movie than in the book on which it is based.",The English Patient

Well........about 80% of ""The English Patient"" (1998) is soap-opera/ tear jerker stuff, and that's not my cup of tea, to use an English phrase of fame.However, I stuck out watching the whole (very long) movie because it won the Best Picture Academy Award for it's year, and a lot of people thought it was good (almost 400 people reviewed it for Amazon.Com as I write this in late 2012).I noticed good parts of the movie, and they made me reflect that ""every cloud has a silver lining"" regarding bad movies in the sense that often, especially in big expensive movies like ""The English Patient"" (1998), a lot of trouble is taken to show ""counterpoint"" stuff quite opposite from the grim, sad themes and events the (masochistic, to my thinking) audience gets its face shoved into for most of the movie.Life for English participants in the pre-WWII British Empire in places like Egypt, and especially in regional colonial centers like the capital city of Cairo, was pretty good. The English had a lot of money which was used largely to import, wholesale, the ""good life"" from England.All over the Empire, importation/ set-up occurred of wonderful, full service hotels with great dining rooms, wonderful food (which England is not famous for back home in England), and tuxedoed dance bands playing Cole Porter and Irving Berlin movie tune music for tuxedoed and gowned couples.The managerial class, at least, lived well during it's leisure time all over the pre-WWII British Empire, and before 1939 (before 1948, actually) the sun never set on it.Singapore, Delhi, Cairo, Jamaica, Montreal, Capetown, and many other British colony countries boasted terrific hotels, dining rooms, and dance bands, and romantic, sometimes adulterous Brit couples (now long dead) could trip the light fantastic in wonderful exotic places much better to live in than the home country, England.Willing, efficient, attractive servants with no ideas of revolt helped out. Prices were cheap, and good times were many.This was one of the good parts about the British Empire, at least for many who were part of it, helped it run, or ended up in Brit. Empire outposts like Cairo and got in on it all for whatever reasons, and with whatever credentials.""The English Patient"" (1998) shows this side of the pre-WWII British Empire in Egypt during the course of the movie....not much, and not for long, relative to the rest of the famously long movie....but enough to be worthwhile, and to see good places and good times for British subjects depicted away from dreary England, with it's famously bad weather and bad food, and oppressive class system (oppressive for non-upper class people).The good times are over, but ""The English Patient"" (1998) provides an important ""homage"" to it all.........afternoon tea dances, well dressed, healthy blue-eyed white people eating good food at leisure in palm-tree decorated dining rooms looking out onto lovely, exotic views all over the world.Nice work if you can get it! ------------------- Written by Tex (David) Allen, SAG movie actor.Email to TexAllen@Rocketmail.Com Biography details about Tex at WWW.IMDb.Me/TexAllen",The English Patient

Although I wasn't bored out of my skull while watching The English Patient, I will say most of the people who loved it and registered their comments here are perhaps of the type who feel cinema is trite unless emotionally isolated, performed by actors of the stage and produced in Europe.   We saw this happen previously when Howard's End won all the awards for being a smartly acted, beautifully detailed, and ultimately yawn inspiring experience.  The English Patient is much better, even entertaining in parts, but alas is nothing more than an expensive looking coffee table film everyone has to see and love when they fancy themselves intellectually enlightened  in the matter of high brow entertainment.  If you are not absolutely enamored with Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott-Thomas you will not care to hang on to their every word in order to explore the depth of their love affair.  The most interesting character is the Nurse portrayed by Juliette Binoche, and it is through her screen time we find what meanings are more apparent, especially when she frees both her patient and herself from their respective physical and emotional tortures and leaves the monastery accepting of the risks and sacrifices love demands in order to know it.

122,JackCerf,Pretty But Politically Distatsteful,5,7 August 2006,"This is just Catch-22 with romance and gorgeous scenery. Like Yossarian, Almasy sees the great sacred cow of World War Two as simply an intrusion on his individual happiness and a threat to his personal well being.When Caravaggio tells Almasy that thousands of people had died because he helped the Germans, Almasy replies ""thousands of other people would have died if I hadn't."" Whether the deaths were Allied or Axis is morally neutral to him, compared to his need to recover the body of his dead lover. We are meant to sympathize with his romantic loyalty and political indifference.Almasy is presented as an exile without country or politics, whose only homeland is his pocket Herodotus. (The historical Almasy was actually a Hungarian officer serving in the Luftwaffe and assigned to Rommel's headquarters, but that's just dramatic license.) Katherine is an instinctive Little Englander who longs to leave Egypt for a garden in Dorsetshire; she loves neither her husband nor the imperial project in which he is deeply involved. The romance between Hana and Kip is equally anti-political. She is a French Canadian, he a Sikh, both members of subject peoples serving a British Empire in which they have no stake, and they drop out of the war to make a private space for themselves.English Patient is the anti-Casablanca. It's perspective is that the problems of two little people are the only thing that amounts to a hill of beans in this crazy world, and that the intrusions of history, politics and war are simply a curse.

125,bob-790-196018,'History Is a Nightmare from which I Am Trying to Awake',9,14 March 2011,"The quotation from Joyce's Stephen Dedalus came to mind while watching this movie about a handful of people living through the nightmare of World War II. The drama in this movie arises from the conflict between the personal and the political, between mass movement driven by global forces and the deeply personal matters of love, sex, friendship, and loyalty. While The English Patient is epic in scope, the story never wanders from its focus on this handful of individuals--a testimony to skillful writing and direction.As often happens, sex and romantic love are subversive forces. In a scene in which a gathering of British troops celebrate Christmas and sing Silent Night and God Save the Queen, only one thin wall separates their piety from the passionate and adulterous lovemaking of Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas.The things that matter in politics and history are seen as labels. Ralph Fiennes plays a Hungarian count (though one who seemingly knows every American pop song ever written) yet is identified as ""the English patient."" Eventually the English come to believe he is German and imprison him. When he escapes and encounters German forces, he gives them his maps (thereby enabling them to infiltrate the British in Cairo and eventually attack them) out of desperation to save his lover. His loyalty to her is all that matters to him.

128,sbox,Beautiful Film Destroyed by Banal Characters,4,9 August 1999,"It's hard to give a rot for this film.  Consider the characters and their actions.  First, the ""love affair"" is suspect.  The torrid affair borders more on infatuation and selfish indulgence, punctuated by a bizarre scene in the midst of a Red Cross, Christmas dinner for soldiers.  Such offensive behavior barely bothers the paramours as they so dimly illuminate later on, ""we are the real countries.""Perhaps this belief is why Fienes' character was adroit at treason. Numbskulls are supposed to believe that Count Laszlo was forced to deal with the Germans in order to keep his promise with his gal (the real country). Not so fast.  He had his chance with the British first.  Not only did he seal his own fate by extremely strange behavior, we never get to see him commit treason with the Germans.  We are just told about it.  I posit that scenes with the Count selling out the British for a plane would properly trash his character.The Count's love interest is an educated yet indifferent figure.   She marries a lifelong friend and suffers (shazam) an indifferent marriage. She reads poetry well and states her views.  This is nice window dressing but no more.  Despite cheating on a husband she doesn't love and surviving his murder- suicide attempt, she remains stoic to the end.  Barf!  Plane crashes hurt, especially the ones you don't walk away from.  She didn't.  Her lover, the Count had to carry her a long way, while  she labored through dignified comments ad nauseum.And what about that husband of hers?  Despite the fact that he gets weird and attempts to kill the love triangle (literally), we don't see him devolve into suicidal depression, it just happens.Now on to the other characters which reside years after the tragedy of the love triangle.  First we tackle the Indian Army officer.  His initial entry into the film is accompanied by his no nonsense style in which he makes it clear he is not interested in the English Patient's nurse.  He changes his mind in a nice scene in which he lays out a candle trail to his heart. This really worked.  Unfortunately, by the end of the film, it all ends up, ""wham bam, thank you ma'am.""  Of course they will always have their church in which he gave her an art lesson.  This really makes no sense to me except to validate one night stands as legitimate love affairs.The nurse herself is the most disappointing character.  She is distraught after seeing a friend die.  This triggers something within her that demands that she take a hiatus from the war to care for the English Patient.  She works really hard and does well for him while contending with various interlopers.  The really frightening scene is how she emotionally euthanizes her ward upon his request.  She would never have done this at the outset. However, after learning about his situation, she wisely decides that he is better off dead.  I'm sure utilitarians are satisfied by these events.  As for me, I'm appalled.The only benevolent character seems to be the man sans thumbs.  His dark search which doesn't involve redemption actually receives it.  He is a triumphant figure who trades in darkness for good.  However, this man's limited involvement in the film isn't enough to balance the rest.A summation of this film is to compare it to a trashy drugstore novel. The characters wear pretty clothes, engage in ""forbidden"" sex, and suffer tragic ends.  Romance fulfilled.",The English Patient

The music by Gabriel Yared (one of my favorite film composers) is wonderful. In the technical aspects, it's great. My best friend, who is European, absolutely loves it. But when I watched her ""The English Patient"" video, I had a hard time caring. Frankly, I was bored. It's okay to have unlikable characters in a movie, and sometimes even have them be your protagonists, and if they happen to be star-crossed lovers-hey, even better. That's sort of unique, or at least not as cliched as most other romantic relationships in film. But I just couldn't really care about what became of these people, not because they were ""immoral"" but because they were boring. I keep on thinking maybe I should watch it again and see if it grows on me. Some movies are like that. As for the Academy Awards, well, this movie is done very well. But it sort of makes me sad to think that a pretty, passionless picture like this is considered the best that was done in an entire year.

131,kira02bit,A romance as dry as the desert in which it is set,3,25 April 2006,"First off, this movie is certainly one of the most beautifully shot that I have seen in a while. The desert vistas and gorgeous Italian scenery are beautiful to behold. Then again, there are far better films that provide these same elements.Director Anthony Minghella puts together all of the elements which should have resulted in a haunting romantic spectacle, but someone forgot to strike the sparks required to set it ablaze. Nurse Juliette Binoche (whose bone structure contributes her performance) stays behind at a secluded abandoned monastery in the waning days of WW2 in order to care for enigmatic burn victim Ralph Fiennes, who slowly conveys his sad tale of illicit love, betrayal and tragedy which led to his current predicament.There are a number of problems which plague the film. First, is its self-indulgent length. I have nothing against lengthy films or miniseries, so long as there is a suitable amount going on to require the length. Nearly every subordinate character is given some sort of clichéd back story to enact in addition to the central romance - be it the nurse, her Sikh paramour who defuses bombs, or his friend. The film is already grossly overlong before Willem Dafoe (in a weak performance) shows up for no purpose whatsoever other than to introduce the concept that Fiennes may be a spy. The Dafoe character could have been easily excised and his function added to Binoche. Naturally, Dafoe's entire back story gets to be enacted in a series of tedious flashbacks. Ironically, no back story/flashbacks are reserved for Colin Firth, who is responsible for setting the climactic events into motion but previously is all but forgotten by the screenplay.Where the film really fails is that it must be the most deadly romance in recent memory. Fiennes and Kristin Scott-Thomas, as the married woman with whom he dallies, can be amazing actors singularly. However, they are both known for their cool, aloof reserved performances. You can certainly have a fine romance with two outgoing actors in the leads; you have a good shot with opposite-style actors (one vibrant, the other reserved), but casting two self-contained cool personalities at the center of a film that is trying to be a classy romance for the ages proves to be a disaster. They have all the appeal of being pelted in the face with cold wet sardines and even the inclusion of full-frontal nudity (courtesy of Scott-Thomas) fails to raise the heat level above a frozen tundra. Their total lack of chemistry is hardly helped by sporadically groan-inducing dialog like when Fiennes asserts lustily that ""I can still taste you.""

133,stefanhoeffllin,All time classic!,10,24 September 2000,"I hate movies you can forget 5 minutes after watching them. Maybe that sounds a little pathetic now, but I think movies should be made for eternity. I mean real big movies like ""Dances with wolves"", ""Schindler´s list"" etc. ""The english patient"", Anthony Minghella´s adaptation of Michael Ondaatje´s novel, is one of this kind. This is my true imagination of cinema, not a fast-food movie . Ask a 13 year old boy what ""Casablanca, and he will answer ""A sort of chocolate"". Sad but true. Don´t misunderstand me, folks, I´ve got nothing against pure entertainment, sometimes I want to turn off my brain, too. To all those people who didn´t like this film: I suppose you had your problems with all those flashbacks, isn´t it? This a love story you should turn on your head to let the emotions work. It´s about how the war destroyed the love between the  people. Not to mention I really loved Gabriel Yared´s beautiful and epic score, John´s Seale´s great work as cameraman and of course all the actors, from Ralph Fiennes to Willem Dafoe. ""The english patient"" has deserved every single of its 9 Oscars. Possibly one of the best movies ever made. Unforgettable!",The English Patient
134,Edu-16,"Perfect, draining and stimulating",10,15 January 2000,"Not much point adding to the praise already heaped on this movie.  I've read through a number of critiques and it seems that many are of the same opinions about this glorious film.  I was surprised to see a few negative points made though.  Two of which I'd like to address.'We disliked the film because I didnt like any of the characters' - or variations on this.  - This was an odd criticism I thought to make about a movie.  I don't think that I liked the main characters very much myself. Selfish people who pursued their passion at the expense of all others.  But for me, it was this that elevated the film to greatness since despite my feelings towards the lovers, I was still shattered by the ending.  I'm not sure you can criticise a movie because you don't like the characters portrayed within.  Seems a bit unfair.  This film just doesn't make any compromises to the modern taste.  The characters were honest ones, beautifully played and I didnt have to 'like' them.  The second class of comments I reacted to here were along the lines of - 'It was boring and tedious - nothing happens'.  This is so much more a reflection of the reviewer than of the film that I'm quite glad to see these comments here.  There are certain items of intellectual equipment that you need to appreciate this film, and sadly not everyone has them.  Perhaps not everyone wants them of course (certainly not governments!).  99/100 films are made for the lowest common denominator - (with the money to go to the cinema that is!).  Every so often, you get a film that requires the audience to 'think' and to have attention spans of more than the length of a Cola add.One of the greatest movies of all time.",The English Patient
135,yevonwm,The best film of all time.,8,27 August 2011,"Now let me start by balancing my review :P This film isn't perfect, the story is pretty slow in parts, not so much the first time you watch it but after that there's bits that take a long time to add little value to the film. Also let me say I'm not some art student, fan of art-house films or anything other than a normal movie goer so I don't really understand people using big words to review a film.However I am happy to say that this is the best film of all time. I've watched a lot of films to the point where I've almost run out, I've worked my way through other peoples lists of 'best films of all time ever' and gave them a fair chance. But this film is fantastic! The reason why I like it is very soft I'm afraid, it's such a raw depiction of how real relationships happen. You become completely immersed in the unspoken desires of the core characters, you *will* the relationship to unfold and if something goes wrong you're screaming ""NNNNOAAARRRRRRRRRRGGGGHHHH"". You can imagine times that the same thing has happened to you but your life did/did not pan out like that.Ralph Feinnes does what he does best, plays a reserved Englishman masking incredibly intense emotions as best he can. In other films it's not appropriate and you can see that his range is quite narrow but here he slots in perfectly. Kristin Scott Thomas does exactly the same with flair. Everything else about the film is technically perfect. If you haven't seen this film then you're missing something special.",The English Patient

139,folsominc2,Are you Patient enough for this?,2,19 March 2008,"OK, what was this story about again? I am afraid that I never read the book and frankly, this was one of the most confusing movies that I have ever tried to watch in a long time. I get a bit confused on the number of flashbacks between the nurse, the patient and the man with no thumbs. The film didn't even really explain what they were looking for in the desert until they found it; or even how in the world they all knew each other to come together.After recently seeing the ""Pride and Prejudice"" movie with Colin Firth, I have been trying to do a study on his film career by watching other movies of his, and bluntly, other than ""What a Girl Wants"" I am not finding much where he played in that was any good. I am definitely not saying that HE wasn't good. He is really one of the best actors I have seen in the modern day film, but the content and quality of the films he plays in have a lot to be desired.""The English Patient"" is another perfect example of where the director, writer, and crew are just too close to their subject matter to see that the viewer is not getting the picture  literally. The entire movie seemed to be to showcase Ralph Fiennes as a dramatic actor with long periods of emoting that was a bore. Nothing is really explained and every one of the subjects from the beginning seems to need a psychoanalyst evaluation! Kristin Scott Thomas' character seems to enjoy describing erotic stories standing in front of a totally male audience and titillating other men other than her husband; Colin Firth, who plays her husband, does not necessarily have all his marbles in place and is supposed to be a secret agent  I guess; and Ralph Fiennes walks around like a Roman Mr. Darcy (sorry, Colin!) who thinks he knows it all. The rest of the cast is cast (pun intended) to the four winds as the plot wanders on.The subplot of the mental stability of the nurse (Juliette Binoche) and her motives and involvement with Naveen Andrews is another confusing element that leaves the viewer with an unsavory taste. But of course, the viewer is still reeling how in the world the first two characters (Thomas and Fiennes) ended up having sex the first time anyway. What was the attraction? There was no chemistry and no build-up. Just a slap, bam, thank you! And isn't it romantic that Fiennes ended up a traitor helping the Germans by giving them maps to the desert? (sarcasm) To describe this movie, I would have to simply say, ""How to impress your gynecologist with your mammograms and cheat on your sweet, adorable husband who loves you."" The final unbelievable section of this plot is to fathom how anyone would choose Ralph Fiennes over Colin Firth. Firth had very little opportunity to demonstrate any of his acting talents  in fact, when watching the movie, I thought it must have been one of his first. The scene where he had been waiting for his wife all night was perhaps the only two second clip that is worth seeing in the movie. At that, I have no interest in watching it again.The best scene I liked was the plane crash where Firth is trying to take them all out. Too bad he missed! It would have saved an extra twenty minutes of even more fruitless film. Aerial desert scenes were pretty neat, though.",The English Patient
140,jkd15-1,A great Love Story,10,8 May 2008,How this film gets low marks is beyond me. I certainly believe in the right to free speech but come on people.The English Patient is a story of love between two people brought together by WWII.I was immersed throughout and brought to the brink of tears at the end.The story and sub plots revolve around a man and a woman who fall in love and the consequences of their actions due to this.A film with murderous jealousy and revenge. A film that takes one from the deadly grips of the dessert to lovemaking in a bathtub. From Nazi interrogations to disarming bombs. From horrible plane crashes to celebration.An epic film of love lust murder and escape.One of the best films of the last 20 years.Sit back with a huge tub of pop corn and be entertained.

141,martin-intercultural,"Good film, slightly overrated",8,27 December 2017,"I watched this film 20+ years after its original release. I did have some apprehensions - e.g. I thought it was ""about the war""; and I knew for a fact it was very long.
Overall, it has aged well. To my relief, the plot is not so much about the war, but rather about civilian people swept up in the war. 
Was the movie too long? It was. Not necessarily boring or dragged out sort of long, mind you. But I do think the tale could have been told just as powerfully in 90 minutes as it was in 162: The man with no face - use him to frame the story; lose the rest. Punjabi guy searching for landmines and/or washing his hair? I am all for a good interracial romp, onscreen and off, but really -- what did he add to the story? Cut. The Willem Dafoe character? Cut. 
Lastly, and not to be a complete heretic: I love French cinema, and I can see how the part-Slavic La Binoche may have been a revelation to 90s US audiences, what with her Deneuve-esque power of projection coupled with a Bette Davis-style ability to ""do nothing"" in the face of great turmoil. Personally I found her role in this film to be one of a glorified narrator, whose presence could have been confined to under ten minutes. And not only that. In truth, some of her zany but wholesome antics, midway through, set in the ruins of the bombed-out cloister, actually brought to mind the words ""Nokia. Connecting People"". Sorry; they did. 
Ultimately, all of the above contributes little to, and greatly pales in comparison with, the main story, acted out solidly by Ralph Fiennes and rivetingly, refreshingly yet timelessly by Kristin Scott Thomas. This is where the wow factor is; we didn't need the distractions which only served to bloat this saga to nearly three hours in length.",The English Patient

But it is by far one of the greatest film I've ever seen, and way better than any other action-thriller! Why do people have to be so naive, and behave like kids? Why can't they realize that EVERYTHING about this film is superb, extraordinary and well done. It deserved all the damn Oscars it got, although I was hoping for the amazing Ralph Fiennes to get one too. The acting was at it's finest, the camera-work, cinematography and directing couldn't have gotten any better. To summon things up = it was just a beautiful movie! And usually I would have said that people can think whatever they want about movies, but to think this is boring and undeserving of it's 9 (!) Oscars is just plain stupid. This is one of my all time favorite movies and I can watch it a hundred times more, and still not get bored (I won't really do that) because I understand the meaning of this film. It's about two things: 1. Love and 2. War. It's simple really, but the way everything is put together is just remarkable. So please watch this magnificent film, but not with low hopes.

I'm not saying the movie is bad, but its flaws are what I've pointed out above, and if a film has a good cast and acting but lasts much too much, loses most of its charm. Similar examples include Magnolia or Gandhi, being the latter one I haven't seen nor I think I ever will.

I think it gets nearly everything right. The cast is magnificent, the narrative approach highly effective, the cinematography and direction outstanding. The script is so intelligent - much could be said about the multiple examples of symmetry and contrast, between individuals, present and past, circumstances etc. One reason all the cast deliver such terrific performances is that they are given wonderful material to work with, as characters they are all fully fleshed out and convincing. To me it bears comparison with the epics of David Lean. I only have two criticisms and neither amounts to much. One is that, OK, it is sentimental, but I don't find it excessively so. The later cave of swimmers scenes are so moving! I love them. The second criticism is that there are various implausibilities, like Fiennes being able to make his way from a train track in the middle of nowhere to the place where the plane is held. And I don't think the characters would bump into each other quite as much as they do.

It could have been at least 15 minutes shorter without cutting a single scene, and the characters were a bit too self-centered for me to want to identify to them. Also, it is probably the most sordid movie I can ever remember seeing.However, this movie WAS well-made (in a technical sense). The direction was good (except for the creepy-crawly pacing), the scenery and cinematography was beautiful, and the acting was great. This film was quite diverting in this aspect, and it deserved many of its Academy Awards. . .Except for Best Picture. Why? This movie simply doesn't contribute much to cinema as a whole. Sure, it's well-made, but it's not very original. Artists have to fight hard for romances to be original, and this movie just didn't fight hard enough. The characters, while well-portrayed, aren't the kind you remember for the rest of your life. It's the kind of movie you rent and enjoy for a time or two. For movie makers and storywriters, it can also give you some general (but not specific) inspiration. But then you move on, and this movie is forgotten.My suggestion? See above.

An hour into it I knew why I had skipped this awful, stereotypical movie. I could not subject myself to 2 more hours of unnnnngggghhhhh!'The English Patient' is nothing more than an overrated, formula-using wartime romance with a pace that more resembles geological time scales than human. The plot itself - battle-injured soldier develops romance with nurse - is a cliché-ridden, often-used formula. Admittedly, there are some deviations from this - the man's terminal injuries, the additional characters of the young Sikh and the thief, but they are not enough to save this long-drawn-out, thoroughly DULL film. Nor is the photography, which so many people and critics laud as contributing to this film's misplaced 'masterpiece' status. To be fair, some of the scenery is marvelous but again it is not enough to justify 3 hours. Avoid this piece of junk at all costs.

155,DesbUK,Anthony Minghella's most famous film is worth re-watching,8,1 April 2008,"The unexpected death of the English film director and screenwriter Anthony Minghella in March 2008 prompted me to re-watch his greatest triumph on DVD again. It's a curious film which has as many detractors as admirers. 'The English Patient' was released in 1996 and won nine Oscars (including Best Director for Minghella) and six British Academy Awards (including Best Adapted Screenplay for Minghella).Filmed on location in Italy and Tunisia, with a mostly British cast (Ralph Fiennes, Kristin Scott Thomas, Colin Firth, Naveen Andrews, Julian Wadham, Kevin Whatley) plus the French Juliette Binoche and the American William Dafoe - 'The English Patient' confirms Minghella as the most literary and romantic of English filmmakers - his movies are considerably distanced from any kind of reality. Often compared to David Lean, this film mixes elements of 'Brief Encounter' (adultery accompanied by classical piano concertos) and 'Lawrence of Arabia' (a passion for the desert). John Seale's camera and Stuart Craig's quite remarkable production design conjure up two remote and distant worlds. The first is the North African deserts in 1938/39, where Count Almasy (Fiennes) and the English couple Geoffrey and Katherine Clifton (Firth and Thomas) are members of the International Sand Club, a group of explorers mapping the desert. Almasy begins an ill-fated affair with Clifton's wife.In 1945, Almasy is the anonymous 'English patient', bed-ridden and disfigured by an air crash. He spends his days in an abandoned Italian monastery being cared for by a French Canadian nurse called Hana (Binoche). Also there is a morphine addicted allied spy called Carravagio (Dafoe) and two British Army bomb disposal men (Andrews and Whatley). The monastery gives a sense of an awkward end of World-War 2 meeting point of various races and nationalities: Eastern European, Canadian, Sikh and British.But this description affords Minghella's screenplay a linear clarity which isn't there. We constantly cut between the North African and Cairo of 1938/39 and the Italy of 1945. The late 30s become a place of Almasy's memories, where he retreats to in his final frail dying days. The opening and closing shots of the film are both the same - Almasy's final flight in a bi-plane containing Katherine's body. Geoffrey - grief stricken by the knowledge of his wife's betrayal - tried to kill the three of them by crashing his bi-plane. Almasy had to leave the injured Katherine a desert cave whilst he walked across the desert for help. Eventually, all he can do is give the German army the maps of the desert in exchange for a bi-plane to go and rescue Katherine. She is, of course, long dead.Best of all, Minghella brings consistently good performances from the entire cast. Twentieth Century Fox didn't want Kristin Scott Thomas for the Katherine role in The English Patient - they wanted Demi Moore. And without her, Fox withdrew from the film (it was eventually financed by Miramax). Minghella's loyalty to Scott Thomas was not only rewarded by her Oscar and BAFTA nominations, but by the fact it's impossible to imagine very many actresses conveying Katherine's luminous beauty and intelligence in the same way - it makes us understand why her husband Geoffrey (Colin Firth) would kill himself on becoming so engulfed with grief and jealousy on discovering her affair with Almasy. Is she England's most beautiful actress? There's an astonishing scene when we see her full frontal nude getting out of a bath - a thirty-something blonde just oozing sex and charm. It's hard not to feel saddened when she dies alone in the desert cave.'The English Patient' is a complex novel and Minghella's adaptation of the book is a version of it. Give the same book to, say, Ronald Harwood or Christopher Hampton, and a very different adaptation might emerge. It's hard not to still admire Minghella's screen craft as a director, even when you're bored and confused by the leaps in time. He includes a gripping set-piece of Kip attempting to defuse a bomb beneath a bridge which threatens to be detonated by rumble of on-coming Allied tanks. He handles the period atmosphere quite magnificently, the atmosphere of worn and war-torn oldness in 1945, of stillness, space and heat in the monastery and desert, something which gives these characters a chance to speak, to be heard, to emote in their own space - all without distraction. The atmosphere so engulfs you that upon emerging from the viewing you feel you're emerging back into reality.",The English Patient

I think I made it through a third of the way before deciding to stop annoying myself with this (thus five stars because maybe it gets better later?).Firstly, the main actor is a total bore. I've seen him in a few other movies and he only has one facial expression and one tone of voice, and can give his characters only one dimension. Granted his character could barely speak half of the time, but he was still boring. The wife also had only on expression, which was rather boring.The nurse was great to watch, but her deciding to stay in the middle of nowhere with one patient? Not buying it. Apparently they barely need to eat, and I can't tell what season it is because everyone but she were wearing jackets; she opted for a summer dress.

The reason I viewed this movie is the director is the same person who made the movie ""Cold Mountain"". I really liked that movie, and wanted to see if the same magic of the civil war romance would be on this world war 2 romance. It had some basic elements that were the same on both movies, such as strong character development and a romance in the context of war.However, I felt rather bored viewing this movie as compared to Cold Mountain. I think Cold Mountain had far more interesting characters than this one, and I never felt board watching through it as this one. However, it had an excellent ending to the story, and overall it was an excellent story - just the pace was too slow and difficult to connect with the story. Perhaps it would resonate better with someone who was alive during, or just after that era (which to me is in the same boat as the civil war) since most of the positive reviews are from older audiences.",The English Patient

Elaine, did you just see The English Patient?GAIL: (tearful) Didn't you love it?LISA: How could you not love that movie?******ELAINE: How about, it sucked?********Blaine gives Elaine a strange look.(later on the episode)LISA: We just saw The English Patient again.GAIL: It's even better the second time.********ELAINE: They make it longer?***********ELAINE: I thought you were busy tonight.BLAINE: (cold) Well, to tell you the truth Elaine. I don't know if I can be with someone who doesn't like The English Patient.******* ELAINE: It's just a stupid movie.**********========================================================== That's the bottom line - it's a stupid movie. I thought I was missing out on something by not liking it, but apparently I wasn't the only one. I even tried renting it after it came on video and it was still boring and long and slow. If you want an action, packed, edge-of-your-seat, emotion-packed love story - DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!!! You will be let down, disappointed and bored!!!That being said, I still adore Ralph Fiennes. Put movie on mute and watch it and you got some good eye candy there.",The English Patient
160,Rod-54,Film and story of the decade,10,17 May 2000,"Having seen this for the second time recently I realised I had not commented.  In my view this is a great film, based on a great story.  In fact, in a rare instance, the film is better than the book, the writing style in which made it seem to drag.  Not so the film.  It has the usual grand themes of love, death and the futility of war but it interweaves these beautifully.  In fact, the way the subplots unfold together is exceptional. The stories are tragic but pointed and very emotive.  The performances, the settings and the cinematography are all very very good.  This is not to be missed and it is one for the library.",The English Patient
161,Reb9,"Dull, pretentious clap-trap.",1,25 May 1999,There just isn't anything good to say about this nonsense.

Instead, it turns these two lustful maniacs into all of the above.It was like rooting for Mickey and Mallory from ""Natural Born Killers"".

163,mattymatt30,An epic tale of doomed love,9,19 March 2004,"'The English Patient' can rightly be compared to the films of David Lean, whose sweeping epics such as 'Lawrence of Arabia' and 'Bridge on the River Kwai' must have inspired the director Anthony Minghella. The film is beautifully photographed, and like 'Lawrence', is set in Northern Africa, but during the second world war.  The story is complex, but it boils down to a forbidden love between an opinionated and often difficult archeologist played by Ralph Fiennes and a married woman played by Kristin Scott Thomas.
  The story, based on a novel by Michael Ondaatje, is told in flashbacks by Fiennes' Count Laszlo de Almasy  - the titular character.  The fact that his name does not sound like he's English plays a key role in what unfolds. He has been badly burned in a plane crash, occurring just as the film opens, and is being cared for back in Europe by Hana, an army nurse played by Juliette Binoche. What makes this story epic is the vast sweep across place and time, and the development of characters beyond that of the two ill-fated lovers.     The film makes clear that true love and passion, even with dreaded consequences, can make life worth living, or worth dying for. If you're a romantic at heart, and can appreciate a film without the standard happy endings and simple moral codes, you may find that 'The English Patient' speaks directly to you.",The English Patient

165,thechosen1,Excellent = Ralph Fiennes,9,9 August 2002,"Now, here you have one of the best movies ever starring some of the best actors ever....Ralph Fiennes (brilliant, brilliant, brilliant), Willem Dafoe, Kristin Scott Thomas, Juliette Binoche.  This movie was very touching and extremely well made.  It explores the characters to great depths and gradually unfolds each of their stories.  Every minute was worth watching and it definitely did not disappoint me in any aspect.  Also, it was one of the very few movies which had a very good ending.Ralph Fiennes (as Laszlo De Almasy) was just pure brilliance (and as good looking as one can possibly get).  His performance was just amazing, considering that he is unable to move during most of the movie, so his expressions were absolutely incredible. He has deserved every Oscar nomination that he has got.  Willem Dafoe (Caravaggio), as usual, gave a fine performance to an otherwise, dry character. The best thing about Dafoe is that he can make relatively dull characters actually have their presence felt in the movie. No doubt, one of Hollywood's greatest actors.  Juliette Binoche (Hana), not only looked beautiful, she also showed that she is a superb actress.  Just her expressions in the interaction with Fiennes in the movie did her character complete justice.I just love the way Kristin Scott Thomas (Katherine) plays her roles.  She just seems so natural to it all.  Her dialogue delivery and facial expressions were excellent.Highly recommended.  10/10.",The English Patient
166,supernma,"A beautiful, heartbreaking piece of cinema",10,22 June 2010,"The English Patient is one of the most beautiful and tragic romances ever put on film. A truly haunting and mesmerizing experience that will stay with you long after it's over.First of all, the cinematography is gorgeously breathtaking. The desert hasn't looked so enchanting since 'Lawrence of Arabia.' Also, the costumes, sets and locations are all superb. If anything, it's a fantastic film to look at. The score is also amazing and never fails to move me to tears at certain moments (especially the climactic sequence). The script is brilliant as well. The film balances the multiple story lines and time periods perfectly, and never becomes confusing or crowded.In addition to the visual/technical aspects, the acting is nearly perfect. Every actor gives a subtle performance filled with depth and history. The viewer can really feel their emotions, whether it be passionate lust or painful anguish. I couldn't really choose a favorite character as I ended up engrossed in all their lives equally enthralled.It's a sweeping epic in the vein of old Hollywood (similar to Titanic's style), but ""The English Patient"" is much more mature and heartbreaking, in my opinion, with a certain kind of cinematic poetry that we don't see enough of. It's the kind of film where you feel like you're reading someone else's journal or diary, except, of course, on a much grander scale. I'd highly recommend reading the novel by Michael Ondaatje, as well. In fact, it's more comparable to reading a classic romance novel, with all their history and vivid descriptions. I once read someone call this film ""a reader's movie,"" and I agree. It's pacing is slow, but rewarding, and you find yourself so wrapped up in it by the end that you can't look away.",The English Patient
167,MicheBel,Separating the Men from the Boys,9,13 January 1999,"This movie, almost more than any other, separates those who have a soul and can appreciate art from those who don't/can't. Usually, this falls along the lines of women loving it/men hating it. I'm not sure why this is exactly, but I've gotten into more fights over this movie.  I was swept up by the grandeur, the passion, the romantic settings. I believed it completely and loved nearly every moment of it. Many others snooze right through it. That, I don't understand at all. What no one can argue about is that it is visually stunning. Hey, I love Ralph (that's Rafe to you buddy) Fiennes, even in his burn casing thing.

There in that same desert, unknown to Rick and Louie, our Hungarian map maker in the employ of the British was busy selling the plans for the defense of Tobruk to Rommel's Panzer's so that -- let me see if I get this right -- he could get a used plane to fly into the desert and pick up the undoubtedly dead body of his lover, who just happened to be someone else's wife. No shooting the Gestapo colonel, no ""Round up the usual suspects."" Instead, it's informing on an incomprehensively grand scale for personal pleasure. Lucky our hero wasn't in Eisenhower's headquarters to filch a copy of the plans for Overlord, or Rommel would have been in full force on Omaha, Juno and Utah Beaches, Private Ryan would have been lying dead in a French field, and our standard morning greeting in this country would be ""Sig Hiel"".

172,Humphreywashere,An Oscar aberration- rather laughable movie about a puerile extramarital affair,3,26 March 2017,"The extramarital affair of two rich pompous and pretentious people who indulge in their own delights whilst others fulfil their duty to the war on the frontline, is the centre to this story. They are an utterly boring pair, especially the English patient himself, who proudly proclaims ""I do not bargain (with the local market merchants)"" in a disdainful tone. They are a construct always speaking as if they are reciting pretentious poetry. The historical chronicles of Herodotus are referred to by the pair repeatedly as if to remind the viewer that these people are oh so learned. When playing spin the bottle with others singing funny songs and having fun around a campfire, the female protagonist (the only woman in the company of about 5 men) recites a boring story of Gyges lusting for Candaules and her nakedness. That's when we first glimpse her narcissism and flirtatious personality.The most preposterous part is when our poetic lovers are stranded in the desert due to a plane crash involving the grieving husband. As she is injured, and her husband lies dead, her besotted lover leaves her alone with a flashlight and her precious Herodotus in a cave in the middle of the desert and walks to get help. Yes, that's right. With an ankle fracture her fate is sealed when he leaves her alone, whilst he embarks on a 3 day journey through the desert to return with a car. He is unsuccessful (there is a war after all). After a substantial period of time, he returns to the cave. Her body would be either desiccated or bloated, yet she is shown as fresh as the moment he left her when he lifts her in his arms and puts her in a plane again. Taking off, he crashes again in the desert and is burned to near death, but taken by passing Arabs to a hospital (through the desert again). A nurse, abandons her duties to wounded soldiers to feed and administer morphine repeatedly to this one selfish man for a substantial period of time, and she is portrayed as an angel.This movie sentimentalises and romanticises war. The love story is puerile and gross. I think lovers of cinematography might like it.",The English Patient

In real life, the Count was a homosexual and a Nazi sympathizer, both of which make the story on screen even more absurd (if that's possible).

Don't be swayed from the nay-sayers or the ones who believe that it was just a bunch of hype.  There is a reason this film cleaned up at the Oscars despite it's lack of ""Hollywoodism.""

The breath taking cinematography, the haunting musical score, and the fine acting by Juliet Binoche, Kristin Scott Thomas, and Ralph Fiennes makes this an extraordinary film. However, the real credit for this masterpiece has to go to the Director and screenplay writer Anthony Minghela.  I read the book later, and found it to be horrible (I have had that experience with another Booker prize winner too). It is amazing that a movie based on that book could be that beautiful. It flows between the past and present with ease, and it is completely seamless. Although very long, I was never bored.

The movie is an overwhelming on warm emotions though they will be born out of grief and compassion.

178,deltajvliet,The English Patient (1996),7,10 October 2008,"Though the plane crash at the start was a great opening and very enthralling, I couldn't say the same of the next hour or so. I was thoroughly bored for about the first 90 minutes of the movie, so much so that it took me three separate viewings to get to the 90 minute mark. However, once things kick into high gear (well, not really, but compared to the first half of the movie), I was enthralled. From David's unfortunate fate in the torture room to Clifton's death wish vengefulness to Katherine's ultimate fate, the movie really drew me in. And Ralph Fiennes proves yet again he is one of the best actors working today, and likely one of the best in cinematic history. I try not to use hyperbole, but I think it's justified here. The movie evoked memories of a number of great films, movies like Lawrence of Arabia and Raiders of the Lost Ark. It too achieved the epicness we often associate with them. And while I'm not sure it deserved the nine Oscars it won, well, it probably deserved a few. The first half was painfully slow, but the end makes up for it. And then some.

Her face does it all, and more. As the film flickers to her final goodbyes...the heart stops. You don't want the war, the sadness, the terror to end. Because with it will go the inspiration of a nurse who fought so hard to keep others alive, but had those closest to her die.

I have to say that the grandeur of John Seale's Oscar winning pictures were breathtaking from beginning to end. The story is well told although there are a few unlikely events. Ralph Fiennes' character being arrogant and pompous, it seems a bit improbable that Kristin Scott Thomas' character should fall for him so quickly. She, however, is to die for.

This film is all about this and more. Indeed is a slow paced movie, indeed the characters are not so great, but even the real life is not perfect, so let's put aside all this, and enjoy it with an open minded. Romance is something that appeals a lot to filmmakers, but again, few of them manage to capture it so nice on the screen. The actors were just amazing, the score is captivating and the cinematography reminds of Antonioni. If you are `impatient' this movie is not for you, but all the rest should be able to understand this movie and appreciate it.I watch it 3 times so far, and every time I discover new things that where not there beforeGrab a bottle of nice wine, turn off the light, and let the magic of this movie surround you I give this one 9 of 10.",The English Patient

185,john-3109,Out for the Count,10,16 May 2006,"Anthony Minghella's (1996) film of Michael Ondaatje's novel which was first published in 1992 is set in North Africa and Italy during the Second World War.It spans the course of the war and the way it both disrupts and facilitates the haphazard relationships and experiences of the characters whose lives we follow as the story unfolds.It portrays the operation of many confused and troubled minds and like all war films tracks the discomforting effects of sudden and unpredictable life-changing events. But equally, it traces the erratic and unexpected efforts of the different characters to find small interludes of peace in the shattering and unhinging progress of the war as it moves incomprehensibly towards a conclusion.In writing the book, the author came to the story much as the viewer comes to the film. A little confused and not quite understanding what is going on. At all stages of the film, things happen which are unexpected and sudden, but whose effect is predictable and far-reaching.But this cannot be the life of the author himself - because he was not born until after the war, of which he writes, was over.And somehow this is the feeling that the film conveys. Rather like recollections from an actual childhood, which later come into focus the film takes us on an incredible journey which is overshadowed by the awakening recollections of the troubled individual from which it takes its title.This a great film that takes us into a dangerous, unbalanced world where ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances struggle to make sense of their shattered lives and to find something familiar in their unfamliar surroundings.",The English Patient
186,Susie-7,"Boring, boring, boring",2,21 March 1999,"I cannot believe this movie won best picture.  Yes, it has nice cinematography and the acting is good, but it was far too long (for what the telling of the story accomplished) and very, very boring.  I thought the story focused too much on the relationship between Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas- a relationship I found myself not caring about at all, partly because Kristin Scott Thomas' character was not very likable- and not enough time on the relationship between Juliette Binoche and Naveen Andrews- characters I did like and was interested in.  Someone told me that in the novel, this relationship is stressed more than it is in the movie.  I don't know why, then, it was not really shown in the movie- if this was a matter of keeping the time down or if it was because they were unsure how the public would react to a multi-racial relationship, because for some reason there are still a lot of people out there that have problems with interracial relationships.  I really hope this wasn't the reason, because that would mean that not only did this movie suck, the creators also lacked integrity.  Anyway, like I said, the movie was too long, yet it seemed to do nothing with this time.  There were far too many shots where we apparently were supposed to gush at the scenery, time which could have been spent on, say, the relationship between Binoche and Andrews, or one making Kristin Scott Thomas' character seem less shallow.I cannot understand how this movie got nominated for best picture, never mind how it won.  I don't remember every movie that came out in 1996, but the other nominated pictures were better by far, even if they were not amazing films themselves.  Jerry Maguire was not a spectacular film, but it was certainly better than The English Patient.  Hey, even Independence Day and The Rock were more deserving of Oscars, because they at least were not boring. Twister had nifty special effects, such that even with its nonexistent storyline, it was more entertaining. There are very few movies I have seen that are as boring as The English Patient.  The only reason I didn't leave is because I paid to see it, that and I kept expecting it to get better, because of its accolades.  Instead I wound up very disappointed. This movie reminded me of reading a textbook- tedious and hard to pay attention to, with only odd bits of interest.  If you're the kind of person who enjoys reading textbooks in your spare time, this movie is for you.

But he's not to my taste, not at all. I'm not able to appreciate his greatness, and I'm sorry to be so limited.  Given that, it's not surprising that I wondered if Minghella could make much of ""The English Patient."" Did he ever! Yes, there are many fine, better than fine, acting performances (Naveen Andrews, especially), astonishing cinematography. But Minghella worked the alchemy here, made a lively story, cut away much from what was already a fairly short work, more a novella than a novel -- and created what seemed like a vast saga, spanning centuries -- crossing continents -- and gave us a story of forgiveness, of the terrors and wonders of both hate and love, but most typically -- a story of humanity transcending nationality, again and again.

What I found out was a cinematic delight and should, I repeat 'should' always be watched with an open mind. If you are a religious, moral zealot, I am afraid this is not a film for you as you will fail to see the beauty of this cinematic masterpiece as you will keep on harping on the moral dilemmas this film creates. As I remember correctly before I watched this film I read the review in this site and was thoroughly disgusted by the views of that person who I quote said 'that the protagonists thoroughly deserved what they got'. When it comes to morality I agree with him but this is not the way to comment on a film of this magnificence. I must admit rarely have I seen such a wonderfully crafted film. I keep on hearing the background soundtrack in my subconscious. First and foremost this is a love story and yes it's an extramarital affair (moralists beware) but lets not keep focusing on that. Instead let's focus on how the story was told. It's an admixture of flashbacks and the present. Its set in the world war II and tells us the story of a survivor of a plane crash (Count Almazhy played wonderfully by Ralph Fiennes) who is looked after by an army nurse (Juliet Binoche) in war torn Italy just before the beginning of the end (defeat of the axis powers). The burn scarred patient very much in pain kept on remembering the torrid affair he had with an English woman Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas) shown in flashbacks set in pre-war Africa. The past and the present are interwoven so adroitly in the story that you're sort of transported in the story and get the feel of a first hand viewer. The locales in the desert and in Italy are beautiful and so are the characters. I am a romantic and am not ashamed to say I had tears after it ended. Watch it with someone you truly love. The movie starts and ends with the same shot of the desert where the sand dunes twist and curves like a woman's body and it was breathtaking. The sense of loss and grief was conveyed so overwhelmingly by the actors that it makes me wonder why god! Why do we have wars that destroys beauty and the most unforgivable of all, the destruction of Innocence. Anyway it deservedly won a bunch of Oscars and I will go hunting for other works of director Anthony Minghella.It kind of brings back the romanticism in the David Lean genre of films.It almost reminds me of 'Lawrence of Arabia' which was also based in the desert.Happy viewing folks.",The English Patient

I even know that it's pronounced Rafe. And despite being an American male, my tastes do not run to the I am a caricature of the ultimate male so overwhelming with testosterone that I must blow up things every five minutes and then have passionate sex with multiple women type of movie. I like dramas, I like foreign films. I also read reams of literature. My favorite movies are probably Solyaris and Lawrence of Arabia, a film which many people have compared TEP to.But I had problems with TEP. First off, comparing this to David Lean I believe to be absurd. Why? Because it has shots of the desert? There are no other possible comparisons in my view. Lawrence of Arabia was about a truly complex and interesting man, however glamorized he might be at times.But TEP had no characters worth caring for. It reminds me of a book by Don Delillo called Underworld. It's been hailed as a great American novel, but when I read it, the writing and obvious ability to use language were impressive at times, but I was not drawn into the book at all. The characters were self-centered and one-dimensional. I wouldn't care if the New York art house types in the book died and were boiled in their oil paints.I felt the same way about TEP. The characters were despicable. The tired immoralist in love with his ennui. Oh wow, I think I'll cry. I felt the film was pretentious and overbearing, another diseased child in the inbred line of film royalty, which was hailed as a masterpiece because the producers set out to make one and the critics told us that it was. As in Underworld, the ability to use the form well was evident, but form does not make a great film or novel.So, needless to say, I was rooting for deaths all round when TEP approached its end, as I felt that I might then have gotten some value for my money. Though this will make some people scream at me, I must lump TEP in with the group of Titanic, Braveheart, Elizabeth, and all such pseudo-epics which attempt to overwhelm you with their passion, but really turn out to be banal and pompous, too aware of their own striving for grandeur.",The English Patient
190,mkelly54,"A Devotion to the Emotions, Tragedy and Turbulence of World War II.",10,30 December 2017,"The most impressive aspect of The English Patient is its devotion to the emotions, turbulence and tragedy of the time, World War II. With the world turned upside down by a war and the end of Europe's royal class, viewers are taken on a visually stunning journey of love, betrayal, constant loss and the ever-so-slow passing of the central character, Count Laszlo de Almasy, brilliantly played by Ralph Fiennes. Many reviewers term this a ""reader's movie,"" and so it is. It's also a movie of the visual and musical arts, with scenes throughout the work stretching the bounds of fixed concepts. I often listen to the soundtrack by Gabriel Yared, with wide swaths of themes reveling in the adventures of archeologists in the Sahara and discoveries of Italian monastic art. Countering the classic themes are popular jazz and big band pieces from the 1930s and 40s, with de Almasy renowned for knowing the lyrics to every piece from the era. The characters throughout the story are classic, which weaves an enduring tableau of emotions, memories and the realization that as much as many view each era as different, there is always a sense of the retelling of stories, best stated with Casablanca's song, As Time Goes By. Lastly, there's a simple reason The English Patient earned nine Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director for Anthony Minghella: It's one of the best movies of all time.

191,lorraineesimpson,Perfection,10,23 May 2015,"A grand, sweeping romance with more than a passing nod to the great epics like Lawrence of Arabia and Dr Zhivago, this is without doubt one of the best films of all time and deserved every one of it's 9 Oscars plus numerous other awards. At the core of this film is the doomed love affair between Almasy and Katharine. Their relationship is totally believable, the dashingly handsome Fiennes and the luminously beautiful Kristen Scott Thomas have great on screen chemistry, perfectly conveying the exquisite pain and passion of falling in love with the wrong person. The sex scenes stay on the right side of erotic desire rather than the gratuitous groping which unfortunately tends to be the default position for movies nowadays. The acting is universally excellent and the casting is flawless with everyone perfectly suited to their roles. Dafoe is a fine actor who has made some dire movies, but his role as David Caravaggio suits him perfectly. Colin Firth gives an understated and poignant performance as the slightly bumbling but desperately nice husband. Juliette Binoche, believable in every part she plays, gives a charmingly earthy performance as the caring nurse.Wonderful cinematography produces a picture perfect backdrop bathed in a golden glow - the desert scenes in particular are a visual feast. Even the music is perfect.It's rare for me to watch a film more than once - I've seen this one at least twenty times.

194,Pelagia,"Beyond ""Emotion""...",7,20 June 2000,"This is a film that makes a clear effort to present some sort of ""Casablanca for the nineties"".  It borrows the setting of the North African desert in the late 30's, a point on the distant fringe of a landscape beginning to taste the wrath of Nazi Germany.  Also apparent is the forbidden attraction between a single, unattached man and a married, respectable woman.If there is any reason why so many movies, ranging from every genre, have been set in WWII, it is found somewhere in the metaphor of the outside turmoil, devastation, death, heartbreak, etc. in the grand scheme of the war as a reflection, or rather, an allusion to the same happenings occurring the the private personal lives of the characters.Now, this is all good and well if you are searching hard to create some sort of mood, but it was all to certain that the filmmakers relied just too heavily on the atmosphere of the setting, letting it drive the plot instead of having the film focus on the personal lives of the characters.The overall effect of the film is that is seems just too calculated, it reaches into a familiar routine that you may notice in many of the so called ""tear-jerker"" movies.  A horrible death here, a shocking suicide there, a forbidden this, an unabashedly sexual that.  And so on.  Watching the film, I felt bombarded by these various tricks and tactics that are used to make me ""feel"", to ""get emotionally involved"".Of course, I am human, and consequentially I will fall prey to this and feel ""touched"" at various points in the film.  But nonetheless the film lacks that certain, indescribable something that defines the great classic films, including 'Casablanca'.  It is some sort of spontaneity in the acting, something uplifting, a performance, perhaps even one line, that sums up the world into the vision of the characters, that makes us believe in them. Something real.  Something that produces more than just ""emotion"", but rather wonder (a word that needs no quotation marks).Isn't that what real romance is about?",The English Patient

202,almanjit25,An epic tale of doomed love and tragedy across the dunes. A masterpiece.,9,24 August 2013,"I re-watched The English Patient after a year and no wonder it is one of my favorite films of all time. An epic tale of tragic, doomed love taking place across the gorgeous setting of the Saharan dunes. Magnificently rendered in every aspect from great characterization and brilliant powerful acting to beautiful, gorgeous cinematography and a love story that is mesmerizing and heart breaking. A true romance, a classic romance.There are no words to describe this romantic epic except 'YOU NEED TO SEE IT FOR YOURSELF'.I shall try describing it to the best of my ability but there is simply no way to describe this grand scale soulful love story. Words escape me and that rarely is the case. That is how great this film is. No wonder it swept the Oscars in 1997(film released in 1996).The acting is superior in every aspect. Unbeatable. Ralph Fiennes is brilliant as always. Kristin Scott Thomas, sensational, beautiful and magnificent and so so emotional in the best ways possible. Juliette Binoche beautiful emotion, powerful and soulful. The supporting cast is perfect as well. You feel the emotions of the lead trio and are taken aback by their sheer prowess and perfection. The story is a sweeping romance so greatly rendered and so heart breaking and touching. Tear inducing and so emotion filled especially at it's shattering and powerful climax. Against the backdrop of the World War II, archeology and cartography, through Egypt and the beautiful Sahara and gorgeous Italy. Absorbing from the get go and so perfectly timed. Sad, beautiful, gripping, sensational, grand, magnificent and awe inspiring. Those adjectives best describe this masterpiece and more.Usually people who hate this film are either anti-romantics, people who hate a film that is capturing each second with emotion and so lovingly and longingly. This to some people will mean the film is slow though to me it is a gripping classic romance. Others say this film is to picturesque to be real. Not true. Those people are those who lack imagination or who is not well traveled. These people need spoon feeding and directness. Those are people who cannot savor grand passion so soulfully woven and capitalizing each second with romantic wonder. Some macho d-bags will no appreciate it since it will cripple their manhood and others who lack soul and heart and are empty inside will not see the emotional explosion and heartfelt powerhouse film that this picture is. These people are few and far between though. Most adore this film and for good reason. Critics went gaga over this film and i never agree with critics half the time though in this case they were spot on. What a PERFECT feat.

207,anthonyehler,Hearts of Fire,10,3 June 2014,"English PatientHearts of FireLaszlo Almasy (Fiennes), Hungarian aristocrat and respected explorer is part of the International Sand Club before World War II. During a desert exploration, he meets Katherine (Scott-Thomas), a whole-hearted adventurer, and falls in love – even though she is married to Geoffrey (Firth), a British patriot. When we first see Almasy, he is badly burnt in a plane crash. A self-sacrificing French-Canadian nurse, Hana (Binoche) takes him to a war-shredded monastery to live out his last weeks. Hana is joined at the villa by Kip (Andrews), a Sikh bomb-disposal expert and a bitter ex-spy turned thief and addict called Caravaggio (Dafoe). The patient's story, told in flashbacks, forms the nucleus of this sweeping romance.The English Patient is unusual in that both its main narrative and subplot are love stories informed by the displacement of war. The love affair between Almasy and Katherine is a classic triangle, a story of forbidden love against the tumult of changing history. Almasy says he doesn't like to possessed, but soon he is possessed by his need for Katherine: he becomes jealous, violent, mad. He says the heart is 'an organ of fire' – and he is consumed by a fire out of control. And Geoffrey's act of desperation is a catalyst for the film's final tragedy.On the other hand, Hana's love affair with Kip is far more naturalistic, tender and explorative. It explores beauty and trust. Ultimately, it is about healing, and cultures coming together. Whereas Almasy is betrayed by his Hungarian past by the suspicious English, Hana and Kip are examples of the hope for a multi-cultural world after the war. It is an idealistic statement to be sure, but a powerful one nonetheless.The script very cleverly brings Hana into Almasy's storyline by giving Katherine's poignant last letter to Almasy a voice, and giving her the power to release the burnt Almasy from his suffering. Hana is a wonderfully empathetic hinge between the two stories, between past and present. In this regard, she is probably the most important character in the film.Director Anthony Minghella has infused every frame of the movie with light and dark, colour and shadow. The stark gold of the North African desert is juxtaposed against the soft dappled green-and-blue summer of Italy. Two scenes stand out: Almasy and the team exploring the Cave of Swimmers against Hana and Kip exploring the Italian church. Both illuminate something hidden, hitherto unseen, mysterious and beautiful. Both become exquisite and lavish metaphors for the human condition. The light plays a part in delineating the two love stories. In the ACT II climax, Katherine is left alone in a cave with dying torch light as Almasy is dragged through a dark tunnel, a captive in a British Jeep: so symbolic of death.The film explores many themes on many levels. One that is the most powerful is the idea of personal history against landscape, biography, war – between one man's memory and another's idea of truth, romantic myth and appalling reality. Almasy's book is by Herodotus, the father of history. The idea of storytelling is a powerful thread through the film: from the campfire stories in the desert, to the folk song, to the letters and notes we find inside his well-worn book. In the end, Hana – the most hopeful, kind and idealistic character – carries this book and this part of history into the future.",The English Patient

Well, it may be sappy, but it is beautiful also. And for those who argue it is too long (260mins) may just need to stop complaining.

That's what I give this really dull film about some very self-centered and self-serving characters. And why a 5? Because it was well filmed and well acted. But the story was totally out of some writer's imagination, loosely based on true events in pre-WWII Africa. When it got to the point that Count Almasy traded maps of northern Africa to the Germans for an airplane to recover his lover's corpse, I just sat there saying, ""Sheesh...he was a () traitor!"" over and over to myself in near disbelief. He didn't have much hero status to begin with, but that totally killed it for me. Then in the special features, we are told by a history professor that the real Count was actually on Rommel's staff.

No wonder that Andrew Lloyd Webber's acceptance speech for ""Evita"" at that year's Oscars began ""Well, thank God that ""The English Patient"" had no songs in it."" Writing of Oscar winners takes me to Juliette Binoche, who, in a stellar cast, gives a beautiful performance. It is heartening to see that the dynamics which seem to influence the award for Best Actor (often going to showy pyrotechnic display) aren't at work in the female categories. Just as Emma Thompson's hugely well-deserved Oscar for her portrayal of Margaret Schlegel in ""Howard's End"" proved that one of the hardest things that an actor can do is make the portrayal of ""goodness"" involving, so Binoche's win proved that it could be that - and seriously sexy.

219,wisDOM87,"You don't have to be English to watch this film, but you sure have to be patient",5,16 January 2021,"I went into this with pretty low expectations. It's not the sort of thing I usually watch; I've been working my way through various 'best films ever' lists and this one kept cropping up.This is basically a 90s version of one those overly-long 50s melodramas you might find bulking out the schedule on a Sunday afternoon, spiced up with some exotic scenery and softcore sex. The main part of the story focuses on an affair between characters portrayed by Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas. To be frank I was never convinced by their supposedly irresistible attraction, which apparently begins during an eventful desert journey in which Fiennes acts as a standoffish intellectual type and Scott as a bumptious rich girl out for a jolly in the colonies. As there's not much chemistry between the two actors the main pillar of the plot is pretty flaccid. Much of this story is told in flashback, as Fiennes is nursed in an Italian villa having suffered severe burns in a plane crash. There are a couple of subplots - one mildly diverting involving the nurse (Juliette Binoche) and her romantic intrigue with a Sikh sapper (Naveen Andrews), another an uninvolving and tension-less one focussing on the Willem Defoe character and espionage.This isn't a bad film by any means. It's just a rather dull one - bloated, and not terribly involving, though not to such an extreme extent that I felt like turning it off. The film is set in WW2, which crops up as a inconvenient annoyance which gets in the way of the real action, which is the love affairs and romantic intrigues of the upper class. It's set in Italy and Tunisia, which of course offers room for some suitably epic scenery - some wonderful shots of the desert. As with those old 50s films the locals are merely colourful parts of the scenery along with the flora and fauna. There are some individual scenes which stick in the mind - the discovery of the cave paintings, the church bungee jump, Fiennes drunken dinner party tirade, the torture scene, the bomb defusing. But ultimately it was a rather tedious watch and not one I'll be revisiting. Very over-rated, though might suit the Mills & Boon set.",The English Patient

223,movieandtvfanatic,Certain great points but....BORING!!,5,12 October 2007,"The cinematography was excellent and the acting (mainly Juliette Binoche) was very good but this movie holds the record of being the ONLY movie I ever fell asleep during.The English Patient has its supporters and haters evenly divided and I am obviously more of a hater than a supporter. I remember being so glad to see the Seinfeld episode where Elaine stood up and actually said ""That movie stunk!"".I personally find it sad that this film swept the Oscars when the much more superior Fargo and Secrets & Lies were among the nominees.However, I will say that I can support the Binoche and Cinematography wins but everything else....uh....NO I CAN'T!! Here is another example of the Academy going for the big, overblown epic (and Miramax probably bought it) and it is one of the worst BP choices ever!!",The English Patient
224,cacikra,The gold standard,10,3 March 2001,"It's a rather late date to be commenting on The English Patient, but here goes . . . This film inspires in me the kind of blind admiration I usually loathe.  I find I can respectfully disagree with someone about any film but this.  Some unreasonable part of me rejects as an idiot anyone who doesn't like this movie (painful when it involves family members, but there you are); obviously I'm not alone in this, as the Seinfeld episode makes clear: it is the kind of thing you break up with someone over (luckily my husband loved it, too). OK, this is a bit of an exaggeration, but not by much.  It is the sheer artistic cohesiveness and depth of it. Every element is amazing: the screenplay (of a nearly impossible-to-follow novel), the directing, the acting, the cinematography, the score . . . nothing is as it seems, which is just the point. I never watch it without seeing some new detail which both echoes and elaborates on one of the many themes and images which are so intricately wound throughout.  It is that rarest of film achievement: a work of art.  I judge every subsequent film by how it compares to the overall achievement of The English Patient; no winners so far.  The critic for The New Yorker at the time of the film's release(not sure if it was David Denby or Anthony Lane) summed up my feeling exactly: a masterpiece.",The English Patient
225,CrazyRaccoon777,A masterpiece - made by a genius with mesmeric acting,10,18 June 2011,"I believe from experience this movie really needs to be seen more than once - in order to fully appreciate it.The first time for me it seemed a bit slow and dis-jointed.This has now become my favourite movie of all time.It is beautifully filmed and acted with mesmeric passion which is palpable.Many of the scenes and quotes are memorable but i don't want to give too many spoilers in case anyone has not seen the movie yet.The sound-track is amazing too with haunting music to complement and affirm the beautiful cinematography you are watching on screenThe film demonstrates that no amount of vows taken or attempted resistance can control passion and lust when the occasion and opportunity arise. Passion is not under control but rather controls and consumes.This film ultimately succeeds in making adultery look divine - Or more specifically the Love which develops from the affair looks Divine.It is an amazingly beautiful tragedy and will affect you deeply. For those who have themselves been intensely in love at some point - watching this movie will be an experience not just an event.Much kudos to the late, great Anthony Minghella.This film won 9 Oscars but i believe should have had 3 more for the lead roles of Ralph Fiennes and Kristen Scott Thomas and also for Minghella's screenplay which did not win but were all nominated.",The English Patient
226,Seikan,The Best Of All Best Picture Winners For Reasons Hidden In Their Poetic Triumphs...,10,23 April 2006,"In a critical scene, as Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas) lies in the Cave Of Swimmers, she writes something read aloud by Hana (Juliette Binoche) in which she proclaims that ""the light has gone out now, and I'm writing in the darkness..."" A sentence of such poetic beauty could not be more perfect for the cinematic brilliance of the far from tiresome The English Patient. With such a dramatic sweep that keeps one firmly on their feet, and a strength about the film that doesn't let up, this film proudly celebrates the mysteries and romances of World War II, taking elements of Casablanca and Lawrence Of Arabia along with some independence in the form of Tuscany.The English Patient unabashedly pulls the heartstrings and takes us through a mysterious first act, a romantic second act, and a beautiful... beautiful final act, and it isn't just the wonderful pace and setting, it's the performance of Ralph Fiennes, who keeps us sympathetic even when Count Almásy, from the very start, proves to be a thoroughly unlikable character. Usually typecast as a villain, he shows tainted, but ultimately human colours as a man taken in by a desperate love that he must fulfill.Many will criticize this film based on its so called ""glorification of adulterers"", but those who do know nothing. The contrasts between the two periods (before and after the plane crash seen at the start) are spectacular, as the patient is the regretting man who suffers because of what he did, the evil that was once in him now absent, whereas the man of before the crash is an individual like anyone else. He wants this woman but he cannot have her, Fiennes brings the human-like qualities out of Almásy in a way absolutely NO OTHER actor could. There couldn't have been a better actor for the job.So please, take these comments to heart, see the film, those who call it ""boring"" or ""despicable"" know nothing, and should be ashamed of such a one-dimensional view on the film, a view that they have neither studied nor corrected, and probably don't plan on correcting. The English Patient is the best of every film to have ever won the Best Picture Oscar, and for so many reasons, hidden in their poetic triumphs.",The English Patient
227,Reel_World,A worthy addition to the Best Picture list,10,29 June 2004,"After browsing through numerous reviews from guys who wouldn't know a great movie if it came up and slapped them (and from reading their reviews I am guessing their idea of a perfect movie would be Gator Bait III) I feel compelled to put my two cents worth in on this film. The 1996 Oscars were important, in that for the following two years, the Academy ignored what should have won Best Picture in 97 and 98 - so the win by The English Patient was proof that Hollywood at that point could still recognize great film making when they saw it.The movie had some of the best music, cinematography, and acting with sublime direction by Minghella that brought out the true essence of what Ondjaate was trying to convey in the novel. For people to complain that the film was overly long is ludicrous. Clocking in at just under 2hrs 45, this film is shorter than Harry Potter 1, Dances with Wolves, Titanic, and others, and in the time allotted on screen, it manages to evoke an emotional reaction from its audience that most other movies of its genre strive to do, but ultimately fail. The evolution of the character arcs, especially Almasy and Katherine is incredible *SPOILER WARNING* culminating in him finally admitting his love for her as he carries her to the caves *SPOILER OVER* That scene ALWAYS makes me cry for some reason....Probably the sheer tragedy of the situation wherein they both know there is no future for them, but that the emotion and affection they both subconsciously knew was there was finally realized.Overall, a brilliant piece of film, and a movie that should be on any true movie lover's DVD shelf. Of course, if you're in the minority of the people on this board who don't like ""Chick Flicks"" or ""Long and boring movies"" then you should probably avoid this. If you, like myself, enjoy a masterfully directed piece of cinema that doesn't rely on heavy CGI, explosions, gunfire, foul language and frat parties, then if you haven't had a chance to see The English Patient, I would recommend renting a copy of the newly released Collector's Edition DVD and see what all the fuss is about.",The English Patient

The ending surprised me and was touching.Recommended.",The English Patient
229,morgandorfer61,Wonderful movie...,5,11 August 2000,"...to sleep to. Even though I absolutely hated this movie it does have a few good things about it.1) Excellent music - I personally believe Marta Sebestyn has a beautiful voice.2) The scenes shot in the desert were beautiful (but overdone)3) One of my favorite actors, Ralph Fiennes, is in it (but I do forgive him for that)But even though those things were good, I hate this film with a passion and I give kudos to the Seinfeld episode where Elaine doesn't understand why people love this movie. And like the character Elaine, I do not understand why people and The Academy Awards liked this movie.1) Juliette Binoche's character was very bland to me and her dialogue seemed unrealistic. 2) The beginning needs a lot more coal in the fire. With all the energy in it, you might tune out before the real action hits. And even then the action is next to nothing.3) I don't feel any passion or love between Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas. Their ""love"" scenes are more comedic than passionate. Couldn't they kiss like normal human beings??4) I never feel that Colin Firth is a jealous husband until the very end.5) And the line ""You can't kill me. I died long ago."" didn't make sense to me. Wouldn't that mean his love for Katherine was nothing? He was dead during that relationship? Wow. What a powerful love story.6) Isn't the movie ""Fargo"" on the top 100 movies of all time? So why didn't it win the Academy Award for Best Picture? Maybe it wasn't commercial enough.So don't waste practically 3 hours of your time with this movie. Not unless you want an almost 3 hour nap. If you want to see Fiennes as a cynical lover see ""The End of the Affair"". An excellent movie with all the good things about the ""The English Patient"" with an exception of the desert. If you want to see the REAL best movie of 1996 see ""Fargo"". And if you want to see a good movie directed by Anthony Minghella see ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" (even though its adaptation was far from faithful to the book.) Or you could watch a slug race because it has the same pace of ""The English Patient"" and just about as much excitement.",The English Patient
230,rdconger,Balderdash,1,9 March 2003,"I am not surprised to find user comments for this film full of gushy nonsense, such as that this film ""[proves] that when it is predestined, love will find a way.""  I begin in this way, not to criticize a specific reviewer, but because this citation so typifies the hyperbolic, uncritical treacle that was poured out over this film, even before it hit the theaters. Even the best of films do not ""prove"" anything, nor are they intended to. The best films entertain and move the viewer, and ""The English Patient"" fails on both criteria.I remember the studio's promotion of ""The English Patient"" very clearly: ""From the producers of 'Amadeus' and 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,'"" it grandly announced.  An ignorant or careless listener might miss the crucial word, ""producers,"" in this disingenuous statement and mistakenly associate the director of ""The English Patient,"" so very inappropriately, with the truly great director, Milos Forman.  Such a comparison is offensive to the memory of Mr. Forman.While the novel by Michael Ondaatje upon which the film was based, is a good one, it is unfortunate that the film failed to capture any quality of the book in any way whatsoever.  Aside from plot elements that seem only coincidentally similar, the film bears little resemblance to the novel.
Despite misgivings which began when I heard that shamelessly misleading promotion, I went to see this film in the theater.  As it began to unfold, I realized that the rendering of the novel's peculiar magic had failed, that the actors knew their words but not their characters, and that their characters were flat, dull, and unengaging.  The film was a complete travesty of Ondaatje's novel and a completely still-born cinematic artifact of the worst description.Those who gush over this film are very apt to speak with adjectives like, ""sweeping,"" and ""grand,"" and ""hypnotic.""  Well, it is none of those.  In fact, not even Ondaatje's fine novel could be described as ""sweeping"" or ""grand.""  It could be described as ""magical"" and ""hypnotic"" -- yet these are precisely the qualities that the film so utterly failed to deliver.  It is almost as if Minghella had, as a reader, entirely missed what was valuable in the novel and could grind out on celluloid only a pale, skeletal version, a version that not only missed the spirit of the story, but that focused on the wrong characters.  He produced a filmic transliteration that not only had no respect for story's metaphors but no apparent cognizance of them, as well.Minghella took the central focus away from Hana and Kip and put it on the Patient and Katherine Clifton, thereby missing the narrative trail of the novel as well as the ""essence"" of it.Ralph Fiennes and Kristen Scott Thomas put in unengaging, uninspiring, uninvolving, unemotional performances that were obviously intended to convey a great, driving, passionate love-affair to the viewer, but which in fact delivered only an inexplicable, perfunctory liaison between two flat, shallow, uninteresting adulterers.  Both actors are physically and emotionally inadequate and unexciting, and neither performance provided the viewer with the great emotional response obviously intended by Minghella's grandiose and overblown presentation.The ""grand, sweeping, David-Lean-like"" qualities to which the many undiscriminating reviewers of this goofy film love to refer simply is not there. The comparison to David Lean (""Dr. Zhivago"") is positively insulting to yet another great director.  Take, for example, the ""Patient's"" sandstorm scene, which is no doubt one wherein these ""grand, sweeping"" qualities are believed to have resided (or should have resided): the sandstorm is not grand -- it is not even convincing.  The subsequent burying of the characters in the automobile and their emergence after the storm, which no doubt was supposed to affect the viewer dramatically and emotionally, completely lacked either drama or emotion --in fact, because it was so patently weak, it had an air of comedy about it where comedy was clearly out of place.This film failed.  It failed as a rendering of the novel, and it failed as a film.  It seems to have been the ""anointed Oscar vehicle"" of the year (joining such over-trumpeted filmic slosh as ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" or ""Terms of Endearment"").  One can only thank God that even the hype-driven Acadamyhad the good sense to present the Best Actress award to Frances McDormand for her truly deserving performance in the truly excellent film, ""Fargo."" There was not a single performance in the execrable ""English Patient"" that was not either embarrassingly horrid over-acting (Willem Dafoe) or truly forgettable, mediocre acting (Fiennes and Scott Thomas).
Why this non-entity of a film retains a coven of fanatical (and clearly tasteless) devotees will remain a mystery.  Fortunately, the sands of time will bury this mediocrity of a film permanently, and it will not, thankfully, have the strength ever to dig itself out.",The English Patient

232,TheMaster01,A Poetic Masterpiece,9,4 February 2015,"Love in the present, Love in the past; ""The English Patient"" is a love story through and through, and one of the best I might add. In a year of tornadoes twisting, aliens arriving, schoolgirls screaming and Cuba Gooding Jr. creating catchphrases; The English Patient soared high as an epic that was definitely deserving of its win. I know that this is not an opinion which is universally agreed upon (Leigh's ""Secrets & Lies"" has a heavy following, as does the Coen's ""Fargo"") but 'The English Patient' has all of the ingredients of a gorgeous and enchanting epic, a film which deserves to be respected. Based on the 1992 novel of the same name (written by Michael Ondaatje), the film dips back and forth between past and present with one man at the centre of it all: the English Patient. In the present he is a patient, badly burnt due to a plane crash and cared to by a young war nurse in an Old Italian Villa. These are the final days of the Second World War. Our protagonist (although it's initially difficult to tell) is portrayed by Ralph Fiennes, who after a stellar performance in Schindler's List, continued to push out another terrific role as Count Laszlo de Almasy. Fiennes is superb in the portrayal of a man whose history is a mystery, and whose current charred state has aided in turning him into a blank slate. Slowly, but surely, he begins to remember events from his past. It's a performance of great dynamics, intelligence and passion. Caring for him is Hana, a twenty-something-year-old nurse played by Juliette Binoche, and she is someone to marvel at in this outstanding and affecting performance. Between finding love in a Sapper named Kip (Naveen Andrews) and tending to her English Patient (technically Hungarian by Birth), Binoche unveils the layers of a quiet yet complex character. An independent yet still frightened woman, Binoche is to die for. There is one other member that arrives at the Villa: David Caravaggio (cunningly portrayed by Willem Dafoe) a thief missing both of his thumbs, who initially is there to pinch a bit of morphine, before realising who the English Patient actually is But as I said, this tale dips between past and present. I've discussed the present enough, so let's jump deeper into the tale. Set in the 1930's, Fiennes is no longer disfigured. He's a co-leader of an archaeological surveying expedition in the African Desert. It is in this time of the story where we meet Katherine and Geoffrey Clifton, a pair of Married British explorers. Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas in her best on-screen performance to date) is the catalyst that sets the story's love affair right off. ""She's Charming and she's read everything"". Count Almasy is mesmerized (for lack of a better word) by Katherine and descends into a love affair that has strong consequences upon both of them. Fiennes and Scott Thomas share some of the best on-screen chemistry in 90's cinema not only in their erotic and sumptuous love scenes, but also the moments when she is still in the presence of her husband George (a fine performance by Colin Firth). You could cut the romantic-friction with a blade. Of course, Firth begins to piece things together and trouble ensues. The relationship between these two contrasts nicely with that of Hana and Kip in the present timeline. One of gentle passion, against the heavy intensity of the affair.The film is gorgeously shot by John Seale, who deservingly won the Oscar for Best Cinematography. Sand hadn't looked this good since ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and few films of its time could have managed to match the beauty and scope that Seale and director, Anthony Minghella had achieved. Just watch the opening scene as its focused beauty unfolds: Flying across the desert landscape, the shadow of a biplane, glides in and out of frame and the pull-back of the camera reveals a man and woman flying inside. This scene alone (aside from being beautifully shot) sets up the film's story, in the sense that, all of the films events seemingly lead up, and are a result of, what is viewed in this moment. The film will later go on to reveal who these figures are, and why this is significant. Minghella's non- linear timeline may confuse viewers at first, but don't for a moment think that he doesn't know what he is doing. As the plane is shot down, your curiosity and excitement will be awakened. Aside from directing the film, Minghella also adapted Ondaatje's novel (not butchered, adapted). It's a story of War, Love, Passion, Sin; and told through a vivid and beautiful poetic structure. As said before, Minghella dives between past and present through the use of flashbacks beautifully, and hats off to Walter Murch's smooth editing, piecing these two strands together like a perfect puzzle. So many points in this film are hard hitting and test the viewer emotionally. But having said that, it's not all tragic. Binoche shares numerous scenes with Naveen Andrews which, yes, ultimately comes to an inevitably sad end, but watch as the two of them swing around the roof of an old church, admiring the paintings to the sound of Gabriel Yared's poetic score. In the midst of tragedy, silver linings can still be found. A love that Hana thought died within her years ago has been rekindled. It's moments like this that restore one's faith in humanity, that make you smile during a film that has conveyed sorrow. That's powerful cinema if you ask me. The English Patient is a beautiful film, it's the romantic epic that ""Gone with the Wind"" wishes it could be (that's right, I went there). The Ensemble cast is brilliant, and Minghella tells such a great story with a bold and fascinating vision. Screw the haters; ""The English Patient"" is one of the finest war-come-romance films ever made.",The English Patient

The manner in which the stories intertwine is very unique in modern cinema.  The nuances in what exactly is going on in the characters' heads are subtle, and the way in which Binoche and Fiennes intereact is mesmerizing, as well, of course, as Fiennes and Kristen Scott Thomas's exploits as the adulterous couple.  The build-up to the affair is well done, with foreshadowing such as the campfire myth.  The cinematography is drop-dead gorgeous, obviously.  For me there just isn't anything to complain about in this film, which is saying a lot giving how critical I am of films.  For those of you who are bored by the film, I suggest you stick to either action flicks or romantic comedies...something tells me you have trouble focusing on anything that requires any thought.  And for those of you shrug this movie off as just another drama receiving too many accolades, I suggest you watch the film again.  If you're paying attention to it, there are lots of subtle shifts in the characters' interactions/mannerisms that you might not catch if you don't realize what's going on.

The acting is good.  No one can deny that, but all the good acting in the world couldn't save this movie. There are essentially four stories going on at any time during the movie: the flashbacks of a dying man, his relationship with the woman who is caring for him, a nurse's attempt to love someone without them dying, and a man with no thumbs looking to get revenge for what happened to him.  There is just too much going on in this movie.  None of the stories are ever resolved very well.  It is almost as if the director was just getting into the movie when he realized that it was already over three hours long and tried to wrap everything up very quickly.  The only real romance in the film comes in the form of flashbacks to an almost comical affair between Ralf Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas.  The first love scene, which is supposed to be one of those angry/passionate sex scenes, ends up looking like a botched up rape. The nudity is almost tacky and lacks any artistic value.

I am the firm believer that romance movies can't be about three hours long. I know, this film is about two hours and 40 minutes, it felt like seven hours. It isn't entertaining, it's depressing. This movie is a three hour sappy love story and it is brutally boring. Know the film is shot well and the acting isn't bad, it was just chicle and not inserting. I don't want to write a long review for this so just know, if you watch this movie it is a commitment even if you watch it in multiple sittings on multiple days it feels like the longest experience in my entire life. If you absolutely love romance movies you'll like The English Patient, but if your like me and you want to be invested and care about the characters then don't watch this movie. Life is short and this movie feels like it takes a huge part of your life away.",The English Patient
250,cmiller-38,loyal to self,2,6 December 2005,This film tried to make two romantic films in one. It was way to long. The part between Kip and Hana was unneeded. We see selfish love between the Count and Katherine. They were loyal only to their own desires-Katherine heeding not her marriage vows (even though she is plagued with guilt)and the Count committing fornication and showing his obsession with 'K' at the dance party where it looks like he was seriously going to do some physical harm and threatened her for being with others. They both should have been buried in the sandstorm before their passions got out of control. Why glorify animal lust and call it love when they were only together for a short expedition. The adventures in the desert were much more interesting such as the Swimmer's Cave. Why was the druggie thrown into the mix as well? Is he the villain to fear the whole film? There was some interesting World War history with the mines and torture room but other than that I wish the Count's book was burned and I did not waste my time on this film. I'm sure Hana the nurse had a more interesting past instead of a map making guy who was burned all over. Hana commits murder at the end and then smiles at a little girl in the truck. I wouldn't want her near my child. This film shows the sickness of society. Also the lead expedition man kills himself. I only gave it a two because of my interest in the Egyptian culture and scenery.,The English Patient

257,pyrpaul1616,Is there a more dramatic theatre for love than war? A more sweeping scene for memories lost than the desert?,9,13 December 2019,"Is there a thing more beautiful than a broad story of depth given its due time to develop?Some may say this movie is too slow and I can only disagree. Over 2hrs 40min this epic slowly unfurls, revealing to us the intricate histories of a swath of characters expertly portrayed. The relationship between Thomas and Fiennes is intense, highly involved, and utterly believable. Juliette Binoche's crisp performance of Hana is layered with a youth and naivety. And the leering and shady Caravaggio was played by Dafoe lends an edge to the story that helps propel the narrative.Rare is its that a movie succeeds in capturing a place, a time and the raw and untranslated emotions of such a diverse palate of characters. But it must be said, this is not a thrilling adventure movie, nor a electrifying tale of spies ladened with plot twists and turns, but a slow exploration of human character, and the relationships that grow between people, despite their surrounds and origins. War is present, but it's ever in the background, as much as the desert is, or the green hills above Florence, where Hana sets up her impromptu hospice.Ralph Fiennes is a wonder, maybe even witnessed here in the performance of his career as he plays what is ultimately two roles: the spirited and driven Almasy, at his prime and in his comfort in the solitary confines of North Africa, and the English Patient, withered and injured as he lays, accepting death and musing in his last hours of the love he once felt.For fans of he book this movie pales in comparison, but that only goes to show the mastery of Ondaatje's writing. The characters appear as washed out versions of themselves, with the role of Hana proving to be most removed from her literary self. Soft changes to the history and build up of the story also prove subtle alterations to the relationship between characters.But that is not to take away from the wonder of this movie. Winner of 9 occurs and nominated for a further three, this is a film that will remain a classic in the years to come. A movie that is an utter joy to watch for the first time, and has that uncommon touch of magic that can be relived again and again over future viewings.",The English Patient
258,trojanrabbit97,Pleasantly Surprised,8,11 March 2001,"My biggest film-buff friends didn't like this movie, so it took me nearly five years to get around to seeing it.  I'm very glad that I finally did see it.  Expert cinematography, carefully-handled subplots, and rock-solid acting make this film a cinematic masterpiece.The movie is slow, but I didn't find it boring.  This is basically a frame story told in flashbacks.  Be careful when watching this movie to note the dates of the various flashbacks, because they're not all in sequential order; however, I found that they were masterfully interwoven.The primary love story didn't really pull at my heartstrings at first, but I frequently have to make an effort to set aside personal judgmentalism for a story about an adulterous relationship.  It's easier for me when the betrayed spouse is blatantly evil or a big jerk, like Lord Wessex of ""Shakespeare in Love"" (Poor Firth... his female's always falling for a Fiennes) or the Thief of ""The Cook, The Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover."" While Clifton may not have been a perfect husband, he genuinely loved his wife.  Near the end of the movie, when Almasy and Katherine go back to the cave, (I'm trying to avoid a spoiler here) is when their love story really seizes my heart.  It was around this point in the film that I began to realize what all the hype was about and see the genius of this film.  I think the last 30 to 45 minutes are the best part of the movie and well worth the wait. This film was definitely worthy of its 1996 Best Picture nomination.  Did it deserve to win?  I haven't seen its competitors recently enough to offer an informed opinion, but I don't think the '96 Oscars upset the order and balance of the universe.",The English Patient
259,ciocc1001,Where's the story?,3,4 July 2003,"Spoiler alert: This movie is like a picture of a desert. In a sandstorm. Made into a jigsaw puzzle. There is no story, at least not enough of one to hold your attention for more than five or 10 minutes.

260,small_aubergene,9 Oscars?!,5,20 September 2005,"This film is very much like the Aviator. Not much explanation and not much else really. It is probably one of the slowest films you'll ever watch. You'll keep checking what the time is as you're going through it. It's a film almost completely devoid of entertainment, which should have been replaced with emotion (the sort you get a la Sean Penn), but alas not. What you get instead is a film which has a few moments of inspiration, but then descends back into the dusty hands of the scenic settings. A couple of the characters are likable, which is one of the good things that hold the whole thing together. However, our main couple - the Count and (flip, I can't remember her name) the American woman - are not at all likable. They come across as being shallow, vindictive little creatures and this would all be fine and dandy, but there's no reason to support why these people are like this. Much of their intimate acting is seriously hammed up and some moments are unintentionally laughable. The real heroes are Kip and Hana, though the scene in the church is a bit of pure cheese. They make a sweet couple and its reasonably saddening when they have to say goodbye. Juliette Binoche and Naveen Andrews should have got the congrats at the Oscars, but alas the Oscars has been a sham for many years (two words: Johnny Depp). The film also shows that Binoche should be the holder of the Fighting With Inanimate Objects award.",The English Patient
261,Mudsharkbytes,"Can't believe this beat both ""Sling Blade"" AND ""Fargo"" for best picture!",2,29 June 2005,"Two of my very favorite movies were released in 1996, ""Sling Blade"" and ""Fargo"".When ""The English Patient"" won the Oscar for best picture, my expectations were naturally very high, I mean, the academy selected it over two of the most transcendental movies I had ever had the pleasure to experience.To say I was disappointed would be an understatement.Unlike many others here, I have no real complaints about the length of the move, and, I agree that the cinematography is beautiful. Really eye-candy there.But I had no sympathy for either of the main characters. Why should I? By their own actions they brought on their own destruction, and, worse, the destruction of others who trusted them.When Ralph Fiennes stumbles out of that cave at the end, blubbering like a baby, I knew I was SUPPOSED to empathize with him, but I only felt he got what he deserved.I'm not normally a 'moralist', but I had to wonder why the academy would pass over two movies that had highly moral characters attempting to defend the innocent and defenseless for a movie that glorified immoral people experiencing instant karma while ruining the lives of other innocent people. I guess Hollywood is trying to tell us, hey, if you get the serious hots for someone, it's okay to have an affair.If you want to see a movie with characters you can believe in and empathize with, watch ""Sling Blade"". If you want to see a movie you can watch over and over and continue to find new twists & turns, watch ""Fargo"".If you want to watch a beautifully filmed grade B soap-opera, watch ""The English Patient""I give it 2/10 for beautiful cinematography.",The English Patient
262,ngc137,Disappointing - and not worth its academy awards,6,13 March 2005,"Not only judging from the numerous Oscar awards (which I experienced to be sometimes misleading earlier) but also from the emphatic praises of some independent critics, I placed high expectations on this movie: It promised to present an intense, epic story on the a historical background of world war II, a story that centers around a passionate love, touching the viewer with the depth of a tragic romance. But what a disappointment! The movie is flawed in so many ways. The slow pace that is criticized by a lot of viewers is not part of the problem itself. It would have been appropriate for this kind of story if the script writer and the director had explored the characters and their motivations more deeply and more convincingly. Unfortunately the movie remains on the surface. Moreover,the way that many elements of the plot come in makes them unbelievable, as if they were constructed only to support the overall story line.The worst of all is - from my point of view - that the movie is unable to present the central romance between Laszlo and Katharine as anything deeper than an affair which is based on simple erotic attraction only. If it were meant in this way, I had no problem with it: Affairs that remain on this level are probably frequent in reality. However this movie tries hard to convince us of more. And it fails miserably.It looks as if the film makers took some ingredients to produce a romantic atmosphere (diaries, candle lights, sunsets etc.) from an average TV soap, mixed everything together and hoped to come out with a romance in this simple way. Proceeding in this way, the potential of the story for many highly dramatic moments was thrown away. There is at least one scene that would have made me cry in the context of a true drama. However watching ""The English Patient"" my mind was mostly dominated by the fact that everything I saw was only acting and a bit too obviously contrived.If the script had been better, other flaws of the movie were not so important: Although much of the story presents to us people that come together at the end of a war and, during the flashbacks, we are are supposed to see people that have spent many days on an expedition in the sandy desert, everybody looks neat and clean. A convoy of new cars with soldiers in new clothes drives along the road. Badly injured soldiers seem as if they came not from the battle field, but directly from the hairdresser. Artificial light is used too often for the sake of an evenly illuminated, but unnatural picture.All in all, this movie is much overrated. However, it is not unwatchable or insultingly stupid. In spite of the aforementioned flaws, I enjoyed it still enough to give it 6 out of 10 stars.",The English Patient

Seriously, after seeing this I want to vacation in the desert.Before I get into this, I must admit I haven't read the book which this is based on, so maybe that's why I didn't get it. With that being said, I found this movie to be pretentious. Why on earth am I supposed to care about the lives of snobby rich people? They have these supposedly grand statements about love, lines which only served the purpose of making them look shallow. Hana and Kip seemed like side characters, I think they might've been more interesting as leads.Finally, this movie goes on for way too long.

The final cave scene still breaks my heart. A more powerful message of the futility of war than a hundred bloodfests. One of the few occasions when the American Academy got it spot-on.It is amusing, and not a little sad, to read other reviews here and see words such as 'boring' and 'overlong' sprinkled throughout. It seems we really have produced a 'fast-food' generation without the concentration or intelligence to sit through and appreciate something with a little more substance than the latest Arnie flick.

269,Kwah-LeBaire,Romantic?,4,18 May 2010,"This is a movie that divided audiences. A lot of people complained about how slow it was. (""Hurry up and die!"") The script is only 135 pages long, and much of that was left on the cutting room floor, yet the movie still runs for 150 minutes! [ What's missing from the movie? Hana's fiancé makes several appearances in the script and it's sad when Hana learns he is dead. In the movie, she suddenly becomes depressed after somebody prattles on about ""Picton"", as if that meant something. Kip had a major story of his own, all cut from the movie. At one point in the movie he tells Hana he ""wants to be found."" That has a corollary in the script, but it was cut, leaving the line dangling. There's stuff about the sexuality of some of the other team members, almost all cut, but with a couple of tiny, unexplained moments left in the movie. ] STORY The scene is set by a reading from Herodotus (ancient Greek historian) of the story of Candaules, king of Lydia, and Gyges, a soldier. Candaules wants Gyges to be impressed by the beauty of his naked wife, so he sets up an opportunity for Gyges to spy on her when she undresses for bed. The nameless Queen learns of what happened and tells Gyges he must either submit to death for what he's done, or kill Candaules and take his place as King. Assassination follows, with the Queen and Gyges living together happily ever after. When Geoffrey Clifton leaves his wife Katherine behind in the desert while he goes off adventuring, she comes close to dying in a sand storm. Almásy brings her through safely. Subsequently Katherine jumps into bed with Almásy, Geoffrey finds out and, consumed by jealousy tries to kill the three of them by crashing his plane into Almásy on the ground. He dies at once, Katherine dies some undefined time after, and Almásy much later.TIME The dates in the movie don't make much sense. They meet in the desert in 1938. Start the affair during that year and snatch a grubby bonk in a cupboard during the 1938 Xmas Party. The desert story ends after everyone goes home in May 1936, by command of the British Government. Almásy is supposed to be collected by Geoffrey in the plane and be taken out, except he tries to crash the plane into him instead. This must be May 1939. Almásy places the injured Katherine in a cave and heads off for help. He is arrested by the British Army, from whom he escapes, and is assisted by the German Army with fuel to fly another plane back to the cave. This suggests the military situation in North Africa of 1941 or 1942. The plane, with a perfectly preserved corpse in the front seat, is shot down by the Germans (date unknown). Almásy then appears as the Patient in an Allied Hospital train in 1944 in Italy. He lingers until after the European war ends in May 1945. ROMANCE This is, allegedly, a romantic movie. The ""romance"" consists of a married woman having an affair with a bloke she meets in the desert. The high point is the second time they're shown getting together, on her first wedding anniversary, while the cuckolded husband sits in a taxi outside the hotel waiting for her to reappear. He is aware of what is going on inside, but confines his response to sucking warm champagne out of a bottle. If that is ""romance"", I know I could live a long time without any, thank you so much. BODICE RIPPER At the high point of passion, Almásy rips Katherine's blouse open. He is rewarded with sight of a chest to match that of many adolescent males. As compensation, Kristin Scott Thomas provides a view of her pubic region as she decamps a bath. Sexy? No. This is followed by Almásy sewing the blouse together again, which is as close as the movie comes to unbridled excitement.If you enjoy lingering views of desert sand, try LAWRENCE OF ARABIA.",The English Patient

At the beginning of the movie we see Almásy crash with a plane what leads to burnings all over his body. Almásy temporary loses his memory and is taken care of by the Canadian nurse Hana (Juliette Binoche) with whom he shares his returning memories.Nevertheless, The English Patient is not just about this romance. It also makes us aware of the problems of failed communication and of seeing the world only as hostile nationalities.The movie's cast, which combines famous names like Ralph Fiennes, Kristin Scott-Thomas, Juliette Binoche, Colin Forth or Willem Dafoe, is sublime. Fiennes and Scott-Thomas share absolutely great chemistry. Scott-Thomas shows wonderful passion and eroticism, especially with her eyes and Fiennes gives probably one of his most memorable performances. Juliette Binoche is like the emotional center of the movie. She gives a warm, joyous, but also fragile performance that is wonderful to watch.The performances as well as the epic shots, a brilliant score and a passionate screenplay turn this movie in one of today's epic masterpieces which shouldn't only been watched because of its romantic love story but also because of its important historical background.",The English Patient

Despite this though, I was a touch underwhelmed due to the reputation this has as an Oscar-winning tearjerker. What holds this film back from greatness is the lack of likeability of the lead character. Don't get me wrong, Ralph Fiennes is on incredible form with the script he's given, but am I the only one that can't quite get behind a character that so blatantly and unscrupulously makes a play on a married woman? I was rooting more for Colin Firth to take him out with the duster than for the romantic leads to 'live happily ever after'. I just can't shed any tears for the woes of a pair of romantic leads that are so boldly engaging in adultery. That so many people have done I think speaks more about the decline in moral standards in society than anything else.Wonderfully made picture, but the questionable morality holds it back from true greatness.

When I first saw the film in the fall of '96, I felt overwhelmed by what seemed to be a convoluted plot with too many shallow characters. Having watched the film twice since then, however, I have come to appreciate the poetic dialogue as well as the amazing cinematography and score.For me, Hana was the most sympathetic character in the film, marvelously portrayed by Juliette Binoche.  Her spontaneity, beauty, and passion illuminate the screen like no other actress today in such films as ""Bleu"" and ""Damage"".  During ""The English Patient"", she is the character I weep for as everyone she loves is tragically taken from her and yet, she still musters the courage to persevere.This is definitely one of those films that is too complex to comprehend in one viewing.  Because of this, I sincerely understand why many think it is overwrought and pretentious.  Therefore, I am reserved in recommending it to everyone.  The film is similar to ""The Piano"", another film that critics loved but that many viewers disliked for the same above-listed reasons.

The relationship portrayed by Fiennes and Thomas is passionate and enthralling, and as a fan of Ralph Fiennes for some time, I must say that this is probably his most awe-inspiring showing yet.What detracts from this film, unfortunately, is its lack of originality. The typical love story is thankfully elevated by the actors' performances, as well as a wonderfully inventive script. However, I feel that for such a long movie, more time should have been spent developing the main plot (namely, the trials and love of the young count) and less on subplots. Of particular note is the relationship between the nurse and Kip, which I found only confused the meaning of the original storyline.Overall, I would say a well-performed and orchestrated love story, although I am glad that I did not spend $7.50 on it.",The English Patient

However, the plot plods along slower than a geriatric retiree with arthritis in both knees. Why some women think that this is such a romantic tale is a mystery to me -- my confusion must result from a limitation of owning ""Y"" chromosomes. The lesson I took away from the movie was: if you cheat on your husband, you'll die alone in a cold dark cave. When I shared this insight with my wife, she looked at me in horror and said, exasperated, ""You obviously didn't get it."" Too true, and precisely my point. This movie isn't about romance -- it's heavy orchestral atmosphere and pointless tragedy pretending to be romantic. Romances have a hero, and no one -- repeat, no one -- acts heroic in this story. When I left the theatre, I kept wondering: what the heck was the point of that? In short, if you're a man -- unless you have super-extraordinary emotional sensitivity -- you'll be bored out of your mind while watching The English Patient. If you get dragged in to see this movie, bring a lot of patience -- pun intended.",The English Patient
278,jayfurr,Freakin' appaling movie,1,8 April 2004,"I have NEVER been so bored as when I was sitting in a theater with my wife watching this moving.  It was astonishingly pointless and bad.  None of the characters struck me as being even remotely worth my interest.  The plot was nonsensical.  It was one of those ""would it be worth it to gnaw my own leg off to get out of this theater"" moments.My wife, who'd dragged me to it, amazed me after the movie was over by looking at me and saying ""That was truly awful -- I apologize"" before I'd even had a chance to register with her how I felt about it. 
I was stunned when we watched the Oscars that year and saw it take award after award.  At least Juliette Binoche had the decency to apologize to Lauren Bacall for taking a Best Supporting Actress award she had no business being awarded.My God, but that was an awful movie.",The English Patient

It was so awful that, frankly, if I'd been offered the chance to swim through a tank of writhing slugs and leeches instead of watching this movie through I'd gladly go back and choose the swim. The movie made little to no sense, drug on for what seemed like forever, and had characters whose subtle and cloyingly distant personalities engendered in me only the fervid hope that they would all suffer horrible deaths by the movie's end. If only I'd known that my wife, who'd suggested the movie and was sitting next to me in the theater, was praying for a natural disaster to cut the movie short, I could have avoided all the pain and just left before the pain became too intense to bear. Sadly, I assumed that, being a chick, she was enjoying it.",The English Patient

Then why didn't I like this film? I believe my unsophisticated neighbor gave me my answer when she said the film boiled down to ""a fancier '9 1/2 weeks'.""  She was right!In all, I was unmoved by the romance between the Count and Katharine, so much of the film was lost on me.

The setting the time we were in, it really gave the feel we needed, and my god Africa is beautiful! Juliette Binoche was splendid as her role as a caring nurse with her wonderfully big smile. i thought Ralph Fiennes was absolutely phenomenal I felt complete pity over his injurie as being burnt. Kriston Scott Thomas was magnificent with her beauty and presence that i could see even make the laid back actor Fiennes intimidated. Collin firth with his small performance was still great especially when hes in the car and finds out the truth! Kriston and Ralph were unforgettable especially that one scene that never never left me, when he carrys her from the plane notices the thimble and she explains, "" I've always worn it, idiot, i've always loved you"". God that gets me. William Dafoe was great as usual the scene when he loses his, ya.

This one was and still is my ""favourite"". So many things to remember from this movie only if you still have feelings and only if you can see what is beyond words...""Half my days I can not bear not to touch you. The rest of the time I feel it doesn't matter if I ever see you again. It isn't the morality, It is how much you can bear.""""I just want you to know. I don't miss you yet."" His face awful to her, trying to smile. Her head sweeps away from him and hits the side of the gatepost. He see it hurt her, notices the wince. But they have separated already into themselves now, the walls up at her insistence. Her jerk, her pain, is accidental, is intentional. Her hand is near her temple. ""You will."" she says.How does this happen? To fall in love and be dissambled. I was in her arms.I had pushed the sleeve of her shirt up to the shoulder so I could see her vaccination scar. I love this, I said. This plae aureole on her arm. I see the instrument scratch and then punch the serum within her and then release itself, free of her skin, years ago, when she was nine years old, in a school gymnasium. ....""Seas move away, why not lovers? The harbours of Ephesus, the rivers of Heraclitus dissappear and are replaced by estuaries of silt. The wife of Candaules becomes the wife of Gyges. Libraries burn. What had our relationship been? A betrayal of those around us or the desire for another life?"" .....This movie plays a lot of games with words, nationalities, languages and maps. Remember the last words of Catherine Clifton ""All I desired was to walk upon such a world with no maps""...

""A lie. And you?"" ""Ownership"" he says. ""When you leave me, forget me."" Her fist swings towards him and hits hard into the bone just below his eye. She dresses and leaves..........How did you hate me? She whispers in the Cave of Swimmers, talking about her pain of injuries. A broken wrist. Shattered ribs. You were terrible to me. That's when my husband suspected you. I still hate that about you-dissappearing into deserts or bars. You left me in the Groppi Park. Because you didn't want me as anything else. Because you said your husband was going mad. Well, we went mad. Not for a long time. I went mad before he did, you killed everything in me. Kiss me, will you. Stop defending yourself. Kiss me and call me by my name. Their bodies met in perfumes, sweat, frantic to get under that thin film with a tongue or tooth, as if they each could grip character there and during love pull it right off the body of the other. Now there is no talcum on her arm, no rose water on her thigh. You think you are an iconoclast, but you are not. You just move, or replace what you cannot have. If you fail at something you retreat into something else. Nothing changes you. How many women did you have? I left you because I knew I could never change you.

285,claddagh72,"Introspective, beautiful, perfect",10,18 December 2020,"This and ""A Christmas Story"" are my most favorite films. They could not be any more different, except for the theme of obsession. This film is not about shoot 'em ups, or moving on to the next car chase, or really moving on at all. That's why so many want more forward action in the film, and not the loops between the present and past (via the negative reviews.) The film is intense and haunting, just as the characters' pasts and the sadness they carry.
You will love this if:
You are introspective and wonder what makes someone act, speak, think, hurt, heal and hope.You wait for the unraveling and evolving of those answers to unspool at a pace that unveils who these characters were and have become in the story's perfect time. (Just like a book...as this is based on the book.)You can be patient to watch the process of the characters transform their pain, betrayal, and grief.",The English Patient
286,PresterJ,Such unfulfilled promise is a crime.,2,16 June 1999,"Few flims have disappointed me so deeply as this one.  The cinematography is beautiful, and I honestly don't think I can count on my hands the number of films I have seen that were more visually stunnning. But the praise ends there.  The film promises a tragic romance, but delivers only stagnant plot movement, seemingly drawn out to prolong the background scenery, and flat, shallow characters with whom I did not find any sympathy.  Indeed, I found the love affair a tad repulsive, and the immorality of the characters does play some role in this.  The majority of my dissatisfaction, however, resides with my lack of interest in their lives: if the characters have emotion, the audience is not brought to share in that emotion.  I felt quite numb watching this movie, and that is a terrible mistake for a tragic work... tragedy relies on emotion and sympathy, both of which are absent here. The main symbolic thread of the story, the Count's memory and his book, suffers from the same malaise: if it were easier to care about his character, his memories would be very touching.  Unfortunately, the film does not do its job in executing this idea. In short, there are great possibilities in this film for an excellent overall work, but it seems that the story was neglected in favour of adding effort to the visual aesthetics.  Usually, films are revised to add new effects to an existing storyline... Sabrina comes to mind.  In this case, the director should be given a second chance to dazzle audiences with a stunning remake, to add emotion to the existing effects.",The English Patient

In fact, this was one of the worst.Why was I bored?  Because I didn't care about the characters.  The actors did a great job of acting, but the people they portrayed were not interesting.  As I sat through this very long movie, I kept waiting for something to catch my interest.  Nothing ever really did.  I couldn't believe it was even nominated for any of the prestigious film awards.It is interesting to read some of the other comments of viewers who see this film as one of the greats of all time and to see how many ""10's"" it garnered.  I am glad they liked it so much.  But there was little in their positive comments that I agreed with other than there was some wonderful cinematography and that the actors did a good job.

That seems to be the case with The English Patient.No movie deserves 9 Academy Awards.  Not Citizen Kane, not the Godfather, not Casablanca.  The English Patient inexplicably won just that many.  This is justifiably enraging, but take the rage out on the academy not the film. The English Patient is a terrific film, reminiscent of the old epic Hollywood films.  It easily deserved the Oscar for Best Picture.  It is a beautiful and emotional film, with acting rarely seen on the big screen. Many may find it slow, but I for one find it fascinating.Sadly, this film gets lumped together with other dominating films like Titanic and Shakespeare in Love.  None of these films deserved as many awards as they got, but that should not take away from the films.  Of the three, TEP is easily the best.  Forget the awards and enjoy.  9 out of 10.

""The English Patient"" makes gloriously full use of late twentieth century cinematic technology to produce a commentary upon amorous passion of a percipience that verges on the unearthly. The performances are uniformally magnificent, with Juliette Binoche especially affecting.Like Kate Winslet, Binoche is a romantic tragedienne of genius. But Ralph Fiennes and Kristen Scott Thomas are hardly less magnificent. The film gives proof of the potential aesthetic and emotional power at the disposal of contemporary film-makers, and it makes full use of it. The final quarter of an hour puts this film in the category of the greatest of all time...such is the sublimity of direction, editing, acting, music, structure...But is it the greatest film ever? Reservations have to be expressed; moral ones for instance; the lead characters are hardly admirable, even if they are eminently pitiable. And then there is the sexual content, which is strong in parts. But ""The English Patient"" can be seen as a profoundly moral commentary on the doomed nature of love deceptive and adulterous.

So much of the film comes together perfectly.  The music enhances the scenery, which adds to the on-screen chemistry between the actors.  I really have nothing negative to say about the movie.  Admittedly, many would argue that it is a typical ""chick-flick,"" and only a woman would enjoy it, but I believe there are elements that everyone can appreciate.

298,ripplesofserenity,"An epic of life, death, love, sensuality and war.",8,20 March 2010,"The English Patient grabbed nine Oscars (including the Best Picture), along with three other nominations in 1997. Need I say more that this is a must watch. A word of caution this is not your regular movie; it is slow, steady, poetic and slightly on the classical side (if you get my drift).The movie open with an aircraft shot down somewhere in Sahara Desert. The pilot, Count Laszlo Almasy (Ralph Fiennes), survives with some serious burns and very little recollection of the past, and is rescued by a Bedouin. Turned over to the Canadian medical unit stationed in Italy, with nothing to go on (due to serious burns and amnesia) he is named ""English Patient"".Hana (Juliette Binoche), a nurse in the unit takes care of him. Realizing that ""English Patient"" is slowly dying, Hana manages to persuade here superior to care for him alone in an abandoned villa, until he succumbs to inevitable.It is not too late they are accompanied by- a mysterious, crippled war veteran named Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), who has a hidden agenda, and a pair of bomb experts, the British Sgt. Hardy (Kevin Whately) and his Sikh superior, Kip (Naveen Andrews).The storyline swings to-and-fro between past and present, through dreams and waking flashbacks as Laszlo's memory slowly return. Constant flip-flops between late-'30s and early- '40s, reveal Laszlo to be a part of a British map-making effort of Sahara under the banner of Royal Geographical Society. It's then that he meets Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas), the wife of a fellow pilot (Colin Firth) who is helping with the project. Laszlo and Katharine fall for each other, and so to forbidden tale of love starts.It sure throbs of melodrama; I would rather like to call it classical. In its defence, it is a well-crafted story brought to screen with great care by British playwright and director Anthony Minghella and based on the prize-winning novel by Michael Ondaatje, that serves up the love of Almasy and Katharinein a way that is simultaneously epic and intimate.The one flaw in The English Patient- The ""modern-day"" scenes with Almasy awaiting death aren't as nearly as involving as the flashback sequences. Characters of Hana and Kip aren't fully-realized, though they are on sideline, the scenes that take place in this time frame, some of which are quite lengthy, seem unwanted interruptions.The English Patient is an epic of life, death, love, sensuality and war. It is heartbreakingly poetic, wonderfully directed, keen importance to detail, and contrast of pain and pleasure. It is a sort of love story that seem rare these days.",The English Patient

I've seen some reviews which say it's a bore, but this is not an action thriller, this is a movie that will move you and may bring you tears. The sadness is profound. Check the awards for this movie and you'll see that it got the credit it deserves...it is a modern masterpiece in the style of LOA, with the desert playing its role as both a beautiful backdrop and unforgiving harsh reality. The story is told as a revelation, jumping back and forth between the current time and the few years prior, a slow revelation as a lonely nurse finds her ability to love again, a vengeful spy learns to forgive, and a dying man learns acceptance and his final peace. This film is a good selection for 'settled' couples and married ones, and bring the tissues, for both women and men....it'll tear your heart out.

Then, as with films that have made an impact, it rattled round my brain for a month or two. Various scenes, snatches of dialogue, single shots etc., kept coming back and my feeling that this really was something very special slowly took hold. Yesterday I watched it twice. I can't fault it. Technically it is perfect. The story is perfectly told and the Mingella always stays consistent in his telling of it. The acting is marvellous; one becomes accustomed to over-the-top histrionics passing for acting. So many of the big box office ""stars"" have survived on this kind of nonsense for so long that a lot of film goers no longer have any yardstick to measure by when the real thing presents itself. A special word for the cameraman, thank you you're an artisan in the very best sense of the word. I place this film on a par with ""The Duellists"" for camera-work, on a par with ""The Remains of the Day"" for acting and as good as anything I've ever seen for it's direction.

Why on earth was she cast for this role? I know it's unfair to compare film & novel, but wouldn't it have been possible to make her character just a LITTLE bit more downcast? Binoche is an actress whose radiance just cannot be turned off it seems which make it look that she's generally very happy with the situation she's in with just the odd bit of feeling a little down (like when she finds out her boyfriend's been shot to bits & when she sees Jan being blown to pieces). Not very believable. Thank goodness Fiennes, Scott Thomas and Dafoe make up for it all with their BRILLIANT performances for which they should all have received Oscars. I still think Ralph and Krisitin would have won if they had been American instead of British.Such beautiful colours, such moving music and a perfect script as well (with a STORY! Wow! VERY un-90s).

305,Almasy-6,TRY TO UNDERSTAND IT. DON´T BE OBTUSE.,10,13 May 1999,"I Love the Internet Movie Database, it's the best site for movie freaks like me. I also love to read comments of my favorite movies; I'm very objective in that matter, everyone is free to say his own opinion. And in the comments of  movies like Star Wars, A Clockwork Orange, 2001, Alien, Titanic, Citizen Kane (some of my favourite movies) I've read some likable comments and some disgusting points of view, but I accepted their opinion. But When I got to read The English Patient (Which, if you read my name at the title of this comment you'll see how fan I am) comments I couldn't stand it anymore, I have to make you all understand why this movie deserves NINE Oscars. This goes out especially to the people out there that sympathizes with Elaine (from Seinfeld) opinion of this movie. When 2001 hit the theaters in 1968, many people hated it, they said it was boring and too long. Ok, it didn't win nine oscars but its considered the best science fiction film of all time; its funny the fact that it was a boxoffice success because of the hippies who loved the coloured psychedelic journey. What I mean by this is that when you see a movie first of all you gotta know previously what kind of movie you are going to see. If is a movie like Independence Day or Twister you should expect explosion, great SFX, cool dialogues, and an acceptable running time. But if you´re going to see a movie named TEP, 2001, The Godfather, The Thin Red Line, you got to have a open mind about the whole context of it.  That´s why I can see almost every kind of movie they´re showing, except musicals (I hate musicals).The English Patient opens with a beautiful image of a brush painting a figure we don´t know what it is yet. A woman's voice begins to sing---Szerelem, szerelem, she cries in a haunting lament for her loved one. After the credits we realized the figure is a man swimming (we´ll see where that comes from later). Then we change our view to THE DESERT seen from the air. An ocean of dunes (remember the swimmer) for mile after mile. The late sun turns the sand every color from crimson to black and makes the dunes look like bodies pressed against each other. An old AIRPLANE is flying over the Sahara, there is a woman who appears to be asleep, behind her the pilot , a man, wears goggles and a leather helmet. He is singing, too, but we can't hear him or the plane or anything save the singer's plaintive voice.This are the first images of TEP and believe me it captures my attention simply because of its beauty; maybe because I love the desert. I own this movie on DVD and every frame of the cinematography is worth pausing and admiring. TEP is a movie about mature and intellectual people who are caught up in a time of barbarians who only think about making history by obtaining power over the world. The team of International Explorers are only thinking about making history by contributing with proofs of ancient civilization. They don´t care about countries, or frontiers. You have to be very observant in a movie like this. Watch every frame, it doesn´t matter who long does it last on screen, in a movie like this is not there just because of a bad editing. Think about Hana for a moment, she´s the most naive character in the movie ""I don´t know about anything"" she say to TEP when he´s talking about Herodotus, but despite of this she´s the most sympathetic character in the film. Catherine and Count Almasy are the main love story, they are intelligent and passionate characters. She´s married to a clown and sees in Almasy a mysterious man who talks many languages (but doesn´t like to talk), knows many cultures, doesn´t have a home, has got a beautiful handwriting, wrotes poems and its passionate about beauty and art, and if that wasn´t enough he´s handsome; what more do you want?. Many people just sees those two like a lustful couple who have no really interest in the other but in sex. That´s an easy answer for somebody who don´t understand them. When they met they have a discussion about an essay Almasy wrote, there they have their first chemistry shock. When they are telling stories in front of the fire everybody male (except Almasy) is telling a funny and shallow story, but when Catherine´s turn is up she impresses everybody (especially Almasy) by telling a story from Herodotus about a king named Candaules (who is a metaphor of Clifton) who is too proud of his wife and he´s showing her to a subject naked and by that shaming her.  Almasy is mighty attracted to her and that´s why he doesn´t want her to stay when Clifton leaves for an errand, and that´s why he´s rude why her whenever she tries to talk to him or give him the paintings of the swimmers from the credits. This is not an ordinary couple, this is a mature couple of two adults who feel an enourmus attraction and by that betrays everything they know by being together, although she (being a woman) has more integrity at betrayal and leaves him because she knows that´ll never work. I don´t know about you but I have 21 years old and I´ve been in those situations when you are so attracted to a girl, and also is she but cannot be together because she is already taken and cannot betray the man that she loves (or once loved for that matter). The Ending is what I call total climax. There is our Count Almasy running in the desert to save the woman he loves, and maybe he´s thinking that if he does they can be together, and believe it or not they die together (metaphorically). Honestly, If I was going to die of love, I hope it´ll be like that. I´m not going to tell the whole meaning of every part of the movie, I will leave it here. I hope it makes you think more about movies and especially this one. Why if any of you people didn´t like ""2001, The Thin Red Line, and The English Patient"" think it won so many Awards?, you just have to look further deep. You cannot expect to be told everything in the script or in the images (although they have).",The English Patient
306,Mr Lombardo,Just a distant memory,5,9 May 1999,"The one word that springs to mind in describing this film is 'indifferent'. It is beautiful to look at, just like Scott-Thomas, but also like Scott-Thomas at its centre it seems a cold-hearted passionless affair. Perhaps the main reason for this is that the grandiose love story is told through a series of flashbacks as the Fiennes character 'regains' his memory.  Minghella has opted to tell the story through memories, trying to induce the romantic notion of a timeless love by setting it in another land and another time.  We never actually meet Katharine Clifton, the aim of this probably being to create a woman unflawed by reality - a fantasy that exists only in our dreams.  The only purpose of the 'present day'  story seems to be to offset the flashbacks as ethereal and other-worldly.  This is where the problem lies - the flashbacks do come off as distant memories,  the sort of memories that bring a sad smile to your face as you remember something special but doomed but without reliving any of the strong feelings associated with the events themselves!  The photography and the music are exceptional but Minghella comes across as a David Lean wannabe. Everything about this film is understatement, and this was never a characteristic that could be associated with Lean or the classic cinema The English Patient aspires to be.  To just write off this film would be wrong - it does have many appreciable qualities, but a rip-roaring romance it is not.  Not that it was ever intended to be, but perhaps it should have been.",The English Patient

I think the actors are good (special mention to Kristin Scott Thomas) but the entire movie is an astute fake masterpiece. We've got all the ingredients: a torrid adulterine love affair, the desert, the Second World War, the Tuscany country and the charming Egypt, the spyes, the memories, a diary... everything you  need to create a kolossal and most of all an Academy Award winner.

I'm glad I saw for myself. What a beautiful, moving, intelligent movie. People who complain about being bored by it should go back to their video games, pro wrestling and MTV. This is great stuff. The locations are dazzlingly gorgeous, the story is compelling and well-told, and the performances are outstanding. And as a bonus, Kristin Scott Thomas and Juliette Binoche are astonishingly lovely. My only problem is the sometimes incomprehensible dialogue, lost in accents and whispers, and the rare clinker of a line.

She told me I'd love it, and that it was a touching movie.  Well, she was wrong.  I hated it.  I found it to be a worthless pile of dog feces on film.  I couldn't believe that anyone would make a film so pointless.So, for the last eight years, I've been dogging on ""The English Patient."" I'd say things like, ""Yeah, Gigli was bad, but it was better than The English Patient.""  Then last week, on the insistence of a good friend of mine, I watched ""The English Patient"" again.  Honestly, I didn't have my hopes up, and didn't expect it to be any different than when I first saw it.  I'm not too proud to admit that I was way off base.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The cinematography was stunning.  The story was compelling.  The acting was top-notch.

311,veranjank,Back to the Days of Great Love Stories,10,26 February 2003,"The English Patient (1996)Back to the days of great love storiesRare are love stories related in such a dispassionate tone, relying totally on the power of the story itself. Now I have not read the book, and I am sure that the success of the film is due partly to the book. But the visual input and the creation of moods bring out the beauty and the tragedy of the story marvellously. I thought that with the demise of David Lean the days of big movies that could haunt the viewer days or weeks afterwards were over; but thanks to Anthony Minghella, we can look forward to glory days ahead.One cannot talk about The English Patient without talking about Gabriel Yared's beautiful score. Again I am reminded of Lean's Doctor Zhivago that owed much to Maurice Jarre's score. Minghella really knows what to concentrate on to get the maximum effect on the viewer.The final message, however goes beyond a tragic love story. The futility of war, hollowness of personal enmity, and the beauty of love are all drilled in with quiet vigour. After all, nine Oscars are not too much for such a masterpiece. I am compelled to give 10 out of 10!By the way, it makes me happy to note that Michael Ondatje, the writer, is a Sri Lankan born Canadian.",The English Patient
312,arilicious234,BEYOND underrated!,10,14 March 2011,"Not in the top 250? Slow and broing?When I heard that this movie was ""slow and boring"" I thought I'd see for myself; so when I finally did last Saturday, there was not one moment when I was bored. The entire time I was watching, I just felt so...captivated and amazed at how amazing not only the story was but the acting was just perfect! I seriously do not understand why this is not in the top 250, it's one of the BEST romance movies, one of the best WWII movies, and a Best Picture win deserved 250%. All of the casting in this movie was just absolutely perfect, even if Fox would've preferred to cast ""well-known, American actors"" but they wouldn't have been anywhere near as good as Ralph Fiennes, Kristin Scott Thomas, Juliette Binoche or Willem Dafoe. Seeing Fiennes as this damaged, burn victim dying, and then seeing him before all of it shows how great and underrated of an actor he truly is, showing diversity right there but not only resting on the makeup. The story might seem like a ""typical love story"" but it's much more than that. Sure, there are tons of movies with this similar storyline, but the main reason this one stands out to me is because of how much passion is really told through it; how Almasy had to leave Katherine's body in the cave and let her die was the most heart-breaking scene from a movie that I'd seen in such a long time. A true masterpiece, even if it has been forgotten about now, this is a movie that I certainly will never forget, and Anthony Minghella, will never be forgotten either.",The English Patient

Decent adaptation of a well-received book; this is one which could have done with a little ruthlessness when transferring it to film, however. Almost seems to be in love with itself - a little too convinced of its own splendour and profundity. Rafe gives a reprise of his slightly psycho grumpy sod. Kristin Scott Thomas is delicious but a little too modern, perhaps. The excellent and battling Juliette Binoche miscast (at age 32) as a teenager growing up fast in war. The movie wavers between an apparent desire for on-the-mark period realism and sudden clanging bits of contemporary dialogue and delivery. Lusciously filmed and staged, however. All in all more of a 6.5, but something wasn't quite hitting the note for me, so I rounded down for the statisticians...",The English Patient

He plays so well the man that falls in love slowly but so deeply with Katherine Clifton,opens up his heart and dives into this prohibited affair.The most heart-breaking scene for me will always be the one where hurt Katherine is carried by Almasy towards the Cave of Swimmers and she wears the thimble that he bought her.She says 'I always wore it.I always loved you' and at that moment he starts crying with such pain flowing from inside him.Juliette Binoche is also amazing in her performance and really deserved the Oscar she won.Overall, this is a film that anybody who proclaims himself a cinema lover should watch in their lives.",The English Patient

318,tmeyer,Love Story ?,3,5 February 1999,"I, like seemingly most American males here, think this film is way overrated.  Yes, it had some great cinematography, which looked great on DVD.  But, for me, there wasn't one character (well, possibly Juliette Binoche) for whom I had even one lick of emotion.  I found there to be absolutely *no* chemistry between Fiennes & KST.  Fiennes sleepwalked throught virtually the entire thing.  Is 30 seconds of weeping supposed to make up for almost 3 hours of being utterly morose ? Also, the Defoe character was a complete red herring, placed in the movie simply to give Fiennes a reason to explain what happened.  Why was it necessary to show him getting is thumbs cut off ? Sure, I'm glad Juergen Prochnow got a paycheck, but he should have been left on the cutting room floor.Yes, I think I ""get"" it.  The theme of losing things that one loves is pretty obvious, but for me, there are many other great, emotional dramas to see instead of this. Blue (w/ Binoche), Exotica, The Sweet Hereafter, From Here to Eternity, Double Life of Veronique all tower over TEP when it comes to emotional impact. Ugh.",The English Patient

I missed the very beginning, in which a plane crashes in the desert, and one character heads out to find help for the other, badly wounded.  After hearing about this film for months, and watching it steal the majority of that year's Academy Award, I was expecting something fantastic.  So, the entire movie while I watched one guy trying to get help and bring it back for his girl, I wondered how they got there.  To tell you the truth, I was bored out of my mind.  Not only is the plot slow-moving, the character development and larger purpose of the movie is vague at best.  The only thing that kept me watching through the entire excrutiating three hours was the suspense: what happened to these people?  At the end, I realized no answer was coming, and what I had wondered all along was the movie's opening scene; there would be no exciting twist or revelation.

Influence on viewer's subconsciousness by troubling his hearing, his sight... Maybe even smell and touch associations. The point is that this way a viewer gets involved with the picture and only then starts to percept the events, the deeper meaning and everything.

This movie gives hope to those who thought that the classic movies of the past were gone forever.  The movie is beautiful.  The actors are first rate.  I felt their passion.  Their heartbreak.  This is one of those rare movies that touches, not only your heart, but your soul, as well.  I now own the movie, and no matter how many times I see it, I can't help but cry.  There are a few scenes at end, that you will carry with after the movie is over.  I can't recommend this movie enough.  It is a must see for anyone who has ever loved.  Ralph Fiennes is one of those rare actors who convince you that he is his character, and not just reading lines from a script.

Yes, the scenery is stunning and it is a beautifully made and shot movie. It seems there is no elation as the credits roll, just a profound sense of loss and sadness.

327,rstory-3,Adjectives for love,10,29 November 2019,"Early in the film the subjects of adjectives comes up between the two people who begin the first romance in this film. The film then proceeds to demonstrate the many kinds of love a person may encounter. It matters not their wants, but what befalls them takes control. The adjectives mount up as their lives collide on courses they never dreamed of following. Romantic, lustful and enduring are some of the ""adjectives"" that engulf them . Intense joy, hate and pain are the emotions these passions bring out. Sometimes the price is high, but with no regrets.The background is set just prior and through World War II. It is both a enemy and an ally to these lover's passions, but it has no strength against these passions. It enforces them.I have not read the novel, but script is superb. The characters are strong and you will see them grow as they navigate the mania of their desires. I will defend the indulgence of adjectives because that is the theme of this film and of my review.The script uses what is called flashbacks, but they seem more like dreams. The settings and the visual effects give these flashbacks this dreamlike quality.The settings switch from the vast expanse of the deserts of North Africa to a darkened interior of an enclosed truck cab. Sometimes in bright sunlight and then in the firelight of candles and campfires.The action is sharp and sudden. Not prolonged. It is meant to have an effect on the story and not be overwhelming. The performance of the cast is spot on.I would suggest watching this more. I know I needed to, so I could absorb all the detail this film has to offer.Enjoy",The English Patient
328,Eskargot,Not enough English Patience for the English Patient,2,5 June 2002,"Working with cinemas, I am constantly surprised at what the industry has approved. Every week she churns out another laughable/dull story, masquerading behind a facade of beautiful cinematography or some loud noises and spectacular explosions.Of the latter variety, we find a list including such almost homo-erotic classics as Rambo, and the unforgiveable Under-Siege. The former would include 7 years in Tibet, Pearl Harbour. The English Patient unfortunately does little to stem the tide of s***e that drowns the public in an oppressive mediocrity. In fact it muscles in its posterior and seats its fat arse between these two muppets of Hollywood History.Before discordance escalates about my review, I would like to say that despite being male, I do like some romantic films. The fact that it is a romance is not my problem. My problem is that this film is utterly rubbish.If you don't want to know what happens then don't read the following -
A burnt Hungarian guy hangs out with some nurse and has flashbacks about an affair he had. Then some guy without any thumbs shows up demanding a little screen-time.The main protagonists in the flashbacks are unbearably self-centered and include a naive dumbass (Firth), a self-pitying slapper (Scott-Thomas) and an obsessive fool who seems more interested in owning a woman than loving one (Feinnes).This film cuts in neither in a plot-driven nor Character-driven genre. Any political undertones were quickly shoved under the carpet to discourage too much thought.So how come so many people like it? One word would be 'Cinematography'. Would anyone like this if it had a less beautiful setting?... say in Hull or Wolverhampton? I doubt it. Maybe the last 15 minutes were magnificent but I thought my arse had been punished enough. There is absolutely no excuse for the feats of willpower one has to endure in watching such an overblown and simply uneventful pass at a film.",The English Patient
329,pcchap,"Too much film, too little subject matter",1,30 October 2004,"If I had to choose one word to describe this film, it would have to be tedious. I am always surprised that some people seem to rate the film highly and would be interested to come across an explanation that stood out as encapsulating the feeling people have for the movie. I have seen some comments about the love theme (sigh) but there are so many films which cover that so much better. I think there are many disjointed scenes which do not relate to the overall plot (such that it is) of the film. The overall story is too thin to be worth the agonising slowness of the development. This film could perhaps have made some impact as a slightly diverting short story. I think the warning to the viewer comes in the occupation of the main character. He is a map maker mapping the Sahara Desert. This cannot be the most exciting of tasks for the main character to undertake. However it does rather set the scene for the remainder of the film. No doubt there will be posts after this one singing the praises of the film and expressing how wrong those who disagree are. I guess it is a film which will continue to leave some loving it and others loathing it, both with equal passion, (which incidentally I find lacking in the film).",The English Patient
330,pcchap,map maker employed to chart the vast expanses of the Sahara Desert,1,26 November 2004,"I quote from the plot summary for The English Patient: ""Beginning in the 1930's, ""The English Patient"" tells the story of Count Almasy who is a Hungarian map maker employed by the Royal Geographical Society to chart the vast expanses of the Sahara Desert""The maps play a pivotal part in the plot. I won't mention what it is here for fear of spoiling the film for those that have not seen it.As I mentioned in an earlier review I believe that mapping the Sahara is not a good start for a storyline. Don't be misled by reviews which suggest the character is not mapping the Sahara.There seems to be a sense of superiority present on the comments and message boards about the film. I think it is important to consider the comments about the film, see the movie and decide for yourself, rather than get too hung up on the comments about other comments. If you watch the movie I hope you enjoy it but it's OK not to like it too.",The English Patient
331,cokramer,Not About Love Per Se,7,27 March 2007,"The book is better than the film mostly because of the writer Ondatje's prose. Before I saw this film, someone who had seen it, told me the love depicted in this film isn't real. After seeing this film, I can see how her suspension of disbelief in this regard could've been distracting to other movie-goers as well. Frankly, some of the intense displays of love were laughable and seem to be on the edge of parody. But by the end, everyone should realize this is a big message piece of art. It is not specifically about love at all, it uses ""love"" to dialectically reveal the human divide or the arbitrary borders of countries that help justify wars and hatred. It is about misunderstandings and the blind following of the things that supposedly separate us. The critical scene for the real theme of this movie is when the hero or antihero's pleas for help for his stranded lover in the desert is ignored and disregarded for the reasons shown in that scene. This film is also about hope and forgiveness, the hope epitomized in the interracial relationship between Binoche's recovering character and the Indian minesweeper (echoed in the Sikh's buddy-buddy relationship with his white coworker who ends up dying nonsensically) and the forgiveness epitomized in the Caravaggio character's first hunt and then forcing out of what he thinks will be the hero's confessions for his war ""crimes"" (betrayal of country). I think the film could've been made even better than it is. I don't know if a more realistic portrayal of the circumstances of love would've made the real themes and points of this film even more obvious or not, but I agree this film is not about realistic romantic love, as the people behind this piece of art or film imply in an early scene when the eventual lovers first meet. The hero talks about how a new car, broken-down car, fast car, etc. (I'm paraphrasing) is still just a car no matter what adjective you put in front of it. She replies but parental love, platonic love, romantic love, etc. are very different kinds of love. This is ironic because this film is really about the one love all humans should want which is the love of (or for) peace (not materialistic things which are usually the real reasons for wars, epitomized in something most of us want such as ""cars"", let's say). Otherwise, we may be left stranded to die in a cave in a vast desert with ancient wall art/drawings of swimmers, suggesting that the seas and life-supporting waters which were once there have all but disappeared. I believe ""The English Patient"" won the Oscar because of these big messages not specifically for its depiction of romantic love. Awards tend to go that way. The relationship of the hero and heroine was necessary to draw the audience in, unfortunately this view of love may be antiquated in the age of divorce and so many singles who can't seem to get together on so many levels, so ridiculous versions of mythic love are hard to get into, even in daydreams, which film love has always been, especially in good old Hollywood. The film may fall short of what people expect but a 7 out of 10 movie worth seeing, regardless.",The English Patient
332,Susie-3,I don't get it.,2,23 March 1999,"When I say I don't get it, I don't mean to imply that I didn't understand the movie.  What I don't get is why we are supposed to care about such unsympathetic, flat characters.  And I also don't get how this movie could possibly have won best picture; it is boring, overdone, and pretentious, and nice scenery does not make up for a lack of substance.  I did not care what happened to either Ralph Fiennes or Kristin Scott Thomas; neither one gave me any reason to care.  I agree with the comments that there is no indication that there was any real love here.  It looked like a case of raging hormones to me.  Are we given any reason why we should not despise KST for cheating on her husband over a prolonged period of time? No.  Are we given any reason why we should not despise Fiennes for sleeping with his best friend's wife over a prolonged period of time? No.  Are we given any reason why we should believe their relationship is based on anything more than lust? That scene at the Christmas dinner or whatever it was is a good example of how completely unlikable these characters were.  I did like the character played by Binoche, and I did care what happened to her and Andrews' character, but this relationship was barely touched on in the movie, though I understand it is more important in the book.  These characters were not despicable and showed more depth, and as far as I am concerned, they are the only reasons that this movie wasn't intolerable and completely without merit- other than the wonderful scenery, of course, which we are shown again and again and again.I am not American (though I'm not sure if being Canadian is considered by many others to be more American-like or more European-like, or just different) and I am not male, and I don't see what these qualities have to do with anything anyway; a bad movie is a bad movie, and this was indeed a bad movie.  I don't need massive explosions or shoot-outs, nor do I need lots of sex (though this movie had plenty of that) in order to enjoy a movie.  I like a good story.  I prefer talking to action.  But none of this means anything if the characters are not likable.  Likewise, likable characters can make a bad movie passable.  In this case, Binoche's character keeps this movie from being downright horrible, instead bringing it up into the low end of mediocrity.",The English Patient

Minghella's screenplay is a masterpiece which separates The English Patient from the many solid but uninspired historical dramas of late.  Fortunately, the script is complemented by the virtuosic performances of Ralph Fiennes, Kristin Scott Thomas, and Juliette Binoche and the stunning cinematography of John Seale.  Many moviegoers (and many critics) seem unable to grasp the complexity and subtlety of the film, which follows two time lines and examines history from a decidedly postmodern, non-Americano-centric position. Although the film has already enjoyed considerable critical acclaim, I believe the wider world (even Americans) will soon catch up with the vision of this film, and The English Patient will be established as one of the great movies of all time.",The English Patient

Similarity of the film with TEP ends there. ""Fortune"" has real story and acting, and good ones on top of it, thank heavens.

In that screenplay, he managed to incorporate the entire novel, in cinematic terms.  Of course, it would probably have made a six-hour film! As it is, I feel he did catch most of the essense of the book; in fact there are areas where I think he improved on the original.  (For example, I liked his making Katharine and Geoffrey the same age as Almasy, and making the husband more attractive.)I've seen the film many times.  I gather some of the recent commentators have seen it only on video or DVD.  This is one of those films that really need to be seen on the big screen.Still, it's not a picture for everyone -- and that's true of all movies. For me, it's a ""ten.""",The English Patient

339,hawain-sunset,Why do two people madly love each other? It is just sex? Thats it?,2,30 December 2008,"I am slightly surprised by the overwhelming positive reviews given to this movie. I understand that the cinematography is good, acting is decent and overall the movie is OK, but Oscar for best movie, even before Fargo? Please!My main gripe is that it seems like a glorified one night stand. I am not criticizing this movie from a moral standpoint. I have no issues with people sleeping around. What bothers me most is that there was absolutely no effort by the director to develop the main characters of Ralph Fiennes (RF) and Kristin Scott Thomas (KST). RF is a wooden, dis- respectful loner and KST is a bored housewife. They spend a couple of days in desert and start sleeping around. I understand this. It can happen. But they are madly in love? Really? Why? What was it in RF's character that made KST's character to fall for him completely? Except many of those love scenes, I can't point a single instance where I felt that there was something happening between the two. It just felt that director was focusing so much on passion (read numerous one night - day - afternoon stands) that it seemed nonsensical. The only slightly likable character is that of Juliet Binoche as Hanna. Her acting is good. But she has been underutilized. And even in her case, her affection for the Sikh soldier (Naveen Andrews) seems so made up and fake.Why do two people fall in love with each other and remain in love till the end? If you think that the English Patient will give any answers then look elsewhere. Its a huge disappointment.",The English Patient

Disappointingly the reviews often seem to be an indication of the reviewer's attention span more than a fair critique.I don't care much about cinematography, art direction, lighting etc. all I know is that this movie looks beautiful, has many scenes that stay etched in the memory and has an elegant pacing to do justice to the book. The central scenes in the abandoned church while the nurse takes care of the dying man are really fine. There is a wonderful stillness that is rare in western filmmaking. I'm sorry people are offended at the (obvious) immorality of some of the characters but I don't think anyone claims that these guys are heroic, only human. I guess I can relate better to humans than heroes.If you didn't enjoy this movie last time, or haven't seen it yet then wait till it is on TV on a quiet afternoon or evening, put other things out of your mind, sit back and soak up this great movie. 10/10",The English Patient

When Katherine asks, her voice breaking 'am I K in your book, I think I must be', when the flare lights up the sky as Almache brings him arm across her neck.  This is photography to marvel at, to revel in.  The desert is brought to life, in rich, vivid textures, in marvellous detail and astounding beauty.  Music to make your heart soar, to bring tears to your eyes.  The story is fantastic (though you have to read the book to appreciate all the nuances, particularly those around Hana, Kip and Caravaggio), an epic romantic tragedy that rivals (and indeed surpasses) the melodramas of yesteryear.

343,roryboo,Beautiful,8,22 July 2010,"Well, to begin with, I liked the movie. It's rather long, and I had to switch it off and resume watching later, but I couldn't wait to resume. There are people saying how boring and stupid it is. It's true, to some extent: it lacks movement and tension, but before saying whether it's boring or not one should determine what genre it is. See, there are deserts but it's not Indiana Jones, there are planes, soldiers, nurses, but it's not a war movie. It's a romantic story, a love story, and everything: location, characters, time - fits this romantic pattern. We see exotic desert landscapes, Cairo, caves, sandstorms (on the one hand), and an Italian villa stuffed with mines (on the other), set before/during/right after WWII, - this would be an extraordinary situation. Now, characters. Explorers, a nurse, a sapper, a thief, German soldiers, spies... And the main hero is a Hungarian count, out in Africa making maps, moreover, a member of the Royal Geographical Society. Here are our extraordinary characters.The point is that all this wouldn't drag a motion picture higher than 5 out of 10. It's then just a clear-cut example, nothing out of the ordinary. What makes this film very good (at least) is the acting. The performances are brilliant on the part of Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas. Besides, it's very beautifully shot. It's enjoyable, just like any romantic story should be. Although there's nothing really clever, or sophisticated, or globally important about it, but I wouldn't call it stupid.Oh, and there's another curious thing about the movie. The love itself isn't shown here like anything sudden, unusual, something that breaks down settled, happy lives of the characters. It just happens, and that's all. To me it even seemed that those lives were broken even before the events described.",The English Patient

From the bloody European villages to the beautiful African desert, it's all present to us with such a subtlety, that you become part of the film.Cinematography apart the cast works magic , superb performances from Binoche, Fiennes, Dafoe and a truly magnificent Kristin Scott Thomas (almost fell in love for her).Two amazing love stories, and some converging plots, make this film more gripping than most of the thrillers around (my favourite genre).",The English Patient

I love the interaction between the players; the subtle relationships; the period atmosphere. Ralph Fiennes is perfectly cast as the brooding lover and Geoffrey the wronged husband is beautifully underplayed by Colin Firth. The scene in the sand storm where Catherine & El-masy are discussing the different types of sand storms is one of the high-lights of the film and where the affair really starts.

It seems like they're obssesed with the surface, not with each other. The camera work had nothing out of the ordinary and most of the other caracters were blunt. Ralph Fiennes' performance was amazing as always and Juliette's was at least not distracting from the movie which is why this movie is not getting a 1 star.The cinematography was overrated.

349,biggie2pac4lyf,A somewhat flawed but deeply satisfying endeavour into the extent of human passion,8,20 October 2015,"The English Patient left me feeling complete, with no unanswered questions, or lingering emotions. This can be a good and bad thing, but with the nature of such a narrative (the flashbacks that make up the bulk of the picture) it is essentially an investigation, so indeed a visceral, but neat conclusion is fitting. The film is beautifully acted by an as always masterful Ralph Fiennes, the astonishingly transient Juliette Binoche, and the surprisingly great Kristen Scott Thomas. On top of these three are a plethora of reasonably memorable support characters, including Willem Dafoe, among others less worthy of comment. I found it to appear shot well enough, although there were some strange decisions with regards to camera-work that often puzzled, however. The haunting aesthetic of the Egyptian desert is an especially dominant presence, and I admired the way in which the filmmakers did not resort to constant 'sweeping establishing shots' to wow the audience. However, most of the scenes are simply constructed, and I do wish some more artistic decisions were made.Critically, there were moments where the film left me frustrated. For example, Dafoe's sudden emergence as Carvaggio was bordering on absurd, and certainly towards the end of the piece, the present day sequences seemed almost cartoonish: a whole host of reliably diverse and colourful characters living in the ruins of an old mansion, sometimes making love, always ignoring the supposedly urgent matter of World War Two cascading around them.Ultimately though, the relationship between Fiennes' character and Thomas' was thrilling, and the drama surrounding it was gripping to the same extent. This is pretty much the solid, believable core of an overall great romance/drama/war picture. The minutes just fly by.",The English Patient

358,t_ilcev,PERFECT.Period,10,23 June 2008,"I felt I must add a comment because it is simply beyond my comprehension why some people did not understand or like this film. This is one of the greatest stories about love and passion I have ever seen.One of my friends said that the beahvior of those two people was despicable. But,who are we to judge or despise them? Are any explanations given in Wuthering Heights for the case of mad passion Heatcliff and Catherine had for each other?(who were,BTW,played in one of the many on-screen adaptations of this exceptional novel,by the same outstanding actors Binoche & Fiennes).My friend also saw the count as a snobbish, cold, unlikable bastard. Those characters are not unlikable-the Count has never asked for anyone's sympathy or understanding.He had died long ago,along with his love, and is nothing but a human wreck,a shell containing broken bits & pieces of memories of a shattered life.And, the story is narrated by him, in many flash-backs & digressions, to match the structure of his memories.Everybody is concentrating only on the two parallel love stories inside the plot. But, they are just the means to deliver many themes,such as the question of nationality Vs. identity, love and its ability to overcome borders-the film is NOT about map-making! Count Almasy and Catherine are very complicated characters, and we are allowed to take but a glimpse inside of their intricate souls. I cannot help but feel attracted to them. His rather clear-minded,rational points of view of history, the world, life in general, are deeply shaken by the sudden passion for this intelligent, sensuous, married woman.You can see the change in him happening in front of your eyes-remember if you were surprised when he wanted to know the name of the base of a woman's neck in the middle of the fuss before having been forced to flight Cairo. Yes,they both may have done some despicable things,like lying, cheating etc. from an objective point of view. He has even helped the Germans by giving them the maps and thus broken his friend's heart.But, in his mind, where such abstractions like nationality & citizenship were not enough to define a person, a promise given to Catherine, that he would return to fetch her, has become his only purpose. Their love was so strong that has transcended time, place, every single of the many imposed boundaries of human civilization-like the sanctity of marriage, friendship, and transcended even death itself. And, then comes the greatest irony in this film:Almasy, a Hungarin count, a devoted servant of his majesty the Queen,an international bastard,captured in the desert by a British soldier, accused to be a German,helps the Germans by giving them the British maps, becomes, at the end, The English Patient-defined entirely by a nationality not his own. I could not help but feel sympathetic with this extraordinary character portrayed beautifully by Ralph Fiennes, even though I knew that the story was told completely from his point of view, and that he has let me see only a small portion of his rich inner world. I could go on for hours praising this film.All I wanted to say is that from its opening scene, with the lovely image of a brush painting something ,we cannot make out what at first, with that haunting melody of a beautiful androgynous voice lamenting a Hungarian lullaby in the background, to the breathtaking scenery, exceptional acting, outstanding directing-to the very end, is, to put it simply- PERFECT.

I will not try to tackle the historical background of this film because that is just not me. This review is based on my feelings alone. Every time I see Fiennes in this film, I cry. He is just beautiful. He reluctantly begins a love affair with a gorgeous married woman in the desert. They soon become very involved with each other, hiding their affair from her husband (Colin Firth). The love scenes between the two in this film are so passionate and overwhelming that one must hold one's breath and watch several times to take the emotional ecstasy in. I also cry during the parts of the film when his nurse is taking care of him and ultimately over medicates him so he can die in peace. She is beautiful too. I believe she has great love for him and also for what he has lost. She is in love with the mystery of the man dying on his sick bed. The scene where Fiennes carries his lover out of the cave after she has passed is just devastating. He goes through a personal hell to try and save her only to find that she has expired after his return. This film is riveting during every second. I'm glad I didn't see this in a theater.

Very sad and moving drama that tells a passionate love story, the film is a mixture of many things: the Nazis bad, war, survival, desert adventure, eroticism, exoticism, the 'figurative art and landscapes visually very beautiful. The movie also has many advantages among which is the assembly: the assembly of this film is very special because it has a very slow pace is in the movies that deal with love stories this is crucial, because this arrangement allows the viewer to live the love story in all its beauty, but also in all its bitterness. Another advantage is undoubtedly the interpretation of the actors Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas are very good, then there's the soundtrack that matches perfectly to the situation and to finish the script, which is very interesting and engaging and above all very simplified compared to the novel. But as in all the movies there are defects, one of which is the setting, as I said the sets are visually very beautiful but their reconstruction makes them seem fake. This movie I recommend it to all those who adore love stories very dramatic, but if you love the action and like Tarantino this film does not recommend it, you'll get bored to death. From my point of view this film is not a masterpiece but it is definitely a good movie so I give him a 7 because although I'm not a lover of love stories I still managed to like it. Awarded with 9 Academy Awards 1997: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, Best Editing, Best Sound, Best Costume Design, Best Soundtrack.",The English Patient
371,argento88,A film that takes a lot of time to go no where....,2,4 February 2005,"It was a real disappointment. There is no better way to put it. I have been know to be a harsh reviewer of things but this film does not deserve such strong words. It simply was a let down. Long, dull, and slow are some of the words that best describe the English Patient (which I think should be entitled ""The Patient English""). This film followed the story of several uninteresting characters who didn't do very much in an exceptionally long amount of time. It was supposed to ""revolve"" around the relationships of the various characters. It did revolve around the characters but the characters were of no interesting sort. This film had no particular ""flair"" about it either. One person compared it to Casablanca. That should be a sin. Casablanca is a classic, alone in its own class. This film is a C Grade Horror compared to Casablanca.If there were any further comment needed, it would be that this film will probably appeal to women rather than men.",The English Patient

The greatest trait of this movie I think is the genuine dialogue. Outstanding perfomance by Fiennes.There are some two dimensional characters, but I loved how Madox's character was a fundamental piece. The story has a lot of sentiment and touchy moments but this will not be remembered as one of those movie when you cry your heart out at the end.

I seriously think Oscar for the best picture for TEP was one of the biggest misses ever (but then Titanic followed, so it's to fear that things are going from bad to worse...). Anyway, what defines me in the first place is not gender and continent but the fact that I've seen many films in my life - and I don't mean Hollywood fast food but European and alternative production, the so-called art film. Thus I can claim that what TEP intended (and failed), Lars Von Trier fully developed in Breaking the Waves. Now, THERE you have tangible characters and love that breathes, leaving you speechless for hours after. TEP looks like a one-dimensional poor relative of Breaking the Waves. But then, what happens? Waves are not even nominated while TEP steals the cream... Hollywood patient?",The English Patient

And I've discovered a new trend--every time I like a movie for its depth, its intelligence, and its refusal to bow to normal Hollywood mediocrity, it seems that other IMDB reviewers HATE it.I read Ondaatje's novel several years ago, before it was made into a movie, and was absolutely enthralled.  It's turned into one of those books that I can devour over and over again, finding new things every time.  So I was thrilled to hear that it was going to be made into a film.Like everyone else, the first thing I noticed about the film was the incredible cinematography.  This was the first movie ever that made me want to go to the desert.  But then I found myself drawn in by the characters. I found Almasy and Katherine to be truly tragic figures...yes, they sinned, but look how they were punished for it in the end.  I found the movie to be a very powerful reminder of how situations can spiral out of control.  I wonder whether they were able to find peace with themselves.I do wish that they had shown more of the relationship between Hana and Kip. I felt that had that been developed more, the parallels between that relationship and the one between Almasy and Katherine would have added another level of dimension to the film.

Ok, so the cinematography was good and visually it's pretty impressive - very WEAK motives to withstand 160 minutes of torture. Not even the acting was worth it! I found myself looking constantly at my watch and the only reason I didn't leave about 1 hour into the movie was because I went to see it with a group of other people. And guess what? - when we got out, I found out that EVERY ONE OF THEM was thinking the same!
I've read some comments on this movie, explaining in great detail what it is that makes it 'One of the Greatest'... one of these comments was almost as long as the movie itself. A word to those people: if a movie has to be explained so thoroughly to be enjoyed, it's because it's crap! Although it's true that, nowadays, most films provide easy answers to easy questions and a little 'depth' is welcome, this is deffinetly NOT the way to achieve it - 'The English Patient' wasn't deep.

383,ade_romero,My favorite movie,10,24 February 2000,"The first time I saw TEP was in a cold winter day in Quebec, and when I left the theater I felf I wanted to cry. Yes, because during 2 and half hours I was very far away from that city and submerged in a beautiful world of passions, tragedies and love. The English Patient became my favorite movie ever, because it took me to places in time and space in a way no movie had before. Every character in this movie is complex and human, they mirror life and how some events can change our life forever. What I like most of these movie is how elegantly made it is, and how technically perfect is too. I've seen this movie a good 20 times,and every time I see it I discover new things in it, different motivations for it's characters new small hidden sounds to make a scene perfect. I can say that the relationship between The Count and Katherine is a very despicable one, they are selfish and impulsive, but again that's what we, the public like the most: Big passions, irresistibles ones. I love this movie too because it's a nostalgic trip,everybody here wants to go back to their formal self. Hanna,The Count, Caravaggio, Kip even Katherine, and sometimes in real life there's is this need to go back, to be how we were before. Besides, the music is one of the most inspiring ones i've ever heard in a film, blending beautifully with extremely perfect shots of the desert and of The Villa. The acting is subtle and controlled, just with small gestures Kristin S. Thomas commands the scenes she's in. Since this movie I want to see every movie with her. I recommend this movie to everybody who has ever wanted to go back in time so badly that it hurts. The perfect movie for the real romantics.",The English Patient
384,dohanlon_ie,This is a gloriously 'Artsy' film,10,8 July 2000,"Previous comments have questioned the Academy's choice in this film, given its imdb rating and mediocre showing at the box office. But wasn't that the point. This movie was an adult themed, classically acted movie which was aimed at liberal, middleclass people between 25 and 40. This is a difficult demographic to attract successfully. The Academy is supposed to choose a film for its merit, not its popularity! Otherwise the whole thing becomes defunct. Also I think it has to be acknowledged that success and merit are not necessarily the same thing.I am certainly not trying to contradict the other viewers opinions, I just think that they need clarification. 'The English Patient' was not 'Titanic', it didn't come stamed with blockbuster all over it. As to its IMDB rating, the film was one of the least seen Oscar winners in years, due to the reasons outlined above, therefore its mean average is lightely to be lower, although it is above the ordinary. Also as a forethought, this movie did better abroad than in the US, in Europe it was phenomenal due to Binoche, in the UK Fiennes and Scott-Thomas. Other popular European movies have low ratings because the majority of vistors to this site are english speaking and from the USWhat Im saying is that it is wrong to categorise this, or any other movie, within the confines of any other, that is quite different to comparison. Finally, was this movie as amazing as some portrayed it. no, but it was sure a better movie than Titanic or Shakespeare in Love.",The English Patient

Oh, the woman is married to another, less attractive man!  Well, she should hook up with the German guy who HAS NO PERSONALITY.  I see.  We love this because it is ROMANTIC.  I am sorry but romance to me is either between married people or single people.  I find this type of movie (along with Bridges of Madison County) to send the wrong message to everybody.

386,kashpunj,"good performances, story a bit dry and slow",7,9 July 2007,"When this film first came out, I remember it being a phenomenon, especially with women. Literally, there were women who watched it a dozen times in theatres. For some reason, I never watched it until this year and I must say that I found myself underwhelmed by certain aspects of the movie. Though the movie is solid and above average, I can't imagine why the committee decided to give it NINE Oscars. On the whole, the movie does deserve heaps of praise for the cinematography and overall direction. The vistas of North Africa and Tuscan Italy of the WWII era are wonderfully captured. In addition, the performances of Ralph Fiennes, Juliette Binoche, and Willem Dafoe are standout. However, the movie lags and moves SLOWLY. I watched this with my family and we almost popped the DVD out after the first half hour. However, once the story gets going it will rarely let go. Also, if you are anathema to movies about the power and tragedy of love (aka chick flick material) then steer clear, it will not convince you otherwise about the genre. Some of the dialogue made me cringe and question if some of the scenes were adapted ideally from the book.Overall, the movie is still solid and most people will find something to like here.

398,Rommel,A masterpiece,10,21 December 1999,"The first thing that struck me about this movie was the beautiful depiction of the love story between Katherine and Almazy. In most love movies, the main characters seem to fall in love simply because they are in the same movie and their love is usually depicted by them running laughing somewhere outside. In TEP the 2 main characters are characterized with a lot of depth to their personalities so it is easy to see why they are attracted to each other. Furthermore the dialogue between them is simply sparkling with intelligence.The plot is very logically structured. At first viewing I was a bit put off by the tragic ending, but on further viewings I realized that the ending was perfectly integrated with the rest of the movie.Of course the cinematography is absolutely beautiful as well as the accompanying music.Many commenters complain about the acting being ""wooden"". I find it hard to understand that we are talking about the same movie. I have very rarely seen a movie where the personalities of the characters were so well depicted.There are lots of fine details that will keep you thinking about the movie. One of my favorite scenes is the campfire in the desert where the explorers take turns performing. Katherine is very well contrasted to her dull husband who just sings a silly song about bananas, whereas she tells a greek myth, where her husband and Almazy are metaphorized.A perfect 10 in my opinion.",The English Patient

I thought that Anthony Minghella's script and its structure were excellent especially considering the complexity of the original novel.  In the end I realise that not everyone can appreciate a film but I feel that a lot of people did not fully grasp the complexity of this story.  So many films now are made without containing any kind of depth or worthwhile story and although they are often very entertaining, it was refreshing to watch a film which did not insult its audience's intelligence and simply told a story without feeling the need to include token special effects.  I also have to say that I gain something from and understand something more about this film every time I watch it, due to the strength of its story.  It is true that this film is extremely sad but I found that it acted as a catharsis.  It has also been accused of immorality but in my opinion it is naive to think that love is always warm and happy.  The destructive, overpowering nature of the relationship between the Count and Katharine was exactly what fascinated me so much in this film and what continues to reduce me to tears every time I watch it.

When you hear that a movie is so wonderful for so long and then you finally see that movie, it can be a disappointment.

But when everything comes together, is about a piece of art what we're talking about. I think this is the case. From the first glance, this film is breathtaking. The mesmerizing soundtrack and the beautiful and evocative images bring an atmosphere so sugestive that you will fall in love in a moment. Let's be honest: what do we look for when we go to a theater to see a movie? One good story, the one we should have live, and some images to be remembered at the end of the day... or for a lifetime. I am by no means romantic, at least I dont go to cinema ""looking for a movie to cry with"", but believe me, the English Patient turns you into a state of sensibility that makes you realize the beauty of feelings, not only the happy ones, but the sad ones too. I mean, true great stories are the ones that contain a mix of feelings and facts (adventure, romanticism, sadness, action) that makes you breathe deeply and say that's life, and that's beautiful.",The English Patient

This film directly addresses the issues of love and death, as do most meaningful artistic projects. The characterisation and casting are just about perfect, and the narrative remains plausible throughout.

Having read almost all comments to this film I must realize that people do love or do hate this film. There seems to be almost nothing in between. I loved this film. The photography, the actors, the deepness of the characters and the story. All this made a fabulous film which tells you much about the essence of human life. And on wonder this film got 9 Oscars. Believe it or not, this was the main reason, why I came to see this film only now. It seemed to me to be very much in the tradition of David Lean Films. I had to think of Trevor Howard and Celia Johnson in Leans ""Brief Encounter"". But in TEP the story goes much further. Go and experience this extraordinary Film! A Film you will not forget, if...... see above. A ""10"" for this masterpiece.",The English Patient

I walked out of the theater wondering why I'd stayed to see all of it (and decided that I had because for all of the (deserved) awards it won, surely the story would get better. It didn't.) I know there are fine actors and actresses, photographers, musicians, etc., and this film did display their talent as individuals. When all was said, done, and viewed, unfortunately, the viewer was simply left with a void.

I would also be interested to know what the location of the desert shooting is as well. Travel extensively in Europe and Africa and would am interested in visiting the areas that the book and film were about. Please e-mail me with any information on the sites that any one might have.

419,sanabuttniazi,"One of my favourite films, will never understand the hate.",10,22 May 2020,"The cinematography is gorgeous, every shot looks like a painting. The score is understated and haunting and Marta Sebestyen's rendition of Sezerelem is just beautiful. The script was very well written, it felt poetic yet very natural. The story is incredibly layered and subtle, I have watched it a number of times now and I always notice something new. The scenes and character arcs in North Africa and Italy parallel each other very well.
One common complaint I have heard about this film is that the characters are unlikeable. I didn't really think so. Almassy's surly persona feels like a front. He likes to imagine himself to be a rational and practical man, hence the whole writing papers without using any adjectives nonsense, but in reality he is hot headed, impulsive and passionate, and this aspect of himself comes out when he falls for a woman who is very similar in this regard. Their self absorption is ultimately their downfall. He feels like a much warmer person in the scenes in Italy, as though his ordeal has humbled him somewhat and taught him to pay more attention to those around him, he takes interest in Hannah's affairs in a way he neglected to when he was with the likes of Maddox.
Katherine's relationship with her husband is a complex one. She loves him as a friend and Almassy as a lover. ""Romantic Love and Platonic Love are quite different things"". She does not wish to hurt him, but as Clifton mentions in an obliviously triumphant way, she has basically settled for a man who she has always viewed as a friend and she ends up breaking his heart when she meets a man that she actually has feelings for. It's a good cautionary tale for ""nice guys"" who are desperate to get out of the friend zone. Clifton makes every attempt to put her on display and tempt fate by leaving her alone in the desert with Almassy, in spite of his protestations, so I can only feel so sorry for him, her wondering off was inevitable given the circumstances.
Another common complaint is that his switching allegiance to the Nazis, being justified by Love was dodgy. Put yourself in his shoes. Imagine the one person you care about in all the world is slowly dying a painful death in the middle of nowhere, you've been walking for days looking for help, when you finally find the ""good guys"" in the war, they treat you like dirt mock your name and arrest you and cart you away, and all the while your beloved is left to die, they've effectively murdered that person through their ignorance. Are you seriously telling me you'd be noble and put the war effort first if you'd been through all that? Most normal people are not that self sacrificing, almost everyone would do the same thing in the circumstances, especially if they were desperate and still thought that they had a chance of saving their loved one.
Most of the complaints levelled at this film are not in my opinion justified and are mostly the result of people not paying attention to the film.
And if you think that anything that's unabashedly romantic is soppy, then that's just your problem.",The English Patient

A wooden flame, some food, a pen and a note book beside her bed and burning faith in her mind that,her love,Almasy will come back and rescue her.

The English Patient begins with the amazing avion shots of a battered english Tiger Moth flying high over the rippling dunes of Africa. He's got some babe wrapped up in a parachute in the front seat(Tiger Moth's had a pilots seat in the rear.)Guess what happens next? Bam! He's shot out of the sky and burnt all up to a crisp. Right about then I said to myself,""Who cares?"" This pathetic story of a burnt up man lags for hours, each second you feel that there may be a point- a point that never comes!

As cruel as that might seem, you pray to the movie gods for some justice to be served out on perhaps two of the most selfish people you've ever met.Here we have a war raging around them, and they only seem concerned about their happiness and how they can steal away moments with one another so they can begin fornicating.If you're a fan of overly elaborate movies with little substance with an overlong length which tell a story of two selfish pigs who you could really care less about.

The original cut of the movie was 4 hours and 10 minutes long, so 2 hours and 45 minutes is not all that bad. Besides, the viewer would not have received the impact that movie was trying to make in an hour and a half. So please stop writing stupid shitty comments and at least give a legitimate reason why the movie was not good. A comment such as ""we didn't even know why the people were in the desert...or how they even met"" is retarded.

I felt like my brain was being sucked out of my head. Horrendous. This is number one on my personal ""worst film"" list. The only part that left any impression on me at all was the part which I couldn't bear to watch (the part about the ""fingers"").

I kept the snack stand in business that night, as I was looking for excuses to take a break from the movie. One bag of Red Vines and a giant popcorn later, well, yes...the movie still sucked. You could hear the pretension in the theater when the beast ended: ""Wow! What a film. They don't make them like that anymore."" Or, ""Such a study of human complexity.

It is a classy, flawless, excellent quality film- one of those that truly help to define the process of movie-making as ""art."" Each cast member was fully enveloped in his/her character, and I felt as if I was observing a real occurrence from a hidden place. The chemistry between each and every character on the screen was incredible; most of the time, dialogue was not even needed- the expressions on the actors' faces showed exactly what was happening within themselves, and between one another.

Willem Dafoe could also have done a Montreal accent and why David, (English) and Carraviggio, Italian ? Where all those flashbacks really necessary?

The story isn't the main draw of the film (there are countless sad love stories in Hollywood each year, but not every one wins an Oscar). What is so captivating of the film is its pacing, and it is easy to understand why it appeals more to older people and to those who watch the film more than once. Fiennes always is a solid presence in films, taking the movies from good film to classic. The movie touches on the points of WWII that we don't always see, from Kip the demolitions expert to Hana the nurse (a well played role).

Overall, the story is good, dialogues above average, although not excellent. I personally think you'll remember this movie more by what you see than what you hear. Very well worth the time spent watching. Binoche saves the day in that movie, as others mentioned already, but on a visual point of view, many other experts also did a wonderful job.

446,Einsatzkommando-Monkey,Unbearable Saccharine Schlock,1,12 January 2008,"Anthony Minghella's The English Patient (1996) shows us that Hollywood was capable beautiful pieces of art even before they started re-making classics circa 2000. Rather than refer to the director or the cast as separate entities, I would rather refer to them as a hideous amorphous blob known as ""krug103"", because as we all know, dehumanizing people is the best way to get them to shut up.Based on (plot-wise) the mind-shattering post-modern poetic novel by Michael Ondaantje, the heart and soul of the author's work is raped and humiliated by the big screen until it cries for death. What we get, instead of a character study of deeply insightful, 10-dimensional characters, is a romanticized dick-fest of Ralph Fiennes and what's-her-face(whoever played The English Patient's love interest) hamming up the screen with their unimportant love story.Some may consider it bad form to not even attempt to figure out the whore's name, but people who focus on the Patient and his affair, such as the director, are morons who completely missed the point of the novel. Another mistake the director made was turning Hana, Kip, and Caravaggio into 1-dimensional characters with absolutely no purpose in the movie but to listen to The Patient's story and make puppy-dog faces.One would assume that after reading the poetic verses, and fully absorbing the bleak outlook of the novel, that the atmosphere would easily come to a creative director who would translate the dead atmosphere of the book to a visual journey into the psyches of those affected by the war, but instead we get a myopic excuse for a film that seems like the director had a creative writing class in high school taught by a complete idiot who photo-copies digest magazines in his spare time between marking perfects on assignments of people who he favours and watching lame sci-fi shows.The utter carelessness and lack of attention towards the main themes of the novel, and the failure to present the deep characters and glorious atmosphere of the novel is so anger-inducing that i'm barely able to write a coherent review. It makes me reminisce about a creative writing teacher who would probably go to this movie and enjoy every moment of it because of its ability to adhere to the ""10 steps to directing a good movie"" crap that the establishment tries to feed people because they're too damn dumb to think beyond affairs, love and romance.If I could rate this lower than a 1 I'd probably go into imaginary numbers or decimals. Avoid at all costs.",The English Patient
447,sabre_nc,Tirelessly tireless,2,1 January 2015,"This movie is not a masterpiece. This movie is not a classic. This is a dull story about beautiful people who have no character or depth. It is far too long and lacking in interest to be good. The movie shows you the end in the first few scenes so there is no suspense or intrigue, just a predictable, slow, plodding, incessant march to the already known pointless ending.On the plus side the cinematography is exquisite and the director makes the desert look alluring as well as deadly. Far better as a National Geographic pictorial of N. Africa than any love story. Like a Seinfeld character said, ""Die already."" Don't waste your time.",The English Patient
448,kevspence,Top 5 of All Time,10,2 February 2007,"This movie has everything from heartbreaking romance and betrayal to mischievous desire and amusement. The cinematography is literally breathtaking. My favourite aspect of this film is how the segues were managed and implemented. The audio and visual overlapping from scene to scene is some of the best art I've witnessed. In my humble opinion, this movie is about the different levels of love and grief, plus the different facets of love and grief. Who can judge true love? How does one cope after the death of a loved one, both literal and emotional? It is also quite clearly a study in prejudice and how we judge a book by its cover more often than not. In the end, it's no wonder this film was given so many accolades. The screenplay adaptation, the direction, the cinematography and the depth of character shown in the lead roles, combined with a sweeping, haunting score make this a definite for my personal top 5 films of all time.",The English Patient
449,WeeBubba,Boring???,10,14 August 2005,"i cant understand why people say this film is boring.it may not have many special effects and action sequences, but most of the action films i've seen recently have kinda left me feeling a bit bored towards the end. war of the worlds, for example. great effects - but i started to get that familiar empty 'been there, done that' feeling towards the end.i want to see films that have real meaning and soul. films that you remember. I'm not well up on technical aspects such as screenplay structure, but for me, the English patient is one of those films that is like a rare gem.",The English Patient

451,nakshirwany,"Review of ""The English Patient""",10,16 August 2005,"Michael Ondaatje's novel (of the same name and on which the movie is based) is not the most visual of books. It is an obtuse story, yet haunting in detail, mesmerizing in its depth. Minghella brings it to the screen perfectly capturing its entire emotional content. I recall gripping the armrest of my seat almost from that drifting opening image of a biplane flying over the sensuous ripples of desert sand interspersed with shots of a hand painstakingly drawing primitive human figures with a calligraphist's brush. I was hooked and knew in those moments that this was going to be a special treat.The movie's story is not convoluted. Nevertheless, it appears veiled. The many layers of narrative are initially hidden and are then gently and beautifully revealed. This narrational unfolding could be the re-assembling of the tortured memory of its central protagonist, Count Almasy (possibly Ralph Fiennes finest portrayal), a badly burnt, dying young man who is being cared for by a French-Canadian Allied nurse, Hana (wonderfully nuanced performance by that elegant French actress, Juliette Binoche). He lies in a large bed that seems to accentuate his frail and damaged body. This is a makeshift nursing station in an abandoned Italian monastery put together by Hana. She has volunteered to separate from her medical unit because her charge is too ill to travel further. Who is her patient? Is he English? We don't initially know. Between the Count's morphine induced ramblings and some clarity afforded by the mysterious Carvaggio (very effective turn by Willem Dafoe) who descends on this desolate pair, we begin to learn Almasy's identity and the pieces begin to fall into place. An epic tale unfolds, some from the patient's faltering memory and others from the accusative probings of Carvaggio. It is an epic tale of an obsessive forbidden romance between Almasy and Katherine Clifton, the unfulfilled wife of his Royal Geographic Expedition colleague. We are never sure of where all this takes place. It must be the Middle Eastern desert. But exactly where? Even though we are geographically lost, we know the approximate temporal position of the story. World War II is waging. Somewhere in the expanse of a great desert, perhaps in North Africa, archaeologists (Almasy being one of them) hunt for something. That something is never central to the narrative. How Almasy meets Katherine and is engulfed and convulsed by his intense attraction to her, is. They meet, they love and just as they happen to touch the highest bliss of consummation, a torrent of events deeply incises their union.It is compelling to think that this movie is a metaphor for something. It is full of so many exquisite images and so many literary underpinnings. I believe that it is like a Greek tragedy, crushing in it's impact, embodying a deep sense of where it unfolds. In this case the irony of a Hungarian nobleman, mistaken for being English because his accent is British. The irony that he is cared for a young woman growing to love his pain, his command of facts, his quotations from Herodutus, his notes scribbled on wrinkled inserts in books that allude to his affair that is so intense that she is envious of it. In some ways, the movie is about two romances. The first is the intense physical one that resides in the English Patients memory. The second is what transpires between her and her dying patient, grotesquely burnt and unrecognizable. In that sense, The English Patient is a metaphor for how war can tear away innocence and replace it with a weary wisdom, soon to vanish",The English Patient
452,waynecalifornia,The English Patient...,10,5 September 2005,"The English Patient reminds me of a modern day ""Casablanca"" in that it accurately portrayed the intense personal conflicts of World War II.I like the line ""I do this because I am a nurse.""This is a great movie and reveals the absolute madness of war and the struggle for humanity during military conflicts.I also liked the way the story weaved in and out between flashbacks and the present. The beginning with the art drawn on a cave wall reminds me of the scene in ""American Beauty"" when the leaves were dancing on the street- very artistic and classy.It is also very interesting to me that the concept of ""ownership"" in a relationship shifted from the theoretical to the practical, in that once lovers become emotionally attached to each other, they expect more from each other and need a feeling of belonging and being ""special.""",The English Patient
