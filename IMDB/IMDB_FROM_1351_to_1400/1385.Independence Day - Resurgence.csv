0,TheLittleSongbird,Falls rapidly downhill after the opening,2,2 October 2016,"While not really a fan of the original 'Independence Day', it is a masterpiece compared to the mess that 'Independence Day: Resurgence' is. The film does suffer from ""sequeltitis"", but in all honesty it is the sort of film that falls spectacularly on its own terms.Granted 'Independence Day: Resurgence' does look great, with a slick and sleek look to it without being too much of either and the special effects are surprisingly impressive, especially in the opening. Speaking of the opening, that was a very promising start to the film, it was spectacularly destructive and was the most exciting the entire film ever got. When watching the opening, there was the thought ""maybe this sequel may turn out sort of alright after all"". Sad that that was not the case.Unfortunately, 'Independence Day: Resurgence' rapidly runs out of steam after that promising beginning. Roland Emmerich delivers reliably at the start but the rest of the direction is phoned-in and lazy. Another big problem is the story, or shall we say lack of it. There are times where it does try to cram in too much but most of the time it lacks thrills, excitement or suspense and replaced by dullness and stupidity with scenes that are unnecessary or go nowhere. There is absolutely no emotional investment either, the only emotion most viewers, including me, will feel is stone-cold boredom.Outside of the opening, the rest of the action and storytelling is like an underpowered damp squib and instantly forgettable at best. Attempts at drama are mawkish and forced. Characterisation is next to zero, with all the characters either being paper thin or annoying, sometimes even both.The script is weak by any standards, and often even worse, with a lot of misplaced and unfunny attempts at humour that comes over as juvenile or stilted gibberish. The music is unmemorable and instead of rousing it's like a dirge-like drone or overbears everything. The acting from capable actors, disadvantaged by material so bad from many (such as Brent Spiner), give career-worst performances.In summary, starts promisingly but runs out of steam fast. 2/10 Bethany Cox",Independence Day - Resurgence
1,SnoopyStyle,invaded by characters I don't care about,4,16 July 2016,"It's 20 years after the first attack. The world has been at peace as it prepares for the expected next invasion. The Earth Space Defense (ESD) is adapting the alien technology for its defense. David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) is in Africa. With Dr. Catherine Marceaux (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and warlord Dikembe Umbutu, they endeavor to decipher the alien language. Umbutu and former U.S. President Thomas Whitmore (Bill Pullman) have a psychic connection with the aliens. Elizabeth Lanford (Sela Ward) is the new president. Patricia Whitmore (Maika Monroe) is an aide, former pilot, and fiancée to present pilot Jake Morrison (Liam Hemsworth). Dr Brakish Okun (Brent Spiner) wakes up from his 20 year coma. Dylan Dubrow-Hiller (Jessie Usher) is a new pilot and the son of the hero Steven Hiller who died in a training accident after the first movie. Joshua Adams (William Fichtner) is the general in charge of ESD. Julius Levinson (Judd Hirsch) is estranged from David and selling his book ""How I Saved The World"".The original has fun charismatic characters. The difference in this one is that the new characters are not compelling played by actors with less charisma. They don't have time to develop. The only compelling characters are from the original and that's because they build up the characters before. I don't want to say this but it misses Will Smith. Jessie Usher is not even a shadow of Big Willie. Liam Hemsworth is Liam Hemsworth. There isn't more to say about that. Mae Whitman is replaced with the hotter Maika Monroe. The returning Goldblum has a couple of fun lines and he tries to bring some needed humor. Judd Hirsch is driving a bunch of kids for some reason. Bill Pullman has grown a beard and has a lesser speech to make. As for Brent Spiner, I thought he got killed in the first movie. There is plenty of action and a lot of CGI stuff. It would be popcorn fun if the characters are more than cardboard cut-outs. This ends trying to set up for an interstellar space war franchise. That's probably the final nail. It's obvious that Roland Emmerich is more concerned about building the cinematic world than making one great sequel.",Independence Day - Resurgence
2,Hitchcoc,Dull and Confusing,4,28 July 2017,"I thought the first film was cornball, but it had some great lines from the likes of Jeff Goldblum, Randy Quaiid, and Will Smith. It also was a simple bad alien versus the Red, White, and Blue. First of all, this is about as dull as any big film I've seen. Nothing much happens in the first half of the film. We are given little human interest stories and romantic encounters. Some of the original cast have come back. For some reason, Judd Hirsch hasn't changed in 20 years. Then there are the hot shots who are going to save the world. Tiresome stereotypes. Finally, how they subdue these guys never makes any sense because what their vulnerabilities are are never made clear. What a waste of two hours.",Independence Day - Resurgence
3,Prismark10,They're back,6,12 May 2017,"The trouble with Independence Day: Resurgence is that the sequel was released after 20 years from the original film and really there was no need for it.Minus Will Smith we have another alien threat 20 years later and earth is a different place after harnessing the alien technology they encountered.From the first film we have Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman, Judd Hirsch, Brent Spiner and Vivica Fox. I found Spiner's character irritating in the first film and here he is some kind of wacky Doc Brown character used mainly for comic relief.Of the new cast Liam Hemsworth, Maika Monroe, Jesse T Usher are bland compared to say veterans like William Fichtner.However despite a not very original plot and also some not very good CGI, I found the film cheesy fun and we get destruction of landmarks, mayhem and plenty of stupidity. At least we do not get Apple Macs interfacing with alien technology.",Independence Day - Resurgence
4,claudio_carvalho,"Lame Story, Silly Characters, Ridiculous Dialogues, Great CGI",5,6 August 2016,"The 1996 ""Independence Day"" is a funny and entertaining film of alien invasion despite the silly melodramatic subplots. But every fan of sci-fi genre certainly watched this movie. The 2016 sequel raised great expectations in the fans. But it should have never been made. The story of an alien arrival to destroy the planet twenty years after the unsuccessful invasion is lame. The characters are silly and the dialogues and situations are ridiculous. Eleven guys writing the story and screenplay probably for morons so stupid most of the situations and jokes are. In the end, only the great CGI is worthwhile watching; the rest may be forgotten. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Independence Day: O Ressurgimento"" (""Independence Day: Resurgence"")",Independence Day - Resurgence
5,nogodnomasters,You have the heart of a warrior,6,31 October 2017,"It is 19 years later. The aliens return bigger and better, but the Earth is rebuilt using alien technology.Will Smith is not in this film, so they killed him off as a test pilot and his son Dylan (Jessie T. Usher) has no sense of humor. Mom (Vivica A. Fox) is back for what amounts to a cameo and is no longer a pole dancer. They did resurrect Dr. Brakish Okun (Brent Spiner) who apparently wasn't killed by the alien behind the glass. Bill Pullman returns as the retired President who initially comes off as senile. His daughter (Maika Monroe) is also a pilot.The hot shot maverick pilot is Liam Hemsworth pretending to be Tom Cruise, but coming off more like Val Kilmer.The story feels superficial. It was not iconic like the first one which built great characters we all loved and slowly went into the action. In this episode, the idea to harvest the earth's life and elements has changed to taking its core, something they could be doing to uninhabited planets. Pac-man is on our side and this leads to a sequel...if they decide to make it. Maybe they can find a way to knock off Liam Hemsworth and resurrect Will Smith. Liam Hemsworth was a bad casting choice, not Jesse Eisenberg- Lex Luthor bad, but a bad one nonetheless.Guide: Hot Asian chick- no personality either. Bad casting choices, bland dialogue",Independence Day - Resurgence
6,kosmasp,The bigger they are ...,3,23 February 2017,"You can take that to the bank and also take it literally. But yes, I don't think expectations were that high for a sequel to a movie from 20 years ago. And while I wouldn't consider myself the biggest Will Smith fan (acting wise that is), his (film) son should get back to (acting) school. And I hope he hasn't quit his day job yet ... I know that may sound mean, and maybe there is hope for him still, but charisma wise there was less than nothing on screen.But saying the movie didn't work because of one actor would be unfair. It's also the script, let's keep it real here. There are entertaining moments from time to time, especially when you recognize recurring characters (there are a couple of them and no the dog could not come back, I'm sorry!). But it also is riddled with a lot of mental and crazy things that are just too much. Or you'll love the whole wink wink, the world is ending but we're making dad and son jokes kind of vibe. I for one and apparently a lot of others did not approve ...",Independence Day - Resurgence
7,jboothmillard,Independence Day: Resurgence,3,28 June 2016,"It had been twenty years since Razzie nominated director Roland Emmerich (Stargate, Godzilla, The Day After Tomorrow, White House Down) made the worldwide disaster movie smash, then Hollywood decided ""We always knew they were coming back"". Did we? Well, it happened. Basically it has twenty years since Earth was attacked by aliens in 1996, since then the advanced alien technology salvaged has been encompassed into everyday life, and the United Nations have created ESD (Earth Space Defense), Earth's early warning system, with military forces stationed on the Moon, Mars and Rhea (the second-largest moon of Saturn), and Area 51 is ESD headquarters. In Africa, ESD Director David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) is lead to an intact alien destroyer, by scientist Dr. Catherine Marceaux (Nymphomaniac's Charlotte Gainsbourg) and warlord Dikembe Umbutu (Deobia Oparei), the ship was drilling a hole, and before their defeat the aliens sent a distress call to their home planet. A spherical spaceship emerges from a wormhole near the Moon, Levinson is convinced it is a different extraterrestrial race, he urges the world's governments not to attack, but they vote to shoot it down regardless, ESD pilot Jake Morrison (Liam Hemsworth), against orders, picks up Levinson, Marceaux, Umbutu, and accountant Floyd Rosenberg (Nicolas Wright) to take them to the crash site. After Levinson and his team recover a container, suddenly a gigantic alien mother ship suddenly emerges, destroys Earth's planetary defences before approaching the planet, the tug manages to escape the gravitational pull, and the team watch as structures from parts of Asia are lifted, and the debris falls across Europe, all is destroyed. The mother ship lands over northern Atlantic Ocean, drilling a hole in the middle of the ocean to harvest the heat of the core, which in the process will destroy Earth's magnetic field, President Elizabeth Lanford (Razzie nominated Sela Ward) and many of her Cabinet are killed when aliens raid the Cheyenne Mountain Complex, Cabinet official General Joshua Adams (William Fichtner) as sworn as the new President. Eccentric Dr. Brakish Okun (Brent Spiner) has awoken from his twenty year coma, since the new invasion began, he has been experiencing recurring visions of extraterrestrial logograms, alongside Umbutu, and former President Thomas J. Whitmore (Bill Pullman), who predicted the aliens were coming back. Okun opens the container and releases a giant sphere of artificial intelligence; its mission is to evacuate survivors from worlds targeted by harvesters, and to build a resistance force, and Whitmore interrogates an alien kept in captivity since the last war, the ESD learns the alien queen is coming. They believe if they destroy the alien queen, her attendants will retreat from the planet, Captain Dylan Dubrow-Hiller (Jessie T. Usher), stepson of now- deceased war hero Steve Hiller (killed in a flight test), leads a squadron to stage a counterattack to destroy the queen, they are caught in a trap by the mother ship, but Dylan, Jake, and fellow pilots Charlie Ritter (Travis Tope) and Rain Lao (Angelababy) escape. The queen becomes aware of the presence of the A.I. sphere, it wants the ESD to destroy the queen to prevent it learning its secrets, the ESD hide the sphere in an isolation chamber, an copy its signal in a transmitter to lure the queen's warship into a trap, with nuclear weapons. Against the wishes of his daughter Patricia (Maika Monroe), Whitmore volunteers a suicide mission to detonate the bombs, sacrificing himself and destroying the ship, however the queen survives using an energy shield. In the end however Patricia flies a hybrid fighter, the queen's shield is penetrated, allowing Dylan's team to kill the queen before it reaches the sphere, following the queen's death the mother ship stops drilling and retreats from Earth, Okun reveals the sphere has asked to lead a resistance, and new technology it offers can help them prepare for an assault on the aliens' home planet. Also starring Judd Hirsch as Julius Levinson, Vivica A. Fox as Jasmine Hiller, Joey King as Sam, Patrick St. Esprit as Secretary of Defense Tanner and Robert Loggia (in his final film, before dying of Alzheimer's disease) as General Grey. Goldblum, Pullman and Hirsch are still relatively likaeble returning to their roles, and Hemsworth is okay as the new leading hero, it's a shame Will Smith turned down $50 million to appear in two films, on the other hand, maybe it was for the best. Like many revivals of massive movies, this one is a bit of a flop, the special effects are brilliant, with skyscrapers taken from the ground and dropped like matchsticks, including the destruction of London, and the alien creatures running about and fight sequences are fine, but the story is very thin, the cliffhanger ending only means there will be another sequel (going intergalactic), if you really want to see landmarks being blown blown up it's fine, but overall it's a disappointing science-fiction adventure. It was nominated the Razzies Award for Worst Picture, Worst Screenplay and Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-Off or Sequel. Adequate!",Independence Day - Resurgence
8,paul_haakonsen,"Wait, haven't we seen this already back in 1996?...",6,24 September 2016,"Much can be said for the follow up to the 1996 Sci-Fi pseudo-classic ""Independence Day"". And I will start out by asking was this a necessary movie? No, not in the least. The legacy of the first movie stands well on its own without the contents of the 2016 sequel added to it. Why is that? Well, because this was essentially the same movie just refurbished into new presentation.With that being said, I am not saying that ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" is a bad movie. Not at all. Actually it is a very enjoyable action Sci-Fi movie, just forget all about it being a sequel to the original ""Independence Day"" movie and you will be alright.The effects are off the charts, as they should be for a Sci-Fi movie of this caliber to pass as believable and being effective. And the special effects and CGI team here really did quite well to bring about the vision of director Roland Emmerich.I found it nice that we go to see more of the aliens in this 2016 sequel, and that more of their technology was shown as well. And it was a nice touch to see that mankind had taken the technology in the aftermath of the 1996 incident and put it to good use. And the queen or hive-mother of the aliens was a nice touch as well.However, ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" is not without its flaws. And yes, there were a heap. First of all, the movie is just off to a really bad start when you realize that this is essentially exactly the same concept as the first movie. But the characters in the movie were rigid, wooden dolls trying to be humans. It was a tiring thing to witness that the characters were so generic to the point of being caricatures of the characters in the first movie.""Independence Day: Resurgence"" is by no means a movie that was necessary to witness the light of day. But since it did, then it was really a shame that the writers couldn't muster up a more original story and just fell back on blatantly copying the first movie.I am rating ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" six out of ten stars, based on the enjoyment level of the movie. And that is based on the action, the CGI and the adrenaline-rush that was ""Independence Day: Resurgence"", because the story was anything but impressive.",Independence Day - Resurgence
9,michaelRokeefe,The world must come together again to survive an alien attack.,5,19 January 2018,"It has been twenty years since the initial invasion of Earth by advanced extraterrestrials. The same foes are transported by a mothership twice the size as before. The world's armies seems to have been sitting on their collective hands because the only real defensive firepower is the same surviving armaments and alien technology left behind from the original attack. This time the attacking force is doubled, but hopefully still more primitive. Sequences of sci-fi destruction along with the same drama, storyline and director of the 2012 movie. Chances are that big action, special effects and loudness will sustain you. Needless to say, there is a very large cast that features: Liam Hemsworth, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, Maika Monroe, Jessie T. Usher, Sela Ward, Vivica A. Fox and Judd Hirsch.",Independence Day - Resurgence
10,Hey_Sweden,"Moderately amusing, at best.",5,6 January 2020,"The original over the top 1990s sci-fi / action blockbuster got itself this routinely (and ineptly) written sequel that purports to show us how the human race finally learned to get along after uniting against an extraterrestrial menace. Moreover, we've benefited from learning about their weapons and technology. The catch, of course, is that they've also had 20 years to prepare for another attack on us. A number of holdovers from the first movie - or their offspring - band together to launch a major offensive. They also get some help from an unexpected source.The bottom line is that if you HATED the first film, you'd probably loathe this follow-up even more. It has the same dumb, sappy character writing and laughably bad introductory sequences. Some of the scenes are just cringe-inducing, for example the ones with a resurrected Dr. Brakish Okun (Brent Spiner) as he fumbles about with a laser he invented and otherwise acts like a goofball. The Will Smith hero is replaced with his now grown-up son, Dylan (Jessie T. Usher), but other protagonists like ex-President Whitmore (Bill Pullman) make encore appearances.The sense of scale and the visual effects are pretty darn impressive - at least, as far as CGI goes, and director Roland Emmerich and company offer plenty of action. It's just hard to care all that much about whether this bunch of heroes save the world this time. To make matters worse, the five credited writers crib ideas from a certain other Fox franchise, since they obviously couldn't come up with good enough concepts of their own.The actors can't have been too happy about their sub-standard material, but likely the paychecks helped to make up for that to some degree. Some of the roles are pure cliches, such as the Liam Hemsworth character, a macho, risk-taking pilot, and his buddy Charlie (Travis Tope), a nerdy, hungry-for-love type. It's too bad Emmerich & his cohorts couldn't be bothered to really care about their characters. And if they couldn't, then why should we? Co-writers Nicolas Wright and James A. Woods also have roles in the movie, with Wright giving an embarrassing performance as the fumbling Rosenberg.Sadly, this marked one of the final film appearances for veteran actor Robert Loggia (VERY briefly reprising his original role, without dialogue); the movie is dedicated to him.Let's hope Emmerich and friends don't subject us to any more of these movies another 20 years from now.Five out of 10.",Independence Day - Resurgence

12,utgard14,Independence Day: Returdgence,1,29 November 2016,"Garbage sequel to Independence Day with some of the returning actors from the first movie (all the ones over the age of 60, basically) and a crop of younger actors suffering from severe charisma deficiency. It's a hollow, charmless effort with no memorable characters or scenes. There's nothing about this that will stay with you. Even the feelings of anger or sadness that fans of the original might feel will pass within a few days. There's a lot of special effects and a lot of stuff gets destroyed.

13,zardoz-13,"Surpasses the original ""Independence Day""",9,4 July 2016,"""Independence Day"" director Roland Emmerich's epic sequel ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" surpasses its feel-good, science fiction blockbuster about an alien invasion. The spectacular CGI depicting yet another Armageddon is incomparable, and this savvy sequel clocks in approximately 25 minutes shorter than the original without sacrificing narrative clarity. Mind you, Will Smith opted out because Twentieth Century Fox refused to pay him $50 million to reprise his role. Since the debacle of Smith's botched father & son sci-fi saga ""After Earth,"" the ""Fresh Prince"" star decided to steer clear and revive his box-office clout with the forthcoming DC Comics escapade ""Suicide Squad."" Officially, according to dialogue in ""Independence Day: Resurgence,"" Smith's heroic aviator Captain Steven Hiller died during a routine training accident flying an anti-gravity, hybrid space fighter. Mind you, Smith isn't the only original member gone missing. Margaret Colin, cast as President Whitmore's adviser Constance Spano as well as satellite engineer David Levinson's ex-wife in ""Independence Day,"" didn't comeback either. Vivica A. Fox, who played Hiller's stripper wife Jasmine, reprises her role momentarily as a courageous hospital nurse. The Hiller's family dog Boomer is AWOL, too. Surprisingly, ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" star Brent Spiner—who everybody figured had died in the original—emerges from a coma as the eccentric, long-haired, Area 51 scientist Dr. Brakish Okun. Spiner steals the show with his hippified performance. Jeff Goldblum as David, Judd Hirsh as David's father Julius, and Bill Pullman as former president Whitmore line-up for greater glory, along with the late Robert Loggia, Whitmore's adjutant General William Grey, who lived long enough to for a cameo before his death last year. Consequently, if you're counting on a complete ""ID4"" cast reunion, you're going to be frustrated. Presumably, accounting for the 20-year delay, Emmerich and his long-time writer & producer colleague Dean Devlin claimed that they balked at an earlier ""ID4"" sequel because the technology couldn't accommodate the staggering sequel that they had scripted many moons ago. Aside from its lavish CGI and fresh new faces, ""ID: R"" imitates the original in some respects, making it a first-rate follow-up, but Emmerich and Devlin have knocked the bottom out with a plot far more complex. ""ID4"" provided only glimpses of the anonymous aliens, while ""ID: R"" bristles with more aliens and shows us what an enormous Harvester Queen alien looks like gallivanting clumsily across the desert like Godzilla on the rampage. This spectacle is simultaneously as hilarious as it is awesome. Basically, ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" qualifies as the twenty-first century equivalent of Paramount Pictures' 1953 classic ""War of the Worlds."" Without a single speck of blood in sight, ""ID: R"" qualifies as an exciting, suspenseful, live-action sci-fi cartoon.Former U.S. President Whitmore (Bill Pullman of ""Sommersby"") has been experiencing traumatic episodes prompted by his psychic connection with the aliens in the past. Like Paul Revere, he struggles to warn his fellow Americans that the aliens are launching a retaliatory attack, and they mean to triumph this time. Furthermore, Whitmore has been obsessed with sketching pictures of a mysterious sphere. Meantime, General Adams (William Fichtner of ""Black Hawk Down"") is alarmed to learn that the alien warriors incarcerated after the war of '96' have emerged from their comatose, Rip Van Winkle state and are raving in their jail cells at Area 51. Adams wants an urgent parley with David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum of ""Death Wish""), but Levinson has gone off to Africa, in the depths of the Congo, where he is having a discussion with a double-machete toting warlord, Dikembe Umbutu (Deobia Oparei of ""Your Highness""), who is showing them one of the alien city destroyer spaceships. For no apparent reason, the lights on that alien spacecraft have been illuminated. The scientist who had been in charge of Area 51, Dr. Brakish Okun (Brent Spiner), awakens from a 20-year coma, and he knows something incredible is about to occur. Faraway, on the Moon, several tugs are maneuvering an alien space cannon onto a platform that mankind plans to use to protect the Earth from another alien invasion. During the operation, something unexpected that nobody can account for happens, and the gargantuan cannon topples disastrously toward the station. Tug pilot Jake Morrison (Liam Hemsworth of ""The Hunger Games"") refuses to obey orders to retreat from the falling cannon, and he manages to stop the falling cannon and re-install it. Naturally, his Chinese supervisor, Commander Jiang (Chin Ha of ""Contagion""), reprimands and grounds Jake. As the twentieth anniversary of the War of '96' approaches, U.S. President Lanford (Sela Ward of ""Gone Girl"") prepares to officiate the ceremonies from the White House. She greets Captain Hiller's step-son Dylan (Jessie T. Usher of ""When the Game Stands Tall"") who is flight commander of the Legacy Squadron that will fly the first human/alien fighters to the Moon. Dylan is friends with Lanford's speech writer, Patricia Whitmore (Maika Monroe of ""It Follows""), and Patricia's boyfriend is Jake. Jake and Dylan were once friends until Jake collided with Dylan's fighter during a flight, forcing Dylan to bail out. Now, Dylan and Jake are enemies. While all of these activities are unfolding, interference scrambles the transmissions between Earth and the Moon. Suddenly, before anybody realizes it, the aliens materialize in colossal ships and commence a second invasion. Simultaneously, a white sphere appears on Earth, and Lanford orders it destroyed, only to learn later it may not have posed a threat to mankind.""Independence Day: Resurgence"" reunites audiences with familiar characters and introduces new ones without wasting unnecessary time before the aliens start blasting everything in sight, including famous landmarks like they did in ""Independence Day."" If mankind imagined that they were unfairly matched the first time, things have grown far worse the second time. Not only have the aliens come back, but they are also intent on harvesting the Earth's Core unless our valiant heroes can thwart them. Predictable but suspenseful hokum from fade-in to fade-out, ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" amounts to the atypical sequel that overshadows its predecessor.",Independence Day - Resurgence

15,oscaralbert,Continually casting the American President . . .,8,5 July 2016,". . . as a potential Suicide Bomber makes a lot of sense for a Fox Megacorporation flick such as INDEPENDENCE DAY: RESURGENCE. After all, there is no way that President-Elect Trump could have even won the Rich People Party Nomination without Fox's around-the-clock free advertising on his behalf. Polls have consistently shown all year that the vast majority of U.S. Citizens, when asked, ""Which American would you like to see in the White House as President IF they had to blow themselves up with nuclear fusion bombs inside an alien spaceship 10 minutes after being sworn in?"" replied ""Donald Trump!"" (It's just a crying shame that Will Smith had to be killed off between INDEPENDENCE DAYS because Jada Pinkett insisted that Will get Trump's V.P. slot PLUS half his net worth to be in RESURGENCE, and the tightwad Fox Trumpenstein folks refused her modest demand!) Since every dog has its day, and because Reality is becoming foreordained by Movies with increasing frequency, we must all hope that a 100-foot-tall Harvester Queen shows up near Washington, DC, around noon next Jan. 20.

17,view_and_review,Oh The Horror,1,12 January 2017,"Ooh the critics were right. I'd heard the negative reviews of this movie while it was in its infancy in theaters and whereas I didn't totally ignore them I didn't totally believe them either. Now I have watched. I have looked into the bright sun though I was told not to and my sight has been snatched away from me. Now I seek independence from the mental torture that I was put through for the past two hours.As far as big budget movies go--this is the worst I've seen since... well since San Andreas, but San Andreas wasn't riding the coattails of a successful first installment. It was like they didn't even try on any level. Almost like, ""Hey, we killed it with Independence Day so all we have to do is roll out some drivel with the same title and we'll make tons of dough again.""This movie had it all: terrible acting, atrocious script, comical special effects (like it was still 1996), inane plot and did I mention the acting? Every actor was some generic automaton. And if they weren't some type of Stepford actor they were way over the top. This movie was quite literally the same one as in 1996 but bigger and more irritating. There were many of the same original characters in the same exact roles (besides Will Smith who wisely refrained from this farce) down to the similar ""inspirational"" speeches (at least they saved money on the script).ID:R was unoriginal, unimaginative, uncreative and largely unwatchable. I can't believe I found myself rooting for the aliens. At least if they wiped mankind out there would be no way to make another sequel (which they left the door open to). I can't criticize this movie enough and it deserves all the criticism it gets. If this review was a text message I'd add the poop emoji with flies buzzing around it. Agh! I'm so upset. And someone may ask, ""Why would you be upset at a movie?"" Two reasons: 1.) As has been stated by many before me: that's two hours of my life I can't get back and 2.) They just went and crapped on a very memorable movie. Why? Why resurrect something that needed no revival? One thing is for certain; whether it's next year or another 20 years from now, I will NOT be watching another Independence Day. Shoot, this movie dang near ruined the actual holiday itself.",Independence Day - Resurgence
18,neil-476,More fun with aliens in the desert,7,23 May 2018,"20 years after getting their collective alien asses handed to them, the Independence Day aliens are back, and boy are they annoyed!It's not entirely a surprise when the ID4 aliens come back. Despite the fact that Earth has used their alien technology from last time to create new weapons and fighting craft, the aliens have some new tricks up their sleeves (if they have sleeves) which enable them to generate vast quantities of destruction porn and start drilling for the Earth's core. Once more, Jeff Goldblum leads the fight against an enemy which outclasses the human race. Last time, Earth's resistance was led by Goldbum (brains), Will Smith (muscle), Brent Spiner (quirky scientist), Bill Pullman (President) and Randy Quaid (nutjob thanks to alien rectal probes,). This time the same people are around except for Quaid (who made the ultimate sacrifice last time) and Smith (whose character died in the interim and is here replaced by a charisma-free son).I'm pleased to report that this film is missing a number of the elements which so annoyed me about the original, such as the only bloke who knows what's happening being the estranged husband of the President's personal assistant rather than a checkout girl from Tesco - the stupidity factor is noticeably lower, as is the glutinous gung-ho US flag-waving, which our American friends so loved. Which is not to say that there isn't some nonsense here: a busload of schoolkids, for instance, whose sole purpose appears to be to shoehorn in Judd Hirsch as Goldblum's Dad again, and provide some jeopardy for a giant alien rampage. But the thing looks great. The destruction is wonderfully presented - director Roland Emmerich's greatest strength - and, for the most part, the aliens and the combat are well done. There are some places where it's a bit difficult to keep track of who is doing what to whom and where they are doing it, but I was happy to overlook that.Don't expect your brain to be stretched very much but, if you enjoyed the first one, you'll probably enjoy this one too.Oh, and it didn't escape my notice that I watched this Independence Day movie on the day the UK voted to leave the EU: I suspect that this is no more than coincidence!",Independence Day - Resurgence

They inspired us to rise from the ashes as one people of one world.,3,31 August 2018,"Independence Day: Resurgence is a poor sequel, with weak characters and a poor script.Making a sequel without Will Smith seems pointless, Jeff Goldblum's character's the only quality character and that's mostly due to what we know about him from the previous film. The rest of them were bloody terrible, besides maybe the President and his daughter and David's old man. I remember someone saying in a comment section, that in this one instead of uploading a virus they give the aliens Windows 10 auto update. That's hilarious, it's a shame they didn't employ this person, because there weren't many laughs to be had. Positively, I thought the queen alien was good and swung the direction of the film around somewhat, but you still have the annoying characters present to diminish its quality.

20,FlashCallahan,Independence Day: Regurgitated....,6,28 June 2016,"I must admit, even though I wasn't a fan of the first movie, I haven't yearned for Will Smith to be on a cinema ever before in his cinematic career, because Jessie Usher is trying really hard to emulate his screen father, but every time he utters a one liner, you just want the earth to end.And this is the big problem with the film. Hemsworth and Usher ruin the film with their delivery, and spoil the other younger members of their super duper space pilot programme, which equals in a lack of urgency for the films plot.Using recovered alien technology, the nations of Earth have collaborated on an immense defence program to protect the planet. But nothing can prepare them for the aliens' advanced and unprecedented force. Only the ingenuity of a few brave men and women can bring our world back from the brink of extinction.Independence Day, when first released, was ground breaking for one reason......it's special effects. We had seen nothing on such a grand scale before, and lest we forget, it was the biggest release of that year. A year when other big summer releases were Twister, Eraser, The Rock, and John Travolta's Phenomenon.These days, a film like ID:R gets released every other week, so the first films selling point has gone before the film has even started, the selling point of spectacle.You see one landmark get destroyed, you've seen them all get destroyed, and it's pretty ho-hum nowadays.But it kept me entertained,my hanks to the elements of the first film, namely Goldblum, Hirsch, and Pullman. Their characters keep the film chugging along at a steady pace, but as soon as we are taken back to the space boy band part of the film, it loses its grip and just focuses on petty arguments, rather than the drama and humour that the two seasoned actors have to offer.So it's no surprise that it's not doing as well as Fox would have liked it to do, we've seen it so many times in the last twenty tears, it's badly edited, their is a pointless sub-plot involving Hirsch and The Little Rascals, and the last ten minutes resembles Emmerich's biggest mistake: Godzilla.But, and it's a big but, it wasn't the disaster that I was expecting.Just the lack of urgency, Space Boy Bands, Spiner over mugging like he hadn't before, and a Maguffin that reminded me of Marvin The Paranoid Androids head, spoiled the genuinely interesting parts.Namely scenes with Goldblum and Pullman.They bought a little humanity to the whole thing.",Independence Day - Resurgence

But even then this flick becomes a big joke. The jokes used are childish. The story itself is rather weak and some characters are really lame. The effects used are okay but it's the story combined with the effects that breaks it down. Just watch the tsunami that destroys the US coast. It's really well done but then a small boat comes in and makes it stupid as hell.For me the best part was the end scene when the queen alien attacks the school bus.

You would think that in 20 years they had time enough to write a good story with a lot of new techniques and so but nothing is less true. I did like the first movie though, it was an okay movie to watch. At least for a blockbuster. But Independence Day Resurgence doesn't come way near to the same level as the first one. It's all déjà-vu, and we saw way better then that. For a big budget you would think you get something interesting to watch. The annoying soundtrack doesn't help either to the movie. And what to say about the casual joke every now and then when they are being attacked by thousands of high tech aliens, while the world is almost ending. I don't think anyone of us would think it was time for a bit of banter. Anyways, this one is a disappointment, considering the cast and the money they had to make it.",Independence Day - Resurgence

The truth is that the veteran actors, especially Brent Spinner, were decent and thus elevated the film up to an almost average status. The rest of the movie is a recipe driven, nostalgia eating, completely uninspiring mess.But before I start badmouthing this too much, a lot of the ugliness in the film might be coming from really bad editing. I mean, it was horrible enough to see when they made the cut and the pieces didn't fit. Perhaps waiting for an extended edition might bring a little bit more satisfaction.That being said, this is not Batman vs Superman. No editing miracle will make this a good movie. The script is puerile, the old characters just carry the glory they had in the original film while the new characters are completely forgettable and undeveloped. The physics don't pan out, the aliens are pathetic, special effects scenes are being obviously reused and the Chinese actors that they introduced for the Asian market have characters clearly out of place. Even the speeches were boring.Bottom line: feels like someone was asleep when they wrote the script. Everything is a cliché, from the alien pull-and-drop attack to the cardboard characters, from the bland sacrifices to the uninspiring speeches, from the recipe scenes that should have been emotional and were ridiculous to the evil and stupid villain.Such a disappointment.",Independence Day - Resurgence

Sure it's a campy and simple movie, but it still was a really good popcorn flick. And was very entertaining to watch, especially when it first came out. I recently watched a film called ""Now You See Me 2"" which is a disappointing sequel. However this sequel is even worse and is even cheesier than the previous one. It's like they compacted a lot of aerial battle sequences and just didn't care much about the story and what made the previous one good. It lacked the uplifting spirit, the feeling of motivation that the audiences felt which lead me personally to cheer near the end. It didn't have the charisma and engaging character dynamics the previous one has. The humor is campy in the first one, but this time it just came off cringe worthy and just plain boring to sit through. There just wasn't any heart in this one, the humanities will power to keep fighting. It's just a boring and soulless movie. After the first hour it seems to get a bit interesting then it takes another nose dive. Near the end they tried to make this a giant monster movie but it just wasn't engaging or thrilling. The thing that makes giant monster movies work is the mystery, build up and tension or thrills. Which this movie faltered in every level. Despite the very high budget it felt like a B movie that should have went straight to DVD. Not saying all B movies are bad or anything like that but you get the point. ""Battle Los Angeles"" is another disappointing movie that deals with an alien invasion. But even that is better than this. Overall this is another disappointing sequel that got the hype for nothing.

Almost 20 years ago. That in and of itself says something about ""Independence Day: Resurgence."" I remember watching the original, but aside from the basic plot line of an alien invasion I can't remember anything about it except that Will Smith was the star. Clearly it didn't make too much of an impact on me. So why bother - 20 years later, when many of those who saw the original will have moved on from the experience - making a sequel? And if the original viewers have moved on why stack the movie with a bunch of veteran actors (Jeff Goldblum, Judd Hirsch, Bill Pullman, Brent Spiner - but no Will Smith, because he must have known better and had better options) who aren't really going to inspire younger viewers to flock to this? Some movies demand sequels. ""Rocky"" demanded ""Rocky II""; ""The Wrath Of Khan"" demanded ""The Search For Spock."" ""Independence Day"" did not demand ""Independence Day: Resurgence."" ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" was a mistake. A big one.It's just a bad movie. The cast isn't especially appealing, the performances aren't especially good, the characters are bland, the dialogue is juvenile, the attempts at humour are forced and not very funny. And, not surprisingly after all that, the story - the aliens apparently want to mine the earth's molten core - is bad. I fought to pay attention to this. I really did. But it was hard. It wasn't a complete disaster. Some of the special effects were pretty good. I appreciated the poke that was given to conspiracy theorists - they're ""putzes"" in the words of Julian Levinson (Judd Hirsch). (For the most part I agree.) But a couple of good things can't save a movie that's bad at its core.Some movies demand a sequel, but for the most part sequels are extremely hit and miss things - and ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" is a definite miss. Even more frighteningly - a sequel that should never have been made has apparently spawned a sequel of its own, because it seems that ""Independence Day 3"" is already planned, and it was clearly set up by the last scene of this one.

27,Hellmant,"Almost as good as the original, except no Will Smith!",7,27 June 2016,"'INDEPENDENCE DAY: RESURGENCE': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The sequel to the 1996 blockbuster sci-fi epic, about a massive alien invasion on Earth. This sequel takes place 20-years after the events of the first movie, when the alien invaders return with reinforcements. Many of the lead actors, from the original film, reprise their roles in this installment; including Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman, Judd Hirsch, Vivica A. Fox, Brent Spiner and William Fichtner. Will Smith did not return, due to budget restraints (and Smith's self absorbed ego), but Liam Hemsworth, Maika Monroe, Jessie T. Usher, Travis Tope, Charlotte Gainsbourg and Sela Ward joined the cast. Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin returned as co-writers and co-producers of the flick, and Emmerich also (once again) directed this sequel. The film feels very similar to the original hit, but not quite as good.The story picks up 20-years after the events of the first movie, when the United Nations has created a global defense system, called Earth Space Defense; which uses technology left behind by the defeated aliens. The aliens, of course, return to Earth, with an even bigger army of reinforcements; and an obsessive intent to take over the planet, and harvest it for their own. The central characters include David Levinson (Goldblum) and former U.S. president Thomas Whitmore (Pullman), once again, as well as Whitmore's daughter Patricia (Monroe), her boyfriend, ESD pilot Jake Morrison (Hemsworth), and Dylan Dubrow-Hiller (Usher); the son of Steven Hiller (Will Smith), who's now deceased. The movie almost feels like a remake, rather than a sequel, but it is (somewhat) nostalgic seeing all of the characters again. The visuals are breathtaking, and the alien battles are cool. The film is almost as good as the original, except no Will Smith; Hemsworth definitely doesn't cut it (as a substitute). I remember when I saw the first movie, for the first time, and Will Smith was awesome in it; he was this really charismatic blockbuster star, just starting out. That's what this sequel is truly lacking.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/- KJTB5KGois",Independence Day - Resurgence

29,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Fails to evoke any of the big impact the original may have had,4,13 July 2016,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Twenty years after Earth's momentous victory against the alien invasion, President Whitmore (Bill Pullman), the human symbol of hope against the martians, is having recurring nightmares about their return that have left him bed bound. However, in the wake of the victory, a peaceful alliance has been formed between the various nations of the world, who have learned to live in peace after coming together to fight off a much bigger force. In memory of his heroic father, Dylan Hiller (Jessie T. Usher) is continuing his legacy, and fighting in the Air Force, where he's at odds with co pilot Jake Morrison (Liam Hemsworth.) However, they'll have to put their differences aside when the shape of a new threat emerges.This constant barrage of resurrecting old franchises, or 're-booting', is sure to evoke some strong feelings of nostalgia in many of the 30+ or so current cinema-going population. Watching this belated sequel to Independence Day caused me to cast my mind back to when I was twelve years old, and watching the original at a now closed cinema, as a family unit with my mom, dad and sister. If the film succeeds with nothing else, it's resurrecting memories of an older, more innocent time that you can't help but look back and cherish (as well as leave you to commiserate how much time has moved on and how much older you are.) As for this modern day update, it doesn't seem to be trying to serve any other purpose than to be bigger, badder and more spectacular than the original, whilst retaining its jingoistic 'America saves the world' tone, a tough task when the original spectacle and wonderment has been and gone. Original director Roland Emmerich is back and the helm, and seems in no doubts about this, serving up a threadbare plot, with the most minimal sense of character development, that seems to have borrowed more than a little creative licence from a similar, far superior Alien themed film from 1986, with its tale of a mother alien and her spawn. The special effects, including an update of the original 'mother spaceship' hovering over the sky, are impressive, but in a more aesthetic, less awesome way than in '96.The promotion has cynically tried to make the twenty year time span something to tie in with the relevance of the film, when in fact it seems more to do with desperation, yet another insincere return of something dreamt up by lazy Hollywood executives for cheap cash. Independence Day: Regurgence would have been a more apt title. **",Independence Day - Resurgence
30,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"It's simply alright: enjoyable enough to watch, but never anything more; it isn't memorable and isn't new, but it is fairly fun and I wasn't begging for it to be over.",4,25 June 2016,"'Independence Day: Resurgence (2016)' is the latest film in the recent spate of 'revival' sequels, being released 20 years after the original. The first thing that comes to my mind is: Why? Indeed, most of these types of film are unnecessary and ultimately disappointing; they are certainly not as good as the originals, even if they are pretty good on their own right. This film is no different. I never really loved the first 'Independence Day', finding it very cheesy and generally messy, so this film didn't 'disappoint' me as such. It's basically more of the same, despite having a slightly different plot and a few new characters. It isn't bad, but is certainly not great. It's enjoyable enough to watch, but never anything more; it isn't memorable and isn't new, but it's sometimes fairly fun and I wasn't begging for it to be over.The film has it's fair share of issues, many of which also plagued the original. The first problem is the over-abundance of characters. There are both returning cast members (most notably Jeff Goldblum and Bill Pullman) and some new additions such as Liam Hemsworth, Jessie T. Usher and Maika Monroe. The returning members are pretty good, and capture the spirit of their characters accurately, but the new additions are honestly a little boring. Their performances aren't bad, but they aren't doing anything new or interesting - all three of the new leads just feel as though they are playing themselves. Something that bugged me was that they killed off Will Smith's character prior to the start of this film, as he didn't want to - or just couldn't - reprise his role, but kept Judd Hirsch's character alive; he was the one returning character that could have been left out, perhaps not even mentioned, without anyone blinking an eye. On top of this, the death written for Smith's character was very anti-climactic and it didn't have an impact on the film at all: they could have developed Jessie T. Usher's character a lot more by using this event, which would have made him more rounded and relatable, but they just didn't. There's also too many side-characters. Most of these people add nothing to the plot, and just serve to extend the length of the film. A couple of them are given way too much screen-time, as the filmmakers clearly think that they are funnier than they actually are; they started to annoy me after a while. The film just keeps cutting back to them and I didn't care about them at all. As such, the movie feels very unstructured and overly chaotic.This extends to the action, too. The CGI isn't bad, in fact it is pretty convincing at times, but it is relied upon too heavily. I only spotted one brief practical effect (there may have been more I didn't notice.) It ends up feeling like a mess, with so many CG elements on screen at once that it is hard to follow the action. It doesn't feel completely intangible and is generally fun, but it does look kind of implausible or unrealistic; there's just something a little off about it. The script is not great either, with a lot of on-the-nose and corny dialogue, and it insists upon telling you everything - even when it is being, or has just been, shown on screen. This is most prevalent in a very expositional speech towards the beginning that basically serves to fill you in on what's happened since the first film, which feels very clunky and unneeded (as the things described are being shown on-screen, in many cases.) The movie also relies heavily on coincidences, making a lot of what happens feel all the more unlikely and unconnected. The final issue I have is the fact that a lot of things don't make sense. Most of these are very little and generally inconsequential, but there are a couple of bigger plot holes.There are some good things here, though. The best part of the entire film is Jeff Goldblum. He gives the best performance, looks as though he is really having fun and is also the most interesting character. I wish that the film focused more on him, as his humour and mannerisms are very entertaining: everyone loves a bit of Goldblum, don't they? Without him, the film would have had to rely on the new cast of characters and would have suffered greatly as a result. Another good thing about it is that it's pretty fun, in a 'don't think about it' kind of way. It starts to get better leading up to and during the final act. Here, you start to accept it's absurd nature and the film focuses upon actually battling with the aliens. During this time, the side-characters are mostly side-lined making for a more streamlined segment. It also raises the stakes somewhat with a more unique plot device, and features an enjoyable climactic dog-fight. The final act is only soured by the ending, which is a very on-the-nose attempt to set up a sequel film - one that sounds even more preposterous than this one.Overall, 'Independence Day: Resurgence (2016)' isn't a particularly good or bad film. I was reasonably entertained during most of the picture, though it fluctuates from being poor to amusing all too often. Some of the characters are annoying, the CGI is a little messy and the whole film feels rather unnecessary - not to mention very similar to the first film. I liked some of it and never exactly wished it would be over, but ultimately it's both unmemorable and mostly disposable. 4/10.",Independence Day - Resurgence
31,bowmanblue,Suspend disbelief... and enjoy (most of it),7,27 April 2017,"I remember watching the original 'Independence Day' back in 1996. I had never looked forward to a film so much since 'Return of the Jedi.' It was the mid-nineties, 'The X-Files' was at its peak and everyone was asking the question: What if aliens really DID exist? The trailers looked so cool – no one had ever seen such amazing special effects and the clips of fighter jets involved in dogfights against UFOs ignited the fanboy in all of us. I left the cinema VERY let-down.The dogfights were minimal, the story was overly-cheesy, there were major/ridiculous plot holes (remember the Apple computer taking down an alien ship?) and the whole thing just seemed like one big disappointment. And yet it was one of the most successful movies ever made (Box Office figures, anyway), yet no sequel ever came. Now, twenty years later, we have another story in the franchise. And, if you've been keeping your eye on sequels which come a long time after the original, you'll know how they normally turn out.I'd read a lot of reviews before I saw the film and expected the worst. However, about an hour in and I was wondering where all the hatred came from. Don't get me wrong, ID4 (2) is no classic, but it never seemed quite as bad as some people made out. I'd go as far as to say that the first half of the film is actually pretty tense as the build up to the new alien attack cranks up the tension. It did descend a little once they arrived and the lasers started firing as you kind of know who's never going to get killed and who's just there to be offed at the earliest opportunity.Although, what I found its biggest let-down to be is its humour. Things roll along quite nicely until something that's supposed to be funny crops up and just brings the serious tone down. Okay, some humour in a serious film is nice if done well, but it felt like every action scene had to have a 'one-liner' tacked on to the end. Plus some sub plots concerning secondary characters could probably be removed completely to make the film a little shorter (Jeff Goldblum's dad for a start – quite unnecessary).The set pieces are pretty good with plenty of new destruction and we do get to see jets using alien technology fight the alien aggressors. Naturally, our plucky survivors need to come up with something a little better than just repeatedly shooting the new spaceships and – this time – it doesn't involve Apple (thank goodness!). However, if the aliens really wanted to take over the Earth then they don't need to repeatedly destroy our major cities killing most of our population. They only really need to kill about seven pertinent humans who all just so happen to be in the right place at the right time with the right skill-sets to just so happen to foil these intergalactic nasties' plans. In other words – coincidence seems to play a big part in the humans' plans.You probably already know by now that Will Smith chose not to return. Whether you feel that him choosing 'Suicide Squad' over this was a better choice is up to you. Personally, I thought the film would have benefited from his inclusion over some of the lesser characters we ended up with.So, overall, I enjoyed a lot of what was on offer here. It's big dumb fun and there is enjoyment here if you're willing to suspend your disbelief long enough. It's a pity that the humour and annoyingly included secondary characters kept spoiling the mood. Plus do the special effects look so bad during the last five minutes during the scenes in the desert – seriously, it's obvious the actors are just up against a blue screen. The rest of the film was all right (FX-wise)!",Independence Day - Resurgence

By bringing back every actor except him. None of these guys have the charisma he did. Jeff Goldblum is not entertaining enough on his own. Of all the movies from 2016 that I saw, this has the lowest score on the IMDb and I can understand why. The worst part about this film is probably the pacing. I mean, even for a two hour movie, it seemed too short! I think the entire span of this film takes place in only a day or two. That's not enough time to set up an alien invasion. Everything is so clichéd. I knew that one guy would say he hadn't crashed anything in days. One of the character's father was killed by an alien and there are speeches about how we have to work together to beat them. The characters are mostly annoying particularly with how they just hit on women and start fights with everybody. There's just no one likable here.

35,lesleyharris30,"A Formulaic, Tiresome Disaster Movie,",3,1 July 2016,"Independence Day: Resurgence is a brutal movie with a poorly developed plot and a few talented actors that are wasted by lackluster storytelling. The only shed of light in this whole movie for me was Jeff Goldblum, Liam Hemsworth and Bill Pullman, who are all charismatic on screen, making us feel at ease when they turn up. However, they can not save the rest of the cast, who are given terrible dialogue that they simply can not deliver as well as the other three, with actors who I usually enjoy, such as Brent Spiner and William Fichtner, embarrassing themselves on screen. The movie keeps referring to itself as being ""bigger"" than the first Independence Day, however, it does little to prove that, just because the effects and the aliens are larger does not make the movie bigger, lacking the heart, humour and energy that made the original enjoyable in the first place. You can tell that the writers, producers, directors did not care about this movie being any good, and that is what bothered me the most, it is blatantly obvious that it was made for the sake of money and they did not care one bit about disappointing fans of the original, shame on them. Boring, cliché and predictable, Will Smith avoided this sequel, and you should too. The Earth is faced with a new threat from an alien race twenty years after the first invasion.

*Jeff Goldblum
*CGI was absolutely fantastic
*Some characters were likeable (like Judd Hirsch playing Goldblums dad)Cons:
*No Will Smith
*Storyline was too mediocre like it felt too much of Star Wars than Independence Day
* 20 years too late for Hollywood to be butchering a well received classic. They don't know when to leave originals alone like f them totally if they are going make a mockery of forgetting about a original years later....",Independence Day - Resurgence
38,CuriosityKilledShawn,"Too little, too late.",6,11 July 2019,"Despite the many complaints I will get to with Independence Day: Resurgence it will always stick in my mind as the first premiere I attended at the Chinese Theater in Hollywood. The Brexit vote was counted during the screening and when everyone exited the movie the press were sticking mics in the faces of celebs asking them for their opinion on Britain leaving the EU - a fitting occurrence considering the title of the movie.Sadly, the film bombed, raking in just $100,000,000 during it's run, a fraction of the original's box office takings. It was too little too late. A 20-year gap between movies was just too long and the politics and culture of the US is now drastically different. Independence Day came out in a time when spirits were high, the '96 Olympics had everyone pumped up, the summer season was full of exciting blockbusters, and painful, boring superhero movies were virtually non-existent. Fever Pitch was the feeling all summer long and a jingoistic, heroic movie was exactly what audience wanted at the time. ID:4 delivered all that and more. In 2016 the culture war had already started and self-hatred in America was beginning to rip the country apart. Independence Day 2 really should have come out in 2000, when there was still optimism, but Roland Emmerich was too busy making The Patriot during that time, plus he and Dean Devlin had no idea how to tackle the gargantuan scope a sequel would inevitably have.It's a shame, because this is actually much more thoughtful film than the first and I really dug the psychic storyline. But everything else in the film is pedestrian and lazy, even for Emmerich these cliches and tropes are tired and dull. Remember David Arnold's rousing, exciting score from the first movie? Of course you do! It's not here. Instead, excruciatingly untalented ""composer"" Harald Kloser (also serving as producer) cranks out worthless noise that a high-schooler could beat. There are musicians with real talent out there, chomping at the bit to get a start in movies and yet this man constantly gets work (only with Emmerich). It boggles my mind.With Will Smith asking for a stupendously arrogant $50,000,000 paycheck they wisely wrote his character out. How dare this man ask for that money! His star power has been on the decline for years now (thanks largely to fast-tracking his untalented children into movie stardom) and he should have embraced this movie as a comeback. Margaret Colin is also written-out with no explanation within the movie (in the prequel novel she died in a car wreck). Mae Whitman has been replaced with Maika Monroe because she didn't grow up to be pretty enough, apparently. At least Brent Spiner came back (his character's fate was left unexplained in the first one, be he was never written to die, it just seemed that way) and Jeff Goldblum is front and centre, whether he likes it or not, but he's got the charisma to carry it. He's certainly far, far more appealing than the lesser Hemsworth and Jessie Usher, who are given virtually nothing to do and really shouldn't have been in the movie when their screen time could have been used for building suspense instead.The scenes of destruction in the first movie were breathtaking at the time, and still have impressive effect all this time later thanks mainly to the extensive model work used (ID:4 holds the record for the most model work ever used in a movie, which will likely never be broken thanks to the advent of excessive CGI) but we're so used to scenes of cities being destroyed at this point that none of the effects, no matter how elaborate, really fill us with awe.The model work and real locations in the first movie gave it a tangible realness and placed it in a world you could identify. Here literally EV-ER-Y-THING is done against a green screen, giving far too many shots a flat, static look where the lighting on the actors doesn't match the light on the CGI background. It's horrible, and gives the film the look and feel of a cheap TV movie. This is Emmerich at his laziest. There's no passion behind this.First time around we had a double climax and two reasons to cheer (and, believe me, audiences did). No such luck with the sequel. The ending is completely disappointing and any excitement you might feel will completely fizzle out before the credits roll. They strongly hint at a third movie, but there's no way that will ever happen now. The energy in this franchise drained out a long time ago and the culture in the US is too self-hating to embrace it.I really wanted to like this movie, and it has some really good ideas, but it squanders all of its potential and sleepwalks through poorly-directed familiar territory. Such a huge shame.",Independence Day - Resurgence

In the twenty years since the first attack mankind has advanced in many ways through the use of alien technology and things are going fine, until a strange ship is seen, and out of fear attacked. Once the ship goes down the aliens begin their new assault on the planet. Once again David Levinson (Goldblum) is called in to help. With the help of Jake Morrison (Hemsworth) and a few old friends the planet must once again find a way to fight back. To be honest, I was a little worried about this movie. I really liked the first one, but in recent years bringing back an old series hasn't worked out that well. This is an exception. That said, this is not as good as the original and is essentially the same movie, but I liked the original so that didn't bother me that much. This is a movie where you pretty much get what you expect. Aliens attack, Earth fights back, and we (the viewer) get to once again enjoy the ride. Will Smith is missing, cast wise, but isn't really felt in the movie at all. Pullman is still as good as ever and the new additions really add to the enjoyment. This is not a movie that will become a classic or win awards, but it is super entertaining and that is what some movies are made for.

41,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,4,12 October 2016,"Independence Day: ResurgenceThe funny thing about 20-year reunions with aliens that tried to invade Earth is that they're all fat and bald now.Unfortunately, the ones arriving in this sci-fi adventure are a new species entirely.On the twenty-year anniversary of Earth's eradication of occupying ETs, the planet's visited by an altruistic race that wants to evacuate the globe before its enemies return to extract the planet's molten core. Now, it's up to veterans (Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman, Judd Hirsch) and neophytes (Liam Hemsworth, Jessie Usher Maika Monroe) alike to work with the agreeable extraterrestrials to defeat this threat.Eighteen years too late, this highly uncalled for continuation of the bygone blockbuster is a sad effort to cash-in on nostalgic audiences. Regrettably, it does so with a convoluted and incomplete script that diminishes the first, and embarrasses its self.Incidentally, it's inconsiderate of other life forms to invade on our long weekends.

42,851222,"Please, Bring Me Back To The 1996",6,4 July 2016,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Independence Day: Resurgence"" (2016) was kinda disappointing experience to me. I love the first movie, i even thing the first ""Independence Day"" is a mainstream movie classic. ""Resurgence"", unfortunately, won't become a classic. It doesn't have that WOW factor in terms of special effects - although there are many of them in here and they are pretty good, it just won't have the same lasting impression - they are quickly forgettable, well, except maybe for the queen at the end - the biggest ""Aliens"" queen rip-off i have ever seen. It also doesn't have Will Smith - he kinda glued many thinks back in 1996 with his charisma, actors of this movie (except for Jeff Goldblum off course) lacks any of it. But the biggest let down in this movie was screenplay. It is written for like 10-14 years old audience members - seriously. It lacks any lines that would generate that ""Yeeee!"" factor, anything that would make us care for the characters of rote for them. The only more or less interesting aspect was the gay couple, although even that was done kinda lame.Overall, ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" is best witnessed when there is some alcohol involved. Otherwise, as a fan of the first movie, i can't even recommend this movie because of a very, very poor script which kinda ruined this movie for me and made me roll my eyes like every 5-10 min. - and that is a very, very bad sign. Everything else would have been OK here, if not for that very poor script. You can safely see this flick on a home media, with some friends on some Friday evening when there is popcorn and light alcohol involved.",Independence Day - Resurgence
43,ironhorse_iv,"Yes, Independence Day: Regurgitation was a bad movie, but it's also mindless entertaining. It's near the Fourth of July, let's show them some fireworks!",6,1 July 2016,"The sequel to 1996's blockbuster alien-invasion thriller, 'Independence Day' indeed went through, a lot of development hell. It wasn't until, 20th Century Fox lost the Star Wars franchise to Disney in 2012; that it really made steps to make the sequels of 'Independence Day' into their new Sci-Fi franchise. Directed by Roland Emmerich, once again, the movie takes place 20 years after the original alien invasion. The world now has a unified international planetary space fleet to protect Earth from possible alien threats, they had rebuild some of their cities, and the United States has imprisoned some of the original captured aliens at Area 51. But just as the planet is ready to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the defeat of the alien forces, Dr. David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) discovers that an even larger ""queen"" alien and her hive of forces is ready to attack, this time, going after Earth's inner core. Without spoiling the movie, too much, while this alien invasion movie was nowhere as good as the original summer popcorn flick was in 1996. It was still somewhat fun to watch. However, I am assuming that perhaps you are in wondering why in the living hell, did I enjoy this cheesy campy movie. Either that, or you're wondering where can, you get what I'd been smoking. I tell you, why. While, the story was pure sh*t, at less, the visuals weren't that bad, even if the CGI looks a bit fake-looking. That's not a bad thing. Stupid B-movies like these, can be, easily enjoyed, if you're willing to turn off your brain for a bit, and just take it as it is; a visual cluster-f*ck. There are times when I am in the mood for more sophistical serious films and others when I just want to watch things get blown up! In many ways, this sequel spoke to my inner ten year old. However, I do have to take off my rose colored nostalgia glasses, off for a second, and face facts, here. The directing, set design, composition, and even writing was nowhere near the level of the first one. It had really bad pacing. It felt like there was a heroic sacrifice, despairing moment, death scene, and comedy bit all within 5 minutes. It wasn't very compelling. It really had, little emotional depth. Another thing, although a few of the original actors reprise their roles, some were somewhat wasted like Vivica A. Fox's character, Jasmine Hiller. Others characters like Dr. Brackish Okun (Brent Spiner) & Julius Levinson (Judd Hirsch) weren't really needed, as their scenes, felt like time-wasters screen muggers. Then, there is the awkward use of the original three main characters. First off, it's very jarring, not to see Will Smith return as Capt. Steven Hiller. His character lack of screen presence was indeed felt as Smith was too expensive to hired for this role. Also, the younger brash replacements character like Lt. Jake Morrison (Liam Hemsworth) & his son, Capt. Dylan Hiller (Jessie T. Usher) were indeed, no match to his charm. Nevertheless, this has to be Liam Hemsworth's most charisma role, yet. His presence is fine, and dandy, but the movie doesn't give him or Jessie T. Usher, enough time for some character development. In the end, they turn out, very average. Another character, returning from the original movie is President Thomas J. Whitmore (Bill Pullman), whom come across, as unintentional hilarious with his crazy man shtick. It's funny, how well, he walks without his walking cane at times. Wow, they really ruined his character. However, the actress that plays his daughter, Patricia Whitmore, Maika Monroe was not that bad. Still, I would had love to see actress, Mae Whitman return. In my opinion, the only original character that came out somewhat looking good, was Jeff Goldblum's David Levinson, whom once again, figure out, a way to save the world, even if whole kill the leader plot, which supposedly incapacitates all the aliens, doesn't make a lick of sense. Wouldn't the aliens still need the fuel to get home? It's pretty bad. It's seem to taken, straight out of films like 1977's 'Star Wars' & 1986's 'Aliens'. Honestly, am I, the only one, who saw some plot similarities with this film, with that of 2007's 'Cloverfield' & 2005's 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy', here!? Anyways, the new characters in this film, were mostly a miss than a hit for me. I really couldn't stand for the annoying sidekicks, Floyd Rosenberg (Nicolas Wright) & Charlies Miller (Travis Tope) at all. Then, there is the awkward shoehorning of the Chinese market, with Asian characters like Rain Lao (Angela Wing) & Commander Jiang (Chin Han) who were alright, but not well characterized. In my opinion, the only new characters, I kinda like, were General Adams (William Fichtner) and the crazy warlord, Dikembe Umbutu (Deobia Oparei), even if their backstory is a bit puzzling, much like the physics and science in this film, which pretty much, is thrown out for science fantasy, over science fiction. Overall: It's not a good movie. It's not that the first Independence Day is a masterpiece by any stretch, but it's fun and loud and audiences felt invested in the various characters and story lines. This sequel feels very adequate. Still, I can't really say I hate this sequel. I just wish, it was better.",Independence Day - Resurgence
44,The-Sarkologist,They're Back,6,25 June 2016,"Actually, I ended up enjoying this more than I did the original movie, probably because the main reason I saw the original was to see the aliens blew up New York and Los Angeles. However what I didn't like about the original film was that it seemed, at least at the end, to be little more than a copy of Star Wars. However, this is not a review of the original but rather a review of the sequel. Mind you, I was a little apprehensive, first of all because I didn't think much of the original, and secondly I remember that the lines to the first movie were huge. Well, it turn out not the be the case in both regards.The film is set twenty years after the invasion, the world is at peace (well, sort of, since there are still pockets where the inhabitants are ferociously independent), and the technology has advanced significantly thanks to all of the space ships that had crashed on the Earth. However, when the mothership was destroyed a signal was sent out into space to alert the queen of a clear and present danger – Earth. If they had managed to defeat the initial wave then no doubt they were going to be a threat. However Earth knew that such a threat was there so they went about building a defence system to could effectively deal with the alien's return. The catch is that it things never happen the same the second time around.Like the original film, this film focus around a couple of groups, including some characters that have returned from the original film (with the exception of Will Smith). Obviously they are all twenty years older, and some of them are starting to have dreams of this alien ship. When it arrives the general consensus is that it is hostile, so they shoot it down. However, then the actual hostile ship arrives, and it is so big that it literally covers the top half of the Northern Hemisphere. Also, they seem to have learnt from their previous mistakes in that they simply don't appear with all guns blazing but use a lot more strategy.What I thought was cool was how more of the aliens appeared, especially the Queen (though the aliens still look as if they had been borrowed from the Alien franchise). In fact the grand finale is basically one huge battle with the queen. Mind you, the film did take a bit to pick up, and it seemed to drag a bit at the beginning. Also the main characters (and there were a number of them) did seem to be a bit stereotypical, such as the fly-boy who was sent to the moon because he was a little too reckless, the kid that passed the academy with top marks, and of course the son of the hero from the first movie, who happens to have inherited his fame from his father.So, while the film did take a bit to start up, by the end it had really picked up the pace. I wouldn't call it an edge of your seat thriller – it's a sci-fi movie – but it is quite enjoyable, especially if you are looking for a dose of science-fiction to tie over your day.",Independence Day - Resurgence

46,Reno-Rangan,The earthlings are united to defend the home from another alien attack.,6,24 October 2016,"I have said it many times that when I love a film, I always pray for a sequel to come. But I won't do that for all the films like perhaps 'Taken' and this one. These are not designed for that kind of a stretch or to own a franchise. So anyway they have made it and I'd watched. Since I was not expecting it, I did not care about the how it ends. I mean critically failed and the box office was okay, but did not meet the expectations. I mean not found anywhere near to the original film's collection.For me, minus half point for the Chinese flavour. I think the Hollywood must stop leaning towards Chinese contents. It is like they are ignoring the rest of the world. I want the old days American films, not this yuan targeted films. Sorry, that is one of the reasons why I disliked films like this, 'Now You See Me 2' and many other recent sino-Hollywood films.This story takes place 20 years later to the original film. Only a handful of characters returned and many of them were new. So now the humans leaped forward after adapting the alien technology. But when they learn the distress call was sent to the base of the enemy from the 20 years ago event, they are underprepared for another alien attack that follows very soon. Without any option they push their full force to defend the earth and it would they succeed or not is what the remaining film to reveal.Nowadays the graphics are not an issue. The filmmaking had touched down for a standard in the visual quality, especially a big production like this. So those parts even overplay the performances of the real actors. We have seen that from Gollum, King Kong and many other monster films. So if you are watching a today's high end film means, it is a pleasure from the blow ups we expect the most. Similar to killings from the horror thrillers. This film does that so well, that mean it is entertaining, but not the overall film very praisable.This story can be easily connected to many classics such as 'Star Wars' and 'Avatar'. Because how it ends seems like a story about the origins of those films. So the third film is like definitely takes us deep into the space. Looks very interesting, but does it work is the real question. It is already in the work with the same director. So lets wait and see how it corrects its mistakes. Meantime, you can watch this if you haven't yet, but it is an average film.5.5/10",Independence Day - Resurgence

49,tomgillespie2002,A splurge of digital nonsense that cares about nothing but filling its pockets,2,21 January 2017,"By the time the 300-mile wide alien spacecraft appears in the skies and touches down on our world, it had become quite clear that Independence Day: Resurgence, the belated sequel to the beloved 1996 disaster movie, was here simply for our money. For anyone expecting anything else but lifeless CGI akin to a video-game cut-scene and actors with less charisma than the beers I felt myself needing to consume throughout this complete waste of time and money will be sorely disappointed, but hardly surprised. The original Independence Day was just as daft and just as stupid, yet it had a charming innocence about it, which possibly stemmed from the sight of famous landmarks being obliterated before 9/11 made it slightly uncomfortable to watch some mindless carnage. It also had Will Smith, who probably read the script for Resurgence and decided that it was so bad that he opted to do Suicide Squad instead.Just like in real life, 20 years have past since those gigantic spaceships destroyed a host of major cities before being taken down by the combined efforts of... well, America. Just like in Alan Moore's Watchmen, the devastation caused by the alien race has brought humanity together, putting their differences aside to fight a common enemy. There's also been some amazing leaps in technology thanks to the debris left by the alien crafts, and a space station on the moon acts as humanity's first line of defence against another invasion. David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) is now one of the top figures in alien research, and when he meets up with African war- lord Umbutu (Deobia Oparei) in 'Central Africa', discovers that the defeated aliens sent a telepathic distress signal to their home planet 20 years ago. Umbutu receives some of these messages due to his close encounters with the creatures, as does former President Thomas Whitmore (Bill Pullman) and Dr. Brakish Okun (Brent Spiner).Of the new arrivals, there's the cocky and hunky hot-shot pilot Jake Morrison who, when we first meet him, is using his cockiness and hunkyness to save the space station from catastrophe. He is played by Liam Hemsworth, an actor I find utterly boring even in his better roles, who is clearly here for an easy payday since the script requires him to do little more than shout a defiant ""aaaaaaaagh!"" every time he faces danger in the cockpit. Jake is caught in some kind of squabble with Dylan Hiller (Jessie T. Usher), the son of Will Smith's character in the first film. Independence Day turned the Fresh Prince of Bel- Air into one the most bankable A-listers in the business, but Resurgence certainly won't be doing the same for Usher. He is one of many forgettable new faces in a packed ensemble which also includes President Whitmore's daughter (Maika Monroe), the current lady President (Sela Ward), the competent General Adams (William Fichtner), and Levinson's former flame Dr. Catherine Marceaux (Charlotte Gainsbourg in one of the greatest ever ""what the hell am I doing here?"" performances).While I recognise that development only occurred sporadically throughout the last 20 years, the best that the 5 (yes, 5) screenwriters behind Independence Day: Resurgence could come up with is to simply remake virtually everything that came before. There are shots of people gazing into the sky, landmarks turning into balls of flame, a dog-fight during which the enemies' weakness is exposed, a rousing Presidential speech which Pullman half-arses here, and Jeff Goldblum doing his Jeff Goldblum thang. The Force Awakens (2015) was criticised for doing the same, but at least it introduced a whole new bunch of likable characters and exciting set-pieces to distract us from this obvious flaw. Here, we get wise-cracks by Jake as millions of people die around him, and a climax that feels like the boss level from a computer game. And all without Will Smith. Simply put, Roland Emmerich's sequel is a boring, soulless ejaculation of digital nonsense that cares about nothing but filling its pockets with the cash of the unsuspecting.",Independence Day - Resurgence
50,Floated2,Emotionally and physically bland,2,9 April 2017,"Independence Day: Resurgence is the highly anticipated sequel to the smash cultural hit Independence Day, which was released in 1996. Several questions surfaced when this film finally came out and was in production, such as why did this sequel take 20 years to finally come out, and why was Will Smith's character not in this film.Independence Day: Resurgence is filled with several many supporting characters which take up important screen time. There are a few leads but overall this film is quite messy, uninteresting, confusing and bland for this type of fair. Despite the visuals being well done, the major problem is the characters weren't fleshed out as good as they could have been. This film feels as if it has been edited and cut down quite a few since their are several scenes that jump back and forth from one other. The characters weren't that interesting for us audience to truly sympathize what was occurring or wanting them to be safe and everyone happy. A lot of the film was severely confusing and not much seemed to be explained. Also, the actor portraying Will Smith's character's son was not well done, he lacked the natural charisma and emotional depth of Will Smith character. Liam Hemsworth appeared to be presented as the lead, but even so we didn't care too much for his character. Overall, this film as disappointed simply because it took the writers and studios 20 years to release this film and this was the greatest they came up with.

51,eddie_baggins,We waited 20 years for this?,1,1 November 2016,"In 1996 Independence Day, led by Will Smith and a cast of charismatic supporting actors, repelled a potentially earth destroying alien invasion that was both an entertaining spectacle (giving us the cinematic touchstone of an exploding White House), a fun and memorable popcorn munching ride and a film that seemed within itself to be having fun also.Fast forward to 2016 and despite the return of original director Roland Emmerich (whose once enjoyable career seems to be freefalling) and screenwriter Dean Devlin (plus 4 others!) as well as numerous cast members from the first film including Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman, Judd Hirsch and Brent Spiner and what we have with this long gestating and should've been locked away forever follow-up Insurgence, is a film that will go down as one of 2016's very worst.Devoid of any of the life that its 1996 forefather had, centred around an entirely tired and dull story and missing the charismatic presence of a leading man like Will Smith, Insurgence is the very worst of modern day blockbuster filmmaking and delivers nothing but the cardinal summer event film sin of being utterly boring and totally uninvolving no matter how many badly CGI'd events take place and hearkening back to the wins of the original are made.Misusing the elder statesman of the cast and offering up poor new substitutes with Liam Hemsworth's urinating pilot Jake Morrison, Jesse T. Usher's son of Will Smith Dylan Hiller and unfortunately the misuse of It Follows star Maika Monroe, Emmerich can neither find reasons for the return of the old cast or ways to make us care about the new members while despite the advancement in technology, the film itself lacks any of the stand-out set pieces or action ticks that made the first film such a joy and a film that to this day still finds a large audience enjoying it year to year.A sad excuse for a follow up to a film that in its own way is a great success and a generally terrible example of how to spend a $150 million worth of budget, Independence Day: Resurgence is a spectacular failure that fails to offer anything new, exciting or original and marks a sad occasion for all those who signed up to return, although it's not likely any returned for any other reason than a quick pay cheque. Will Smith must be thanking his lucky stars he too did not return for a second bout of alien butt kicking.After this effort, here's hoping that the aliens have given up on invading our fair shores for good.½ a celebrating alien out of 5",Independence Day - Resurgence
52,filipemanuelneto,Disastrous.,1,14 July 2021,"I confess that I was surprised that it was only twenty years later that ""Independence Day"" would have its sequel. It was one of those films that I considered already a museum piece, with a large group of admirers, but less and less frequent on cinema TV channels. But if there's one thing I've ever taken for granted, it's Roland Emmerich's delight when he gets the chance to destroy half the planet, an addiction that drives him to exploit any excuse to do so.The action takes place twenty years after the first film: Humanity came into contact with alien technologies that allowed a singular technological leap and the existence of a common enemy and an unparalleled destruction allowed the countries of the world to join forces as never before. Everything wonderful... but behold, the ugly evil aliens from the first movie are back, with a bigger spaceship, with more resources and committed to massacring Humanity and consuming global resources, like a plague of locusts. Once again, the US (who else?) has the arduous task of leading the world in a supreme effort to exterminate this threat... and this time, help will come from where least expected.The film starts off well, with very good premises, but after fifteen minutes it completely collapses and becomes a thing so lazy and uninteresting that it almost makes you want to turn off the TV. Emmerich seems so excited by the idea of annihilating the human race (he's done it several times) that he's not able to explore and develop well the initial premises of a united, peaceful, technologically advanced and suspicious world. We don't have the time or opportunity to see the way humanity has recovered from the initial attacks, and the way the US puts itself at the head of the world is arrogant and pretentious. The subplot of an intergalactic resistance, released in the middle of the film, was poorly used and is almost suspended, functioning basically as a hook for a third film, to be released.In a film so lacking in a story to tell, the action consists of incessant combats against space invaders, in a sci-fi action style without emotion, without heart, without any hint of humanity or suspense to make us adhere to what we are seeing. The actors' work comes down to basics: Liam Hemsworth is a cowboy, Maika Monroe is a pretty face, Sela Ward is dull, Jessie Usher is pretentious. Back to the characters from the first film, battered by age and arthritis, Bill Pullman, Brent Spinner and Jeff Goldblum have meticulously ruined their characters with scenes we won't want to see, like an ill Pullman eager to pilot a futuristic fighter jet, or Spinner in a gay-friendly reincarnation, walking through his laboratory with his naked butt, closely followed by his... husband?In the midst of this disaster, not even the effects are worth saving: grand, expensive, extravagant, the film is artificial and doesn't hide it for a second. It works a lot like an expensive video game: it's beautiful, it's elegant, it's flashy, it's fake like a thousand-euro bill, it has a lot of explosions and a dose of destruction that would drive insurance companies insane, but also the older clichés of the genre. The cinematography is good and there are many magnificent and very beautiful images, always computer made, off course.",Independence Day - Resurgence
53,leonblackwood,A poor sequel to a great original. 3/10,3,9 January 2017,"Review: This was one of the most anticipated movies this year but once Will Smith left the project, everyone's expectations went down. With Liam Hemsworth taking the lead as Jake Morrison, which was a terrible choice in my eyes, and Dylan Hiller (Jessie T. Usher) playing Will Smith's son, I really struggled to stay awake through this movie, and I personally wasn't that impressed with the acting. Jeff Goldblum (David Levinson) looked like he didn't want to be there most of the time, and Bill Pullman just looked like a right mess. The director tried to enter some complex elements to the plot, which went straight over my head, and I found the music throughout the movie, REALLY annoying. On the plus side, some of the CGI does look great, and the action scenes looked realistic but the alien looked to much like the Queen in the Alien franchise. Anyway, the movie is set 20 years in the future from the last alien attack, and America decides to build a space station called the ESD (Earth Space Defence) which is stationed on Earth, the Moon and Mars. The Aliens return to invade earth to cause mass destruction, after a distress signal was sent to them before they were defeated 20 years earlier, so the ESD have to use all of there power to defeat them. Bill Pullman (Whitmore), is no longer the president, and suffers with depression whilst his daughter Patricia (Maika Monroe) works for the ESD. During the attack from the aliens, Whitmore decides to take matters into his own hands, with the help of his daughter, while Jake and Dylan are fighting against the Aliens spaceships. There are other elements to the story but it just seemed like a load of technical jargon to me. Personally, I think the film was way too long and it seemed to drag after a while. There are a lot of unnecessary scenes and there wasn't much depth to the characters, who seemed to be dropping like flies throughout the movie. I also found it to cheesy and not that entertaining, and the so-called wit in the script, really wasn't that great. The new characters was a bad choice by the director and they didn't add anything new to the franchise, so I think you can tell that it gets the thumbs down from me. Disappointing!Round-Up: I think that this movie made a hefty profit at the box office, mainly because of the first movie, which I can watch time and time again. It was directed by Roland Emmerich, 61, who also brought you Universal Soldier, Stargate, Independence Day, Godzilla, The Patriot, The Day After Tomorrow, 10,000 BC, 2012, Anonymous, White House Down and Stonewall. He's obviously had a lot of experience behind the camera, so I'm surprised that he made a right mess of this movie. As he directed the first Independence Day, I thought he would have realised that the reason why it was so popular, was because of the witty aspect of the movie, which really didn't work in this film. With another Independence Day in the pipeline, I just hope that they bring something new to the table, because it feels like the franchise is going in the wrong direction.Budget: $165million Worldwide Gross: $390millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/adventure/sci-fi movies, starring Liam Hemsworth, Maika Monroe, Jeff Goldblum, Jessie T. Usher, Bill Pullman, William Fichtner and Judd Hirsch. 3/10",Independence Day - Resurgence
54,Tweetienator,Outdated & Redundant,3,26 July 2016,"I guess everyone knows this experience - you take an old book out of the shelves that you loved years ago and trying to reread it you just find it boring and wonder why even did you liked it in the first place. This movie is a total mess - Independence Day 2 is mediocre to bad in every aspect: story-telling, acting, cinematic and CGI. Even with the big budget for this movie it is mostly boring, predictable and redundant. All the jokes, the action + AMOUNTS of failures and inconsistencies in logic - too many to count. One example: the last survivor of the super-race of a defeated super-race gives the humans data for super-weapons - but how the f**** should this help to defeat the bad aliens if those super-race lost a century-long war against them!? Killing the one queen will draw attention to the other queens and there will be no time to develop super-guns and train the staff... Emmerich ofc is imo notoriously famous for movies drowned in inconsistencies, it's almost one of his trademarks. The whole movie just feels outdated too me: Emmerich still does the same movies like 10+ years ago. No development or progress - nada. Only bearable for fans of the franchise.",Independence Day - Resurgence

I thought it was pretty good but I didn't understand why it was such a huge movie. I only saw it the one time (that's pretty unusual for me). So when I watched ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" I spent to much time trying to remember who was in the original movie and who was missing. I should have been paying more attention to what was going on now, not then. Once I got over that hump, the movie really picked up steam. The last half hour so is really quite good. I will watch this one a second time. (I wish I saw this in 3D.)",Independence Day - Resurgence

57,matthewssilverhammer,Welcome to Earf 2,5,1 July 2016,"In 1996, Independence Day was somewhat unique: a giant-scale disaster film that's exciting, dramatic, and funny stood out in cinemas full of broad comedies, adult dramas, and smaller action flicks. Nowadays, we get an ID4-like every week. Where there once was a fantastical appeal to these CG destructo-fests, now all we notice are the massive amounts of dumb. So why does the original (in a mindless sort of way) still work, while Resurgence struggles to survive? Because as dumb as ID4 was, it had characters we know and like, something that's sorely missing here. Occurring in an alternate-universe-2016, the Earth has rebounded from the alien attack of '96 and has progressed scientifically and technologically in order to better prepare itself for the inevitable alien retaliation. And wouldn't ya know, those creepy space critters decided to return on the 4th of July AGAIN! Before they arrive, there are some mildly interesting character and plot developments that eventually give away to ill-matched dumb-fun. The action often feels like a non-narrative video game, the dialogue drips with bad exposition, and the cast is emotionally impenetrable. Most of all, it's desperately missing the comically light and ineffable presence of Will Smith, who they ill-advisedly keep bringing up. Despite all of this, there are still some silly, brainless, so-bad-it's-good fun times to be had. From a distance, the destruction looks good; there are moments when the ridiculous lore dips its toes into Star-Trek-level inspiration; and the alien design is still really awesome, with the giant mother alien being a welcome addition. Unfortunately, the goodwill of our nostalgia slowly wears away as the movie lumbers towards its sequel-baiting end.",Independence Day - Resurgence

The only good thing are the Jeff Goldblum oneliner jokes.,4,11 April 2019,"The only good thing about it: the Jeff Goldblum jokes. Those Goldblum jokes are badly needed to be able to bear this incredibly dumb movie.Independence Day Resurgence is testing my outmost ability to handle frustration, stupidity and excruciating boredom.The thing is that this movie starts out rather promising and the action aint bad either. Millions of dollars are spent on the action, so it does look good, but somewhere in the middle this movie just loses punch and focus and becomes a swamp of blockbuster mediocrity.",Independence Day - Resurgence

Fox, Brent Spiner, Sela Ward and Bill Pullman star in this 2016 sci-fi sequel. This takes place 20 years after the events of the original where the world has stuck together since and has advanced through the use of alien technology. Soon, it endures another invasion during it's anniversary and the human race must once again fight back. Goldblum (The Fly) returns as David, Hirsch (Taxi) as his father, Julius, Fox (Booty Call) as Jasmine, Spiner (Star Trek) as Dr. Okun and Pullman (Spaceballs) as former President, Whitmore. Hemsworth plays Jake, an air force pilot, Usher plays his friend, Dylan, the stepson of Will Smith's character, Steven who is also a pilot, Monroe (It Follows) plays Whitmore's daughter, Patricia who is engaged to Jake and Ward (The Fugitive) plays President Lanford. What can I say? This starts out OK, but drastically goes downhill and while it's nice to see the original cast members reprise their roles including a very brief appearance from the late, Robert Loggia (Scarface), this is basically a disappointing & unnecessary CGI rehash of the original.",Independence Day - Resurgence
60,subxerogravity,It's amazing how one movie can be so corny and so exciting at the same time!,7,24 June 2016,"Twenty years ago, when ID4 came out, I was pump like everyone else to see the Empire State building blow up (This was pre 9/11 of course), but Independence Day became a classic because it was all about us uniting in our darkest hour to become one and fight for the greater good. This movie concentrates on that latter more than the former.The suspense of the aliens coming was not as cool as the first movie. It was not as interesting as you think catching up with the old guard from the original and getting to know the new. Then things start blowing up, and it felt like the filmmakers were going after landmarks we did not see get blown up in the first film, and it was not that interesting.What was interesting is when the war between us an the aliens begins. That's also when it got real corn ball. Bill Pullman as former President Whitmore gives a more informal speech than he did in ID4 to rally the troops but he's not the only one who get a few lines that spread hope. It seem like everyone has trying for a tear jerking moment.Then the butt kicking begins on both sides, and that's when the movie gets live. It's interesting that I find the special effects better in the first one (or it could be the design of ID4 was better), but the battle scenes were top notch, very video gamy at times, but none the less, it was like Star Wars. Plus the aliens themselves get more screen time and it looks like the focus more on that with the effects. Without Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum leads the charge as a quirky leading man. Along side him is a large number of characters from the first movie, that give Resurgence the emotional ties needed. Then Liam Hemsworth leads the next gen heroes (most of which like Captain Dylan Hillier, were children in the first movie now all grown up), which is a real ensemble cast of characters who all get a chance to shine, making the sci-fi action movie even more epic.I have to mention, however that their corny attempts to create a united earth are very superficial. Unless I'm overreaching, Independence Day: Resurgence happens in a universe where 9/11 never happen, because the the first invasion made us whole before that event, making a Utopian time line (though one subplot evolves a peaceful, but tense cease fire with certain places in Africa where pieces of the mother ship landed and they had hand to hand battles with the aliens). It would have been nice to see a more imaginative angle of what that would have looked like. China does make an appearance in the movie, but that's only to assure the movie makes money in that country (assuming this is also why Angelababy, who I believe is a huge star over there is part of the main cast). I noticed America has a lot of technology while the people in the Middle East are living in caves and seem to be spectators in the fight. Am I asking too much that Mustafa Mohammed be part of the global battle in this Space opera fantasy?It would not have ruin the film for me, but maybe for others it would have interrupted the corny with a side o cheesy the delivery of July 4th being a world holiday is, but none the less it was worth watching in IMAX 3D. It will never be as mind blowing as cities across the globe have been destroyed numerous times in films since the twenty years that ID4 came out, but when Independence Day came out, some professional film critic called it ""this generation's Star Wars"" and Independence Day: Resurgence does a decent job trying to live up to that.",Independence Day - Resurgence
61,jtindahouse,Good pacing covers up for weak script and characters,6,29 June 2016,"As it becomes harder and harder for Hollywood to make money, we see them backing sequels more and more. If you had a favourite film 20 years ago that was a box office success and has never had a sequel, you can probably expect one in the coming years. Considering this, it's a wonder really that 'Independence Day: Resurgence' took this long to be made. I read in the trivia section that it took them this long to come up with a strong enough story to base the sequel around. Really? I find that hard to believe considering the product we've been given is almost identical to the original and has almost no creative plot points that a 10-year-old couldn't have come up. That's not to say it's a bad film. It's really not. As far as sci-fi actions goes, all you can really hope to be is entertained for the entire duration of the film. This movie ticks that criteria. Director Roland Emmerich, prolific in the 'disaster movie' genre, has been there all too many times and knows how to pace his movies. He rarely creates anything overly thought-provoking or game-changing, but he does know how to entertain. The script is lacking in creativity and a lot of the dialogue isn't very well written. You'll hear a lot of one-liners that will leave you thinking - was that supposed to be funny? The film is also missing Will Smith big time. He made the original what it was back when he was at the peak of his powers. Now, 20 years later, we get Liam Hemsworth as our star. A downgrade is an understatement. He has no charisma and actually becomes very annoying as the movie goes on. He's lucky that there's enough other characters and enough action to cover up his very poor performance. Altogether though it's not a complete miss, just one that could have been a lot better with more attention to detail.",Independence Day - Resurgence
62,RodrigAndrisan,Resurgence is not a good title because there is no resurgence,4,26 June 2016,"Usually, German directors are smart, not this time. This film would be more appropriately called stealing a little bit from here and a little bit from there. So, we take a Jeff Goldblum exactly how he was left in ""Jurassic Park"", we ad a Liam Hemsworth with less beard than in ""The Hunger Games"", a Bill Pullman like in all his films before and, to have also some French deja-vu, we ad some Charlotte Gainsbourg. We mix everything with some monsters-aliens like in the ""Alien/Aliens"" franchise plus many many other insipid human characters, and we smother everything in a music stolen almost note for note from ""Star Wars"" and ""Superman"": we got a new Hollywood production, good appetite, enjoy your meal(sorry, I wanted to write enjoy your mess...), beware to not choke!",Independence Day - Resurgence
63,jamesrupert2014,About what I expected...,6,10 February 2017,"I liked the first Independence Day movie more than the most people (judging by the IMDb rating) and the same is true for this one. That said, this film is not particularly good. The special effects are adequate but, considering that 20 years have passed, are not any more effective than those in the original. I didn't watch in 3D, so perhaps the endless swirling 'debris' scenes were lost on me. The acting basically combined the shtick from the first one (Goldblum, Spiner and Hirsch) with currently obligatory young, reckless, rebel-hero stereotypes. The ending is a painful setup for #3, which I will no doubt watch, despite, I suspect, its continuing the usual downhill sequel slide. Too bad, I really like giant spaceship stories.",Independence Day - Resurgence

I'm surprised that there was gonna be a sequel, Independence Day for me I always thought never needed a sequel, but I saw it just to see if it would be has entertaining.It was not has over the top has the first one, but the effects are good, never seem dated. The actors all play there parts very well, Liam Hemsworth as a cocky pilot, basically a cross between Han Solo and Maverick(Top Gun), Brent Spiner returns surprisingly has eccentric scientist, they really up his part. Jeff Goldblum gets back in his role, like he never left. Bill Pullman is also good here, so was Judd Hirsch. Not a great film, but if you saw the first film, you'll know what to expect here, simply entertaining.",Independence Day - Resurgence
65,freemantle_uk,Unnecessary,4,6 August 2016,"Independence Day was a quintessentially 90s movies, a big event back in 1996 and a special effects showcase that still hold up today. It is still enjoyed today, even if most people are wearing their nostalgia goggles and it did not require a sequel. However Hollywood doesn't let issues like that stop them if there's an opportunity to make money.It is 20 years since the nations of Earth united and repelled an alien invasion that devastated the world. Since that time Earth has rebuild using alien technology and form the Earth Space Defense force whose mission is to stop any future alien invasion. As Earth is about to remember the 20th anniversary of the attack people who have had contact with the aliens start to have visions that the aliens are going to come back and low-and-behold they do with even more force. Old heroes and new have to find a way to find a way to save humanity for a second time.The original Independence Day was a big hit partly because it extraordinary feat of special effects, combining state-of-the-art CGI for the alien space ships and aerial battles and good old-fashioned model work, getting the best of both. It was big budget B-Movie, both a disaster movie and an alien invasion flick. It was a huge scale movie with a big cast and was served with a big slice of American cheese (even though it was directed by a German). It was a silly film but it was made with heart. The same cannot be said about its sequel.While the original blended various special effects techniques Independence Day: Resurgence was a CGI heavy blockbuster in a weak summer of blockbusters. The CGI was excellent for the most part but it does not replace the magic of the models and at times weightless because it was just created in a computer allowing for ridiculous sights like cities falling on top of other cities. It's hard to recapture the awe of the first movie destruction and ""Resurgence"" certainly unable to match that quality. ""Resurgence"" effects were more like Roland Emmerich's previous disaster film 2012.The original film was set in a recognisable world, it was mid-90s America. The sequel may as well be Star Trek because of all the alien-tech. All of Earth's cities had to be rebuild and given a futuristic twist, there is a moon base with giant laser cannons, high-tech command centres and the uniforms the military wear are nothing like what real military officials really wear. There is logic behind the filmmakers decides but it results in us not caring for the world because it is so different to the one we know. The cities are artificial and most of the film takes place in military bases, the outside world is barely glimpsed upon. There are also some inconsistencies: the film shows humanity using futuristic trains and helicopters yet people still drive normal cars - not just citizens but the UN as well.Independence Day: Resurgence tries to replicate some of the key scenes and ideas of its predecessor like the destruction of a major city, the retaliation battle where the humans are outnumbered, having a hotshot pilot exiled to an outpost and even the climax. As well as lifting from its own previous film Independence Day: Resurgence also take ideas from Transformers: Dark of the Moon and Man of Steel where the aliens forces are destroying the planet for their own benefits with their big device and the good guys need to stop them in the nick of time and the set-pieces with world leaders talking to each other on video monitors was like 2012. The subplot where the action takes place in Africa shows African warlords had battled the reminding aliens and it has altered their culture like the Nigerians in District 9.Like Emmerich's previous disaster movies Independence Day: Resurgence has a huge cast of characters who spread across the world and often thinning defined. Jeff Goldblum is a delight as David Levinson, the man who is often the smartest guy in the room and Bill Pullman's former president Whitmore has been driven insane because of his physic connection to the aliens. Brent Spiner also returns despite his character seemingly being killed off in first film and Judd Hirsch may as well not have bothered returning to the series because his character does nothing in the film. The new actors like Liam Hemsworth and Jessie Usher are okay in the roles as two of the main pilots but don't do much to stand out. Hemsworth had more to work with because his character was similar to Will Smith's in the original film. ""Resurgence"" also gives supporting roles to Angelababy and Ng Chin Han, casting decisions to appeal to the lucrative Asian market.Two characters who should have been shot were Charlie the pilot (Travis Tope), Jake's (Hemsworth) best friend and trying to woo Angelababy's character because she is a hot new Chinese girl on the base and Floyd (Nicolas Wright), Levison's pencil pushing assistant who has to become a fighter. Both characters are meant to be a comic relief but really characters you would want the aliens to kill.Independence Day: Resurgence is unrelentingly stupid. Some may describe it as 'turn your brain off movie' but ""Resurgence"" takes too many leaps for even that justification this approach. The film aims to be bigger than the previous film and does it in the silliest way possible and tries to expand its universe. My personal favourite dumb moment is when an African war lord fights an alien with a couple of machetes.This sequel was unnecessary and the screenplay needed serious trimming before it should have been made. There are some fun moments but it's the type of film you laugh at rather than laugh with.",Independence Day - Resurgence
66,Stevieboy666,I know it's cliche but that's 2 hours of my life that I'll never get back!,3,17 August 2019,"Twenty years on from the original movie, which I thought was very over rated, Earth once again comes under attack from aliens.
Special effects play a BIG part in Resurgence, it is pretty much non-stop. Some are good whilst others look cheap. Either way, this film is silly, cheesy and boring. I can only assume that it was meant to be comical, though I didn't find it's cheap humour very funny. Granted, watching this on the big screen would have been better but I certainly would have felt cheated paying to watch this. At least watching movies like this at home means there's the ability to pause now and then, to get up and have a walk around, thereby breaking up the tedium.
Poor. It looks like a Sci Fi Channel movie, only with a much bigger budget.",Independence Day - Resurgence
67,stevendbeard,Passing the Franchise to the Younger Generation,7,24 June 2016,"I saw ""Independence Day:Resurgence"", starring Liam Hemsworth-The Hunger Games movies, The Expendables 2; Jessie T. Usher-When the Game Stands Tall, Survivor's Remorse_tv; Maika Monroe-The 5th Wave, Labor Day and Sela Ward-Gone Girl, The Day After Tomorrow.This is a sequel to the 1996 original 'Independence Day'-Wow, 20 years later! It's directed by the same director, too, Roland Emmerich-besides the original, he has directed White House Down, The Day After Tomorrow, Stargate and Universal Soldier. Not too bad of a resume. Most of the original cast return-Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, Judd Hirsch, Robert Loggia, Brent Spiner and Vivica A. Fox-but since it has been 20 years, they are passing the franchise along to the younger generation. FYI: Notably missing from the original cast is Will Smith. I heard that there was a money issue, with Will wanting $50 million. In case you miss him, they do show pictures of Will, as a hero of the alien battle of '96. They say he was killed testing out an alien hybrid ship. The connections between the young and the old actors are; Liam lost his parents in the first movie so he is an orphan and now a hot shot pilot. He is also engaged to Maika, who is the daughter of former President Bill, which would make him the son-in-law to Bill. Jessie is another hot shot pilot and the son of deceased Will and Vivica. Sela is the new President- foreshadowing of Hillary Clinton, maybe? As far as plot goes, the alien technology recovered from the first film has been incorporated to improve ours. We now have bases on our moon, Mars and moons of Saturn-We gotta keep an eye out for any returning aliens. And, of course they do return, bigger and badder. There mother ship lands on Earth and covers the whole Atlantic ocean! Seems like no hope for us, but lucky for us, we have Liam and company. Lots of destruction and famous monuments being destroyed. And I also heard that Roland has announced a 3rd installment is in the works. It's rated ""PG-13"" for sci-fi action and destruction and language and has a running time of 2 hours. I enjoyed this one and would buy it on DVD.",Independence Day - Resurgence
68,XweAponX,"""We're gonna kick some serious Alien Arse!""",8,31 July 2016,"After 20 years, ""Mr Data"" (Brent Spiner) has returned as Dr Brackish Ogun, the butt-scratching former director of Area 51.Okay, okay! I rated this 10 initially, but I have to revise my rating. I'll give it an ""8"" - ONLY because I enjoyed it, despite it's flaws. And, mostly because of Brent Spiner, who for me was the highlight of this film, it was a remarkable resurrection of the character. I wish the rest of the film had been better, but a film really has to be bad for me to give lower than a ""5"". and this film is no way as bad as Justin Beeber's ""I Believe""As far as the film, NO, it was nowhere near as well done as ID4, which even with it's primitive CGI, the practical elements and composition of that film gave us a more realistic image of the immensity of the Alien Mother-ship and the 13-mile wide invasion ships. What's missing in this film was the ominous covering of NYC by one of the ships: When Jeff Goldblum sees the ship edge on as it approaches, the sheer size. Even with the magnitude of the new Alien ships, that image of hopelessness was missing in this film.But it was still enjoyable, including the appearances of former ID4 actors, RIP Robert Loggia.What I liked was the further exploration of the nature of our Alien Visitors, a kind of history is given. It seems that the Mother-ship that visited us 20 years ago was minor, compared to what we see in this film. But I did not believe it as much this time.That is the main point of any of these alien invasion blockbusters, how much we believe what we see. The 90's was perhaps the last decade where impossible special effects were produced practically, with a little help from Apple Computers and CGI. But since 1996, the state of computer hardware has developed so that CGI can be done faster, better, and most importantly, cheaper than it was done in the 90's. But too much CGI I think takes away from the overall effect. Practical effects, well, they look real, because they are real. And as well as the CGI was done here, it lacked the texture of practical effects. Ingenious composition was what made it work so well in the first film, here, they used CGI to do it all.This film lost most of that magic, that cleverness. But it still had some good points, some good characters, some good dialogue. Again, not as good as ID4. The Last time Dean Devlin worked with Roland Emmerich was probably in ""The Patriot"" as a producer. Between them, they owned the 90's with several blockbusters. In the meantime, other directors appeared and took over, now there are too many to count.It was my initial love of ID4 that allowed me to accept this as a sequel, the original actors, Jeff Goldblum, Vivica A Fox, Judd Hirsch, and especially Bill Pullman, all have aged well. And worked well with new actors, Liam Hemsworth and Jessie T. Usher (as Dylan Hiller).One thing that was kind of absurd was the appearance of an ""Alien Queen"" - which looked ironically like James Cameron's Alien Queen from ""Aliens"". Also, she had a mouth, the aliens in ID4 had no mouths. I guess she ""speaks"" for all of them.But I liked how 20 years of progress with alien technology was shown. Moon bases, fighter ships using alien propulsion, area 51 being expanded. The inference that there must have been Aliens left on the ground in every country, there must have been a time where these were all being fought and gathered up. And a Warlord from Africa, played by Deobia Oparei, who could read the alien's language due to two decades of fighting them on the ground, hunting them and learning how to properly kill them. But most importantly, understanding a recurring symbol in the alien language, and what it really meant. Which lead directly to Brackish Ogun creating a personal relationship with an unexpected ally. Who was a virtual intelligence of sorts, just like Mr Data, played by Brent Spiner for over 20 years.This film did not and could not exploit Apple Computers (Or any other modern day tech products), which had been part of the solution of the first ID4. Because in this ""alternate history"", Hollywood was Destroyed and took The X-Files with it, probably as well as Cupertino and the Apple Offices. So we didn't see any modern day computer gadgets, no iPhones, no iPads, not even an Android tablet or device. But plenty of Chinese tech. ""QQ"", a Chinese company, has taken over the void left by the destruction of ATT and Sprint. So we really didn't see any identifiable 2016 tech, not even an iPhone SE. Maybe in this time-line, alien computer tech has been incorporated into the tech we are shown. But the aliens are still able to knock out our satellite network, because we weren't the only ones who had ""upgrades"".If I consider what would have happened if ID4 was real, I think the world would have reacted the same way, especially if dozens of 13-mile wide alien ships had crashed all over, we would have exploited the tech. And the world might looked like what we see here. And like in this film, we would have underestimated the ability of the aliens to update their own tech. Which goes to show, if an alien ship appears in a warp-funnel and it looks nothing like the ones that came before, we should not shoot it down.",Independence Day - Resurgence
69,alindsay-al,A below average disappointing alien invasion film,4,30 June 2016,"After 20 years we finally have the sequel to independence day with resurgence and this film is really disappointing because it is pretty dull. The premise sees after 20 years the aliens are coming back to destroy our world. Jeff goldblum is back as David and he is great in this film, he is easily the best actor in this film and he gives a really fun performance. Bill Pullman is back as president Whitmore and he does a good job, he isn't in the film allot but when he is he is good. William fichtner joins the cast as a general and he gives a good performance integrating well with the older cast. Unfortunately, though I didn't really care for any of the new cast. Liam hemsworth is just not as good as his brother Chris and just gives a pretty bland performance. James t usher plays Dylan hiller the son of will Smiths character in the first film and he just gives a really bland performance that comes across as wooden. Maika Monroe plays Pullmans daughter in the film and I just didn't really connect with the character throughout the film. The story is incredibly simple and lazy, the film gives ridiculous reasons for the whole invasion. Also there are way too many characters and story arcs in this film that just incredibly bog this film down and some of them feel like they shouldn't even be in this film. The script is really cheesy and basic and unlike the first film this film lacks humour and a spark that smiths character added. The style has obviously allot of good cgi for the action scenes, however, during the space battles the screen is flooded with mess on the screen and it is really hard to focus on what is going on. Overall this is a below average film that isn't really worth a watch.",Independence Day - Resurgence

71,sauravjoshi85,This is not resurgence but a devolution.,2,3 May 2021,"Independence Day: Resurgence is an Sci-Fi action movie directed by Roland Emmerich and stars Liam Hemsworth, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman, Maika Monroe, Jessie Usher, William Fichtner, Charlotte Gainsbourg and Judd Hirsch.If there is any competition between all the worst sequels this movie will surely be the front line contender with some clichéd dialogues and mediocre screenplay this movie is surely an outright example of an chaotic sequel.Twenty years after the first invasion the earth is been attacked by the same aliens and had again chose the same date but this time they had planned much more destruction.The plot of the movie is quite similar to its predecessor and apart from some technological advance machinery the makers are still stucked in the execution of 1996 flick. From the start till the climax the movie is predictably badly executed.The screenplay of the movie is very predictable pathetic and cringe worthy. Acting is bad to very bad and it seems that the characters were still living in the era of 1996. Emotionally also the movie fails miserably to connect the audience with its first part despite of repeating the core cast. The climax of the movie is also predictably and acts as final nail in the coffin. Personally I am a great admirer of the work of Roland Emmerich but this time this movie is a big let down.

74,aharmas,"Interesting Premise, Botched Execution",5,28 June 2016,"How does it go? ""Too many cooks..."" There is so much going on in this movie, and everything is going in a thousand directions. There's not much time given to the development of characters, fleshing out the story, or trying somehow to giving the film a bit of logic. A 3,000 mile wide spaceship, and we still have a chance? Our savior's ship, which is even more sophisticated than the other one is dispatched in seconds? Doesn't that queen bug look awfully familiar? Maybe it's time to start looking for new ideas and taking a little longer so that immense amounts of cash are not thrown out. I did like the last line, and even that might not go anywhere and could be polished a little bit.How did we get back to the ultimate battle? 20 some years have gone by, and those nasty aliens are back, looking forward to getting even or being defeated again by a way less developed civilization, with way less ammunition, or at times, logical thought.So, a humongous spaceship shows up, with thousands of soldiers, destroying half the world, just by landing on the ocean. It would appear that there is not much hope for the planet, until one of the good ideas in the story line pops when a much, much advance civilization makes a brief appearance, only to disappear again the muddled storyline. Before we reconnect with the potential secret weapon (yes, it must stay secret), we're treated to more grating and severely atrophied discourse between what might or not be the leads in the story.There's no Will Smith, but we get some of the old faces, and Sela Ward makes for a lively president that doesn't belong with the rest of the confusing gallery of underdeveloped characters. Later on, with a twist that is bound to ruffle a few feathers, we get a hint of humor and sensitive when a relationship is explained a little bit. However, there's very little to cheer here.If the story continues to unfold, there might be a hint of hope, if we only let one good writer and a good director take over, and maybe take us where this premise has never taken us before.",Independence Day - Resurgence

There is nothing new on offer here, save the updated special effects, which, whilst impressive, fail to mask the overall ""beige-ness"" of this film. Its a cheesy affair from the schmaltzy introduction which looks like it was culled from a saccharine political campaign broadcast, through to the predictable warmongering aliens and the syrupy, hero moments.

76,peterp-450-298716,"Bigger, slicker and more devastating. But such a pity. It's silly and grotesque too.",6,1 October 2016,"""Are we dead? We're okay. You peed in your pants? Uh, yeah. Yeah, me too.""I never thought I would miss Will Smith in a movie. Well, for everything there's a first time. And damn, I missed our friend Smith in this sequel of the blockbuster from 1996. Not because of his acting talent or his good looks. But because of his dry humor and his sometimes hyperactive behavior. Smith was honored by the brief display of a picture somewhere in a presidential corridor. His absence in this film was due to a fatal accident during a test flight (Personally I think the paycheck was a disappointment to him). As a worthy successor his stepson Dylan (Jessie T. Usher and fortunately not Smith's son Jaden himself) is summoned to help.The big difference with its predecessor, is the total lack of credibility and excitement. In the blockbuster of 1996, the alien invasion was so brilliantly portrayed, that if we ever expect something to happen like this, it'll look exactly the same. In this movie everything is so over the top and out of proportion, that it starts to look ridiculous. For instance the dimensions of the alien ship. This giant ship covers almost a quarter of the planet. The advantage is that the devastation and ravages are so immense that the images of destruction are really impressive. I'm sure the CGI department was asked to get the maximum out of their computer systems. When those immense landing gears of the colossal spaceship dig into the earth's surface, it provides hallucinatory images. Quite some mainland is plowed and a huge tsunami hurtles across the continents. Compared to this, the one in ""San Andreas"" was a tiny wave.About the story itself. Don't expect too much content or groundbreaking innovations compared to the previous one. It's more or less a second attempt of the alien warlords to conquer Earth and plunder resources. The only difference is that by studying the extraterrestrial material, left behind after the first confrontation, mankind has been able to develop their scientific knowledge drastically. The result is a mega plant on the moon in order to counter new attacks. The creation of a futuristic-looking society. A defense system around our planet by means of armed satellites. And the technology for intergalactic traveling at light speed. However, they didn't realize that twenty years ago a distress signal was sent from an alien ship, situated in the African desert where African rebels waged a long war against Martians which were wandering in the desert. They researched alien technology thoroughly. But the disorder in the X-band frequency detected the moment the mother ship was destroyed, apparently was a hard nut to crack . The result is a second attack. An unstoppable attack according to former President Whitmore (Bill Pullman) : ""They are coming back. And this time we won't be able to stop them"".The cast is a mixture of veterans who appeared in the old movie and a new generation. So you can see Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman, Judd Hirsch and Brent Spiner again, as their twenty year older alter ego. Their appearance reminds you again how fast years flew by. Their intelligence is still as fresh and spry as before. Most problems are solved in an instant by shrewd proposals and intuitive inventions. A little too quickly in my opinion. This made it quite implausible. And this way the tension was completely ruined. Furthermore, I couldn't really appreciate the sometimes corny humor. All in all, this second film is a little bit of a setback. Granted, the images look spectacular. The special effects are majestic (but that was to be expected). And the action scenes are phenomenal. But there was no magical moment in this film. It wasn't really that impressive. But when you fancy a visual spectacle, this blockbuster should be on your bucket list. I just hope the descendants of those pesky aliens won't come up with the same idea in 20 years.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",Independence Day - Resurgence
77,Enchorde,Decent sci-fi action in reunion party,6,1 September 2018,"Twenty years ago aliens attacked and nearly devastated the Earth. Now they are back with a vengeance. Not only to destroy Earth, but to enure their galactic supremacy. Now we humans (and by we I of course mean the american air force) must save Earth and the entire galaxy.The first part of this duo of movies was an action-packed sci-fi spectacular with an ridiculous amount of patriotic flag waving (the American flag that is). So when they return twenty years later with basically the same premise, little new is expected. And, sure enough, it is a good paced action even if it don't really get to the level the original did. It is a copy, with almost no new ideas incorporated. Although the flag waving is toned down a bit, you cannot wonder how this supposedly now united earth and their army) almost exclusively consists of americans (and a few token other nationalities). Anyhow, it is entertaining, just don't expect too much. The only thing that actually surprised me was how much of the original cast that returned for this move. Usually, when movies get sequels or remakes after two decades they are replaced or given only minor token roles. Not this time. Of couse they are supported by some new talents, but it is basically the same team fighting again (except Will Smith).

80,jadepietro,Independence Day: Regurgitation,1,7 January 2017,"(RATING: ☆)THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.JIM'S REVIEW: They're back! Ten years later in Earth time and twenty years in the future with the dismal sequel, Independence Day: Resurgence comes off life support and into a theater near you. Misdirected by Roland Emmerich and written by a committee of five that included Mr. Emmerich, Dean Devlin, Nicolas Wright, James A. Woods, and James Vanderbilt, the film is a dud.The aliens want revenge again and so will any moviegoer who sits through this dumb sci-fi adventure. The various one dimensional characters are put through their paces as they face perils to undo the invader's plot. And the film's plot defies logic as well. The CGI effects are sub-par, the kind one could easily find in a video game. There is so much mayhem per inch on the screen that it is hard to see the action at times. Lots of sound and explosions with no real impact.Beside the poor writing and dialog that is more endless exposition, there are enough OMG apocalyptic moments that are borderline laughable. As the film battles progress, so does the absurdity, especially when a magic yellow school bus successfully evades an attacking alien mother-lode. Paging Miss Sweeney!The acting is dreadful throughout. Will Smith is wisely DOA in this revival, but Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman, William Fichtner, Charlotte Gainsbourg, and Sela Ward are completely wasted in their ill-fitting roles. Judd Hirsch plays his Jewish schtick too thick, as if he is playing Tevye to the last seat in the balcony while Brett Spiner, donning a long gray fright wig, plays a dotty scientist awakened from a 20 year coma. There is another ham in his performance for a sandwich at the Carnegie Deli. Liam Hemsworth relies too much on his good looks to carry him through another film role and Jessie Usher, Maika Monroe, and Travis Tope provide passing interest for the younger crowd.Independence Day: Resurgence is awful, simply one of the worst sequels ever made.

As someone who watched the first movie as a kid, and got amazed by it, I must say that this movie is a fifty-fifty for me. It's half good because it continues on a story that I liked as a child. And further, watching this with my friends makes the movie a good talk material. But as someone who has seen a lot of movies, I'm a bit disappointed. The movie blatantly follows suit on the current pattern of Hollywood sequels to make the next movie bigger and larger, all without paying justice to the original story. Nowhere in the original movie speak about a queen or sorts. Anyway it makes the aliens to common as other alien movies have used the premise before. And killing off Will Smith's character, just because he's now an expensive actor is really a bad idea in my view.",Independence Day - Resurgence
82,rgkarim,"Flashy, Rushed, and Ridiculousness:",6,25 June 2016,"We've had 20 years to prepareso have they. It's a tag line that has rang through the theaters for the last year and this weekend the bad, intergalactic, space bugs from 1996 have returned with a vengeance. Hi Robbie K here, and today we review yet another summer sequel entitled Independence Day: Resurgence. As always, I'm here to share my thoughts, ideas, and opinions to inform whether this sequel is a success or a flop. Let's get started. The GOOD:  Action scenes better animated  Original cast rocks the screen  ComedyBack in 1996, I remember being wowed by the ""state-of-the-art"" graphics the first installment brought in. Watching the planes take on the big bad pod ships used to have me on the edge of my seat and cheering in delight. Well twenty years gave us plenty of time to prepare better special effects and the battles are an even better display of computer processing power. The new combat ships fly much smoother, the explosions are much bigger, and the laser blasts are even more multicolored on the big screen. While the art design is a little hokey at points, the visuals are geared towards more exciting action moments, hoping to bring more detail to yet another 3-D showing. It's flashy and over the top to say the least, but it certainly lives up to what the trailer promised. But even better for this critic was seeing the characters from 20 years back in the seat. The original cast (for the most part) made up the quality parts of the movie. Jeff Goldblum dives right back into his character bringing both satirical comedy with serious ""science"" to try and save our cans again. Bill Pullman as the president also carries the same, over zealous, patriotic spirit that united our world to fight against the menace from the sky. But it was Brent Spiner as Dr. Okun (the crazy haired anatomy who supposedly died in the first film) whose roll I mostly enjoyed. The original cast just brought the nostalgia back to me and helped keep me grounded in the ridiculous plot unfolding. The new characters weren't bad mind you, and the younger cast has a promising future, but their characters were more sex appeal than anything else. Yet the thing that was most entertaining in this filmwas the comedy. I know, not what you expect right, but Independence Day 2 brought more comedic punch than anything else. Spiner's character is like something out of the Big Bang where curiosity, obsession, and nerdiness are unleashed with a Sheldon Cooper presentation. The quirky one-liners, extremely silly drama, and slapstick humor was indeed entertaining for me, albeit distracting from the goal of the film. There are plenty of other pot shot comments and moments through the film involving unnecessary tangents (like sailors getting drunk) to impromptu parenting that are all there to relieve the ""tension"" that was built up. The BAD  Not as suspenseful  Lacks emotional punch/connection  The Story for Pete's sakeIndependence Day 2's weaknesses start with the lack of suspense. I remember in the first movie being scared stiff as the clock ticked away to some unknown move by the creatures, or in that terrifying alien surgery scene. But in this movienothing of the sort happened. This usually is the case when 3-D computer visuals are the focus, and ID2 is another example of flashy special effects diluting the suspense they meant to bring. But the suspense is not the only thing lacking in this movie. Again in the first film, I remember being sad or angry when characters were eliminated (poor Jimmy). You felt the punch in the gut, but scream/cry out in frustration. This film didn't even come close to that for me. Key characters, who we had little time to get acquainted with, were lost in the most rushed ways that you didn't have time to process the emotions before being whisked to another flashy display. Oh well, who needs emotion in a science fiction right? That seems to be the thought these days.Perhaps the thing that robbed the movie of all these qualities though was the ridiculous story of ID2. I know the first installment was not the most realistic, and had plenty of plot holes and cheesiness to meet your fill. However, this sequel took all that and amplified ten fold. The plot essentially had too much it tried to accomplish, trying to make everything bigger, badder, and bolder while still trying to capture the nostalgia. In my opinion, they put too much emphasis on the bigger aspect, making the giant ship ridiculously giant to cover the entire Atlantic is just one example of the over the top antics that failed to deliver. They might have been able to deliver on the threat, but I feel they tried to jam too much into the film that they failed to bring any strong plot to the mix. And they way they ended, I shudder to think of how cornier the next installment is going to be. The Verdict:Surprise, surprise, Independence Day Resurgence is not quite the sequel we were hoping it would be. The over the top grandiosity and rushed pace fail to deliver a semi decent plot, and the comedy, while enjoyable, only further dilutes from taking this film seriously. While the visuals are certainly the strongest aspect, and the original characters breathe some life into the blandness, they took too much emphasis in my opinion. And that endinga rushed, convenient sweep up that robbed me of any satisfaction whatsoever. Based on this review you can guess that the only redeeming quality for a theater visit is the special effects. This reviewer however, encourages you to wait for this to hit home. Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 7.0 (for the action) Movie Overall: 5.5-6.0",Independence Day - Resurgence
83,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Independence Day: Resurgence,4,25 June 2016,"In Independence Day: Resurgence (my latest review), twenty years has passed. Guess what, the aliens are still ticked off and looking for some sweet revenge. Now does that concept have to be so complicated? The five dudes hired to pen the script for ""Resurgence"" sure think so. This sequel to 1996's original Independence Day will give you a headache. Gone is the first film's feel of a popcorn flick, gone is Roland Emmerich's ability to shoot coherent action sequences this time around, gone is ID4's Will Smith (that might have been a good decision on Will's part), and gone from the first film is well, the fun. Independence Day: Resurgence has too many sci-fi ideals, too many characters, and way too many subplots (a mothership drilling a hole in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean is one of several). Sure the CGI in the first outing seemed a little dated but at least it got the job done. Oh yeah, did I mention that the editing is sloppy too.Personally, I think Independence Day should of had a sequel come out ten years ago. With the passing of two decades, too much time has gone by. ""Resurgence"" almost feels like it has no true connection or transition from 1996's original. Most of the troupers from the first installment are gone and their absence is never fully explained (Margaret Colin, James Duval, Harry Connick Jr., Adam Baldwin, and of course The Fresh Prince). The actors/actresses that do stay on board aren't exactly fleshed out as characters. Bill Pullman's ex-President (Thomas J. Whitmore) is now a bearded whack job, Vivica A. Fox's Jasmine went from a stripper to being a doctor (nice), Brent Spiner's Dr. Okun is in a coma, and Jeff Goldblum's David Levinson is off somewhere in Central Africa. What happened earlier to these people is a mystery that we the audience, have to figure out. And how mind you did the 2016 of Independence Day: Resurgence turn into the world of Blade Runner? The 2016 we presently live in doesn't look all technical and ultra-modern. We don't have roving space vehicles, two hour trips to the moon, a Starship Troopers- like environment, and thousands of laser guns. Just saying.As for the special effects, well in ""Resurgence"" they aren't bad. In the first Independence Day however, simplicity and attention to detail payed off much better. You don't see hardly any landmarks being blown up this time (previously it was The White House, the Empire State Building, the Capital Records Building, and the U.S. Bank Tower). I mean yeah a random city (or two) bites the dust but it happens so quickly. Nothing has time to completely resonate in the mind's eye. Buildup is also absent in ""Resurgence"" because in the first flick, you waited nervously to see what was going to happen to our world, you know the destruction and humorous paranoia of it all. With Independence Day: Resurgence, there's no anticipation of life termination and no one seems to be in that much danger because disaster sequences are cut so sparingly. They come off as remote and off-key.In terms of ""Resurgence's"" Star Wars-like dogfights which carry over from 1996, well Emmerich feels the need to make them too chaotic. You don't know which protagonist is shooting at which antagonist, what spaceship is flying where, and what extraterrestrial species is the head honcho or not. And when an important character dies (like Madam President Sela Ward (spoiler)), we don't know how or if it actually happened. Finally, did I mention the geography in ""Resurgence""? Oh yeah, most of the actresses, actors, and side extras globetrot all over the country and/or planet Earth (the Moon too). You lose track of where they are at any given moment. Presidents, the First Daughter, pilots, scientists, and lieutenants go from point a to point b so quickly you'd think they beamed themselves up like in Star Trek. Basically, this thing is a mess.Bottom line: Independence Day: Resurgence is 25 minutes shorter than the original Independence Day. It still manages to be less entertaining, polarizing, a little slower, and much more convoluted. If you think you're entering the theater to see a summer blockbuster, think again. Highly ambitious, highly elaborate, and highly budgeted ($165 million) doesn't always mean better. And by the way, do you remember the original Independence Day when Jeff Goldblum uttered the words, ""don't say oops""? Funny. The last word of that quote is what I said immediately after leaving ""Resurgence's"" 4:30 showtime. Rating: 1 and a half stars.Of note: My favorite line in the original Independence Day involved a woman welcoming the aliens on top of a skyscraper by saying, ""oh gosh, I hope they bring back Elvis"". That got a laugh from me. Sadly, the hilarity in ""Resurgence"" is attempted again by unknown actors and it just doesn't feel the same. Bummer.",Independence Day - Resurgence

86,bkrauser-81-311064,So Awful,2,12 July 2016,"Hey remember 1996? It certainly was a more innocent time back then; Sega still made game consoles, Pauly Shore was still a successful, if puzzling comedic phenomenon and there were only 150 Pokemon. The largest film of that summer: Independence Day (1996), a one-off riff on fiendishly clever 1960's alien invasion films. The film was built on the same reliable stock characters, buoyant, optimistic flag waving and simplistic them versus us story-beats as Earth Vs. the Flying Saucers (1956). Only this time it was done with an unheard of budget of 75 million dollars and came armed with a bevy of charismatic performances by actors who all seemed to be in on the joke.With Independence Day: Resurgence, the joke is clearly on us. It's a boring, soulless oddity whose mere existence is an insult to remakes, reboots, flying saucers, alien invasion films and the sci- fi chops of Jeff Goldblum, William Fichtner and Brent Spiner. Anyone who has ever had a half-empty pizza box sit in their fridge and let it set there for a month; imagine it sitting there for twenty years, taking it out and putting it in the microwave. That's this movie.Independence Day: Resurgence takes place in a parallel universe where the world not only survived the first global invasion of tentacled little green men, but has learned from their technology. David Levinson (Goldblum) the cable guy who took down the last wave with a Pepsi can and the power of computer magic, is now the head of Earth's defenses. You'd think that'd entitle him to an office and a placard but no, when we first meet him he's checking out the crash- zone of one of the saucers in East Africa. Meanwhile on the moon station (That's right we now have army bases on the moon), Will Smith replacement #1 (Hemsworth) and Harry Connick Jr. replacement (Tope) await the arrival of Earth Space Defense superstar Will Smith replacement #2 (Usher) and his crew ahead of the July 4th celebration. The aliens show up, stuff get's exploded, Bill Pullman makes a heartfelt speech.What truly makes Resurgence not just bad but Wing Commander (1999) bad, is there seems to not be a single soul who gives a s*** either on screen or behind the scenes. New cast members all seem to be on autopilot while returning cast members Goldblum, Pullman, Hirsch and Vivica A. Fox all dodder through their scenes with an increasingly panicked sense of obsolescence. Director Roland Emmerich, the undisputed king of city-sized destruction and mayhem, seems to be having trouble hiding contempt for his audience. Every time we think the film is going to go in a new and interesting direction, the script (written by five different writers) wants to insert some nakedly obvious callback that doesn't add to the plot nor feels organic. Everything from the exposition, to the lighthearted moments, to the 24 (2001-2010)-like plot-threads all seem abysmally second rate.And here's the sad part, everything about the first movie was already second rate! But it was the endearing kind of second rate that loosened willing audiences to revel in the brightly-colored chaos and not worry about the time-tested formula that's being regurgitated. Even before the summer of 1996, you could close your eyes and just imagine Robert Loggia, James Rebhorn and Randy Quaid playing those exact roles in other films or even in real life. Likewise the original story was so lean and gleefully formulaic that no one at the time even noticed the aliens had no reason to start a fight. They were a force of nature; something we all had to collectively work together to destroy. Who gave a damn about their motivations.Well Resurgence apparently does. Despite having absolutely no cultural clout for the last twenty years, the producers of this exceptionally terrible movie not only saw fit to give the aliens an unnecessary mythology but bring in a second alien race for good measure. What results is one of those plot points that is simultaneously complicated and needlessly boring; like reading a Blu-Ray manual; or watching The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension (1984) without the welcome sight of John Lithgow.The ONLY reason for this film's existence is to somehow haphazardly cash in on the trend of franchising which has given the studio execs of Disney untold billions and the execs of Warner Bros., Sony, and 20th Century Fox headaches. In my mind I can see Roland Emmerich and company reading the trades, scanning Marvel's profit margins and going, ""That's the one thing we forgot to do!"" Problem is you can't make a franchise out of a once-in-a-generation, cultural touchstone of a movie, whose contribution to cinema is limited to a place and time. Even when you're hedging your bets by casting Angelbaby in a flagrant attempt to appeal to Chinese markets.Take away the cynicism of making a franchise after the fact and ignoring the total lack of Will Smith (yes I had to sneak in his name somewhere), there's no denying this film is a true-blue dud. The special-effects are embarrassingly shoddy, the acting poor all- around and the story is so excruciatingly clunky that I personally was one Independence Day callback away from throwing my drink at the screen. The film is left open-ended in a frenzied sequel-baiting finish so misplaced, it felt like the slowest kid on the track and field team was darting to the coach to see if he made the cut. No son, you didn't. Now go sit on the bench with The Golden Compass (2007) and the Green Lantern (2011) movie.",Independence Day - Resurgence
87,moviexclusive,"Packed with visual spectacle but lacking in everything else, 'IDR' is big, loud and dumb summer entertainment best enjoyed with popcorn, Coke and an uncritical mind",6,24 June 2016,"A good twenty years has passed since Will Smith's F18 pilot Steven Hiller and Jeff Goldblum's computer scientist David Levinson entered the alien mothership that blew up the White House and detonated it from within, saving the human race from annihilation and giving the world two decades of peace through its unity against a more fearsome enemy . In that time, a global Earth Space Defense Agency has been set up with outposts on the moon and Saturn, supported by a defense force that counts Steven's son Tom and former President Bill Thomas J. Whitemore's daughter as its pilots. Alien technology has enriched not just our weaponry but our very lives, allowing us to build a high-tech utopia where we can overcome our human limitations such as gravity.As tantalizing as Roland Emmerich's vision of an alternate present may be, few – we suspect – will be in the mood to get re-acquainted with our heroes of yesteryear, notwithstanding that Emmerich have taken pains to bring them back for this long-overdue sequel. Like before, it is alien destruction on a monumental scale that most will likely be eagerly awaiting with bated breath – including Malaysia's Petronas Twin Towers smashing into the London Eye, Dubai's Burg Kalifa 'spearing' London's Tower Bridge and our very own iconic Marina Bay skyline decimated by the marauding species. Never mind that Emmerich suggests our little red dot is a city in China, seeing our landmarks breaking apart on the big screen as they are sucked up into the sky by a 3000-mile wide queen ship is not a kick you get to have every day.Alas this is hardly the first time that Emmerich has plotted worldwide catastrophe – '2012' and 'The Day After Tomorrow' were also his doings – and that probably explains why he seems less keen on destroying the landmarks than on choreographing the aerial and ground battles between man and alien. Leading the charge against the invaders in Smith's place are Liam Hemsworth's maverick pilot Jake Morrison and Jessie T Usher's Dylan Hiller (the son of Smith's character), the two Top Gun wannabes at odds with each other at the start following a training skirmish that almost killed Dylan. Quite frankly, the personal drama goes nowhere, serving only as filler before the pair take to the skies to try and take down the queen right at the heart of the mothership.But what a thrilling spectacle that makes, as swarms of fighter jets and alien spaceships whiz past each other at dizzying speeds in an aerial dogfight that Emmerich pulls off with aplomb. Emmerich has always loved orchestrating spectacle, and despite a brief sojourn into dramatic fare (last year's 'Stonewall' anyone?), he demonstrates here that he has not lost his knack for epic-scaled action sequences that he was known for creating long before Marvel got into the game. The finale that sees Emmerich bring the fight out to the Salt Flats of Nevada (because the Earth Space Defense Agency just happens to be headquartered in Area 51, get it?) too doesn't disappoint, especially in its show of human wit and ingenuity against the might and numbers of the alien contingent.Yet even as it finds Emmerich at his best, 'IDR' also represents Emmerich at his worst. Character work is middling at best, dismal at worst. Goldblum's wry Earth Space Defense director fares best, given the honour of dishing out the occasional sardonic quip that helps the movie as a whole find the right balance between absurd and awesome. Pullman's PTSD-stricken ex-President seems present only for nostalgia's sake, with little to do than to show that he is just as self-sacrificial with or without that presidential title. Usher is no Will Smith (despite trying to echo the latter by selling the iconic line 'Get ready for a close encounter, bitch!') and barely registers. Ditto ex-President Whitmore's grown-up daughter Patricia (Maika Monroe), who serves no purpose but as love interest to Jake, the only memorable figure of the new guard. Not that fans of the original will be impressed; instead, they are more likely to cheer the return of Brent Spiney and John Storey as a pair of gay lovers/ nuclear scientists at Area 51.Despite the assistance of four other co-writers (including his frequent collaborator Dean Devlin), Emmerich's storytelling leaves much to be desired. After a steady build-up in the first half hour, the rest feels like a patchwork that threatens to fall apart due to under-developed plot threads, vague timelines and Deus-ex-Machinas the size of giant Pokeballs (we mean this literally). Because the invasion and the subsequent response feels rushed and somewhat incoherent, one can't quite feel the anticipation before the attack, the great release of tension when it hits, and that sigh of relief when the threat is finally neutralized. The occasional levity does help to gloss over some of the sheer ludicrousness, but Emmerich's failure to get his audience invested in his narrative or his characters means that you won't feel the fist-pumping emotional triumph he is clearly aiming for at the end.And in a sense, 'IDR' is quintessential Emmerich, built on a promise of epic spectacle which it delivers spectacularly but diminished in storytelling and character. It was always unrealistic to expect this sequel to match up to the expectations of its predecessor, not least because the latter was a cultural touchstone by heralding the arrival of the modern-day effects-driven blockbuster. For millennials though, Emmerich has ensured that this sequel works like a blast from the past, reveling in visual excess and embracing its silly cheesy premise with open arms. How much you love this resurgence depends on your appetite for big, loud and dumb fun that you won't remember once you step out of the cinema, which makes for great summer entertainment – but frankly not much more.",Independence Day - Resurgence
88,denis888,Unintentionally Hilarious !,1,7 February 2017,"Roland Emmerich is a very unstable kind of man, he can do a tremendous film like Day After Tomorrow, or then he can create a terribly poor flick as 2012, or this sequel to Independence Day. This is a typical butch of what can be done wrong to make it even more terrible. All the awful clichés are here, and I will not retell them so that not to reveal plot lines. All I can say is that the whole array of good actors and all the bunch of excellent FX do not save this shambles of a movie from being suddenly funny. Whenever the plot tries to be tragic or serious or deep, it turns out to be hilarious, silly, shallow, trite or even downward stupid. Emmerich is at his worst here, and his attempts of creating a decent Sci-Fi movie all break against the rocks of pathetic failure. You can watch this idiocy for laughs just once and then forget altogether.",Independence Day - Resurgence
89,Terryfan,The sequel nobody wanted or needed,1,6 July 2017,I swear if I had a dollar for everything we got force sequels I would be a millionaire.Independence Day: Resurgence is one of those forced sequels as the studio's excuse to make another franchise. This movie should have never even seen the light of day.It's one thing to want to have a fan story but this movie story is so bad that it makes you want to got to sleep and honestly I was started to fall asleep during this movie so much that I had to get up and do other things.Why make a sequel to a 20 year old motion picture? I mean there was no need whatsoever to make this movie not even to make a extra dollar because clearly this movie didn't get a return on the investment that the studio made this movie.The effects in the movie are simply awful and it goes to show how low a movie can go I have seen video games with better effects than this. The acting in the movie isn't worth talking about because the cast was there just to get a paycheck it is clear to see and it has good actors too but clearly a bad attempt to make the movie work.Honestly don't bother watching this movie it just don't offer you anything new just a bad attempt to make more money off a old film.I give Independence Day: Resurgence an 1 out of 10,Independence Day - Resurgence
90,Screen_Blitz,Bombastic Independence Day sequel riddled with clichés and messy script,4,23 October 2016,"Roland Emmerich blow audiences everywhere away in 1996 when he brought us 'Independence Day', a film that ignited fireworks at the box office the summer of its release. While it wasn't necessarily anything original, it was still loads of fun and left audiences cheering at the spectacular at the action sequences and special effects. Now comes the most important question: did we really need a sequel?. Though Roland Emmerich's alien invasion actioner was nothing short of success, nobody was really itching for a sequel; and when it comes to continuing the story proceeding the epic ""war of 1996"" there is only little Emmerich can do to squeeze the remaining juice of its predecessor. And the result of what Emmerich brings to this sequel delivers fair justification of why the already planned trilogy (apparently) has very little chance being successful, regardless of the massive box office returns. It's utterly disappointing to see a lot of charm and personality of the predecessor to be sucked in such a bombastic sequel, one of the damages here is inflicted by the absence of Will Smith who along with Jeff Goldblum was a major show stealer in the original, but failed to make his return here due to financial deputes. And sadly, this is only the beginning of what plagues this film.Set twenty years after the military successfully defeated the alien fleet that nearly wiped out mankind, the United States has revolutionized in technology with new alien technology integrated in our society including the military. President Whitmore (played by Bill Pullman) has retired as president, but is still haunted by the memories of the disastrous war and fears of their return; and his daughter Patricia (played by Maika Monroe) is now grown up and is engaged to U.S Air Force pilot Jake Morrison (played by Liam Hemsworth) who is stationed on an air force base on the moon. Joining the Air Force is Dylan Miller (played by Jessie Usher), son of Captain Steven Miller (played by Will Smith in the last film) who apparently died during a test flight and the now widowed Jasmine Miller (played by Vivica A. Fox) who now works as a nurse administrator. He and Jake have suffered a strained friendship after Jake pulled a stunt that caused Dylan to crash and nearly killed him. Meanwhile, Dr. David Levinstein (played by Jeff Goldblum) returns aboard the international military spaceship where he and General Joshua Adams (played by William Fichtner) discover that a new alien mother ship has arrived and is set wipe out the human race once again. The Air force must step back in gear and launch an attack against the alien fleet to save the future of mankind.Roland Emmerich isn't well known for quality character development or dialogue in his films nor does he push for any sense of realism, so sitting through this bombastic action piece requires the average viewer to turn his or her brain off to enjoy. The film crams an insane amount of characters and pointless subplots (one involving Judd Hirsch and a group of kids on a school bus) into the story with only a faction of the characters from the first film making their return. The rest of the characters we are introduced to here are sorely generic and lack charisma to make us care for them. With Will Smith out of the picture, he is replaced by Liam Hemsworth who doesn't carry the film the very well nor does his subpar performance. Jesse Usher as the son of Will Smith's Steven Miller isn't very charismatic here either as his character is so one-dimensional, resulting in him falling deep under his father's shadow rather than carrying on his father's legacy, which is quite sad. And it certainly doesn't help that the characters deliver some of the corniest dialogue that likely to evoke more eye-rolls than laughs. Jeff Goldblum who still carries the same charisma from the last film is probably the only saving grace in the character department, and even he barely has the screen time to make up for these overwhelming flaws. The film's highest point though would obviously be the action sequences, featuring loud, noisy action sequences involving CGI-filled explosions and dogfights against the alien spaceship and massive destruction of nearly major landmark. However, it is mostly just more of we saw previously in the first film; nothing new.Independence Day: Resurgence is a bombastic sequel plagued with a clichéd script, flimsy dialogue, lack of charismatic characters, and an overall absence of the original film's appealing personality. With its big budget action sequences and special effects serving as the only redeeming quality along with the charm of Jeff Goldblum, this sequel is a disappointing continuation to the 1996 film that squanders its potential on soulless narrative mediocrity. Not a terrible movie, but not a good one either.",Independence Day - Resurgence
91,Troy_Campbell,Spectacular imagery and action make up (partially) for awful screen writing and acting.,6,23 June 2016,"Arriving twenty years after its predecessor took the world by storm, this belated sequel is relying heavily on nostalgia and curiosity to drive up enthusiasm levels. Which is fine, unless the resulting movie is a stinker. Thankfully ID:R isn't a flop, although it ain't going to light the world on fire either. There are two broad elements that sit at extreme opposite ends on the satisfaction scale with this follow-up. At the super-positive end are the visuals and the action, at the negative end is, well, everything else. Let's get the bad news out of the way first. The script, written by a team of five, is dreadful; the plot is initially semi-interesting but quickly becomes derivative and predictable, the alt-futuristic universe has zero depth, and the dialogue is truly, truly horrible. The cast – a combination of young (Liam Hemsworth, Maika Monroe, Jessie T. Usher) and old (Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman, William Fichtner) – valiantly attempt to swim upstream against the strong current of poor screen writing, but fail. Brent Spiner is particularly awful as a crazy scientist, a role that should've been cut entirely, however Pullman gets the award for single worst scene for his unintentionally laughable pep talk to a handful of unknown mechanics. Enough about that though, let's move on to the good news. Visually this blockbuster is utterly spectacular, the sheer scale and ambition of what director Roland Emmerich is trying to achieve is breathtaking, ultimately succeeding in one-upping the original in both size and sheer awesomeness. Both the various spacecraft and alien-tech-infused infrastructure are conceptually intriguing, whilst the nasty otherworldly creatures themselves (especially the Queen Harvester) are superbly disgusting in design and execution. Action-wise there's an abundance of frenetic set pieces to stir up excitement – despite a few aerial dogfights being near on incomprehensible – with a jaw dropping sequence in which the 3000-mile wide alien mothership enters Earth, entire countries be damned, worth the price of admission on its own. Not the glorious Resurgence this franchise was seeking, yet the striking imagery and grand-scale action ensures a certain level of ear-destroying and retina-blasting gratification.",Independence Day - Resurgence
92,RNMorton,"Nice try, but...",6,25 June 2016,"Well, maybe it wasn't too much of a nice try given how great the first movie in the series was. Let's talk about that one for a second, in my mind the best sci-fi alien movie ever made and just spectacular in so many ways from beginning to end. Also eminently re-watchable. This one has all the special effects but it isn't nearly as tight, driven or as personally involving as the original. Pullman and Goldblum are okay, as are Oparei and Monroe as Pullman's daughter, but Hemsworth did absolute zero for me as well as some of the other main actors. One early tell was the too much hokey backstory to the younger characters. It is a sort of plug-n-play movie of the Transformers ilk, some nice cinematic eye candy but not much natural flow or substance. I can't say I'm too disappointed because the original exceeded the expectations in this genre by so much, just the same I was holding out a little hope that this wouldn't be a sell out. It had it's moment, and (very smartly) had a short running time, but I don't plan on watching it again anytime soon. To be fair, my 11 year old gave it 8 1/2 stars so he liked it better than me.",Independence Day - Resurgence

94,blott2319-1,"About the same as the original, merely OK",6,12 June 2020,"After finally sitting down and watching Independence Day: Resurgence for myself I'm a bit befuddled why it was so reviled. I'll admit that the new young actors are no match for the charisma of Will Smith, and this film could have used a big presence like that in order to liven it up a bit. I also can see that the landmarks that are destroyed in this film are a bit less iconic, considering one of the big selling points of the original was images of the Empire State Building, the White House, and other legendary buildings exploding. However, I think there is a large contingent of people who have fond memories of Independence Day from when they were younger, that have elevated that movie into some kind of legendary status, so this sequel couldn't live up to that standard. What they failed to realize is that the original isn't that good, and this sequel is on par with it in terms of quality. Both of the ID movies are big, loud monster movies with a cast of ridiculous characters trying to work together to survive and save the Earth.Resurgence is an utterly ludicrous movie that takes some of the insanity of the first film and cranks it up to the extreme. I found it kind of funny that, in many ways, they just went bigger with everything so that the aliens would still be a threat even though the humans had some alien weaponry this time. Some of the characters are fun to watch. In particular, it's always enjoyable to see Jeff Goldblum running around. There are some lesser characters that no one cares about, just like in the first film. In this case, Judd Hirsch is almost unwatchable and should have been cut from the story. The CGI is solid, and I think they did a good job making some fully animated aliens so we could see them walking around unlike the first film where they tried to go primarily practical and at times they looked like Muppets. There were some fun moments, and also parts where the movie slowed down and bored me. I didn't love Independence Day: Resurgence, but I thought it was a worthy successor to the equally mediocre original.",Independence Day - Resurgence

96,Benjamin-M-Weilert,An unnecessary film that merely highlights a Hollywood who is trying too hard to cash in on 1990's nostalgia.,5,8 March 2019,"Can we just be real for a second? Is the nostalgia factor so strong in Hollywood these days that anything coming upon its 20th anniversary is re-made, rebooted, and sequeled to death? Certainly, this is a pretty good marketing strategy, since last year's Jurassic World (2015) was such a huge financial success, even though it was essentially the exact same plot as the original Jurassic Park (1993). Clearly, the millennials who grew up with these films want to see them on the big screen again, 20+ years later with newer and flashier special effects. After all, Moore's Law implicates the visual style should be more than 1,000 times better than its predecessor.Here's the problem I have with this re-quel that seems to be going around: it doesn't give us anything new. Take Independence Day (1996) for example. This film was a great action film filled with plenty of interesting sci-fi, memorable characters, and brief moments of tension-lifting comedy. Now, fast forward 20 years and now we have Independence Day: Resurgence (2016). While the same elements were there, it just didn't have the same spark as the original. Sure, it had some of the exact same characters, aged 20 years, and it even had new characters to replace the ones who didn't appear in this sequel. But for some reason, I just didn't care about them. These characters were in a future different from this current time, which merely added to the disconnect.Sure, the film takes the logical next steps after the conclusion of its 1996 original, but everything just felt so . . . forced. What made the original great was its focus on the United States standing up and leading the charge against alien invaders. With the world in the film now united, ""Independence Day"" just doesn't have as much of an impact to the audience as it did when Bill Pullman gave his famous, presidential speech. Sure, they tried it again with another speech, and another plot that almost exactly mirrors the originals, but that's not why I wanted to see this film. I wanted to see what new things could be thought up, but instead I got 20-year-old leftovers. I'm not going to even mention my complete and utter ire at the clear call out for a sequel to this film. This does not need to be a trilogy, but now it has completely and fully fallen into the Trilogy Conundrum.An unnecessary film that merely highlights a Hollywood who is trying too hard to cash in on 1990's nostalgia, I give Independence Day: Resurgence 2.5 stars out of 5.",Independence Day - Resurgence
97,RforFilm,"The action in Independence Day: Resurgence is just as fun, though the story may have come a little too late",6,27 June 2016,"The 90's were all about aliens. The X-Files, Mars Attacks, Men in Black, the Tim Burton Planet of the Apes, Space Jam, Galaxy Quest, Starship Troopers, and even Muppets in Space were all a part of the craze that was of extraterrestrial phenomenon that people all were a part of. All of this has to do with a 1996 movie called Independence Day. This wasn't just a blockbuster; it was a game changer. It was either the third or fourth movie to take advantage of the new tool of computer special effects. Jurassic Park may have had dinosaurs, but Independence Day showed an alien invasion like no other before. In the third grade, this movie was everywhere on posters, lunchboxes, toys, and simply of the word of mouth from every kid that phrased it for how cool it was. It was like an Irwin Allen film that managed to get a lot of big names like Bill Pullman, Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, and many more. Looking back at it now, the story made little sense and the writing was campy and corny, but it's action was impressive and it's dumb action was fun. Twenty years later, the aliens have returned in Independence Day: Resurgence. Since the events of the first movie, mankind has used the alien technology to change the way they live. They live in a utopia where space travel is more frequent with a moon military base, that includes Jake Morrison (played by Liam Hemsworth) and son of Will Smith's character Dylan (played by Jessie Usher) who are the top pilots. This is run by the UN created Earth Space Defense, being directed by David Levinson (played by Jeff Goldblum) who is in Africa looking at the only ship from 1996 that landed. He doesn't see much of his father Julies (played by Judd Hirsch), but that may change when the military starts seeing new signals.Not only had Dr. Okun (played by Brent Spiner) has woken up from a twenty year coma seeing new visions, but former president Thomas Whitmore (played by Bill Pullman) is having those same dreams. It seems that another ship has arrived, but it's bigger then the fifteen mile ships from the last movie. In fact, in a spectacular sequence of special effects, the new ship that comes covers the entirety of the Atlantic Ocean. Once again, the world has to join forces in order to prevent the aliens from destroying the planet. With all the time we've waited for a sequel, does Independence Day: Resurgence live up to the hype? In my eyes, yes, but for most that loved the original, probably not. I'll admit that part of me misses Will Smith who asked for too much money. The good news is that returning people like Jeff Goldblum and Bill Pullman keep things alright. Some of the newer cast members like Liam Hemsworth and Jessie Usher do alright. It's just that some character arcs like Judd Hirsch and Maika Monroe aren't as interesting and even seem to exist only to extend the story.What about the action scenes. It's clear that it's all CGI, but director Roland Emmerich knows how to use it to the advantage of action. Unlike 2012 where it felt monotonous, here it's better paced and even exciting. As I said, the alien ship landing is the generations ""White House being blown up by aliens"" scene. The writing is still campy and corny, so whether you'll like it or not depends on your opinion of the original. I'll admit that the worst part of the movie is the ending in which I wont give away, but it tries so hard to set up a sequel it was painful.I'll give this six alien ships out of ten. I personally got what I wanted which was a dumb, but fun summer alien movie, but is certainly not as memorable as the original. Those that have waited years for the continuing story may find themselves feeling empty. Give your opinion a thought from the old movie, and see if Independence Day: Resurgence is your cup of tea.",Independence Day - Resurgence

More likely he read the script and his salary was going to CGI.It must be too long as it drags early. There is bad dialogue like ""meet me after the briefing"".

99,fernandoschiavi,"Ressurgence is visually spetacular, but this sequence continues the fight between humans and aliens in a lazy way, without inspiration or great moments",5,10 April 2021,"Roland Emmerich's newest film carries with it countless influences from the catharsis and exaggeration of the cinema of the 1990s. Without fear of being tacky, Roland Emmerich's film detaches itself from any didacticism and entrusts the spectator with the task of entertaining himself with the absurd. The alien invasion has the air of a frantic game nowadays, full of top quality effects that are only concerned with enchanting and entertaining during the almost two hours of duration.Emmerich has no interest in debating or even raising political issues. In fact, everything appears free of charge, creating a fragile basis for a new confrontation between humans and aliens. Therefore, the formula found is to mix heroes from the previous battle with a new generation, endowed with the necessary vigor for yet another conflict. Only, if the old ones sound like a mere repetition of the original, the newbies do not demonstrate the charisma necessary to take the reins as protagonists. In other words, the film fails at the two ends that should serve as a foundation.Hiller is the son of Will Smith's character in the first film. In the story, he passed away in the first test of a spaceship that mixes human technology with alien and is treated like an idol by the population. Dylan is not the only one who continues with his father's legacy. Maika Monroe plays Patricia Whitmore, daughter of ex-President Whitmore, Bill Pullman's character who returns with a lot of importance in the plot. The same goes for David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), Julius Levinson (Judd Hirsch) and Dr. Okun (Brent Spiner) - the old guard of the first feature. And all of them, new and old, intersect in the second wave of attacks by the aliens shown in The Resurgence. Bringing back the characters in the first film, works for nostalgia, but all the roles played by them are laughable; with only Goldblum being really essential. Seeing Pullman embodying a crazy version of former President Thomas Whitmore elicits significant laughter, once becoming too stupid. And even if we are talking about aliens and galactic invasions, the solution to bring Dr. Okun back is simply unfortunate. Finally, I think we can all agree that seeing Hirsch played in a subplot with random children on a school bus is completely expendable.History and script should definitely not be a concern here. The absurdly bloated script of names like Nicolas Wright, James A. Woods, Dean Devlin, James Vanderbilt and Roland Emmerich himself is an endless mess, with pierced plans and a thematic repetition that borders on the absurd at different times. The entire plan of the Terrans to defeat the aliens revolves around yet another stolen device, again, and now we have a mysterious symbol that acts as the main MacGuffin of the first act, only to later discover that it is something very sudden. And it is laughable to see that the aliens establish a kind of mental connection with some of the characters.The script seeks to infantile the adventure at all times, whether through rough dialogues or caricatures involving minorities. There is also a repetition of situations from the original film, such as the insistence around President Whitmore's famous speech and the attempt to replicate it, without success (although it has a great reference to ""Contact"" involving the original speech) and a handful of questions without logical answers about the direction of the battle, involving a virtual being who has an essential participation in the conflict. Apart from the various emotional triggers with children and dogs, which appear here and there in order to bring a supposed drama to the battle at the moment.And this excess of writers highlight one of the main problems of this continuation, which is its absolute lack of identity coupled with a montage without any structure, which makes the film seem much longer than it really is, with jokes that don't work, and cores without any importance. The first film tastefully embodied the spirit of the 1960s B-movies fueled by a first-rate budget, as well as having a Will Smith at the height of his comic timing and improvisational skills (basically the entire anthological scene of Smith carrying a alien through the desert was improvised). This ""Independence Day - The Resurgence"", on the other hand, does not know exactly what it wants to be. His greatest success is to show how much 2016 of his narrative differs from the one in which we live and to show - even in an inconstant way - how the daily life of that world changed due to the 1996 war. At the same time, the film ""reference"" (aham) shamelessly productions like ""Aliens - The Rescue"", ""Godzilla"", ""Macross"" and ""Star Patrol"", never finding a voice of their own, looking more like a Frankenstein monster from sci-fi franchises - even the soundtrack, in a few moments, it seems taken from ""Star Wars"".In addition to the alien invasion, Emmerich, Devlin and company clog the projection with ill-fitting plots, such as the poorly established rivalry between pilots Jake (Liam Hemsworth) and Dylan (Jessie T. Usher), the latter son of Will Smith's character, who passed away between the two films. In addition, we have the ""madness"" of two characters from the original, former US President Thomas Whitmore (Bill Pullman) and scientist Dr. Okun (Brent Spiner), the romance between Jake and Patty Whitmore (Maika Monroe), the disastrous decisions by the current president (Sela Ward), the research by David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) and his colleague Catherine (Charlotte Gainsbourg), the appearance of an African military chief (Deobia Oparei) and several Chinese characters, the meaningless appearances some from Vivica A. Fox and Judd Hirsch in the course of the projection.Visual exaggerations and Emmerich's sense of space and camera movement are the greatest asset of The Resurgence. As in the first film, when the German managed to give the exact scale of the disasters, he did not forget to transmit the grandeur of the destruction on screen. Humans are always placed alongside alien spaceships and the sights serve as a reference for the size of the impact. The good news of this sequence is the ability to work on spatial effects in completely different and unprecedented situations, when compared to Emmerich's previous works. The Star Wars of the second act and the final battle are examples of how a good edition manages to place the spectator well in a fight that takes place, at least, in two places at the same time. And in both situations, Independence Day diversifies the tone of the action. In one he brings a spatial shooting full of colors and agility in the camera, while in the other he shows a monstrous and slow fight, without losing the impact that the climax of a blockbuster like this needs to have.However, what really surprises is the low relevance of the action scenes, their usual specialty. The mystery surrounding the ships in the original film has been completely abandoned, and the attack itself is nothing more than a handful of buildings and objects flying aimlessly in order to cause as much destruction as possible. No emblematic scenes, like the destruction of the White House from the previous film. Interestingly, the most interesting action scene is set in an inhospitable desert, where the main alien antagonist wins a battle at the height; with a clear inspiration in the life cycle of the creatures of 'Aliens, The Rescue'. In the final scenes it is funny to think that a giant alien responsible for the extermination of populations on other planets ends up being distracted by a yellow bus full of children. In addition, the ease with which the antagonist is defeated is super uncomfortable.At the end of the projection, it is not difficult to guess why the film did not do well at the box office and stoned by critics. While the first film featured a tightly knit plot filled with clever plot twists (like the way humans took to destroy the mother ship's shield), the sequence abuses the improbable and the impossible. The truncated plot brings about twenty different central characters, and tries to highlight each of them, failing miserably. After a promising first act, the film is lost in several parallel and unnecessary plots, giving the impression that the script written in five hands was a collection of short stories sewn by an amateur screenwriter. The jokes don't work as they should, and the dramatic scenes elicit involuntary laughter from the audience. The aliens, who in the first film were hidden and shadowy figures, here take physical form and set out to fight, totally destroying the grace and suspense surrounding intergalactic beings.The Resurgence does not hide, at any time, that it just wants to be an escape, a moment of fun that includes a dispute between aliens and humans. Their characters and attitudes remain silly and a good part of the dialogues (or speeches) are as cheesy as the first film - and none of that bothers to the point of disturbing the experience, as there is no suggestion of discussion or depth in the story here. This sequence continues the fight between humans and aliens in a lazy way, without inspiration or great moments. If Jeff Goldblum and Bill Pullman reappear as echoes of their importance in the past, the rookie trio formed by Liam Hemsworth, Jessie Usher and Maika Monroe sounds like a mere caricature, without any emotional depth. In addition to the banal action scenes and the clumsy script, the result is a legitimate B movie, in the worst sense of the term.",Independence Day - Resurgence

101,dave-mcclain,Very independent from the original film - but not in a good way.,3,27 June 2016,"As difficult as it for filmmakers to catch lightning in a bottle, it's much more difficult to do it a second time. The 1996 sci-fi action-adventure ""Independence Day"" made that proverbial bottle flash and glow for Movie Fans worldwide. It put its own spin on the tried-and-true alien invasion plot device, with an exciting and quotable script, great special effects and, maybe most important of all, interesting and diverse characters. The original ""Independence Day"" accumulated box office receipts that were over 10 times its $75,000,000 budget, making it the highest-grossing film of 1996 (and the second biggest ever, up to that time), becoming one of the favorite films of millions around the world. So, is the sequel, ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" (PG-13, 2:00) to put another light show in that bottle? Roland Emmerich is back as director and, along with Dean Devlin, as co-writer (with the addition of three new co-writers), but is the magic?Picking up exactly 20 years after the original story ended (the same as in real life), ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" finds our favorite blue planet better off than ever before. Cities and monuments have been rebuilt, the world's nations have learned to shelve their relatively petty differences and mankind has benefited from exploiting the technology that the alien invaders had brought to earth for ""The War of 1996"". That technology and that international unity have enabled earth to build up its defenses. Area 51 is now the headquarters of the Earth Space Defense (ESD) global defense program, which also operates a defensive base on the moon and has an early warning station on another moon – just off the coast of Saturn. Unfortunately for earth, all this preparation won't be enough. Those doomed unnamed aliens got off a distress call before they were brought low 20 years earlier, and reinforcements are on the way.The 2016 cast of characters is a mixture of new characters and some from the first film, with a few from the original story missing from the sequel, either because they weren't deemed important enough to bother with this time around or because the actors who portrayed them weren't considered attractive enough as adults or asked for too much money to return (ahem, Will Smith). Returnees include brilliant scientist David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), who is now in charge of research at Area 51, and his father, Julius (Judd Hirsch), who has written a book entitled ""How I Saved the World"". David has replaced Dr. Brakish Okun (Brent Spiner), who apparently was not sincerely dead after his vocal chords were manipulated by aliens in '96, and has been in a coma ever since. (I met Brent Spiner at a Comic Con and he told me that getting strangled by alien tentacles doesn't necessarily kill you. Isn't THAT convenient?) Bill Pullman is back as James Whitmore (he of the inspirational pre-climactic battle speech on July 4, 1996, and now a former President who walks with a cane and doesn't always think clearly). He is cared for by his grown daughter, Patricia (now played by Maika Monroe), a former fighter pilot herself, who now works for President Elizabeth Lanford (Sela Ward). Patricia is engaged to current pilot, Jake Morrison (Liam Hemsworth), who works for Jiang Lao (Ng Chin Han) and is stationed on the moon with his best friend, Charlie Miller (Travis Tope), who becomes infatuated with fellow pilot, Rain Lao (Angelababy), who is Jiang Lao's niece. Jake is also involved in an ongoing feud with Dylan Hubrow-Hiller (now played by Jessie Usher), whose adopted father, Steven, apparently died while working as a test pilot and whose mother, Jasmine (Vivica A. Fox), became a nurse and is now a hospital administrator.Okay. Now that we've been through the program, let's get to the story. David is in Africa, where he runs into an old flame named Dr. Katherine Marceaux (French actress Charlotte Gainsbourg). Both of them are investigating strange electrical activity aboard the only ship to land on earth during the late alien war. This brings them into contact with warlord Dikembe Umbutu (Deobia Oparei) who led some bad mammer jammers who fought and ultimately killed the aliens from that one intact ship. When a mother ship that is ""definitely bigger than the first one"" is tracked approaching earth, Levinson, Marceaux and Umbutu go to the moon to see what's happening. Meanwhile, all those who had physical contact with the aliens of '96 are under great physical and mental distress, see visions and mysteriously write out indecipherable alien symbols. As in the original film, all these disparate characters have to bridge generation gaps and cultural divides to figure out what's going on and try to save the planet again.""Independence Day: Resurgence"" is bigger than the original, but definitely not better. Of course, the visuals are better, but they don't seem 20 years' worth of better. None of the characters (old or new) are as fun or interesting as in the first film. Between not clearly updating some stories and the way it so easily disposes of others, this script doesn't respect its characters – or its audience. Some of the situations contradict plot points from the first film and some just don't make much sense in any context. If the first film was a roller coaster, with all sorts of enjoyable ups and downs, loops, twists and turns, the second film is a single slog up a tall mountain, where the view doesn't end up being as interesting as you had imagined (or as the ""brochure"" led you to believe). The story isn't as much ""Independence Day"" as it is ""Star Wars"" or ""Starship Troopers"" and its ending sets up another sequel that seems destined to be like the latter. ""Independence Day: Recycled"" might have been a more accurate title for this semi-entertaining, but uninspired sequel. No lighting in this bottle. Fireflies at best.

102,Vivekmaru45,I think the critics have been too harsh on this film.,7,22 November 2016,"This is the direct sequel to the 1996 film Independence Day and stars an ensemble cast featuring Liam Hemsworth, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman, Jessie Usher, Maika Monroe, Travis Tope, William Fichtner, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Judd Hirsch, Brent Spiner and Sela Ward.The film is set twenty years after the events of the first film. Since then, the United Nations have collaborated on the Earth Space Defense (ESD), an international military defense and research organization, and developed hybrid technology reverse-engineered from the invaders' in anticipation that they would return. Unexpectedly, the returning aliens again attack Earth with an advanced and unprecedented force during the twentieth anniversary of humanity's victory against them on July 4.The special effects are better than the first film - we also have more alien technology. Jeff Goldblum(The Fly 1986) and Bill Pullman(Lake Placid 1999) reprise their respective roles. Veteran actor Brent Spiner adds spark to the film. Spiner is a cult figure among fans of Star Trek because he played the role of the android: Data. The newer actors Liam Hemsworth, Jessie Usher and Maika Monroe support the older actors quite well.Roland Emmerich needs no introduction. He has directed such blockbuster films like Universal Soldier 1992 and Stargate 1994. He has directed the film professionally. The background music is well handled by Thomas Wander and Harald Kloser. Beautiful Cinematography by Markus Förderer. My eyes never left the screen from start to finish, a good film.More alien invasion films: Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978), The Thing (1982), Lifeforce (1985), Invaders from Mars (1986), The Live (1988), Killer Klowns From Outerspace(1988), The Puppet Masters (1994), Mars Attacks!(1996), The Arrival (1996).You can add these movies to your collection.

This's the first time I ever went to a movie theater and had to turn on my phone because I was so bored. The acting's stiff and the story drags on as the movie progresses. Honestly this movie didn't need to be made. Instead of improving the story and characters it gives us the same thing basically. Jessie Usher though and Liam Hemsworth are fine and the action and effects are cool which's why I gave it 2 stars but that's about it.

104,swilliky,Terrible sequel that special effects can't save,3,26 June 2016,"I had significantly lowered my expectations for this science fiction, alien invasion sequel after the bad reviews and poor opening weekend box office but had not lowered them enough. Independence Day: Resurgence is terrible. A quick and easy money grab by Hollywood trying to ride the wave of 90s nostalgia. Scenes that were terrifying and spell-binding in the original came off as shallow and uninspired. Even with the advancement of special effects and some cool aliens, the story and characters were rushed and failed to connect.Several of the cast members returned including Jeff Goldblum, Vivica A. Fox, Bill Pullman, Brent Spiner, and Judd Hirsch, the most prominent actor Will Smith notably did not decide to participate in this fiasco. A new set of actors also showed up as the children of characters from the first like Jessi T. Usher, Maika Monroe, and new characters played by Liam Hemsworth, Angela Yeung Wing, Nicolas Wright, and Travis Tope.

105,bellino-angelo2014,"If you liked INDEPENDENCE DAY, you may think twice before watching INDEPENDENCE DAY: RESURGENCE",4,23 December 2019,"While the original INDIPENDENCE DAY wasn't a masterpiece, it was well made and entertaining in its own way. Almost all of the actors looked like they were having a good time and Roland Emmerich's direction was slick and stylish. Unfortunately, its sequel, INDIPENDENCE DAY RESURGENCE, hasn't got the same magic or entertainingness of its predecessor.For 20 years Earth hasn't been threatened by alien creatures. Suddenly new alien species are discovered and most of the humans (some characters from the predecessor and some new ones) battle the new menace with all their resources. This is basically the plot.The cast is uninspired to say the least. Liam Hemsworth gives a really bad performance, as he is wooden and looks uninspired throughout the whole movie. Jessie Usher as Stephen Hiller's son is very broad for most of the time. All the cast members of the predecessor (Jeff Goldblum, Judd Hirsch, Bill Pullman, Vivica A. Fox and even Robert Loggia in one of his final movie roles) try the best with the material they are given and I have to admit it, if it wasn't for them, the movie would have been very unwatchable. Unlike its predecessor, this time the movie is more special effects and loudness that plot (although recently Roland Emmerich has improved himself with MIDWAY). Only the special effects are good but they are too many and too much for most of the movie.Overall, I wouldn't put it among the worst sequels ever made but it's close despite this time it's saved by the cast members of the predecessor. In substance, it had potential but thanks to hackneyed direction, special effects galore and bad acting, it's a mess when compared to the first one.",Independence Day - Resurgence
106,bob-the-movie-man,"Why Will Smith is a wise, wise man",2,22 December 2016,"Roland Emmerich has a lot to answer for with this one. Twenty years after Independence Day smashed the summer box office of 1996, the aliens are back: bigger and badder than ever. Steven Hiller (Will Smith) is no longer on the scene but, to give Emmerich a little credit, he has gathered an impressive array of the original stars to return led by Hiller's wife Jasmine (Vivica Fox), President Whitmore (Bill Pullman), Dr Okun (Brent Spiner), David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) and his dad (Judd Hirsch). The great Robert Loggia even turns up, who played the original General Grey, looking like he is about to expire (which unfortunately he did late last year, and the film is in memorial to him). All of them have weathered over the years apart from Judd Hirsch who must have a picture in his attic.Playing the new generation (Hiller's young son Dylan and the president's daughter Patricia) are Jessie Usher and the comely Maika Monroe respectively, the latter having the pout of a young Jessica Alba and showing promise. Rounding off the young 'uns, and playing an enormously irritating hunk/hero and his sidekick buddy are Jake (Liam Hemsworth – yes, younger brother of Chris) and Floyd (Nicolas Wright). And with the obvious needs of summer blockbusters to appeal to the ravenous Chinese market there is also Shanghai-born Angelababy as a young hotshot pilot and Chin Han as her uncle, moonbase commander Commander Jiang.It's hard to know where to start with criticism of this film. It's like you've caught someone desecrating the grave of a dearly departed relative. The plot is ludicrous. I thought the Oscar for the dumbest aliens of the year was a shoe-in for the ones who chose a similar tactic in ""The 5th Wave"" – but no we have another contender for the crown. The ridiculous London-based CGI sequence – a virtual re-shoot of the ridiculous CGI sequence in Emmerich's ""2012"" where John Cusack is fleeing by plane a collapsing Los Angeles – is mitigated only by Goldblum's witty comment about them ""Always going for the landmarks"" – the best line in the film. Elsewhere, the story and screenplay – by an army of writers (never a good sign) – is risible and an insult to intelligence, alien or otherwise. The ludicrous plot points go on and on Why on earth is the single landed alien craft from 1996 owned by an African warlord? If mankind have 'benefited' so much from the alien technology that must surely have been through the UN-dismantling of that ship? - There seems to be no logical connection between the ""visions"" (stolen from ""Close Encounters"") and the alien craft. The visions might have well have been of the alien's last shopping list (""six cans of Kraag beans; one bottle of Vollufi ale;  ""); - The alien craft is big enough to span the WHOLE Atlantic when it lands, but – who would believe it? – comes to a stop with its edge in Washington JUST ENOUGH to dip the White House flag to a jaunty angle. #cringe; The alien ship – apparently open to the elements – allows our heroic hunks to wander around without spacesuits; - At one point it looked like our curvaceous heroine was going to defeat the alien queen in good ol' Wild West fashion armed only with a handgun (but no, my head could come out of my hands again); - And don't even get me started on the opening ""excitement"" about propping up a collapsing supergun on the moon with a spaceship. Gerry Anderson would be spinning in his grave.The dialogue is little better. The original ""Independence Day"" was probably most famous for two scenes: the impressive destruction of the White House and Bill Paxton's ludicrously corny ""We will not go quietly into the night"" speech. Here trying to go one better we have not just one version of this but two with William Fichner's General Adams chipping one in from the rough before Paxton delivers an impromptu hanger speech that is toe-curlingly excruciating. Much of the acting is of the ""I really don't want to be here but it's good for the pension"" variety with Paxton and Goldblum going through the motions and Charlotte Gainsborough being horribly miscast as a French anthropologist running around the world on the trail of Pokemon Go characters or symbols or something. Only Brent Spiner and Judd Hirsch really get into their stride with likeably over-the-top performances. If this was a standalone story it might scrape a 4* but as it so horrendously sullies a classic movie experience it incurs my cinematic wrath. It might have made Roland Emmer-richer (sic). but my recommendation would be to get a big bag of popcorn, the original 1996 movie on DVD and enjoy. Avoid, avoid, avoid.(For the extended and graphical version of this review please visit bob- the-movie-man.com. Thanks.).",Independence Day - Resurgence

108,timdalton007,"Rolland, Dean: You Had 20 Years To Prepare...",3,3 July 2016,"Twenty years ago, the summer blockbuster movie season was changed forever. Independence Day's tale of human perseverance in the face of an overwhelming alien invasion became one of the highest grossing films of the 1990s thanks to a combination of memorable characters and iconic special effect sequences. It was also a film that felt quite standalone with a definite beginning, middle and end to it. Yet Rolland Emmerich and Dean Devlin (who scripted it as well as respectively directing and producing it) came back for more. Moving forward two decades in time, the film promised to build on the first by showing a rebuilt world taking on the threat of renewed invasion. Needless to say, expectations were high. Did it live up to them?The short answer: not at all.Independence Day: Resurgence often feels like it's simply re- treading over old ground, only on a much bigger scale. Many of the iconic moments of the first film are done here from shots of the lunar surface, aerial battles, infiltrating an alien space ship, the destruction of landmarks and much more. Even the film's big threat is really just a much larger version of the ships from the first film (this time an even more improbable 3,000 miles in diameter). Or take the ending when combines the ending of the original film with the duo's first project post ID4. Though the film finds the occasions where it subverts those moments (such as with the original film's most iconic scene), Emmerich and Devlin don't seem to have brought much new to the table here.What they bring instead is the attitude that ""bigger is better"". From the rebuilt cities we glimpse in the opening moments to the over-sized alien ship, all the film can seem to do is take what came before and give it to us again on a larger scale. Yet despite the two decades that have passed and all the apparent advances in special effects, those featured here are less impressive and less convincing than their 1996 counterparts. Whereas the first film relied on the physical as well as CGI, this film seems to make almost extensive use of CGI throughout including with the aliens themselves. Gone is the sense of reality and physicality that made the first film's effects so effective, replaced by a kind of CGI blandness that could make this film fit in with any other number of would-be disaster epics that came in the wake of the original film. It's as if Emmerich and Devlin forgot what made their earlier work so memorable.That extends to much of the rest of the film as well. Whereas the original film was populated by memorable characters with witty dialogue, this film lacks that completely. We're given a handful of characters from the original film twenty years on, primarily in the form of Jeff Goldblum's David Levinson as well as Bill Pullman's former President Whitmore and Brent Spiner as Doctor Okun, plus cameos from others who really don't add much of anything to the film (most especially Vivica A. Fox) though none of them feel like their anything but caricatures of their original selves. The new cast of characters are scarcely memorable from the recast roles of Dylan Hill and Patricia Whitmore (played by Jessie Usher and Maika Monroe) to Liam Hemsworth's pilot Jake to Sela Ward's President Lanford and William Fichtner's General Adams, all of whom are written so bland that no actor in the world could have found a way to make them more memorable. Like Emmerich's White House Down three years ago, he managed to put an impressive cast into an otherwise unmemorable film.Indeed, the word ""unmemorable"" describes the end result of Independence Day: Resurgence. Despite its pedigree, the return of both the original filmmakers and some members of its original cast, not to mention twenty years of advances in special effects technology the end result is a film that isn't half as good or half as memorable as the original. Instead it's a bland piece of work, filled with what should be eye-catching special effects that instead remind of us of just how much better the original film was.All of which leads me to ask a question. Rolland, Dean: you had twenty years to prepare. Was this really the best you could come up with?",Independence Day - Resurgence
109,griffolyon12,An OK Sequel,7,25 June 2016,"It has been 20 years since the first Independence Day hit theaters and now we have a sequel, Independence Day: Resurgence. Pretty much every major character is back (sans Will Smith), with Jeff Goldblum and Bill Pullman reprising their iconic roles from the first movie. In story time, it too has been 20 years, with humanity having united to repurpose the alien technology left behind to improve our own weapons in preparation. In preparation for what, you might ask? The aliens inevitable return, of course.All in all, Independence Day: Resurgence is a fun movie, but it pales in comparison to its predecessor, which has taken on a massive level of iconography for children of the Nineties. While there are tons of explosions and one-liners, there seems to be something missing. That something is the indescribable x-factor that movies like this often have that transforms them into cultural touchstones. Now none of this is to say that Resurgence is a bad movie or a poor sequel, the filmmakers simply failed to catch lightning in a bottle again. That is a very hard thing to do, and it only makes you more appreciate the movie franchises that have been able to do it multiple times. Now with all that out of the way, here is where Resurgence really shines, with the new cast of young characters.Liam Hemsworth leads a talented cast of 20-somethings -- including Maika Monroe and Jesse Usher, as Bill Pullman's daughter and Will Smith's stepson -- that steal the show. These new characters are a mixture of orphans and children of the heroes from the first Independence Day who have the kind of resolve reminiscent of young men and women from the Greatest Generation. It is in the scenes with these new characters that I actually found myself most engaged with the movie, which I did not think would happen going in. However, this does not mean that the returning cast of Goldblum, Pullman, and the rest don't have good standout moments (with welcome returns from Judd Hirsch and Brent Spiner as well), but the filmmakers do a nice job of creating new heroes for a potential sequel. Another area in which the movie succeeds is in the area of visual effects.The first Independence Day had amazing visual effects, but the two decades since have really unshackled the filmmakers to let their imaginations run wild. Things that would have been too expensive to do 20 years ago, can now be done. While that could have easily been a negative, it actually works as a positive because director Roland Emmerich shows enough restraint to never make the visual effects look like visual effects. As well, the better visual effects allow the filmmakers to show us more of the aliens this time about. In the original movie, the aliens were only ever seen in fleeting glimpses or from the waist up. In this one there are multiple full body shots of the aliens, which helps to sell the reality of them better.At the end of the day, if you were a fan of Independence Day, you will probably enjoy this more cartoonish sequel, but I use the word cartoonish in the best possible way. The first movie had a more realistic tone, whereas this movie reminds me a lot of Japanese animated TV shows I watched growing up in the Nineties and early Aughts. There seems to be an understanding this go around that it's all fake and meant to just be fun, and while that drains the movie of some of its intensity, it does cause you to childishly grin for most of the runtime.I give Independence Day: Resurgence a 7 out of 10!",Independence Day - Resurgence
110,MrDHWong,"A dull, badly-paced bore with poorly executed clever ideas",5,23 June 2016,"Independence Day: Resurgence is the sequel to the 1996 blockbuster Independence Day. The original movie was a dumb, cheesy action film with great special effects for the time. Despite its shortcomings, it was a guilty pleasure to me. However, the same cannot be said about the sequel. It is a dull, badly-paced bore with poorly executed clever ideas.Twenty years after the events of the original film, human beings have salvaged the technology of the downed alien spacecraft and have used it to live in peace with each other. However, just before their defeat, the aliens were able to send a distress call to the rest of their fleet in outer space. After receiving the call, the aliens send out an ever larger and more powerful fleet towards Earth to once again threaten the existence of humanity.While the original film at least had some admirable practical effects and fun moments, this film was overloaded with bland CGI and surprisingly boring scenes that went nowhere. I felt no emotional attachment to any of the characters, who just felt like one- dimensional cardboard cutouts. Although, I did enjoy some of the ideas that the film employed about humanity adopting the alien technology as their own, this was just briefly glanced over and barely referenced throughout the plot. Overall, I can only really recommend this film to hardcore fans of the original, but even that is pushing it. I rate it a mediocre 5/10.",Independence Day - Resurgence
111,Rickting,A mediocre sequel to a 90s blockbuster classic,5,26 June 2016,"Independence Day wasn't a masterpiece, sure. It's too long and has some massive plot holes, but it's a charismatic and entertaining blockbuster with the right balance of tension and humour. This follow-up, set 20 years later, sees the aliens return with upgraded technology. Much of the time, this is virtually the same movie as the first one, but there are key differences. There's a lot of nostalgia-baiting, which occasionally feels forced and there's far less charisma and suspense this time around. It's basically loads of explosions, characters and elements, some woefully overdone and some woefully underdone, splattering onto a screen with Roland Emmerich, who is a terrible filmmaker even if few seem to acknowledge it, seeing how much he can blow up. Strangely, the White House doesn't get destroyed this time. There are loads of fun moments, Jeff Goldblum steals the show alongside Bill Pullman and it is eventually a suspenseful, thrilling blockbuster but it's dragged down by bad performances from its younger cast members (Even Maika Monroe who was very good in It Follows), weak dialogue and too many different elements colliding together at once. All in all, an entertaining enough sequel, but watch the original instead. 5/10",Independence Day - Resurgence

113,davidgee,President Pullman saves the day - and the movie,7,15 July 2016,"Twenty years after their first invasion the alien hordes are back with a bigger-than-ever flying saucer and their Queen-of-Mean female who's like a dinosaur with tentacles. The USA has a female president (Sela Ward, not Hillary Clinton), and instead of Will Smith we get his son (his character's son) as sidekick to star hunk Liam Hemsworth. But in the end it's ex-President Bill Pullman and ageing science-geek Jeff Goldblum who save the day – and the movie - with the help of a handy talking sphere from another distant galaxy.The ending hints at another sequel – and thus INDEPENDENCE DAY becomes a franchise, like PREDATOR and STARSHIP TROOPERS, to both of which this movie owes some of its imagery and inspiration. The pace is terrific, but the story is – inevitably, perhaps – very much a rehash of 1996 and the characters play second fiddle to the special effects. The CGI is state-of-the-art and then some. As with the second ALIEN and TERMINATOR films, originality cannot be refreshed and overkill replaces any faint element of subtlety and creeping terror. But, as with those two (and quite a few others), there's a lot to enjoy here. Decade after decade, STAR WARS and STAR TREK keep packing the punters in, and so can INDEPENDENCE DAY.",Independence Day - Resurgence

Rarely have I seen so may clichés in the first 30 minutes of a film. It is an insult to the intelligence of the viewer. Some of the actors (the new additions) have never been anywhere near an acting class, I am sure. Bits of it look quite good and the CGI is not awful. But it is proving impossible to care about what happens to the characters or even Earth itself. Roland Emmerich should be ashamed to have directed garbage like this.

117,PyroSikTh,I Almost Fell Asleep,4,28 June 2016,"It's 2016, and apparently what audience's really wanted from an Independence Day sequel was to return to the 90s, because that's what watching this movie feels like. Yet I don't feel it would have done any better back then. The corniness of the original movie was a byproduct of it's time, so it's forgivable. Cheesy one-liners, and rekindled romances that don't really come out of anywhere; on which note, those romantic interests are also the ones completely left behind in the final action sequence.I'm just going to cut to the chase about why I didn't like this movie. I'm obviously not the biggest fan of the original movie. It's enjoyable, but I can live without it. What was great was it's sense of apocalyptic doom, and the wanton destruction left in the aliens' wake. Resurgence lacks that almost entirely. All those scenes of destruction in the trailer are crammed into about five minutes and then largely forgotten about. At least the first movie has some debate on and awareness of the sheer loss of life. Even if characters aren't built up enough for us to get attached, we sort of feel for the deaths from the reactions of other characters. Resurgence cuts that out as well. The most we get is a single tear from a loved one during the daring kamikaze run reminiscent of Randy Quaid's noble sacrifice.Resurgence isn't a complete failure. I can't fault it entirely, because there are a handful of good ideas here. I was reasonably captivated during the movie's early moments because the passage of time was shown quite well. It's been twenty years, and the state of the world has moved along to a technologically prosperous world peace (barring that one African warlord who had to take on the aliens by himself). Levinson is now a major player in the UN, Whitmore is now ex-president who suffers from his mental invasion by the captive alien first time around, little Patricia Whitmore and Dylan Hiller are now all grown up with interlocking histories from inside the Air Force, Jasmine is somehow a senior medical consultant at a city hospital (from stripper to boss of a hospital department in twenty years, impressive), and it turns out Dr. Okun wasn't actually dead, but had been in a coma the whole time. Oh and by the way, he's gay.What really grabbed me about the passage of time was this new sci-fi world of Fusion Drives, massive laser cannons on the moon, and giant television screens the size of the White House used for formal addresses about easy victories over aliens that may or may not have been friendly. Resurgence definitely felt more like a sci-fi movie than an alien invasion movie, as the alien tech we got from the first invasion has transformed our world entirely. More crucially, it's not just us vs the aliens any more. It's us plus some alien robots (apparently with some other aliens) vs the aliens. The new weaponry as well was super cool, even if they did seem to have tracking so untrained users could hit with one hundred percent of their shots.Resurgence is, unsurprisingly, rife with CGI in order to bring this new world order to life. It's used to good effect most of the time; breathing more life and fluidity into the aliens, adding extra detail work to the ships so they're more than just just vague monoliths in the sky, and making the scale of destruction even bigger. By which I mean picking up entire countries worth of landmarks and cities, and dumping them on other countries and cities. Seeing the Petronus towers fall on London Bridge was impressive, although I did wonder why (and how) London and other cities were built back up again, including their ancient, irreplaceable landmarks.So, uh, yeah. I did not rate Resurgence. Not because I wanted something deep and serious, but because it lacked what made the first movie enjoyable despite it's flaws. Resurgence's comedy is completely unfunny (to me at least, the guy behind us seemed to be having a whale of a time laughing every five minutes), and it's corniness was something I thought we had left behind, or at least refined, since the 80s and 90s, but apparently not. It has some interesting ideas, and the base story itself held promise, but there wasn't enough destruction, the action was dull, and the whole thing felt a bit like a soulless parody of the original. I give it a bad, but not completely awful 4/10.",Independence Day - Resurgence
118,MattBrady099,Independence Day: Resurgence - Movie Review,5,26 June 2016,"Independence Day: Resurgence is your basic dumb summer action movie that dose it's job well of entertaining you, but the flaws is something that shouldn't be ignored despite people telling you to ignore them. The effect's (for the most part) was pretty solid and Jeff Goldblum being the best part of this movie is no surprise. You just can't get enough of the Goldblum, as he always got this welcoming presence to him in every movie he's in. I was never bored while watching the movie and this is the kind of the film that would have been great if it was released in the 90's like the first movie, as this would have fitted right in. Unfortunately, ""Resurgence"" misses a lot of the charm and charisma that the first film had, as the squeal is just mindless entertainment and if you enjoy those type of films then you most likely going to like this one. The amount of coincidences that happens in this movie is quite unbelievable, with character's coming across each other by accident or how the problems are solved was way too easy. And it's attempt of humor was a bit awkward and force, but that's mostly because the movie doesn't want to be too dark or serious for audience members, so the humor is thrown in there to lighten up the mood.Overall rating: ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" is a sloppy but enjoyable movie that's only mindless fun....kinda like the first movie in a way.",Independence Day - Resurgence

LOL No Will Smith this time around; apparently he wanted too much doh-ray-mee; well, that's ONE report- either that, or he was too busy finishing up that OTHER movie coming out- Hmmm.... what one could THAT be...??? LOL Pretty much everyone else from the first movie was back for this sequel (well, that wasn't slaughtered in the first one anyways LOL) -- Jeff Goldman, Bill Pullman, Brent Spiner, Vivica Fox, hell even Robert Loggia! (eh-hem, Mr. Smith... confused_rev emoticonO.o ).Well, I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy this movie -- it is what it is, good ol' fashioned ""popcorn entertainment"", plus some really cool FX. And from what I've heard, this is the first of a trilogy director Roland Emmerich/producer-writer Dean Devlin have planned. And, without giving anything away, they give you a little hint about what's to come at the end, and it's actually what I thought would make a great sequel to the original film! So, overall, it's an okay movie, BUT I think the rest of the trilogy are really something more to look forward to- that is, assuming it actually happens. It seems this movie didn't perform up to expectations, domestically anyways. We will see...",Independence Day - Resurgence
120,blackmamba99971,Slightly off centre,5,28 June 2016,"For the most part Roland Emmerich is a very exacting person when it comes to eye candy. Although the newest mother ship of the alien species was much larger than the last one it said to me that part of the fight for the human race was off by an incalculable amount. Characters such as David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), and his father (Judd Hirsch) left a bitter taste in my mouth. The first film had more substance with each actor like Bill Pullman, Vivica Fox, and although Will Smith had no part to play except a dead pilot his son Dylan Hiller, (Jessie T. Usher) had no real exuberance except a gung-ho pilot with Jake issues. Liam Hemsworth in my view had better tact to his role as a man who needed to clear up his past as soon as possible in order to move in the face of annihilation. What was more acceptable this time around apart from the ship which was three thousand miles in diameter was the newest ally in the form of a sphere who came to earth to warn us about the incoming threat. Arming the earth with new technology so that us humans could survive just a little longer. I fear that the franchise has gone too deep, and now suddenly the independence fighters are going to get a new movie in the near future. Since there are other queens such as the one earth destroyed it seems that space will be the fighting field. Whatever the case the dialogue was cheesy, hardly any emotions to speak of, and no kind of connections to any person was felt like the first film had demonstrated. Dean Devlin who helped write the first movie was most likely the screen writer who injected such human emotions to tug at the heart strings of the audience, which was why it had been so successful. It broke world wide box office records. I love this kind of genre, but the screenplay should have been more thought out if the audience was to be captured. Too much eye candy, and too much technology to be believed. It needed more character interaction.",Independence Day - Resurgence

122,stevenrotherforth,They had 20 years to prepare but they didn't bother,6,1 July 2016,"Independence Day : Resurgence Just as it says in the tag line ""They had twenty years to prepare!"" So why didn't they bother? Twenty years people and what do we get? Well here's my thoughts on that. Imagine going to McDonald's and ordering a Big Mac only to find that one of the beef patties is missing! It still looks and feels like a Big Mac only the substance, the essence is missing. So you're pretty disappointed and unsatisfied. It still tasted like what you was expecting only to a lesser extent. That's what IDR is. It's all salad and garnish it has no real substance. Also relating this movie to fast food makes sense because that's what it essentially is. Fast food for the eyes. And while all the glitzy CGI in the world can't make up for what is lacking here. Heart and the aforementioned substance. The film is DOA because we as an audience can't invest or care. When famous landmarks from our world were getting obliterated in the original film we cared, we were on the edge of our seats. Here in this movie twenty years on we have no relation to the world these characters are living in. So the carnage is just eye candy that fails to stay memorable. Unless you have been living on a moon base for the past few weeks you'll probably already know the storyline for this mediocre sequel. The ET's with attitude are coming back and they ain't bringing flowers. While the aliens are on the way we are introduced to characters old and new. Too many characters for my liking. Just when you think you have been subjected to all the characters a film of two hours long can take a bloody bus load of kids show up. I have to say thank god they got Jeff Goldblum to return. Without him this film would have crashed just like the mothership in the first movie. While there's no Will Smith this time we are introduced to his son (not his son in real life) who essentially replaces Smiths character. Problem is he's about as memorable as a particular French fry in a supersize portion of French fries. Thor's younger brother Liam shows up and tries his best with what he's given. You can't really ask anymore from the lad than that. He like his brother has real star quality and he tries to shine as best he can in this dim but not completely dull movie. A particular comical scene where he takes a leak is probably the only real memorable part of the movie.Bill Pullman as President Whitmore is under used. Brent Spiner returns. ""Hang on dude we thought you was dead?"" as the nutty scientist Dr Okun. Also Judd Hirsh returns which like Goldblum is welcome. I don't want to be totally down on this movie as it wasn't completely bad it's just after twenty years of waiting I thought we would have got more. At times the movie just seemed to be borrowing from other movies only they did it better. Alien Queen from the Alien franchise. Ariel dogfights lifted from Star Wars TFA. Even digital carnage from the directors own movie 2012. With twenty years to get the creative juices flowing this is unacceptable to be borrowing concepts from other movies. I left the cinema shrugging my shoulders with the words ringing in my head. ""Is that it?"" Instantly forgetting the experience, and that after twenty years is almost criminal. Still the film could have been Independence Day: regurgitated. A total rehash of the original. So with that rare positive it's a 6 out of 10. Or save your cash and wait for it to be on TV. With the escalating price of cinema tickets you could buy the original on DVD and have change for that Big Mac",Independence Day - Resurgence

125,p-jonsson,"Special effects and action good, story meh...",7,14 March 2017,"Independence Day: Resurgence is pretty much what I expected. Actually, given all the negative reviews floating around, it is almost better than what I expected. As is almost always the case, all the 1 and 2 star ratings and ""worst movie ever"" reviews are pure bullshit. The biggest advantage the original movie had was the novelty of it all. This movie is really pretty much the same except for the special effects being even bigger to the extent that they are somewhat over the top at times and the plot somewhat thinner. Having said the latter, the original movie did not really have much in terms of plot either and the nonsense of giving a totally alien computer a virus was so bad it really dragged down the movie.In the relatively short timespan of two decades humanity have improved their technology base by several orders of magnitude (ray guns on the moon etc. etc). The speed of improvement is of course pretty unrealistic, even with access to alien technology, but hey, I can live with that in order to increase the coolness factor of the movie.Then comes an alien ship. Not the aliens we all expected by another one. The ship is totally different from the previous ones, do not seem aggressive but of course dumbass politicians manage to screw everything up. Fast forward a couple of scenes and the ""real"" aliens arrive. Of course this time they have a bigger flyswatter and they perfunctorily proceed to swat away the puny, extremely slow firing, little ray guns of the humans and we are back to where we started in the original movie. Huge space ship parks on Earth, time for plan B.Well there were quite a few scenes of big space ships, destruction and mayhem before the aliens finally manage to park their spaceship. I guess finding a parking space for a 5 000 kilometer space ship can be a bit tricky (I though I had an issue with my Jeep). Here is were I have quite some gripes about the movie. The special effects are cool, no question about it, but they are also exaggerated and throws any attempt to be remotely adhering to the laws of physics out the window. It is clear that whatever low intelligence storywriter that wrote that garbage flunked science classes in school, if he ever got that far of course. For instance, we have a 5 000 kilometer (the Earth radius is about 6 370 kilometer) that is big enough to generate its own gravity (apparently the engines somehow contributed to this) flies in and lands on earth. When it approaches items on the surface, cars, trains, ships, skyscrapers and bits and pieces of the Earth itself starts to fly upwards. It makes for cool effects but anyone with a mediocrum of intelligence ought to realize that such a force would actually destabilize Earth itself. Possibly change the speed of rotation as well as the orbit around the sun.The story is full of other typical Hollywood stupidities and plot holes. Christ even my kids could spot the plot holes which were often big enough to drive a battleship through! As for the acting. Well, I would say there is not too much to say about it. Most of the main actors managed to make it through the movie without screwing up too badly. Given that it was not the deepest or thought provoking movie one could imagine I would say that was good enough. The best character in my opinion was Judd Hirsch as Julius Levinson. The worst one was probably Dr. Okun. Not that Brent Spiner was making a bad job of representing him but the character was just to crazed out for my taste.Okay, I will stop whining now. This movie was pretty much exactly what I expected. Great special effects tied together with a paper thin story. I went into it hoping that the effects were going to be good with little expectations on the rest and that is exactly what I got. The movie fulfilled my expectations completely and thus I consider it worth 7 out of 10 stars. I enjoyed the two hours watching it.",Independence Day - Resurgence
126,dcarsonhagy,Independence 2 - Regurgitation,2,20 October 2016,"Coming in right at two hours (one minute short), this has to be one of the worst movies ever created. The first one was hackneyed, cliché, and pretty unbelievable, but at least that film tried to have some sort of heart. The sequel is constant CGI, with a paper thin story line, horrible acting, and characters you really don't care about. Will Smith is absent here, but can you blame him?Seems the mother ship (in Part 1) has just sorta' hung around since we clobbered those pesky aliens, but little did we know it has sent out a distress call which is finally answered. The queen of all queens has come to, I don't know, free her babies? Look menacingly at the cameras? Sounds good to me. Far be it from me to point out the obvious: there is no way in hell Earth could defeat her, but I digress. Oh, with all these amazing aliens and their toys present, it's also nice to know a school bus loaded with kids can out run the ""Queen.""This is yet another example of why some of the writers (nudge/nudge, wink/wink) in Hollywood should be hung up by their thumbs. Another pitiful sequel with the only thing on anyone's mind is making a fast buck. Glad it tanked at the box office. This film has no heart, no soul, and is oh-so-boring to watch.

You figure that'd be enough time to come up with a really cool script.Maybe there was one — maybe they had a really great screenplay that was thrown out for some reason at the very last minute. (Political correctness? Copyright issues? Internal studio politics?) Then this by-the-numbers, live-action ""G.I. Joe"" cartoon was hastily thrust in front of the cameras. What we've got here is really just a lot of common tropes strung together by a thin story, performed by cliché stock characters. The charm, surprises, humor and impact of the (admittedly silly) original film is entirely absent here.Don't get me wrong. ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" isn't quite as bad as some other reviewers might make it seem. There's some fun to be had, especially if the kid in you still gets a kick out of gooey aliens.

I'd give it a 6 out of 10, and I'd caution you to wait until you pay a dollar for it at Redbox.Postscript: given what the movie reveals as their goal, why don't the aliens just nuke us from orbit?

128,scottshak_111,What a colossal disaster!,6,21 July 2016,"Independence Day: Resurgence turns out to be a huge bummer. Given the crazy levels Independence Day had managed to scintillate in us, we were expecting something as huge as the prequel. Unfortunately it is nothing compared to its epic first instalment. The fact that it doesn't even come close to a decent alien movie will make you resent it even more.DOWNSIDES OF INDEPENDENCE DAY: RESURGENCE There isn't just one downside to pinpoint because the whole movie is strewn with countless shortcomings. Beginning with the shoddy direction of Roland Emmerich, you might at once take it from Independence Day: Resurgence that the guy's still living in the 80s era. Any effort becomes an exercise in futility if you are not thoughtful enough. Roland showcases his childish unspooled head through reckless frames as he defines the prime basis of his movie, which happens to be nothing but bringing back the aliens and go shooting at them ""ptchoo ptchoo"".There are so many cheesy dialogues in the movie, feigned heroism from protagonists, weird reprisal plans, and plenty of role revivals that it is hard to take the movie seriously even for a second. There are hundreds of moments in the movie where you will go, ""Are you kidding me?"" SPOILER SPACESHIPS AHEAD: The screenplay is the worst. When all Madam President Lanford, played by Sela Ward, could manage at crucial moments, ""Let's do it"" without giving an eye to repercussions; You could not help but imagine if something like this happens to us in reality, we are doomed for sure.Everybody keeps reminding you every now and then that the events are actually taking place 20 years after. They use 20 years so many times that it could end up becoming a drinking game for you.Bill Pullman, as President Whitmore, keeps showing up at places where he is not needed, and everybody just lets him pass. There is one African dude who kills Aliens with swords and says:""You have to get them from behind."" It becomes so lame and cheesy with dialogues like that that you have to watch the Independence Day: Resurgence to really believe it.Jessie T. Usher is a bad replacement of Will Smith who is shoehorned just for the sake of Will remnants. Choosing Suicide Squad over Independence Day: Resurgence is one of the best decisions of Will, hands down.Including China seems very much forced. Putting in Chinese actors just for the sake of moolah is quite apparent to be candid.THE FINAL VERDICT Whilst at one end we see painstaking efforts from great directors like Christopher Nolan, James Cameron and Ridley Scott making next to impeccable alien movies, it is sad to see how Roland Emmerich doesn't give two rats about what you want to see.The only bright side to the movie could be that you get to see many characters reprise their roles. It might fling you in some nostalgic daydreaming. That and some cool visuals when the alien mother-ship tries to land on Earth. Everything else is simply stupid.There is nothing serious going on in Independence Day: Resurgence.

Usher, Bill Pullman, Maika Monroe, Sela Ward.Plot: Set 20 years after the events of Independence Day, an even more aggressive alien comes for the attack but with the Earth at the brink of extinction, will the new defenses save the day? It has been 20 years since Independence Day that's right 20 years ago since the Oscar winning predecessor, and this extremely pretty good looking sequel brings on feelings of immense nostalgia it is very action packed with the story being a little bit hit and miss. Is this as good as the first one? no it is not it's entertaining but but were-as the first one had cheesy elements and amazing action this has both but with the first you it felt like an an amazing sci-fi action packed ride which this was as well but a little more flat than the first one. The casting is just incredible starring an okay but good deliverer of the story Liam Hemsworth it even has the original cast like Jeff Goldblum and Bill Pullman etc. However the story in this one is okay along with the dialog all the dialog is very silly but that's to be expected. The character development isn't there though I mean we learn their names and that's pretty much it, apart from the usual stuff this movie is very pretty especially with the special effects and the action and the ship is much bigger in size and it's all very pretty, but the story fails to deliver. Director Roland Emmerich is good at a few things making sci-fi and destruction engines in movies for example 2012 (2009) and that's another thing he does well in this movie. It has a very good destructive element and also very good and immense action. On the low point this has a very connection with the first especially with the elimination of Will Smith although the director said that he had died in a freak accident somehow after the first movie. I just want to state that the CGI is also brilliant as well if a little schlocky in some areas but that's because these types of movies it never is perfect but the movie isn't either. There are some things but not many things wrong with this film mainly the fact that it isn't as good as the first. On a slow point the movie gets another thing right apart from the explosive action it is paced to incredible standards there is action as to be expected but also in between them visceral moments there is also an okay pace to the story, also the introduction to a much meaner and much larger alien this real was just a popcorn blast, and sometimes that's just what you want to watch. In terms of this years summer blockbusters this is entertaining and certainly not disappointing like Gods of Egypt (2016) which was just used to look pretty. This is actually a pretty okay sequel and very enjoyable it makes me want to get the fireworks early.Verdict: Gorgeous and entertaining sequel with added feelings of intense nostalgia.

130,kgprophet,It's The End of The World - Again,4,24 June 2016,"I haven't seen a big blockbuster movie about the end of the world since - last Tuesday. Complaints were piling up already about the movie ""X Men: Apocalypse"" being too similar to other recent blockbusters with Earth-destroying machines as the big dilemma. Yet, here we are with another 90s revival, this time with the big alien invasion movie. And aren't we all tired of aliens? There was a chorus of groans when Indiana Jones faced off with aliens in Peru. There was a definite 'thud' sound when they tried to mix Cowboys and Aliens. I know that plans were around for many years to make a sequel of ID4, why not? It made a gazillion dollars and ushered in the over-the-top special effects extravaganza that the team of Devlin and Emmerich capitalized off of for many years afterward. I remember how eager I was to see the movie ""2012"", only to be bored to tears with schmaltzy scenes of dopey drama that felt like filler between the big effects shots. In contrast, the movie ""San Andreas"" demonstrated that you can make a big disaster movie that is actually tolerable to watch. I will say that if you are really a huge fan of the original, you may enjoy the nostalgia of re-visiting some of the major characters from the first film. But somehow they aren't as engaging as the first film. The first film had a solid undertone of tension as the impending invasion began from the first scene. This film lacks that similar tension, yet the story here relies on the impending doom of the planet to have us care about, well everybody. One main character missing from the first film is Will Smith. We now understand why he turned down doing this film. It seems that throwing in a large amount of story ideas would make up for a dead-on-arrival retread. ""This time the alien ships are even bigger"" and ""This time Area 51 is a big spaceport"" didn't really get me excited. For the most part the screenplay gets too convoluted that it forgets one of the main tenets of a popcorn movie, which is a sense of fun. Instead we must act like we care about the underdog pilot who got in trouble with the other popular pilot (who is the Will Smith replacement and is absolutely bland), and we must care about the fiancé and the daughter in the White House and the Dad on the boat and the blah blah blah. Brent Spiner is perhaps the only engaging character, returning as the goofy scientist who has the most knowledge about alien technology. The one idea I wish they scrapped was that Earth now had Star Wars technology, and we all lived in the future now. It made us less vulnerable to the advanced alien technology, and it turned the entire film into some light fantasy instead of 'our world'. I think of the attention grabbing teaser trailer for ID4 where a NYPD officer forgets to direct traffic, causing an armoured truck to smash, while he gaped at the alien spaceship over the city. This film is just a series of CGI shots of everyone zipping around in their Jetsons flying cars. This isn't 'our world'. I had a hard time caring about most of the new characters, and felt somewhat sorry for how many of the returning characters were marginalised. The one exception is Jeff Goldbum, who has the most screen time and has the best chance of keeping the film lively with his famous wit. Something strange happened when some actors from other disaster movies appeared in this film, it was hard to keep track of what the actor's character is supposed to be in this film as opposed to the other disaster film. Ultimately, even though some of the big effects shots were cool, the supporting elements didn't create solid momentum to make everything connect together cohesively. Perhaps knowing that we would outsmart the aliens again, I wasn't engaged with the big climatic moment. I think why audiences aren't getting excited about end-of-the- world and alien apocalypse films is that after we all survived the big 2012 scare (it turns out that the Mayans were warning us about the film not the year). So now it's 'Been there, done that'. Only some nifty CGI kept me watching. Again, only if you absolutely loved the first film and would be content just to see Jeff Goldblum make some snarky wisecracks again, then you will enjoy yourself. If you are tired of end-of-the-world over-the-top bigger-is-better extravaganzas, then skip this film.",Independence Day - Resurgence

Created by Liberals for Liberals?,2,23 November 2016,"This movie was created for kids who simply do not care about movies, but rather the hype surrounding a movie***Cough***Force Awakens***Cough Where to start? The awful lead....wait who was the lead character? There was no lead. In the original you had Pullman, Will Smith and Goldblum, all charismatic guys. This movie seemed to be created by Liberals, for Liberals.All the machismo and fun and great lines that made the first movie charming is gone. Instead we have close up shots, poor acting, bad writing and CGI everywhere. Where is the friendship and story? The token Black guy, supposedly Hiller's son, is awful. Will Smith is a bad actor, but can light up a room with his personality. His son in the movie, is a bad lead, un-fun and has no personality.This story was all over the place. It tried to copy the original and made it worse. The characters were all bland and boring. They did such a poor job.Where is the macho men? Where is the stereotypical Jew? Where is the stripper with the heart of gold? Where is the friendship and camaraderie? Where is the guy who we all know is gay, but we still make fun of and love him anyway? Where is the attitude? I give it 2 out of10. This is a dead sequel that may have ruined the original. This movie has no fun, or macho camaraderie or a good script. THIS IS A DISASTER!

You have big budgets to create amazing special effects, but not to write a decent story with interesting characters? I was not expecting a masterpiece considering the genre, but not even this garbage: nonsensical story lines, that are there just to hit the 2 hours marker, people every time that fire scream, which is very annoying, characters that can survive for a miracle. Let's put in the mix a little bit of romance, the classic American patriotism and actors of every possible race, even if they are useless and they basically do nothing, just to be politically correct. I am happy that Hollywood became open minded, but please don't put an asian or an afro-american actor just for the sake of it. Instead try to give him/her an interesting role.Very disappointed overall, as Independence Day is part of my teenage years and I was really expecting a lot from it. I suppose that they will make a sequel, considering what happened in the end. Let's just hope that they will make something interesting.",Independence Day - Resurgence
133,Danny_G13,Extremely forced Hollywood popcorn - with on-screen stroke,6,14 January 2017,"Weak sci fi sequel (see 'remake') of 96's half decent Independence Day where the aliens are bigger, the guns louder, and the CGI shinier.I'm not entirely sure why, beyond profit, Hollywood thought this film was ever necessary. I mean technically I guess I've just answered my own question, but even then, this was a truly pointless exercise in movie-making which might not have been diabolical, but truly was an average affair in story telling and a dreadful one in acting (more on that later).In short those alien dudes are back. Only this time it's actually...for the exact same reason as before with some idiotic mumbo jumbo about another alien race. A great deal of returns are seen, with huge cheques clearly waved in aging faces with reprises of Goldlum's Levinson, Hursh's 'his dad', Pullman's president, Spiner's Okun, while the marquee name of Will Smith had much better things to do so they got Chris Hemsworth to be the 'underated hero'.The above do their best to try to take this rubbish seriously and in all fairness make a fair fist of it, but it's the curious decision to cast art-house 'legend' Charlotte Gainsbourg in the role of 'Jeff Goldblum's ex' which puzzles the most. Her style of delivery may work in the subterranean world of abstract cinema, but in this epic it was like watching a child struggling with an ongoing stroke - the woman could barely deliver her lines, speaking slower than someone with a genuine impediment, completely at contrast with the furious pace Emerich's direction was going at and that of whatever poor fool she was playing opposite in any given scene was. It was painful and it absolutely destroyed every moment she spoke.Jessie T Usher was the replacement 'token black guy to replace Will Smith' and he actually did a reasonable job of not being too jingoistically goofy but was betrayed by an atrocious 'close encounters' 'gag'.Special effects were pretty good, but with the budget thrown at this that's not surprising, and the thinly fleshed subplots (two enemy heroes become friends, nerd becomes warrior, other nerd tries to get the girl, and creepy old man takes in a group of 15 year olds for no apparent reason) both strain and plain confuse.And yet for all the patent rubbishness of the plot, the acting, the forced nonsense before us which is basically Independence Day 2016, it is still weirdly quite entertaining. Emerich's aforementioned direction is fast, slick, and does a good job of keeping our attention while those shiny CGI this and thats entertain our eyes if not our brain.In terms of substance, this is a zero. It's is horrendous. But it's stylish silly substance which may have absolutely no brain and barely a believable heart but it has lungs and eyes which somehow make it work.It's Hollywood blockbuster nonsense by the numbers yet somehow it works. Just.",Independence Day - Resurgence
134,dvc5159,You're gonna need a bigger movie,4,21 June 2016,"I recently re-watched the first film and was surprised at how robust its shelf life is. Again, it is undeniably cheesy and jingoistic, but done suitably well, I can have a ball with any material. In ""Independence Day: Resurgence"", set and finally released 20 years after the events of the first film, the aliens get medieval on us with an even bigger mothership.There's a lot of heroics here by many a character who do their equal part to stop this new alien menace, having already made a stuffed calzone of the Earth's crust comprising from London all the way to Singapore. There's also a refreshingly silly undertone which sets it apart from the grim and serious blockbusters of today, and with added Jeff Goldblum and Judd Hirsch who return as the Levinsons, and ""Star Trek"" alumnus Brent Spiner as the eccentric Dr. Okun, Emmerich and his co-writers, including returning scribe Dean Devlin, certainly did not skimp out on the comic silliness.Unfortunately, that is where the similarities end. The sins of sequelitis has been bestowed upon this sequel to his 1996 smash hit, and Emmerich is to blame, either for his laziness to phone it in out of frustration to fulfill the fans; or bucking in to studio demand to condense the film into a mere 2 hours. Sure, lots of things happen in the film, including stuff and cities going kablooey in high style, and high-tech aerial dogfights to give ""Star Wars"" a run for its money. Even Liam Hemsworth as the new hero Jake Morrison did not annoy me as much as I expected, though Hemsworth is still a far cry from Will Smith's ""Elvis has left the building!"" persona.However, as slick as the modern CGI is, giving a sleeker look to the tech shown in the original film, it never quite gels together as a cohesive film - no momentum, no suspense, no catharsis when it does end. Bill Pullman's returning ex-President Thomas Whitmore is utterly wasted, as per his daughter Patricia (Maika Monroe, not doing her rep from ""It Follows"" any favours). It is not their fault; I feel that there is a lot of footage Emmerich was forced to excise by the Fox bigwigs to get more butts into cinema seats. Perhaps an extra half- hour of more cataclysmic destruction and character motives, but I may be asking for a bit too much at this point.Things are very rushed indeed, with no payoff even when there's lots of characters doing their fair share to save the day. Goldblum and Hirsch, however, are still naturals, and they steal every scene they're in, and lift the movie up from near tediousness. Nevertheless, the special effects are fantastic, and are most certainly worth the price of admission alone.It's kind of sad. This new one promotes global equality, with a female U.S. President (Sela Ward) celebrating world peace, and with everyone from across the globe giving it their all to kick E.T.'s ass. The action is fine and dandy without any of those annoying shaky-cam and quick-cut edits. And yet, the film suffers from awkward pacing, rushed dynamics, and especially a lack of cities exploding into fireballs. It even has sequel-teasing in the laziest manner possible in its final moments.To quote Marvin the Martian, ""Where's the kaboom? There's supposed to be an Earth-Shattering Kaboom!""",Independence Day - Resurgence
135,shawneofthedead,Hardly surprising but a shame nonetheless: this sequel sinks where its predecessor soars.,3,11 July 2016,"Twenty years is a long time. It's enough time for new nations to be born, and old ones to crumble into obscurity. It's certainly enough time for the first Independence Day movie to pass into something akin to legend. There was an unmistakable joy and charm to its wanton destruction of Earth's major landmarks, using cutting-edge special effects, that created a new template for pretty much every disaster movie that followed. Sadly, it's a template that the dull, bloated Independence Day: Resurgence follows, almost slavishly, with far less success.The plot is simple: the aliens that were defeated in Independence Day are back, and more determined than ever to decimate entire cities. But, as we have already established, twenty years is a long time. Children orphaned in the first attack are grown up and ready to contribute to the war effort, like maverick-with-a-heroic-streak Jake (Liam Hemsworth) and his sidekick buddy Charlie (Travis Tope).Of course, there's rivalry and romantic tension riddled throughout the hero squad: Jake did something terrible to Dylan (Jessie Usher) – son of Steven Hiller, Will Smith's much-loved and now deceased character from the first film – in their academy days. Charlie has the hots for nigh-monosyllabic Chinese pilot Rain (Angelababy). Jake must save the world but also his fiancée, Patricia (Maika Monroe) who just happens to be the daughter of former President Thomas Whitmore (Bill Pullman). Don't mind the erstwhile Commander-in-Chief as he slowly goes loopy from the alien symbols he's drawing from his nightmares. Meanwhile, scientist David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) jumps from African crater to moon crash site, discovering various sciencey-wiencey things that either herald mankind's doomsday or salvation.To be honest, it's a simple story but one that's told in a frustratingly dense, unnecessarily complex way. The story lines drift, race or stumble drunkenly from 'plot' point to 'plot' point, barely stopping to give the characters time to breathe or grow into anything resembling real people. Does Jake run an illegal transport service to the moon? How does he know Levinson? Who thinks flying directly into the mouth of an enemy mothership is an excellent war tactic? Exactly how much was art-house French actress Charlotte Gainsbourg paid to play her incongruous role in this film? Independence Day: Resurgence is the kind of blithely dumb movie in which all sorts of questions pile up but are almost never answered.The film as a whole would be more tolerable, at least, if its characters weren't so painfully underserved by the script. Most of them are cardboard cutouts, struggling to seem vaguely human against never-ending explosions of special effects. This is especially true of the characters who make their debuts in this film. Hemsworth's rakish Jake is far from awe-inspiring. Usher is too bland to conjure up the electricity that runs through Will Smith's veins in his best roles. Angelababy is, as the Mandarin phrase goes, a 'flower vase' – decorative, pretty (and proof positive of Chinese cash dumped in large amounts into the film's coffers), but useless. Even Sela Ward's President Lanford is more of an afterthought than a character.To be fair, there's some fun to be had when franchise veterans pop up. Goldblum, with his deadpan delivery and spot-on comic timing, remains a delight. Brent Spiner (as newly awakened coma patient Dr. Brackish Okun) and Judd Hirsch (as David's loopy and unnaturally lucky dad, Julius) pull off comic turns worthy of a few giggles. Independence Day: Resurgence doesn't have much of an emotional core, but what little there is comes courtesy of Pullman, who injects a little heartfelt tragedy into Whitmore, now a war hero haunted by post-traumatic stress who must find the will to fight again.Of course, the main draw of a brainless blockbuster film like Independence Day: Resurgence is its special effects. We're not even supposed to really care about plot and character in pure spectacle movies like this one. On that count, the film fares well enough. The aliens are suitably realistic, as is the fire and mayhem rained down on landmarks all over the world. But, in this day and age of CGI and limitless visual invention, it's far from ground-breaking. You've seen it all before, probably in another Roland Emmerich movie, and possibly done better: Independence Day: Resurgence is so lazily and haphazardly edited together that the action sequences may look great, but they don't always make a lot of narrative sense.Oddly, what Emmerich seems to have forgotten – in this go-for-broke cheeseball genre that he had a hand in inventing – is the element of fun. There are a few funny moments, sure, painstakingly designed for (overly deliberate) comic relief. And yet, the almost palpable awe and joy that accompany viewings of Independence Day never really materialise for this sequel. Visually, the film is an assault on the senses: big, bonkers and occasionally great to behold. But it fails, quite badly, in capturing hearts and imaginations the way its predecessor did, all those years ago.",Independence Day - Resurgence

Unfortunately, the dramatic structure contains (way) too much comic relief, making it a ""funny movie"" instead of what it could have been.Finally, the concept art is beautiful (congratulations on the great work!), but a little bit too much has been ""borrowed"" from Alien/H.

I don't claim it's better or as good as the original but it had some fun moments. The biggest problem was that Will Smith was out of the picture. It was good to see Bill Pullman and Jeff Goldblum back in their respective roles and some new faces to boot. I rented the blu ray and watched the deleted scenes, which added more meat to the movie's bones.

Seriously, I can't believe how badly this ""movie"" was made, it's such a crying shame. I love the first ""Independence Day"" film, it's probably the best disaster film in history! So of course I had high hopes for a sequel if they ever produced one. When I first heard they were going to make a sequel, I was a little skeptical at first. Then, I thought: ""well, they had 20 years to come up with a good story. This movie should be a masterpiece if they fully utilized their 20 years coming up with it!"" Then, I found out Will Smith wasn't going to be in it, he was one of the biggest highlights of the original movie. Finding out that he wasn't going to be in the sequel, that made me lose hope for this ""movie"". But, I gave it a fair chance and thought: ""it may be good, even if Will Smith isn't in the movie. They had 20 years to produce it!"" Wow, was I wrong about it. This ""movie"" has a very boring and cliched story, overused sets/locations, the acting is all over the place, and the soundtrack is over produced and generic. The only good element in this ""movie"" are it's special effects, which is a given in modern movies and shows. It's not an especially long ""movie"", but when I watched it, I felt like I was watching it for days! Absolutely terrible, I could've wrote a better script! The plot for this ""movie"" should've been what they had in store for the third one. Where they use the spaceship and go over to the alien planet, fight the aliens, and finally wipe them all out for good. That would've been the smart thing to do for the story, and it would've contrasted with the first one as far as story goes. Don't get me wrong, sequels should have some references to the original film, but it should still be it's own distinct movie. What a horrible excuse for a ""movie"" this is. ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" sucks! I give it only 1 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 2 out of 10 IMDB stars. On a final note, there is one thing about this ""film"" that really adds salt to the wound. The tagline on the poster! ""WE HAD TWENTY YEARS TO PREPARE-SO DID THEY"". That's a pretty bold statement to put on the poster. If you're going to include a tagline with such a message as powerful as that, then it had better be a great movie! Which of course this ""movie"" was not the slightest bit good whatsoever. Stay away from this ""movie"", just go and watch the first ""Independence Day"" (1996) movie instead.

Resurgance picks up 20 years after Jeff Goldblum and Will Smith helped save the world from an alien invasion. As a species we have embraced the alien technology we captured and set up a global/space wide defence system, but all is woefully inadequate. Independence Day is one of those films I can watch over and over, and twenty years on Resurgance will probably be the sequel I keep picking off my DVD shelf to enjoy a movie double bill. The advances in film making are obvious, we have come a long way in 20 years and this latest instalment is a good solid job. Lots of old faces, Jeff Goldblum as David Levenson, Judd Hirsch as his irascible father Julius, Bill Pullman as President Whitmore, and Brent Spiner as the brilliant Dr Okun, come together with the younger members of the cast to tell this story of earth's battle for survival. There is an amazing collection of aircraft as space craft, many resembling current military planes I.

141,Rendanlovell,A mess of nonsense,4,25 June 2016,"It's been twenty years since we saw the white house go up in flames on the big screen. Now, with 'Independence Day 2' we don't get to see practically anything like that. In a summer with bunches of unnecessary sequels this one standouts as one that should have left the first film alone. This time around the planet is kind of stronger from using alien tech. But when the aliens come back earth is ""no match"" for the now, much more evolved alien race. And the movie we get from this is basically identical to the first with only minor cosmetic changes being made. Other than that this movie follows a near identical plot line to the original and hardly ever deviates from it. Doing this not only made this film wildly predictable but uneven and boring. When you can see every plot point that the movie is going to hit long before it hits them, there really is nothing it can do to shock you. But at least the action is cool like the first right? Wrong. Hardly anything happens in this ""action"" movie. If I remember correctly, there are only four or five actions sequences. All lasting less than five minutes. One of which includes the wide scale destruction that one would naturally expect going in. So that leaves nearly an hour and a half of screen time in this ""action"" movie where hardly anything happens. If it's not men standing in a circle in some kind of war room than it's obligatory sequel set up that is anything but subtle.But the most glaring issue is how hamfisted everything feels. For the first thirty minutes all we get is one exposition dump after another. It reads the script directly to the audience and moves to the next scene and does the same thing. There is nothing smart about this kind of writing. Clearly telling the audience how the war changed the planet and then pretending that the president is reading a speech to herself is not good writing.For one, why was she reading this speech out loud? Two, doesn't everyone on earth already know this information? Which means the only thing that movie is doing is telling the audience this obligatory info without actually trying to come up with an interesting way to do it. Things like this happen over and over again through out the movie. It never actually lets you get invested in the movie.That's because it just reads off a check list of things that happened in the last twenty years straight to your face. There's nothing interesting about that. It's like sitting in a library and listening to someone read the script to you. There's even a scene where the mad scientist doctor from the first film is in a coma. And his nurse walks in and says,""I can't believe you've been in a coma for 7,300 days.""Like seriously? Why would he ever say that out loud if it weren't to alert the audience to how long he was out. What's worse is that he says it again when the guy wakes up. So why blatantly tell the audience that same piece of information twice? This sloppy writing even translates to the dialogue. Which was so stiff and forced that nearly ever actor in the movie had trouble making it sound natural.The only actors in the entire film that gave good performances were Jeff Goldblum and Bill Pullman. For me, Jeff Goldblum stole the show. Even the with the terrible script that he had, he made it work. This kind of weird manic dialogue is his bread and butter. And I sincerely wish he had more screen time.The only other tribute I can give the film is it's VFX. Which were seriously impressive. Aside from the occasional super noticeable green screen, they did a great job with them. But if you take these few positives out of the movie, there isn't much to be impressed with. It's long, uneven, and so predictable that it becomes bland. Shoving cool special effects and nostalgia in your face can only go so far and for this movie it really doesn't go that far at all.",Independence Day - Resurgence

143,themadmovieman,Completely misses the spirit of Independence Day,4,23 June 2016,"Independence Day may have been dumb, but at least it had spirit, gusto and charisma. Resurgence, on the other hand, is even dumber, and is one of the dullest, most lifeless films I've ever seen. For a series that at first emphasised all of humanity's relentless will to survive, this sequel is a sad example of Hollywood not putting in the effort just for a quick payday.I was no fan of the first film, but in comparison to the utter mess that is Resurgence, it now looks like the greatest film ever made. Independence Day: Resurgence does not feature one single moment of tension, excitement or awe; its pathetic story is absolutely all over the place from start to finish, and the unacceptably thin and formulaic characters give you no reason whatsoever to care about anything that's happening on screen.I understand completely that this is meant to be a big, dumb action fest, but the main reason why I can't look past the awful story in Resurgence as I did for the first film is simply because it has no heart to it. The first film saved itself and made a moderately engaging watch through its passion and patriotism, always pushing the idea that humanity will always come through in some way or other.Here, on the other hand, there are two awful speeches that attempt to recapture that glory, and then the rest is all a horrific rip-off of Star Wars. Despite having the potential to look at how alien technology has changed the Earth over the last twenty years, Resurgence dumps a likely intriguing story for an ugly special effects extravaganza that we've seen a million times before.The point I want to get across here is that, despite being a big, hulking 90s disaster movie, Independence Day succeeded thanks to its sheer passion and huge heart. That's why most people remember it fondly, and I'm afraid to say that's the reason that Resurgence, a lifeless and unacceptably formulaic cashgrab, is going to feel like an even more crushing disappointment.And there's one final catch. Just as the first film kicked off 90s disaster movies, Resurgence looks like the beginning of a horrific new trend: pandering to Chinese audiences. The Chinese box office is effectively the biggest in the world now, and this film is a clear indication of Hollywood's desire to get in there quickly. I've got no problem with lead Chinese characters, but when we've got product placement for QQ and 酸奶 in one of the most American movies ever, there's a serious problem.Overall, I was horrified at how bad Independence Day: Resurgence is. Its visuals may be detailed and extravagant, but not even that makes it an enjoyable popcorn fest. The film is a painfully lifeless and dull affair, with a story all over the place, and most disappointingly, completely missing the entire spirit of the original movie that so many loved.",Independence Day - Resurgence
144,eshwarmail,An unnecessary reboot that is dumber and cringy than any of the Transformers movies and thats the lowest I can rate.,1,26 June 2016,"Roland Emmerich while being quite active on the Hollywood scene albeit sticking to disaster genre, feels like he has been the one in coma since 1996 rather than Dr. Okun. 'Too many cooks spoil a dish' is a famous saying which fits like a glove to this spectacularly dumb and in- cohesive story-line that needed 4 story-writers and 5 for screenplay credits. Independence Day (1996) holds a special place for me as it was the first Hollywood movie I had seen in my hometown theater, the sheer spectacle and the rousing moments was enough for that age to register it in my mind as a classic. For the same technical and acting cast to come back and make a mess out of it was just unnecessary.After the victory from an alien invasion in 1996 under the 'heroic' guidance of President Whitmore (Bill Pullman) and 'genius' of cable-man David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), Earth has built its sophisticated defense system leveraging the Alien technology that spans across Saturn and Moon. President Whitmore and score of others who were exposed to the aliens during the previous invasion frequently are haunted by visions of a sphere (think 'Close encounters of the 3rd kind') which they assume to be the form in which they are going to invade again. When such a sphere does show up, the current technology blasts it to smithereens. Is that the end of it or is it just the beginning?Generally a movie cannot be a classic by itself, it can only be a classic for a certain generation of movie watchers. Independence Day (1996) is a classic for kids who watched it in theaters the extravaganza that was never seen before during its time. Technology moves on, aesthetics moves on, method of movie-making moves on but Roland Emmerich seems to be stuck on a time loop through these changes. Most of the returning cast does no better either and their standard stoop further low making the experience more cringe worthy than one would anticipate. The new cast members seems to play along rather than add something fresh, difficult to blame them with the such pedestrian writing. There must be multiple templates that comes pre-built with visual effects software these days regarding destruction of entire cities, everyone seems to be using a different version of it with ease, but it just has become plain boring. The writing is contrived and riddled with holes and it ends up being a never ending list if I have to document each one of them. Every character does something stupid just to drive the plot like in the B-grade horror movies of the 80s and its always in the worst possible direction. Will Smith made a great career choice by not being a part of this, but his inclusion could have brought in some much needed moments just through his charisma and comic timing.An unnecessary reboot that is dumber and cringy than any of the Transformers movies and thats the lowest I can rate.",Independence Day - Resurgence
145,ritera1,"Impressive in its massive scope, but little else.",6,22 December 2017,"I personally found that the destruction scenes when the massive ship appears very terrifying, just like the destruction and hopelessness in 2012. Nobody would agree vs. the cartoon nature of this, but that was my takeaway.Although amusing characters mostly propped up by very good actors, I generally didn't care about or was emotionally invested in the people. Maybe that was a way to disengage in the vast death that the story suggested but didn't want you to dwell upon. Thus, allowed more room for comic relief and resolute melodrama instead of being a giant bummer. And with such a large cast, there is really wasn't any time for character development.Very stupid at the beginning as the moon shot down the good guy with no provocation and then they decided to not bother investigating such until the ""celebration"" was over? Pathetic. The world did not have such resources to do BOTH?Flash forward a bit and then we're at the vague but way-too-fast dogfights. These are space ship battles that invariably come up in many big movies and started with the speeder chase in Return of the Jedi. That was the first instance where they sped up the action for the effect but was way beyond human reflexes. (And laserblasts. With all the advancements in special effects, they still look as dumb as they did in the '70s.)There were a few good moments in detail in the action with the school bus chase and the jet crash, but a vast majority of it was very large and very vague.I'm still lost on why exactly that white ball was so important vs. just obtaining the Earth's core, but I have no interest in watching it again to find out. I'll take their word for it this once.So, not really worth the time. (But maybe there's room for a bunch of tiny movies about the aftermath.)",Independence Day - Resurgence
146,srdjan_veljkovic,"Hopefully, producers of this movie won't defend us from the aliens",4,3 July 2016,"It comes down to this: it takes itself too seriously and nobody, except Brent Spinner (better known as ""Data"" :) ) had fun doing it.The original knew it was silly beyond repair, but, it went with it, not taking itself too seriously. Most of the crew seemed to have had fun doing it.Most of that is gone in the sequel. I'm guessing they wanted to go the ""dark"" route. But, in that case they would have had to ""tone down the silly"" so much that the whole thing would not be recognizable.Also, the original had some pretty unbelievable ideas (like figuring out how to upload a virus to alien ship - what, they too are buying their CPUs from Intel?). But, they were, well, at least in theory, possible (they are not buying from Intel, of course, but, maybe their CPU technology is similar enough to ours and Jeff Goldblum is such a genius that he figured theirs out with next to nothing to go on), and, if you suspend disbelief, made sense.The sequel has some stuff that just doesn't make sense. A lot of it dealing with the final battle with the alien queen. While it is possible that the queen just can't control the fusion drive of her ships, it doesn't make sense that she loses control of the ship totally if the fusion drive burns up - what, she controls the ship via the fusion drive which she doesn't control!? It is as if the crew just didn't have it in them to finish the whole thing in a satisfying way.There are some interesting elements from which a sequel that would be more in line with the original could have been made. So, this feels like a (big) misfire and that's why I hope producers of this movie won't defends us from the aliens - we can't afford misfires with the aliens.",Independence Day - Resurgence

148,darkreignn,I went to see this instead of watching fireworks... big mistake,2,4 July 2016,"I don't like fireworks. Never did. I didn't want to waste my time watching them, so instead I decided to go and see ""Independence Day: Resurgence."" I've never regretted a decision more in my life.Wow. You ever sit in a class room, and while the teacher is talking you just kind of zone out, and then about ten minutes later you jump back to reality and realize you're supposed to be paying attention? This happened to me multiple times during this movie. There were points where I actually forgot I was watching a film, and I'm not joking.The tag line is ""We had twenty years to prepare. So did they."" But did they? Because after watching this movie I really couldn't tell. In fact, the aliens seemed weaker. Sure, they had a few force fields, a few clever bait and switches, but is that really all they came up with after twenty years? No wonder no one in the movie seemed afraid of them. People actually seemed pretty calm, even though the aliens wiped out London and China immediately after entering the Earth's atmosphere, just by flying over them. But that doesn't seem to bother anyone. The Earth is going to end in a few minutes? Didn't seem to matter to anybody in this film, because no one showed any emotion, and anger, any sadness, any grief, any hysteria, or any fear relating to this, and because of this, there was no sense of tension or fear for the viewer either. And this throws the tone off, also. I understand that these movies are supposed to be guilty pleasure fun, but at least have the tone be a little darker and a little more serious. This film was so lighthearted that it was actually off-putting.This movie never really felt like it got started either. I mean, you get your giant CGI explosion fest when the alien ship first enters the Earth's atmosphere, with cities literally being torn out of the ground, but then the action never gets any bigger or better than that. My jaw literally dropped while watching the destruction during this scene, and I was ready for the action to intensify and grow. But it didn't. It got slower. They put the climax in the first 45 minutes of the movie, and then just spend the rest of the running time focusing on the falling action.The action was also incoherent, with a million things happening on the screen at one time. It was hard to follow and looked very generic, and while it wasn't necessarily boring, it wasn't exciting in the slightest. And the CGI wasn't even that good either; there were points where watching this movie was like watching gameplay of an off-brand science fiction video game that was released in the middle of winter to appeal to the parents of small children who have no idea that the game they're buying is a cheap knockoff of a triple A title.And speaking of CGI, the universe that was built in the film didn't seem believable at all. I didn't see an improved and more protected Earth that used futuristic alien technology to their advantage. I saw a paint bucket of CGI vomit thrown on the screen, with Roland Emmerich stuffing it down our throats while saying ""Believe it! This is reality!""I should've watched the fireworks instead.",Independence Day - Resurgence
149,pranayjalvi,A good Sequel,7,31 July 2016,"Independence Day: Resurgence doles out the action and effects work in carefully measured, incremental doses, which give the film a cumulative tension almost despite itself. Even if it's hokey and jokey, this is a loud, effects-driven piece, with a driving score. For fans of Roland Emmerich disaster movies, it both hits all the marks, while delivering nothing new. Yet in today's global marketplace, that should be enough to deliver the commercial payload. Roland Emmerich with his always delivering disaster movies (The Day After Tomorrow, 2012,White House Down) delivers another one. I would go with 3.5/5 for this good enough, not so special sequel.",Independence Day - Resurgence
150,MikesIDhasbeentaken,Didn't think it could be done!..,4,1 October 2016,"For me not not enjoy a sequel to Independence Day...But the makers of this movie have somehow managed to turn a huge blockbuster movie with aliens invading earth with giant spaceships completely boring, even to someone like me who loves this stuff even if there's no other story line.There's no tension here, surely aliens so superior and advanced invading should be tense? but they seemed to have devolved over the last 20 years, I mean they allow some 20 odd year old fighter pilot come into the ship come right outside the queen aliens little house and take a pee on their ship, and even when they send their peeps out to kill him, they all fire hundreds of shot from only a few metres away and he throws his gun at them and runs away...the Aliens are just awful, not scary just stupid. aside from that the humans are just annoying and all have too many sob stories you won't care about. They were obviously trying to go for the same cheesy script the original movie had, but completely missed the point, this isn't cheesy, it's just bad.but... it does have aliens invading earth in giant spaceships and lots of fight scenes, so not all bad.",Independence Day - Resurgence

152,FelipeCarrillo,"""Independence Day: Resurgence"" Is Even More Hollow, Superficial, Insubstantial and Infuriating",5,26 June 2016,"We are talking about a film of 1996 that stipulated the directives for the upcoming blockbusters based in the invasions of aliens created by Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin. It was the model for many of the current movies, those empty but entertaining films that are the daily bread in American films, too much CGI, combined with some comedy and drama, the perfect summer film, though, that magic has begun to agonize. ""Resurgence"" lands in the worldwide film market as a sequel in which in addition to not be present the soul of the original film, Will Smith, it is responsible for presenting a constant self-parody and not funny at all that makes it easy to find the myriad of lacks of which owns.""We Had Twenty Years to Prepare"", states the tag line at the top of the poster, but were it really twenty years?. After the catastrophic event in 1996, Earth has managed to reinvigorate its weaknesses and they have decided to unify all nations in order to preserve human life - a help for the writers, they take for granted to United States going to take the decisions – creating contraptions of high technology, such as the conception of the speed of the ships or the defiance of gravity , What premise!. ""So Did They"", one fortified attack and more resistant returns to Earth, with powerful strategies that will put at risk millions of lives, again.It's not correct to affirm that ""Resurgence"" disappoints, since at no time it promised more than excessive action - a kind of ""Star Wars"" recycled-, aliens - with notable references of the genre -, destruction of cities - ""2012"", also directed by himself - and abundant mentions of its predecessor which give the audience a tone of nostalgia.Roland Emmerich is a film director that started his career in his native country Germany, with ""Franzmann"" in 1979 and later with ""The Noah's Ark Principle"" in 1984, which was accused him of recreating American films in Germany. Roland took the decision to try to sneak into cinematic mecca of the world, and he succeeded it, opening his experienced curriculum vitae with ""Universal Soldier"" in 1992 with Jean-Claude Van Damme. He was gradually settling in major film studios with projects such as ""The High Crusade"" and ""Stargate"" both released in 1994. Acquiring knowledge, seniority and expertise in the sci-fi genre, it was in 1996 in where his greatest success was evidenced, Emmerich debuts with Will Smith ""Independence Day"". He already established as one of the directors most requested in Hollywood launches ""The Day After Tomorrow"" in 2004, ""2012"" in 2009 and a number of projects that had not too much impact, but which were of great help in the construction of a CV so honorary so disconcerting. It's in 2016 when the sequel to his project more outstanding it is released, the final collection of each of his projects and even though have not been praised by movie critics, these are loved and remembered by many viewers, especially his grand debut in the genre.Undoubtedly, special effects are the strong point. With amazing visual effects - obviously, executed by CGI and green screens - transform a boring narrative journey in a visual show ""Star Wars""- style. In one scene of the film, a spaceship arrives on Earth to pick up David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) and his team, at that time in which the ship lands, my brain generated a reaction of unreality, that is to say, I thought that the scene was completely fictitious and Utopian, but not by its sparkling effects, it was an involuntary reaction that that was not possible. Something unaware to the CGI. Space battles, imposing aliens, an exciting opening scene and much apocalyptic disaster is accomplished in its greatest splendor.A plot quite simple and poor, linear and boring with a development for nothing worthy of its predecessor, adorned with stunning visual effects that do not save it of a long and tense space travel. The yawns were unavoidable. The script is full of imperative exclamations; It has not got dramatic base nor much less to real. But the worst were the comic touches, which gradually were horrible, immature and exasperating, destroying to one of the most endearing characters of the original. The script gets all the shortcomings of American projects. The new cast is pathetic, they have no charisma, they have no chemistry, and with total humility and respect there were too many times in where I laughed. Liam H., Maika M. and Usher are some of the new crew.An unnecessary sequel is added to the list of ""Unwanted projects"" and although its effects are amazing, narrative and acting charge of its predecessor has gone to the moon. Finally, ""ID: 3 '' already has been announced and we hope that Will Smith is in this.",Independence Day - Resurgence

Now I've read quite a few reviews on here & it's reassuring that there are a great number of Reviewers giving this 3 stars & less, that alone reassures me there are still sane people around but its very unnerving to see many giving this 8s 9s & even10 stars, now I won't name the reviewer but I'd like to just share a small snippet from their review;Rule number one this kind of movies: forget about logic in the script, it is about sensation, action and special effects. You want a good story, watch drama, not this.
This person gave an 8/10, this now clears up the mystery of all these OTT scores on god awful trash movies, these reviewers are clearly devoid of not only basic common sense but also a simple understanding of logic & science fiction, heres a clue, the only thing that's not factual is the fiction, its fictional stories involving science, science is the part that's supposed to be based in fact.
This movie is without doubt the biggest waste of money in a long time.
I love action sci fi, comedy sci fi, drama sci fi but what is unforgivable is so called intelligent people completely disregarding even the most simple basic science facts, a suspension of belief to a certain degree is always expected but a total suspension of belief? Ludicrous, it also makes it impossible to find even the smallest part of excrement like this enjoyable.
While so many intelligently challenged audiences give good reviews for god awful garbage then more & more god awful garbage will be churned out.
Modern day cgi, no matter how expensive or how sensational can make up for a garbage story line or plot, Avatar is a perfect example of that & this movie is no different.",Independence Day - Resurgence

It pleases its audience and does not challenge it in the least. But it presses all the buttons it's supposed to press. The dialog is loaded with the worst clichés (""He's right behind me isn't he,"" ""In English, please"") but you can say that about many Hollywood wannabe blockbusters. The action is exciting but surprises are few and far between. The acting is serviceable from mostly forgettable performers...except Goldblum and Judd Hirsch. Good to see Bill Pullman again, but even he seemed to be just punching the clock. In spite of all these qualities, it does what it says on the tin, as they say in the UK. It's an alien invasion action movie. There will be relatively little insight into the human condition, and relatively massive amounts of CGI footage of spaceships blowing things up. If you know that going in, and just eat your popcorn and enjoy the ride without thinking too much about why the characters are doing what their doing (the characters sure don't seem to be doing that) then you should have an enjoyable if slight experience.",Independence Day - Resurgence

158,pinkarray,FYI: Independence Day: Resurgence is not a movie I would recommend you go see,4,13 July 2016,"Well, here it is, the long-awaited sequel to the movie Independence Day, my beloved movie from childhood. There are a few known actors I noticed weren't in the movie, Will Smith and Mae Whitman. Will Smith may have turned down the role for whatever reason and Mae Whitman was a pretty good actress. Not for sure why she didn't come back to play the adult President's daughter.After hearing pretty mixed reviews for this film, I decided to watch it, I mean, it couldn't be that bad, right? It could be a charming, entertaining, action-packed sequel. Instead, most of the humor in the film was the only thing that stood out in this movie. But anyway, it's pretty laughable.Those actors are gone and replaced with wooden actors who are probably better off in more melodramatic roles. This action sequel had a more dramatic tone than the first one did.This movie left a lot of questions and the charm from the first film is mostly lost. Like why would they kill off the innocent black woman in a rushed way who was supposed to be a more supporting role in the first film? I was thinking that they were going to magically bring her back, but they didn't. I was excited, wondering what the sequel would bring, and here I am, disappointed and wishing that the movie would be over.Joey King, the girl we know from Oz: The Great and Powerful and Ramona and Beezus is usually pretty charming in her roles, but more forced and wooden, is more average here. Nothing special. I wished that they could've made her make-up more prettier.Mckenna Grace was supposed to be the adorable little Daisy who does nothing important for the film as did most of the other little kids other than just being there getting scared. Also, she may have came off as a tad too cutesy.The music was overly cheerful for the movie. In some parts, the music sounded like the movie was going to be over soon but it just kept going. It seemed to have gelled with the inconsistent writing.The director seemed to have just slapped characters in there along with unimportant characters to comfort them. There was not much explanation as to why they were there.As the movie begun, I was that sitting down to this movie, hoping that it would be good for the rainy day.",Independence Day - Resurgence

Jeff Goldblum returns as the best scene stealer in the film but still the movie doesn't know what to do with him. The action sequences focuses too much on getting everything into one shot, including people, planes and sometimes aliens. This film is too noisy without there being a real explanation to it all. The overall plot is confusing as it shifts from one objective to the other. This film is packed with so much unnecessary side plots and idiot humor that this film really does come off as a want to be original film, there is no energy or charisma in this one, it does deliver some great special effects but that does not nearly make a good disaster film. It's fun seeing some of the original cast back but there's too much going on that the film shoves them aside, and let's other new characters shine that are really dull,and useless. I won't even mention the on the nose ending to set up for future sequels.

But will mankind's new space defenses be enough? Independence Day: Resurgence is directed by Roland Emmerich as the first one was. In fact, this second instalment is pretty much just like the first one in every way, except for a few things that the first film had: energy and charisma. This sequel has none of the above. There's so many characters, some who give the old cast relevance and some who give the new cast relevance. This whole thing feels pretty awkward. In total honesty and with all due respect to Maika Monroe, they really should have kept Mae Whitman in the President's daughter role. She's a fantastic actress, though yes, she's not a sports illustrated supermodel - but still super talented. She really should have been in this movie. Nonetheless, Jeff Goldblum is by far the best part of this movie. His character is still entertaining, he's fun and it seems that he's genuinely having a great time! I loved seeing him back and someone has to put him in Jurassic World 2 - please! Finally, I really wanted to like this one but unfortunately, it tried to be a lot more than just blind entertainment and it failed.

163,lediscipledessocrates,Spoof of the Decade,1,10 August 2016,"I was in grade 5 when Independence Day (I) was released. At that time I felt it was a very entertaining movie . Of course one could discount this impression given my young age, but I wish to state that even when I watched the very same movie five years later , I could not find much fault with my previously stated opinion regarding the quality of the movie.In all fairness, if The Fast and The Furious can have can afford eight installments, Independence Day surely deserved at least one sequel ( or may be even a prequel given the latest fad for drawing up fantastically complicated backgrounds posthumously for otherwise quite simple plot lines) . And yes, after a long 20 years, the D-day arrived when the second installment in the franchise was released. But by Jove , what a disaster this movie has turned out to be. Consistently abrupt, with a childish story-line ( a new low for Alien based cinema) , laughable characters, highly unoriginal dialogue , atrocious screenplay and outrageously bad acting , ID II is undoubtedly a classic spoof on the original movie. The sequences range from the highly boring, to the laughably ridiculous war room patriotic rhetoric. As though thing were't sad enough, the director pushed through irritating scenes of half-cooked male bonding. The editing is amateurish . There are scenes where characters stomp off and the scene cuts off to the next take very abruptly . Of course for those averse to silly pre-disaster emotional conversations between lead actors, this is a source of joy ( I am one of them) . It is true that ID I was a not a star studded venture, but somehow , if we discount for the fact the movie was made in the 90's ( how I love that decade) , the acting wasn't too bad and each actor played put his part.Here, of course matters are a lot different. Things get so cheesy at one point of time when a character says to another "" You have a warrior's heart"" . To show how stereotypical the casting is one need not probe too deeply. We have a crazy scientist , a gung-ho President, who doesn't even pretend to spend 5 seconds on a decision. Pally fighter pilots and of course the adorable aliens , who must be wondering why things ended up the way it did. We also have a dog waiting to be rescued , before war dust storms kill it. In the entire history of popular cinema, never have the characters been so dispensable .The American President in the movie is a case in point. Firstly, she is the most decisive President the world has ever seen, who authorises nuclear strikes in a jiffy. A leader who very easily ( in a matter of not more than 3 seconds) authorises three pilots to incinerate themselves in a suicide attack. It will not be wrong to say that sequel cracked under the shadow of ID I. The story line is very weak and the movie in short is very boring.",Independence Day - Resurgence
164,SpoilerAlertReviews,"Just Larger, Sillier than the first.",3,25 June 2016,"Roland Emmerich returns for his first sequel with pretty much the same team that brought us the first invasion with Dean Devlin again writing the script for this sequel, which he original threw in the bin shortly after the success of the first. Well, I can't imagine how bad that script was to be binned if this was the winning formula. Susan Sarandon turned it down because it was uninteresting and didn't make sense. I think there was a lot of over excitement from the film makers on this one that isn't appreciated by many. Very much like the first it's super clichéd but the first was forgivable with this one being annoying and defies all probable outcomes. We have more chance of aliens attacking Earth than bumping into your Dad, driving a school bus across the salt plains after your recent trip to the moon and back. There's plenty of plot-holes and things that just don't make sense. It's out of scale in both size and time. There's blatant inconsistencies which makes me think they rushed it, carelessly. Bill Pullman's president goes from being a crippling wreck with walking stick to being clean shaven and walking bolt upright. Their attempt to cleverly twist the story was so poor and silly lending to an inevitable trilogy. Again, it all happens so quickly, and what is that thing? Possibly designed to look like an Apple product? Wall-E already done that. It's rushed and hashed together losing the dramatic awe of the first film. It lacks the impressive action and the dogfights feel more like a messy rework of eighties video-games. I seriously have seen better fights from dated cartoons than in this. There's really nothing to shout about this, nothing we haven't seen before. People die, key people die but no-one really cares, there's absolutely no emotional investment where there's suppose to be. The sets feel cheap, and might have something to do with the U.S. Military retracting their assistant of allowing them to film on bases. And you might expect more from CGI powerhouse Emmerich, but it's just not believable. Not all of the FX are bad, but I'm surprised how little devastation a mothership did, especially being the size of the Atlantic Ocean. Yes, it picks up one city and drops it on another, but that's it. I'm pretty sure I saw the matrix coding on one of their consoles. Five of the original cast return, namely Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman and Star Trek's Data, David Spiner. Liam Hemsworth heads up being a pilot hot shot and feels like he should be Top Gun II. Emmerich's regular, Harald Kloser takes over from David Arnold for the score and it lacks a recognised theme and soon gets lost among the action scenes. It's not bad because they killed off Will Smith's character without any explanation. May have been a better twist having Liam Hemsworth character being the cause of his death instead of wing clipping the step-son. It's just bad, tasteless and dumb. The real reason for the death of Captain Hiller is the $50 million price tag that came attached to the high flyer. It's just larger and sillier, not as good as the first but, kids of today might just love it and talk about this one for years. Especially for when we take the fight to them! Overall it's very weak and a poor show from someone who likes to blow landmarks up, only thing blown up was the size of things. What is good to come from this is that I have been inspired to write a blog on alien invasions. Watch this 'space' for more.

165,comps-784-38265,Independence Day - Glib Ersatz reboot failure.,5,4 July 2016,"I very much liked the predecessor, 'Independance Day' - a corny alien invasion sci-fi romp where America saves the world (again) and finally mankind wins against all odds. So I was eager to see the sequel.But Independence Day Resurgence has the all too common mistakes of sequels. Instead of making an exciting sequel with new plot (ok I know it's still basically alien invasion) but new characters, new ideas - originality!.Instead the makers 'Play safe' trying to mimic the original (successful) film. They fail because it is in many respects an ersatz 'reboot' with new weapons and much weaker storyline. Jeff Goldbloom is still the nice but rather puzzled genius as previous. His father as per previous Will Smiths character is dead but his pilot son is here, as previous. There is another pilot friend (as previous) who is competing with new will smith. Dr Hokum has been preserved in a coma and awakes to immediately resume his role as previous. President whitmore is no longer president but is still there as previous. However he takes over the 'suicide' pilot role (as previous)Will smiths wife is still there, curiously the go go dancer is now a doctor? They have thrown in a 'friendly' alien robot (who reminded me of brian from confused.com) but it was just came across as a glib idea to beat the bad aliens.In trying to replicate too much of the original film and original characters, the new characters are undeveloped and trivial. In the original film you were absorbed, could David Levinson (Goldblum) save the world ? Would the fighters get through? etcThe plot is so unoriginal, characters or new characters so remarkably close to the original, it was trite and rather boring. Disappointing watch once only !!! - 5/10",Independence Day - Resurgence
166,rutzelb,Basically a Video Game,3,22 October 2016,"After 20 years of the first alien invasion known to us as Independence Day, the aliens are back. Oh, oh. The only way out of this destruction is to kill the alien Queen. How will that be done?This version of Independence Day is nothing more than a Video Game with battles lasting most of the movie. There is some acting and planning to fight the aliens, but this is mostly a CGI show, which is, of course, spectacular but when it seems to go on forever we get tired, bored and can't wait for this to be over. There was a tendency to put too much into this movie and we were pulled in many different directions. The acting sequences didn't last long enough for anyone to shine so we can forget about any Oscar-worthy performances. Comic relief supposedly came in from Judd Hirsch, who as Julius Levinson wrote a book that claims he saved Earth the first time (the first Independence Day). It is safe to say there was no Comic Relief in here and Hirsch's performance was annoying, not funny. The cause of the fight between Jake (Hemswoth) and Capt Hiller (Jessie T. Usher) - Will Smith's son from the 1st Independence day – was not clear and, of course, we knew they would become BFFs again in time, but did we care? Of course not.For a CGI movie the only performances of note came from Jeff Goldblum as David Levinson who we are not sure what his significance was in here but he did good, whatever it was. He's a good actor. Bill Pullman as the former president, Thomas Whitmore, and he should have been given more screen time as we learned more from him than the rest of the cast and he was the only one we cared about. Notables in for the payday: Brent Spiner as Dr. Brakish Okun; Robert Loggia as General Gray; Sela Ward as President Langford; William Fichtner as General Adams and later as President; Deobia Oparei as Warlord Umbutu; and Maika Monroe as Patricia Whitmore and Jake's love interest. The friendly sphere the main characters talked with told of its training of other planets to fight these aliens, but it was the Americans that came up a plan to actually kill the Queen. The plan was a simple one and why didn't the sphere come up with that plan on its own since it was supposed to be so intelligent? Huh?Again, this was a CGI show all the way. Let's hope there is no Independence Day 3. Wait. Wait. The sphere held many secrets of how to build alien weapons so maybe there will be an Independence Day 3. Woe is us. (3/10)Violence: Yes.

167,mattfrancis-03963,That disappointing I nearly cried.,3,15 May 2021,"Alright the film lacked the presence of Will Smith who certainly recognised early on this film wouldn't do well but they could still have made this a lot better. This was suppose to be the sequel to one of the greatest blockbusters of all time, instead, throw in a pretty face and a few pilots with no logic, plus some really awful edited city and a few too many of nothing going on, and well, this fell so flat. Considering this was meant to be good they just rushed through adding too many special effects and not enough drama. I was so excited when this was announced then a few weeks later it had a release date so I knew it wouldn't be any good. Just so bitterly disappointed.",Independence Day - Resurgence

169,destinylives52,Eh,6,14 August 2016,"It should be called ""Independence Day: Regurgitation."" The same director; the same logical flaws; the same unfunny jokes; the same main actors; the same aliensI'd be okay with the same of many things except all the logical flaws of the story. Okay, first the plot: it's been 20 years since the original invasion, and humans have merged alien tech with human tech, and we now have super duper military hardware. People think they have what it takes to defend against another attack, but they are mistaken. From the aliens' home world comes a ship that is 3,000 miles wide, ready to destroy us pesky humans. But the aliens didn't count on one thing: a screenplay so full of plot holes that the aliens are sure to be defeated in the most stupid and ridiculous ways. ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" is just one big shenanigan of a movie. For example: the mother ship, at 3,000 miles wide, has its own gravitational pull. It destroys anything that it flies oversowhy not just do a fly-by over the entire surface of Earth and wipe out the humans? Hey, don't look at meask the 5 screenwriters — which includes the director — whose combined talent (or lack thereof) couldn't see that most of this movie made no sense. I have to admit though: ""ID: R"" was somewhat amusing. Not exactly a glowing recommendation for a $165 million dollar project (plus the cost of distribution). My most memorable, movie moment of ""ID: R"" would be the final seconds of the movie when it is clear Roland Emmerich is thinking about another ""ID"" movie. If there is anyone deserving of a painful, alien, anal probe, it is Emmerich.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments",Independence Day - Resurgence
170,caseynicholson,Way Better Than the Reviews,9,5 July 2016,"I had never seen the original ""Independence Day"" until this sequel spurred me to watch it yesterday on July 4th, 2016. I found the original to be fine for a 1996 film, but pretty cheesy by today's standards. I wasn't hugely impressed and gave it a score of 6/10 on here. And with the sequel, ""Resurgence"", getting terrible reviews, I was tempted not to even go see the sequel, despite its being what made me decide to watch the original.Having now seen the sequel, I thought it was fantastic! So fantastic that I can't help but wonder if I saw the same movie as the one that is getting so widely panned by the critics. I got an hour into it and loved it, and I kept thinking, okay, maybe it falls apart in hour two, as movies sometimes do (Transformers 4 comes to mind).But to my surprise, the movie just got better and better. I found very little to not like about this movie, and I very firmly feel that it's a huge improvement over the original. That said, I'm giving it a 9/10, and that's a score that I don't give to very many movies. I honestly can't fathom why this wasn't a much larger hit than it's turned out to be this summer. If you liked the original, you should love this movie!",Independence Day - Resurgence
171,palavitsinis,Will Smith would have changed everything,5,24 October 2016,"I don't know. Six seems like a lot, five seems a little low, but it's closer to five for me. Although the first one was really really awesome, this one just fails to deliver. It's a nicely made movie that kind of stepped into the previous one, but in some weird way, it does not excite nor thrill. I would have loved Will Smith in it. I would also have loved if they could take some more time to ease us into the movie, explain a couple of things first, make a better connection with the previous one. It seemed like the movie was rushing itself to get to the part with the aliens once more. The way they were defeated in the end was too similar with the previous one if you ask me, as was the overall story. I would expect something more. I would also expect less Sci-Fi. I mean, even 20 years after the first attack, the planet could not have changed as drastically and dramatically as the one in the movie. It was all too much. Too many characters also, not nicely depicted, which was more confusing for the viewer than it was exciting. In the end, I am thinking that whereas the first one was a pioneering movie for its time, being one of the first movies that depicted such a clash with aliens in such a nicely done way, this one comes at a time when this concept has been done a thousand times, failing to provide something different or worth mentioning. It's a pity",Independence Day - Resurgence
172,autisticreviewers,Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,4,27 June 2016,"This movie follows the first one really well. 20 years later every character got on with their lives ever since the destruction of the aliens in 1996. Now they have returned and with a much, bigger ship! Words alone cannot describe to all of you reading this how corny and cheesy this film was. It goes beyond cheesiness. Every character from the first one returns and have psychological problems, haven't moved on or are living in misery since the last attack. The effects are somewhat decent. But the writing...Good God! I can now understand why Will Smith did not even want to be in this movie. This sequel just wasn't needed.There a few good action sequences, such as the final battle with The Alien Queen, but it wasn't really enough to overlook all the other problems this film had. The Autistic Reviewers give this 1.5/5 stars, 4/10.",Independence Day - Resurgence
173,afijamesy2k,ID4 Resurgence should have never been resurged from the beginning.,2,13 July 2016,"Now back in 1996 the first independence day movie was the best film of 1996 and one of my all time favorite science fiction movies, something I haven't seen since the original star wars trilogy, but this sequel of this great film, you can just forget about it, because this thing is a pain in the ass, this idiotic lame brained sequel is so bad it makes the transformers sequels seem nice, thankfully will smith was smart to leave the film just like Roy scheider was smart to leave the jaws franchise after Jaws 2, Aliens attack major cities again and the humans have to fight back to save the world not much else, bill Pullman and the rest of the cast are truly wasted in this one, the story is pathetic, the screen party is ridiculous and the writing is poorly, the only good thing about this whole terrible picture is the great CGI effects, that's about it, this is a really boring and hapless piece of garbage that should have never been released.one of the years worst films.

174,iamtherobotman,Yee Haar!! USA to the rescue again,1,29 July 2016,"For me, the original Film was laughably bad. This one takes us to a whole new level of laughable. The Yanks like to portray themselves as the Heroes of the Galaxy but on this occasion they really did go 'full retard', from the US President deciding to attack a spaceship on behalf of all Mankind to so many characters ready to play the Martyr in order to save all humanity. The story....correction, there was no story, merely a load of random scenes stuck together to give the impression of a story.This is without question one of the worst pieces of 'USA is great' propaganda pieces of rubbish i have ever seen.Oh, apparently this was better than the original concept for a sequel...Makes you wonder just how brutally bad that was, if this was the one which was filmed.",Independence Day - Resurgence
175,lois-lane33,A truly ho-hum science fiction effort at best.,5,2 August 2016,"I saw this film earlier in the summer and it made such an impression on me that I cannot even remember how they finally defeated the alien invaders. I thought the first film was kind of a modern classic in a way-but this sequel was only a bigger, louder more video game like romp which offered scientifically implausible alien vehicles dropping on Earth. The alien vessels were so huge they would have probably altered the rotation of the Earth after they had landed- resulting in a terminal ecological disaster. I think the folk who make SF films these days think that all they have to do is fill the skies with space ships and then 'abracadabra' they have a hit movie. I think I started to fall asleep during this movie several times. It barely works visually on the big screen-so its sure to fail visually on the small one. Yawn.",Independence Day - Resurgence
176,danielharden,The bigger they are the harder they fall,4,8 July 2016,"20 years after the exclusively American blockbuster classic that is Indepenence Day, America finally gets the sequel they have been waiting for... Too bad its in the form of Independence Day: Resurgence. This decades later sequel thinks that bigger is better but actually tries so hard to be bigger its as if it forgot the latter part of the saying along the way.To start on a positive note, the visual effects are pretty damn good and extremely satisfying to the eye. Most likely one of the major reasons this sequel was made now the sfx never look fake or out of place for a film about alien world destruction. So for those you enjoy the spectacle of the big screen and to be mesmerised by whats put in front of you, then this is the film for you.Now that I've said whats good about this film, its time to address the many flaws of this feature. Let's start with acting shall we? Well its more like reacting than acting, especially from Jeff Goldblum, but then again that's what blockbuster movie acting is. Unable to get the original movies star, this film seems to rely on any original cast members they can get their hands on. Sure the film got Jeff Goldblum and Bill Pullman from its original cast but it also brings in Dr Brackish Okun as a sort of main character that I don't know if anyone remembers from the original. The film even stoops so low as to give unimportant characters pointless side story like Julies Levison and those orphaned(?) kids.The film also brings in the all grown up now children from the original as its leads. Maika Monroe and Jessie T. Usher play grown up Patricia Whitmore and Dylan Hiller in an attempt to pass the torch to the next generation of movie goers. Maika Monroe does a bit of crying here and there but as a whole the acting, as well as the movie, fail to bring much emotion and characters that you actually care about. Not only are their characters that you don't care for, there are also many characters that simply do nothing or have no purpose for being in this film. From David Levisions love interest to the orphaned(?) kids to the wimpy journalist guy to Liam Hemsworths friend as his love interest. Even Julies Levison is back and more of a Jewish stereotype than ever. I simply have no idea why he's in these films.In all fairness I thought the story for the most part was OK. Not good or bad just watchable, but then nearer the end the film delves into dumb action movie territory and leaves several questions unanswered like; What was the symbol because the horizontal line wasn't the same as the sphere alien? How does everyone know where Area 51 is? Why did President Whitmore, Dr Okun and Dikembe Umbutu (the duel machete guy) have those stinging headache things and what were those?SPOILER ALERT: The ending was so cheesy you might as well bring some crackers. Aliens are defeated, Goldblum gets the girl, Monroe and Hemsworth can get married, Hemsworth and Usher make up, Hemsworths friend got a date with the Chinese pilot, Journalist guy earns machete guys respect and Julies Levison takes the orphans home with him without any alarm bells ringing. Not only is everything swell but a sequel is set up acting as the cherry on the top of this sh*t sundae. Everyone maybe jumping for joy that the world is saved but need I remind you that the Burj Tower in Dubai crashed into the London Eye... Somebody has gone to the Man of Steel school of how to save the world.Overall Independence day: Resurgence is a beautiful looking sh*t show. The series is similar to the Fast and Furious franchise due to its it-is-what-it-is quality. I think now its time for this series to go quietly into the night.",Independence Day - Resurgence
177,ghcheese,A little cheesy but A good watch,9,24 June 2017,Is it as great as the first one. No. But that is a high standard. I thought this was a good watch. If you compare it with a lot of scifi movies that make now a days this was really good. But I feel most are comparing it to the first Independence Day. And that was one of the great movie.

178,Fudge-3,Not put off by harsh reviews,8,4 July 2016,"I did see the original when it came out at the cinema. It was a really good 9/10 and still stands up very well today. I recall the director saying, 'we make bubble gum movies,' that it is and that is in no way a bad thing.The remake more or less follows the same pattern as the first with only slightly less success. This drops the movie to an 8/10 and the fault (which is really nit picking) is with Jessie Usher and Liam Hemsworth who can't carry his scenes with the same charisma as Will Smith but then there aren't many who could. Maybe Chris Pratt (Guardians of the Galaxy) could have pulled it off better.I smiled a lot, I laughed a few times and I was thrilled as the ending unfolded.Jeff Goldblum does carry the movie more or less on his own but he has big shoulders.I can see the criticisms but mostly do not agree.The CGI is very good with the exceptions of the overlays at the end of the movie. The characters are so pasted on a green screen that I was sure I could see the glue but the movie is already over at this point.There are more character threads than the plot needs and one of them does loose its way but only at the end. The guys in the 'salvage ship' thread were great.The tension doesn't build like it did in the first. I see this as more a difference in pace, the pauses are shorter between each disaster. Too much action and not enough plot development or characterisation? Maybe a bit.It's not for the intelligent viewer - yep, it's a bubble gum movie.Nothing is explained - well, it is if you actually watch it and you are intelligent.",Independence Day - Resurgence

An over done/ over exploited genre of saving the world movie. Completely disappointing and demeaning the first part. Over used graphics and so much cliché yet without proper clarity. It was a PlayStation in the big screen. It looked like they wanted to make a a powerful comeback franchise after two decades but ended up spoiling it with shallow screen play, void loop holes like the African place and people warring against the alien force and so many facts here and there was left unexplained. The fact is I couldn't treat is as a comedy also. What so ever not ready for another franchise in the coming years. Demeans the first part.-Sivakumar Balachandran",Independence Day - Resurgence
181,barbagvido,"Cringe, cringe, cringe...",1,29 June 2016,"Independence Day:Resurgence is a long awaited sequel to a classic blockbuster Independence Day which was pretty solid, by the way. I remember reading news about this movie finally going forward and it actually seemed pretty nice. I just came home from seeing it and I still can't believe what I saw. Honestly, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.CGI is pretty good, but it seems to be the only thing they focused on. That's pretty much the only redeeming quality of this movie. The dialogues are so cringe-worthy I laughed a few times just because it was so hilariously bad. The acting isn't much better either and the characters are so uninteresting. There was almost no characterization in the first movie either, but at least they were charismatic. Here they are just so uninteresting and you really don't care about them. Not just the characters, you don't care about the plot at all. You just watch stuff happen your eyes and you just don't give a damn. And you know how after you see some movies you already forget a half of them. Here you forget stuff while you're watching. That's how uninteresting it is. And it's also pretty unrealistic. Seriously, why would people be cracking jokes in such situations. It's okay if it's one character, but when it's almost all characters then it just comes across as cheesy. And there are plenty of clichés, trust me, this is like every other movie directed by Roland Emmerich. They are all the same, there is just a different catastrophe. Transformers look like an Oscar-worthy masterpiece compared to this! Just wow! That's actually pretty hard to achieve, so congratulations. God, this is terrible.You can go see it for yourself if you want to, I can't stop you. If it looks good judging by the trailers (it looked good to me), believe me, it's not. It's not even worth seeing in cinema for the effects. I still can't believe how bad this was. Wow, that's all I can say. Wow.",Independence Day - Resurgence
182,Minus_The_Beer,It's The End Of The Franchise As We Know It (And I Feel Fine),4,8 April 2017,"Released in the summer of 1996, ""Independence Day"" benefited a great deal from a lack of competition. It helped that the big-budget alien invasion flick boasted a great cast and even greater special effects. Its many plot-holes and inconsistencies were easy to forgive in the face of the pure eye-candy and unadulterated sci-fi action at hand. Fast forward 20 years later. We're all a little older, but maybe none the wiser. Likewise for the characters in the film and the creators behind what is now being loosely called a franchise. ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" attempts to bring back the glory days of the '90s when disaster flicks ruled the realm. It's a return to a dumb but fun style of cinema (emphasis on the dumb). Gee, while we're at it, can we get a ""Deeper Impact"" and maybe a ""Return to Dante's Peak"" while we're at it?Director Roland Emmerich clearly has eyes bigger than his stomach. The destruction is bigger and badder this time around, but it just ends up looking like a SyFy original movie on steroids. A yawn- inducing over-saturation of just barely passable CGI, the mayhem that ensues carries virtually no weight. Even less impressive are the film's antagonists, given more screen-time here than in the original. The film culminates in a final showdown between the Queen alien and the human resistance in broad daylight that, quite frankly, looks sloppy even by 1996 standards. Like ""Jurassic World"" a few years back, it's shocking how the special effects in these sort of big-budget blockbusters is regressing to the point where the older clearly looks better, even to unbiased eyes. Whereas the first film wisely stuck to practical effects with the alien creatures and used them sparingly, the sequel tries to James Cameron the heck out of them, but feels less like ""Aliens"" than it does ""Piranha II: The Spawning"" in its execution. The new characters that are meant to serve as the centerpiece of the story are as lacking in charisma as the script they are following is lacking in logic. Liam ""Lesser"" Hemsworth sure looks good but offers virtually nothing of interest below the surface. Likewise, Jessie Usher -- playing Will Smith's character's orphaned son -- is so bland in his delivery and so under-written, he might as well have been excised from the film's already overly bloated cast entirely. Most of the ensemble cast from the original return (hey look, it's Robert Loggia!), with those who couldn't be bothered or bought being hand-waved away with minimal explanation. Jeff Goldblum shows up to give the film just enough credibility in a performance that can only be described as Jeff Goldblumian. Bill Pullman, meanwhile, brings back ex-president Whitmore as a psychologically scarred headcase. Pullman's arc hints at one of the film's few interesting elements, but the character is quickly side-lined and essentially relegated to Randy Quaid status. Probably the brightest spot then would be Brent Spiner's reprisal of the Dr. Okun character. Presumed dead following the events of the first film, Okun springs to life to drill ample amounts of b-grade flair into the proceedings, just enough to keep the audience from nodding off completely.To their credit, Emmerich and his writing/producing partner, Dean Devlin, do a a pretty OK job of stuffing the film with new ideas and concepts that, unfortunately, don't quite gel. There's the typical world-building that has come to be expected from any summer blockbuster, but no connection whatsoever to the real world. The film takes place in an alternate version of 2016 where a woman is president (salt, meet wound) and, presumably, 9/11 never happened. In this re-imagined world, we have advanced light-years ahead of where we currently sit, technology-wise. Meanwhile, the Earth is unified, with warring nations having finally put aside their ""petty differences"" (hey, these are the film's words, not mine). It's fun to imagine, sure, but in today's toxic environment, its less assuring and more insulting. Likewise, ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" is a barely redeemable assault on the senses will ultimately leave you feeling short-changed and all the dumber having sat through it. But hey, blue laser beams destroying stuff! Pew pew pew! Go America, GO!",Independence Day - Resurgence
183,stonedraim,They should have let the first one have been the only one. Resurgence of the low rate sequel; indeed.,4,30 July 2016,"**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.Two minutes into this one and my ""low-rate-and-maybe-approved-movie- alarm"" starts to make some noise.Do you hug somebody like when you are private at a party or something, when you are in the army and in the residence of the president and the president is in the room? No. That is a sign of missed social pattern in this one. - You are three people in a car. That means that you have by all means seen the people gotten into the car, especially as you're on a mission for the government in Africa, and riding in a convoy of cars. Then you turn around and ask the person in the back seat; ""Sorry... who were you again?"" and the person responses in a serious way.... What!? - And...here we go again.... everybody's name is... Jake and Jack. - You take a big fist right into your face. You rise up and walk away like you just had a great ice cream... like James Bond in the 70's and 80's..... and in ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" of 2016. Come on...come on, come on! (see 17 minutes into this one). Jake Morrison (Liam Hemsworth) take a solid swing from Dylan Hiller (Jessie T. Usher) If I would take a solid punch in my face, I would bleed heavily and get big bruises right away. I think they were meant to create ""Man Of Steel 2"" with Chris Hemsworth, read the wrong script and took the wrong actor, ending up with Liam Hemsworth and ""Independence Day : Resurgence"". - The world has come together once upon a time 20 years ago and defeated a devastated threat of the human race. The world reunited and built the society up again. All the knowledge, all the experience, all the analyzes gathered to be better. And, therefore... instead of trying to speak and analyze with something making its presence once again, you decide as the president with the line ""Commander, take 'em out!"" in a couple of minutes to just shoot it down. Yes, I was sarcastic about that one. (see about 24 minutes into the film) - In the moment of truth, in the moment of destruction, in the moment of survival, in the moment of the deepest fear of 'em all... a man been through it before is mentally burdened of the previous attack. He goes through the corridor with bags of drip behind him. Then the camera moves to his rear end and he scratches his behind. What!? You build a momentum, and then you tear it down effectively with misplaced parody, that is only intended to be a serious joke for the viewer. Wrong place, wrong time... wrong everything?You take a bag...a big bag.... no.... a whole shipping container XL size and stuff in all clichés you can find so you have to weld the edges together; the acting, the story, the dialogue, the over-explicit music, the...oh... I get bored just by getting bored.... Then you open it up and all you can see is the perfect jigsaw puzzle of.... ""Independence Day:Resurgence""Let's see if Bill can Pull(man) this off... oh... oh... if the pun was intended?? Maybe it is time for the gold to bloom for Jeff....what?! Another pun? Mr. Pullman och Mr. Goldblum is doing a great job fighting for a bad director and almost a throughout bad production.One-liner of the movie: Jake: Did you pee your pants? David: Uh... yeeah!? Jake: Me too.One thing that it probably only will be me thinking is innovative and a good thing for the story and the movie; the Alien Queen comes loose and goes on a berserk rage. That moment were worth watching.They (movie makers of today) are taking that remake and update for the youths generation too far. X-Men, Independence Day....please do fill the list yourself, thank You.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : An overexplicit production. Great visuals and great sound effects. - The actors : The experienced ones (such as Bill Pullman and Jeff Goldblum) makes it worth watching. Otherwise; they can do so much better. - Entertainment : Just wanted to see how cliché this was. And the radar for the cliché were gathering very much information. - Age : 114,4 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 5 Approved. 4 Failed. Lacking in character.)",Independence Day - Resurgence

187,gerry_barnaby,Awesome sequel with a brilliant well timed twist,10,23 June 2016,"likes : A lot of people were worried that this film would fail because will smith isn't in this film but I'm glad to say they didn't really need him after all as this film was awesome with some unexpected surprises that throw me for six as i was expecting it.Without giving away to much the only thing i can say is earth is no alone in this fight against the aliens, this is what throw me for six as i was not expecting this to happen , the trailer cleverly hide it from the trailer which is a good thing because it made the film so much better & more interesting. I seriously can't wait for the third film, your understand what i mean when you watch this film.All I've seen is miserable people review this film given it poor review i think these people are a waste of space just like the Hollywood critics always putting a film down, seriously do not listen to this people this film is fantastic & worth checking out.The film story its self is similar to the first film only this time it the hive queen omg the ship is almost 3rd's of the earth in size with a massive feet of fighters , the C.G.I is brilliant done special the design of the queen. Incredible work on the design of her show a much large alien size queen sign i feel they have take inspiration from the aliens film queen is design , special the new ship which look like a armada feet, with the unlike Allie this film is brilliantly done for a sequel.Liam Hemsworth & Jessie T. Usher play the heroic guys in the film done a brilliant job at it as well, although Liam had a funny moment that i did laugh at not quite as funny as the first film with will smith & Jeff Goldblum moment but still funny. Bill Pullman returning as the ex president done a pretty good job as well show that his flying day weren't past him with his character, Brent Spiner return still play the nutty scientist , Deobia Oparei was a bad ass with his character no fear true warrior character playing a son war lord who fought against the aliens the first time.Angelababy played a pretty bad ass fighter pilot for the Chinese feet , great performance. Jeff Goldblum performance is brilliant as always returning as David Levinson who is now a advisory for the earth defence, he got a bit more action in this film which was good to see , Maika Monroe played the president daughter pretty well you will remember from the first film she was younger little girl now grow up for this film, Maika played this role perfect.What i special love is the story twist that branch this film to a third film which looks to be a great concept , hopeful we wont have to wait for another 20 years to see a 3rd film come out because this was just outstanding for a sequel. Brilliant continuity with the first film showing 20 years later, although it taken 20 years for this sequel to happen, it just a brilliant film.The combat scene are awesome specially with the queen & Ariel combat scenes are brilliant done , although this film was good there were a few moment it didn't have the same impact as the first film but still one hell of a awesome film.Dislikes : One thing that did kind of fall flat was the inspirational speech's in this film well one of them anyway from the character Dylan Hiller it didn't quite have the impact inspirational speech that President Whitmore done to get you pumped for the fight to get you to say come on , bring on type of way which was a same, but i think that was a script writer fault here. This is the only problem i really saw in the film.",Independence Day - Resurgence

The script really does not much sense and majority of scenes are a blatant rip off from the first film, as much as its nice to see some familiar faces from the first film it is still very disappointing.I think its safe to say will smith is probably glad negotiations brokedown for him to reprise his role as not evan his star power could salvage this high budget film that would look at home on the syfy channel.Don't waste your money in theatre's wait a few months and you can pick this up in a bargain basket at your local walmart",Independence Day - Resurgence
189,nahumthebest,Ridiculously disappointing waste of 2 hours,2,2 July 2016,"This film is the worst film I've seen in awhile. When it comes to movies, TV shows, and acting, I am very critical.The #1 worse thing about this movie is the story and screenplay. It was simply terribly written and rushed and crammed into exactly 100 minutes.The #2 worse thing about this movie was the acting, particularly of Liam Hemsworth; his acting looked fake and not believable at all.The #3 worse thing about this movie was the director, the screenwriters, and the storywriters, and the actors.Acting: Jeff Goldblum - excellent acting, as expected of him, just like in the original film. Judd Hirsch - excellent acting, as expected, just like in the original film. Brent Spiner - great acting, just like in the original film. William Fichtner - good acting, but not excellent like I'd expect from him. Jessie Usher - decent acting. Debbie Oparei - great acting.Liam Hemsworth - horrendous acting on this film. His acting felt and looked fake, scripted, and non- believable. Bill Pullman - terrible atrocious acting; what happened to his voice? It sounded terrible. In the 1996 film his acting was great, but in this 2016 film it was really bad.Was there anything good about the film? 1) The arrival of the aliens was really exciting. So much power, fear, and destruction. Loved it. 2) The very end of the final battle was cool. 3) Overall, the invasion felt real; it didn't feel fake like those low-budget SyFy films.What was so bad about the storyline and how does it compare to the original 1996 film? 1) How humans dealt with the aliens. 2) How the final boss was defeated did not make any sense. Any smart person watching the final battle would ask the same question. 3) The film (without the credits) was exactly 1hr 40 minutes or 100 minutes long. Everything was rushed in this movie - the introduction, the problem, the solution, everything! The original 1996 film was exactly 2hrs 15 mins or 135 minutes. This 2016 film's story felt very rushed while the original one had an excellent pace due to its longer runtime. If this 2016 film had been as long, it would have been a lot better. Very disappointed. 4) The jokes in the film were not funny at all, primarily because of the terrible acting. 5) There were around four scenes on this 2016 film that resembled the original 1996 film. I don't know why they did that, but they were inferior to the original. 6) The orchestra music playing in the background during battles was just so forced and scripted. That music was unnecessary.The people below are responsible for this terrible film: Director Roland Emmerich did a terrible job here. Screenwriters: Roland Emmerich, Dean Devlin, Nicolas Wright, James A. Woods, James Vanderbilt. Story writers: Roland Emmerich, Dean Devlin, Nicolas Wright, James A.

Lots of battles.The aliens were as vicious as they were ugly this time around. More Dr. Okun. I missed Will Smith but the 5 young characters together made up for his absence after 20 minutes in. No Michael Bay's treatment of women--Hot and unnecessary.Major Downsides: the length. I didn't fall asleep due to wanting to see Dr. Okun and the special effects but a couple of times I was tempted.

191,Endless_01,"Totally bad and disastrous, a sad sequel.",3,20 June 2019,"While many people consider the original Independence Day movie an entertaining one, a fantastic special effects milestone with an excellent diverse cast that delivers a great UFO action movie. Resurgence is just the opposite.No soul, no passion, no spirit; a failed attempt to follow the genius of the first that plummets down more and more. The cast is disastrous, the actors don't even seem to enjoy what they do, something surprising from Jeff Goldblum (although well, he acts as he pleases and that's his brand). With a miserable direction and lack of intense scenes, it seems more like a movie made by fans with no cinema experience, just trying to satisfy their fan-service needs.It's a completely forgettable movie, maybe the only thing that can be rescued are the special effects, which are better in other movies. After that, I really can't think of anything really exciting about this movie, it's not even that entertaining, it's a dirty and stupid movie that really only works for those moments when we turn off our neurons and decide to lie down on the bed or the sofa. Bad, that simple.",Independence Day - Resurgence
192,Harhaluulo54,"Don't listen to those ""I am too smart and too old for this"" complains.",5,17 October 2016,"There seems to be a general boom to call this a kids/teens movie which is an insult to individuals intelligence. Once again these comments suffer from tremendous double standards which only stand a legit reasoning with this case, but the same logic does not carry to other titles which the said individual watched and - for some reason - liked.In terms of maturity, this is a general PG-13 movie which follows the simplicity of one in terms of story writing, characterization and visual execution. In terms of smart, this is on parallel with superhero stories, childish space tales such as Interstellar and classic ""horror"" movies such as The Shining. Only a person with very low standards on smart could see a difference between the overall intelligence of these movies, so clearly an intelligence is not the issue either.Maybe the reason is 'membe I 'membe franchise reboots. This movie didn't have to exist. Not that its prequel was any better or had any more right to be made. One thing we see here too often are the bad self-made memes and forced comedic reliefs that serve no purpose and surely won't make anyone smile. Overall - This film has very mild take on everything. It has little to nothing to offer. You will not have a lasting impression of any sort. It goes beyond me how anyone can have such negative feelings towards a movie which couldn't get any kind of emotions out of me. Last time I felt so neutral towards anything was when I spent 3 hours watching Boyhood - the best movie made in the last decade according to some. These two movies share the exact same level of mediocrity and an overall impression of 'meh'.I guess I would advice casual viewers not to watch this as they will most likely still see a difference between generally well-received movie and generally hated movie. To those who have lost the border already, this isn't any worse choice than your average 8.xx rated title on IMDb - and you might as well spent 2 hours watching it.",Independence Day - Resurgence
193,goolizap,Twizard Rating: 74,7,1 July 2016,"In 1996, we didn't have a whole lot of alien invasion movies. In fact, Independence Day was, by far, the biggest one ever in existence. It prided itself on it. And you could say it started an avalanche of similar genre films in the 20 years since its release. So, naturally, the sequel needed to be much much bigger. Luckily, it delivers.The new alien ship spans an entire continent, and Earth's existence is much more threatened this time around. It turns out that the same aliens from the last movie are back to annihilate our planet.Like the first film, there are a handful of story lines. Many people banning together for a common cause. While not helping fix the depth issue of these movies, that's how we would need to do it in real life. Especially for an attack of this magnitude.But what helps continue the original realism from the first film is slightly negated by the futuristic feel from the get-go. Drones hover around an ultramodern Washington D.C. and there is an entire group of military personnel living on the Moon. While 1996 felt like 1996, 2016 is more along the lines of Back to the Future Part 2.While the action is big, the CGI feels very unoriginal and uninspired.But that's all forgivable. What's not is the convoluted premise. It may not seem to matter. We get, more or less, that there's a big alien trying to wipe out our race, but we're unsure why it's happening, how it's different from the first film, and why anyone in the movie knows what they know. Oh, and the acting is horrendous. Will Smith's stepson, Dylan, from the original is all grown up now, following in Smith's footsteps as a military pilot, and someone must've informed him to utilize his entire face when delivering each line. He gives his own version of the Bill Pullman speech from 1996. It's awful. He's not the actor who played the role in the original. But at this point, they might as well have just hired the same guy. This current actor has no obvious benefit over the first. Maybe it's because he's good-looking? Yeah, that's important. The rest of his cohorts are almost just as bad. They're obviously hired for their appearances, rather than their acting abilities. And the dialogue is already dumbed-down way before they get their fidgety little hands on it. The depth created for these characters is contrived just to reel in the kids. But the acting is just unacceptable--even for such a large scale movie.Will Smith isn't in this one. Don't even bother expecting him to make a surprise appearance. You may think, ""He's too integral to the enjoyment of the first film not to be in this one."" And you'd be right. It's like Chris Tucker not being in Next Friday. Luckily, Judd Hirsch and Jeff Goldblum reprise their roles. Hirsch brings some much needed life to this film. His storyline is the least important, but the most engaging out of the whole thing.The film's faults fortunately give it a really corny '90s feel, which, at the very least, makes this film fun. And the momentum builds well, so we can actually enjoy ourselves. The individual pieces in this film shouldn't make up an impressive project. But somehow, the small instances of light shine through and are just good enough to make this movie watchable. But ultimately, this film shouldn't depend on a few scenes by two actors to make it so.Twizard Rating: 74",Independence Day - Resurgence
194,drew_atreides,"If you liked the first, you probably won't mind this...",7,23 June 2016,"...i always enjoyed the original Independence Day. It had about everything a full-blooded teenage boy could want..Jets shooting spaceships, explosions and more explosions....Throw in a star making performance for Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum doing his Jurassic Park thing and Bill Pullman as about the coolest President ever and you had a great popcorn flick that pretty much revived the disaster movie. ID: Resurgence is not quite as good the original... To be honest, it is quite quickly paced, which isn't a bad thing, but stuff happens very quickly.. You don't have the build-up and sense of wonder/dread that the first film delivered. In this one, stuff blows up early and often.The technology in the movie IS pretty neat. I liked seeing what the makers of the film were able to dream up as far as how we would assimilate the alien tech with our own. There is a lot of cool eye candy here. The old guard turn in decent performances, and to be honest the new blood isn't entirely annoying. I do feel like they kinda shoe-horned Brent Spiner in, but Dr. Okun is a fun character, so okay. There is a lot of cheese and a lot of ""oh, come on!"" moments, but if you just go with it the movie is popcorn fun. And it does end in a nice place that leaves you wanting to see what happens next.This isn't an Oscar winner, but it is good fun.",Independence Day - Resurgence
195,angiris,"Bad on a grotesque level. Literally everything that's wrong with cheap, knock-off sequels with zero creativity.",3,28 June 2016,"I was hopefully going in. But after 30 minutes I had given up and just wanted the film to end. How for the love of Christ can you even call yourself a Director or Writer, having participated in the creation of this horrific trash. Jesus Christ I don't even know what to say. The film is so rushed. Its so annoying and packing so many clichés it will make your head spin. It's trying to cover so much and fails in such an epic manner equal to its attempt to make this as Michael Bay Transformers like as possible. And to those of you who enjoy that, fair enough but view what I'm saying in the negative aspect of that. Explosions, zero character build up, barely any introduction to anything. Just...here's your cliché, run of the mill hero dude space cowboy who is so incredibly dis-likable its unreal. The lack of credibility is astounding in every single aspect of this film. To the extent we may as well include pretty much ANY alien in ANY sci fi film ever at this point. And I just don't understand how the hell this was approved. Its a certifiable cash-in. Which is unreal considering its a sequel to an otherwise successful film 20 years ago. And Goldblum, Pullman and more return now for what reason? To literally make a mockery of this concept and the original film? I did not expect this. Not from this film anyway. Im just glad Smith wasn't here. Jesus... talk about dodging a bullet at the size of a truck. Or alien spacecraft for that matter. So here's a rundown of the film: We've colonized the moon. Gotten hugely ahead in technology, build a planetary defense system using alien tech. And we appear so confident and courageous. Thats the first 25 minutes of the movie. We meet some bare-boned characters and ...yeah. Thats that. Unfortunately this mindless cowboy attitude has us shoot down friendly aliens coming to save us, followed by a massive alien spacecraft steamrolling our defense system because it sucks and takes 10 years to fire. Great job right there. Then we get invaded, and in like 10 minutes the entire world looks like its been nuked 20 times. Then we get an inspiring speech taken straight from the first one which doesn't really do much other than making you cringe. Our 4 main characters which we know ZERO about go on a suicide mission and land on the enemy spacecraft, then Thors brother decides to smile whilst flipping off the aliens in the control room on the ship, urinate on the ship and highlight whilst smiling that they killed his family. I'm not joking... then gunfights break out once again and its just pew pew pew for another 30 minutes until the movie ends. Did Michael Bay direct this? No? Well I'll be damned. What else? Well apparently everyone is a fighter pilot too now. Because...reasons. Even the Pullmans daughter from the 1st movie. The new president here is barely fleshed out. Her entire role can be summed up in 4 words. No surrender, kill aliens. Real depth to that one. She dies as well. Zero reaction to it as well.Goldblums dad is here again. Being annoying and out of place because they had to include that annoying aspect from the original of course. Which highlights this films FREQUENT attempts at being comical WHICH FAIL...countless times. Its CRINGE worthy. ""sigh"" This film made me angry. And that's because this could have been really good. But they try commit the traditional Hollywood sin of biting off much more than they can chew and just...go with it anyway.I think the most unforgivable thing is the fact that they try to appeal to children and comedy. How the hell are we supposed to take this seriously? I mean what kind of ...god I wish I could curse in this view, but dummy... steals a bus, full of children to drive to Area 51 to see his son. And upon arriving hes smiling and saying ""This kids wanna see you (Big smile) Only to realize. Ohh. There's 5000 aliens behind me trying to kill us all. Ah well. What in the living F... Is this supposed to be a serious, alien invasion disaster movie? Or cheap comedy. Its like these writers sat down and said: hey. Lets make a cross of Independence day, Mars Attacks and of course James Camerons Alien with the intent of making it as inhumanly bad as remotely possible. Not to mention the lame one-liners.I can't even begin to tell you how many times characters begin to screaming and yell in the cringiest fashion from miles away from one another in an attempt to appear dramatic or emotional. Only Brent Spiner prevents this film from being abysmal. Hes the only good thing here and interesting. Sadly the focus is on flashy lights rather than Spiner who wants to discover knowledge about the Friendly Alien. But that would make for a GOOD movie so we can't have that, now can we Emmerich? Nicolas Wright, James Woods, you should be ashamed of yourself. The fact that a 3rd movie is already planned is insanity. This is garbage. Change the script immediately for the third or give up. This is terrible and the next one will be as well because you've set the standard SO LOW. STOP MAKING FILMS LIKE THIS. This script is written as i if your audience consists of ignorants with zero cinema experience. Of Children. Jesus. The longer I saw this film, the lower the score got. This is a 3.

196,CherryBlossomBoy,Five screenwriters for five years old audience,3,5 July 2016,"In my aging eyes Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin are some sort of pioneers... ground-breakers, if you will. When the first ""Independence Day"" came out in 1996, I thought it was the dumbest mainstream blockbuster I've ever seen and that it's not possible to ever make anything dumber. Ever. Since then ""Armageddon"", ""Pearl Harbor"", ""Day After Tomorrow"", ""Godzilla"" and the likes came into existence. Now that ""dumb blockbuster"" IS the mainstream, and now that all of them look alike - Emmerich and Devlin still managed to pull another ""dumbest ever"". Congratulations, chaps! It was totally worth seeing it for that fact alone.It would be a pain for me to go through the motions of analyzing this flashy but disjointed and airless regurgitation of the barely-worthy-predecessor, just as it was a pain for the film crew to put it together, so perhaps bringing up a couple of major annoyances should fill the requirements for this review:A clunky and too obvious exposition, stupid plot and even stupider and unengaging subplots and backstories.""Orange and Teal"" color scheme. It's ubiquitous and tiresome and they didn't even make it well. The majority of shots were just drenched in blue/gray, or alternately in red/orange. They should at least have followed the look of the original.Judd Hirsch. The unfortunate fact that he's still alive didn't warrant his reappearance in the sequel. He already ruined every scene he was in the first time around. Now he's twice as old and four times as irritating.No less than four comic relieves. Four of them! Woods, Wright, Spiner and Hirsch. None of them even remotely funny or needed.Vivica Fox, who would have possibly provided a great lead, was just wasted to make room for bland but higher paid colleagues.The white talking Orb from the mysterious ""other"" alien race. It looked not as much as an Apple product as something lifted from the ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"". Didn't fit because it was comical and wasn't meant to be. When it paid the slimiest and the most condescending ever homage to humans for winning the fight it became clear that the target audience for this film were kids.All the main characters talk way too much, in an incessant bombardment of words with almost no relief throughout the film.I think that's enough. ""Independence Day"" is affectionately called ""ID"" and I think it's not without merit. In the sea of bland epic disaster flicks it does have an identity - it brands itself by stupidity. In the original it worked to its advantage - this time it doesn't. But don't skip on it: you have to see it to believe it.",Independence Day - Resurgence

They don't look like they want to be there, in fact Brent Spiner's reprised role was awful, I for one have never seen him act so badly as in this film.Regardless of this nonsense acting and cliché young bucks in the military, trying to be hero. We have some major sci-fi problems. My main issue with this whole film, is we see in the first five minutes that we used the alien technology after the big battle, so why on earth do we see people still using outdated smartphones and laptops? The characters are flying around in anti-gravity ships but yet we still use archaic smartphones and laptop computers, with a traditional looking operating system? This makes absolutely no sense at all. It's like the writers said, ""well when it comes to communicating with one another in this sci-fi world we created, they must not use any alien technology to communicate to one another"". How stupid is this movie on a scale of one to ten? I give it a one, just for the special effects, and that's it, the actors were terrible, the characters were cliché, and the technology was a mishmash.

198,sjarja,guilty pleasure maybe,6,29 July 2016,"Well, i went into that movie expecting 2 very boring hours (happens when you are dragged there by friends) - but i left with mixed feelings.So lets get the bad things out of the way The story is about as exciting as watching paint dry. It is overly US patriotic - although less than the original one - and it introduces so many characters that i really do not care for any of them.The CGI was surprisingly terrible. How can that be? - This movie is kind of centered around the CGI - but some scenes literally looked worse than your weekly Star Trek ""alien planet backdrop"" or a PS2 cutscene (and no, i mean PS2 not 3 or 4) - It is the first time i thought about a modern movie CGI ""hm - the texture on those models really uses some low resolution..."" But there are also good things that SHOULD be acknowledged....This movie manages to portrait the scale of it very well. (not perfectly though - but in terms of cinematics i do not think its practical to portrait an object over 3000 miles large in a realistic way - cause then we wouldn t see much of it) Compared to many other movies however - the scale is kind of ground breaking.What i cannot stress enough is that it had the balls to tell a story from the point where the last movie left off. It is a sequel and not a silly reboot - and i do think it is much harder to invent an entire new earth than just start at a point where earth is now.So - finally ....... make no mistake - the movie is bad. It is clichéd, the acting is kind of average - and even the action scenes are not awe inspiring.

199,boe_dye,Dr. Okums Underwear,2,4 January 2019,"One has to wonder ""am I getting too old to appreciate films"", or is it that these directors just have no good sense of film making anymore.To bring us up to speed on the ID4 franchise, we decided to watch the first one. 20 years later, it's still a solid movie. It's an American Film about American's leading the charge, pulling themselves up by the bootstraps against impossible odds, and leading the world to victory. A bit campy, yes, but It's coming from an era where Hulk Hogan was a great American Hero, and nationalism and patriotism weren't four letter words.And you could hack Alien Technology with an Apple Powerbook...It was epic, it was explosive, it was a good story and the good guys won. I still got a chill over the Bill Pullman speech.This however was just... boring....The biggest flaw was that it was simply too big to be believable. After the Mothership enveloped 1/3 of the planet, drops an EMP and started mining, in my mind the insurmountable odds really became insurmountable. It's like ""how do you really expect to beat that"" unless you deus ex machina the bejezus out of the story, and that simply is what happens.In the original, you had time to care about the actors. This was more characters doing more things, and then things happen, and then there are things. You are expected to care about the characters not because they are important or interesting, but because you are told that in order to enjoy the film, you need to care about these characters.The replaying of tropes from the original also got annoying and tiresome. We get it, one liner here, echo back to something there... That's just lazy script writing. And of course, you have the dorky side character for the quasi comedy relief. I can't think of a movie I have seen lately where there wasn't a dorky male character being a dork.Nowadays it's fair to say that Chinese Production companies are ruling Hollywood and it shows. China has become the big market to appease for films, and so a lot of movies that have come out in the past 10 / 15 years are more catered to Chinese Markets rather than Western Markets. So you have an action, a commedy, and a drama all wrapped up into one. I wont say I don't mind a bit of humor in action films, but not to the point where characters become charicatures of themselves as in the case of Dr. Okum. In the original he was a serious, albeit eccentric doctor. In this, he was more like the eccentric mad scientists who was kept around for comedic purposes.Not surprised it didn't do well, and even less surprised that there wont be a third one. Could have been interesting, but just moves from topic to topic like one rambling run on sentence.

200,Sunsphxsuns,When Did $387 million In Gross Sales Become A Hollywood Disappointment?,9,29 September 2016,"On June 24, 2016, Independence Day: Resurgence (ID2) was released in 2D, 3D, and IMAX 3D in the United States. In the opening weekend, ID2 took in $41.6 million, notably less than the $76.9 million opening weekend ticket sales from its predecessor, Independence Day (ID1). In spite of a weaker than anticipated opening weekend, as of this writing, Independence Day: Resurgence has grossed $387 million against its $165 million production budget. And the highly anticipated BR/DVD hasn't even been released yet. Nevertheless, analysts consistently bemoan that ID2's ""numbers are disappointing,"" even though the film's earnings have more than doubled its investment. In any casino, race track, or financial institution in the world, doubling one's money has always been considered ""a very good thing."" Apparently Hollywood doesn't agree. THE ID FRANCHISE: Setting aside the numbers, let's discuss the ID franchise. Until the release of Independence Day in 1996, no previous science fiction film had ever been so visually powerful, and at times almost overwhelming in terms of sheer size. For example, the alien ""mothership"" orbiting the Earth was 340 miles in diameter, and it deployed a few dozen ""city destroyer"" spacecraft, each of these measuring 15 miles in width. ID1 was so visually startling it made Star Wars look like a Roger Corman ""B"" movie by comparison. The sheer scale of the film was undeniably astonishing. Size mattered. In a perfect cinematic universe, Independence Day: Resurgence should probably have been released in 1997, one year after ID1. If that had happened the transition of time and change would have been easier for the audience to absorb. But for many reasons, including the lack of a worthy script, this simply could not be. REASONS TO SEE ID2: There are plenty of reasons to see Independence Day: Resurgence, especially if you enjoyed the first film. We've quietly traveled 20 years into the future where much has changed. There is the introduction of new characters (Liam Hemsworth, Jessie Usher), and, the sad demise of a few past characters (Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Vivica A. Fox). Actors aside, we witness the glorious presentation of super- evolved hybrid alien/human technology. It took 20 years, and the bio-armored, slimy, nefarious aliens who are bent on exterminating the human race, have returned to finish the job. But we clever Earthlings have learned how to employ much of the advanced alien weaponry left in the wake of the first confrontation. When the bad guys return to our little blue world for round 2, this time, Earth will be ready for them. All of the fun and joy found in the original film are generously retained in this intelligent offering, and it is precisely here that director Roland Emmerich's challenge to create an entertaining (and profitable) sequel is a success! It's a big film, with big characters, big CGI effects, big humor and big drama. It's especially big on FUN, the main reason why many of us always enjoy an outing at the theater. REASONS NOT TO SEE ID2: Perhaps you've been misled by some of the negative CRITIC or USER reviews on IMDb and elsewhere? See it for yourself. It's a fabulous film. IN CONCLUSION: Hollywood number crunchers are a curious bunch, but I suppose someone has to do it. Genuine fans of film, however, are gutsy, and able to transcend conventional wisdom. If they weren't, movies like ""It's A Wonderful Life"" would still be buried in the vaults. I'm looking forward to the release of ID3, where it appears a technology-advanced Earth will be taking the fight to our enemies in deep space. And given Emmerich's penchant for always providing fans an ample amount of pure entertainment value, I'm betting that his next entry in this franchise will be the crown jewel of them all.",Independence Day - Resurgence

203,Field78,They master the art of spectacle; now get someone to write a decent screenplay,7,15 July 2016,"Please let me start by making a confession: I have been a fan of Roland Emmerich for decades. Critics be damned: I love his talent for taking B-movie premises and transforming them into big-budget, special effects-heavy, spectacle-driven epics. I thoroughly enjoyed Stargate, ID4, Godzilla (yes, even that one), The Patriot, Day After Tomorrow, 2012, Anonymous and (slightly less) White House Down, and oh well, I'll even defend 10,000 BC for being a bit of guilty pleasure. With ID4, he cemented his reputation as a director who couples the art of showing destruction with some good old-fashioned fun. Unfortunately, his reputation as a storyteller is less solid. With the passing of the years, he has the increasing tendency to fall back on clichés, linear plotting, flat characterizations, overblown patriotism, or excessive lack of subtleties. Some people find his movies near- unwatchable for it; I'll maintain that I am not overly annoyed by it as long as the spectacle is good. With ID4, apart from some excessive bombastic heroics, I even think he had found the right mold for the story: teasing the audience in the first act, unleashing hell in the second, and delivering the knock-out in the finale. And all moderated with some great humor. Even a lot of serious critics couldn't deny that his mix of popcorn entertainment with state-of-the-art special effects put new life into the disaster movie genre. So I really hoped that Emmerich would repeat that very same trick for this late follow-up to ID4, but alas. Repeating he did, but without much of his magic touch. This is one of the few times that he managed to disappoint me, although not to the extent of me completely tearing it apart and trampling the remains into the dirt, as some people find necessary. It's hard to pinpoint exactly what went wrong: did he finally loose his inspiration? Did he destroy the world so many times already that it is starting to become routine? Or was his head so much into the action that he forgot to glue it all together with a halfway decent story? As said before, storytelling isn't Emmerich's strongest point, but in ID4, he at least knew how to build the tension by slowly revealing the upcoming alien invasion, up to the classic scene where the UFOs slowly reveal themselves as ominous shadows over the big cities. In ID:R, he doesn't seem to feel the need for originality or building tension: the big scenes of the original are copied down in a 'bigger-is-better' format, but with a big hurry. Upon re-watching, I think much of the blame lies in the editing: the invasion and ensuing mayhem is over before we know it, and unlike the first movie, it is nearly impossible to tell what is happening where. The tearing down of landmarks feels familiar up to the point of becoming obligatory, and when the best pilots come together to make one big assault on the mothership, it starts to become repetitive. The special effects look convincing enough, but due to the extreme rush and absence of a wow-factor, it didn't engage me half as much as the roller-coaster ride of the original movie. A lot of the fun previously came from a great cast of actors, but Will Smith as the tough funnyman is regrettably absent. Veterans Bill Pullman and Jeff Goldblum get a few moments to shine, as does Brent Spiner, but most of the cast cannot really fill the void. Liam Hemsworth makes a decent try, as does Maika Monroe, and the inclusion of an African warlord as a hero can even be called innovative. But most of the other supporting actors, like Nicolas Wright as the stuck-up government man, are annoyingly cliché, uninteresting and/or unfunny. I felt sorry for Judd Hirsch and his redundant plot line where he rescues a couple of refugee kids, which really amounted to nothing except to create some tension and bickering with his son in the finale. Much of the movie's problems can be blamed on the screenplay, that just wants to do too much and follow too many people in too short a time ('only' 120 minutes). There is a promising subplot (the helpful alien species) that should have been given proper priority, but it serves more as a McGuffin at the end. You'd think that 5 screenwriters could come up with better drama and jokes, but here it sometimes plunges into cringe-worthy depths where even Michael Bay wouldn't dare. If they really go forward with a second sequel, as is announced at the end, then let's hope that they can get somebody like J.J. Abrams on board, who knows how to use old elements with fresh inspiration.Still, I have to admit, when nearing the end, Emmerich dares to take the story in a different direction, which gives the movie a dearly needed injection of energy. The jet pilots escaping from the mothership is pretty funny, and the thrilling finale with the oversized Queen feels like Emmerich is back in shape. Although it cannot completely compensate for the general blandness of what came before, at least it shows he hasn't completely lost his trick. I'd like to see this spark of energy and inspiration if it really comes to ID3.So although it could (and should) have been much better, I wouldn't completely throw away ID:R like so many people do. Between the eye-rolling moments, there are some nice action scenes and some promising plot elements, and the finale really saved a lot. The way it looks now, ID3 is still good to go (although nothing is certain in Hollywood until the cameras role), so let's hope this was a set-up for a much better threequel.",Independence Day - Resurgence
204,AliensReservoir,Just a transition for the third one,4,28 June 2016,"The actors are not convincing in their characters, at all ! it's like none of them have learned what they need to say, but instead it look like someone told them at the last minute what they need to say in front of the camera : result = dialogue are flat - very-very flat, i can do it a lot better and i am not an actor. --------Here come the big spoiler--------------------------------- The second type of alien species (which is more a coalition of different survivor aliens) to help us is good but not really developed, hum at all, it's only at the end where we know that the third ID movie will be something like a star wars to eradicate those telepathic alien from the galaxy.overall it's a good action/sci-fi movie, but the story is lost somewhere at the script writers level and behind the camera.Director should be fired .... for ever! Script Writers should be fired and forbidden to write any story for the next 10 years. And Will Smith won't save the movie even if he have gotten in there, because it's all behind the camera that it was badly made.The mad scientist from area 51 came back, i was very surprised because he was dead in the first ID (the president bodyguard took its pulse and if you remember the bodyguard did a ""No"" with his head), so after 20 years in a coma he came back, and in fact it was him who ""saved"" some part of the movie(sadly not developed enough).Overall you won't care about all the dead characters because you even don't know them, no story like in Asylum movies (series Z movies), CGI are OK, though i caught a lot of flaws ...At the end ... I prefer by far to watch Kung fu Panda 3 with my kids, at least there is a story more than good enough for adults.",Independence Day - Resurgence
205,jb07-660-944395,Independence Day: Regurgitated,3,10 July 2016,"This movie is a shadow of the first. With the number of screen writers credited, it is amazing that it is so bad.We have no character development, and as usual, the enemy is so much stronger than us weak humans. Surely the fact that the newly developed weapons used to defend earth, taking almost an hour to charge up might be seen as a problem? That gives them enough time to knock out the friendly alien, but of course the enemy alien wipes out our defenses with ease.The movie comes across as a cross between Star Trek and a B Grade Sci Fi Movie. The character's dialogue is embarrassingly corny, and this along with the lack of build up, makes for a very boring movie.",Independence Day - Resurgence
206,clarkmick33,BaNG BaNG BooM – Typical Hollywood Doom,5,28 June 2016,"My imagination was lighted up as a child watching the original Independence Day – the original mixed Hollywood CGI, explosions, drama, humour, apocalyptic dread all into a neat little movie. I was looking forward to the sequel living up to its potential. However after seeing this movie last night I felt like a buffalo had done a diarrhoea dump in my ear.With Independence Day sequel it feels like they took all the creative people off the project and placed some Hollywood executives there in their place. The movie followed a predictable story format. It seemed edited to pieces to fit into a neat timeframe. There was no suspense, no real thinking just main characters going in guys a blazing and somehow miraculous coming out the other end in one piece.It is pretty obvious they were trying to appeal to the Chinese market in this movie – with Chinese product placement and a Chinese female lead who while looking pretty does need to take a few more lesson on how to ACT! Her expression seemed the same in every shot.The introduced protagonists had no real back story just really that they previously flew together and had an accident and one was white and the other black.The only actor that really held it together for me was Jeff Goldblum and the actor that played his dad. Yet even Jeff seemed to be tired in his performance.Sorry Hollywood (as with Transformers) bigger is NoT better –if you are looking for a movie with great story, character development and suspense it is not this movie. If you are looking to watch explosions, Bigger alien spaceships and blast your way out of everything story then this is for you",Independence Day - Resurgence

208,Cinnyaste,The Donald Trump Of Films,1,30 June 2016,"Even in the Popcorn Movie oeuvre this film is a major disappointment: Soulless, insipid, insulting to one's intelligence. But boy are the SFX great! (Who cares.)It's twenty years too late, for one. Truly despicable, for two. Films created specifically to launch other films, that is. Cobbing an idea from ""Falling Skies,"" ""ID: R"" finds a friendly ally to fight an intergalactic war against the Universe-Hopping-To-Suck-Your-Planet-Core aliens. You know, kinda like the Borg, but far less believable. I wonder how the alien light drives work fueled by magma. Must be some special gas, er, magma tank to withstand hotter-than-the-sun 11,000 F molten metal. Maybe the magma cools. Oh, I see. It's really a drive running on iron. Guess these aliens haven't figured how to mine iron from unpopulated worlds (and heat it to molten?).Then there's a queen. All that's missing from those scenes is Ripley shouting, ""Get away from my planet's core, you bitch!""Brent Spiner is ecstatic. Lot's more screen time, and the final word. The rest - Jeff Goldblum and Judd Hirsch the biggest perpetrators - either phone it in or sleepwalk through contrived scenes in a story so predictable eyes flutter with drowsiness waiting for it to unfold. And how did Hirsch, all alone, find his son in that huge desert? It's best not to ask questions as these for the resultant desire is to self-flagellate for sitting through this excruciatingly awful mess.There's much to be said for brainless entertainment where one allows the idiocy to run down the back like water on a duck. Then there's braindead entertainment such as this useless, bland sequel to a better, far more fun film. Attend a showing if you must. You've been forewarned - your IQ will fall sixteen points, but get used to it.Current BO is $50M domestic, $115M international. More and more crap will be made for foreign markets, notably China.",Independence Day - Resurgence
209,tjgoalie13,Ultra Dumb and Generic,5,25 June 2016,"Independence Day: Resurgence is here, and it would seem with the direction they went that Independence Day may have been better if it hadn't had a sequel. The original film was admittedly dumb, and considering Roland Emmerich's filmography I didn't go in expecting this film to be thought provoking, but Independence Day: Resurgence lacks the impactful moments the first one had. Independence Day: Resurgence is full of clichés, features weak characters, and lacks the iconic moments of the original. It is sad to say but given the filmography of Roland Emmerich, the fact that this movie isn't very good isn't a surprise.The original Independence Day wasn't very original, but it found a way to surpass it's generic approach with entertaining acting and storytelling. However, Independence Day: Resurgence loses some of that charm, and ends up being even more generic. The story takes a radical departure from the realistic approach of the first one, and puts the audience in a super technologically advanced earth. The film is also hurt by the lack of charismatic leads, who have been replaced by young more dull actors.The problem is partially that the actors aren't all that good, whether that's a lack of direction or a lack of ability is up for debate. That being said the actors are only part of the problem, as even if they were great the characters are one dimensional. Another major problem is that the original film was a perfect example of dumb fun, where it was funny and frankly dumb, the sequel is just as dumb, if not more and half as funny. The end result is when a major character dies or anything happens in this film it's hard to care.The lack of care for major moments resonates as the ultimate disappointment of Independence Day: Resurgence. Even if you hate Independence Day you can't deny that when Bill Pullman delivers his speech, everybody watching gets a little emotional, and there are various other moments from that film that resonate. There are next to none of these moments in Independence Day: Resurgence. In the end Independence Day: Resurgence is boring because it's not emotionally gripping, and just trugs along.Independence Day: Resurgence is in essence a sequel made purely for the profit, that departs from what made the first film so special. The sequel is inferior to the original in most aspects, and in some areas doesn't even feel like a sequel to Independence Day. The characters are one dimensional, the story is generic and clichéd, the dialogue is weak, the film is incredibly dumb, but admittedly the special effects are amazing. In the end if you like action and want a release where you can go and just shut your brain off, then this is for you, otherwise you may be disappointed.",Independence Day - Resurgence
210,blackwidowis7cool,"An excellent sequel, worthy of attention",8,24 July 2019,"Set in 2016, it is twenty years after the aliens attacked earth in 1996. After the first attack, the world leaders came together and created a One World Government. In Independence Day: Resurgence, humanity has salvaged alien technology from the fallen flying saucers and technology is far advanced.
The now ex-president of the United States, Whitmore (Bill Pullman) appears in the start of the film, receiving a vision of the aliens travelling through space, with wrecked planets in their wake. And Earth is their next destination.
Also, Dr. Brackish Okun, who has been in a coma ever since the alien attacked him, wakes up. David Levinson has been made director of the Earth Space Defense (ESD). He travels to Africa and meets with warlord Dikembe Umbutu and Dr. Catherine Marceaux in the African state Republique Nationale d'Umbutu. They travel to an intact alien city destroyer and discover that alien survivors sent a distress call to their home world before their defeat. While there, Umbutu (DeObia Oparei) tells Marceaux and Levinson that when the destroyed saucer mysteriously turned back on (the same one that they are visiting in Africa), he received a vision of a spherical ship that he described as 'fear', same as other patients of Marceaux who are telepathically linked to the aliens.
During the 4th of July celebrations, a mysterious spherical ship emerges near the Moon Base from a wormhole. The World Council want to shoot it down, fearing another alien attack, but Levinson protests, stating that they don't know who they are and they could unintentionally start a war. The Council doesn't listen, and has the Moon Base shoot it down. Levinson wants to go up to the Moon to inspect the wreck to discover who the aliens are, but is instructed to stay for July 4th. So, two Americans on the Moon Base - Jake Morrison (Liam Hemsworth) and Charlie Miller (Travis Tope) - steal a space tug and take Levinson, Umbutu, Marceaux, and U.S. federal controller Floyd Rosenberg (Nicolas Wright) up to the Moon. They go to the wreck and find that inside part of the ship's wreck is a large container with a giant white sphere. While going to retrieve it, an alien mothership suddenly appears, responding to the signal sent out from the saucer in Africa. It destroys the Moon Base and destroys a lot of the earth's planetary defenses. It then lands over the North Atlantic Ocean.
Also, it also has it's own gravity and lifts up city buildings, cars, and people, which then all drop down.
This is where some of the characters from the first movie are killed - Jasmine Hiller (Vivica A. Fox), (Steven Hiller is mentioned to have died before the sequel). But, this time, Emmerich does not destroy the White House. The space tug with Morrison, Miller, Levinson, Umbutu, Floyd and Marceaux also travels back down to earth with the mothership. They travel to Area 51. After the mothership lands over the ocean, it begins drilling down to the earth's core.
In Area 51, Whitmore interrogates one of the aliens in captivity, but his mind is telepathically invaded by the alien, much like Dr. Okun's experience, and learn that the aliens exist in eusociality and that one of their colossal Queens is commanding the invasion. But, when Marceaux shows him a drawing of the spherical ship, it reacts in fear. They kill the alien, freeing Whitmore, who is placed in a coma from the experience. Levinson hypothesizes that, if they kill the supervising Queen, her forces will cease drilling and retreat. An ESD aerial fleet, led by Captain Dylan Hiller, stages a counterattack, but they are caught in a trap within the mothership, leaving only a few survivors, including Dylan, Jake, Charlie, and fellow ESD lieutenant and Chinese pilot Rain Lao.
Okun opens the container and takes the sphere out, which they discover used to be part of another alien race that changed to a virtual existence. The sphere tells them that the aliens are going from planet to planet, harvesting the natural resources to preserve their existence. The sphere also says that she takes the survivors to a secret refuge planet and is going to unite them in an attack against the Harvesters' home base. Meanwhile, In the mothership, all surviving ESD pilots manage to escape by hijacking enemy craft; Dylan, Jake, Charlie, and Rain navigate two Harvester fighters to pursue the Queen's personal ship, which is heading to Area 51 to extract information from the sphere about the refugee planet. The Harvester Queen becomes aware of the sphere's existence and location and heads towards Area 51. In Area 51, they recreate the sphere's signal and lead the ship towards a trap. Some of the Queen's ships begin attacking Area 51.
Whitmore enters the ship and blows it up, sacrificing himself. At first, they all think that the Queen's dead, but her ships still attack them. Then the Queen emerges from the wreck. She heads for the part of the Area 51 base where the sphere is hidden. Her ships swarm around her, protecting her. The Queen grabs the sphere. Morrison, Miller, Dylan, and Rain - who are in two of the Queen's ships - break free from the swarm and kill the Queen.
The ship drilling in the Ocean towards the earth's core stops just two minutes from breaching the core and the ships retreat, called back by the other Harvester Queens.
At the end of the film, Okun tells everyone that the sphere wants to give them advanced technology to travel to the Harvesters' planet and fight them to get rid of them once and for all.
I LOVE this movie! An excellent sequel, magnificent special effects, great storyline. Oh, I forgot to mention why the Harvesters were drilling towards the earth's core - to drain the resources, which would destroy earth's magnetic field or something, killing all life on earth. It has more action, and excitement than the first one and has a much bigger threat to humanity than the first one. But, I think the first one is actually the best.
It's a pity that it was not popular like the first movie, as then Emmerich would have done a third film about them travelling to the Harvesters' planet and engaging them in a fight to destroy the Harvesters. It would have made an excellent end to the story and would have made a great movie. I also love how they include the telepathic link between some of the humans and the aliens as it creates an interesting element. In fact, my favourite line in the whole movie is when Whitmore wakes up from his coma and says: ""You've got to warn them! She knows that they are coming."" In conclusion, I would recommend watching this. It is enjoyable, fun, tense, and exciting.",Independence Day - Resurgence
211,tecnogaming,I feel compelled to give my opinion... this is GARBAGE !!!,1,28 September 2016,"I love to review movies, in fact, I own a blog where I review movies and TV chapters because, yes, I do like to give my opinion about these things. My native language is NOT English but Spanish so It's harder for me to express in another language as fluently as my native tongue but here it is..I felt COMPELLED to give my rating and comment because, I was a fan of ID4 (the original, not this atrocity). I grow up with the image of those mother-ships striking the empire state and the white house.I consider the original predictable in some parts and full of American reference but BRILLIANT in how it handled the beginning of the movie up to the point of the actual ATTACK. I consider that Roland Emmerich and it's team did a SUPERB job at creating a captivating moment and the tension leading up to the attack is very real.I watched the original 3 times in a row, in cinemas and I got goosebumps each time. I own the special edition DVD and watched it more than 20 times already.I really wanted to like this and so I am biased, biased towards giving it a higher score because I loved the original, but still.. I give it a 1 out of 10. In fact, if I wasn't a fan of the original I would probably give it a -5.The reasons I'm so mad at Roland Emmerich is that he really strike a cord in me, he now royally made me mad in ways no other director did, in fact, I consider him BELOW Uwe Boll level for this one.Characters: For starters, he shows a complete disregard for the lovable characters he created in the original, they are all shadows of what they once were, he over-cliché everything with the beard-long hair and grumpy-attitude of the Doctor Ookun and the Ex-President.He went ahead and created like 10 more characters, totally unnecessary, to... whatever he wanted to do.. which... didn't worked.The movie is so full of characters that jumps from one place to another that we end up feeling like there is no script at all !. Just a mumble-jumble mess of characters giving one-liners that ends up in nothing.Special Effects: Doing several star-ships wasn't enough, he wanted to showcase the power of the new armada by making a GIANT spaceship, the size of a planet... truth be told, the special effect is well done but it's not terrifying anymore. The thing that made the original so cool is the fact that we see several ships, a mother-ship, tons of armadas and tons of ships, it FELT like an invasion.. in this movie it feels like DUMB aliens who made an ULTRA BIGGER spaceship with zero armada, just to IMPRESS the humans.Script: There is not script, basically, we have to believe this huge armada is run by a SINGLE QUEEN who behaves like a MORON with no BRAINS. There are scenes that feels coming out directly from your worst SCI FI B-MOVIE nightmare, I won't go into details because I don't want to spoil your suffering, when you actually watch it (if you dare).One-Liners: This must be about the WORSE thing on the whole movie. All the characters are bend on delivering one-liners that feels like humanity had devolved in intelligence.When I started the movie I wanted the humans to win.. after watching the first HALF and ENDURING the pain of having to hear ludicrous lines of dialogue I REALLY WANTED the Aliens to reduce the planet to DUST. BUT after seeing the colossal failure on the aliens reasoning.. I wanted a BIG 50km ASTEROID to hit the earth and take humanity, the spaceship and the f*** aliens out in SMOKE.Having all died at the end would be a lot more satisfying ending than we've got.The last line of the movie is just like the tag line, seriously, who could watch a SCI FI movie with the tag line ""They messed with the wrong planet"".That resumes the whole idea for this movie.Recommended only for kids of 6 years and under that never watched the original.

Here, however, there is more effort put toward the world built after the events of the first movie, which is pointless given that it all gets destroyed here. The destruction scene in this movie, what the first is most famous for, is really short, and extremely ridiculous. It does, however, look spectacular. Even if the visuals can't make the movie good, you gotta appreciate the effort that went into making the movie look as good as it does. The characters are bland and forgettable. I don't even remember them. I know one of the guys is named Jake, but I don't remember which one. I also remember that there's a girl named Rey, but only because of Star Wars. They're action movie characters. This is the type of movie you go to just to watch aliens blow stuff up, and nothing else. Therefore, there's one thing this movie shouldn't be: boring. But it is. When there's no fighting or blowing up, it's just dull. Fun to look at, yes, but not at all interesting. It doesn't even have comic relief or anything like that. Worst of all, the ending was just a massive slap in the face. Without giving too much away, it's supposed to set up Independence Day 3, something I'm not really looking forward to at all.",Independence Day - Resurgence

216,midge56,Great but needs improvement,8,24 October 2016,"I loved the original. It was a great movie to watch but some moron wrote this one & spoiled our chances for a great trilogy. This movie definitely needed a better writer & director. Someone like Chris Columbus. There is a great DVD extra ""The war of 1996"" which fills in all the missing story background. The other extras are terrible. Goldblum ruins the gag reel. The movie is still worth watching despite our complaints on the bad writing.If Will Smith is going to demand $50 million to do a movie, I think it is time to start boycotting his films. He's a great actor but needs a lesson in humility.I also have no tolerance for stupidity IRL or in films. Stupidity such as:--shooting at something before finding out what it is. --counting down from 10 to 0 before firing at an attacker who blows up your weapons before you reach O. Just fire, morons. They didn't count down when firing at the friendly. --waiting 20 years to study the alien language & ship. --to only build a handful of defensive craft & weapons.--turning Hero President Whitmore into a moron, & copying his role from the drunk pilot who sacrificed himself on the original. --thinking original fans want to see copycat plots & themes. --having a hive queen leave the hive. --having Okun in a 20 year coma.--having the original cast psychically connected with visions of symbols.--having a bad writer & director deliberately turn every original cast character into humiliating morons to purposely trash their characters.--waiting 20 years to begin preparations for defense. --sticking the US craft under the mother ship. Then doing it twice with the stolen crafts stuck in a vortex.--a stupid, airheaded president insisting on a celebration before dealing with aliens.--having the mother ship scrape the moon.--putting gov't leaders in Cheyenne mountain where they were all killed in the original movie; so they could do it again in this movie with the same results?. Didn't they learn the first time? --Bringing in African warlords. Really?--having no detection system to see invaders BEFORE they arrived. --using the earths core as their target when we have water, food, animals, slaves and precious minerals & ores to harvest? --waiting for the last minute to evac mother. It was reboot Spocks mother all over again. Utter Stupidity. --Then there were the morons on the gold ship with rotten character attitudes. --Levinson's fathers role in this film was totally absurd. Everything was clearly written with a 10 year old boys mentally. The friendly alien sounded like a kindergarten teacher. Like a corny Disney character. If the core drill was that close to completion it would have pressure exploded. They claimed to have copied alien technology to build our defenses & craft but were totally unprepared. They also should have figured out shields & intergalactic travel from the first aliens technology they recovered. But they never figured out how to turn on the alien ships lights in 20 years.The primary actors roles were complete idiots except Dylan. Although, I'm not sure the audience these days could recognize an idiot.As for the friendly sphere: Outer Limits (orig) had a better version of alien refuges in spheres on the moon who sacrificed themselves.I also have to agree with the British about our shoving this Cowboy politics & swashbuckling hero mentality and Independence Day down their throats. Talk about lack of tact. The Russians & Chinese hate this swaggering US attitude as well. With the rednecks in Texas, I have to agree with the British, Russians & Chinese. We are blustering AH's. Why would they like a movie like that? We went to war with the British on Independence Day. I saw their comments. Their critics didn't appreciate this theme for the reasons I mentioned.Despite all these irritants and rotten writing it is still an enjoyable movie if you loved the original. But if there is a next time, get a decent writer & Director. Someone with imagination, education & common sense.However, these really nasty reviews are undeserved overkill by a bunch of hateful millennials getting even with their parents by trashing anything they loved out of pure spite. If you are going to trash something, do so because it deserves such treatment. Not as a weapon against your parents. The movie was still worth watching despite the bad writer & director just on tribute to the original movie alone. But it was missing memorable new key characters for the audience to bond with. The 4 new key characters were forgettable with dumb roles like punching the other in the face over an old grudge and behaving like irresponsible jerks who nearly caused a major accident. Cowboy daredevils. They cast a bunch of key roles with people you never connected with. They needed someone like Charliz Theron. Actors which grab your attention in a blockbuster film.I fear this writer & director & lackluster characters roles played by forgettable actors may have destroyed our chance for a third movie. At least they did not split the 2 films like they did with Harry Potter & Allegiant. That would have been the final straw to PO everyone.If you can overlook the utter stupidity of the writing it is still a good movie with all the borrowing from the original & effects. It is the plot & poor writing & bad directing which spoiled it.",Independence Day - Resurgence
217,Ben-Hibburd,Independence day: Resurgence review.,4,11 May 2017,"Independence Day: Resurgence takes place twenty years after the original film. Every nation on Earth has managed to solve it's problems and unite against a common enemy. Using Alien technology recovered from the fallen mothership of the last film, humanity has managed to build a global defence system to repel future Invaders. Except this time even more advanced Aliens attack and bring Earths defences down. It's now down to a bunch of newcomers and a few familiar faces to save earth once more.The first 20 minutes of the film has an intriguing somewhat original premise. All Nations are working together using advanced tech mixed with Human tech. Unfortunately that Interesting sub-plot decides to stop there. Instead the film divulges into a re-hash of all the set pieces from the first film. President pep-talk, check. Communicating with the Alien behind a glass wall, check. A scene that regurgitates Randy Quaids characters sacrifice from the first film, check. Punching an Alien in the face when It lands on Earth, check. I could go on but i digress. The film does have a good pace to it. It's also edited competently enough so you can see whats happening on screen. The films biggest problem is that all the new characters fall completely flat. None of them have any semblance of a personality, which left me feeling cold and uninterested in their plight. Even Jeff Goldblum looks completely bored as he reprises his role of David from the first film. On a positive note Bill Pullman seems as though he's trying as President Whitmore, and Brent Spiner looks as though he's having a blast chewing the scenery. Over-all the film is a letdown on what was a promising opening half hour until it descends into what I can only describe as a 'greatest hits' film, filled with bland, uninteresting characters.",Independence Day - Resurgence

Might make a good small screen series for lovers of not too scientific SciFi. Likable cast and decent direction.Leaves a lot of material for some good episodes.

219,Oberrated,Hella Underwhelming...,3,23 June 2016,"This film is cliché to unreal measures, extremely predictable and illogical (even beyond the concept that we are dealing with aliens) to infuriating points. Characters you may have cared about in the original film become an afterthought. These new and young characters have zero screen presence to make you want to root for them. If you wish to see some epic humans vs. aliens combat; you picked the wrong movie. There is little of that beyond a few gunfights that are brief. The dogfights are a little entertaining, in my opinion, but that was the extent of entertaining action. This film is more of a disaster movie than an action/adventure. Which was another rare positive point that I will give beyond the mountain of negatives; the disaster aspect of the invasion is pretty cool and appealing to the eye, but that only goes so far. Another gripe I had early on was something I spoke on briefly earlier; the location jumps are overwhelming. Every new scene almost has a caption stating where the scene is taking places. Enough location jumps to give Nightcrawler a headache.You have seen this movie before, folks, its name is 'Independence Day'. If you loved the original so much you can not resist missing out on the sequel that has been twenty years removed. Then by all means, give it your best shot. Otherwise, this film is absolutely juvenile in regards to overdone humor, illogical sequences, and non- linear plots as well as intertwining plots resulting in a underwhelming experience. You are not 'Finding Dory', 'Independence Day: Resurgence'.",Independence Day - Resurgence
220,arturmachado-29588,"This sequel is only a remake but with larger ""everything""",2,19 August 2017,"The first ""Independence Day"" was no work of art, but it was a good entertainment blockbuster with its charm. This sequel is only a remake but with larger weapons, larger ships, larger ET's and CGI everywhere all too obvious like a video game from a decade ago and, of course, much worse performances. The story is basically the same: ET's invade the Earth causing massive destruction, humans infiltrate the mother ship to destroy it from the inside and here appears the only difference - the ET queen was not destroyed because she had an energy shield around her that eventually is destroyed by lesser weapons so that she may be physically injured until her death. A boring movie with unattractive characters with zero charisma played by bad actors full of plot holes that I will not go to the trouble of detailing otherwise I would have to write a book instead of a review. I only give it 2/10 because of the effects, albeit bad. Final Note: The symbol of the African resistance with the five- pointed star and an alien muzzle inside the star is very similar to the symbol of Baphomet that the Illuminati venerate (who puts the face of the enemy in its symbol or flag?) and the whole movie seems to implement the idea of the New World Order agenda.",Independence Day - Resurgence
221,Martinito_08183,"It's the same as the first movie, but way worse than ever.",2,3 November 2019,"The only things that i liked in the movie was the sound and a scene where the character of Liam Hemsworth is taking a piss in front of aliens and while doing that he starts showing a middle finger to them and uses this for a distraction. Aside from that - ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" is a piece of garbage and proves that some movies work way better as a standalone and don't need a sequel at all.Basically: Roland Emmerich takes the things from the first movie that were executed so well and makes they worse. The story, characters, dialogue, acting, cinematography, music and visual effects - all of those aspects were made way worse, than everyone could have imagine. It will go down in history as not only one of the worst sequels out there, but also one of the worst movies of 2016.",Independence Day - Resurgence

It has its classical lines, funny moments, the excitement (not the best but there). Just don't expect a masterpiece.",Independence Day - Resurgence
223,MovieWarfare,A very dumb and inferior sequel,2,4 July 2020,"I enjoyed ""Independence Day (1996)"" even if the movie itself was dumb and silly because, in the end, it was incredibly fun. I was honestly surprised to hear the movie get a sequel 20 years later but the trailers never really pulled me in and all the bad reviews deterred me from giving it a watch myself. Plus Will Smith was not returning due to scheduling conflict with Suicide Squad and they decided to have his character killed off-screen which is annoying. Still, Roland Emmerich who directed the first one was returning for the sequel so it had potential to be good. Anyway since it is independence day I've decided to give the movie a chance and see for myself if the movie was as bad as people say it was.The premise of the movie is that 20 years after the alien invasion, nations across the world started to use recovered extraterrestrial technology to develop an immense defence program. When the alien invaders return and attack with unprecedented force, the U.S. president, teams of scientists and brave fighter pilots spring into action to save the planet from a seemingly invincible enemy.Firstly, I want to praise the concept and idea of this movie. The humans using alien technology and preparing for the next alien invasion is an interesting idea. Shame they don't do much with it but oh well. The destruction in the first act of the movie is cool though and the CGI, in general, is visually impressive.Secondly, I've got to praise the returning actors' Jeff Goldblum, Brent Spiner and Bill Pullman who return as their respective characters from the first movie. Both Jeff, Brent and Bill still give great, charismatic performances despite the really poor script. Experience and veteran actors like Sela Ward as the new president and William Fichtner as space commander are also really good in the film. Liam Hemsworth as ""Jake Morrison"" is one of the few genuinely good new and young actors and is also able to give a somewhat good performance with the bad script.That is all the praise I can give this movie because it is bad and not a good sequel. On the topic of new actors, Jessie Usher as ""Dylan Hiller"" stepson of ""Steven Hiller"", Will Smith's character from the first movie, is terrible. Jessie has no charm or any of the emotional range of Steven Hiller. He never gives any quips like Steven and the moments that are meant to be emotional are not there because Jessie fails to deliver a good performance. It may not necessarily be his fault as the script is atrocious but his character doesn't live up to his father. There is also this Chinese actress Angela Yeung Wing as ""Rain Lao"" who is quite bad as well as she gives a boring performance but then again her character is just written to be a good looking person in the battle. Another reason why this script is really poor. The other new actors do a somewhat decent job but none of them really stand out.I've already mentioned a dozen times but the script is just dumb. A fair amount of lines spouted out by the actors just feel like it was written by a 10-year-old and are not even amusing or funny. A lot of dialogue feel utterly meaningless and add nothing to the movie. One of the charms about the original movie was the quips of Will Smith which even though it was cheesy, it was able to give me a small chuckle. In this movie, it feels like they are trying really hard to get us to laugh with over the top cartooney performance and dumb written dialogue. Unfortunately, it doesn't work and it makes this movie almost a pain to get through.The story in the first movie was dumb and despite the interesting idea in this movie, it is still pretty dumb. Just like the first movie, you are going to have to shut your logic brain because a lot of moments in this movie require you to just believe that can happen. However, the third act in this movie is even more unconvincing and more stupid than the first movie and makes me genuinely believe the aliens are stupid. It also retreads a lot of similar ground to the first movie with destruction first act then attempted but failed mission second act and unconvincing plan but successful third act. It's just the same plot and concept of the first movie but given a new coat of paint and that is lazy.Additionally, the action scenes in this movie are just not as entertaining as the first one. There is a dogfight similar to the first movie but in this case, it is just a cluster of grey CGI spaceships shooting laser beams all over the place with no idea who the good guys and bad guys are. It's just boring and uninspiring. The final fight is also just not that epic and had a lot of incredibly stupid moments.This is a very unsatisfying sequel and is inferior to the first movie in everywhere. Independence day 1996 was dumb but unique and was a really fun experience. However, Independence Day Resurgence is just dumb in general. The movie also has the nerve and audacity to tease a sequel at the end and honestly with its poor box office performance, I am glad that it will never happen. The first movie made an alien invasion exciting, Resurgence makes it forgettable and boring.",Independence Day - Resurgence
224,nmholland,A Very Disappointing Sequel With A Few Good Elements,5,25 June 2016,"Independence Day: Resurgence is directed by Roland Emmerich and takes place 20 years after the original Independence Day, which came out and was set in 1996. In this film, the aliens from the first movie are back, and have brought reinforcements with them. Their technology has improved, and so has their numbers in soldiers. David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) has to work with his old partners son, played by Jessie T. Usher, and a new pilot named Jake Morrison (Liam Hemsworth) in order to stop the aliens from wiping out the human race.I loved the first Independence Day. It's a perfect definition of a fun summer blockbuster. Most of the aspects of that film still hold up today, and it's a film that I, along with many others, cherish even on its twentieth anniversary. However, Independence Day: Resurgence wasn't that good of a movie. There are certain parts of it that are great, but, overall, it's pretty mediocre. I really wanted to like this film, yet I walked out of the theater disappointed.No matter the faults, Independence Day: Resurgence does have two amazing things going for it: Jeff Goldblum and Bill Pullman. These two actors do great as David Levinson and (former) President Whitmore. Their performances are easily the highlight of the film, and provide a very high level of contrast against most of the other actors, who didn't do very well at all.Liam Hemsworth plays one of the biggest characters, that being of Jake Morrison, a pilot who is currently stationed on a moon base. He does, overall, decent in his role, but does nothing special, or even noteworthy. The best thing about his character is the charm that Liam Hemsworth gives through his performance. Other than Hemsworth, however, none of the other actors give even an ""okay"" performance. Jessie T. Usher, playing Dylan Hiller (the son of Will Smith's Steven Hiller), doesn't do that great. His character is, in a way, just there. He doesn't do much, and seems more like a supporting character than a main character that the film is trying to make of him.The biggest character that I took issue with, however, was that of Brent Spiner's Dr. Brakish Okun. I enjoyed this off-his- rocker character in the first Independence Day, but his character is just plain annoying in this film. Rather than being dead, as we presumed him to be at the end of the first film, he was in a twenty- year coma, which was a very cheap move on the writers' parts. The character is given far too much screen time, and really could've been eliminated from the film entirely.The direction, once again by Roland Emmerich, is pretty great. His wide shots of mass destruction are very well taken, and show off the film's special effects is a fantastic way. The effects in Resurgence take after its predecessor, that being amazing, and looking completely believable. Each ship, no matter how big or fast, looks very convincing, and added a sense of threat to the film, which was a good touch.The special effects leads me to the biggest problem this film has, and that's its yearning to do what the original did. Bigger isn't always better. Independence Day: Resurgence tried to do what Independence Day did, except bigger, and that doesn't always work. There's a subplot (that's unnecessary, may I add) about an African tribe that learned about the aliens through a long land battle with a group of them that never left Earth. Why couldn't this film be about that? ""A small African tribe has to stand up against the aliens that were left behind;"" that sounds like a great pitch. But, the writers decided to create an over abundance of new characters, and have them fight an alien ship the size of North America, which wasn't a great idea.The last subject I'll touch on is the pacing of the film, which was fantastic. The two hour movie went by in the blink of an eye, and that really propelled the film forward by a long shot. Before I had even realized it, the credits were rolling, and everyone around me was abandoning their seats, which was a very impressive feat for the filmmakers to do.Overall, Independence Day: Resurgence can be described in one word: disappointing. Bigger isn't synonymous with better, and many filmmakers don't understand that. I'd recommend this film to die hard fans of the original, but I wouldn't suggest spending too much money on seeing it.",Independence Day - Resurgence

226,capelladewdrop,Thought this was a Star Trek movie at first,10,22 June 2016,"Just back from seeing this premier at my local Vue cinema, and it has left me with a glow that one gets from seeing an awesome movie, something which no movie has given me in a long long time.As specified in the title, it played out a bit like a Star Trek movie. I thought I had gone in to see the wrong movie until Jeff Goldblum showed up.It was nowhere near as classic as the original, many of the scenes and speeches given actually being rip offs from the first movie. I started chuckling at the part where President Whitmore got assaulted by the alien. It's something we've seen before why do it again?A bit of a plot hole that I find unforgivable is that in the first movie President Whitmore specifically stated ""They are entire civilisation, moving fom planet to planet."" We destroyed that 'entire civilisation' in 1996 so how can the same aliens return?The CGI was pretty rubbish too. I reckon a lot of the reason I enjoyed this movie was due to the fact I saw it in 3D, something which I have not seen the original in. I was reviewing it as I watched it and I was going to give it 5/10 had it not been for the tear jerking ending.",Independence Day - Resurgence
227,trevor-82944,"Ah, Just Like Old Times!",5,24 June 2016,"Within only two hours, air-crafts from here will join others from around the world. And the second largest aerial battle in this history of mankind will unleash. Despite being 20 years overdue, disaster movie director Roland Emmerich continues his 1996 summer hit.Now with more advanced technology, Independence Day: Resurgence attempts to outdo the Oscar-winning visual effects of the original by adding quadruple the visual effects shots of what the original had. Almost all these effects are done with computers, but it still adds tremendous scale appropriately matching this newly arrived mother ship that took 20 years to improve for the next pursuit. This time, the ship is the size of the entire moon, and not even two decades could prepare our newly changed society for this.Most of the original cast is back in action, and that old mixture of humor and disaster returns with the same nostalgic undertones of the original. There are many calls back to the first movie, and there are numerous subplots that span across the world, also like the original.Although there's nothing as memorable as the shot of the White House getting blown to smithereens, there are still plenty of satisfactory images that can help you to forgive the weak efforts of everything else.It all begins with the alternate 2016 from the world of this film series, where the current president is now a woman. Mankind now has a new meaning, for it took so much to recover from the war of '96. But it's paid off: they now have an international moon base where half-trillion dollar weapons are stationed in case of another invasion. Down in the state of Nevada, Area 51 is established as a grounds where they imprison the aliens. Over in Central Africa, the Rebel Forces now have high-advanced armory, and are working with America to analyze a mother ship that has rested there since the war. These newly established relations suggest how the world is no longer consumed by petty differences, but rather united in common interests.This future is a pretty cool alternate reality, if only the characters lived up to it. Jeff Goldblum is back as the co-lead, and he is doing just about everything you'd expect Jeff Goldblum to do. As for the other stilted actors, Liam Hemsworth plays a new pilot on the moon base, and of course has some sort of love story with the typical female side character. Vivica A. Fox plays a potential love interest for, and I could barely understand her half the time because of her accent. Jessie T. Usher is rather interesting as the son of Captain Hiller, but he mostly reminds us how much better this movie could have been with Will Smith.But the focus isn't on the acting. It's on the intense, horrifying imagery that makes big summer movies so amazing. It's on the cinematic presentation of everyone fighting for their freedom—not from tyranny, oppression, or persecution—but from annihilation. When the mother ship first arrives on Earth, genuine fear is felt as Britain's major monuments burn up in the apocalyptic red smoke, ascending into zero gravity from the impact. Then from there, the mother ship launches its plasma beam into the earth's core through the Atlantic Ocean. It's obviously done with computers, but the shadows the ship makes over the sea makes us terrified for our right to live, to exist.Off in the US, places are flooded, leaving a bunch of possibly orphaned siblings to drive off with another man they rescued from the debris. These little personal elements add to the personal at- home feeling of how doomsday affects the entire world.So sure enough, hundreds—literally hundreds of jets are sent out to fight the mother ship in an overwhelming blizzard of lasers. It's spectacular to watch on a large screen, and may just as well be worth watching in 3D, if you don't mind the overcrowding of things to look at on screen.Although, I wonder if maybe the suspense could have been greater if we never saw the aliens. It's not just that they were the worst special effect in the film, but because they simply did not add much to the enjoyment, and made the film's overall impact less meaningful. But it is still nice to see the turquoise tint of the ship's inside with the aliens' simple design, just like old times.I will admit, Independence Day: Resurgence doesn't quite step it up from the movie we all grew up with. Its attempted message of worldly union is entirely forgotten by the last few moments, making this film go quietly into the night, vanishing without a fight. But guess what else? The attempted message is still true: No matter what nationality we are, we are all one people. We should be united as a world, not putting up walls or voting against the union with another continent. Maybe this movie didn't do it exactly the way it needed to, but its message still needs to be communicated now more than ever, if we wish to live on and survive. I hope we can keep this in mind as we celebrate our Independence Day!Overall Grade: C",Independence Day - Resurgence
228,Paul-271,Sad Sequel Lacks Heart,3,10 July 2016,"The original was a goofy movie but had a great deal of heart and then highly impressive sfx we'd never seen before. All that, especially the heart, made for a blockbuster movie. Oh and let me add characters such as played by Smith, Goldblum and others memorable. This version has none of that which made the first one a landmark movie. The characters are either reiterations such as Goldblum's who's not given enough to do, annoying such as played by the magically resurrected Brent Spiner or tedious such as the vaguely played ex president played by Pullman. The latter spends the first part of the movie disguised as a hamster. None of the characters differentiate themselves from the crowd. None have the power or the spirit to cause us to wish them well. I never was able to tell two the the three female leads apart and only was able to the third because she's Chinese. The plot is incomprehensible in detail. For example, the bad aliens seem to have picked Shanghai up and dropped it on London. Or maybe it picked up more of China (all of East Asia?) and dropped it on more places although at the end, Paris seems OK. There is utterly no rationale behind them doing so other than we get to see Shanghai falling apart and a London Bridge falling down. Along the way we learn that aliens are almost invulnerable to even the advanced firearms of that future time but fall easily to a giant machete wielding Zulu reprising Worf's Star Trek part. In the end the upshot battle pits the foozle against an old school bus full of 8 year olds driven by Judd Hirsch. I'll leave it to you to guess if foozle or bus wins that one.",Independence Day - Resurgence

231,OlieRendch,Roland Emmerich's worst.,5,29 June 2016,"Following the trend of making sequels to blockbusters from decades gone, Independence Day: Resurgence takes place twenty years after the original and brings back one or two of the original cast to play alongside a bunch of newbies at this alien-busting lark. First off, I really enjoy 1996's Independence Day, it's a pure 90s summer movie and a Roland Emmerich classic so I was a little hesitant when hearing of a sequel. But now I've seen it let's go over some things.I'll start, as I always do, with what I liked. I always love an alien movie so I really enjoyed seeing them here. Although a bit underused at times the alien parts of the film were by far the most interesting; they also built on what we already knew about them which was cool to see what they did with that. On the human side of course we have Jeff Goldblum back and he is a welcome sight to any pop culture fan; he delivers one or two memorable lines and in general is just a highlight. Apart from that I unfortunately have to say there isn't really anything else enjoyable about this film.Independence Day: Resurgence is a complete and utter rush from beginning to end. Almost every line of dialogue in the first act was purely expositional. It would cut from one place to another giving you all this information about the world, all these new characters and various things that would go by so quick I didn't have time to get invested. There was no chance to breath, no sooner had it started we were getting huge action sequences and then it would go straight to another. This meant that quite a major piece of new information to this universe went by very abruptly; before I realised what this scene, which in hindsight should have been a bit more impacting, was trying to tell me, we had moved on to set up another action piece.Characters weren't developed at all so I didn't feel anything for them when things happened. There were these three new characters, including Liam Hemsworth and they had this backstory but trying to keep track of everything and not having time to be with these characters I couldn't care less what happened to them; it was like watching strangers from afar. Two other characters were introduced and they were put together as some sort of comedy relief I guess but they fit more into a Pacific Rim sort of film. Now I like Pacific Rim a lot but there is a huge difference between that tone and the tone of the first Independence Day, which is what I was expecting here.The first ID4 was exciting, it had likable characters, it had tense moments. We all remember the aliens being very imposing and threatening; that scene in the operation room showed us that just one could be very powerful but in this sequel they were relegated to mere CGI cannon fodder. Perhaps if this wasn't a sequel; if it was it's own thing, I would have enjoyed it more. But because it is such departure tonally and leaves behind any sort of practical effects for CGI it just felt really rushed and it ended very abruptly trying to get a third film going.In the end Independence Day: Resurgence had a few highlights here and there but this time the king of disaster movies, Roland Emmerich, a man whose work I enjoy (yes, even 2012), has brought just a meaningless, disappointing sequel.",Independence Day - Resurgence

233,pootc,Delivers visually but falls flat,6,25 June 2016,"The sequel to Independence Day delivers visually but story or characters fall flat in what seems like a very rushed and predictable film.20 years have passed since the invasion of earth and the human race has been preparing for another ever since using the same alien technology which was used against them to their advantage. But our enemies have also had twenty years to rethink their strategy. Its time for Round 2.The first film was big for it's time, the shot of the White House being decimated is iconic, and the movie launched Will Smith's career. It was far from a classic in the genre but it was a lot of fun because of Will Smith's character had attitude. ""Welcome to Earth!"" - Bam! In the sequel there is no Will Smith, there is nothing like him. We get his all-American son all grown up from the first movie with most of the cast (who didn't die) returning for smaller roles to make way for the new, younger and sexier cast who are all good enough in their roles but they needed more moments for me to warm to them which is part of the movie's problem - it all seems way too rushed! The comedy in this film made the whole affair seem a lot more lighthearted than it should have and while the original had it's light moments, one of the characters was simply there to provide comic relief and could have easily been written out to make way for more character care.The sequel has some good ideas such as humankind's use of the technology they have received at the hands of the invaders. It further adds to the invaders plans and explains more of their history but it's not fleshed out enough and borrows too much from another certain Alien franchise (with a Queen) which really rubbed me the wrong way. It just wasn't very original in the end.All in all, its a tall task to be completely original. We have seen the destruction of cities so many times now but I thought this could have been a lot better. It leaves the door way, way open for a sequel. The ending practically guarantee's it.",Independence Day - Resurgence
234,arnieiam,"This isn't as fun as ID4, but it still is harmless, mindless popcorn fare",8,25 June 2016,"I remember Independence Day and how huge it was. It is one of the defining blockbusters of the 90s and that decade had only a few (Jurassic Park, Titanic and Phantom Menace are what I can think of immediately). Now in the 2010s there is a massive hit almost every month. ID4 wasn't a culturally significant film in the sense of Schindler's List, but it is still known as being the quintessential popcorn flick. And I think that is what Roland Emmerich is good at.There are some comparisons you can make with Roland and Michael Bay but I think Roland is a competent director. He does not engage in harmful ethnic stereotypes or female objectification or low brow humour like Bay. And I'll say this: Roland can handle an ensemble cast WAY BETTER than Bryan Singer and give them their proper screen time.Now with this long awaited sequel, 20 years to be exact, how does it hold up to the original? It doesn't. But that does not mean I hated it. I thought it was fun for what it was.Let me get into what I disliked first. No Will Smith. Ohh man how I missed the Fresh Prince in this movie (he better kill it on Suicide Squad). So the film basically lacked the charm of the original. I'm glad Jeff Goldblum was there in all his eccentricity, I love the guy. So was Bill Pullman who gave a very inspiring monologue in the third act. Brent Spiner returns as Dr. Okun waking up from a 20-year coma apparently and he has a bigger part this time. But it is the younger cast which I wasn't too fond of. Liam Hemsworth is OK but he is oddly enough a poor man's Chris Hemsworth. The guy playing Will Smith's son was such a terrible wooden actor - Oh why Fresh Prince were you not in this?! There is another young cast member who was just annoying, I don't know his name but he plays Liam's wing-man. There was also some really stilted expository dialogue that plagued the movie's first act. And the plot did not fit the 3 act structure that well of the first film. It takes a while for the aliens to begin invading and then it tries to rush into the final battle. There were still characters being introduced well into the second act. You see tertiary characters die that we were supposed to be emotionally invested in but no proper screen time was given to them. Like any major blockbuster film in the 2010s the climax is hyperactive with many simultaneous things being cross cut together. And like a film of the 2010s there is a lot of really ugly, glossy CGI, which made me yearn for the practical models in the original.So what did I like? A lot of things actually. First off it built from the original. It did not rehash plot elements (*cough*Force Awakens*cough*) and in fact, unexpectedly built on the mythology. You saw from the trailers how Earth took the alien technology and appropriated it for themselves, so it delves into a futuristic almost space operatic sci-fi film compared to a straight up alien invasion film the original was. On top of the original characters learning from their previous experiences, almost every character goes through a satisfying-ish story arc.But what I enjoyed the most is that it still tries to maintain the optimistic tone of the original. I still haven't decided whether is succeeded or failed. For now I think it did a good job. There is a lot of destruction but it is presented as a spectacle rather than in a gloomy way. We have seen all these big budget films that try to recreate 9/11 imagery (*cough*Man of Steel*cough*) that it was kind of refreshing to just see mindless destruction again without taking itself too seriously.So is ID4 1996 the superior film? Yes. But is this sequel a disappointment? I don't think so. To each their own. I'm OK with Roland Emmerich. His films are stupid but they're not offensive. And he doesn't look down on his audience. So yeah, it should be an enjoyable experience in the end.",Independence Day - Resurgence

This movie had none of the heart or emotional impact of the first, nor even (with two decades' advances in technology) the exciting CGI of the original. Jeff Goldblum, Judd Hirsch, and Bill Pullman, saddled with terrible scripts, seemed to be doing only parodies of their reprised characters, while Will Smith wisely skipped the project. Vivica Fox has STILL not learned to act, but mercifully, was on screen only briefly. The rest of the forgettable cast, mostly nobodies (and those who deserve to be, like Liam Hemsworth) were just awful.It is being reported that Emmerich blames the twenty-year delay in this movie on --no kidding-- George W.

239,jmmustchin,Bigger and badder,8,2 November 2018,"Independence Day: Resurgence isn't as good as the original Independence Day, but it's bigger, badder, and a hell of a lot of fun! It's also more intense, and less suitable for children, than the first.Resurgence is set 20 years after the first film. Earth's technology has greatly advanced - mainly be reverse-engineering the alien technology from the first film. A system of defences has been set up to prevent a future alien attack.On the 4th of July, the defence base on one of Jupiter's moons disappears as what appears to be a wormhole appears next to it. Shortly afterwards, a similar wormhole appears next to the moon defence base, and a giant spherical craft emerges. The world leaders shoot it down - despite David Levinson's warnings that it wasn't the race that attacked them (referred to as the Harvesters). Jake Morrison, a soldier on the moon base & friend of Levinsons, steals a small ship, picks up Levinson and some others from earth, and heads to the down alien craft. Just as they retrieve it, a 3000 mile wide spaceship materialises and proceeds to wipe out all of Earth's defences with total impunity. It then proceeds to land over the Atlantic, destroying numerous cities. It then proceeds to drill towards the Earth's core - and if successful, and they successfully siphon it out, first our magnetic field will disappear, followed by the atmosphere, and earth will become a dead planet inhospitable for life.You can guess the plot of the rest of the movie. Humanity - what remains of it - scrambles to try and repel the alien invasion before it's too late, while at the same time Dr Okun tries to work out the sphere that arrived in the spherical ship. (THAT's an interesting subplot - although I won't spoil how.)I love the movie. I love the plot, the action, the special effects, and the broader universe and story arc created.

Resurgence is such an insult to logic, science and basic knowledge that I truly believe the whole movie crew, director, actors, producers, etc should apologize to the SciFi community and really consider stay away from making SciFi movies ever again. There isn't one single minute during this horrific mockery of a movie when sheer ignorance and stupidity aren't present at mesmerizing and unprecedented magnitude.

This is definitely a sequel to Independence Day as the effort to remain the ridiculous science, cheesy but hilarious dialogues, patriotism and unity to defense the world against aliens invasion; of all its many flaws, that's the type of fun that triggers part but not entirely, the classic entertainment values of its predecessor. Although the absence of Will Smith and introduction of new young characters seems a bit less convincing due to the formulaic plot and thin character development, the film reunites a number of casts from 20 years ago, including Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman and Brent Spiner who still deliver to further enhance the enjoyment of this popcorn flick. The scores, composed by both Harald Kloser/ Thomas Wander seems to be better than their previous works and follows Zimmer's style to be loud while the stunning visual effects are nothing less than those in ""The Day After Tomorrow"" and ""2012"" which would definitely attract audiences who enjoy to catch the moments of blowing stuffs up.

243,dinalt10,Massive disappointment,1,31 July 2016,"The original was never a classic film, but it was (and still is) a guilty pleasure of mine. The science is daft, the film's corny and there's way too much US of A.But the original in 1996 had a great cast, some memorable lines and of course the presidents speech.Fast forward 20 years, and this is a stinking turd of a film. Honestly, there have been 2 decades to write a sequel (that didn't need making), and this is the best they can do ? This is one of the few films I've walked out of halfway through, so I don't know whether the film improved at all.With the exception of 1 or 2 characters, everyone else in this film is boring, wooden and not worth screen time.And therein lies the problem. Great effects don't make for a great film, and certainly can't disguise a poorly written script.The original film had you rooting for the characters (corny as some scenes were). And when the president decides to 'nuke the bastards', the cinema erupted with cries of yes.The sequel just doesn't involve you in the characters, which seems to be a massive problem with Hollywood these days. If you don't care about the characters, then the film has no purpose.And when you don't care about the characters, the massive mistakes are all too apparent. Someone wakes from a coma and starts walking straight away being a prime example.I really hope there isn't an ID3, as poor sequels serve only to cheapen the original.And I've read rumours that the same team have been asked to 'reboot' Stargate. The original was their film, and although corny, I enjoyed it.If ID2 is anything to go by, I really hope they don't get anywhere near Stargate.

The stupid part was that the door should have been closed to block the young characters who were portrayed by Liam Hemsworth, Angelababy, Jessie T. Usher, and Maika Monroe from being able to escape since the aliens were not supposed to be primitive like the humans and have everything planned out to make them, the humans, even more unable to get away from their fate.

245,dutchs-1,Better than I expected but still huge plot holes.,7,7 July 2016,"What's bigger than a spaceship that can span continents? Some of the plot holes in this movie. For one thing, why did they rebuild the Capitol building so ugly? More importantly, when one of the alien ships from 1996 landed (the only one), and an African warlord spent years defeating the aliens, why didn't the rest of the world pitch in? Why did he refuse to allow access to the ship for no sensible reason? When the mother ship from 1996 sent out a signal, why didn't people figure out immediately it was a distress call? The other alien ships all crashed and burned, true, but there should have been plenty to salvage from them. Why weren't all the world's linguists swarming all over trying to decipher the alien language? Why wasn't every physicist on earth working on learning the aliens' physics? Why wasn't every intelligence operative on earth working to figure out where the aliens came from? Why doesn't every university have an alienology program?Oh, Area 51 now has a hospital named after the President's wife from the first movie. Sort of a consolation prize for having a huge science complex and zero equipment or personnel to perform surgery.The movie opens with characters being introduced and defined briskly. An alien ship appears over the moon and is shot down. It turns out not to be from the bad guy aliens, but contains an artificial intelligence that fortunately doesn't carry a grudge. The real alien ship turns up soon after and, for reasons never explained, picks up Dubai and dumps it on London. Then it gets silly. The idea that the aliens would need a ship 3000 miles across is stupid beyond words. The alien ship starts boring into the earth to reach the core, which it supposedly uses to power its ships. Why any old molten iron won't do, and why Earth's core as opposed to, say, Venus, is never explained. It turns out the aliens want the artificial intelligence, which holds the key to the only thing that can threaten them. And the aliens are a hive mind with a queen. Except when we see her, she isn't a shapeless, helpless grub, she's more like the Cloverfield monster, a lean, mean, queen machine. We kill the queen and the alien ship departs, summoned back by other alien queens. There's a strong hint we'll have a sequel. We're told that the artificial intelligence holds the key to interstellar travel. Now wait a minute. You've had alien ships for twenty years, plus the debris from the mother ship, much of which is still in space. You mean nobody tried to figure out their drives in all that time? This movie gets an NOSW rating - No Other Scientists in the World. In an NOSW film, there are maybe three scientists in the whole world working on key problems, and the rest are, what? Chasing coeds?

This movie however barely tries. It is so un-original as it features the same old plot of Aliens with superior technology totally getting the humans screwed, and then the humans try their best to fight back. This makes the movie entirely predictable from beginning to end. It also features too much action, which makes the movie boring. It got so tiresome and boring that I almost walked out of the theater. I might not like the dull plot of Blade Runner, but at least it was original. This however is a copycat story that overall fails to excite and is predictable.Like a lot of action flicks, the characters in this movie are not likable, dull, generic, and one dimensional. The actors did not do a very good job portraying them. Like, there's a 2 bland heroes each having a bland love interest. None of them have a personality. Because of this, you can't feel sorry for anybody. Plus, the villains (the aliens) don't even have much lines. They are all just so forgettable.I have hit this movie very hard, so I now have some positive things to say. The special effects are pretty decent, but the CG overload doesn't really work, it just feels too artificial, unlike the Jungle Book's CG, which felt more real. Also the humor in this movie is a mixed bag. There are some funny jokes that did make me laugh, but there were some weak ones that got a chuckle, but weren't memorable.So overall, if you do want to watch a movie, Finding Dory is a much better option. In this movie however, the writing is abysmal, and the characters have no personality. It is also boring, and very predictable. For the 4th of July, (the US independence day) watching this would be a complete waste of time. Save your money, and watch the fireworks on the 4th of evening.

Making the sequel to one of the most ironically entertaining action blockbusters of all time 20 years apart and without the irony leaves any sort of review out the window in favor of ""well what did you expect?"". The original Independence Day wasn't the most layered or the most nuanced of movies about killer aliens, but it knew what it wanted to be and succeeded on that front – a tongue-in-cheek action romp based on memorable one-liners, goofy characters, and the blatant notion of global teamwork against our adversaries. Cheesy and clichéd as it may be but in the earnest and awesome way possible. Resurgence, on the other hand, sacrifices the cheese in favor of grander spectacle and higher stakes, all paradoxically decrementing the film into the blandest type of dumb action movies imaginable. Heck, there's not much to the story outside of a blatant upgrade (using this term LOOSELY) of the last movie; in the aftermath of the battle against the aliens, society has upgraded themselves in the off chance that the aliens might invade once again. Wouldn't you know it, the aliens invade again, only stronger and advanced and yadda, yadda, yadda. Oh, and Jeff Goldblum and Charlotte Gainsbourg discovers a new breed of aliens (which looks like Marvin's head from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) who were once at war with the same species and is ultimately used as bait for the aliens so there would be the big final blowout. There's old cameos, a young actor trying to fill in Will Smith shoes, new actors, and all the big, dumb Roland Emmerich spectacle that you're probably tired of at this point. What's sorely missing is the irony, where all the goodwill and heart the first movie originated. Call it a symptom of sequel-itis (where the second movie needs to be darker and high in risks than the first one in some vain attempt to progress the story), but it just leaves the film A: no more that the countless other dull, dreary sci-fi movies, and B: looking more brainless during when it's taking itself more seriously. Character introductions and plot setups feel rushed and utterly unengaging, destruction set pieces alters between menacing and insanely convenient, and what little forward story momentum in the film gets cut by awkwardly edited detours. All of this would've been part of the charm, or in the very least uplifted by the same confidence of teamwork like the last movie, had Resurgence salvaged any charm in the first place. Even if I don't care much for Roland Emmerich's other movies, all I ask for this guy is to not take his work seriously. Anonymous, Stonewall, and even 10,000 BC show the worst of his vision, where his poor delusions of self-importance get the best out of his otherwise worthwhile material. Yet, here he's at it again bringing the same dreary work in a sequel to a film that defies anything serious. He had a chance to enlighten us again, and he blew it.

250,hi_im_manic,A weak followup. The mozzarella of movies.,5,8 July 2016,"4.5 stars. The original Independence Day literally blew us away with its cutting edge graphics, appropriate use of CGI, well-paced action and immense destruction. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about I.D.: Resurgence. It's an oddball mish-mash of elements largely borrowed from other sci-fi films. Whilst not a total stinker, it's a sequel awful enough that it is a disgrace to the original. The more you enjoyed the original the more disappointed this one will leave you. It is about as satisfying as watching The Fifth Wave, and somewhat less enjoyable than San Andreas. The story picks up 20 years after the world successfully united to defend earth from alien invasion and the elimination of mankind. Peoples of the earth live far more harmoniously with one another, technology has advanced immensely, and space travel (primarily to the moon) is a regularity. The new POTUS is a woman who doesn't hesitate to take the offensive against potential threats. Her character is completely unnecessary though and should have either been eliminated. There are a total of 3 presidential figures in this movie! Sheesh! There are just too many irrelevant characters doing irrelevant things. The primary weapon used by the invaders is somewhat unique, and the ""mothership"" is said to be the size of the Atlantic ocean. There's an excess of fight flights, it's difficult to tell what's happening. ""Area 51"" is referred to at least 16 times, which was truly cheese. Couldn't focus be on another mysterious location on earth? One character has amazingly been in a coma since 1996, but suddenly awakens when the earth is again threatened. Every one of our military ""hero figures"" has one or more deceased parent from the first attack against earth. It's clear that Will Smith was largely responsible for the success of the first film. He's sorely missed in this one, but no one can blame him for passing on it! It certainly wouldn't help his career. Jada Pinkett Smith does return to her role, though her part is little more than a cameo. This movies lacks originality, charisma, rhythm, thrills, likable characters, continuity and a sensible story-line.

251,benoyum111,This films are made only for one reason!,1,30 November 2019,"This two films are trying to impose us this thought: 'There can be an alien attack and all nations should come together and fight together.' The first film was better, because it was the first film that is made that gives this message. And this second film is just a bigger version imposing us the same thought.
This 'Let's unite' thought sounds good but actually it is not. With this thought that USA gives, they want all the powers of the nations want to be controlled in on hand, and they want to control it. We humans should be their workers and the rulers will control us all.
Now, how the world is, the conflict between nations and different religions, makes it hard to control. So they try everything for the world to be ruled from one center and this outer earth alien attack is a good idea. I persionally think that it is the only idea they have. So with all their big movies, they are imposing this on us.
If you don't believe me, look all the sci-fi or superhero movies that they made since 20-30 years. Almost all these movies give us the same idea: Aliens might attack, aliens might attack, we should unite, we should spend all our money to army, to technology, to space investment. We people should only work for this.
So they are not making movies anymore like E.T. or friendly aliens. (Maybe there is few exceptions that I don't know, but they are not big movies for sure)Go do your own research. This movies are just brain-washing and their only intent is to put some thoughts in our minds.
This uniting nations and peace idea is fake. You can see this in their movies, Americans always saving the Earth and they just put few other characters from other Nations to show that, all nations should work with USA...

255,anthonymichaelbangert,"Enjoyable, But Bad",5,1 July 2016,"Independence Day: Resurgence is the sequel to 1996's cult sci-fi film Independence Day. I'd like to start off by saying this film is 20 years too late. But still, it's here, and I forced myself to see it. So, we are 20 years into the future. Humanity has not had conflict because they all are united because aliens. Yet there are warlords. Okay. The people of Earth have created advanced weaponry by combining the leftover alien technology with their own. Everything seems okay. Until the aliens come back with a bigger ship with its own gravitational pull and basically lands on earth without completely destroying it with the the obvious gravitational problem, except for certain areas (ie: not America, where people matter). All your favorite characters are back, like uh, um, uh, Jeff Goldblum. And obviously dead in the first one mad scientist guy played by Brent Spiner. And replacement for crazy old guy: crazy old President, played by Bill Pullman. And Jewish dad,who contributes nothing to the story (just like the first time). And President's daughter, played by not Mae Whitman (because she doesn't fit standard beauty requirements, I guess?) And we also have new characters, like Will Smith's son played by not Will Smith. And Liam Hemsworth playing the same dude from every other movie he's in. Also, this movie features kids in danger because nothing spells tension like the kids in danger, even if they are shoehorned into the movie. Yeah, this movie has a lot of characters. I didn't even name them all. Anyway, the humans have to beat the aliens again and they learn stuff about them at the same time. Unfortunately, this movie just didn't deliver. It felt like a cheap knock off of all modern sci-fi flicks. It followed EVERY sci-fi movie cliché ever. It also felt like a badly made video game, complete with a friggin boss fight. The acting was stilted by most, though Jeff Goldblum and Bill Pullman seemed to be trying. Many of the performances were over the top, like the actors were trying to be comedic, but just ended up being annoying. The battle scenes had so much going on on the screen, it was impossible to tell what was going on half the time. Sort of like watching Transformers fight in a Michael Bay movie. And yet, through it all, though this movie was complete garbage, I can't hate it. It was enjoyable. Stupid? Yes. Bad? Yes. But so was Independence Day. Seriously, go re-watch that film without Nostalgia Goggles on. You're gonna notice something. It's not good. But it is so enjoyable anyway. See, in today's society, we have 2 choices. Love or Hate. There is no in between. But I say that should be changed. Some of my favorite films aren't good. But they entertain me. And that's what movies are designed for. Sure, there are some that are absolutely fantastic that'll stay in our minds forever. And there are some that are so bad that they should never see the light of day. But there are those inbetweeners. Sometimes we just want one that'll take our minds on a fun a ride for 2 hours. And that is the Independence Day films. I'd give this film a 5/10. Go watch it for a fun time. But don't expect anything good. P.S. Screw the ending. *No Spoilers* but they basically threw a gigantic sign in our face that said ID4:3: Coming Soon. Ugh.",Independence Day - Resurgence

257,Essex_Rider,Oh Dear!,3,6 November 2016,"Ignoring the fact that a giant spacecraft settles on the surface of the planet and the orbit isn't affected or the atmosphere displaced, this is just plain awful. Bill Pullman was so wooden I think make up must have used fencing paint. The sphere that contains details of an intergalactic war! Come on, really? The script was hokey, the delivery was so cheesy I could almost smell it. The imprisoned aliens looking more like they'd emigrated from the movie 'Aliens'. The whole thing was so disappointing I think it's up there with Battlefield Earth. Scale played a part in the overall stupidity. A 3000 mile wide spacecraft? Yeah right!",Independence Day - Resurgence
258,bartonj2410,I've never missed Will Smith so much before!!!,4,24 June 2016,"I went into Independence Day: Resurgence with my brain well and truly switched off. A sequel to one of my favourite films was always going to attract my attention but I was always a bit cautious as this film arrives a full twenty years after the first film.It turns out I was right to be cautious about this film because Independence Day: Resurgence really is quite rubbish. My expectations weren't high by any means but I certainly couldn't help but feel a bit deflated when I left the cinema. Twenty years to make a sequel and this is seriously the best they could do?!In the twenty years that have passed since the events in the first film, Earth has used the leftover alien technologies to create the Earth Space Defence (ESD), a united global defence program that serves as an early warning system in case of any more attacks. It's an Earth that has seen humanity united and war free for twenty years.When a much bigger threat than before arrives in Earth's atmosphere, it's not long before the ESD is well and truly tested. Humanity was able to stave off the threat once before but would they find themselves out of luck when the aliens return bigger and intent on destroying the planet?I have to say it's quite a noble effort from Roland Emmerich to make a sequel that attempts to evolve from its predecessor. The idea of the alien technology left over from the invasion of 1996 being used to enhance Earth's defence from further attacks is one that stops the film from feeling like a carbon copy of Independence Day. There are a few more elements in the plot that do this as well but I can't discuss them without spoiling the film so I'll leave those for you to discover for yourself.It's the rest of the story and the script that leaves a hell of a lot to be desired. Now, the first film is ridiculously cheesy however, this sequel takes it to almost unbearable heights with an incredibly rushed story and rather dull script. There's no effort made to break up action sequences with some low-key scenes between characters like the first film did so well. Instead, they opt for the lay down the story and character introductions in the first half hour and then go balls out crazy when the aliens show up until the end of the film.When I say balls out crazy I really do mean it. The last hour and a half is literally just a destruction montage but not necessarily the good kind. The special effects are very impressive and there are certainly moments that I had fun with however, even with my brain switched off, I eventually got a little fed up of it all. It all just lacks the swagger and grandeur the first film possessed.As for the performances, Independence Day: Resurgence misses the charisma of someone like Will Smith much more than I thought it would. Think Liam Hemsworth or Jessie T. Usher have the charisma to be a replacement? Think again. Hemsworth faces a career spent entirely in the shadow of his brother, Chris, unless he starts putting in some decent performances while Usher is totally void of any emotion in his performance.Jeff Goldblum tries his hardest but he ultimately ends up looking lost amongst the mess that this film eventually becomes and Bill Pullman very much hams it up as the President who led the resistance back in 1996 but now experiences visions of a pending attack. Judd Hirsch also returns but in a totally unnecessary subplot that makes it seem like it was a last minute decision just to give him something to do. Oh, and Sela Ward stars as the current President but she's barely worth mentioning and you'll understand why when you see the film.The film culminates in an unsatisfying finale that possesses one of the most sequel baiting final scenes you will ever see. I pretty much hated the final scene and I didn't really want to hate any of this film. I know I've already said that my brain was switched off as soon as I sat down in the cinema however, there's no escaping the fact that, with twenty years to prepare, Independence Day: Resurgence should have been so much better.",Independence Day - Resurgence
259,roondogbb,This movie shouldn't have been made.,4,26 May 2021,"The first independence day movie was excellent and the epitome of a great summer blockbuster. It was a well written tale of an alien invasion of earth, with great characters portrayed by brilliant actors that the audience cared about... Insurgence has none of this.The direction that the creators of this sequel went with was to massively increase special effects, become a little too self referential, add many new characters alongside the old characters from the 1996 movie into the very weak B plots. How can these writers expect the audience to care for the outcomee of these hallow under developed people? Its lazy. Even the characters that were in the previous movie, such as Captain Hiller's wife....... come's and goes, like a disposable plastic cup, without creating an emotional reaction (from me at least) and I loved her in the first movie. Where she had a lot more screen time.This movie is also obviously playing up to certain international markets, adding in a Chinese general and his niece as a pilot, again there is no warmth to these characters and their relationship they had very little interaction and little growth together on screen. So when something bad happens, the writers are expecting an emotional reaction from the audience which isn't deserved.Also the movie has way to much CGI. Maybe its easier than the practical type special effects but it changes the feel of the movie.The story itself becomes very convoluted because in the original independence day movie it was indicated that the entire species travelled in the one mother ship. So then story was somehow shifted to, they had many large ""mother ships"" and the one that got destroyed was but one of many. The movie also had too much exposition to explain what's had been happening over 20 years to try to fill in story gaps.So I wouldn't recommended watching it. I would give it a 4. Since its interesting to see a few character's again other than that nothing would draw me in to see it. What they should have gone for in my opinion was a series of movies which built up the universe. Perhaps one movie looks at the ground war that occured in Africa. Another one that looked into rebuilding the world (all the while creating characters with much more time) eventually you have that interstellar war which is the pay off. Much like before each avengers movie there is a series of other movies that adds to one's investment in the universe. And truely there is a lot of ideas that could be looked into. A cartoon series perhaps. The ground war as mentioned. The rebuilding etc.",Independence Day - Resurgence
260,picturetaker,ID4-2 Nitpicks and Observations,1,20 March 2017,"Watched this ID4-2 tonight. It was so horrible I took notes to publish on IMDb and other places. Here are my nitpicks and observations. They act so casual in everything they do. From Liam Hemsworth complaining about moving a huge space weapon like its an every day thing to Jeff Goldbloom in Africa just walking around not noticing a giant hole in the ground. When the aliens show up there is no stress or worry in anyone of note voices, emotions and appearance. Its just business as usual for Lady President and company. Like seriously everyone is too casual throughout the entire movie!For political reasons the President was made an empowering woman in a movie prior to the USA election with Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. This was confirmed by the writers.The technology was integrated far too quickly in all applications except personal computers. The Laptops while current in our 2016 are obsolete with the Alien technology used in all other applications. Or perhaps Dell just didn't try to acquire any interface? How did we reverse engineer their technology so quickly anyways? It likely would be based on elements and science we'd have no understanding of and just because we have it doesn't mean we can use it.The Alien spaceship flies way way too close to the moon. Like practically scrapes it. This of course has no impact on its orbit.There is basically world peace however the United States seems to control the orbital weapon satellites? And China seems to an invited partner. And the rest of the world just seems OK with this?The alien ship is so big with a diameter of 3000 miles and 20x bigger than the 1996 ships. That the weight would likely weigh as much as the moon. Even if the moon had a controlled landing on Earth. The weight would be enough to destroy the orbit and rotation of the earth and it being well past the height of the atmosphere it would likely destroy the atmosphere also. The ship is way too big.A 1980's Caprice Classic Station Wagons as great as they were had a muffler that was about 6"" from the pavement. It couldn't drive for long under at least a foot of water as we see the kids driving through a Tsunami soaked area.The attack on the alien ship just seemed weak and boring.The Aliens apparently breach a bunker know as Cheyenne Mountain. This a deep level bunker that is holding the president deep underground. The aliens walk in as if its on the ground. No battle. No video battle. Just one moment they land the next the president says ""there will be no peace"" as the Aliens enter. They all die. How? Self destruct? Aliens? We just don't know.It was awesome to see the Aliens on their ship however none of their technology should be any different than it was 20 years earlier in 1996 however it seems as if they have upgraded also. This makes no sense as their civilization is probably a million years old.At one point they steal some Alien fighters. My question is how as they were very clearly taken over by the control tower in the original movie yet now they can not only steal them but also dog fight in them like they've flown in them before. After they escape they fly casually as if there is no more threat. Except clearly the big ship has weapons that could blow them out of the sky. The Queen Alien surviving a close detonation of multiple fusion detonation because she has her own shield is just plain convenient. Too convenient. Her having a huge gun is even more so convenient.The queen has the ability to take control of the fighter ships. Yet when the two hijacked alien fighter ships are attacking her she doesn't crash those ones to the ground. Later the queen takes over all the fighter ships including the ones hijacked to make a protective swarm. They are then able to turn on the Thrusters to some how escape her control. Then they fly back down and start shooting her and she doesn't have the swarm to protect her? At the end the massive Alien ship takes off. With out a Queen? We know that the soldier aliens don't die when she dies as they fought them for 10 years in Africa after the 1996 one was destroyed. But they stop drilling and working when she dies? If they have the ability to take off in this Alien ship then why do they also not have the ability to attack Earth and seek vengeance? Why not self destruct?The ending is worthy of an original Star Trek episode where they all stand around and laugh. Instead it ends with a clear assumption that there will be a sequel and that they will bring the fight to them. Its possible that the ending is the worst part of it. It quickly ends instead of a few minutes more say 1 year later where we see the devastation of the attack. Learn a death toll. Basically a mention of whatever happened during the entire movie. Thats it. I am sure I missed some more things as I wrote these nitpicks and observations. But I think this is enough. Check out my other reviews.",Independence Day - Resurgence

263,varnium,Spectacular Idea but Poor Result,5,21 September 2016,"The idea of the movie is outstanding. After humans defeated the first alien invasion, humans begin to adopt alien technology. Then after 20 years, humans created anti-gravity vehicles along with many gigantic laser cannons around the world. The coolest one was the orbital defense system. A term similar to the one in old PC game called Alpha Centauri.The second alien invasion begin but with more massive scale. This time, it's so enormous that it covers half of the Atlantic Ocean and has it's own gravity. The special effects were stunning. Character building from the beginning of the movie is quite good. But from the middle to the end of the movie, it just went terribly wrong.The worst part of the movie is when the alien queen decides too separate itself from the mothership to pursue an ancient alien artifact. Come on! Aliens are so intelligent that they had to make the most idiot decision in the universe??If they're supremely intelligent, the queen wouldn't need to separate itself and get defeated by humans. Instead it will send millions of it's minions to do the hard work. After all, the mothership is so formidable that it can obliterate any civilization quickly. Why not do so instead?Why not just let the aliens win for once in while? Why do protagonist in movies always win despite impossible odds? By doing so, it just make people realize how stupid the creator of the story is. If it's impossible, then it should be impossible. Leave it at that.If the aliens had won and every aspect of human civilization was destroyed, then it would have been a better movie, because it's a lot more reasonable. It'll be an apocalyptic scifi movie at its best!",Independence Day - Resurgence

Once again, July 4th becomes an anniversary of a bloody battle for survival. ""Today, we celebrate our Independence Day!""Sadly, some of the best parts are the references, both subtle and overt, to the previous film. The opening credits give us a choppy radio rehash of that famous speech cut over footage of the alien queen discovering that one of the ships from ""the War of '96"" sent a distress call. This time, it's personal.Recall Star Wars Episode 7, when we find out that Starkiller Base is like the Death Star only bigger. That's basically the entire premise of this film. This time, the alien mothership is so big, it has its own gravitational pull, picking up whole cities and dropping them on others.There has been some major overhauls of Earth's technology from the wreckage of the first wave's ships, but it seems it doesn't help all that much (was it too much to put shields on our fancy space fighters?), and it is through this fancy technology that we meet the new cast.Now, the acting from either the old returning faces or the new faces is not bad, it's just they're forced to say some terrible dialogue which makes them seem bad. Aside from the return of Dr. Okun (Brent Spiner), there's Dylan Hiller (Jessie Usher), the stepson of Will Smith's character all grown up and following in his stepfather's footsteps, Jake Morrison (Liam Hemsworth), a fellow pilot with history with Hiller and banished to the moon base, Patricia Whitmore (Maika Monroe), the grown daughter of former President Whitmore, and finally, in an utterly blatant attempt to curry favor with Chinese audiences, we see Lt. Rain Lao (Angelababy), a Chinese fighter pilot with a shallow backstory, ill-defined relationship with a sort-of-important- but-not-really character who's killed, and generally hangs around the other pilot characters with absolutely no impact on the plot except to serve as a really weird love interest for another side character.In all, this film's plot is basically exactly like the original's, which is fine. It's an entertaining action flick which serves as a passing-the-torch to a new generation of characters. There's nothing wrong with this.The problem, though, is that we had to wait 20 years for a sequel to a truly amazing film which was sold as bigger and better. We got bigger, but as for better... eesh, not really, which makes this film both decent and disappointing.",Independence Day - Resurgence

Somehow, though, the sequel found a way to COMPLETELY mess it up.Independence Day: Resurgence is a disgrace to both its franchise, Roland Emmerich's career, and the ENTIRE sci-fi genre. While it may benefit from decent visual effects, that CANNOT save itself from the obvious lack of direction and horrible writing that delivers a bland and unoriginal story, a despicable tone, generic characters, and stale action scenes that don't fix anything. But thanks to a twist about a bigger universe that actually makes its problems much worse, this ends up DESTROYING what's left of the picture. If I gotta be honest, just don't bother with this one. Watch the fireworks instead or just stick with the original. But this film is not just soulless and corproate, but also a shining sign of how not EVERYTHING deserves a sequel.",Independence Day - Resurgence
266,martijn-56,Spectacular Sci-fi - why all the hatred?,8,2 July 2016,"Any movie sequel has the impossible task to expand on what was done well in the original one, without getting too repetitive - and at the same time showing new stuff, but also not too much change in order to stay true to the mood of the original. After reading all the bad reviews I actually was worried I would be in for a big disappointment after seeing the first one in 1996 which I remember like it was yesterday. I am happy to say I was pleasantly surprised - except for character development, Emmerich did everything that was great in the first one better and even more spectacular this time. True, I missed the unlikely but great chemistry between Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum in this sequel, so I can see why some reviewers feel Independence Day Resurgence lacks a bit of soul, but I guess this feeling is mostly due to the fact that people do not like change. Many of the great characters of the first one (Bill Pullman as ex President, Brent Spiner as the 'mad professor', Jeff Goldblum and Judd Hirsch) were back with some new interesting actors, too (Sela Ward, Charlotte Gainsbourg, William Fichtner). And besides insane special effects, Emmerich also always makes sure there are some humorous and light moments, too, and this sequel was no exception. Many reviewers complained about too much stuff being crammed in this movie. Well, I was entertained for two hours and the movie did not feel rushed to me. Still, I do agree that the first movie made you care more about the characters and what was at stake for the universe if mankind and love would not see the light of day, shown by e.g. the romance of Jeff Goldblum and his ex wife intertwining with the marriage of the characters played by Will Smith's and Vivica Fox. That, with the moment of deepest despair, followed by hope (the virus idea) and sacrifice by a drunk flying his ship into a laser beam followed by one of the most spectacular explosions in any movie, gave a cheering feeling that this sequel did not manage to equal, let alone surpass. I hope 20th Century Fox will give Emmerich more time for character development in the third installment, though, which I hope we will see before an other 20 years pass by!Still, this was a sequel that also gave us a lot of new interesting stuff to see (I won't go into spoilers) and the movie is well worth the admission ticket. Furthermore, the story line has a lot of similarities to the first one, but also offers interesting opportunities for a third installment, which will probably a sort of Independence Day Goes Interstellar thing - I can't wait! Go and see it in 3D!",Independence Day - Resurgence
267,thedukeofmovietown,How late IS this movie?,4,31 October 2016,"Somebody alert the press! Independence Day got itself a sequel. I don't know where the studio brass' collective heads were when they green-lit this movie but my best guess is that they took a jump to the left out of a time warp. Never the less, everyone's favorite Sunday afternoon movie is back with a new chapter starring Jeff Goldblum and Bill Pullman reprising their roles as David and President Whitmore along side Liam Hemsworth, Jessie T. Usher who plays the son of the absent Will Smith's character and Maika Monroe as Whitmore's daughter. Also returning are Brent Spiner and the incomparable Judd Hirsche as David's father Julius. In short everyone is here to take on another swing at the alien menace who in response to their defeat in 1996, sent in a call for reinforcements.The biggest stumbling block this movie has is just how impossibly late it is. The original film, despite it's flaws, had a lot going for it with it's white hot cast, adventurous spirit and unique story. It didn't matter that a computer running Windows 95 could somehow interface with an alien spaceship or that Vivica A. Fox and Boomer the dog avoid a trillion degree fire by hiding from it in a closet or just how impossibly racist Judd Hirsche's character was. It just felt right at the time. This movie however is just so long overdue that it's no longer the cute as a button baby that we would have embraced with open arms had it come out in 1998. Instead, it's an overweight 34 year old man with a mustard stain on his horribly faded Blues Traveler t-shirt. The overall story feels dated, juvenile and ridiculously out of place especially when compared to the films that came in it's wake over the last 20 years like Edge of Tomorrow and Battle Los Angeles which believe it or not is a better film than this. The action is confusing, the story is limp and certain characters make returns only to die or unceremoniously be written out of the story. There is an extremely interesting side plot dealing with an ground war that the aliens fought with human forces in Africa which would have made an incredible film in and of itself but that bit is forsaken in favor of more cameos and another far more convoluted story line that ends with an even more unbelievable and convoluted cliffhanger.Ultimately I can't really recommend this movie to anyone other than the biggest of big ID4 fans.

And of course the 'saviour' alienship with all its bombastic intellect and scientific pizazz comes right up face-on to be blown to smithereens without doing the obvious thing of announcing the altruistic reason for its presence  when apparently it does speak English at that too!

What was the fight between the two dudes about? It was just pointless and didn't add well to the overall scheme. I didn't feel connected with any of the characters. I felt the movie was rushing too much.

The story is pretty much the same as the first with aliens invading Earth. This movie starts off pretty strong and it is cool to see Earth integrating alien technology with their own. Unfortunately, the movie pretty much goes downhill from there. The battle sequences are all good for the most part and so is the CGI. The acting is pretty bland and bad, except for Jeff Goldblum. They brought back Brent Spiner and he was so annoying. His jokes and attempts at humor are so bad. There are also so many unnecessary characters throughout. During the main battle sequence, it kept cutting back to these kids on a bus. They were just there for comedic purposes I guess, but it wasn't funny. There is more cringe- worthy romantic dialogue, and even more stupid subplots then you can count. Then there's a reveal in the third act that comes out of nowhere and is so, so dumb.Overall, Independence Day: Resurgence is a terrible movie and not a good sequel to its memorable predecessor. This movie looks promising from the beginning but gets worse and worse as it goes. The humor is not funny and the abundance of characters take a toll on the film.Independence Day: Resurgence gets a D+.",Independence Day - Resurgence
276,pokedom,It's hard to brace for impact when there's nothing coming.,5,14 July 2016,"I read the reviews about 3 hours before going to see this movie. Some were good, some were bad. Some were ""DON'T LISTEN TO THE H8ERS!!!1!"", some were ""What a waste of time"". And when I got to the theater, I was half expecting it to be boring, bad, and lazy, but at the same time, I was half expecting great special effects, and good action. When I got out of the theater, I got mostly that.It had decent story. Not terrible, but not particularly good either. The great special effects were very gripping, and at times very realistic looking. It tied to the first movie well, and some of the jokes were very funny.However, for every good quality, there were an equal amount of bad qualities. The characters were either re-hashed from the first movie or bland, forgettable, or served no purpose. Seriously, what was the point of the Chinese pilot lady other than being a love interest for the bland best friend stereotype? None. And there was no point for the bland best friend stereotype either other than existing.At times I felt the movie was copy/pasting other movies, or at least referencing them. The ""new"" alien technology was just a glorified version of Man of Steel's alien weapon, among other moments.The movie is very forgettable. Many of the scenes were unnecessary. Some were just long. Sometimes information showed up only to be forgotten about moments later. Heck some scenes are predictable. Many times over it looked like someone we were supposed to care about was about to die, but we know as the audience they won't. Only unimportant characters die.I feel like the biggest complaint this movie receives is that it's not realistic. To that I say... this movie isn't supposed to be like our world. This movie is set in a universe where the first Independence Day happened. In our universe it didn't. Get over it.My biggest complaint is that it tries to be a Marvel Movie instead of an Independence Day sequel. You know how most Marvel Movies have a moment or seven to set up a sequel, be it at the end of Age of Ultron Thanos gets the Infinity Glove to set up Infinity War? Or how at the end of Thor The Dark World The Collector gets the Aether and sets up Guardians of the Galaxy? Yeah. They do that too. Except it doesn't even wait until after the credits to straight up confirm a sequel, it just does it right before.There's a lot to love, but an equal amount to hate. I would only recommend this to someone who liked Independence Day and wanted to see how a sequel would be like. Everyone else, just wait until it releases to see if you love it or hate it.",Independence Day - Resurgence
277,geddyneilalex28,Saw it as part of a double feature with part 1,1,23 June 2016,"Our local movie house showed both tonight. Part 1 was remastered and in 4K, it was just as awesome as I remember, and we were ready to dive right into the sequel. I was 25 in 96, and loved the first film. Part 2 is a total mess. No central theme, terrible acting, and segments that don't go together. I felt no connection to anyone, and by the ""middle"" of the film, I was rooting for the aliens. I cannot understand why they waited so long for this film and then delivered this mess. Will Smith dodged a bullet by missing this train wreck. What were they thinking? I am dumber for having seen it. Seriously, not one part of this film made any sense at all. My head hurts now. They leave it open for sequels that I hope never come to pass.

278,blazedounal,Independence Day: Resurgence (2016),4,7 August 2016,"This is one of those movies where the grown up audience knows after 5 minutes, that the target group is teenagers. I was looking very much forward to it, since I'm a fan of the original (nostalgia based). 15 minutes into the movie I just knew it was going to be bad. Made by the same director that made the movie 2012, it has the same terrible drama and completely transparent story-line. I'm not even sure if there even is a story-line to this movie. There were multiple disjointed scenes where the script writer obviously was not concerned. For example, in the opening scenes, we're told of a world at peace where there had been no wars for 20 years. A couple of scenes, we're treated to a scene where a ""warlord"" is introduced who appeared anything but peaceful. Do not waste your time. I was prepared for a mediocre film that was mildly entertaining but rather received a movie that was beyond bad.The story was beginning from Twenty years after a devastating alien invasion, the United Nations has set up the Earth Space Defense (ESD), a global defense and research program to reverse-engineer alien technology and serve as Earth's early warning system against extraterrestrial threats. The main defense force utilizes equipment salvaged from the remains of the alien forces and operates military bases built on the Moon and Rhea. The Area 51 base in Nevada has become the ESD Headquarters. ESD Director David Levinson meets with Dr. Catherine Marceaux and warlord Dikembe Umbutu, who leads him to an intact alien destroyer. Aboard the ship, they discover that the alien occupants sent a distress call to their home planet before being defeated. Furthermore, Umbutu and former U.S. President Thomas Whitmore are among those who are telepathically linked with the aliens ever since their personal encounters with them. At Area 51, Dr. Brakish Okun awakens after a twenty-year coma. On July 3, a spherical ship with technology different from the aliens' emerges from a wormhole near the ESD's Moon defense headquarters. Levinson believes that it belongs to another extraterrestrial race that might be benevolent and urges the world's Security Council not to attack, but they vote to shoot it down regardless. On July 4, pilots Jake Morrison and Charlie Miller pick up Levinson, Marceaux, Umbutu, and Levinson's accountant Floyd Rosenberg on a space tug and they head for the wreckage spaceship. They pick up the wreckage spaceship and head for area 51. An alien mother-ship 3,000 miles (4,830 km) in diameter suddenly emerges and destroys Earth's planetary defenses before approaching the planet. The mother-ship lands over the north of the Atlantic Ocean, destroying cities on the Eastern Seaboard, and begins drilling a hole through the bottom of it to harvest the heat of the core for fuel, which will destroy Earth's magnetic field in the process. The ESD learns that the aliens exist in eusociality, and that one of their colossal Queens is commanding the invasion. Levinson concludes that, if they kill the supervising Queen, her forces will cease drilling and retreat. An ESD aerial fleet, led by Captain Dylan Dubrow-Hiller, stages a counterattack on the Queen's chamber, but they are caught in a trap within the mother-ship, which wipes out nearly the entire unit. In Area 51, Dr. Brakish Okun opens the container and releases a giant white sphere of virtual intelligence which was from wreckage ship; indeed benevolent, it reveals that its mission is to evacuate survivors from other planets targeted by the aliens, whom it calls ""Harvesters"", and that it has gathered a viable resistance force against the Harvesters. In the mother-ship, Dylan, Jake, and other survivors manage to escape by hijacking enemy attack crafts and pursue the Queen's personal ship, which is heading to Area 51 with its convoy. Knowing the Queen has become aware of the sphere's presence; the ESD forces hide it in an isolation chamber and use a decoy to lure the Queen's ship to a trap filled with fusion weapons. President Whitmore volunteers to pilot the space tug on the suicide mission, leading the warship to the trap and detonates the bombs, sacrificing himself, and destroying the ship. However, the Queen survives using an energy shield on her bio-mechanical suit. Captain Dylan's arriving party to kill the Queen before she can take the sphere. With the Queen dead, the mother-ship stops drilling and retreats to space. Dr Okun reveals that the sphere has asked humanity to lead its resistance and offered them new technology in preparation for a counterattack to the Harvester's home planet.",Independence Day - Resurgence

280,SamwiseG,Such a disappointment .....,4,23 June 2016,"They trailed out many of the cast from the first movie, but without Will Smith it was always going to lack that little sparkle that the first one had. Add to that a succession of pretty much second rate actors to fill some of the gaps, and it because quite an average movie... one particularly poor performance was that of Charlotte Gainsbourg, who was very wooden and monotone and really added very little to the story-line. I really wanted to enjoy this, and had looked forward to it for some time, however the story was very un-inventive - a schoolboy could have adapted the first script into this within 24 hours. I really hope they don't subject us to a third, or if they do that its another 20 years away.",Independence Day - Resurgence
281,Bryan_Roderick,One rotten apple doesn't ruin this film.,6,29 July 2016,"Independence Day: ResurgenceNostalgia is at it again with another movie from my childhood with a prolonged sequel. This was much better than Zoolander 2 but not as good as Jurassic World. Some of the cast is a hit and others just are boring and emotionless. The premise is that the aliens are back and the writing reminds you of the dialogue in the first.Roland Emmerich is back as director and producer. There was little wrong with the direction for setting up scenes but I wish he had directed Jessie Usher more. Speaking of Jessie Usher, he plays Dyland Hiller the son of Steven Hiller played by Will Smith in the first one. He's supposed to be the Will Smith of this movie but his performance comes off as stiff, emotionless, and with the delivery of a Hayden Christensen.Liam Hemsworth plays a new character, Jake Morrison and does a better job being Will Smith than Jessie Usher. I'm not sure if it was intentional, but this was one of the few Liam performances that I enjoyed. I can't say I liked him in The Hunger Games.Rain Lao is played by the interestingly named Angelababy, but her real name is Angela Yeung. She's a model/actress/singer from Hong Kong, and a way to sell the movie even more to the next biggest box office, China. She had a minimal and boring performance. Maybe if they wrote her into more scenes her performance might have been better.William Fichtner is great in this movie, another space apocalypse movie with him in it. You might remember him from Armageddon who was the Colonel who wanted to detonate the nuke before it was ready. Another great mention was Patrick St. Esprit. He didn't do much in the film but his performance was noteworthy.Jeff Goldblum was...Jeff Goldblum. He's quirky and a classically trained actor. He fit the roll back in 96 and it works now twenty years later. My favorite performance in the film was from Miaka Monroe which you've already heard me rave about her performance in ""It Follows"" and it just goes to show that she's going to be one of Hollywood's great actresses in a couple of years. She makes me more excited to see ""I'm Not Here"" due out in 2017 with her, J.K. Simmons, and Sebastian Stan.Verdict: Best seen in theaters and with a grain of salt for nostalgia purposes.",Independence Day - Resurgence
282,temrok9,Is this a joke?,4,27 June 2016,"I read in the Trivia of IMDb that Susan Sarandon rejected the role of the president in the movie because she found the script incomprehensible. Incomprehensible is the word that best describes this film, where in a storm of clichés and pointless action every sense of storytelling is dismissed.I wonder how some critics found it entertaining, since it gets boring very soon, and I even wonder how could it be that some people in the production found it possible that it would be a profitable-not to say good-movie(of course the last chapter in the Jurassic saga was trivial, but it gained a lot of money, but the problem here is that the movie looks like a joke).On the other hand, in the second half of the movie, after giving up trying to follow the story or the movements of the cast(who is where and who goes where),I started enjoying the movie, exactly as a big joke(with laughs too), focusing on the separate scenes,almost in a dreamlike surrealistic fashion, as if something was just what it was, with no connection with the story.In other words, I was glad to watch the process. In my imagination ,it became a kind of cult show I connected with Carpenter's Dark star(in another context and scale)and with the sci-fi comics of the 50s, with touches of parody.The problem is I am not sure if these things were in the intentions of the makers.There are some signs that maybe they were:the reference to Citizen Cane and the Rosebud, the phrase with which the movie closes(straight from the end of Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars).So, I am not disappointed at all, and I am even interested in what will happen next(if there is a sequel after all).However, I do not believe many people will share my kind of enjoyment with the movie.We are not accustomed to so expensive and ambiguous jokes.",Independence Day - Resurgence

But... do not have too much hope with this film, because you will probably not enjoy the next sequences so much.

284,modernmonstersdotnet,Same Player Shoots Again,3,23 September 2016,"Hollywood must be psychic: this is the second week in a row that London gets destroyed, this time by Singapore and Dubai debris, in a thinly veiled metaphor for alien migrants. Also, Independence Day: Resurgence (henceforth Resurgence) acts as a cautionary tale about the dangers of having a woman elected President of the United States, while devaluing the office so much that any four star general can be sworn into it by happenstance. It is good that 20 years have passed since the original movie became the highest grossing blockbuster of 1996: the State of the Union has changed quite a bit in a generation, and the sequel brings those changes under a magnifying lense.In 1996, the aliens stroke the United States, perceiving the land of the free / home of the brave as the world's thinking head and powerful shoulders. If Washington fell, their victory was a sure bet. Former jet pilot POTUS led the counter-offensive of a ragtag skeleton crew and USA, therefore humankind, prevailed in spite of being unprepared and vastly overpowered technologically. So, what happens in 2016?The world stands united under a US and vaguely Chinese leadership and has established a space defense system based on alien technology (basically a very slow blue laser which takes forever to charge after it blasts). The aliens will come back sooner or later, but surely not on the very anniversary of their first strike, implicating that the American calendar rule the Universe? Well, of course they appear right on time: it goes with the territorySome kind of an eight ball appears out of a worm hole and is promptly shot over the moon. Madam POTUS, as the party girl she remains, decides to delay the examination of the crashed spacecraft until ""after the celebration"", one of her many poor decisions before she gets annihilated with her whole administration, conveniently assembled in one place. But David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum, hardly changed in 20 years) thinks differently; he join forces with a suit (Nicolas Wright, also writer of the thing and unable to provide himself with any character consistency), an old flame (Charlotte Gainsbourg, in her ill-advised big budget debut) and an African warlord (Deobia Oparei, don't ask) to examine the alien spacecraft, doubtlessly full of goodies.""What are we looking for?"" asks someone, to be answered ""I hope we'll know when we see it."" What they don't see at first is the 3000 miles long alien spaceship gamely hiding behind the moon. This time, they are prepared, see. The mother ship has an motherf***er of an EMP which crashes all satellites, an anti-gravitational pulse which sends the Burq-El-Arab on a collision course with the Tower Bridge, and lands over the Atlantic (""Which part? All of them!""), missing the White House by an inch.And so it's back full circle to the first movie but bigger, louder and, mercifully, shorter. The dynastic system being firmly established, we have President Whitmore's (Bill Pullman, shaving his beard to commit the ultimate sacrifice) daughter Patricia, herself a jet pilot with intuitive knowledge of alien fighters command system; Will Smith's son (not Will Smith's son, praise the Lord), himself a jet pilot, etc. etc. etc. Patricia's boyfriend's Jake (Liam Hemsworth) is here for the ride with sidekick What's-His-Name. Jeff's Goldblum's father shows up too, bringing the kids to what is essentially a family reunion compromised by poorly educated neighbours, aka evil alien harvesters refueling their motherfucking ship with Earth's molten motherfucking core.The script oscillates between destruction and attempts at witty banter. Very few characters die but when they do they do so nobly. The promise of yet another sequel is shamelessly made, since a new treasure trove of technology has been unlocked for humanity to ""kick some alien ass"", rejoices mad gay scientist Dr. Brakish Okun (Brent Spiner, easily the best character around), seemingly unaffected by the death of his long time partner. By contrast, the war lord has a considerable effect on the suit. Go figure.Transposing in the interstellar realm the US inability to win a war on Earth then deal with its aftermath, Resurgence's long awaited ""killer idea"" of a sequel basically boils down to reheating the first movie with some Star Wars (the Dark Star) and some Alien (the Queen and her hive) added in the mix. To say that it doesn't break any new ground would be stating the obvious. ""It's getting real real"" underlines a savvy jet pilot, when on the contrary it has never felt so unreal, devoid of any original idea, feeling, or purpose. See you, aliens.",Independence Day - Resurgence

292,Marthian80,It makes the original look like award winning material..,2,13 December 2016,"Twenty years after the previous alien invasion, the earth is once more attacked by evil aliens in big ships. Again directed by Roland Emmerich and with most of the previous cast returning (except the most charismatic character: Will Smith), will it be just as entertaining as the first one? Or perhaps it is even better now that the CGI technology has reached the level it is today? The movie opens by showing that technology on earth didn't stand still since 1996 and has fully incorporated the alien technology discovered on the previous attack. There are now military bases on the moon and it is here that we meet some of the new cast members: reckless fighter pilot Jake Morrison (Liam Hemsworth), his (annoying) friend Charlie (Travis Toth) and their boss General Jiang Lao (Chin Han). Jake and Charlie are just some twenty-something dudes talking about twenty-something stuff, but it is shown here in great detail for some reason. After that 'drama stuff' on the moon we finally get to meet that other charismatic character from the first film: Jeff Goldblum. He is still doing research and is currently researching one of the 1996 big ships that crashed in Africa. We get to meet even more characters but since this movie doesn't stop introducing new characters until halfway into the film, I am no longer keeping track.Jeff and his team of forgettable characters discovers that the ship is sending a distress signal into deep space, and on that moment a small ship appears near the moon base. The ship is apparently unarmed but the humans decide that all aliens are hostile so they blast it into tiny pieces anyway, just to be sure. Jeff is upset by this and asks his buddies(??) Jake and Charlie to pick him up and get him to the moon site were the small ship was blown to bits. While he is there looking for some ball, the real aliens arrive, and this time they have a 3000 mile wide ship. Because why the F not right? It's part two so the ship needs to be ridiculous in size.. The ship sets down on the earth, destroys half the planet (except the White House.. sigh) and starts digging a hole because it apparently runs on planet cores. So yeah, the entire plot is just that he aliens ran out of fuel. Why didn't they take Jupiter's core? Or Neptune? Why bother with earth? I am old enough to have seen the original in the cinema, and while I was never a big fan, it was a mindless fun movie. The science made no sense in the original but the charismatic characters, special effects and one liners partially made up for it. However, this film has no original one liners, no charismatic characters (apart from Goldblum) and the science is so ridiculous that it's laughable. I mean a 3000 miles wide spaceship? The dialog is cringe worthy, the new cast members could easily be replaced by cardboard and let's not start about the things that people survive in this movie, everyone is captain America here. The sense of urge is never present in the movie and I was actually rooting for the aliens, until they started doing stupid things as well..I suggest to pretend this movie didn't happen and just go watch Star Wars again or something, this thing is not worth your time.",Independence Day - Resurgence

296,deltaforce7,My Rating is -10 (minus ten),1,12 February 2017,"Don't even want to bother listing everything that is wrong with this movie -- there is not enough space for such a listing here. If this is not the bottom of the Hollywood's cinematographic idiocy, then it must be somewhere, somehow below the bottom.There is not a single redeeming quality to this flick. Never expected any, though.The worst part is probably all this rehashing of the ideas, scenes, concepts from other movies. And, yes, it was so painful to listen to all those celebratory and troops-rallying speeches. Oh, the speeches! How they love to show all this cheap ""brave"" talk!Scientifically and logically this one is simply below the lowest possible expectations. Shows that the Hollywood producers and directors seriously think that the movie-going public has mentally degraded to the level of some single-cell organisms.BTW, with all those supposed technological advances, how come that the cars, the radios, the school buses, the TVs, the houses are still all the same? How come that the humanity that was just recently brought down to the literal stone-age level and then fought a total war was able to return to a completely normal, highly developed state of existence after those mere twenty years? Everything at all appears absolutely like there was no war and no total infrastructural destruction since ever! ...Also, first, the ""alien"" weapons keep not having any effect on the aliens and then they start having the devastating effect; a guy with two panga knives is more effective than the ""alien"" weapons, when it appears convenient for the ""plot"" of this flick.Why that white sphere did not communicate its intentions earlier (before appearing as a threat and getting shot down)? Why it had to be touched first? What? It just liked to be touched or something? And if the ""good virtual aliens"" who built the white sphere are so dangerous to the ""bad aliens"", then why did they need to ""teach"" someone else how to fight the ""bad aliens"" instead of using that destructive knowledge themselves? Why couldn't they protect themselves in the first place? Sounds exactly like ""get rich fast -- ask me how. send me $20 first, though"" (like, if you know how to get rich fast, then why do you need my $20 now, instead of already becoming rich yourself?).If the entire control of the ""alien hive"" depends upon this single ""mother"" creature, then why would she want to expose herself to a significant danger? Sounds simply dumb.All the ""alien"" weapons still look like rifles and cannons. No creativity there.Why the captured ""aliens"" were kept in such great numbers? Also, why were they allowed to stay within their bio-armor suits that offered such excellent protection? Does anyone capture an enemy tank crew and then allows them to remain inside their tank?The movie is disgustingly audience-targeted at the Chinese teenagers of the lowest intellectual denomination (lots of Chinese people are way smarter than to watch this sort of trash). Many reviewers here noticed it with the same disgust.What puzzled me was that Chinese Lunar base ""commander"" who barely spoke any good English, and who so harshly reprimanded the tug pilot (played by Liam Hemsworth, if I am not mistaken) for SAVING the whole Lunar base and the expensive defense weapon! I also noticed that not a SINGLE person at the base cheered the guy who just saved everyone - there was not a flick of positive emotion. Everybody droned about their daily duties as though nothing happened. This just could not be. It could not be a human reaction to such an event. Personnel of the entire base could not be programmed or remotely controlled by that chicken-droppings ""commander""! The script writers must be pathologically emotionally shallow and depraved individuals.The CGI and the props were not all that good either. Many CGI scenes looked like takeouts from some cheesy video game. Like I noticed already, the cars were all present-day models. The weapons were quite uninventively designed. Also, why the ""alien"" weapons were so perfectly ergonomically built as to be used by humans with no difficulty or modification? The ""aliens"" in their armored suits appeared quite different from the humans. This was just dull.Really, I just can't go on talking about this absolutely shameless attempt at making a movie. Too bad about so many good actors who had to play in it. I am sure they were all completely desperate for money, so they basically prostituted their names and their reputations by ""starring"" in this garbage.I am very sorry for those people who missed the 4th of July events in order to attend the premiere of this trash of a movie. They were obviously cheated out of their money, their time, and their patriotic celebration, but there is no point to be saying ""I want my money back"". No one gives any money back for bad movies. ""Caveat Emptor""! And just quit expecting any kind of quality from this sort of Hollywood production already! There are directors who are never any good. Seriously. Stop throwing your money away to support such horrible products, folks! At best, if you really have to, watch such stuff on pay-per-view with some friends.",Independence Day - Resurgence

299,martinmcdonough,Suspending disbelief doesn't help this movie,3,2 June 2017,"Whenever a sci-fi movie about aliens coming from other planets is made, the audience is expected to suspend a certain amount of believability for storytelling sake. The film makers know this as well, but there's a finite amount of realism the audience is willing to part with in order to be entertained.The makers of this movie ask the audience to suspend too much and are unapologetic about it. First, 20 years ago a technologically superior alien race was defeated by a computer virus uploaded by a PowerBook. Okay, sure. There's always a back door / secret entrance somewhere that the heroes find and exploit. I get it. But here we are 20 years later and it doesn't appear that this technologically advanced alien race apparently has done anything to upgrade their technology. Why? Who knows. We don't speak their language so we just have to go with it.Second, President Lone Star... excuse me, President Whitmore has been haunted by flashbacks and telepathic interference for the last 20 years... but instead of trying to learn from his experiences and episodes, he's been kept medicated / isolated for most of the time?Third, there's the whole Dr. Okun getting out of bed after a 20 year coma as if he just took a 20 minute nap? And can someone explain WHY they felt the need to make him gay? Talk about pandering. It had nothing to do with the story or plot. I could go on about the whole pretty-boy / cute-girl ""the world will stop around us so we can spew ridiculously unimportant banter just so everyone can see how good looking we are"" interruptions, but most movies these days that are filled with pyro-porn and loud explosions have to break the monotony somehow.Oh yeah, the plot. There is one? Well, if you consider rehashing the ""kill the queen and the soldiers will quit"" mantra a plot, then... Also, since Randy Quaid had to die heroically in the first one, then you had to know someone was going to try it again in this one. I won't say who, but I'll only say it is tried again.There was ONE part of this movie that I though showed potential. When Jeff Goldblum's team visits the downed craft wreckage in Africa, they could have really taken that part in a creative direction. But instead, it was abandoned. Well, they were chased out. But all movies like this one eventually become a ""we're being chased"" movie, so...Finally, the ending of the movie screamed ""SEQUEL."" As for me, I screamed ""I want my money back!"" Don't waste your time with this movie. The effects were good, but special effects do not a good Saturday afternoon popcorn movie make.",Independence Day - Resurgence
300,MovieNinjaGuy,Watchable but not memorable.,5,23 June 2016,"The first Independence Day is very cheesy and simple but it works and even now can you watch it without cringing too much. Just sit back, enjoy the simple script and simple dialogue. The flow of the film still holds up quite well. The character build up, comedy and slight drama was about rightly balanced in the film too. I doubt the same can be said about its sequel 20 years from now. Although I found the film very watchable and entertaining in places, it certainly was not as cohesive as the first part. It does not feel like you are on a journey of wonder such as the first. In fact there are far too many characters in this film to be able to engage with. The whole part of random kids driving through the US and picking up Goldblum's dad from a boat that survived an insane alien space ship crash seemed strange and unnecessary. Too many he is my dad, is my daughter, is my uncle, my niece and if not related then I want a relationship with him/her situations too. The other problem is that all the characters are constantly teleporting all over the place. Goldblum is on earth, mid Africa, on the moon and Area 51 all without too much travel involved. Pullman is in Maryland, Washington DC and Area 51, again without any travel it seemed. Felt like they were all Lois Lane from Man of Steel. Wherever the action is, we will be there. The feeling of scale by showing different areas of earth (which I think they are trying to achieve) was much better handled in the first film and made sense within the story.The new president turned out to be useless and forgotten about mid way through the film. Very strange. Pullman's self sacrifice here seemed less significant than Quaid's in the first film. Very strange considering who Pullman was supposed to be.There are good bits in the film but they are marred by a lot of unnecessary stuff and probably also too much technology they now have on earth to keep track of or care about. All the stuff on the moon seems meaningless later in the film and forgettable. There are no clever ""ah that was that thing we briefly saw at the beginning of the film (which I thought was insignificant but isn't now) helping us out here"" bits which good script writers usually include in films these days. Usually these things bridge the gap between beginning and end. The whole thing seemed a bit too dumb probably. Sure ID1 was dumb but it never got this dumb I think.The alien space ship crash was great, but the scale was probably unnecessarily large. Awesome effects and parts of the 4DX theatre experience did however make it feel like you were really flying, the part along the Thames in London in 4DX was stunning. I certainly think 4DX is the future of cinema, more so than 3D. A film such as this proves at least this, if nothing else.I did like the queen alien chase for the most part and it shows that a subtle event can have far more impact than the destruction of half of earth.Would have liked to have seen more of Goldblum and less of the more insignificant characters who do nothing really to push the narrative forward. Charlotte Gainsbourg's character seemed British at the beginning and French at the end. Bizarre. Was this right? The film needed far more subtlety in many places and also more clever things rather than some random sphere thing which explains things in plain English. I doubt I will be rewatching this even 10% of the times I've seen part 1.Finally, why didn't they bring back David Arnold for the score? Part of the reason ID1 works so well is because of the simple but very memorable grand music fitting with the Independence Day title and feeling. The ID1 theme was only used at the very end for some reason. The rest of the score seemed very bland and forgettable. Nothing like the first film.If they do make another ID movie and it's not going to be better than this, it would be a real shame and probably the end of the franchise.",Independence Day - Resurgence
301,greg-e-porter,Computer graphics and failed attempts to exploit nostalgia. Please avoid Independence Day: Resurgence.,1,8 August 2016,"Independence Day: Resurgence opens to a voice over of the President's monologue from the first film. It's one thing to make a nod to a predecessor but it's quite another when a movie immediately breaks into a reference just for reference's sake.Now, the idea is that America defeated the aliens in 1996. Using the unifying threat of the aliens and the technology they left behind, the world is all futuristic. But wait! The aliens are back. Now America has to defeat them again.I'm sure you've seen movies which are bad but not fun-bad. Fun-bad movies are cheesy and, well, fun to laugh at and with. Think about Sharknado. It's a shark-filled tornado. It's absurd and fun to talk about the absurdity. One of the reasons why Independence Day: Resurgence isn't fun is that the plot has so many holes, it doesn't lend itself to any sort of conversation. The big spaceship, for example, is so big ""it has it's own gravity"" which means all ships and buildings and people all fall towards the spaceship. The buildings and things all stay up there, until it gets to LA at which point everything falls back down.Wait, what?It would've been so easy to say it was an alien gravity weapon (to explain why the effect only happens once) but noooo, they said it's so massive it has it's own gravity. It's such a simple thing. Couldn't one person just say, ""Excuse me, could we just maybe tweak this a little?"" Independence Day: Resurgence is filled to the brim with similar inconsistencies. Even Goldblum can't salvage it, and I like Goldblum.The only one interesting point of this film, is how internationally minded it is. Transformers and other computer graphic blockbusters destroyed the box offices in China. They did so well that there was a bunch of product placement for Chinese products in Transformers 4. In the case of Independence Day: Resurgence, one of the heroes is a representative from China and she speaks Chinese occasionally. Instead of Skype, to do video chatting, people use Tencent QQ (which is a Chinese chat program), and he drinks ""moon milk"" which is half covered with Chinese characters. I'm so used to being the target audience, it's a neat, new experience to not be.If you want graphics go play a video-game. If you want Independence Day, go watch the original. But, please, avoid this movie. If we all abstain maybe this train of bad- nostalgia fueled films will stop.",Independence Day - Resurgence
302,houghtonetet,For crying out loud,6,21 July 2016,"Roland Emmerich presents the sequel to his 1996 B-movie blockbuster with pretty much more of the same. By now everyone should be more or less aware of what Emmerich movies offer. Puerile dialogue, irritating characters and jaw-dropping special effects. Well there are plenty of those in this movie in which plucky and enterprising humans once again defy super-intelligent malevolent aliens bent on destroying us.For the second time, the invaders manage to make a complete cow-pat of a relatively straightforward job of rubbing-out-technologically-backward aborigines and I found myself scratching my head wondering how they made such a botch of it. At least in the first movie the mother-ship had the sense to stand off in orbit while the City Destroyers did their job pulverizing Earth in preparation for an invasion of ground forces.Not this time, oh no. The mother ship clamps itself to Earth to begin its drilling while the Harvester Queen in person zooms around Earth on a wild goose-chase being led astray by school buses and decoys a four-year-old could see through. Invasions don't get much more stupid than this.The third film will have the nonsense go Galactic after our invitation to lead the fight against the bad guys by the good guys. With Dr Okun and the Levinsons in charge the aliens don't stand a chance.On the plus side there was no Will Smith or any stupid speeches and you have to give Emmerich his due, the visuals were spectacular and worth the admission, but I probably won't bother buying the DVD.6/10.",Independence Day - Resurgence
303,fmbr-1,"Good, but not as good as the first.",7,17 October 2016,"Sequels can be tough, especially when the first film was good. This film tries hard but just can't quite equal the tone of the first.The Good: This film sets us up with a lot of the characters from the first film and advances them 20 years forward pretty well. We see many of the kids all grown up and find out what happens to most of the protagonists as well. Special effects have advanced a lot in the last 20 years and as expected, the visuals here are pretty good. This also applies to the 'new Earth' which now has a lot of advanced technology taken from the aliens back in 1996. The acting was pretty good, but this, like the last film, got some pretty good actors in the first place so it is kind of expected. Finally, the pacing is pretty decent. There are no really slow spots for people to sit there and think 'why am I bothering to watch this?'The Bad: A minor gripe is that they talk about the 'new Earth' as peaceful and unified, yet none of this is shown. People are still greedy and money absorbed (so, it isn't because there have been massive shortages of food or anything), there are still very separate countries even with the same names like China and the United States. They presumably talk more but they are separately run and the US at least still has a President and a Secretary of Defense. They also seem to have spend enormous amounts of resources on weapons. I know they are thinking that the aliens might come back but it seems a lot of spending on a what if, presumably when there was also a huge amount of rebuilding that needed to go on. But the big problem is the tone of the film. The first Independence Day struck just the right balance between seriousness and fun. This one just goes a little too far for the jokes which lets it down in the long run. Finally, they have gone with the bigger = badder formula. The ship this time is the size of the Atlantic Ocean and there are other big things as well.",Independence Day - Resurgence

305,reallaplaine,A terrible disappointment and more of a propaganda film than anything,2,3 July 2016,"At the outset I have to say that I LOVED the original Independence Day film, which is why I was looking forward to the sequel. It was a horrible disappointment. Besides the fact that they failed to do any character build-up, and they had us bouncing back and forth from four or five different scenes, the film was insulting. I lived in America for 31 years before moving to Europe. Watching this film was insulting because it propagandized the military mentality that America will save the world. It depicted only American forces fighting the aliens, on Earth, in space and on the moon. Not a single other nation was shown to have even raised a finger against an attack which was portrayed as doomsday for the world. The small snippets showing other nations, depicted them as tribal groups under tents, cowering and listening to battery operated radios as the American President declared that they would save the world and ""please pray for us"". At least in the original Independence Day film they correctly represented the war against the aliens as a global one where all nations were involved. Besides the general disappointment about the film, I walked away feeling as if I had just attended a rally in support of America's right to continue to exercise its sense of entitlement as a dominant military presence on the planet. Maybe that wasn't intended. Maybe the script didn't get a once-over by the Pentagon's PR department. But I wasn't the only one who felt that way - as if the ""global invasion"" was one-sided, and the rest of us poor schmucks had to stand by doing nothing.

Rambling, aimless scenes just kind of strung together; little to no character development; certain important characters killed off with little or no fanfare. I could go on. The worst part is it has none of the excitement or fun of the original. I found myself not caring one lick whether or not the humans survived.Making this doubly disappointing was that I got to be an extra during the filming in Albuquerque. (I actually got about a second of screen time!) and so was really ""pumped"" about it from both that and my ""behind the scenes"" experience. The ""flavor"" of what we filmed was completely absent from the final product. I'm not sure if Roland Emmerich himself is necessarily to blame.

The 3 heroes – then President (Bill Pullman), Capt. Something Hiller(Will Smith) and David (Jeff Goldblum) saved the day in 1996. We have used the alien technology and built a strong defense, ready to win again if there is an alien attack ever.And guess what – there is one. The bad aliens are back, to steal our molten core and advance their technology but also to capture something that looks like a tiny Death Star which in reality is their foe and our ally. This ball of no-traceable field of radiation is from another planet which has superior technology to beat the crap out of the aliens.We have a bunch of oldies from the first movie, notably Pullman, Goldblum, the crazy-genius doctor (Spiner) and some youngsters who have grown up like Hiller Jr. and ex-first daughter Maika Monroe and her fiancé Liam Hemsworth who save Earth yet again.Why you should watch it?The first movie was brilliant – it evoked emotions like patriotism, joy at killing the aliens, world unification and other such positive reactions. If you were a fan, then you should be excited for this one.Uhmm – Well, I can't think of anything else.I can only think of reasons as to why I was bored out of my wits and why this one will go down without making an impact. Here are some reasons:The present day is shown to be much more advanced than it is today with spaceships and satellites which can zip and zap from the moon to Earth. Kinda unrealistic, especially when the CGI wasn't even that great. I mean the CGI in 1996 was (in some case superior) comparable to what we have here and we are in 2016.I really didn't give a dime about the characters. I actually wanted to scream out and tell them to make me care for them – well I couldn't do that, could I now? So I kept shut and watched in agony, dialogue after dead dialogue. Even Bill Pullman couldn't do anything to bring back the 'Yeah, COME ON, lets kill them'. Jeff Goldblum was actually really annoying in this movie (he was my favorite in the first) – his fake fear of heights, his dumb jokes and his so called charm didn't really work, it felt very out of place. The others, especially Madam President were forgettable. Oh and Madam President was really lame, she just didn't have the same pull like Pullman🙂The story was pretty much the same but a sadder version of it – the aliens apparently are using the same technology they were using two decades ago despite having devoured many planets to advance their technology. What a loophole.It reminded me of Star Wars and the Alien series – the space fights, the Death Star resembling thing and the aliens – movies that I don't want to compare Independence Day to.The music again didn't help, it was boring and unoriginal.And there were just too many sub-plots that didn't really tie well together unlike the first one.AdviseMaybe I am just comparing it to the first one and that is my fault as a fan but this doesn't even come close to how great the first one was. My advise would be to not waste money on this one unless you have lots of it and a lot of time too. Go watch Finding Dory (I think I should have) or something else.Note: Just read this on Deadline – Independence Day is getting crushed by Finding Dory. A couple of weeks will tell whether Independence Day re-surged or doomed and sank to the Earth's molten core.Quoting from the site – Resurgence is landing below expectations with $43.4M this weekend after a $16.8M Friday. That's disastrous for a 20- year-old beloved blockbuster franchise that Fox counted as one of its summer pillars. If there's any prayer for Resurgence's domestic box office apocalypse to cease, then it lies abroad where this $165M-$200M Roland Emmerich film is expected do draw $100M-$150M this weekend.",Independence Day - Resurgence

Next to that this is a movie to build other movies upon. Where the original had it's originality this one has the potential to let it be the first move for a series of films that only stops if our imagination does.The movie on itself is one with the best animation giving a really nice sci-fi feeling to it. The acting is great but that is not a big thing in this movie. They tried to keep the feeling of the movie of 1996 for as far as possible.The aliens are made more realistic and they try to touch the possibility of taking this subject to a bigger star wars and star trek world. But the question remains if the creators are having the same idea as me. That this isn't just a movie. This is the start to make it bigger than anyone thought we could after the first one.

Unfortunately, the sequel is dull and shouldn't have been made, especially without Will Smith. There is no suspense. There is little to no character development. There's barely even a plot. Expect to see two hours of nonstop explosions and then, boom, the credits roll up.On a positive note, I appreciate that many of the same actors (and even the original director) returned to make this sequel. Also, I thought the special effects were pretty well done.Liam Hemsworth and Jessie Usher did a good job but the script is what really limited them from making memorable performances. Even Vivica Fox, Jeff Goldblum and Bill Pullman's characters were forgettable. Independence Day: Resurgence fails to deliver in terms of character development and suspense, which is why the first film is so much better overall. Even the aliens had bigger roles in the first film.If they decide to make a third film, I hope they bring back Will Smith and, of course, work on a more entertaining script with a higher level of suspense and character development so that the audience can actually care about the movie.

This sequel is even louder and dumber with barely any fun to speak of. I won't go so far as to say this is an awful movie. The special effects are good, but the overall movie, I would have to say, is pretty bad. The film feels very mechanical. I never really felt invested in the characters or the story. The sense of awe and spectacle that the first film had in the 90's just isn't present in this movie. The beginning of the original was intriguing when mankind is discovering the existence of aliens and wondering what their intentions are. That is until they start blowing sh*t up. That plot point is obviously not a part of this movie and definitely detracts from any sense of tension when the aliens show up and the CGI carnage immediately starts. Ironically, the tag line for this movie states ""We had twenty years to prepare...""

321,lorraineesimpson,Words almost fail me,1,2 July 2016,"So what can I say about this movie .. the acting is abysmal, the dialogue is dreadful and, worst of all, it's boring from beginning to end. I don't know if Will Smith was approached for this sequel but if he was no wonder he declined the invitation! He must have read the script. I cannot believe that actors of the calibre of Jeff Goldblum and Charlotte Gainsbourg could bring themselves to utter some of their lines without throwing up on the spot. The acting was universally awful but particularly the two leading men - I can't even bring myself to find out their names but I NEVER want to see either of them again. But everyone involved in this absolute stinker of a movie should hang their heads in shame. I have absolutely nothing good to say about it - it was just dire.",Independence Day - Resurgence
322,Cathex,"Brilliant, brave, original, engaging, deep, and beautiful...",1,9 January 2017,"...are all words that can never be used to describe this film.This movie lacks any of the qualities of a good film, but does contain several qualities of a bad hooker- cheap, lazy, covered in make up, desperate for money, and on the whole rather tragic.There is nothing exciting about this film. It literally repeats as much from the original film as possible, right down to actually remaking some of the exact same shots and sequences! The plot too is almost exactly the same as the first film, except there is an incredibly facile and over-used deus ex machina that swoops in and saves the day in the end.The characters are 90% cliché and the rest is just hinged on a prayer that the actor's good looks will make you like them enough to keep watching as they spout off redundant and tortured Hollywood tropes with agonising frequency.But, for me, this was not the worst part. The worst part was the utterly inappropriate injection of Hollywood's political opinions into the plot, in the following ways: 1. The president sounds suspiciously like Hillary Clinton.2. There are female characters that exist seemingly just to fill a quota of female actors as they offer absolutely nothing to the plot.3. The US army is made up of a rainbow of colours and creeds to reflect the fact that in the Utopian future (under Hillary Clinton) there is true equality! Hilariously, however, for all of its condescending politicising, it STILL somehow manages to be incredibly racist! The African allies are depicted as a kind of 'hooga-booga!' screaming primitive tribe, who despite possessing alien technology in a supposedly unified world, still carry machetes and have a sort of 'animal' understanding of the aliens.And it also makes a subtle but incredibly insulting jab at Jews too- for when the aliens are about to slaughter our imitation Hillary, she bravely declares 'there will be no peace', which is of course a reference to the rhetoric of Palestine towards Israeli settlement-building. And with that single sentence therefore strongly implies that the monstrous aliens who want to steal the earth basically equate to Israeli Jews. Which is as offensive as it is ignorant.Personally I'm very tired of Hollywood's insipid narcissism in thinking it can lecture everyone on moral absolutism because it has money. I wish Emmerich had put more effort into making a half-decent film and less effort into trying to offer the public a cheap blow-job of a movie in return for cash.It says what it thinks you want to hear, shows you what it thinks you want to see, and yet somehow this film manages to be the exact opposite of appealing.",Independence Day - Resurgence
323,lukalele,A piece of trash that cost $165 million...,1,3 July 2016,"Independence Day, which first came out 20 years ago, has a venerable position as one of film's most enjoyable 'guilty pleasure' movies. Yes, it's cheesy. Yes, it's ridiculous. But damn, it looked good and was buckets of fun back then and still is. It didn't need a sequel, but I was surprised to hear when one was in production and was mildly excited at the thought.I didn't expect much, we've moved past being wowed by fantastic CGI (indeed, people seem to appreciate much more the practical effects which are put to good use in certain films and TV shows these days), but I thought it'd be great to tune out and watch an even bigger ship and even more aliens again attempt to take out an extremely patriotic and stoic human race.By the time I left, I didn't know whether to laugh, cry, feel anger, hate, one thing I did feel was ripped off... gone is the charm and appreciable cheesiness of the first film, what we have as a replacement are characters you can't possibly like, let alone root for, inane and predictable self-sacrificial acts that fell flat and generated no emotion whatsoever, scene after scene of horrible one-liners mixed with 'it was great working with you' exchanges of dialogue from the indestructible arrogant young army types and attempts at humour in the face of millions of human deaths, by-the-book disaster film rivalries that turn into friendships which also ended up turning my stomach, boring plot lines that resurfaced again and again which slowed down the pace of the main conflict, are immediately forgettable, add nothing to the story and went nowhere, an alien race whose entire existence is based on militaristic invasion with 20 years to prepare continuously showing their glaring ineptitude at said invasion rather than having humans fight back against insurmountable odds like the first film, a cheap-looking CGI alien queen with a shield that survives a nuclear blast yet can't take a few shots from an aircraft based on the technology from her own race who'd rather chase a busload of kids than shoot down said aircraft firing at her, a coma patient who wakes up after 20 years and can immediately make jokes and walk around with no sign of muscle atrophy whatsoever, a disabled, insane war veteran who can still perfectly fly a jet based on alien technology...I could go on, needless to say if you see this, be expecting every disaster movie trope and cliché with none of the charm and likable humour of the first film, and just try and enjoy the above-average special effects. Aside from that, there's really nothing else there.",Independence Day - Resurgence
324,jonandshellie,This wasn't as bad as people would lead you to believe... (spoilers),7,1 August 2016,"First off, let me say that I am a huge fan of the original film, so I might be a tad biased here in my review, but that aside, I found 'Independence Day: Resurgance' to be an acceptable sequel and definitely not deserving of the venom that a lot of fans spat at it over the last month or so. Is it cheesy? Without a doubt, but it's no more cheesy than any other action film that's come out in the last 30 years. Were there face- palm moments? Absolutely. Like when Dr. Okun awakens from a 20 year coma and is immediately able to not only speak, but move and hop up and walk? Why did they have to go with the whole coma bit? They could have just as easily said that he spent the last 20 years in a near catatonic state in a medical care facility. It would've explained why he was lying there with his eyes open and unresponsive on ID4, but there are a lot of face-palm moments in sci-fi/action flicks. It's part of the shtick at times and is something that fans of the genre have come to expect. That being said, the film delivered on its promise, which was to show us what has happened to earth 20 years after the first attack and how we've reverse engineered and adapted the alien technology and utilized them for our own defense systems. We got to see the aliens return and mount a second attack on earth with an even bigger and stronger mother-ship known as a ""harvester"". We learned more about the alien civilization and what their true intentions for our planet were and we get to see the people of earth mount a second fight for survival with their backs against the wall. What more did you really want to see with this picture??There were some sad parts as well. I hated seeing Vivica Fox and Bill Pullman's characters die. They were such huge, and integral parts of the original film and it stinks to see them go out that way, especially Foxes death because it was so unceremonious really. It also sucks that Will Smith had to be written out of the film. I think his inclusion would've made a huge difference in audience perception of the film and I think he would've been better off in ID4-2 than 'Suicide Squad'. I was particularly saddened to see Robert Loggia knowing it was the final film appearance for this great actor. I was moved at the small interaction of Loggia's character General Grey waving at President Whitmore at the ceremony. It was a very brief yet very poignant moment. Although the acting could've been better and was a bit wooden at times (Usher's and Hemsworth's performances were particularly awful) it wasn't terrible overall. I'm not really sure what people were expecting to see when they saw this movie, but as far as I'm concerned, it delivered in bunches.",Independence Day - Resurgence
325,goldenshuttle,Nothing new..same story,5,9 July 2016,"PROS:great video, camera motion, CGI & surround sound.good future scenes. CONS:story is the same of previous movie even the scene when Alien strangles president Whitmore and use him as a speaking tool is a copy from older movie with mild difference. Do not expect to see any beautiful actress in this movie, it is another movie where Hollywood grooms ugly women and insists that they re beautiful. Even the Chinese girl(Rain Lao), if you look carefully, her face is skewed by Botox. A lot of Jew stereotypes in the movie for a moment you think it is a rabbi gathering. Aliens & Alien mother shapes are stolen from Giger great sequel (Alien1, 2, 3 & AVP). Story has silly scenes to fill time, for example top commanders (Jake & Dylan) fist fight over a silly matter, how can people so not mature save the world? Movie assumes that president of US will be president of the world, and that is a funny assumption, why not UK, France, Germany or whoever? most young actors possess low or no talent, look at Jake & Dylan, they both do not know how to act, the same for the China girl & president daughter.

I'm not saying the first Independence Day was a classic but it was still a enjoyable fun film. This is just basically a remake and a bad one at that. I wouldn't call this a spoiler but we all know will smith isn't in this train wreck. The excuse the give for his character not being there is not good, I know they had to address it but they could have done better than the lazy excuse. Thor's brother is boring and the guy who plays will smiths son is bland. There is also a annoying side character called Floyd who I can honestly say is one of the worst characters ever put into a film. The pacing of the film is very slow, also the aliens plan has now changed from the first film. The situations and how they get pass them are to easy. Do yourself a favour and avoid this, will smith knew this was going to fail and it does so bad.",Independence Day - Resurgence

The illogical story line, massive scientific defects, and other absurdities are made up in part by short high intensity action sequences, some comic relief, grand CGI, and some interesting acting choices by characters desperately trying to make this movie work. It will be fun to watch only if you check your brain at the door.The three most distressing groups of plot points for me:1) A ONE HUNDRED TRILLION TON space ship can't land on a 12 mile thick planetary crust. If the ship's gravity is large enough to pull items off the Earth's crust it would pull the Earth and moon out of orbit.2) The logic of an ""Alien Mother Being"" controlling billions of hive creatures deciding to exit her ship (with limited protection) to pick up a small ""ball of intelligence"" defies belief.3) This super massive Alien Mother Ship had fewer fighter aircraft than a separated space disk from the original movie. Also, she had about 12 soldiers on the ground to aid her when there were Tens of Thousands of soldiers on the original hive ship (from the first movie) and therefor millions on her vessel.I said my piece, so go enjoy knowing the science/logic is really bad.",Independence Day - Resurgence

330,rohonnag,Overblown and Overdone - Yet Watchable,6,24 June 2016,"This movie is going to get bad critical reviews! The previous movie which came out in 1996 wasn't well reviewed either, but it was dumb, fun and eye popping back in the day.This new sequel takes places 20 years after the original and the aliens are back! It's up to David levinson played by Jeff Goldblum and team to save the day – again.This movie majorly suffers from Transformer-itis, with a good measure of Blow up the Queen to kill all drones syndrome thrown in for good measure. So is this movie terrible and unwatchable? Not exactly, there's good and bad.Let's start with the good parts.It's great to see quite a bit of the old cast coming back. Former president President Whitmore played by Bill Pullman is back. So is previously mentioned David and his Jewish Father. New cast members included Dylan Heller who is Will smith's character's kid from the previous movie. It's good to see them all together again. The plot moves along swiftly and the movie doesn't take too much to pick up and get going. The music is fine, the action is passable and the FX is great.Also, the film makers are self aware and they know what kind of movie they are making, thats one good thing about the film. It sometimes DOESN'T fall for the cliché. But only at times! Now comes the problematic part. Since the last 20 years visual FX has gotten a LOT easier. So easy, that every director over does it these days. From the new Terminator to Star Wars to this movie, the FX seem TOO much. There is too much going on in the screen, the eye can't focus on any one cool thing. There is 100s of cool things happening on screen! This is where the direction falters. It's the film makers job to direct the eye to something meaningful, rather than have everything blowing up and thrown at your face all at once. This is Michael bay's transformers formulae and this film also suffers from it! Then comes the rather hack job of editing. The first movie was 2 and a half hours long and had great character and human moments in-between all the spectacle. This one is rushed, it feels rushed. There is NO build-up to the alien's arrival. The build-up was the BEST part of the first movie, the anticipation of seeing those shadows covering those cities. They got rid of all of that awesomeness.There is a sudden school bus full of children thrown in good measure, the whole kids plot line comes out of NO WHERE and it feels like their introductions were left on the editing floor.There is no time to think in between the action, it's all rushed and going at break neck speeds. They should have spaced out this movie by at least 15 more minutes.The plot and story is absurd but that is one thing I was expecting all along. They do try to build more mythology about the aliens and their intergalactic war. But it all seems a bit Star Wars-ish.Some actions or things that happen don't follow logical choices but that is fine, given it's a big dumb movie.I didn't hate this film, it kept me entertained, but it is far from the brilliant original film.Fans of the first part will like it, new-comers to the genre might not get it.Rating : 6/10 . See if you like Sci-Fi, but go in with low expectations and it will be fine! P.S: They left the door open for the next part and I doubt it going to be made",Independence Day - Resurgence
331,CraigsCritique,The Cinematic Definition of 'meh',5,11 July 2016,"Now I'm going to start this review off by saying I'm a massive fan of the 1996 Independence Day film, a film that although is by no means a masterpiece but is certainly a film of tremendous fun, big on spectacle & had a very enjoyable & entertaining cast of characters, so I was worried when I heard that it was finally getting a sequel after all these years & unfortunately those worries were justified upon seeing Independence Day: Resurgence.The main problem for me was a lack of personality from our leads, Liam Hemsworth, Jessie T. Usher & Maika Monroe make up the principle new leads & unfortunately they just don't pack the punch of the original casts contrasting personalities & unusual yet effective chemistry, this is further exemplified when the likes of Jeff Goldblum, Brent Spiner & Bill Pullman (yes who thought I'd be craving more Bill Pullman!) are on screen, their appearances on screen are nothing but a joy, Brent Spiner being a particular joyful surprise, although as I said it kind of makes you long for these supporting characters more than the new young leads. That's not to say every returning character is valued in the film with Vivica A. Fox and Judd Hirsch having either no screen time or wasteful screen time placed at their door, there are also superfluous characters I could have done without including characters played by Nicolas Wright, Travis Tope and an overly British scientist played by Charlotte Gainsbourg.To be fair to the film it isn't a bad film, but it also isn't a very good one either, it doesn't lessen the current cinematic landscape but equally it doesn't improve the cinematic landscape either.It's simply this, the original film offered us a cinematic experience like no other at the time of its release, truly spectacular effects & a star in Will Smith whose charisma alone could of carried the film, the problem is these days those effects are no longer as impressive with us becoming more nonchalant to citywide destruction & with less charismatic leads in the acting department the film was always going to falter in delivering the goods.There were interesting aspects to the film though including how humanity has made use of the alien technology from the first film, there was also a situation where Hemsworth & Usher are inside an alien mothership that has its own ecosystem that was great idea, although we spend little time in this environment to make it worthy.Then we have a character at the end describing a possible situation for a future film and it made me go 'that's the film I want to see' although if it's going to be made by the same makers it makes you think twice whether you'd want it.I was certainly more entertained watching this than I was watching Warcraft, but maybe that was in part thanks to nostalgia, so to sum up as I've said numerous times now it offers nothing particularly new to the sci-fi genre nor the cinema landscape generally, but is keeps things rolling along at a reasonable pace to keep you generally interested throughout even if its not going to leave a huge lasting impression upon its audience after they've left the cinema.",Independence Day - Resurgence

333,Fiurilli,The most boring movie of the year?,3,24 June 2016,"I thought 'Now You See Me 2' was the most boring movie of the year, but now that I've watched Independence Day Resurgence it is going to be hard to decide which movie can claim this title.The movie starts off with a lot of expositional dialogue that these summer blockbusters just cannot seem to avoid. After which it sets up the characters with a lot of unnecessary conflicts and love interests. By the time the aliens show up the movie had already lost my attention and what was left was just some dull CGI action scenes which were very predictable and cliché.The movie is filled to the brim with a lot of side-characters who do not contribute anything to the plot and are only there for some funny one-liners. Well funny, the only fun part in these one-liners came from the terrible delivery caused by the extremely bad acting to be blamed in part to the very bland directing. The movie just goes from scene to scene and the director never really tries to mix in a little bit of his own style to make the film stand apart from all the other blockbuster movies that came before it.A lot of these scenes themselves contain multiple moments that do not make any sense at all which even the most unattentive viewer could point out. Like how does a simple boat have instruments that can measure the depth a space ship has drilled into the earth. Or why do only the voices of the main characters come over the command center's comms system when there are a hundred other pilots in the air. There are a ton of more moments like these, but listing them all would need more words than what is allowed in a comment.In the end what is left is a movie that is very forgetful and I cannot recommend it to anyone.

340,mother_of_popcorn,No More Sequels!,2,4 July 2016,"The announcement of the release of Independence Day: Resurgence was met with a mix of joy, scepticism and depression by me. Joy because I was a huge fan of the first film Independence Day (one of the most impressive feats of CGI at the time was the scene with the White House exploding). Scepticism because (as I've mentioned time and time again), how can you match – or top – a hugely successful blockbuster? And depression because it was in time to celebrate the 20 year anniversary of the release of the first movie and this made me feel incredibly old.All of my favourites were going to be back Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman hang on a second. No Will Smith? This smells like a dud. And it was.Using fresh faces like Liam Hemsworth and Jessie T. Usher, you can see that Roland Emmerich was trying to introduce the franchise to the younger generation. Where I think he missed the mark was the fact that it brought nothing new to audiences, particularly since there have been twenty years' worth of advances in film in between. Not to say that the effects technology in this film wasn't great, because it was. The thing that may not sit well with viewers this time around is the fact that we're not as tolerant of syrupy Hollywood cornball scripts as we may once have been. Whilst this is the kind of movie that is seen as a form of escapism and recognised as completely fictional, there are certain scenarios that had my eyes rolling and I personally think I'm generally pretty tolerant of unbelievable plots!The worst part of the whole thing was the hinting at a third film in the franchise to come down the pipeline.

343,Harbinger_3781,Can only give less than a half for this... sequel.,4,31 July 2016,"Well, after 20 years... this happened.There're a lot of things that just isn't right for this movie. The CGI's decent, fine - at least for an American movie, and the main theme is still ""Americans unite the world to save the world""-- fine, it's their movie, and they can are entitled to do whatever they want to do to make money. And this movie got a lot hails to the first one but... where to even begin?I'll start with the ""politically correct"" issue here. Hollywood has this ""politically correct"" views of things, and in every movie there used to had to have at least one role for an Af-Am to ensure this ""equality"", now they added Yang to balance the scales on the Chinese part. No problem, just... sometimes it could be a detriment. Not sure what happened after Transformers 4, but that ""Mengniu Moon Milk"" close-up shot really almost gave me P.T.S.D. Seriously? Are movies nowadays all CGI and commercials now?Then goes the real problem. The first movie held many great works: The models of the alien mothership, the destroyers and attackers - they all seemed very integrated. Very... alien. Their designs were simple but they seemed very much smooth, and like a whole unit. Unlike the human planes, which the wings and engines are two different parts, the alien crafts seem to be designed as one tight unit. In the second movie the crafts looked like they were different parts and pieces being put together like a jigsaw puzzle. The designs were more sophisticated but felt less threatening. The edged and separated models... very ""earthly"". As did the attackers' weaponry; in the first movie the green cannon felt like enhanced battle rifles - short fire rate but lethal hitting anywhere, and in the sequel it became like SMGs.The shields in the first movie felt like near infinite energy and gave out that threatening green look, and it became... breakable, in the sequel? The alien plasma cannon were city-wide devastators in the first movie and when the Earthlings took hold of it it... only... smashed a tiny... hole... in the... sphere ship. What?Then there's the actors. There were significant roles for China to play in this movie, but... Yang Ying(or commonly known as AngelaBaby), really? Of all the one-and-more-than-a-half billion Chinese in and outside China, they just had to get Yang for a role... For the first time ever I can see why folks on Baidu Forum did not like her in ID2: her acting stiff, her expressions laughable, her Chinese talking chilled the hell out of me - they sounded like she was doing crappy Chinese YA movies and not this, and she's even got that pilot crushing on her? Maybe they were right - maybe she really was better off not talking at all. And the actor playing the base commander wasn't even Chinese! Where did Hollywood find those guys? British and French movies can find better-suited Chinese than Americans! So much for the claimed-to-be ""greatest country on earth""... and cannot find a native- enough Chinese. SMHAs for the others... not making a deal with Will Smith really was a mistake. Nice of Goldblum, Pullman and Spiner to reprise but... still, does not feel right without the Steven Hiller. Liam Hemsworth really just don't pack the punch Will Smith did. And I know women changes significantly over years but replacing Whitman with Monroe feels odd as well - the two brings out completely different temperaments.The movie lacked the exhilaration and excitement the first movie brought; awesome canyon dogfight sequences that made everyone held their breaths(I even had my own version of The Nighthawk March and other music added to its background and it was awesome), and it soon became a weird hybrid of Aliens and Mass Effect, with the ""hogging resources"" alien reduced to a simple ""harvest the planet core as fuel"" alien. First movie they sent a carrier to invade, second movie they sent a miner to drill hole and harvest fuel. What's next? And the story ended with earthlings ready to go to the aliens' homeworld and counter-invade? What, ""ID3: Ender's Game""?I'm not sure what happened. Movies nowadays are like a race; much like that of the armaments during the cold wars, only with CGIs and commercials and not the true contents held within like the 80s'; this movie got very little to offer. Keeping this up and it pretty much looks like Chinese YA garbage movies.",Independence Day - Resurgence
344,geisesanja,90 million dollars MORE than the first great film??,1,3 March 2021,"Good thing Will Smith backed away from this awful project. Not worth the money, the time, the effort. I tried to watch it for maybe 15 or 20 minutes, on TV and was
very relieved that I didn't waste money on a movie ticket (as I continue to kick myself for not getting to the theater for BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY) but I digress. The only thing that got me here to write this pitiful review, is that the first INDEPENDENCE DAY, just happens to be on SHOWTIME. I do however, have more than one copy of the first film, on DVD, BLU RAY, etc. Best line ever from the very much underrated actress, Margaret Colin, ""And don't touch anything!""
And I swear, the whole cast has chemistry in that one movie, should have stood alone! As they interact, cross paths, get involved, to finally put their heads together and save the world from aliens, from ""outer space"". Too bad that has to be strongly verified these days. The 1996, now classic INDEPENDENCE DAY feels like the good old days, before it was added to the long list of films that we couldn't watch for awhile, after the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks changed our lives forever.
Now in the year 2021, as we battle a world wide pandemic, all the frightening movies are suddenly coming true.
This film should never have been made. Even the unfortunate Randy Quaid, who pretty much found the final answer to save the world with the loss of his own life, suffers with staying sane these days.
To paraphrase Bill Pullman as the president, ""A lot of people died today. (In our reality, the last year.) How many didn't have to?""
A lot of money was put into this sequel. What else could it have been used for??

There are some good elements, but there are also some terrible elements.First off, script writers are making the horrible mistake today of trying to force too much cheesy humor into movies that should be serious, and it ruin it. There were way too many attempts at humor in this movie that were just out of place.Dr. Okun returning? Not so much. Didn't really need him. I liked President Whitmore but not so much the role his daughter played. She shouldn't have been a primary. Just a lot of extra people not needed. Didn't need David's dad. The whole thing between the Warlord and the guy with the glasses - again, very cheesy. I mean, when aliens attack the Earth, it's a serious and tragic deal - not something with a Disney feel.I liked the idea of a pissed off Queen returning to retaliate. The whole sphere containing weapon plans, etc. - it was eh, okay. I almost feel like it would've worked better at the ending. They can't figure out the symbol but they figure out how to beat the Queen and then the sphere comes to life at the end and requests aid for the intergalactic war.Again, parts were good. But there was way too much unnecessary humor and too much going on plot wise. If the plot were more simple and serious, with fewer actors, would've been better.",Independence Day - Resurgence

It is almost as if they had a few left over lines, jokes and scenes that didn't quite make the cut in the first to be regurgitated here. The story fumbled along the way, the dialog was dreadful, the delivery was dead flat as was the emotional ride, the whole movie felt jerky and pieced together.You get my point . .

347,sammie_sambal,As Much A Bad Sequel As It Is A Remake,3,18 July 2016,"Like Jurassic Park the first Independence day was a milestone for its time when it comes to sci-fi movies. Not for its storytelling, because as a movie it wasn't anything out of the ordinary, but because the sets and special effects were of unknown epic proportions for its time which was enough to blow most people, critics included, out of their socks. And so it did me.But over the last 20 years a lot has changed. Movies have become way bigger when it comes their budgets and pretty much any movie that needs some degree of special effects nowadays is more or less completely handled by state of the art CGI. (not that i agree) And so logically Independence Day's success has since been copied and bested dozens of times over by such films as Men in Black, Armageddon, the Matrix, District 9, Avatar and Pacific Rim, so when I heard that there was a follow up to ID in making I was both excited and worried. ""They'd better step up their game and introduce us to a whole new level of sci-fi awesomeness.""Alas, they did not, as my rating for this movie probably already gave away. And not even did they NOT manage to step it up a notch from today's standards, they managed to take it a step back from the original, which in itself wasn't even that great of a movie to begin with! The same CGI was there, but as a whole it was just cringeworthingly boring to watch. I came really close to just walking out of the cinema at a certain point. I would've done myself a favor.If you ask me, I think that Mr. Emmerich got a lucky break back in 1996, because when you look at his track record since I see a pattern, a whole string of visually stunning disasters of disaster movies. Alright, maybe not that bad, but definitely not great either. It just rolled better. =P I mean, Godzilla? 2012?? 10.000BC?! This man is clearly all bang and no substance, much like Michael Bay. I honestly think that if they'd given this project to someone more competent ID:R could have been something much more than what it is now, a repackaged remequel (remake+sequel) for the youth of today who have heard of the nineties but aren't the least bit interested in looking back that far. Too bad though these kids will not be able to experience the same impact ID had two decades ago.If you didn't get me, ask Will Smith.",Independence Day - Resurgence

350,afatedcircle,I waited 20 years for this?,2,24 June 2016,"First off let me just throw this out here, this movie is a failure. A gigantic stinking pile of failure and if I could get my $20 back for the two tickets I bought I would jump on that.So why does this movie suck? There's really too many reasons but I'll try to lay out a few for you. Yes it's major spoilers but I don't think you'll really mind once you've seen the crapfest that is this movie.Jeff Goldblum is back. Yes! I mean let's be realistic he was one of the better parts of the first movie and the chemistry between him and the other characters was pretty good. Too bad that's non-existent in this movie. You actually don't even see much of Goldblum, all things considered. When you do see him he doesn't really have any time to get you into his character again. Oh, and his wife? She's apparently nowhere to be found, never mentioned and it's joked about that he has other love interests.Vivica A. Fox- Why was she in this movie? She apparently use her stripper money to become a doctor and is killed only a few minutes after we see her.Alien Weapons- They'd be great but they seem utterly useless against the aliens themselves, well except that orb that the aliens(known as harvesters in the movie) are apparently afraid of.The orb- An alien entity that gave up it's physical form long ago to become technology based. It shows up before the harvesters and the earthlings shoot it own in one shot. Apparently the harvesters are terrified of it but it can be shot down in one shot, yet the same gun can't even pierce the harvesters shields. Speaking of which, apparently this orb's planet was destroyed by the aliens and it now has a planet of refugees and has the technology to make weapons to destroy the harvesters. Yet, it got shot down by their technology in one shot....one shot. The harvesters on the other hand destroy these weapons in a split second.We have awesome airplanes using their technology now...too bad they still get their butts kicked. Actually, it seems they get their butts kicked faster than the jets did in the first one. What exactly did the advancements in technology do for Earth again? Chinese girl, friend of the guy from Hunger Games and Will Smith's son- Yes, this is basically what you'll call them because the chemistry between these characters is so bad you don't even care to learn their names. You can't like their characters as they're just dull. In fact, the one guy whining constantly kind of made me want him to get killed when they went in the mothership. You'll like that scene maybe, I mean it's pretty much an escape out a closing door of the ship whilst being chased...where have we seen that before? Judd Hirsch- No yamaka whatsoever in this movie but apparently some higher power is protecting him as he survives a tsunami without a scratch at all.The alien queen- Probably the dumbest part of the entire movie. Survives several cold fusion bombs because of a shield on her chest but it gets taken out by the ex-president's daughter after a few shots from her airplane and then they take her out using two alien fighter jets. But she's like 100 feet tall and uses a giant gun. Seriously, who thought of that crap? These are just some of the plot holes and stupid moments of the movie. I could go on and on but that would take well over 1000 words. It's funny, the 3 people I went with were 3 of the 7 in the theater the day before opening(Thursday). The ending makes it look like there is definitely going to be a 3rd movie but if it bombs as much as I think it will there wont be, at least not for another 20 years and honestly I don't think there should be.View at your own risk, just don't say no one warned you.",Independence Day - Resurgence

Nothing holds up here, the whole movie has that 80's/90's feeling, with cheesy and corny writing, except back then the backgrounds and aliens were plastic puppets and kinda funny to re-watch.but this is such a waste of good money, the CGI are decent (thus the 2 stars instead of 1), but with that kind of budget we could have had like 2 or 3 even district 9 movie for instance instead of that preteen movie.I'm the first to love leaving my brain at the door step to enjoy movies like 2012 and such, but this is so poorly put in motion that everything (I stress the EVERY) feels wrong, not funny, not anything This is one of the most catastrophic movie I've ever seen (thus coming here to leave a review to warn people not to waste their time on this).

355,thependragonscribe,"""Resurgence"" Still Provides Enough Alien Destruction, But Still Lacks the Gravitas of the Original.",4,22 June 2016,"""Independence Day"" is 1996's prime summer blockbuster. Despite being an unoriginal piece of space invasion sci-fi, it has its fun moments like the alien destruction, quirky characters and Will Smith's star-making performance. Now, after 20 years in the waiting, the aliens ""resurge"" for one more attack in their bigger return in the lamest way possible.As a starter, after the events of the 1996 hit maker, the whole world is unified under one protection umbrella called Earth Space Defense. A weary but game Jeff Goldblum returns as himself, again, who uncovers a plan about the aliens sending a distress signal after their defeat. Goldblum tries his best but he is given the same material from the original, and he just dragged Charlotte Gainsbourg along in his chase. And once invasion is confirmed, it is up to the ragtag team of pilots, like Liam Hemsworth, Jessie Usher as Will Smith's son, and Maika Monroe as Bill Pullman's daughter, and Roland Emmerich's stock characters to stop the invading forces.For the audience, try doing an endurance test (in the first 10 minutes) because you will likely have a hard time getting invested on anything. Blame it on the fast but uneven pacing that questions the editing, introduces new characters inserted to no effect (What are Hemsworth and Usher fighting about again?), inserts pointless characters (case in point, Judd Hirsch's unpleasant return) and kills off old characters to no payoff. Not helping is the jarring script (penned by five writers, including Emmerich, partner Dean Devlin and James Vanderbilt of The Amazing Spider-Man) that rehashes the pattern of the original. Wait what?The only saving grace is the alien destruction that made the original kind of remarkable. But even that, it basically lasts only for a while and the climax copies Ivan Reitman's ""Evolution"". Lame. Yet at least you will tolerate returnees being present for nostalgia factor (from Bill Pullman's awesome president in old man's beard and Brent Spiner's wacky scientist) and Maika Monroe's phoned-in yet bearable performance. But even they cannot save ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" for being a total trainwreck of a sequel that failed to capture the fun, the charm, the flair, the bombast, the scale and the awesomeness of the original. 2016 sequel-itis hit once again, and ""Resurgence"" is not immune.It is just a summer popcorn lackluster.",Independence Day - Resurgence
356,MikeM1984,Independence Day Divergent,3,6 September 2020,"Just a heads up, I've never watched Divergent, so don't take this as a crapping on Divergent. Based on what I've seen from trailers though this has a similar bland futuristic aesthetic and is similarly a YA (young adult) Sci-Fi.Anthony Mackie lamented at a press briefing that we now make movies for ""16 year olds and China"". Exhibit A for the Court: Independence Day: Resurgence.Independence Day (1996) is by no means a smart film. In fact it's very dumb. As dumb as it's sequel is, it's honestly not much dumber, maybe even a bit smarter in parts, but it has something this lacks: adults. The actors, to be clear are adults. I'm sure Liam Hemsworth and Jessie Usher are not much younger than Will Smith in 1996, but there are many key differences. Will Smith's character has a partner and children. He has a home, and he's worried about his image in the community. Jeff Goldblum has already divorced, and taken a middle class job. Bill Pullman's President was one of the main characters.In this? It follows mainly children. We have a President is Sela Ward, but instead of her rallying the troops it's the baby faced Jessie Usher. This has become a sad trend in movies as of late. There are no more adults to ground things. The relationships, like the one between Hemsworth and Maika Monroe feels more comfortable in an episode of Saved By the Bell than something serious adults would engage in.The script is omniscient. In the first film the aliens' objective is a mystery, and here, everyone knows everything. The Aliens are OP, but the stakes feel lower. The simplicity of the dialogue to make it easy to translate and export is excruciating. While the original is dumb, the confusion we share with the film's protagonists of the what's, how's and why's, make it seem like Shakespearean brilliance compared to this boring mess.True, this film introduces many interesting concepts such as a ship so large it has its own gravitational pull, the fact that a alien invasion actually resulted in a pan-global utopia, and hints that they have been doing this to other planets, but none of this is explored and thrust aside for the second act remake of the first.The destruction in this is very intriguing however it's far to brief. The original took its time and dwelled on it, even showing them moving on to other cities. It showed the diaspora on refugees fleeing the wreckage of our major cities. In this you feel nothing. It happens - Washington gets destroyed AGAIN - except the White House this time - but it's over in a flash.The film is a textbook example of how bad cinema is now. The adults in this film are all callback characters. The grandpas of the adult. The young actors all play arrested development kids.

Thank you Judd Hirsch for raising the only smile for a 3 second period in a 2 hour movie.Emmerich gave rise to the disaster movie genre and now he's taking it to its inevitable demise. It's nice to see all these characters again, even if they do only each get 2 scenes and 3 lines of dialogue. Somehow they made that work in the original, but not at all in this one.There's a bit near the end where they're trying to take down a ship, and in one shot you see a missile head towards it, in the next shot Jeff Goldblum says nothing and in the shot after that it's crashed on the ground and people are celebrating... it's as if every shot was supposed to be 3 times longer or that all the connecting shots got cut in favour of...well, I don't know, in favour of making it a godawful movie.To sum up. Everything you loved about the first ID4 movie -- is nowhere to be seen in this one. Any potential it could have had is lost in a bad script, rubbish characterization, lack of locations... Who cares if aliens are back doing boring alien crap again? The characters in the movie sure don't seem to.Give it a miss, maybe watch it on TV -- but be warned even streaming it illegally will leave you wondering why you bothered.

If I could go back in time, I'd tell myself to see it but only after it came out on RedBox or Netflix. It had a good story that in the hands of another writer might have been quite excellent. But there were too many cooks in the kitchen who spoiled the broth.Grade: C 7.2 out of 10 3 out of 5Plot: 7/10 The overall plot of the movie was okay. If they had given the script to another, more competent writer, it might have been great. As it was, it was only good. Character Development: 6/10 I'm just going to say it. I'm sick and tired of seeing characters made gay just because it's ""politically correct."" I don't have a problem with people being gay, but I personally am starting to get turned off by the amount I'm seeing it in movies and television programs that should have absolutely nothing to do with personal relations. This is a sci-fi movie. I want to see aliens come down, blow stuff up, and us kick their asses in return. I don't want to know that this certain character has feelings for another certain character--especially if it's two men. I'm sorry I feel this way, but I do. If you want to put a gay character in a movie, put him in a gay romance with another man that I don't have to see. I don't even want to see two women in love in a science fiction movie. I don't need to see any kind of romance in a science fiction movie because it takes away time from the actual science fiction story.Rant over.Directing: 5/10 Roland Emmerich really needs to not be given any more movies. He did great in the 90s but his time has passed. Move on unless you're going to actually make a good movie--which I don't think he's made since the original Independence Day. Casting: 6/10 Seeing the original cast again was good. Seeing the new actors was horrible--except for William Fichtner, who is pretty much just cool in everything he does.Acting: 6/10 Again, acting by original cast was great. Acting by new cast was pitiful.Cinematography: 9/10 The overall look of the movie was good, but they did rely entirely too much on CGI. The aliens were done well, as were their ships.Music: 9/10 Pretty much the same music from the first movie, so I can't complain.Pacing: 10/10 The movie did not drag, which was good. Sets and Costumes: 9/10 Can't really complain about the standard military uniforms everyone wore. Re-watchability: 5/10 I saw the movie just to see it. I'm glad I did because now I can decide if I want to buy it on digital or not. I might not because of the whole icky gay thing (and again, I don't have a problem with it, I just don't want to see it because it's not my thing). I probably won't buy it, but I will be interested in seeing the third movie that they set up but that will probably never come out.Overall, good idea for a movie but too many issues dragged it down for me and made it almost not worth seeing.",Independence Day - Resurgence

I've watched it every single year since then between July 2-4. As a grown up I knew when they announced the sequel that (especially with this writing/directing team) it was never going to live up to the 1st one, how could it? I didn't care, it was still one of my most anticipated movies of 2016. I just hoped that it wouldn't end up being one of the worst sequels EVER. But it is, it really is.The movie ""breaks"" virtually every sequel ""rule"" you can imagine. Aspects of the original have been rewritten... apparently when Will and Jeff were in space in original the aliens were trying to drill plasma holes to the earth core in Africa, The clearly dead Dr. Okum didn't really die, he's just comatose until comic relief is needed. Giants leaps in suspension of disbelief (I know it's an alien movie and all but come on), seriously we went from normal society to Star Trek in 20 years? A fully functional moon base and whole new technological society based off alien technology even though we can't duplicate their power or reverse engineer their tech, plus half the population died in attack, but apparently not the scientists or doctors. Made worse with the inclusion of an entire alien ship has been off limits to the world and guarded by a warlord in Africa. Or the warlord's son who apparently has fought and killed aliens in hand to hand combat. How about the fact that the Aliens have no vocal chords but can hoot and holler and celebrate loudly?Then we have the BLATANT movie rip offs, Transformers, Aliens, X-Files, Godzilla, amongst many many more. And I don't mean ""they're all alien movies"" I mean STRAIGHT UP STOLE IDEAS THEY HAD SEEN BECAUSE THEY WERE ALIEN MOVIES.The stupidity if the plot is amazing, yes it's really that over the top terrible. Just utter nonsense. Intergalactic resistance, cosmic ball of knowledge, and an alien hive society complete with (multiple) 300 foot alien queen with shield vest (yes all of that is written correctly). Can I just say that when a sentient talking ball tells you to destroy him because he contains the secrets to the universe and if Aliens get him the galaxy is doomed forever, do it, don't hide him in a storage container and hope the Aliens don't find him. The inclusion of a female president due to Clinton was so "" on the nose"" it was laughable.In closing, I will continue to watch ID4 every 4th of July, but I will never again watch this festering disaster or part 3, and yes the movie flat out says there will be a part 3. Will Smith is a genius for being so greedy he wouldn't do these movies.",Independence Day - Resurgence
366,prth_gswm,Not good as the original but still a visual treat....,10,25 June 2016,I have been a huge fan of Roland Emmerich. I grew up watching his movies. I have waited ages for this Independence Day: Resurgence as i have liked the original a lot and I am so happy to see it finally coming out so does it lived to my expectations? Let's see. First of all I have enjoyed this movie and i don't care what others have to say. May be it is not as good as the original but there is something in this movie which is more sinister than the original.I thought alien queen is the best thing about this movie.She is something which we have not witnessed in the original.The plot do have loopholes and low in destruction compared to Emmerich's previous movies but it is not boring at all. The movie will keep you engaged till the very end.All the actors have done justice to their given roles.Overall if you have liked the original then you won't be disappointed watching this flick. But do watch it in the theater. A visual treat.,Independence Day - Resurgence
367,bayareamike,Complete garbage...........,1,30 July 2016,"I got stuck watching this & because of the kids had to sit through it. This is the most horrible film I have seen in recent memory. Absolutely ridiculous story line, terrible acting & absurd 'special' effects. The movie seems to be written for a audience of 4 year old kids. I won't even go into the substance of the film because there is none. As I sit here & finish watching this, I can't believe people in a movie studio somewhere said to themselves ""hey everyone, this looks like a great movie project"", and actually could look themselves in the face after the meeting finished.A complete embarrassment for anyone involved in the project. If you're out of the target demo of a small child, chances are you'll also come to the same conclusion. Maybe you'll cherry-coat it with a rating of 3 or 4 to be nice but you know what I mean.",Independence Day - Resurgence

I rented because of all the bad reviews for those who saw it in the theatre (thanks for the warning!) Some of the worst writing and maybe the worst acting I have ever seen. How does Vivia Fox's character go from being a stripper to a medical doctor? When Judd Hersh's character is close to being killed off, his acting was atrocious, it was laughable. This movie is just a re-hash of the original movie (which was a great, fun popcorn movie.) This movie is just flat out Hollywood garbage. In the past 5-7 years Hollywood has really tanked. Dean Devlin and Roland Emmrich should be ashamed of themselves for producing such a terrible movie!",Independence Day - Resurgence

This movie was rushed badly, with almost no time to enjoy a scene before the next one comes up. This seems to be one of the subtler reasons why so many critics here don't like it much.I found the idea that Will Smith could possibly be missed very strange when his picture is in nearly every other scene.This movie also suffers from sequelitis. Slipshod efforts in so many scenes. This movie could not stand up on its own which is the sterling standard for sequels. If anyone out there cant figure out there is a possible third movie, they need to re read their ""movie class 101"".I tend toward forgiveness for much of this movies misses.

Love all the actors who participated but the film left me underwhelmed. Expected some great acting moments after 20 years, but it did not happen. Liam Hemsworth was a nice addition as was Will Smith's son, Jaden. But to have Vivica Fox reduced to such a small role was unforgivable. The storyline also seemed like it was not thought out well and didn't have anywhere to go. The producers tried to introduce a lead in to part 3 which may actually be interesting if they put some time into a great screenplay. I was simply left needing something better.",Independence Day - Resurgence

The return of the original cast members was completely wasted, and the new characters have no emotional depth. The plot jerks around from location to location and character to character with no cohesiveness. Will Smith could not have saved this movie. Also, blatantly manufactured to do well in China. Features a well known Chinese actor, has people speaking in Mandarin, I guess? (Since Chinese isn't a language)... and lots of explosions with poor dialogue intended to be one-liners... which sadly fell flat.Don't waste your money. It'll probably do well overseas on the CGI and explosions alone, so maybe they'll beat the dead horse again and squeak out the third they planned to make.Movie feels more like a Saturday morning cartoon from the 80s than a thrilling sci-fi movie. I never felt any sense of empathy for the characters or any real sense of danger from the destruction.

375,michaeldavies335,What Happened?,4,8 July 2016,"To begin with I must stress how much of a fan of the original 1996 Independence Day movie I am. For me, its my all time favourite film. Like most movie lovers there are certain films that you go back to now and again, purposely leaving 6 months or more until the next viewing just to make sure that you forget a scene here and there.I've searched for years about the possibility of a sequel for Independence Day and when it was announced that there would be one, even so far as to have 2 sequels, I was very excited.I went to view it last night trying to ignore the 5.6 IMDb rating, not reading reviews in case of any spoilers that were left in there and basically approaching it knowing it wasn't going to be a story driven movie like Shawshank or The Godfather. Unfortunately I left feeling very disappointed. I've given it 4/10 only because of the graphics which I thought were very impressive albeit relied upon too much, and the other reason was seeing the characters from the first movie.My latter reason - the characters - brings me to my first point. Whilst as mentioned it was great to see them on the big screen again and involved in a new story I left feeling as if there had been no character development or at least no explanation as to how they got to where they were.Take Jeff Goldblum's character David. One of his driving forces to get to the White House in the first movie was not only to inform the Presidency that the clock was ticking, but also to save his estranged wife - Constance (Margaret Colin). She was a massive subplot character yet she was no where to be seen nor was any explanation for her lack of appearance given. It took a quick search when I got home to find out like others have tried to, that she died in a car accident in the official prequel novel to this movie - Independence Day: Crucible. I didn't even know this existed, apparently it was released a month before Resurgence came out. I'm hoping that this will explain in more detail what happened. The character of David seems unaffected by her loss and the story hints at some romance between him and some English women that ""he met at a conference"".Moving on to the next character - and in my opinion the most important one - President Whitmore. His leadership and amazing speeches gave humans hope and determination to fight back when the time came. In this movie he's just a bumbling old crazy man, all it would of taken was a quick 2 minute scene where they explain that after the original movie, Bill Pullman's character suffered from a PTSD due to the attack or that he worried so much about another attack that he lost his mind. Instead it came down to the telepathic connection he had from the original movie that made him into this weak character. Which brings me to his demise. I couldn't believe how poor his death scene was, and to be perfectly honest with you, it was all for nothing. Yeah he destroyed the Queen's (more about her later) mini ship, but she survived the explosion due to her having a personal shield, so it was all in vain...and as for his ""Happy 4th July"" line before pressing the button to set off the bomb, there was no build up whatsoever, as soon as it happened I had to double take and thought to myself - ""is that it?"". Just remember back when Randy Quaid's character gave his final line ""Hello boyyyys, I'mmmm backkkkkk!"" after taking the jet into a vertical flight and then boom, huge explosion, the destroyer is defeated and lots of ""USA! USA!"". Although cheesy, it gives me goosebumps every time.My last point on original characters and this will be quick is of Jasmine - Will Smith's wife to be. Again like Contance for David Levinstein - Jasmine was a driving force for Captain Steven Hiller. In this movie she's now moved on from being a stripper to apparently being pretty high up in a Hospital. Again, zero explanation, another chance to have a quick 2 minute scene perhaps with her son Dilan. This would of been perfect timing to discuss Will Smith's character - Cpt Steven Hiller - having died. Her death was also very weak, her character was wasted and never mentioned again.Now moving on to the new characters - this is going to be very brief. Poor acting, unlikable and it felt more like Hunger Games: In Space. This of course helped with the inclusion of Liam Hemsworth - the cheaper brother. Not at all interesting and forgettable.All in all it was a very bad film, I feel I could write all day about what I thought went wrong with this movie but if you've gotten this far down my babbling then I thank you and will save you from the rest. I just sit here shaking my head at a missed opportunity.To finalise, in my mind, this movie for me will not be connected to the original Independence Day. I'll still watch the 1996 movie as if the final scene was the end of the story to be told.I just wish to say this to Roland Emmerich for producing this poor sequel to a cinematic classic: ""In the words of my generation...Up Yours!""",Independence Day - Resurgence
376,jamisonjohn,Not a bad movie.,8,29 June 2016,"Let's start with the bad. Firstly, this movie only has a bad rating because people in the 20's who have never seen this movie expected a Michael Bay type, blow em' up action film, that was a piece of crap. A lot of hard work was put into the movie and it shows. However, I did not enjoy the first hour or so. The script was dry and made little sense, AND was a little rushed. Secondly, Captain Hillard's son was a JERK!! For no reason, I might add. Now the good. The special effects were amazing, the acting from the veterans was amazing, and for the most part, the script was very enjoyable. I really enjoyed the conclusion. Sorry little kids, but you did not get a Michael Bay movie. Go watch Transformers and do not forget the Vaseline. This is a movie made like old style American movies. Fun for the whole family, and I highly recommend it.",Independence Day - Resurgence
377,storm_mica,"needs more action, less drama",5,27 June 2016,"I didn't really like the first one, but when my other half suggested we take in the second one (in 3D) on a cold winter afternoon I went in with an open mind. Firstly, the 3D is terrific and if you are going to see the film at the cinema, definitely ""worth it"". Where this film could have worked better is less drama and boring back stories and more action. Their target audience wants to see the action, things blowing up, exciting chases through the sky / space etc etc; not an episode of ""Neighbours""!!That aside, the Aliens weren't quite as scary as they should have been and humans were just plain stupid. As for the rival alien in the sphere... What the? The acting performances were uniformly cardboard, almost like the actors were reading the lines off an autocue, but you almost expect that from this kind of thing.It could have been so much better but at the end of it all it was still a pretty spectacular movie, in an overkilled way; but isn't that what we're paying for?",Independence Day - Resurgence
378,Info-241-562323,Oh Please - Why Bother??,2,1 August 2016,"I think the real reason Will Smith decided not to appear in this 'remake'/sequel was probably down to him reading the script; seeing some screen shots, and thinking WTF?Why oh why do they bother doing a follow-up of what was a perfectly good film, and completely destroying just about every part of it? The script is woeful (ridiculous one-liners which are totally out of context - think of Starship Troopers with a script written by a 9-year-old and you'll get the idea).Obviously the majority of the budget was spent on CGI - and even that wasn't great in parts. I felt some parts had a very synthetic feel with poor layering making it look... well like poor CGI. I can only suggest that the designers/programmers had also seen the script and cast and thought it was all a bit of a joke anyway - they wouldn't have been far wrong.Trying to re-create the classic 'punch' scene from the original movie was completely wasted, and should have been the first (of many) scenes to hit the cutting room floor.The one thing this film will make you appreciate, is the value Will Smith brings to a movie. I'm seriously delighted he couldn't find the time (apparently) to have anything to do with this farce.For anyone who actually enjoyed this movie - may I suggest (if you're unfamiliar with the first 'original' instalment) that you watch the 1996 release and see for yourself the complete mess and waste of time they spent on this effort.All-in-all summary: Acting 3/10. Script: 2/10 Actors' On-screen chemistry - non-existent. Special FX 3.5/10 Rating 1.5/10.Verdict: Waste of time in making something which had already stood the test of time for the past 20 years.

If you have a sense of humor and you're willing to watch this not fully immersed in it but still enjoying it for entertainment purposes, it's a great movie. If you're thinking you want to see a movie that is serious like the original Alien movie, no, this is nothing like that.Think of this as simply the first independence day movie redone but with the volume turned up to 11. The basic premise is basically, lets take what we did the first time around, and do it bigger, crazier, and even more cornball than the first. Lets trot out every movie trope known to mankind in a single film. Yes every single one of them is in this movie. It is in fact a long sequence of overused cliche's, and yes I believe the filmmakers knew that, and yes I believe it was intentional.This is like a dead pan version of tropic thunder. This was like actually fun to watch just to see the various cliche's employed.I could be wrong but I think EVERY SINGLE SCENE IS A TIRED Cliché.And that was actually interesting. People are saying it's not original but I have never seen an alien as tall as a skyscraper chase around a school bus. (Awesome scene) This is where Hollywood needs to go more often. This is both a salute and a slap in the face to its predecessors. The first movie was still taking itself seriously and a little cornball but this one frequently deadpans 'yes this is a joke' without flinching. At one point I asked myself ""Why does the Alien hate the school bus so much??"" Answer: BECAUSE IT CAN.This is entertainment at a higher level than I'm used to. What else is there to do?In an industry that can't stop copying itself and can't seem to do 'serious' without being trite, just embrace their general failure and roll with them in this new self-aware comedy dressed up as a sci-fi action movie called ""Independence Day"".",Independence Day - Resurgence

393,abhinav-prkash,A Treat for original ID lovers,8,6 July 2016,"After seeing original Independence Day, I remember telling myself that this changes everything now. Movies won't be same ever again. The original ID was a ground- breaking, era-defining work that had probably induced largest collective jaw-dropping phenomena in world.So my expectations for this movie were pretty modest. All I was looking for was 2 hours of intense action, explosions, and mega battle scenes, with a bit of drama and comedy here and there. And I was not disappointed one bit. The sequel is one linear plot of action on a scale from crazy to insane that kept me glued on seat. The story is actually credible and it directly builds on the material from the original. Although execution could had been better, but its pretty spot on for its genre and franchise. Acting, well frankly, I didn't go to see Oscar winning performances here, which incidentally I couldn't even see in Revenant. The most charming part was indeed reprisal of so many characters from the original movie. Seeing Jeff and Bill Pullman back on screen after eons was like a personal accomplishment. Judd Hirsch, who plays Jeff's father, doesn't look a day older and finally after 20 years we see Brent Spiner still alive and kicking, and great that directors really expanded his role this time. The movie certainly has plenty of weak points. Sela Ward plays one of the most dumbest and forgetful Presidential character in memory; may be directors just put her there to show what to expect when Hillary Clinton takes over USA. The CGI, instead of being ground-breaking, just follows suit, and the logical inconsistencies and loop holes of movies are in in my opinion now trade-mark of all Roland Emmerich's movies. But I feel a rating of 5.6 is not justice for this excellent piece of action and Adrenalin. Just for bringing back Goldblum on screen it deserves two additional points !",Independence Day - Resurgence

Scenes are just thrown at the camera with people yelling through an absolute onslaught of computer graphics with little to no coherence, stakes or anything remotely resembling entertainment. Actors from the first movie return and even most of these stink the place out, even the likes of Jeff goldblum and Brent spiner - and it hurts to write that.The only passable scene in this 165 million dollar turd is where the main alien ship lands on earth and destroys half the Eastern seaboard but even this was laughably dumb and largely ripped off one Emmerich's earlier films, 2012.This film makes even the worst transformers films look good it really is THAT bad.

395,darrenmurray84,It is like the poor man's Battleship.,4,24 June 2016,"It has taken Roland Emmerich 20 years to get a sequel to Independence Day made. In this time he has had some flops and some big hits. I think he may have made this, definitely his poorest offering yet, so that no matter what he makes next will be classed as brilliant in comparison.The film is a comic book of a film, and in my summary I said that it is like a poor man's version of Battleship. I am not saying that Battleship is good, but its at least enjoyable, something which independence day 2 never reaches.In the original movie, which was made with a much smaller budget than this overblown mess, the effects seemed spectacular. This was down to the fact that at the time, there was still a large use of practical effects. Unfortunately this time round, there is an overuse of CGI. Some of it is admittedly excellent, but it is so lifeless, it just drains the film of any feeling.Also the film was set in a real world environment, which was unprepared for an alien invasion. When it happened the characters had to fight them with real world weapons like fighter jets. In the sequel we have space ships with warp drives and laser guns, with space stations on the moon another unlikely addition. There is absolutely nothing in the film that you can relate to.It is good to see Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman and Judd Hirsch back from the original, but other than Goldblum, they are pretty much wasted. Luckily the actors are good to overcome their underwritten parts and Hirsch injects the film with some humour. When Judd Hirsch is one of the best things in action movie, you have to ask yourself whats going on? The new leads are unfortunately pretty poor. Its not really the actors fault, as they cant really do much with what they are given. The supporting cast are also wasted, with William Fichtner being totally underused.On the directing side, Emmerich just overloads the screen with a ton of effects and hopes it covers up for the total lack of imagination which he showed in the original. I have read that he is looking to make a sequel to Stargate next. I hope that the failure of this movie stops that from happening, as I actually think that is his best film.",Independence Day - Resurgence
396,barosanescu,We waited 20 years for this?,2,29 June 2016,"I have to stop going to the movies and wait for these abominable Hollywood productions until they get on Netflix. With the price of movie tickets nowadays (not to mention $5 drinks and $10 popcorn), and folks, please save your money. The script is beyond dumb, the acting is horrible, CGI's are ... CGI's. I don't think the movie was ever edited, the only thing they had in mind was cash, cash, cash. Put it out as fast as we can and maybe they will not notice how stupid, boring and senseless the whole story is.1. To the Hollywood dumb asses: the first thing we'd steal from aliens would be SHIELDS and put them around our asses. You forgot that one. 2. Sure, we have a woman running for president, but you had to put one in the movie. Hint to what Hollywood hopes to install in our brain? 3. Billions people die but we have time for bad jokes. Do we need comic relief in all the apocalyptic movies? Dumbest lines I've ever head: Data joke (who doesn't remember Data from STNG?): ""Let me take you to the sickbay"". Really? The joke with the mosquito that flew outta cow's ass is funnier. Bushman to paper pushing pansy: ""You have the heart of a warrior"". Spank me sideways and send me to bed! Horrible! ""You are a primitive species"". Well, not all of us, just the ones that put out crap movies like this and the actors that get paid for this crap.And for the ones that claim that ""this flick was not so bad"", a few words: go read an f-ing book instead of writing good reviews for bad movies.

397,hegedus_dani02,"Entertaining, but slightly average",6,5 July 2016,"Roland Emmerich's Independence Day: Resurgence is a typical 2010s Hollywood sci-fi sequel. The action scenes are more stunning, the explosions are bigger, the plot is similar to the first movie with just a couple differences. So I sit down without any expectations, and I got what I expected and even a little more. The visual effects and the sound mixing are amazing. Emmerich's crew really did a great job. The action scenes are well-made with huge explosions, but not always entertaining due to the awful script. The actors brings the minimum for a summer blockbuster sci-fi, except Jeff Goldblum and Judd Hirsch who 'stole the show'. I personally liked William Fichtner, because I think the USA president's role as much matched to him as his short cameo in Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight. The direction is average, but I still believe that Roland Emmerich is a good director, though he made some pretty bad movies such as 2012 and Godzilla. The biggest mistake of this film is it's script. The characters are badly written and under developed. Liam Hemsworth's, Usher's and Maika Monroe's character could easily get 10-10 minutes for character- developing. The huge twist was also needless and unentertaining. If they want to make Independece Day 3, they should have at least give it an acceptable reason in the plot. If you want the see a visually stunning summer blockbuster with huge explosions, some jokes, an American ending, and without a mind-blowing theory or plot twist than you can give it a try. 6/10",Independence Day - Resurgence

399,sanwit,The original was way better,4,24 June 2016,"'Idiotic' is the first thing that comes to my mind when talking about this movie.Only 1 ship had landed 20 years back,but it only gets investigated 20 years later when the lights come back on. Liam Helmsworth almost crashes an ultra-expensive weapon, then saves it, but nobody bats an eyelid. He asks everyone to exit the hangar, and everyone just...does. He steals a craft, comes to Earth, goes back to the moon, and then back to Earth, but nobody arrests him. An array of alien-tech weapons surrounding the Earth is remembered at the last possible moment. Last time, they needed lots of modifications to be able to pilot the alien crafts, but this time around, they seem to be tailor-made for humans. The alien mega-ship lands on water and starts to drill in the middle of the ocean, when it could easily have landed over land(It would have killed a lot more of us, and that is what they want, right?). Heroic fight sequences ensue, where not one of the central characters can be hit by the aliens(It does, however, prove that the aliens did not produce this!). The current POTUS addresses the ex-POTUS as President. The Queen can activate huge ships from light-years away. She can control small alien crafts but decides to get hit a few times first. Liam Helmsworth loves the 2 words 'fusion drive' very much and thinks they are the solution to everything. Small alien crafts can supposedly escape the Queen's control if they fly too high, and keep escaping even when they are close again!!! A lot of the scenes are there which are almost the same as the original movie(with better VFX). After making sure they have set up one(or more) sequels, the movie finally ends.....don't complain if you have a headache. It's NORMAL!",Independence Day - Resurgence
400,kokorikos,i want to be fair..not bad at all..but...,7,25 June 2016,"i don't know how to start...the movie has its good moments and bad moments...in general its fun and impressive..the cgi is superb...it lacks in character depth and scenario...the advantage of the movie is without doubt, Jeff Goldbloom..and he covers a big part in the movie fortunately...some characters seem to have a connection with each other..some others, don't...for example, i think none of us cared about the sacrifice of ex president Whitmore...some other parts of the film looked kinda extreme..for example , the walk in the desert of the giant queen, is a little ridiculous, i mean no creature of a so high intelligence decides to attack against half the army of USA , alone and defenceless running like a mad bull in the desert(knowing that its death, means the failure of the mission) chasing a ..bus full of children..i mean its hilarious..but it contributes of course to the agony of the viewer..will the children be saved or not? another thing that has some value to notice, is the mysterious alien sphere ..it didn't convince me that the bad aliens were afraid of it...in fact, this sphere looked to me like the little funny robot in star wars..without a doubt this was an idea of the writers to continue a third part of the movie...finally ...the movie deserves to watch it..u can easily forget the silly scenes and focus to entertainment..after all is fictional...who will put the blame to the director for some little errors? PS..i give an extra credit to the crazy doctor and thank God, earth was saved once again, some seconds before the end ...well, we love Hollywood anyway! i put a seven, because good efforts have to be rewarded.",Independence Day - Resurgence

403,Faizel-R,Mediocre sequel to a popular hit,5,1 November 2016,"Sequels are rarely better than their predecessors. Independence Day:Resurgence is a mediocre attempt to carry on the story from where Independence Day left off. I have watched many of Roland Emmerich's previous ""Sci-fi"" offerings, the likes of Stargate, 10000 BC, 2012. The movies are entertaining and not to be taken seriously.The story telling is very weak in this installment and assumes that the viewer has watched the predecessor some 20 years ago. Also the plausibility with the respect to the setting in context of what has transpired before in 20 years would technology have advanced so much given that in the first movie with 45 years since Roswell they could'nt figure out how the alien tech worked in the absence of the Mothership. That would be taking the movie too seriously.All in all this is not a total failure, it has some good fun moments.",Independence Day - Resurgence

And this sphere comes from what seems to be a worm hole... (this is important! this means she could just come any time she wanted) if she knew we were going to be destroyed, wouldn't it be better if she arrived let's say.. 20 holy years ago so we could get ready?The doctor we watched die is suddenly not, and he acts even crazier than beforeThe queen is stupid enough to leave her ship and go get the Sphere by her self... did I miss something? Why didn't she send like all her troops, there was no need for her to expose like that, I thought she was smartAnd the list goes on and on, but I'll just stop here.Leaving the plot holes behind, the entire movie seems way too rush, everything happens really fast, the first movie had a good rhythm, we were slowly learning what was going on, and we had the time to ""feel"" worried.But in this one they just come, land somewhere, random destruction everywhere but it happens sooo fast that we don't even care, we don't even know what they destroyed, it's just... sad.3/10 1 point for the big ass ship 1 point because the lasers are phew phew 1 point just because-7 for all that I wrote",Independence Day - Resurgence
406,desertfox1942-178-876030,Bad movie. Don't pay for it.,4,30 July 2016,"Let me first say that I'm happy I didn't pay to watch it. I had one last movie card left that my colleagues gave me for Christmas. Now to the story itself. What can I say? First off, it leaves unanswered questions all the time besides the plot points that didn't make any sense at all.Why is ""Data"", the former President and the black war lord having their minds...controlled? If I can say that.How can a small Alien ball know everything that's necessary to defeat the Alien invaders but lose the war and then the inferior ""primitive"" humans can defeat them all of a sudden? Let me guess....because the script says so. OK. Here is more...How can the Queen survive a fusion bomb blast using her shield but then loses the shield by the much smaller and insignificant armament of an Alien fighter?Why does the Queen just hunt a bus on the desert when she has so many enemies in front of her?Why do the Alien fighters just fly around the Queen in a tornado formation instead of attacking the humans and get done with the job?How can President Whitmore fly a modern Jet fighter even though he can barely walk in the rest of the movie? Only the CGI shots are worth of something but they cannot save the whole movie anyway. Even there, we had scenes completely unnecessary like the one showing China being destroyed.And for the last line of this review I will leave the same complaint I leave pretty much every time nowadays. They HAD to include a gay couple to show us how much they struggle to be politically correct. Political correctness is destroying cinema.",Independence Day - Resurgence
407,tvsitcoms,It has all the ingredients of the 1st movie,8,20 August 2016,"I was surprised to see low scores for this movie. I guess the reason is people compared it to the trill of watching the 1st and that is just unfair, the novelty could not still exist.Saying this, I really enjoy it. It has all the same ingredients the other one as, even more. The line of writing is the same. Plot wise it brought back all main characters, killing the ones that could not come back for more (of course) and introducing new exciting ones. Sleazy dialogues? Well, go back and watch the 96's movie and you'll get sleaziness too. Probably more. Nothing is really missing: Bill Pullman's motivating speech (tacky in 96 and in 16) is still there. His presence is still strong and his character still gets reverenced has ""The"" president. You also have kids with some screen time, you get to see Judd Hirsch again, always funny and the dynamic with Jeff Goldblum is still enjoyable. There are tons of aliens and ships. Unlike that movie made by Spielberg and Cruise that was crappy has hell and gave no one an alien (except for Tom's face). Come on! No one can score that one better than this one.Special Effects are what we all got used to see and in the right measure: great, not ostentatious, not over the top, not fake looking. The acting of major roles and support ones is well done. In the end you still cheer for humans and you despised the Aliens. And when humankind wins... Well, maybe is too soon to celebrate? A new novelty comes in a sphere and I will not say more. I enjoy it. A good movie to see on TV, maybe more so than on the big screen, since I believe it must be more enjoyable to watch this lying in your comfortable couch than sitting in a movie theater pack with strangers probably kicking your chair, eating or answering phones. Pros: The original cast reunion (except you know who and I didn't miss him). The faithful character dynamicsCons: A noticeable effort to place Chinese dialogue and characters.(is too forced and both are weak)",Independence Day - Resurgence

Yes I should admit that the music and directing weren't top notch and it wasn't as moving as the first one but still if you like sci-fi movies you will like it. Just lower your expectations.Everything is relative, if this movie with this type of special effects was released 10 years ago it would have been amazing.We are so used to big budget movies with spectacular scenes that we want bigger, more breath-taking, more fantastic, more whatever instead of just enjoying a movie in the present moment as is.

409,jonas_bassforce,They did it again! Literally!,4,4 July 2016,"As I was, and still am a big fan of the original Independence Day, I just had to go and see this movie even though I didn't really believe it to be any good. And guess what? They did it again! Like with so many films before (""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" to mention one), they have yet again managed to make a sequel that is basically a ripoff of it's original movie. If Independence Day had been made today and with today's CGI-technology, it would probably look something like this. And that's the big problem: there is absolutely nothing new or groundbreaking about this movie at all. Nothing! When the original came out it told a story about hostile aliens trying to take over the planet, which wasn't a common movie theme in the 90's (at least not in any movie released in Sweden), and it had special effects that still holds up to this day. It was based in a somewhat realistic world where we had to deal with the aliens using the technology we had at the time. It had a great build-up, it had great actors, characters that you cared about because of their backstory and it never felt unnecessary or rushed at any point.This time however we have loads of new unrealistic equipment, thanks to the aliens. The story is based in a totally unrealistic world with all nations united in ""world peace"" (like that's ever going to happen?). And when the aliens return we still have no chance of beating them for some unexplained reason. So the whole story repeats itself again, only this time it feels extremely rushed and a lot of key elements are left unexplained. This time there is no build-up, no character development, flat comic relief characters that are in no way funny and the whole scenery is basically the same, even the environment the scenes are in. It's almost like Roland Emmerich suddenly found himself without money and said: ""Let's make Independence Day 2! People liked the first one, right? Does anybody still have the blueprint for that one?"" The whole thing is so focused on revisiting old story elements and action scenes that the only thing in the plot that is actually ""new"" falls between the cracks. There is too much that is made with CGI for my taste. For example the original movie had aliens that looked realistic because they were ""real"". This time they are generated through a computer which actually doesn't look realistic at all.But worst of all is that it's not only a ripoff of its original but the whole design is ripping off other sci-fi movies without shame. Somewhat shoe-horned in between all the action is a ""mystical"" orb that in the end miraculously is the one thing that can save the day (and set up future sequels). But wait, doesn't that thing look almost exactly like the front of the Discovery from ""2001- A Space Odyssey""? The alien ""queen"" concept has been dealt with too much already in the ""Alien"" franchise and feels worn out, not to mention she looks like the tripods from Spielbergs ""War Of the Worlds"".What's the point of making the same movie twice? Stop that immediately, you hear me Hollywood? If you haven't got a new exciting story to tell, please don't tell it! It's like listening to a demented relative telling you about their old memories over and over again, but exaggerating a little more each time.There are only two things that I found great about this movie:1. Jeff Goldblums reaction to their spaceship hitting an asteroid. It's hilarious! Where has he been for the last 20 years by the way?2. If you have got nothing better to do, it's actually a really entertaining Friday-night time-waster.But to be honest, it's probably more fun wasting time with the original.",Independence Day - Resurgence

She can stop being a brat now. The other new boys are also annoying. The new characters are forced and feel just completely out of place.

They were no doubt included to make IDR an ""International"" movie, but given that the original Independence Day was clearly an American movie, still a little grating. I want to call this tendency in recent movies the International ""Bass-O-Matic"" Effect.True, the plot imbues a vast and powerful (i.e. successful) alien intelligence with the tactical abilities of a five-year-old playing war in the front yard, but for me that thought came more on reflection as I mulled things over towards the end of the movie.One reviewer called the movie ""boring"", but in contrast I found that there were too many plot lines for the run-time of the movie, creating a busy muddle that prevented any of the plot lines from being fully developed.But, I still kind of liked watching the movie.If Independence Day was a juicy sirloin steak, then Independence Day Resurgence is a pretty good hamburger.",Independence Day - Resurgence
413,jenny-talksalot,Independence Day 2 - of 1,3,1 August 2016,"In a way this whole review is probably to be considered spoiler-ed - sorryI was very excited to see this film but was rather disappointed to sit through what seemed to be an Independence Day 'reboot'. It was fab to see all the old actors leading to a great nostalgic experience but the 'banter' was old and recycled.The film wasn't altogether disappointing - Whilst the story-line was rather bland and repetitive of ID1, the effects were superb. **SPOILER** The Sphere was a great idea and I felt it truly added depth to the story - but they did not explore that story enough. it would have been better for that to have been integrated more deeply and for it to have been a stronger focus for the story.It is my opinion they should have left it where it was 20 years ago - there was no real breakthrough for story-line; I found the interactions weak, and the technology leap in 20 years a little difficult to believe.This film would be perfect for someone who had not seen the first film.

The story line was so convoluted you didn't really know what, or who, was in the film. The introduction of new characters was quick and lacking in any information. There didn't seem to be much back story as to what happened to some of the other characters from the first movie - Will Smith's character Steven Hillard, and Margaret Colin's character Constance Spano, Miguel and other kiddo's of Russell's to name a few. Then they killed off another main character from the 1st movie without so much as a hello - didn't know why they even bothered to bring them back. The dialogue was bad, the story line had so many plot holes it was very hard to follow. Most of all, the movie was really lacking humor - something the first movie really excelled at.

415,Iron-Bat-Prime,"Independence Day, Reasurgence: ""There Coming Back...""",4,14 August 2016,"Rating 5.0, Mediocre Movie * There is one movie that makes every movie watcher feel like an American patriot; Independence Day(8.3). This alien invasion classic united nations on screen and off to defend against human extinction. Its astounding action shots, quotable dialogue and fantastic characters are so memorable, that there was never need for director Roland Emmerech to produce a sequel to his predecessor masterpiece. But they did... but why? Resurgence simply feels like a get together for the cast with some slap stick comedy in-between rather than a movie, and still they didn't invite Will Smith!? * Characters - Jake Morrison: What happened to the Hemsworth's this year? Ones comes here for the charm and the other goes to Ghostbusters(4.7) for the laughs...David Levinson: Jeff! You were the star if the 90's, what happened? Don't get me wrong you are a lovable guy, your acting here just sucked...Dylan Hiller: BRING-BACK-WILL-SMITH-FULL-STOP! President Witmore: At least Bill Paulman is back! I tell ya his speeches in both the original and sequel, easily make him a better president then soon to be Donald Trump... His death was awesome though ""Happy Fourth Of July!"" just awesome.Patrica Witmore: You can cry over your father little lady, if it was meant to be emotional? So boohoo for you, your stuck with Liam now.* Plot & Design: An unnecessary sequel developed an unnecessary story. So the 'queen' is here to finish the job. But didn't they destroy the 'mother ship?' The aliens did look good, but to be honest the old practical effects still looked just as good... The best thing about this movie is the destruction sequences themselves. They might look like a CGI mess but they truly depict how small mankind can be compared to the universe. It is a very entertaining visual sight, but when the movie has no soul nor true script to depict it's true meaning, its ends up pointless. So many characters died in this movie, you had no emotion! I'm OK with a with a humorous save the world movie, but your predecessor did not deliver this. The same director should deliver the same standard if not better.* I must say I'm kind of glad Will Smith left for Suicide Squad(8.0), because he nailed it again there.

417,jc-29071,Great action packed film Look forward to part 3!,8,8 January 2017,"I gave this movie a 4.5 for the same reason I gave part I the same rating, which I will mention below. First however I want to say that the blue ray version is excellent, colors are very nice, the sound mixing also good (although it could have made more use of that DTS-HD as some other films have such as the jungle book who truly utilized the surround channels effectively and noticeably. The set designs are beautifully rendered whether in the Area 51 bases or the alien mother ship (the concept of a alien ecosystem inside the mother ship was a nice touch, well done!), the examples of alien technology transforming the world was very well done, the mention of anti-gravity space crafts, and architecture is thought provoking, well done for giving us something to ponder. I would love to see more CGI in the next film, although the CGI in this film was money well spent and is glorious to look out (compliments to all the parties responsible, fantastic job!), The story line is very good, new twists and elements that I did not expect (and believe me I have seen just about everything and read everything so for you to surprise me is definitely a good thing, this is regarding the special surprise in the film, the rest of you will have to see the film to find out I am not going to tell you what it is but its good!)Okay this part for the Director Roland Emmerich please take note: As I mentioned the dialogue that the presidents make are cheesy, corny and propaganda-ish, please for part 3 while writing the screenplay with Woods, Devlin and Vanderbilt just take a closer look at how the real politicians, presidents talk regarding real world crisis and conflicts, its all pretty serious and straight forward, when inspirational speeches are made they touch on real issues and to the heart of the people. Besides that the story is well put together Goldblum's character mentions ""We're taking the fight to them"" Wow!, I look forward to part 3 and the element I spoke about above needs to be fully explored by Brent Spiner's character is very promising. I do hope you will get rid of that long hair, have him, Goldblum, Hemsworht, Fichtner and Pullman as well as Monroe's, and Jessie Usher's character's make the journey to battle the aliens. Do have Spiner's character be more intelligent and show us a more serious analytical scientist as he make his theories and test them, you can keep the goofiness but please just execute it intelligently to guarantee chuckles or laughs (he can pull both the intelligence and humor off, after all he was data in Star trek next generation). Fichtner and Pullman were both excellent please have Pullman somehow return in part 3 yes, and also the neurosis or anxiety can be handled better, with more finesse it will improve the presentation. Fichtner also handled his role excellently he needs to be leading the charge to battle the aliens, steals the movie with his performance. Sela Ward makes a great Madamme President,she has a presence that is compelling and interesting, bring her back in part 3. She also holds the key to exploit a very important part of the film that the world has come together and works as one to improve the human condition and to touch on how important and great such an event is and how it can lead to the next stage of human evolution, its a familiar theme in famous sci-fi stories but can be expounded on here, especially in part 3. Consequently there seems to me to be enough here if very carefully and artfully done, for a part 4! Goldblum, Hemsworth and Hirsch's characters and performance are great. I would love to see Hirsch's character interacting in more significant and meaningful situations, yet with that witty humor of his, to explain the human reaction to the aliens, or other situations with the kids from part one and making significant discoveries, Goldblum's character is his son so he has been exposed to special knowledge no one else has, this can make his role better. Do keep the humor between Goldblum and Hirsch's characters it works, just ensure that it's smart, witty humor to keep us chuckling, even if in part 3 it may have to be done over video conferencing, since Goldblum's character will be on a spacecraft and on the front lines as he needs to be, along with Hemsworth, Pullman, Fichtner, Spiner, Monroe and Jessie Ushers characters. I would love to see the rivalry between Usher's and Hemsworth characters be resolved and a strong teamwork between them, Monroe, Angela Yeung Wing, Fichtner and Pullman's team as a squadron should be electrifying. Hemsworth character needs to show us why he's the hero by leading the charge, put him in situations where he has to lead a small group of elite fighters into the enemy stronghold along with the other characters mentioned who are all an excellent group and have him share screen time in such a situation with Fichtner, Pullman and the others, on the ground on one of those excellent alien spacecraft sets looking for whatever they need and a throw down battle scene with many of these elite fighters under Pullman, Fichtner's and Hemsworth lead both on ground and leading aerial attacks, this is pure thrills and excitement if done carefully with great attention to details, lines and tight, choreographed battle scenes as you had in this movie. You are definitely on the right track, there is tremendous potential you have here, make it happen! see you in ID3! p.s. Will smith's character should be in part 3 even as a clone or hologram showing up a few times with important information.",Independence Day - Resurgence

It's OK. Buy your popcorn, giggle a bit.Is it worth the full price of tickets? Well, that's debatable. I went with my sister in law, she pretty much likes everything; I mean, it has to be HORRID before she'd complain about a movie. I think just the idea of sitting in that theater for a couple of hours and escaping the reality of the world around us is enough to justify pretty much any movie to her.But they tried too hard. And they tried too hard, too fast. The characters were poorly fleshed out, and just not interesting. The story was so full of holes And the ""we're going to make a third one!"" was shoved down the throats of everyone in the theater.Truly disappointing.

Yes again we have the pathetic, predictable ending, and it becomes quite clearly that this is a KIDS MOVIE. After bombing domestically at around $100 million with a budget of $165 million and reuniting the original writers I thought this was a shoe-in, but even with 5 writers you can build a nice pile of crap. The special effects were cool back then with landmarks blowing up and they didn't get weird with the ship designs, but the best part of this movie was the first half where you find out about the aftermath of the first and see a Earth that has integrated the alien technology, yet strangely looks exactly like ours I guess. If you want to enjoy this movie turn it off before the end because the IMPLAUSIBLE ending where they are circling around the queen not defending her (why would she go out anyway in a beehive she is protected and never leaves) as she gets blown to pieces.

421,ustheman,When You make 'Will Smith' Movie Without 'Will Smith',6,23 June 2016,"When the first one was released it was ahead of its time, something grand, something new but didn't take it self too seriously, it was a B-grade fun flick. Each character was identifiable. Will Smith was the Face of the movie. This sequel on the other hand, well ""not much you can expect when you decide to make a Will Smith movie without Will Smith"". It didn't the have soul, didn't feel unique, felt like any other modern day VFX popcorn flick. It had amazing scenes but forgettable. Even though I went in with lowest expectations, I still hoped it would do me wrong. My breakdown below.Acting: 5/10 (Geoff Goldblum is the only one worth admiring).Story: 3/10 (same story as first, no soul in characters or script, dialogue was clichéd).Action/VFX: 10/10 (This aspect you cannot dislike, you are left in awe in some scenes, clean CGI, no crazy fast cuts, and thank god no shaky cam).Theatre Experience: 10/10 (watched it in a Dolby Atmos cinema, George st Sydney, Event Cinemas, great experience, popcorn good, staff good as always in Sydney, comfy big seats).Value for Money: 5/10 ($25 ticket with clichéd dialogue and average acting, VFX just saves it from being utterly disappointed, though my disappointment started with the announcement of ""No Will Smith"" a year ago"").Nostalgia: 1/10 (This was a big disappointment, when making a sequel to a classic 20 years later, you expect some throw back feels, Jurassic World executed this extremely well).Recommendation: skip the Cinema, wait for Blu-Ray copy. You will appreciate it more. But if you really want to watch it go to a Dolby Atmos cinema to give you an immersive experience.Overall rating: 5.6/10 or 6 if I watched it on DVD",Independence Day - Resurgence

I wonder if they even had a proper script since it seems they simply filmed straight from the storyboard. The actors didn't have to spend many hours doing this movie. A lot of the run time was spent on CGI, a tool Emmerich seem to be using more and more to avoid having to actually direct actors and filming. The entire story could fit in a few sentences. This is a disaster of a movie. I feel sorry for some of the actors who now have their names connected to this sordid product.

426,acole0228,It's Just Bad,2,29 October 2017,"Roland Emmerich has never been one of my favorite filmmakers. Mainly that his films have always lacked nuance, intelligence, or anything worth saying. Usually at the very least Emmerich can make an entertaining film. The original Independence Day was and still is a good popcorn flick thanks to a nice pace, good action, and decent if not completely 2-dimensional ensemble cast.However, this movie is a giant mess. One of the bigger problems is that the cast is too big. Most of the cast from the first movie (with one of the notable exceptions being Will Smith) return in one way or another, but added on to that are a bunch of new characters (a lot I couldn't even remember until I looked at the cast and crew description) that aren't given enough time to develop. Apart from not caring about or knowing half the people in this movie, the other main problem is that the whole plot makes no sense. Why is there a moon base? How did everything get rebuilt so fast? How did they build a moon base so fast? Alien technology only goes so far when major cities get wiped out (which if I remember from the first movie was a lot of them).Thanks to this combination of boring, undeveloped characters and a convoluted, unintelligible plot, I can't even remember what happened in this movie. To be fair, I saw this movie quite a while back, but I don't think I could have described it with much detail then either. Apparently there will be an Independence Day 3 coming out. I will be staying far away.",Independence Day - Resurgence

Almost whatever you think of, it fails on that.Ironically it could have been a really good movie and that is what makes it so disappointing. It has all the elements in place. And it has some interesting concepts: an intergalactic war, an ally in the fight against the invaders, and attempts to crack the language of the aliens. But they really blew it.Much of the movie reminds me of those cheap cartoons with the angular drawing and boring scripts that they used to show after school on TV. If you picture the movie looking like one of these animations then suddenly it makes more sense. The key must be to have drastically lowered expectations.Many of the younger actors are very photogenic and it makes you wonder if they were chosen for their looks instead of their acting ability. And could they make the AI more boring? If that represents evolution beyond the biological then it's pretty pathetic evolution.This is not a movie that you will want to watch in one sitting.

431,imdb-duke_nukem,Purile Tripe,1,14 July 2020,"Earth is being invaded (again). The action cuts every few seconds between different locations so fast you don't know where you are half the time, they include Area 51, somewhere in Africa, Salt Lake, Washington, down a bunker, some big city that's being destroyed, the Moon, the control room of a ship somewhere, a prison for aliens, in a jungle inside the alien spaceship - usually with some kind of disaster going on.Seems the last invasion has united Earth into One World, albeit adopting American culture complete with politically correct operatics and speeches to brass-band music.The characters create zero empathy with the viewer. Everyone except Goldblum is over-acting like crazy. The pilots fly their space fighter craft with cowboy whoopees, and Brent Spiner, trying to act a nutty professor, comes over like Coco the Clown without the make-up. There is a feud between two of the pilots (I didn't catch why) and they are still yapping about it over the radio in the middle of dogfights with the aliens. There are some side-plot love stories that interrupt the height of the action but fail to create interest. The stupidity of some of the characters' actions is beyond belief.Towards the end, two idiot characters drive a school bus load of kids into the middle of the area set out for the showdown battle. Instead getting out as fast, they drive up to the feet of the gigantic Alien monster, apparently out of curiosity, and turn off the engine. The monster, which until then had been aiming to conquer the Universe, is now diverted into trying to squish a bus. It's ridiculous, but the kids on the bus are a clue about what age group this trash might appeal to.The only thing to do with this film is to ignore the plot and try to appreciate the technicalities of the CGI, which is almost non-stop - to the point of boredom.",Independence Day - Resurgence

433,Skruffbagg,As ridiculous as the first film.,6,23 June 2016,"It's another film I would class as half-decent. Utterly ridiculous, bombastic and jingoistic, but just as good as the first film.It's surprisingly not terrible.We pick up 20 years after the first invasion. Humanity has rebuilt and evolved thanks to the tech left over by the ""Harvesters"" - as they are now identified - and the world is looking forward to a good ol' knees up in celebration of the historical victory. This is when the proverbial excrement hits the fan.As in the first film, character development is sparse, and our heroes are as bland as they come. We even now have a Madam President, which is nice. She doesn't last long though. Ho hum.Saving the world is Military Hero #1 (white guy) and Military Hero #2 (black guy). Also there's a chick. She's got brains and skills. Obviously. We've also got Brent Spiner returning as the mad scientist in a much bigger & madder role, and Bill Pullman as the former POTUS, now a wee bit insane, but still able to deliver a rousing speech when called for.Jeff Goldblum remains eternally watchable, and has now graduated from ""cable repair man"" to ESD (Earth Space Defence) Director, but retains some of his wit. Judd Hirsch returns as his father and the Most Jewish Man Ever. Hilarity ensues.I suppose this is my main problem with this film. The ""jokes"" fall totally flat. They were hardly high-brow in the original, but they at the very least raised a titter. In this they don't. What we're mostly here for is to see the Earth get absolutely smashed the s**t right out of, and boy oh boy does that happen. When the Burj Khalifa smacks right into the London Eye (what? yeah) Goldblum quips a joke. I snorted in derision. This is the funniest line in the movie. Mass death is hilarious to these people.Naturally, due the the humans now having advanced technology, they quickly figure out how to seriously kick some alien ass, and I was a little disappointed at how easily they did. The ending, while very, VERY similar to ID4 is actually pretty good. But dumb. Really, really dumb. The whole movie is. Do not try to make sense of anything that is happening on screen. If you do, you may start to feel your brain dribbling out of your ears.You can consider this review mostly hyperbole, as I was actually looking forward to this film. Truly, it doesn't disappoint. It's dumb as a box of rocks, has awful characterisation and - when thoughtfully considered - is exactly the same film all over again, but it does what it says on the tin. It's better than average and you know what? I had a blast. Lots of people love the original, and I'd imagine most will enjoy this too. I'll no doubt purchase this on Blu Ray when it becomes available because, I kinda love bad films that try really hard, and this is exactly what Independence Day: Resurgence does.

435,declankearns-24728,More of a remake than a sequel,6,3 December 2016,"I got a chance to watch this film five months ago. At first I thought that it was going to be better than the previous one. However, it just didn't turn out good.First off, the plot takes place 20 years after the first invasion. Where the whole world, except the Democratic Republic of Congo, has become a futuristic society. David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), during a peacekeeping mission in Congo, has discovered that the aliens sent a distress call before the first invasion was destroyed. The aliens arrive in a big ass ship the size of USA which uproots several major Asian cities and dumps them on Europe and starts drilling a hole to the Earth's core. The ESD launches a counter attack on the ship which fails and Liam Hemsworth, Jessie Usher and a few others survive; they later hijack two attacker crafts and follow the queen's personal ship. Former President Whitmore (Bill Pullman) goes on a suicide mission to destroy the ship, it works. However the queen survives. Patrica Whitmore (Maika Monroe) in her jet rapidly fires at the queen's shield disabling her shields. Meanwhile, Jeff Goldblum and Hudd Hirsch (Julius Levinson)try to protect a bus full of kids. Liam and his friends manage to kill the queen in time before she tries to steal the sphere and the ship's generator deactivate; the harvester ship flees. Everyone and even Dikembe Umbutu (Deobia Oparei)(forgot to mention him earlier). Dr Okrun reveals that the sphere has offered humanity new technology in which they take the fight to aliens' home planet.Secondly, most of the characters felt one dimensional,especially with the absence of Will Smith. Personally, the only likable characters were Liam Hemsworth, Jeff Goldblum, Deobia Oparei and Hudd Hirsch. I thought Okrun died in the first one.Gave it a 6 out of 10 rating because it is not as bad as Roland Emmerich's misfires like 10000 BC.",Independence Day - Resurgence

437,skydragon-4,Great flick as long as you don't expect too much,9,3 August 2016,"I was 16 years of age when the original Independence Day movie was released in cinemas. I had watched all the awesome TV spots and was hyped to see that movie. Sure, the first hour or so was epic but, in my view, it was all downhill from there. I persisted and watched it right to the really lame ending whereby a virus is uploaded to the mothership. Bought the VHS copy as soon as it released (So my parents and all could watch it) and it's safe to say that, after the initial explosions and stuff, we forwarded large parts of the rest of the movie because it was, to be frank, boring. At this point, I accepted that I expected too much from this movie. I expected something coherent when watching it but all it turned out to be was a movie with lots of explosions and action and stuff which isn't a bad thing but I expected something more realistic and that was my mistake.Fast forward almost two decades later and a sequel was announced. Can't say that I was particularly fond of the news but nevertheless accepted it. However, the first trailer blew me away with the immense scope (The size of the f'ing mothership.. Jesus). As the release date came, I booked and watched it in the cinema. I can honestly say that it surprised me because, for some reason, I was hooked from beginning to end. Now, let me tell you, I've watched many Sci-Fi movies and TV series and my favourites include Stargate, BSG, TNG etc so I was actually taken aback by just how much I enjoyed this movie. I shouldn't be enjoying it but I am - Why? I just didn't know. The scenes showing the motherships arrival was jaw-dropping, literally, and I can't wait to watch all that stuff on BluRay in the future. I only realised that my mouth was open at the end of that entire segment because it just looked so damn awesome seeing the mothership landing on Earth, especially the bit with it extending its ""legs""(?) but wow. I left the cinema completely satisfied.As I arrived home, I thought about why I enjoyed the movie. Sure, it was cheesy and made me roll my eyes sometimes but then I realised something crucial - I didn't expect much to begin with. I expected some rehashed trash of the original Independence Day and unoriginal stuff like the new Star Wars movie. If your bar is set low to begin with - At worst, you leave the cinema just as you entered and, at best, you leave surprised. I was the latter. I didn't expect an intelligent plot like Blade Runner or Inception but expected some interesting things to see but even that surpassed what I thought I would see visually. I didn't sit there looking for plot holes or inconsistencies - I just sat there watching a movie and turned my brain off while doing so. And it turned out to be the right decision because the movie isn't trying to be something that the majority of whiners are complaining about. It's like going to watch a Transformers movie and then complaining about how unrealistic Transformers are to begin with. The movie is just a summer blockbuster that's just interested in showing some over-the-top CGI, big explosions and some overarching story about defeating the bad guys again. End of.

I found it interesting in the trivia about the movie that Devlin was given a large sum of money to write a sequel, what he wrote wasn't good enough and gave the money back! It stated he thought 15 years later that it was OK, my thought, he needed the money back. I am a fan of Devlin and Emmerich collaboratorations and had great hopes for the sequel. I knew nothing about its ratings, I should have checked. I thought the story line a mess, nothing seemed to make sense. The dialogue was utterly horrible from people who are not strangers to screen writing, painfully horrible. I often wonder if actors in the middle of filming realize what they are filming is awful? This line of dialogue is stupid, does my character really have to say this and be such a buffoon, I have Dr. Okun comes to mind along with Judd Hirsch. Here he is speeding across the salt flats, he ends up just where Goldblums character just happens to be. The girl traveling with him says ""there's a tall gangly man waving you down over there!"" Seriously, who says that while speeding in a bus on a salt flat with aliens in the neighborhood? I really hated this movie. Another implausible scene, the ex presidents daughter has crash landed, the Queen is destroyed, she sees movement in the smoke, draws her weapon, out pops Hemsworth looking picture perfect right where she happens to be!

The dialogues of this film is so ridiculous I'm not even sure I can attribute that to poor writing. Because it seems they deliberately want the movie to sound ridiculous. This is also one of the movies where I've seen the most pointless, unnecessary, and unlikable characters. There were literally ppl thrown into this film just for occasional one liners and do nothing else for the plot. It's like amidst everything they were also trying to mix in a 90's sitcom vibe.

444,devilsadvocatered6,Middle of the Road,6,21 July 2016,"Just like the first Independence Day, this movie is a bit of big, dumb fun. What hurts it for me is that there are way too many side characters that could have easily been cut out of the movie. The movie shifts drastically in tone between one cut and the next. You'll go from mourning loss to action to comedy and back to tragedy again all within the space of a few minutes.On the other hand, there's a lot of explosions and action. Isn't that exactly what you want to see this movie for? It delivers on that front, in spades. Just don't leave your brain turned on because you're going to see science get slapped in the face like it owes a street pimp money. Just like the first movie, I suppose.All in all, it wasn't worth the 20 year wait. It could have overcome its limitations if it took its time a little more, focused on a smaller cast and built up to the final confrontation. Instead, the movie is disjointed and messy like it was passed around from writer to writer. Nobody seemed to want to really flesh the ideas out, though.For example, there could have been a whole movie that takes place in the alien ship where a team of pilots crash land. There's an alien AI running around whose creator species also encountered the aliens that invaded Earth 20 years ago. Either of these are enough to tell an interesting story, but they are pushed to the wayside by the numerous side characters who contribute next to nothing.In conclusion: rent it when you can. Otherwise, don't worry. You're not missing much. Better yet, play XCOM.",Independence Day - Resurgence

You've got the hot Hemsworth who's rebellious, the president's (former president's) daughter, the righteous son who has famous parents, the crazy scientist, the weird Goldblum character (who may think he's still in 1996). THAT'S JUST A HANDFUL OF CHARACTERS.Returning characters, what I liked about the returning characters, is that they've had repurcussions from the first film, Goldblum stayed as Goldblum, but the Former President Whitmore, he's not the same man who made that roaring speech, the crazy doctor was funny sometimes, not always, but sometimes. I went to the bathroom, in the middle of a quiet moment & realised I missed nothing, I knew what I missed, I picked that moment because it was obvious & dull & there was a failed heart to heart.But while the film wasn't the best ever, it was full of clichés, failed attempts at characters & storytelling, the movie is fun to watch, it won't ruin your day, unless your a die-hard fan of the franchise.",Independence Day - Resurgence
446,blakelockett45,Endlessly cheesy and endlessly entertaining.,5,23 June 2016,"Independence Day: Resurgence is an over the top B movie with a big budget. It nevertheless embraces it's campy nature much like the first did. The absence of Will Smith leaves something to be desired and some of the quips don't quite land in moments. Even though Roland Emmerich has never been an actors director, I definitely recall the first one having much better acting and dialog. There are a few phoned in performances here. One with actor Jeff Goldblum going into ""Lost World"" territory having to fill the shoes of the absent leading man, this time Will Smith. All this being said I was not board in the movie and if you're willing to suspend logic, then you will find yourself having a good time. The effects are great and on par with the first. I do however miss those models and practical effects a little bit. The movie looks a lot more sleek and darker at times, which works in some parts but looses the look and feel of the first often. All in all, I cant help but feel this was a 90's nostalgia cash grab with some entertaining sequences and effects. It could have been a lot better, but it feels harmless and fun at the same time 5 stars out of ten",Independence Day - Resurgence

Perhaps by adding less American flags this time? Or maybe by broadcasting a shorter global message of hope with a similar tacky speech? Surely better special effectsthen what else?... a total disappointment.Glad to see Jeff Goldblum, Judd Hirsch and Brent Spiner for their active contributions to the movie. I can't believe Vivica A. Fox participated to it too, even if for a few scenes, how great seeing her character having become a nurse instead of still being an exotic dancer! Some of the new cast additions are also believable, like Jessie T. Usher who didn't over-act like his predecessor Will Smith and Charlotte Gainsbourg for her lovely French/British accent and full of life acting.Yet let's not forget the bad casting choices: Maika Monroe (neither facial emotion nor charisma, how did she end up in this movie?!!), Sela Ward (a talentless impersonated US female president) and Angelababy (her character was dumb).

448,ssnape3,They had 20 years to prepare and they messed it all up.,6,29 June 2016,"Let me start out by saying that I loved the original Independence Day, I know it is one of those movies that people either loved or hated, but I loved it and it remains one of my favorite films of the 90's - so I was excited about Resurgence, even though I am aware of Hollywood's history with sequels and remakes, but though I went in really wanting to like it, I came away from it disappointed.Independence Day: Resurgence was just a convoluted mess from the beginning, with characters jumping back and fourth from the Moon like it was going across the street to get a soda - then once the Aliens showed up the film looses all of its focus with a disjointed story that made it hard tell what was going on or why, for the people who thought the originals computer virus ending was ridiculous, I hope that they get a chance to see this film to see what true ridiculousness looks like - even the city destroying part, which should have been a slam dunk, was done in such a way that you couldn't even tell what city was being destroyed.It was nice seeing returning characters such as Bill Pullman, Judd Hirsch and Jeff Goldblum, but the new characters didn't really add anything and it seemed like the casting was looking more at the international box office than creating strong rootable characters like there were in the original - and just repeating some of the lines from the first film didn't cut it.As usual with a lot of sequels and remakes they were so intent on making this film bigger and better, stuffing it with overdone CGI and making it look cool for 3-D - that they forgot what made the original so good - which at is core was a pretty simple story of people banding together to survive an impossible situation, and for all the global destruction, the original had a keen sense of humor that never let it take itself to seriously - this film gets bogged down in it's own self seriousness.To be sure there were some moments to enjoy - hearing the original soundtrack was great, and the Queen Alien was well created, I also like Judd Hirsch and Jeff Goldblum bantering again, although there was far to little of it, but on the whole this film lack everything that made the original such a fun film to watch every Fourth of July - they didn't even get this film released on Fourth of July weekend like the original - they made mention at the end of a possible 2nd sequel, but after this half baked mess I would hope they forget about that idea.",Independence Day - Resurgence

The Queen's size is massive, and the look of the aliens NOW is way more disturbing yet extremely reminiscent of ID4's aliens, as they are the same race as in '96. More advanced. More terrifying. The action in this film is outstanding. The special effects in this film are outstanding. I saw ID4 in theaters a total of 13 times, I couldn't get enough. ID4 helped me get through a really bad time in my life so it will always be treasured to me. Resurgence brought back some beautiful memories for me so I value this sequel as well.

Looking back at the golden age of films before the 90s, movies were more than entertaining to moviegoers across the world without little or no CGI. But now, things have gotten out of hand, and too much special effects in one movie can ruin it very quickly. Luckily, Independence Day: Resurgence pushes to outlaw that. In recent behind-the-scenes interviews on the films' Blu-Ray release, Roland Emmerich was really torn on today's special effect technology, and did the best he could to bring actual-life sets to life. But, you couldn't really tell in the final cut of the film, with so much CGI being played over the original footage.The film itself has a great story line, but is a little too predictable. Cut out some punch lines and some unnecessary dialogue and you have a great script! But, the film doesn't quite do just that, and Liam Hemsworth's character is a bit too much. One thing that is truly remarkable about the film itself is it's ability to bring back original characters from the first film.This is a must-see if you were a fan of the original, and I tip my hat off to everyone's amazing dedication to this well though out film.",Independence Day - Resurgence

They are missing the point. Yes, there are many ridiculous coincidences, but they are consistent with the elements established within the movie.

458,hiucheekeong,20 years to come out with this crap ?,4,25 June 2016,"20 years to come out with this crap ? The core concept of independence day 1 is the contrast of human primitive current technology vs alien's high tech devastating technology, and how the underdog against all the odd to beat the high tech alien. But in this ID2, the first few scenes that human are using alien's spaceship, completely destroyed the core concept of ID1. And too many characters, none of them interesting, too many talking that nobody cares, all over the places, completely wasting scene time. i really hope the alien just blow them all up for good. At the beginning of the movie, when the cube came, and the hero said it was a mistake to blown it, you would have roughly idea how the alien would be defeated. While the alien mothership is bigger, more devastating, but the destruction scenes are too fast, camera shot too wide and far away, hence no excitement and not much emotion into it, lack the punch. The most weakest link is the story itself, they should have just faithful to the core concept of ID1, instead of bring in alien vs alien and all those human alien tech, completely ruin the movie.

459,fdiorico,It's not the best but I enjoyed it out of pure nostalgia.,9,21 July 2016,"So, I understand why many people don't like this film. I saw the first one as a kid. It was a time when personal technology was coming to everyone. The world was getting smaller. As a young boy, the first film actually inspired me to thirst for knowledge in science. I eventually became a physicist and if I do things right soon I will get my PhD. It was this first Independence day film, Contact and few other movies sci- fi films that I saw when I was young that inspired me in my current career path. So watching, the sequel is a massive nostalgia for me. I know... The plot is not the best. Too many clichés.... But come on... Aliens! Pew pew pew!!! I definitely enjoyed it. It's definitely a feel good movie so to speak. It is what it is. I would watch it again. I wouldn't even mind seeing the a 3rd sequel where the battle becomes galactic with the the good alien's help. Anyway, I'm scoring it 9 out of 10 because I'm judging it based on how I would have reacted years ago if I saw this film immediately after the first one. It's a film that children nowadays would probably love.If you're looking for some complex brilliant sci-fi film, then this isn't the film for you. Go watch Europa Report or Interstellar.

460,jrv1964,"Over blown action thriller, that does not hit the spot and requires too much suspension of disbelief",5,30 June 2016,"In the first 10 minutes of the movie, I found that for most people, too much ""suspension of disbelief"" has to be left at the front door of the cinema. I found the movie to be too futuristic to be set 20 years latter from 1996 to 2016, the harvested alien technology and it's use by man makes 2016 look like something out of Star Trek, it does not hold water to be accepted as the modern day and there are many plot holes hence my opinion ""too much suspension of disbelief"" is required to watch this movie. Yes, it has great action sequences and out of this world CGI but for it to depict the World in 2016 as some kind of futuristic utopia complete with all the ""fly me to the moon everyday technology"" does not wash. The theater goer is going to have to accept this movie is happening in a completely different parallel universe and disconnect completely from the reality of today. For me the plot, the futurism did not hit the spot and it has not stayed faithful to the original ID4 movie of 1996. It was made to bring in the audiences for the big bang of the CGI effects and too make money and for intelligent people, they are going to find this movie very corny, unbelievable and shallow.

It also lacks compassion or solicitude as human after human gets crushed, killed or possessed by aliens, resulting in the film feel tonally misplaced and misguided. I mean, I see the American optimism and can let it pass by, but the upbeat nature throughout just does not sit right.

Even Arnie's terminator would sound like a sophisticated, verbose, hotshot, if they had hired these writers.Finally, I'd like to thank the cast who were in no way wooden or simply bloody awful actors.

466,mjpetty7,"The Skies are Falling, and it's Independence Day, Again.",7,24 June 2016,"So just last night I was at the double feature Independence Day showing the original ID4 along with Resurgence right after and I have to admit that I enjoyed IDR quite a bit. I think the problem many people have with the film is that it comes off of a big classic such as Independence Day that many general audience moviegoers actually really enjoy. I mean, my Mom isn't a sci-fi fan at all, but she knows almost every line in ID4 and loves the film. On the other hand, I am a huge sci-fi fan and I also love the original film and hold it in high regard.One of the problems with today's movie-going audience, and maybe I should just say today's movie critics both professional and armature, is that they often have too high of expectations for any movie that comes out. Had the original Independence Day been released today instead of 20 years ago, it would be ripped to shreds. So would films like Ghostbusters, Close Encounters, The Terminator, Aliens, and probably even the original Star Wars, but at the time they were revolutionary, cutting-edge, and new. Nowadays there are so many B- films that so many people just write-off because they don't see the potential or had too high of expectations going in. We all expect every movie to be as entertaining as The Avengers, as compelling as Inception, or as character driven as Shawshank Redemption, but the truth is that a movie is a movie and ultimately art is subjective, and film is art.But with that out of the way, let's talk about Independence Day: Resurgence. Resurgence takes place 20 years after the original film and kind of just jumps right into the action. The basics are that one of the Alien Queen's has decided to attack Earth and suck up all its resources in retaliation for their original defeat 20 years ago, while Earth has used become united under the UN and has used alien tech to advance their planet for intergalactic warfare if necessary.One of my favorite parts of this film was how the original cast was used. Between David now being a part of Earth's defense and discovering the original alien drill (which hadn't been researched in the last 20 years apparently though they do explain why), to President Whitmore having visions of the aliens and their plan, even to Dr. Okun returning from his 20 year coma and helping fight the aliens once again, everyone that was brought back worked well within the context of the story.The new cast also did a good job, and I enjoyed the return of characters from the original as well. One thing Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin get, in my opinion, is characters, it's just their specialty. You can have a big, great story like ID4 but if you don't have Goldblum or Will Smith to lead the film and to be full-fledged characters it's not going to mean anything because we don't care. Like I said before, I think the new characters worked, but I wish that they will a little more fleshed out so that we cared a bit more, but with the old cast returning it would've been hard to do.Resurgence did a good job at raising the stakes from the first movie, while the last film had many ships all over the globe bent on wiping out humanity, this film had one big ship covering half the Earth, bent on collecting all of Earth's resources, while the Queen and her ship went looking for their Enemy (who became Earth's ally).I will say there were a lot of themes or plot lines I did not like from IDR. Hollywood keeps promoting this global government agenda and IDR continues that trend with the UN basically being a one world government. Dr. Okun having a relationship with his lab partner was obviously another agenda that Hollywood has been shoving down our throats that I don't care for at all. Then of course the transhumanist agenda was also being pushed, the idea that the other alien that comes to Earth to help humanity was once an organic lifeform decided to transcend its body by becoming a digital lifeform. This is another agenda that has been circulating throughout the media and quite frankly I can see why based on how technology obsessed America is as a nation. It's sad really.As I said before I really had a good time. It also sets up a third film that looks to be completely set in outer-space, which would be an awesome way to make another Independence Day film different from the original, and even this sequel. One thing I told my brother while we were in the theater was that the movie really seemed like it should have been a video game, and I still hold to that thought. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but I definitely think that this film played out like a video game would. Maybe I'm wrong. Either way, many of the themes and story concepts that I had wanted to TNT series Falling Skies to introduce (intergalactic war, space battles, natural resource draining, alien queens, etc.) actually seemed to be either used or set-up in this movie, which was oddly satisfying for me as a sci-fi fan and as someone who wanted the Independence Day franchise to continue on in the future.All-in-all, I really enjoyed Independence Day: Resurgence. Fans of the original film may either hate it or love it, it honestly depends on how big into science-fiction they are in my opinion, and new fans who are starting out with this film can jump on no-problem. There's something in it for everyone and at the end of the day I was satisfied and highly anticipating a sequel.",Independence Day - Resurgence

It does bog down in a few places but overall, I enjoyed most of the movie. How can you not help but root for Earthlings fighting to save the planet from the aliens? Most of the reviews criticize character development, but what I took from the movie is that there will be much more development as there will probably have to be at least 2 more movies so Earth can help the planet of refugees survive. My advice to everyone is take a chill pill and make your own movie if you are not happy with the Hollywood machine.",Independence Day - Resurgence
468,NoloContendere,Such a sad missed opportunity,3,6 July 2016,"ID:R is likely to remembered in the same vein as Highlander 2, Aliens: Resurrection, or any number of other sequels that failed to live up to their predecessors. While it showed promise in the beginning -- such as showing how humanity had incorporated the alien technology into our lives -- this promise was wasted very early on in the film. While some veteran actors returned for the film, far too many of the younger actors were obviously chosen because they were photogenic, not because they can act (which, sadly, they mostly can't). Will Smith's buoying energy was sorely missed.The first and foremost problem with the film was the writing. A committee of five wrote the movie, and it shows in the disjointed plot and frenetic pacing of the film. The audience is raced from one plot line to another, leaving unanswered questions that are never truly resolved, hinting at character relationships that are never explored, and feeling more like watching an extended cutscene from an XBOX game rather than a feature film. Characters enter and exit too quickly for the audience to form any type of attachment, such as a station wagon full of kids who randomly weave in and out of the picture.There is far too much reliance on cheap melodrama; this person has to watch his parents die, then that person does, then this one, until the audience really gets the point that this situation is *serious*. The overall effect was to create a shallow, one-dimensional character pool that might as well have been CGI sprites like the aliens themselves, so little did they contribute to the film. The writing committee even tried to cram in two Presidential rallying speeches instead of the first film's one. There was also the subplot of a second alien species that was nonsensical at best; at worst, it detracted from the struggle between humanity and the invaders.The direction is the next problem area. Again, the film was marred by too much melodrama with too little substance, and the interplay between human interaction and CGI effects was not seamless, as it should be in modern cinema, but jarring. There were far too many scenes where the CGI team was obviously operating without adult supervision, resulting in overwhelming scenes of chaos and destruction that did next to nothing to advance the plot. For example, while the notion of a spaceship so large it has its own gravity field was interesting, in the end it only served as a pretext to show the Petronas Towers being dropped onto London's Tower Bridge. You know, the kind of wanton destruction usually associated with toddlers playing with sand castles at the beach.Too many things in the film didn't make any sense. Yes, this is science fiction, but even sci-fi can feel like it follows certain logic. In ID:R, why would aircraft using anti-gravity drives need wings? Why would aliens who can drill through to the core of a planet in mere hours have to resort to an assault on foot of the NORAD bunker at Cheyenne Mountain? Why, assuming that the Presidential line of succession is similar to today's, would the President's entire Cabinet be with her at Cheyenne Mountain, such that the Presidency eventually falls to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs? Was there some intricate strategy for fighting the aliens that required the President to have her Secretaries of Education, Agriculture, and Commerce at her immediate disposal? How did one character on a small boat survive a tsunami that appeared to be hundreds of feet high and destroyed massive container ships? Why, after all sorts of ordnance being lobbed at the Mother Alien's shields, did it just take one fighter pilot screaming while shooting to finally breach them? Did the other pilots just not want it bad enough? While I realize that the original ID4 had its own flaws (hacking the operating system of an alien mothership in minutes from a 486 laptop, anyone?), the longer I watched ID:R, the worse it got.Overall, the film was a mediocre CGI fest with some actors thrown in to make it an official movie. The writing and direction were poor, the pacing was too forced, and a coherent plot was sorely lacking.",Independence Day - Resurgence

However, after a 20 year gap and with Will Smith leaving, we might have been able to spot this one from a distance. However, it turned out to be more of an abomination than I had expected.1. The acting was absolutely terrible and most of the characters seemed to serve no actual purpose. Two of them were there to serve no purpose other than to be Chinese, to tell the truth. 2.The effects were so see through even my dad could have seen through them and the editing looks like the director left his laptop open for his dog to do it. The direction is equally ridiculous and contributes to the overall stupidity of the movie. 3. The script used words which literally don't exist in science and have been made up to make the people who made the movie sound like they did some research. Also had too much 'initiate' and 'sequence' etc. 4. Most of the budget looks like it was spent on developing the 3D effects of the movie so you can see the dramatic failure in even more detail. However the 3D cinematography is good as a result :). 5. The plot was predictable from the moment the ******SPOILER ALERT****** aliens started coming. Its pretty much Independence Day but with 100 times more aliens and no Will Smith. The ending is exactly the same as independence day except for the additional 15 minutes at the end where everybody realises what a c**p movie they have made and starts scrambling to fix it without spending another $165 million.*******END SPOILER*********Overall the goal of this movie was to use 3D and over-long action sequences over an unoriginal plot and bad everything else to make gullible people and fans of Independence Day give the directors their money only to leave the theatre wondering what other movie they can then watch to get this out of their system.DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. But that probably wont stop you. By the way they're going to make a third one judging from the ending. Oh no.",Independence Day - Resurgence
470,sosmetallin,"Give this movie a chance, but with the right expectations",7,14 November 2016,"Independence day: Resurgence is the sequel to the well-known Independence day(1996). Like the first one, it is directed by Roland Emmerich and almost everyone from the old cast has returned along with a lot of new characters. A plot synopsis would be simple: 20 years after the invasion humanity is still united and used alien technology to improve their defenses and life on earth generally. The aliens return and this time they have gotten serious. It's a movie rated 5,3 so I will not talk very much about its problems(I will but I don't want to give the most emphasis there), because everything that was to be said has already been said. I'll be focusing on the strengths of the movie and what you should to do to be able to enjoy it. So, let us begin.Something basic about film reviewing is that a movie is rated and judged differently depending on its genre. And that's what I did. However, I acknowledged that this is not just an action/sci-fi, but a sub-genre: destruction movie. This category includes: San Andreas(2015), 2012, Armageddon, Godzilla(1998) etc. Furthermore, it's a sequel. Why am I saying all these? Because wrong expectations kill the movie experience and then an unfair review follows by the same person. Some people out there expected clever dialogue and deep meanings. Let's see, however, how much Roland Emmerich tried to satisfy a destruction fan. Good visual effects: check! Actually, good is an understatement. They are perfect. Although, the movie is full of CGI, never do you feel like you watch something fake. And given the size of this thing and what happens we get to see really impressing images. Moreover, there is no shaky camera to be found! Every shot is wide and made to be pleasing to the eye. Moving on to heroic acts...check! There are a couple of them and they are impressive as to be expected. Comic relief: check! I have to say they are not so effective as Marvel's jokes, but at least a few of them should land and what they also manage is to make the characters more likable. Tribute to previous movie: check! This is not for the destruction fans in general, it's for the classic Independence day fans (which I suppose are a big portion of the audience). Most old characters are back, along with our beloved Jeff Goldblum, who gives a great performance once more and has some nice lines. It's kind of nostalgic to see them again in action. So, that's pretty much what I found to be a strength for a destruction movie. Now, let's talk about what he did not. Unfortunately, Mr Emmerich didn't really try to make likable enough characters. As I said, because of the comic relief you may like one or two, but they are not so well developed. Generally, they are overshadowed by the old cast and some of them are...not needed. There is an over-abundance of characters! Why is this bad? Because there is not enough time to make them all likable. Pretty much everybody will get in danger at some point so if they are not likable, how are you supposed to get excited in an action scene? Plus, it destroys the pacing given that the movie needs to not let a scene get too long so that we can see what every character does. So don't expect very long action scenes, except for the last one. By the way, it's my favorite one of the movie. And luckily it is much different than the previous one. All these above mean that we have a beautiful movie with inadequate emotional depth.Character and pacing problems are quite serious, but here's what you can do to have a good time. Step 1: Remember it's big dump fun. It's an eye candy, not a clever sci-fi with sophisticated theories and deep dialogue. Step 2: Watch it on a 35+ inches screen (its obvious why). Step 3: Don't watch it after a clever movie. Step 4: Maybe call some friends. With this review I hope to help people see this movie with the point of view I saw it. To be honest it's not one of my favorites, but at least I didn't hate it like some others. Have fun.",Independence Day - Resurgence

Resurgence Review,8,24 August 2016,"Greetings Fans, Now some of you Are familiar with the Disaster Movie Director Roland Emmerich, The Man behind The Day After Tomorrow, 2012, 10'000 B.C., And GODZILLA (1998) (Yeah he prefers to keep that movie in his Talk about it later list) But perhaps the Movie that gave him the End of the World Movie Director, Independence Day, But I'm on about it's sequel today, called Independence Day: Resurgence, It took Mr. Emmerich along time to come up with a Sequel to his 1996 movie, And now here it is, This is what the Fans have been waiting for a long time for, Now if you look at this poster You'll see that This piece of Art, You'd think that Is that Giant Alien ship gonna blow up the Earth well I recommend you see the movie, Mr. Emmerick would not End the World like that! Even he is human, And if you are wondering why it says ""We had twenty years to prepare, So did they."" Well this movie takes place 20 years after the first movie (Since the First Movie was released in 1996), Now the cast from the first on returns in this movie with some new ones. Jeff Goldblum returns as David Levinson, a scientist, MIT-educated computer expert, and environmental activist. I liked the guy back in the first movie and I still like him in this. Bill Pullman returns as Thomas J. Whitmore, You know the President from the first movie, but now it's Sela Ward as President Elizabeth Lanford, Will Smith who played Steven Hiller in the first movie is sadly not in this due to the movie claiming that he was killed off (Dad thinks he couldn't be in the movie because he wanted money and the Fox got greedy) but Jessie Usher play his son Dylan Dubrow-Hiller, Liam Hemsworth as Jake Morrison, a U.S. pilot serving as a lieutenant in ESD. I found him new to the Independence Day movie series but he was alright, Judd Hirsch also returns ad Davids father, Julius Levinson.I've been to see this with my Dad, And in my opinion, I'm impressed with this movie even Dad liked it, I can see where Roland Emmerich's money went with the Effects making his Previous world look like Money Grabs, The writing in this movie was not messing around with the 20 years in preparing part, It felt like a Stargate and Battlestar Galactica movie, I've also learned some stuff in this movie, The Aliens in this and the previous movie are called Harvesters, Which is interesting and there is a story-line in this that expands on the possible lore, In my opinion I'm getting the idea that this is left open for another Independence Day movie, I think Roland Emmerich is planning on doing an Independence Day Film Trilogy with how the movie is played out, Even though I give this movie 8 out of 10, And I recommend it if you are a fan of the Independence Day movie, You might like it.P.S. I promise to cover the first movie in the future.",Independence Day - Resurgence

You have probably seen tens of movies like this and this one does not bring anything new to the table.I almost fell asleep and waited for this disaster to actually finish. 3 stars for special effects as they are quite good but not enough to save the movie.Stay away, your money and especially time can be better spent.",Independence Day - Resurgence
473,colinrfricke,A poor follow up to the greatest alien movie ever,4,7 September 2019,"This movie sucks compared to the original, which in my opinion is the greatest alien movie ever. Stand alone it is ok. The story has enormous plot holes, poor character arcs, and cheesy dialogue. Some plot holes include: why are they drilling to our core to destroy the planet? If they wanted our planet for resources it defeats the purpose. If the space ball was so smart and had the secret to defeating the aliens, why did they get wiped out? Why did the Queen have thousands of ships around her but they did nothing when we fired on her?? There are plenty more.Second, the Chinese propaganda is almost nauseating. Hollywood, in all their wokeness, forgot that they are praising what is basically an authoritarian regime. To be fair, reverse engineering is what the Chinese do best...There is no real plot or character development. The aliens come but there is no real calculated escalation like the first one, there is just plain mayhem. The characters make no sense to me either. Why did I need to know Professor Okin was gay? His boyfriend had no purpose to the movie at all. Even Okins character jumped all over with little real reason. Also what happened to Goldblums ex wife from the first one? She was never even mentioned.The redeeming qualities are that the action is really fun. We get to see some ground action vs just areal battles in the first one. The air battles are cool as well. They also did a good job throwing back to some nostalgic characters from the original.",Independence Day - Resurgence

It has a lot of the same vibe and it is a good movie! It might not be shawshank redemption good. But for its genre its pretty good. I liked the CGI and the actors. And Jeff Goldblum is still funny and awesome. Yes it has a few errors and stuff that you after the movie will think: Hey why did they not have this and this? And what about this? But most movies today have that so that's nothing new. Most movies will have that and movie makers cant think of everything. Look at yourself? Do you always think of everything? No probably not. I liked the movie. It was funny and full of great action. And it could end up being a very awesome series! A whole new space series! And that would be awesome! So if you liked the first movie then go ahead and watch this. Not everything has to be perfect for it to be good. And this might not be perfect but its still very enjoyable and i was grabbed through all of the movie. Diddent find it boring at all. So go ahead! Watch this movie!

476,FrankNave,"Action-packed, exhilarating sequel, worthy of the original.",8,3 July 2016,"Anyone who ""thoroughly enjoyed"" the first Independence Day should check out ID4 Resurgence. The advancements in audio and visual special effects have improved so much over the last 20 years that the post-alien invasion world of 'Resurgence' truly appears the way it should in this film. I was impressed by even the simplest technological innovations like people's strong phone and internet connections between Earth and the Moon. The international moon base was also very well put together. I also enjoyed the returning cast of characters in this film that gave the story a sense of continuity that any good sequel needs to have.",Independence Day - Resurgence
477,danhall86,Contender for worst film I've ever seen,3,7 August 2016,"ID4 was a knockout film back in 1996 (I was 10 years old). Yes it was big and dumb, but it also had suspense, humour, a genuine heart and a wonderful music score by David Arnold. It was a B-movie on paper that turned out to be an earnest blockbuster, not just because of its scale and special effects, but because of the cast of relatable characters and a shred of believability.The only aspects Resurgence manages to recapture are the 'scale and special effects' and the 'big and dumb.' Dialogue is cringeworthy, characters are brought back and then disposed of haphazardly, everything feels implausible, it feels rushed like the whole introduction of the movie is missing, acting is questionable, the inferior music is a clichéd pro-American march throughout, global destruction is predictably satisfying, but the story and characterisation was so shallow I didn't care for a fraction of a second. Did I mention the plot is really, really stupid? It feels like a full-on B-Movie this time around, and not in a good way. Imagine if 'The Asylum' made their usual low budget rip off of the original Independence Day - that's almost what this feels like. I'm dreading Roland Emmerich revisiting (and subsequently ruining) the Stargate franchise too.Suicide Squad may not be the greatest success this year, but Will Smith did well to choose that over this.",Independence Day - Resurgence

The first movie in my opinion was well done with great character development and very good CGI. It drew you in to the characters, their lives and interactions. This movie had basically no character development and what little existed failed to establish any connection to the characters and little to no concern for them. The CGI seemed to be CGI for its own sake and not really a part of what was suppose to be taking place. In the end this is one movie it would have been better for the ""bad"" guys to win utterly obliterating the ""good"" guys just there would be no chance of another sequel.

482,mikaelmadsen1981,Spend your money elsewhere,2,30 June 2016,"So. I don't know where to start really so I'll just start from the beginning.This is the same movie as the first one, just bigger and more expensive. It has the alien punch to the face, the dog that get rescued, the top of building group of people and more. And the only part of movie that made me giggle was towards the end, in a school bus when they wipe the windshield. The one liners are none existent or bad at best.About the movie it self.I wanted to leave the theater after 15 minutes. There's nothing there except for a cheesy look back at Bill Pullmans speech from the first movie and some weird explanation how humanity have used the alien technology to apparently change their entire community from weapons to flying cars entire cities and space travel, sure good enough, I guess that could happen. But then they introduced the bromance, two best friends that now hate each other. Then and there you knew that in the end they become friends again and save the world, cliché.The cast from the original movie are just there, they don't add anything to the movie. Will Smiths character have somehow died, you never get to know how, but apparently the worlds best pilot that can fly an alien ship and save the world is dead. The writers didn't care enough to give a good reason or another story (I think Will Smith read the script and and said no on, smart move).*** SPOILER ***Without spoiling the movie to much. OK, here's a big spoiler (The end) and the the part I had a real hard time with. Bill Pullmans character dies for no reason at all. He was suppose to sacrifice himself to save the world, and there was a ""sad"" moment with his daughter and so on but in the end it does nothing. He blows the mother ship to pieces but the queen survives an alien nuclear blast and goes on a rampage because she had a personal shield... That same shield is minutes later taken down by two simple alien fighter ships and killed instantly. So the shield that could handle a photon nuclear blast when one of the biggest stars in the movie sacrifices himself is later taken down by two lousy spaceships.The dialog is cheesy, there's no emotions, a whole bunch of familiar big Hollywood stars that ads nothing to the story...Go spend your money somewhere else, this was 2016 biggest disappointment and someone in Hollywood should get fired for releasing/writing this.",Independence Day - Resurgence

But overall there were just far too many characters who we don't care about, plus a moronic plot. Sure, we go into this sort of movie expecting no brains and big explosions; this took it to a new level in both respects. Huge continuity errors, ridiculous 'science' even a ten-year-old wouldn't buy, clichés like you've never seen before, and some toe-curling dialogue.

This sequel just didn't work as a film in its own right. It is hard to do a good sequel and one that comes 20 years after the original has an uphill task to reach the expectations of those that saw and enjoyed the original.

A lot of people seem to have joined the herd mentality, enjoying a bit of 'Independence Day bashing'. Much like Nickelback bashing, this isn't entirely warranted. Like Nickelback, this isn't the best film but it is one of the better ones. The CGI is superb, truly surpassing its predecessors. The old characters are brought back well. Though some moments proved cringe worthy (I really don't know what they were thinking with the Cheyenne Mountain scene) and this film had the usual expected unhealthy dose of rabid American patriotism, it didn't break it. Rabid American patriotism is now sprinkled with Chinese propaganda (a trend began by Transformers), but oh well. I have to applaud the film for a realistic vision of how humanity would recover from an alien invasion, a touching portrayal of a gay couple, inclusiveness of minorities beyond the usual, and less cardboard than usual action characters. I see people decrying this as the 'worst action film of recent time'. You apparently have not watched London Has Fallen. I honestly think the reason people like London has Fallen and not Independence Day : Resurgence mostly has to do with the lack of minorities in London has Fallen, but that is just me.Cheesy used to be a hallmark of good disaster/action sci-fi. We didn't expect great romances or heartbreaking stories; we watched them for relaxation. To have a laugh, enjoy some hair raising action, the latest in special effects, while that generations heartthrobs escaped risky scenarios. Mediocre acting, with some great performances sprinkled in, was expected, as long as it was tied together with an adventure that felt real and exciting. This film ticks all the boxes!I thoroughly enjoyed watching.",Independence Day - Resurgence
487,moisesalexramirez,"Bigger ships, more explosions, same old story",5,28 June 2016,"For those of us who grew up with the first Independence Day Resurgence in the 90s, we kind of knew what to expect from its sequel: nasty aliens, huge ships, lots of American imagery and some cheesy, yet sometimes funny dialogue. For those that did not grow up with the first movie, I think they kind of expected the same from the trailers.This film is enjoyable, and by enjoyable I mean a popcorn movie with some cool CGI, a simple storyline and some funny moments. By enjoyable I do not mean developed characters, a complex narrative, solid performances, or anything that would really stand out in a film where the premise is an alien invasion as a result of another failed alien invasion. It is filled with clichés and some very predictable moments, but it does steal a smile from you once in a while. Get the picture? The film does have some good points. As with any other Roland Emmerich film, it provides the audiences with a huge sense of scale; I can't remember any recent film where alien ships were this big. The action sequences were good to a degree, though I think they could have invested a little more screen time and different angles in them. The CGI was also decent, as it is expected from a film whose major investment from a technical and artistic standpoint is actually CGI, though some parts did seem a bit artificial in that sense.As for the drawbacks, as already stated, there are so many clichés that it seems this film took those 20 years of hiatus to write every Hollywood-esque moment they could come up with. Some story elements were very predictable for the entirety of the film's running time. Most of the characters made an attempt at becoming a little more than one dimensional beings, but the writing seemed off in its most critical moments, and they lacked the true characterization they required.It is not academy-award material in any way. I wouldn't say it is horrible either. It's just there. I would recommend it for those seeking to have a fun time, not to praise the visual arts.",Independence Day - Resurgence

Most of the original cast returns (save for Will Smith, whose character is killed off in the story). Even Robert Loggia makes a brief welcome appearance in the beginning of the film. It was his last film role.Despite all the returning cast members, the film feels badly edited and rushed into completion. Another major problem is the story doesn't allow the viewer to care about the characters very much (unlike the original which had a ton of likable and appealing characters).Besides the visual effects (including the awesome gigantic alien queen), the only other saving grace of the film is Brent Spiner as Dr. Okun.

After I watched the trailer, my prediction was somewhat true. This film was somewhat enjoyable but it's problems are obvious, a sign of a lazy screenplay. The best scene in this film is when Dylan had a short confrontation with Jake, the action scenes have too much CGI for my taste, it's hard to be wowed when everything looks like a video game, but it was somewhat fun. The main issue with this film was that our two main pilots were not able to make the audience applaud when they finally won, this is because they weren't given the correct screen time and they didn't develop properly. The issues between Jake and Dylan ended with no proper development. A scene where a certain female had died should of been put in the later part of the film to get the proper emotional effect, it was put their hoping we would feel sad, we're smarter than that. A man sees visions but no explanation how. This man could of helped, but he's useless. Their initial Military strategy was clearly flawed, even I saw that and I know nothing about the air force. To sum up, I think this film believed their audience wouldn't care or wont notice the major flaws in this film. We did, we're smarter than you think.

493,marosbts,"We haven´t learned a bit, the aliens haven´t either",1,8 April 2020,"For years I was hopeful that the original Independence day would get a sequel. Now, for years I am regretting that it ever did.Overall, it is a dumb movie, made for dumb people. While this sounds like an insult, it is not. The sheer fact that this film tanked at the box office and earned way less than the original means, that humanity has evolved and requires so much more from movies than what was given to us in this film.The reasons why this film has not lived to its expectation are many. Bad actors, performing poorly is for sure one. But even the best actors would most likely not be able to save the poor script based on which this movie was filmed.One of the things which kill it, is that the sequel does not move a bit further from its original and builds on the same basics. Earth is unaware that a ship the size of the moon is approaching until it is in your backyard. It lands on earth, with the terran defenses unable to make a dent into it, so they try the same stupid tactics of sending squadrons of fighters which are one by one shot down by the alien fighters. Bomber pilots are unable to destroy the mothership, as the nuclear bombs can not be detonated by them but must be triggered from earth. In the middle of all of this a mom with a newborn baby is rescued from a skyscraper while the mom of one of the fighter pilots falls to certain death. (we knew this would happen the moment the camera cut to the scene).Earth is yet again at the brink of total destruction, as aliens dig a hole to the earths core. The only hope left is a heroic pilot and a mad scientist. Yes, yet again.In a unexpected twist (blink blink) the scientist with the help of a friendly alien intelligence comes up with a plan, while the pilot flies around in a stolen alien craft at his will. Obviously, the alien queen, instead of sending her massive armies to destroy the alien intelligence or continuing to drill for the core, leaves the safety of the mother ship and goes on a personal vendetta mission, only to attack a school bus full of kids. With a queen this stupid, its only a matter of time until the heroic pilot kills her after some physics and logic defying moves.Earth is saved, and so is the rest of the brain cells of the viewers.

495,zimmerj47,Worst Sequel Ever ..... and they are planning a 3rd ????,3,25 March 2017,I was looking forward to the release of this movie as I am a big fan of the original. I can see why Will Smith opted out of this project. The writing is confusing with very little character biography about the new characters what happened to the old characters like Jeff Add to dictionary ex wife Connie .....the acting below average and the Special Effects did NOT really taken advantage of today's technology. The movie ending implies there will be yet another sequel. I sure hope not !!!!,Independence Day - Resurgence
496,dougteach,TERRIBLE,2,7 December 2019,"The plot line mistakes in this movie would take 10 pages to type, which is probably longer than the script itself. For starters, the aliens have an enemy that has ALL the keys to defeating them ...... but wait, they were defeating an annihilated by those aliens. Then, the aliens are so powerful that when they send a weapon to protect earthlings, it is shot down and destroyed by said humans. Then, the ONLY thing that survives the crash is the ultimate weapon and Jeff Goldblum's character just happens to realize that it is the ONE piece of wreckage that they have to have. The aliens send down ships that blow up Cheyenne Mountain in a matter of seconds - the most secure place in the United States - but instead of sending those same ships to destroy Area 51, the alien queen decides to personally attack Area 51, instead of staying in her perfectly safe master ship. The alien queen sits a ""trap"" for the humans in the master ship, but instead of it killing the humans, almost all of them survive. We do not know how they survived because their ships were blown up, but they somehow lived! She is able to control all the ships, but the ones the humans are in! Then, the humans in the aliens ships hit their ""warp drives"", but somehow avoid crashing even though they are in the middle of literally thousands of alien ships. Then, instead of protecting the queen which is what they were there to do, they let the two humans in to destroy her. The list goes on and on and on.

I know, it was no cinematic masterpiece, but nonetheless, I saw it 4 times in the theaters. It held a special place in my heart for being very close to a quest-myth I wrote in high school English comp.Then I saw the 5.9(at the time) score on IMDb, and I thought ""No way this movie could be that bad!"". But F@#K THAT - No way this movie can be that good!This movie is SOOOO BADDDDD ..... ""How Bad is it Neo?!?"" ... it's SOOOOO BAD, I started rooting for the aliens about 10-15 minutes in. This demonstrates the complete uselessness of the RT critic rating. This movie has a better rating than BvS?!? Are you F@#$in KIDDING ME!!?!?. Now, BvS, with it's flaws should have been a better movie. But it is ET, Empire Strikes Back, Spiderman 1, and TDK COMBINED compared to this turd. Most of the issues with BvS are about the artistic expression and Snyder's take on the characters. This movie is so blatantly and fundamentally flawed. Remember that old Man vs Aliens turd from back in the day called ""Wing Commander"". This makes that movie seem Oscar-worthy.10 minutes in and i'm like ""Holy f@#$IN HELL - these humans are dumber than in the 1st movie!"" The best acting was coming from the aliens. I was hoping they would wipe out the humans so there couldn't possibly even be a sniff of another sequel. They were super f@#$in dumb, with sh@# actors, led by a sh@# director, and written by LIVING F#$KING BRAIN-DONORS!!! I WAS HOPING ONE OF THOSE LASERS WOULD PUT ME OUT OF MY MISERY.Going into this year, I had such huge hopes for the movies this spring/summer. I thought we'd have one that rivaled 2009 or 2014.

It holds true for most people. Yet, the original movie, even when judged by my 41 years old brain now, without considering the nostalgia factor, and even in all its cheesiness ... still manages to be far far superior from this absolute garbage!This sequel really is a let down of epic proportions, and I felt like I wasted my money. It manages to be what the first movie totally wasn't ...and that can be summed up in one word: BORING.

Sure, the action scenes were frequent. If you are a teenage boy, you'll probably love this flick.My biggest problem with this flick is that you never have a chance to feel the desperation or hopelessness of a planet that is under attack by a superior force or that all hope is lost.

503,dion-perry,An awful film,1,31 October 2016,"This is the worst film that I have watched this year and probably this decade. Having really enjoyed the first Independence Day, I was so disappointed that I almost switched off the film twenty minutes in. The story is set twenty years into the future. Humans have advanced Earth's technology by using the alien technology they now have access to. They now have bases on the moon and other planets in the solar system. Despite the fact that the world is supposedly unified, it is still the USA president in charge of the world. In typical American style, she authorizes an attack on a UFO shooting it down moments before the bad aliens turn up. This leaves those who are still alive from the last attack, along with their children to defend Earth.The film is so convoluted that at any given time I had no clue what was going on or where the story was going. Characters are not introduced or developed leaving the viewer trying to figure out who they are and why we should care about them. The film is also fragmented switching from one scene to the other without any real linkage between them. In addition to this, the film tries to replicate as much from the old film as it can and fails miserably. There are no inspiring speeches, the acting is fifth rate and the film attempts to get by on action and special effects alone. If this is not bad enough, the film tries to include female heroes, but they are still emotionally dependent on men which makes them sexist and pathetic. I'm guessing Will Smith's absence was because he refused to star in such rubbish and I can only commend him for that.I would not recommend the film to anyone. The scary thing about this trash is that not only did it use resources on a film that was worth making, but it promises more to come. If they are stupid enough to make another film, I can only hope it will go straight to DVD. Don't waste your time or money on this one.",Independence Day - Resurgence
504,tylerchesserswim,Good to watch when you're bored and have nothing better to do,5,21 October 2016,"The movie hits a couple of good points. The acting is pretty good, the visual effects are very good, and it fits nicely with what you expect to see in the movie and how you would expect a sequel to the first one. However, it falls short on a lot of things. (1) You don't connect with really any of the characters. When Jasmine (Dylan's mom) dies, its not really that sad. When president Whitmore dies, same thing. Not sad at all. In fact, there's no sad point in the movie. In the 1st movie, when Jimmy (Will Smith's friend) dies, its heart felt and sad. And when the rocket fails to launch in the end due to malfunction, its devastating. But in ID2, there's no emotional connection to any character. (2) Its way too fast. The aliens destroy our defenses and then what feels like 3 scenes later, we figure out how to defeat them. The whole thing just flew by and should have put more focus on certain scenes. (3) There's NO, and I mean ZERO, WOW factor. Alien ship comes to earth, destroys part (not all like the first movie) part of the planet. We blow them all up in the end. Everything you saw in the first movie. Nothing stuck out and was amazing. (4) No build up or climax. No suspense. The whole movie, was predictable and could clearly see what was going to happen. No part made an impact that had you on the edge of your seat and nervous about what was going to happen. So overall, 5 / 10. I would recommend if you're bored and want to see something visually entertaining because you have 2 hours to kill, then sure watch this movie.",Independence Day - Resurgence

507,pablospersonal,"Good, over the top cinema",7,24 June 2016,"Independence Day was one of those movies that everyone seems to have in their collection. Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum brought buddy to the Sci-Fi in the mid 90's. The result was the spectacular, alien invasion movie of the decade.Fast forward 20 years and everything has changed. Will Smith is no longer with us (in the film). Goldblum returns, as well as a myriad of old faces. However this, the second outing, fails to ignite like the first film. Don't get me wrong, the film is good and well worth a watch- but don't be expecting that same magic. The movie has a different tone, all be it a recognizable one. Aliens come to earth, man must ""find a way"" to survive the onslaught and save themselves from near destruction. Nothing to the plot really, that is it! It should be the characters that drive this film. Goldblum reprises his role as Dr. Levinson with his usual dry charm. He is appealing and can really hold his own. However he just doesn't get the right screen time. Goldblum is an interesting actor and one I have never been able to figure out. I have also never worked out what it is that is so likable about the man - yet he is likable and watchable. One of the flaws of this movie is the missing ""buddy"" partnership. It always feels like Goldblum is in need of someone to bounce from. He doesn't really get that support in the film. His presence is a welcomed sight on the big screen though. Chris Hemsworth's brother provides the lovable rogue figure. His character Jake Morrison seems to be made up of existing characters from some of Hollywoods greatest action movies. He is the Maverick, the John McClane, the Martin Riggs of this movie. Again, you don't really get to see his character develop through the film and that is slightly under hand. His character would have been perfect opposite Goldblum. Jessie Usher takes the helm as Will Smiths son. An air force Captain, who looks as though he just graduated high school. He pus in a good performance, but hasn't the character and charisma of his ""father"". He lacks that impact, again possibly due to the poor development of back story and character. There is some fine support from Bill Pullman, Judd Hirsch and Brent Spiner. All three add great viewing and individual performances worthy of merit. The film itself is laden with special effects, of which there are no complaints. They are spectacular! The script is far from dull, however does not capitalize on certain back stories and characters that would have birthed some interesting angles as the story unfolds. At time the movie suffers from claustrophobia, like it is suffocating on its own existence. Again, it is very watchable, but does not flow as well as it could. Most apparent is the films direction. It was left with a wide open door to a sequel.The film is over the top, brash at times and seemingly thoughtless. What made the first movie great was the belief that an invasion could actually happen (for the two hours you are sat watching it). This movie does not! Man has integrated its own technology with alien technology and instantly that takes away from the magic of the atmosphere. I wanted to see man, overcome all the odds and defeat aliens with a tooth brush and a clothes peg. All this being said, the movie has some good one liners. Character interaction is good, when it happens. The effects are phenomenal. It is good to see a stellar cast and the homage to other movies within Hollywood history makes you smile. Would I rate this film - yes. It is worth a watch. Two hours of substance that will give you enough to make you happy. Although you may come away feeling a tad frustrated. Cheese rating is 10.",Independence Day - Resurgence
508,geneguerrero,It Was the Lady President's Fault,7,30 June 2016,"It was the lady President's fault Earth got attacked again. Instead of listening to David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), the one figured out how to take down the aliens in ID4, she folded under pressure from other World leaders to make the first strike at an incoming alien spaceship entering the Earth's atmosphere who gave no indication yet of an attack. This makes you wonder if the aliens were coming for humanity's help with an intergalactic war about to happen in the universe which you'll see at the end makes sense.Anywho, despite no Will Smith and an incredible $225 million dollar budget, Independence Day: Resurgence delivered on great special effects and popcorn-blockbuster action thrills. The acting wasn't as bad as some people are making it out to be. The story did leave some unanswered questions though. For example, the returning Dr. Brakish Okun (Brent Spiner) wakes up from a coma when he actually seemed pretty dead at the end of ID4. Not much depth there, he just wakes up after 20 years and puts himself in the game. And I might've missed it but I don't remember them explaining how Captain Hiller (Will Smith) died. Also back is President Whitmore (Bill Pullman) who now walks with a cane ala' The Dark Knight Rises. I think the writers were wanting to reintroduce the franchise to a newer audience but failed due to the lack of depth in characters. And of course, they waited 20years for a sequel where the audience now expects everything to have a scientific explanation which it did not for some parts. Hence, the plot holes.Independence Day: Resurgence was not a perfect movie but it is a summer movie. And those movies usually aims to show their audience a good time no matter how incredible or ridiculous the circumstances may be. If you're a fan of Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin's style of destructive, CGI action thrill scenes then you won't be disappointed.",Independence Day - Resurgence

Resurgence only serves to re-inforce that propaganda and remind us all that the Americans are still there saving our asses.The vast majority of scenes are just re-runs of the original with a bit of added modern day sauce to spice up the visuals. It steals so many scenes and ideas from other movies to make up for the complete lack of ideas that the production team had. The acting is wooden at best and begs the question why any of the actors took part for any reason other than to inflate their bank accounts. Brent Spiner is just awful and Data is now meaningless to me. Pullman, the ex president, appears to have been pulled off the streets and out of the gutter. Just the sort of place you'd expect to find the ex president and you can see the dollar signs racking up behind Golblum's inane, never changing expression.Do not waste of any your precious time on this ball of rock going to see or buying the DVD of this utterly dire crock.

This movie needs to bomb, it needs to crash, it must be the point where the madness of the vapid blockbuster ends. Watch again any episode of ""Game of Thrones"" instead.

516,StAdrian,Rock bottom...,1,27 July 2016,"Alongside Battleship and Godzilla, this movie is among the worst SF movies of all times. Some of the actors can actually act, but not even they can save anything because of the unbelievably bad script. You have to see it, to believe it, true, but it is not worth your time.First, it is very hard for the audience to emotionally relate to any character or event. It is so blatantly clear that actors speak for the audience to ""get it"" that their dialogue has no meaning other than to document facts we have not seen. And even so, the interesting questions you might have will remain unanswered. The CGI is OK, but its use completely overshadows any meaningful emotion the viewer might have in relation to the events on the screen. It's simply too much and the attachment is impossible.Secondly, the script is bad. I mean really bad. I know I said this before, but there really are no words to describe it. You know it when complete sections of dialogue are lifted from Independence Day (1996) and paced in this one. As they don't fit the characters anymore - or they completely mess up any evolution that might have taken place meanwhile - the ""magic"" is ruined.Simply stay home, choose another movie, watch Independence Day (1996) again Anything but this!P.S. Watching it I was constantly reminded of low budget movies from the 50's and 60's. Why? Because every cliché imaginable about aliens or relationships is featured in this film.",Independence Day - Resurgence
517,dsphipps100,Take Out the Effects and Not Much Else Left,5,26 June 2016,"Just saw Independence Day Resurgence, and well, I'm glad I saw it in IMAX, because at home on a TV or computer screen, it's sure to be a disappointment.You take away the effects, and you have an underdeveloped overall concept with badly executed pacing, too many scenes that are clearly ""playing to the gallery"", and a fair amount of dialogue that should have been cut or just plain never written.The original ID4 (1996) has an IMDb rating of 6.9, which is probably about right, so if that's the case, then ID4R (2016) should probably be about a 5.8 - which, as it so happens, is precisely what it (currently) is.I liked the overall concept, that 1996's aliens got off a distress signal that brought reinforcements, but from that point on, teenagers seems to have taken over the production.Earth of 2016 has had little trouble reverse engineering and assimilating the aliens' advanced technology (which we destroyed in 1996, don't forget), which seems highly unlikely. What are the odds that 19th Century people could see some PC computers in action, get their hands on a few destroyed iPads, and within only 20 years have the whole planet covered in mobile tech? Same problem applies here.Then there's the obligatory, misguided, and badly written effort to show us what happened to all the main characters from ID4 and to bring them into this new storyline. Maybe a little paring down on this aspect might have helped streamline the bloated script somewhat. (It's not as if the world wouldn't have survived without Julian Levinson driving a school bus through the desert, after all.) Then there's the aliens themselves. Their appearance was successfully more menacing thanks to CGI, but there was very little time/effort spent on developing their plan and/or hierarchy, which I suppose is because the producers figure ID4 already covered that.But then there's the alien ""queen"" thing. ****SIGH**** (even referred to as ""she"" in the dialogue, even though there's no hint whatsoever of her having any sort of reproductive role, a la a queen bee or the alien queen of 1986's ""Aliens"" (for which it was actually an original concept for that movie). Labeling an alien as ""queen"" just so you can make it the ""boss"" of the other aliens, but more importantly, also give it gargantuan, monstrous size is a worn-out, tired concept that needs to be just simply forgotten by all monster/alien movie writers, OK? It no longer has the impact that you think it's going to have, so just don't do it.Personally, if it had been me writing for ID4R, I would have presented Earth as badly divided (instead of united in one anti-alien, feel-the-love, happy Terran family) while they recover unevenly from 1996's catastrophe (clearly, developed nations like the EU and the USA would recover more quickly than third-world nations, and there would undoubtedly be a great deal of bitterness over that), plus the world should have been shown as struggling with the alien technology, desperately trying to figure it out, with the various nations where ships crashed keeping what they learn as closely guarded secrets from each other, leading to even more division.They would certainly not have recovered to the point where we would have a massive forward base on the moon......oh, and then, there's the idea of the USA having a woman president. If that's not the producers having wishful thinking about Hillary Clinton, then I don't know what is - just one more thing cheapening the movie, please leave your politics at home producers!!......and then there would certainly NOT be a quick fix like just-kill-the-alien-queen to make the whole re-invasion quickly and conveniently fall apart.I could go on and on about other things that should have been different about the script, but you get the point.1996's ID4's strongest point was that it took a world which, in 1996 terms, was realistic, it was believable, and it was similar to what we were all living with around us. Then, into that environment, it injected something that, while clearly fantastical (an alien invasion), was still somewhat based in ""reality"", if one keeps in mind all the UFO controversies around the world and stories of alien kidnapping (not saying anything one way or the other about how credible those stories are). So ID4 at least had SOME basis in reality to build from. That, plus a well-paced story (with the invasion being presented in the very first scene, even before we see any humans!) and a non-bloated dialogue all combined to make a true blockbuster movie that audiences could relate to.This movie has no such basis in reality to begin from, and then the story is not well-paced (it takes half the movie just to get going!), plus the dialogue will have the audience conscious of the movie's writers instead of the characters they're watching on the screen.The ONLY thing that was truly well-done in this movie is the effects and the sound. So you better see it in IMAX 3D, because on your flatscreen at home, even the effects will be a flop.",Independence Day - Resurgence

519,helge-fauskanger,I don't have enough suspension of disbelief for this,3,5 July 2016,"Back in '96, my 25-year-old self took the original ID4 for what it was. For all its semi-intentional goofiness, it had a certain silly charm. At least I could sit there with a mocking smile as the rah-rah American jingoism was on full display.But this one? Seriously, large parts of it felt like the kind of fan fiction a 13-year-old might come up with, if he had to write a script for an ID4 sequel.Sure, if everything you need to be happy is a gazillion tons of eye candy, this movie delivers. But somewhere along the way, it dawned on me: I simply don't have enough suspension of disbelief to be able to enjoy this.I mean, there is SO much in this ""plot"" that hardly makes any sense at all. It is just dumb. It is a bloated mess. Even the goofy 1996 original seems starkly realistic after watching this. And that ought to tell you something! (Massive ""spoilers"" ahead  duh!) Okay, so the world united after the War of 1996. After harvesting alien technology we built a planetary defense. Well and good so far. We are celebrating the 20-year-anniversary of the original victory against the aliens   and then a strange, globe-shaped craft appears near a human base on the moon. It is shot down. And then  and then   the celebrations just go on! Yay us! The American president announces the event as if it was nothing much to worry about.HELLO?!!! Do alien intruders appear just about every fortnight and are casually shot down without further incident, or what? REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED BACK IN '96, FOLKS? If the movie took its own premise even remotely seriously, the first appearance of an alien craft — ANY alien craft — in twenty years ought to instantly trigger a global red alert and a mass exodus from all major cities. All celebrations would be canceled, and the global defenses would go to the equivalent of Defcon 1. The people in the movie just seem to shrug off the little incident on the moon.Eventually it turns out that the ship we took out represented a Good Alien species. They had come to warn us that the Bad Aliens are on their way back. But despite being supposedly super-intelligent, the Good Aliens never had the foresight to send some kind of introductory message to indicate their peaceful intentions. They just turned up, rather abruptly, over a military base on the moon. Did it never occur to the oh-so-intelligent Good Aliens that we just might be a little trigger happy after the events of '96? Sure enough, the baddies appear only minutes later, and this time they have a ship so big that it  wait for it  COVERS THE ENTIRE Atlantic OCEAN! (Strategic mistake #1 on the part of the aliens: They should have set their ship down smack on top of the US instead, crushing those pesky Americans into the ground. They are the ones that always foil the plans of the invaders, remember?) What do the aliens want? It turns out that their plan is to drill down to the earth's core and extract metals from it! Apparently that was their goal back in 1996 as well (we learn that one ship landed in Africa and started drilling away, but the process was interrupted when the Mothership was destroyed).And so the credibility of the plot collapses completely. In the original movie, it was suggested that the aliens wanted to exploit all sorts of earthly natural resources. But if they just want to extract metals from the planetary core, there must be millions of uninhabited planets all over the cosmos that can give them what they need without them having to enter into any military confrontation whatsoever. Heck, even in our solar system they could just go and mine Venus instead! We are treated to some kind of attempted ""suspenseful countdown"" as the aliens are penetrating the outer crust. Supposedly everything will go to hell in a handbasket once they reach the molten core, and during the ""climax"" we are incessantly informed that an ever-dwindling number of minutes are left before the core is penetrated. Again I have to say, HELLO?! Does anyone think the entire planet will explode like a balloon just because the aliens reach the molten core? Incidentally, how do we know how many minutes are left before the core is reached? We-e-elllll, you see, there was a ship full of treasure hunters out there in the ocean, and they had just located a shipwreck full of gold  but then the aliens came, and the treasure hunters are suddenly hired by the American government (for $ 100,000,000, no less) to keep an eye on how Bad ET is progressing. And of course, a ship originally equipped to look for sunken treasure will have ALL the instruments needed to perform detailed scans of the earth's crust down to a depth of many miles.Seriously! This is the kind of garbage the lazy scriptwriters are unabashedly asking us to swallow.And so, you wonder, what staggering feat of narrative originality will these same writers bring us as the climax approaches? Well, uhm, there is actually  AN ALIEN QUEEN! And since Ellen Ripley won't swoop in to save the day, and James Cameron still hasn't had the time to sue, it is time for ex-President Whitmore to make the  gasp  ultimate sacrifice.I barely raised an eyebrow. At this point, the ""realism"" of the movie was at about the same level as a Tom & Jerry cartoon anyway. Sizewise, the Alien Queen is such a physical impossibility that she makes any version of King Kong look like an Attenborough documentary on primates.I just didn't care anymore. Nor should you.",Independence Day - Resurgence

I don't know what is wrong with these people, all these stuck up fancy ass critics and their snob reviews - they should stick to watching The Russia House, Elizabethtown, The Good Shepard, Seabiscuit and other cool action packed films Zzzzzzz hahahaha!!! I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!! I think its just as good as the first one!! The CGI is amazing! Its exciting! It has humor! It has some of the coolest scifi tech I have seen in ages! - Totally worth watching!!!! I could have done without the religious stuff and the queen bug chasing a school bus hehehe, but other than that I TOTALLY LOOOOOOVED IT!!! With the end it definitely opens up for one more Independence Day movie where I hope Earth have even cooler tech and weapons, and where they attack the bad Aliens together with other races. I will be at the premiere for that one for sure!! From this Tech/CGI/SciFi freak... GREAT MOVIE!!!!",Independence Day - Resurgence

Unfortunately this creates ""blue balls"" and when friendly aliens send a convoy America shoots its military load prematurely, destroying these allies. Then the real enemy arrives: A spaceship half the size of the planet! This movie was created by Hollywood, so of course this ship attacks only famous landmarks around the globe (The London Eye, The London Bridge and The Eiffel Tower) as these are the only places Hollywood has heard of. This angers America , as bullying foreign nations is their responsibility, so they send both of their presidential candidates to battle this spaceship. Donald Trump's hair manages to defeat half of the alien forces, but is eventually defeated. So as a last resort Hillary Clinton is sent up to the mother-ship.

I should have stayed at home playing with my dog.First of all, I completely understand why Will Smith did not want any part on this movie. His manager probably read the script and instantly knew it was going to be bad and cheesy. I was actually rooting for the aliens to kill everyone as soon as possible so the movie could be done. If that had happened, this movie would have gained a 10 star rating on IMDb. I think they tried to ""replace"" Will's part with Liam H. We all remember Will being the funny one during the first movie. He was hilarious!! They tried to do the same thing with Liam, however, his jokes were so ridiculously bad and they were trying too hard. Liam has no charisma whatsoever. I think the big mother alien had more charisma than Liam Hemsworth. What kind of saved the movie a little bit was the older characters and the big Nigerian guy. That's it. Everybody else had no personality, there were not entertaining, and they kind of make you cheer for the of the world. With the first movie, I felt so empowered. This one, not that much. The writing on this movie and plot were really, really bad. I mean, seemed like a 10 year old wrote it. I wish I could have my money & time back.",Independence Day - Resurgence
526,poopfock,Have you seen ID4 (1996)? Then you've seen 90% of ID2.,5,29 June 2016,"This movie is basically the exact same film as the original except lacking all of the heart.ID2 just basically repeats the entire first film with minor twists: We have alien tech infused into our jets and stuff, and the aliens bring an insanely bigger ship with a bigger queen driving it. That's really the only difference except without spark or even meaning to any of the subplots. Basically, everyone returns to fulfill the same roles they did in the original, but all of the subplots do nothing for the story and none of the relationships are earned. It's almost a straight repeat of the first but it goes bigger (too big) to raise the stakes, while keeping basically the exact same plot. So rather than just an invasion, now the aliens want to siphon the planet core...because that's not a plot anyone has ever used before (sarcasm).It has almost the same subplots and sub-characters but not fleshed out at all, and the aliens basically do the same things as before and are defeated in almost the exact same way. The big difference is that instead of getting a hold of an alien ship to sneak into the big ship and blow it up, they have a McGuffin (a rather stupid one IMO) that they use to get inside the ship and blow it up. It's literally the same film without the charisma and bloated with CGI destruction. It never takes any time to establish relationships with the characters, or ground anything. You get maybe 10 minutes with a couple of the characters and then it goes right into the invasion. Where the original was big dumb fun, this is the brainless disaster porn version. Have you seen the movie 2012 (also by Roland Emmerich)? It's a lot like that actually. Also, this movie doesn't have an ending; the McGuffin is the direct lead into ID3, and it just ends on a stupid cliffhanger for a 3rd film that sounds dumb.The film is watchable, however, because it is pretty much just a straight rehash of the original but not as good and it just goes too big.",Independence Day - Resurgence
527,sneakygloworm,Messy and Dull...,2,2 August 2016,"I've always considered devlin and emmerich to be like uwe boll with a large budget. I wish Hollywood had a retraining program for directors who lose track of basic 101 film making. For instance, in a film of this nature, the first minute or so should set up the threat and then the next 50 or so minutes should establish characters and a main character and the ever looming sense of doom or disaster. The original managed it, jaws did it, earthquake, towering inferno, poseidon adventure, etc. Not so here. After the credits, there is maybe a minute of character establishment then BANG straight into the action....non stop till the end!Then, you need characters. People you can identify with. Again, nope. No one. They are all strangers to the audience. We either don't like them or can't identify with them because they are 2 dimensional.You need a story. Something to draw you in and make you care about what is happening. Not here though. It is done on the fly. Literally told to us seconds before the event unfolds. No build, no tension. Consistency. Independence Day setup a believable threat in the alien tech. Huge ships with fighter craft that had shields. 20 years later, humans have reverse engineered the alien tech. We have hover vehicles, new ground weapons similar to the aliens primary weapon. We have new shiny alien tech cities. We always knew the aliens would return. But what was the one thing we forgot to defend ourselves with? The one thing that the aliens used throughout ID which made the almost invulnerable but we forgot (until it was convenient to the plot)? SHIELDS!!!! The one piece of tech that any normal person would've thought would make a great addition to the safety of mankind and probably the very first thing to be developed. No more car crashes, no more shootings, etc. No, we forgot to use them!!! So with all the new tech that we've developed since 1996, we get our arses handed to us on a plate within 4 minutes of the movie starting because of an oversight! Which renders the whole tech development plot completely pointless. If trusty f15's and nuclear weapons were used instead, it would've made absolutely no difference to the plot except for a scene near the end where, all of a sudden, we have a shield!!!! Lucky us!!Finally, the editing is abysmal. No scene lasts longer than 4 or 5 seconds so you can never really take in the full scale of what is on screen. It feels like a series of fast moving flashy images. Intelligent dialogue is also non existent, all the veteran actors simply do what needs to be done and Jeff goldblum just seems bored by it all. The plot is cliché ridden using unbelievable and lazy ways to advance the story. The 2 hour film is so constantly in your face, that you become numb to it and, ultimately, bored.This is just another nail in the coffin of modern filmaking. Not one but two total disasters this year. This and ghostbusters! It must be a new record. Two potential blockbusters that are utter stinkers because of lazy direction, lazy screenplay and greedy corporations. I hope these two films sink without trace. God forbid they make any more.",Independence Day - Resurgence
528,arsty,Not bad but just feel missed something,6,24 June 2016,"Maybe I expect too much. Compared with ID4, I couldn't feel much tension and passion during 2 hours. Be honest, it's still a good popcorn movie, but it just can't make you really high!Also as a Taiwanese, I strongly felt Hollywood really want to make money by kissing Chinese ass. It's not a bad thing. But even my Chinese friends think the way they used in this film is just too obviously and rough.Angelababy is a famous young actress in China but her acting can't support the character.In addition, they also put some sub story line like they did in ID4. However, all story lines combined in a great way in ID4. This time you may feel some story line is not necessary.I would only recommend people who expect a normal popcorn movie to go to theater. If you are looking for a bible class movie, you may think about it.PS.: I watched ID4 again after couple days, and I realized 20 years ago, our standard is much lower than present day.

Why try to 1-up that speech more than once in this one film?!Aside from the horrible writing, at least Goldblum and diet Hemsworth are OK as far as acting goes, and the narrative actually isn't bad. It's a shame the story gets overtaken by the awful lines and their delivery from the other 99% of the cast.

The one monster inside after prox 1 hour and 18 minute with 3 heads obviously looks like a hydra, other aliens obviously looks like old alien movies.

Will Smith not being in the movie didn't really bother me that much. The sons and daughters of everyone from the first movie are all grown up now and are all fighter pilots. President Whitmore, David Levinson, Dr Okun and General Grey are all around and treated like royalty for their actions during ""the War of 1996"". The sons and daughters are all grown up and all fighter pilots. You know who was missing? Russell Casse's family. You know. That guy who gleefully screamed, ""Hello boys.. I'm baaaack"" and flew his plane straight into the weapons port of the ship which destroys the whole thing. He found the zero- day for that thing and sacrificed himself destroying the ship. Where are his kids? Frankly, I might have cared more for the Jake Morrison character if he was Casse's older son. Or youngest son. In fact, when I heard about the character, I thought he might be Russell Casse's son. I think that would have brought more meaning to all the lead roles. Oh well. Then there are the inconsistencies. The alien destroyer that landed somewhere in Africa was drilling into the ground. How is it that no one knew about it for 20 years? I'll tell you how. BECAUSE IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. Then there are the visions. Russell Casse claims to have been abducted by aliens, presumably by the same ones that scouted our planet in the 40s and invaded it in 1996. Why didn't he have visions like President Whitmore, Umbutu and many others? The mother-ship in this movie. The colossal saucer that's 3000 miles in diameter and has it's own gravity. It destroyed so much of the planet while landing but in the end, after the Queen was killed, it started to take off again without causing any new damage. Whaaaat???!!!And why did the good guy aliens have to come in such a menacing way, sucking up moons and earth bases. Anyone would have shot at them. It wasn't all bad though. I enjoyed the fun lines from David Levinson a lot... ""They do like to get the landmarks""... LOL. And Julius Levinson's book - ""How I saved the World"". :DAll the problems aside, I would watch the movie again. It had everything I enjoy- aliens, mother-ship, giant alien Queen (don't know why she had to be Godzilla-sized), shiny jets and space tugs and moon bases.. Sweet!!!

Compared to star wars recent movie, I liked that things happen on earth to give it all scale. blowing up a solar system is a yawn but destroy a city has more visceral effect as the first movie proved.Adding the second alien was great. All of the returning characters were good. Spinner was a hoot. Goldblum still has it. The old president was good. The younger cast are good, but they are less differentiated than the older cast members. They blur when the action gets going. Sure the tropes were fast and heavy. I'll let Cineramasins deal with that. The coincidental survival and meeting of all the old characters and essential new ones really got tiresome. I would have a appreciated some reason they all got together, like being called up by the president because they had fought them before. There must have been over a doze 1 in a million chance meetings and survivals. The space craft was crazy big, and they tried but failed to impress on us that it was the size of the Atlantic. Nor was that necessary. 10 times the previous movie size would have done just fine. It's Scifi, of course, so the impossibility by today's science shouldn't bug me. But it does pop me out of the move for a movement when it's absurdly over the top. Try to adopt a ""what if it were possible"" attitude. The travel and communications to the moon should have had a lantern hung on it. It was way too fast. Now, of course, the scifi explanation is the alien tech allowed this. But someone needed to warn us as or before it happens, again so we would not pop out of the movie mentally. The queen looked a little too much like Alien.

Yes, It was this bad. It has none of the power and thrill that accompanied the first movie. I mean, no one can replace Will Smith. I'm not surprised he didn't agree to do this movie. All the new characters are bad and un-relatable (what's with Liam Hemsworth looking exactly like Spanish football player Gerard Pique?) In the first movie you could sympathize with the President (Bill Pullman) and the Fighters (remember Randy Quaid?) but in this one I didn't really care who lived and who died. The story and dialogue were so bad and the jokes were cheesy.The female characters were all bad .. Vivica A. Fox barely had a few lines, Sela Ward had nothing of the qualities of a President, and Maika Monroe was not convincing as a strong character. She was just like a love interest in a teen flick, crying and whining the whole time. The Alien ""Queen"" was laughable. All that superior technology and she didn't have one decent weapon, while the far less human fighters (in power and numbers) were just blasting away everything that came their way.Some characters had no real purpose in the movie like Judd Hirsch as David's dad , Rain Lao (I think they included her just to appeal to Chinese audience) and Dr. Isaacs.The white sphere reminded me of ""The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy"" (that one had more realistic Sci-fi btw.) Bill Pullman and Jeff Goldblum showed nothing of their old selves (all I could notice is that they got much older .. as did I.)Some CGI were good, but then again not that great.In the end I have one question : (Who drives a bus like that?)I don't think I want to watch a 3rd installment which I doubt they'll even do it after this disaster.",Independence Day - Resurgence

It all felt far too familiar, like every other alien invasion, America- centric apocalypse movie that's ever existed, with ridiculous dialogue between characters, unbearable American patriotism and situations so unbelievable; they had my eyes hurting from how far they'd rolled to the back of my head.This movie was just a load of cringe-worthy one liners, implausible situations and clichés crammed into a 2 hour movie. Unless you like occasional impressive special effects and don't mind a flat story with no charm, don't bother going to see this one.

550,bradyhenson,It needs work,6,1 February 2020,It needs to build up to a great franchise not make it worse the special effects were good even the casting too but the plot is weak even the script is cheesy the movie had some flaws to begin with even it try to be a franchise after the cliffhanger ending it try to be like Star Wars it perspective things about but the main thing is fix it right,Independence Day - Resurgence
551,carassured,A Top-of-the-Tree Alien Invasion Film.,10,21 July 2016,"I thought this was an excellent film.I accept that some people don't rate it but, as Joey Tribbiani would say, ""I don't know what's not to like"": excellent visual effects, check; lots of aliens who are three times the height of a human, check; one alien the size of Godzilla, check; a three-thousand mile diameter space ship, check; another, smaller detachable spaceship built into top of the main one, check; and nuclear bombs, energy weapons, force fields, shields and explosions, check.I must say, the film was unremarkable at first. It started off OK. The plot being that - after the defeat of the aliens, twenty years ago - alien technology is now incorporated into Earth technology. Having not seen any trailers, this was unexpected, but seemed like a pretty good way to begin. There wasn't anything particularly special early on, although it looked well directed. Then the film actually begins. Earth attacks an unidentified alien spaceship. It was at this point it became clear this is one of the best sci-fi films I have seen in a long time.The action just kept coming. The effects and the alien technology were superb. Just what I would expect from an expensive Hollywood sci-fi, alien shoot-'em-up. It is certainly not a taxing movie to watch, but by eliminating the need for intellectual engagement, one can better concentrate on the important stuff, serious spaceship action. By way of illustration, the resolution is not only the same as both the earliest and the most recent Star Wars films, but also the original Independence Day.Yes, there are a few plot holes and a few blunders in science. The film is formulaic to a fair extent, but you get that with most big- budget sci-fi films. It is cheesy in some places, even schmaltzy. Downright ridiculous in others. For plausibility, it is somewhere between the Martian and X-Men. I.E., not very plausible at all. For instance, a school bus full of kids ends up in the scene where the final battle is played out. Quite ludicrous. However, those who are overly critical may like to consider, just for a second, that they were once kids as well. The film has to have something of a wide appeal, in order to fund the lavishness of the production.For those who want real, gritty sci-fi, maybe this doesn't pass muster. Even so, the majority of commenters who criticise the film in this regard do not actually write the film off. Rather, they accept the film's other fine points, of which there are many.For my money, and I apologise if this appears a little glib, if you want science fact, watch a good science documentary. Better still, read a good science book.This is one of the best alien films of the decade.",Independence Day - Resurgence
552,slhma,Glad I watched it,7,5 July 2016,"I.D.The Resurgence is a lot of fun.I was happy to see so many original characters back! Like the original,this is meant to be a summer blockbuster.If you want poetry,watch something else.If you want more action,grandiose ""we are the champions"" type rhetoric and some good humor thrown in,this is your movie.Will' Smith's characters son does a great job,as do all the actors.Its to be expected from these big name actors. I would have liked it to be a little longer,a few more sentimental moments between Goldblum's character and his dad,between Pullman's character(the former president) and his daughter,and Will Smith's son and his mother(from the original movie.)I wonder/hope they just cut those scenes out and they are in the director's cut? This is the kind of fun movie you can watch again...every year...around this time and will enjoy it all over again.Great escapism and ca't go wrong with the notion of global unity...something we sorely need in reality.",Independence Day - Resurgence

The good thing of this movie is huge improvement of the CGI effect...Sound effect is good. Graphic is good too. It is not easy to make this sequel i believe. So let's enjoy it and appreciate it.

554,HospehTehGrate,Butchered.,2,1 July 2016,"Went to watch this movie with low expectations, and it failed to deliver. I just wanted to be mildly entertained! I almost walked out a few times. The best part of the movie was when it ended.My girlfriend fell asleep twice, and ""almost cried from happiness"" when it ended.If you're expecting a slightly worse version of the first part, don't watch this... They use the same characters and visual ideas, but that's about it. If members of the original cast weren't in the movie, I would consider this an unlicensed spin-off.Other than Jeff Goldblum, Judd Hirsch and Brent Spinner, there was no fun in this movie.I enjoyed maybe 15 to 20 minutes out of the 2 hours, mainly due to nostalgia. The biggest crowd reaction was from a butt joke.(Really people?) Worst movie I've watched this decade, easily.*****Spoiler(kinda)***** The movie even admits to its own failure. In the original, Will Smith punches an alien and knocks it out, then delivers the line, ""Now that's what I call a close encounter."" In the sequel, Liam Hemsworth punches an alien and the alien just gets mad, and he admits he ""Should of just kept running"".Touche, Independence Day: Resurgence, Touche!",Independence Day - Resurgence
555,johnrridge,What a waste,3,9 April 2017,"Unbelievable is the only word to describe this...and not in a good way. They've had 20 years to resurrect the Independence Day franchise and this is the best they could do? The movie was poorly written, lacked any depth in the characters, lacked any cohesive flow and just flat out sucked. A group of 7th graders could have written a better sequel. There were so many predictable moments and throw backs to the original it was almost embarrassing. Seriously, anyone that didn't' see the alien grabbing the president and slamming him against the glass must have been snoozing or on their phone. Poor poor remake. Whomever wrote this story has no business working in Hollywood.",Independence Day - Resurgence

The only thing I remember about the movie was that I was in a bad mood after I watched it, that and I had the worst baked beans of my life while watching it, so that might have been a contributing factor.",Independence Day - Resurgence
557,jpmarmaro-2,"Nowhere as bad as most reviewers here are claiming-- indeed, good for the genre",8,1 November 2019,"Come on! No one sitting down to INDEPENDENCE DAY: RESURGENCE could be expecting CITIZEN KANE, THE GODFATHER, or 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, or even FORBIDDEN PLANET or CURSE OF THE DEMON. One should expect-- more of the same. And that is essentially what one gets, though overall I think it a better film than the original. The original had, besides killer special effects, the great suspense of the buildup to the alien attack. Sadly, much of the character-driven scenes ranged from the forgettable to the lamentable; but then, to expect more from such a film is like drinking a glass of ginger ale and expecting Dom Perignon. This film does have a few annoying aspects, such as the reverberation of the squirm-inducing speech of the President in the original, and Judd Hirsch's ""Julius Levenson"" character is as irritating as ever (although that may indeed be because he's MEANT to be irritating). But, apart from some such long scenes near the beginning, mostly to establish the new or newly-grownup characters, such scenes here seem less intrusive. And while it lacks the asset of the long, tense buildup to the attack that the original has, well, after the alien attacks the rest of the original seemed long and anticlimactic. This film is structured better, and actually climaxes near the end. And though the ""disaster porn"" sequences of destruction could have been longer, they were inventive and very well done. Also I must mention how much I liked their making Doctors. Okun (Brent Spiner) and Isaacs (John Storey), who in the original seemed to be only friends and coworkers, lovers (or more properly, life-partners) -- and so sweetly, too. That Dr Isaacs visited and talked to a comatose Dr Okun every day for two decades was a devotion few but the most devoted couples, straight or gay, would ever evince; it was only on second viewing I noticed that, just before the attack on the isolation chamber which would kill Dr Isaacs, almost instinctively and without even looking, they hold hands-- a tender gesture amid the violence and confusion. (Unlike so many gay relationships shown in film today, theirs seemed gentle and natural and not centered on wantonness.) Anyway, I found this film was, overall, more enjoyable than the original. It's hardly a classic, of course... but for its genre, it's quite good enough, and certainly not the disaster some reviewers are dismissing it as.",Independence Day - Resurgence
558,ReplicaSoldier813,GREAT FILM,8,24 April 2020,"I remember Independence Day (1996) with great nostalgia when my father played it for the first time in the VHS. It truly let a great impression in my young mind (I was 6 years old then), and even today (23 years later), I am still captivated by such experience.Roland Emmerich and his talented team made a blockbuster success, not only in terms of moral and cultural enrichment, but in the fields of innovation. These ingenious technical solutions (practical effects, pyrotechnics, scale models, specific landscapes...) played an important role when applied to solve the many unexpected drawbacks to make this particular story a reality. Especially the organic alien designs by Patrick Tatopoulos, and the massive scale of the global situations. The final result is a contemporary Epic depicting cataclysmic events, the clash of two worlds, where our Heroes (hard working people from the society) defend their right to live at the face of the reckoning day. Legendary!Since then, the idea for a sequel regarding this franchise never came to fruition in my mind. The original felt like a standalone film! Nevertheless, when I heard 20 years later about the factual project, I got excited. Even more when the first trailer was released, and once again we hear in the background that memorable speech from Mister President Thomas Whitmore calling a new generation to serve in honor and duty.Unfortunately, ID4-R did not top the shadow of its predecessor. Basically, the main problem was the formula. The new addition to the franchise should have focus completely on tragedy. A theme opposed to The War of 1996, where there was hope and human victory at the end. Independence Day - Resurgence (2016) could have been a unique piece, unforgettable while reaching new grounds. This would have been accomplished by following the Super Bowl TV Commercial trailer spirit. If the aliens were going to make a second coming to mother Earth, the creators should have had the task of presenting them surrounded by heavy feelings of inescapable damnation (existential threat for the human civilization), while implementing an apocalyptical ending (and yet, behind the fumes of ashes: we could have found a little flower of hope); this with the purpose of engaging the audience for the third installment (which till date is not going to happen due to its box office failure).Therefore, finding myself as a huge hardcore fanatic, I decided to fix the sequel into something closer to my vision. By taking out all the ridiculous paraphernalia, I gave a more grounded essence to my fan edition. Finally, I found peace and plenitude in my quest. I only hope everyone enjoy it as much as I do because I did it for love!

559,rander3127,"Well, maybe the 3rd one will be better?",5,18 July 2016,"Remember the movie, ""Outbreak?"" Donald Sutherland plays a crazy, power-mad general bent on preventing anyone from compromising his viral weapon. In one scene he says:Sutherland: ""You kiss a-- with the best of them, Briggs."" In reference to a colonel kissing his general's ass.This is how this movie treats the Chinese. Cloying a---kissing. Disgusting a---kissing. Abject a---kissing. Hollywood playing serf to their new Asian masters. But there's more to it. The Chinese get high-ranking jobs (and low screen time) so Hollywood big-pictures has begun to APE Hollywood TV with minorities!! Don't want to alienate a dwindling but still substantial white audience. But in reality, the DAY the Americans allow the Chinese to colonize and dominate the moon instead of them, well, the empire is doomed. Pandering to the Africans as well, the ""wise"" Africans have a ""connection"" with the aliens that the poor, dumb white man doesn't have. Goldblum flatters and a---kisses the Africans. I guess that's now Hollywood perceived diplomacy works? The acting from most of the cast is terrible, like script-reading. There is none of the sense of discovery, of slow-burn like the original (at least in the beginning) had. It comes off as tiring as one of those Tom Hank's religious ""thrillers."" But with worse acting. Meanwhile, the Chinese ""leader"" of the Moon seems to be able to be in the right place, at the right time, all the time. He's walking quantum physics! Always chastising the white man. I was happy to see his imperious self roasted early on. But his kid survives. She's a fighter pilot. Will Smith's (may his character rest in peace) character's kid gets ""leadership"" of the squadron instead of whitey Hemsworth, who is reckless and doing his most lack-luster Tom Cruise in ""Top Gun"" impersonation. Meanwhile, within 20 minutes, you instantly FEAR for Hemsworth's young buddy's life, he's the perfect walking dead man cliché. Cannon fodder for the coming battle. They cast Goldblum's dad (played by Judd Hirsh) as a self-aggrandizing blow-hard idiot, but he wasn't that in the first movie. And poor ex-president Whitmore has become like Russell Casse (drunken crop duster who warned people in the first movie about what aliens would do), perceived as senile. Once the big battle begins, part of it looked like it was lifted from ""London has Fallen."" The spacecraft fighter planes built by the Earthlings from alien technology are akin to a cross between ""Star Wars"" and ""Fireball XL5."" That's not a compliment. Otherwise, the special effects are fine, thought as impressive or beautiful as the effects in the first movie. Watching the special effects, I felt they would suit a Micheal Greene special on PBS better.More progressive Hollywood pandering, as President Whitmore acts as a voice-box for an alien, the same type of armed men who killed the alien in the first movie that had captured Dr. Oaken can't do the job with guns, so it's up to an African warrior to kill the thing with swords!!! For God's sake, give the poor African some GUNS so they don't look like silly Hollywood constructs. Charlotte Gainsborough is horribly miscast as some kind of anthropologist, or something. Why, just to blot her career? Still, I'm sure she appreciated the money. The weapons to kill the alien's ""Queen?"" Cold-fusion warheads. Dear God...So now were basing weapons on discredited energy theories from the 1980's? Cue the debate on sloppy, bad science in science fiction. You can debate the lack of introspection on the part of well, everyone, considering the aliens probably killed a billion people in the initial attack. I'm sure progressive Hollywood could muster some if Earthlings had done the same to each other with nuclear weapons. But that would cut into the dull, smart-alecky remarks by the soldiers that we all expect. One of the main problems with the movie is that there are too many characters. Dozens of them. It's difficult to fully-form them given that so short a time is allotted to each one. When the second alien (the good alien!) reveals itself, it sounds like fey alien from ""Plan 9 From Outer Space."" ""You are stupid, puny beings!!"" BTW, did you catch the mistake from Jeff Goldblum when he addressed a general as ""Mr. President?"" Whitmore was no where near the group. I'll stop here. There are 1000 more things you can take issue with. Best advice is to compare. Watch this movie, then go home and watch a copy of the first movie. You decide which is better, or at least good.",Independence Day - Resurgence

565,mdk-944-544737,Misunderstood,8,29 June 2016,"I've read a couple of reviews and see the same trend amongst many of them. People seem to forget that this is a Sci-Fi movie, and a sequel to the goofy 'Indepenance Day'.This movie is all about what it actually would feel like being attacked by a supreme alien race whoose goal is to suck out the iron core of our planet - using a poor technique, but powerful nonetheless. Many other reviewers lack character development, yeah, but the movie only spans over 1-2 days real-time, there's not that much development that could happen in such a short while - and in some cases there in fact IS some development. Not much, but enough. Capturing how billions of people react to annihilation while having spent 20 years building defences, i actually think this movie does a great job. The movie also captures some aspects of how a new space age would evolve with tow-truckers in space, moon bases and what not. Is the movie too short, yes, half of the movie is introduction to concepts and explanations to the viewer what we are looking at and it gets a little tiresome. But i guess its necessary to bring a long people who haven't seen ID4 at least 3-4 times like those of us who are fans of the first movie. The physics and graphics are truly awesome throughout the movie, with only a few exceptions of 'fake' looking cgi. But mostly its believable. I really liked that the queen ship dragged everything with it because of gravitational pull, it made perfect sense - but somehow that gravity stopped when it hit earth. Like someone else said, and object of that size would have annihilated earth, just by its presence ... but then the movie would have stopped. The Queen battle also made sense - She was obviously too eager and too confident of her powers to realise what kind of battle she went into. The reason why she went for the ball herself, was obviously because its a bit too delicate to let her grunts handle.

After a failed attempt to nap in my car after my shift, I decided to treat myself to a movie instead of giving into the temptations of shopping.I should have gone shopping.When the movie started I thought, ""I should have watched this in 3D."" By the time I walked out I thought, ""I should have watched 'Finding Dory.'"" It's as if whoever wrote and pieced this thing together had looked back at the original and noted the comedy, CGI, wonderful actors, lucky escapes, and thought ""Let's put in more comedy! More CGI! More actors! More lucky escapes! It will be an even bigger hit!"" It didn't work. The original, which had its goofy and silly moments, at least managed to balance it out with the drama and overall plot. This movie went way overboard in their attempts at comic relief, as well as everything else. This movie could have been over way sooner and I could have wrapped up the evening eating out with my parents, but no. They had to drag this one out. You couldn't suspend your disbelief if you tried. There were too many times when the protagonists should have been torn to shreds, shot, crushed, or blown up a hundred times over, but you KNEW that they were going to come out alive. You could predict lines and outcomes and count the clichés by the dozens. The characters were poorly written in and had little to no character development (or character for that matter), the expositions were of little to no use, and the plot points just added to the annoyance. Some of the lines were unnecessary, some characters from the original were brought back only to be killed off quickly (or killed off before the movie began).Yes, I did laugh out loud at some of the goofy moments (although in one case I tried to cover it up by coughing), but at times I ended up paying attention to my phone instead of the movie every time I got a text or notification on Facebook. It could have been a better experience if they hadn't stretched it to two hours and instead had cut out the more drawn-out scenes. The only redeeming quality was Jeff Goldblum. Take him out of the equation and this movie would have fallen to bits.Final verdict: It's one of many movies that had potential but failed to live up to it.

577,Dark_Knight23,Major ups and downs through the fairly disappointing sequel,6,29 June 2016,"I will have to admit that this movie did surprise me a bit in the visual effects department, but to a point where that was all that was going well for me as a viewer when watching. The movie did not perform as I most certainly thought it would, as it was just like many other movies that fill the category of letting the viewer able to predict everything that was going to happen.Most of the scenes to my point of view were very predictable, and I'm not talking about the major story line, but mostly about who was going to survive and who was going to save who. I have to admit that this movie made me feel like I could purely predict the future.Another point that I will make is that during the first half of the movie I was at times confused between the characters, who were just popping out of everywhere, and I was confused between the stories behind each and everyone of them. The movie looked like it was treating the audience as if they had already known every little detail about each character, and as if they knew about what they were referring to in the past about each other. It was as if it didn't matter if you had refreshed your minds with the previous film made twenty years ago or not. I will have to be honest that some parts of the dialogue were at times a bit funny, but at other times a bit raw and lazy. This proves and shows how the movie had its ups and downs, and very predictable moments. I will have to say that movie went above my expectations for visual effects, but below for most of the other main departments. And through that comment in itself and through the stupidity that they couldn't offer Will Smith enough money for him to save the world once again, is why I must rate this movie a fair, but below average score of 5.9/10.",Independence Day - Resurgence

I was worried about seeing Independence Day: Resurgence after I read the reviews on here but I thought it was fantastic! I love that the old cast is in it even without Will Smith. His ""son"" did an awesome job in place of him. The plot was very well written and had a lot of action, which I love. The only thing I didn't care for was the acting by Bill Pullman's ""daughter."" If you liked Transformers and the first Independence Day you will definitely love this movie!

When I watched the 1st movie, I feel a sense of hopelessness and fearness, but, I do not do such emotions. I think that is because 1. strategy is too simplejust shoot with gun or jet fighter. Some traps are conducted from superficial thought.I wanted to watch the cooperation with people from all the countries and sophisticated and nervous strategy such as a sporting chance.2. flat story of all the new characterIn particular, the leading cast is not enough focused, so, I could not be empathetic.",Independence Day - Resurgence
580,eranlevy,The first one was great. This one is a terrible movie.,5,27 June 2016,"I really liked the first one. It might had a supposedly simple story, but it had 3 excellent charismatic characters (Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman), it had a good sense of humour, and something worked there really well.I didn't come with high expectations from this one. Hoped it'll be a good surprise, but if not it'll be at least some fun action to enjoy on the worse case, as I rarely don't enjoy movies at cinema. However I discovered that a film of this genre can be a bad experience. Story was OK, but all the characters were extremely flat, boring and annoying. It jumped from one place to the other every minute or so, and unlike the first one something didn't work at all. I just waited for it to end and didn't enjoy anything.To make it worse, I watched at IMAX. I usually prefer that experience, and indeed the image quality was great. However the sound was way too high, and all the movie is filled with terrible annoying bass sound of space shuttles (as if they make sound at space...) and very loud explosions. 2 hours exposure to such high volume is way too much, they shouldn't pump the volume so high! 3 days later and my ears still heart. Don't do that to yourself!",Independence Day - Resurgence
581,adieldevilliers,Why Independence day?,5,28 June 2016,"I watched this movie with my sister, who claims to love 'end of the world"" movies. I enjoyed it thoroughly, but my sister sitting next to me hated it. I could feel the disdain radiating off of her throughout the run of the movie. Afterwards I asked her what she didn't like about the movie. She said the characters were boring, with no depth and the story was 1 dimensional, characters didn't connect, and she had no sympathy for the characters who died. I immediately dismissed her opinion with ""dude, it's like watching a drama and complaining about the lack of action"". She agreed that the action scenes were awesome, and the graphics were impressive. And I felt like I had won the argument. On my way home I started thinking about it. And she was correct, the characters were boring. We didn't get to really know any of them. Everything we knew was told to us. And we had to believe the backstory without the characters really having to prove to us that there were connections between them. I don't remember any of their names. I can barely link the characters together at this stage. I don't remember why Liam's character was on the moon, why that other guy was mad at him, where the girl fit in. and why she was all over this movie. First she was friendly with the pres., then she was the old pres.'s daughter, then she was friends with the dude going to the moon, chatting with the hot dude on the moon via something like Skype, then she ended up a pilot, WTF. She kind of saved the day. Super random weird events and scenarios connected by a female character that cried of queue and dated the hot guy. What I am trying to say, this movie actually sucked. I could have totally come up with a better story line than the one that was used. It was a wasted opportunity. It could have been another ""Jurassic World"" success story. JW proved that people like straight forward movies, that are super predictable, but impressive to watch. A roller-coaster ride that you leave at the theme park and not spend months trying to understand. Even if they just tried a little bit, it could have been great. So if you love theme park rides, with impressive graphics. This is the movie for you. If you hate soppy love stories, this is the movie for you. A side note, why was it called Independence Day in the first place? Were the earth colonized and people enslaved to serve an alien race? Did the humans all lose their freedom somewhere? Were they taxed unfairly, controlled and dismissed as inferior. And now they had to free themselves from their oppressors.What are they claiming their independence from?",Independence Day - Resurgence
582,jplescha,The movie is actually quite good!,8,5 July 2016,"I will start with the negative. The movie simply suffers from editing. I am not sure why and who decided to do it most probably to make it fit 2h schedule. So I am sure that there is much more footage which simply did not make it in this Cut and it would have made all the difference in the story and flow of events.Having said this and understanding this I think the movie is a Great sequel to the first one, it is an entertaining movie, and the story thus far introduces depth. The first was a one shot deal, they came we vanquished them victory the end. But now they not only came fro a second time but there are many more of them there is a resistance too there is a Galactic War going on. This has the potential of Star Wars in our Galaxy Saga, spawning even Long lasting Series down the line like Stargate and a replacement for Star Trek. I simply cannot Wait for the Third installment!

To make more money, of course. Was this sequel necessary? No. However, I feel it was much better than the awful reviews would have you believe. It would have been nice to have Will Smith in the movie. Jeff Goldblum's David was a bit too serious in this movie. And by the way, why don't they tell you what happened to his ex-wife who is such a prominent character in the original? It was nice to have Dr. Okun back. Of course, people who have been laying in bed for 20 years do not jump right out of bed. The Warlord character was a great addition to the story and, I think Liam Hemsworth did pretty good as Jake. The CGI was very good. Overall, an entertaining movie and a worthy sequel. I am looking forward to the next movie where we go out into space and kick some alien booty.",Independence Day - Resurgence

Grant it, I don't think it's nearly as good as the first. But recall that the first movie got just 2-1/2 stars when it opened. I can understand if you plunked down $10 to see this in the movies you would expect something amazing, but I watched ID2 several times on DVD, and cannot agree with some of negative comments. On its own, it is entertaining. I didn't find it boring or overly long. It is what a movie should be--entertainment--and no one should have expected something more. Of course, it's all a matter of personal taste. The 2014 Godzilla, for example, won praise yet I found that boring and far less entertaining than the 1998 version, which was highly criticized.

Most of the cast just went through the motions, many of the younger ones ought to be seeking other forms of employment. The CGI was epic in scale but not in originality,the story hackneyed and clichéd. OK it's not a film to be taken with any sort of seriousness, but this was just poor.On the opening afternoon there were just 5 of us in a 200 seat theatre - but it was a dull day and I guess most people were out voting in the EU referendum (or working!), but maybe the mediocre press reviews had an effect.They shouldn't bother to resurrect the aliens unless they can bring something a bit more original to the screen.

588,eriktrapper,All about your expectations,5,27 December 2016,"Just watch this after re-watching the original film. Since I saw all the reviews completely bashing the film I went in with very low expectations. It was alright, have seen much worse. I have noticed the more of an attachment one has to the first film the more they scored this one down. Light entertainment, lot's of predictable, cheesy scenes, special effects in line with much of what is produced these days and of course like the first 'Murika, if you get my meaning. But all this said, the first film was hardly a great film, it was a fun watch, fun special effects and in the end predictable and cheesy. The film became iconic probably more for the blowing up the White House scene, which we all remember the trailer and reactions in theaters went it came out. Will Smith not in this film and everyone making a big deal about it. Not missed, anyone could have played his role with their comedic take, so someone plays his son in a main role. Had they not killed off Randy Quaid we could have had more of his real life personality on screen, boy those viral videos of him showed us how little he actually acted in that film.This was an light fluff film that you watch on the plane because everything else you have seen or is just pretty bad. Going into with low expectations helps. Sequels rarely deliver and I believe there is a number 3 lined up, they definitely left it open. But the first one was a 6 if this was a 5, calling it a 2 or 3 suggest that you wanted the film to be something and are mad that it didn't out do the original. It could have done so much more and was pretty mediocre, but then again so could have the first",Independence Day - Resurgence

In many more words this film is nothing short of a travesty. With a paper thin plot which gets worse as the film develops it makes you wonder what they've been doing all this time. In that time it seems Bill Pullman forgot how to act, Roland Emmerich forgot how to direct and Will Smith just forgot to turn up. Without him this film lacked any intentional comedy relief, the only joke being the film itself, and I for one am not laughing. Never in the history of film has there been so much disparity between 2 films in the same series. The original had everything you needed from a blockbuster. comedy, drama, romance, action, suspense and is widely regarded as a classic for that reason. It's sequel can only claim one of those.action, and that action is boring and idiotic. Attempts to re-enact scenes from the original film with updated special effects and worse acting are pathetic, desperate and bordering on plagiarism. This is the perfect example of 'if it ain't broke don't fix it'. An unnecessary sequel which should have never made it out of the script writing room and the end result makes you question whether it ever even made it to the room. Terrible beyond belief.

593,randahl-935-28881,Not for the intelligent viewer,1,23 June 2016,"This is one of those movies where the grown up audience knows after 5 minutes, that the target group is teenagers. Even in the middle of the movie's major crisis, the whole world pauses, as two young characters have to talk intimately, because it is just so important, for she's hot and he's so cute, so the less important end of our civilization will just have to wait.Unlike many famous sci-fi movies, this movie is not true to science at all. If some young script writer thought that it would be ""dope"" for gravity to be ""defeatable"", then gravity is ""defeatable"", whatever that means. Small objects that are hidden can be monitored in detail by the good guys, while objects the size of a continent are completely undetectable. There are dozens of these examples where the movie makes no sense.The humor in this movie has no finesse. Watching it is like being at dinner with the distant uncle who is not funny but keeps cracking jokes, though no one is really laughing but him.Most of the time, the dialogues sound like a wacky parody, in the way Doc spoke with Martin in Back to the Future. They even copied the Doc character so directly, that there is an actual long haired, wacky old man in a lab coat talking in a nutty way while experimenting with sci-fi technology.One thing does work, though, the computer graphics are impressive.

But it really is that bad.The Independence Day franchise could off had some beef, the first was a poor film but has (to some degree) developed a ""it's that bad it's a cult classic"" label. The re-boot could of taken the story on by being a little bit more serious, made it more dark and menacing. I'm not saying it should of gone all Alien but at least built on a fountain of a good story which was poorly executed the first time round.What we're left with is a titanic mess of a story, a woeful disregard for acting, not all that convincing special effects and a car crash of a story board, it has more clichés and set plays that the first movie but the characters have no depth. It doesn't help that the actors playing these parts have to dish out the sort of dialogue you'd expect in a 1950's US sci-fi comic book. The acting deserves a special mention....it really is that bad.I won't ruin it for you by trying to describe the story, in fact after watching it it's hard to actual piece together anyway so I'll leave the pain to your eyeballs. If you go into the cinema expecting to take this film seriously you'll leave horrified by how bad it really is. If you go into the cinema expecting to see a modern B-movie you may just get some entertainment from it, plan to laugh at it not be gripping the arm rest in suspense.The first movie brought us special effects to hide the poor acting and story behind, special effects have moved on and this movie fails to give that impressive treat again. They've tried to do everything bigger but in doing so made it worse, there's nothing new but you can see some poorly rendered aliens which look worse than the first lot.I feel I want to type more but it's just not worth it. it really is that bad.",Independence Day - Resurgence

This time around, the fight is decidedly less one sided, as humanity has reverse engineered the alien technology to use as defense. Also, the special effects didn't quite knock my socks off as much as the original, as I saw the first film when it first came out when I was in high school. But it was still entertaining. The film is definitely watchable, even without Will Smith. Plus, it set it up for a 3rd film, which will feature us going to attack them, with the help of other races. That might be neat to see.

It just didn't pull me in. The story is there but ultimately goes nowhere and serves no purpose other than to create an excuse for the movie. The characters come off as generic, bare-bones and none of them can really make you feel any empathy for them in the end. In my opinion the only thing this movie has going for it is the CGI. It's an action movie to watch when you're really really bored. But please don't tell me it's an Independence Day movie because it's not. It has none of the great acting that mattered in the previous one, none of the directorial flare that gave the other movie a personality of it's own. A good movie makes you feel something, it pulls you into it's world. This one does nothing of the sort.

(Well, no one I've ever known or would want to know.) Completely puerile. The story is weak from the first moments. The worlds created are totally unrealistic. -A world largely comprised of unified nations with exceptions that are offensively stereotypical.The endless, mindless, one-liners -- put forth like a bad comedian's rehearsed laugh lines.

608,filmeddows,Great reprise of a classic Sci-Fi Disaster Film,7,21 October 2016,"After reading so many crappy comments I nearly didn't watch it. So glad I did. I loved the original and this was an amazing reprise with enough cameo's to keep you very happy. A truly great sequel. Brent Spiner's Cameo alone is excuse enough to watch this film. The end even leaves it open for the possibility of another film with epic proportions. Don't watch the original in preparations as the formula and techniques used in this one are very similar. Don't read any more comments, just watch it. I regret not seeing at the cinema.They have substituted Will Smiths hero's journey with a white guy who flew with his son. There is a similar back story to this similar to that of Wesley Crusher and Tom Paris's accident at Starfleet Academy from Star Trek. That of which was stolen from one of Isaac Asimov books. It would have been great to have Will Smith reprising his role playing out that back story, But if you can get past the old switcharooney of the new generation taking on the main roles then you'll love it.",Independence Day - Resurgence

The Japanese was edited and the characters magically all spoke English. Now as an adult, when I watch these type of old Godzilla movies I laugh and shake my head because it's poorly made and the acting is just horrible but what does a 6 year old know? I know I'm not the only adult who will admit loving horrible movies as a child. Well I felt like that today when I took my 6 year old son to see this movie. I actually wanted to walk out but he wanted to stay and put me through 2 hours of hell to watch this crap. Everything is bad from the script, effects to the horrible acting. This movie is not even worthy of Red Box when it comes out. Will Smith was smart to not have any to do with this movie. When my son is old enough I'm going to make him watch this movie from beginning to end and remind him that I sat through this crappy movie for him when was 6 years old!",Independence Day - Resurgence

However this movie is void of passion, void of wit, void of nearly anything that makes a good blockbuster film. While Jeff Goldblum still carries his weight, his would be comedic lines are set in such ridiculous situations they are unfunny. Judd Nelson is fun (the sole highlight) and is used well for his role. However , the entire ""next gen"" crew of actors are dull and look like they are bored, in a high school production. There is no chemistry at all! The special effects are pretty good, but when cut with live action the scenes fall flat. As far as the sound effects it seems like they took the entire Transformers sound effects library and then cut & pasted. This film looks rushed and poorly directed. For a fan of the first film, it's a major let down. Netflix this one. I am sure they will try to milk the brand for sequels, but unless they change director and writers, I see some direct to disc titles in their future...going quietly into the night.",Independence Day - Resurgence
612,mekreslins,I can't believe I paid $8.00!,1,24 June 2016,"There was not one redeeming quality to this movie; in fact, the producers should be force to refund our money. No chemistry, no humor, not one good scene, rather, we spent the ride home listing the top 10 worst scenes only to realize we needed a Top 100 list!There were multiple disjointed scenes where the script writer obviously was not concerned. For example, in the opening scenes, we're told of a world at peace where there had been no wars for 20 years. A couple of scenes, we're treated to a scene where a ""warlord"" is introduced who appeared anything but peaceful.Bill Pullman needs a cane at the beginning of the movie, near the end, he's a Top Gun pilot willing to sacrifice his life to deliver the package. The list could go on. It really was that bad.Do not waste your time. I was prepared for a mediocre film that was mildly entertaining but rather received a movie that was beyond bad.

613,prodromosregalides,A worthy successor,10,26 June 2016,"I am forced to vote 10 , because there are extreme people who vote 1 or 2. The movie is just as good as the first one and maybe a little better.The only reason, some are not satisfied is because it's not a new concept. Of course the first impression leaves a more distinct memory in us. It's always like this. But being mad because it does not affect you as a novel story, is unfair.Now , objectively the movie is a 7-8 , but so was the first one. It has a good plot, far better visual effects, and some good acting here and there. It is not a movie that addresses deep meanings, nor does it pretend on artistic excellence, though it does address existential problems, maybe the most serious ones, no matter how much they are ridiculed by people asleep or who want others to remain asleep.The disdain because it does show physically inconsistent events is not justified, because it is a sci-fi and it has to have fiction in it, so the disdain is snobbish. Even, ""interstellar"" hailed as scientifically accurate , has some ""atrocious"" scientific inconsistencies, yet I didn't see anyone disgusted by them; not only that, even political propaganda, still no one complained. It was bland and uninspiring, still no one teared their clothes. It had some really good acting , but it takes more than that to make a good sci-fi movie.So, Independence Resurgence ,is all about the return of the aliens , that are being informed by a distress call when their fleet is destroyed during the first contact. This time, though, they do not come with small energy weapons only , but with huge gravitational generators and with tools that can manipulate heavenly bodies. For the first time we come in close contact with their biological-social structure . We have always known they were a hive-like race, but now we are introduced to the crown of their hive , their queen, a cool spectacular monster.They defeat the aliens by a way similar to that in the first movie, bait and kill, hide and infiltrate. People of the earth come also in contact, with a race unfriendly to the aliens, from which they are informed of a long background history of the alien attackers as well as the possibility to acquire new scientific knowledge and technological capabilities.Overall a cool sci-fi , that will give you 2 pleasant cinema hours; if you like sci-fi of course.",Independence Day - Resurgence
614,tobymacdonnell,Yeah... well... Ummm... Hmmm...,1,13 August 2016,"I went to see the original in 1996 with my Dad, I was 12. It was at the very dawn of advanced CGI and surround sound. The bullet that bounced around the cinema after having hit the Alien shield was awesome. THAT, was an good film, a fight for humanities survival. Yes it was a 90's sci-fi, yes it was cheesy, and no it probably wasn't classic cinema. But I watched it more times through on VHS than I can remember.This was a wholehearted... MEH... The CGI didn't seem any more advanced, nothing new. And I will not being buying it on Blu-ray. It was nothing special, another Hollywood ejaculation of crap to the lowest common denominator. Lasers and explosions and running and shouting and ""ahhhh"", just for lasers and explosions and ""woo big guns"" sake.Oh the 10 second plan to save the world works... yay... lets get married... NO!I've been tired of this for years... I refuse to go to the cinema, and pay for something not worth my money. I will happily pay to see an intelligent, exciting and extravagant sci-fi epic...

The original 1996 movie has a mediocre plot, but that movie had the energy at the highest level. This movie has same mediocre plot but missing the enthusiasm.It also had other serious problems too.Acting was very bad from almost all the actors,especially the new actors(may be the leading actress was OK). Old actors were not upto the mark (Goldblum was good though). The actor played the president in original movie was pale in this movie. The lead young actor and the actor played Will Smith's son has no acting quality in them unfortunately.The final third of the movie was very disappointing. Felt no suspense at all.CGI was OK - Editing felt OFF in some sequences - A lot of scientific facts were described through dialogues which were hard to follow. That killed the flows of the movie.They added many characters that doesn't make sense. Like the Chinese actress. Her acting was terrible too.Thank god it made less than 400M. It was a disaster and it should be.",Independence Day - Resurgence

618,dkanungoe,Definitely not anything like the earlier part....,1,11 October 2016,"In one word I will say that this movie is Awful. The script was horrible so was both the acting and direction. The new characters introduced in the movie were loosely tied and had no chemistry among themselves. Even worse most of the old characters from the earlier part whom we all liked the most were killed one after another without any logical explanation. At a point of time it felt as if the movie went in a killing spree as all those characters were killed in some way or another. I guess even the Director had no idea what he was doing with such a nonsense script and with all the confusing characters.I am writing this review only because I got so irritated after watching this movie that I wanted to warn others just to stay away from this disgusting movie. It could well be nominated for the most horrible movie of 2016 and easily win by a huge margin. So guys don't waste your time, the trailer is good no doubt but the final product is not only boring but completely makes no sense. I will rate it 1/10 and for time wasting 10/10........",Independence Day - Resurgence

Of course the movie could have been better, but it's still a good and fun movie to watch. My biggest mistake was reading all the reviews out there before I saw the movie, not because of spoilers, but because of those people who love to criticize everything as though they were movie experts, witch led to me having low expectations about watching this movie, but I'm glad that I did watch it. Whoever reads my review, even if just 1 person, please do watch this movie and judge it by yourself.

620,lukechigh,Like a boring Michael Bay movie with less but shots!,3,7 August 2016,"First of all, I was excited for this movie, I loved the original, I think Roland Emmerich CAN, not is but can, be a good director! When will smith didn't sign on to it, I got less excited, when I saw the trailers I really got less excited. Starting off, (kind of a spoiler so i checked the box just in case) the way they kill of will smith is stupid! ""He crashed in a test flight of new alien ship"" Such a dumb way to kill off a great character! His ""son"" in the film, is so annoying, he tries to be Will Smith but ends up sounding like Jaden Smith *groan The plot is just plain stupid, the dialogue is terrible, the cgi is OK for the most part but in certain scenes in notably quite bad! The characters try to be funny but just aren't. There are about 50 subplots,none of which really arise to anything, ill rank them for you, there's Jeff Goldblums romance (1/10), stereotype, some could call racist, African war lord plot (3/10), liam hemsworths friend lust for Asian pilot subplot (0.1/10), the ex presidents mental issues (4/10), jeff goldblum dad rescues kid bus subplot (-10/10) and so on and so on and so on... They kill of characters you don't care for but are afraid to kill off characters you do kind of care for! The action scenes are boring, plot is predictable, after one character revealed about the alien queen, i though to myself i bet they shoot down the ship, think its dead, then the alien queen pops up and fights on earth. and it happened!!! The action is so repetitive that at a time it became plain boring! Would not recommend 3/10",Independence Day - Resurgence
621,sunnyboyindian,they just don't have the presence to match Will Smith's hotshot pilot from the earlier film,4,25 June 2016,"In 1996, Independence Day became an instant sci-fi classic largely because its cutting-edge visual effects allowed director Roland Emmerich to mount an ambitious alien-invasion epic that felt thrilling and new and unlike anything we'd seen until then. I still remember being blown out of my mind at the sight of the White House exploding into smithereens? In the years since, everyone from Emmerich himself and Michael Bay, to the folks at Marvel and DC, has found new and innovative ways to destroy the world and flatten entire cities. So much so that it's hard to find a blockbuster today that doesn't end in colossal digital carnage.But the formula's gotten rusty, and frankly CGI has got to the point where we've seen pretty much everything there is to see. How do you make a sequel then to the film that more or less invented the modern disaster movie? The answer, according to Emmerich – throw everything you've got at the screen, and hope that some of it sticks.Set two decades after mankind's triumph against the alien invaders of the last film, Independence Day: Resurgence unfolds during a happier time on Earth. There is peace, but we're much better prepared to handle similar attacks, having taken that alien technology and developed more sophisticated spacecraft and weaponry. Most of the survivors of the original film return, with former president Thomas Whitmore (Bill Pullman) plagued by visions of the aliens' impending return, and former cable guy David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) bumped up to the top job at the Earth Space Defence. Even Dr Brackish Okun (Brent Spiner) has woken up from a 20-year coma.Conspicuous by his absence however, is Will Smith's character, Captain Steven Hiller, who died while testing Earth's first fighter jet based on alien techalthough it could be from reading this script, who knows! In his place we get Hiller's son Dylan (Jesse Usher), who has none of Will Smith's charisma. He plays a fighter pilot, alongside Jake Morrisson (Liam Hemsworth) and Jake's fiancée Patricia Whitmore (Maika Monroe), the ex-president's pretty daughter. The young 'uns are entrusted with firing back at the dastardly critters when they finally show upthis time in larger numbers, with more ammo, and in a single mothership so massive it spans across the entire Atlantic Ocean.Expectedly Emmerich fires on all cylinders when it comes to sheer spectacle. So it's not enough to merely uproot and upend major landmarks like Dubai's Burj Khalifa and Malaysia's Petronas Towers, they're dropped like matchsticks upon other landmarks like the London Eye and the Tower Bridge. It's the film's most audacious set-piece, and it's meant to be thrilling stuff, intended to make you giddy with excitement. But it's hard not to drown in the sea of pornographic destruction when the film throws out disaster after disaster, barely pausing for you to get your breath back.There are also plenty air-bound skirmishes – dogfights in the skies – but very quickly you're consumed by an overwhelming feeling of déjà vu. Only Goldblum gets a few moments of wisecracking dialogue in what otherwise feels like a soulless, deeply cynical film, whose makers typically don't bother with showing us the repercussions of such widespread global destruction. It feels as if no one really dies or is hurt despite half the planet being completely savaged.The younger cast, they just don't have the presence to match Will Smith's hotshot pilot from the earlier film. We also don't get one clear hero to root for. Apart from a few impressive bits of sheer CGI spectacle, the film is sorely lacking in memorable moments and ends up feeling like a slog. It doesn't even deliver on the promise of dumb fun. For that, it needed to be a little less dumb and a lot more fun",Independence Day - Resurgence

But at least it had some class, despite of the bad story. Sure it had bad jokes and lots of awfully cheesy moments, but this movie is cheese only. Smelly cheese.This movie I more like a bad B movie, stuffed with great CGI. The dialogues .... argh.... please.... I do not want to think about it.Actually...

623,vijaypadiyar,Even tacky low budget sci-fi movies are better than this,4,11 July 2016,"Terrible, terrible, terrible. I don't know what's wrong with Hollywood movie directors these days. They wield CGI effects like a kid who's found his dad's gun.Worldwide mass destruction to these guys appears no more serious an event than a common cold. What else explains the protagonist feeling smug and proud of his flying skills when half of the planet has just been destroyed in front of his eyes by the alien invaders?There is no logic, story or coherence in this movie. The only thing that makes it slightly better than movies like Sharktopus, Arachnoquake, etc. is the higher CGI budget, that's it. For all practical purposes, this movie belongs to the same category as those tacky low budget sci-fi handouts. At least with them you watch the movie expecting no better and sometimes they pleasantly surprise you. But not here.If there's anything worse than this movie, it's the near certain prospect of a sequel that promises to be worse.I really hope Hollywood directors stop making movies that offer nothing beyond meaningless CGI action. 2012 was a novel experience, but after that it's just gotten dreadfully routine with Transformers, Avengers, San Andreas, etc. everyone just aping the same crappy global destruction formula.",Independence Day - Resurgence
624,juan-66806,Action packed Sci-fi with some poor acting performances,6,29 June 2016,"I knew this film was not going to be anything like the original back in 96, people need to understand its been 20 YEARS since the original was released. So if you thought it will be anything like the original then you must be living in the stone ages.People you need to adapt to the ages!In my opinion the positives outweigh the negatives.Few psitive facts: -The whole experience with CGI, special effects, sound track was great. -The way the story was build to potentially create more sequels is great. - Great to see some of the veterans from the 1996 original. - The directors created a new platform to explore other ways the film can go as the earth can only be threaten to be destroyed so many times.Few negatives: -some of the new cast members should not have even been considered for audition... e.g Jessie Usher, Liam hemsworth and WORST OF ALL Travis Tope Probably the most disgusting form of acting I have seen in many years. Fox please hear my prayers, if you are considering to use this guy for the next film please kill his character early on the film so you can save us a whole 2 hours of cringiness and awkwardness. We all know you have plenty of capital to invest in top acting talent, don't ruin the legacy you created with this film by making petty acting hires like this guy.So to sum it all up the whole platform of independence day can go on in the history books and in my opinion this can only be done by making sure the right actors play the right roles please stop making petty hires and recruit some strong characters that will make the film patriotic as it is suppose to make us feel.",Independence Day - Resurgence

626,shalinabaysan,"Pretty okay, but didn't quite live up to the original",5,25 June 2016,"I was so exited to watch Resurgence since my dad told me about it. When I found out about half of the original cast members were reprising their roles, the excitement tripled. But as I walked out of that movie theater, I was little underwhelmed. Perhaps I just need to watch it another time to fully grasp it.Given, it was a little disappointing to find that Will Smith would not be returning, whatever the reason may have been. But it begs the question on what role would his character have had, had he still been included? Did his absence force the death of Dylan's mom, or was that going to happen either way (to have that understanding between him and Jake)? How much of the script would have changed had he been included? However, I appreciated that they had written his character off in such a way that didn't seem forced, so to speak.Furthermore, the movie was cliché-galore! There was so much of ""if we do this, then we'll defeat them for sure"" happening that I began to wonder when the actual movie would end. It might have just been me, and I know that's the road most end-of-the-world movies take, but it seemed a little excessive. Yes, the obvious resolutions would have been even more cliché and we would've been deprived of more action sequences, but in return, we got some considerably corny overkill, IMO.The overall movie was pretty okay. It did a great job at setting up the next installment, unlike what BvS: Dawn of Justice had attempted (and failed) to do. I quite enjoyed the graphics and the score. The main cast showed their excellent skills with acting, except for the president and some of the COs; I feel like they were portrayed as ""trying too hard.""",Independence Day - Resurgence
627,siggy-46709,Not worth going to the theater for,4,28 June 2016,"*contains spoilers*If the fact that Will Smith wasn't in this one isn't bad enough, Vivica A Fox (Jasmine Hiller) doesn't get much screen time and gets killed off fairly early in the movie. None of the new characters ever develop into anything more than fleeting acquaintances, you simply don't get a chance to know them enough to care about them, you don't get emotional over them when they get killed. Not like in the first one, where you felt bad when the first lady died in the hospital after her helicopter crashed, or when Will Smith's wingman was shot down. And pretty much everyone in the theater shed a tear when Russel Casse sacrificed himself to save the planet. You cried and felt proud with his kids. There was nothing like it in this one everything felt rushed, none of the scenes were elaborated on enough. Even the destruction scenes were not memorable, you just remember seeing a lot of rubble everywhere. Although most people noted that the Eiffel Tower somehow survived in this one :D When the first ID4 came out we saw it in the theater on July 4th with our entire family, my kids were preteens then. The theater was packed and when the movie ended everyone stood up and clapped. It was a great moment. When my now adult daughter and I went to see Independence Day Resurgence, the theater had maybe 15 people in it, if that. There was not much excitement at all, no laughter because there were no funny moments like in the first one. Everyone remembers the one-liners delivered by Will Smith and the funny exchanges between Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum or during Judd Hirsch's prayer scene where one person said he wasn't Jewish and Judd Hirsch said: ""nobody's perfect"". In this sequel there was not much more than an overload of super fast moving CGI imagery, in true Roland Emmerich fashion, much like in 2012. I can only guess that this movie was originally much longer and was chopped all to hell to fit into a two-hour time slot. It was a real mess with mediocre acting (even from the returning actors), it seemed like this time their heart just wasn't in it.",Independence Day - Resurgence

The movie took place exactly 20 years after the first movie on the exact same day which didn't appeal to me as the chances of that are extremely low. But if i was to put that aside, it was a very American movie and set up squeals for the franchise.

The Imax 3d seat prices are basically legalized armed robbery, the 3d was fine though and the FX didn't look like crap even with a screen of that size. Definitely could have gone to see it in 2d and not miss muchAll in all I had a great time with my kid and don't understand the hating on this movie at all (but then again I felt the same about the lone ranger, so maybe it's me).

As with many action movies today, there is little humor, romance, or character development to get you caring about the characters and their story. CG is totally overdone in this movie in fact it was the movie. Characters are totally dwarfed by technology, another reason why showing their humanness could have made a difference.When will Hollywood get the message that bigger isn't necessarily better?

637,parveshsingh,Seriously Underrated for few mistakes.,1,26 June 2016,"Movie Plot: 8.5/10 Graphics:9.5/10 Acting: 7/10 Loopholes: 10-12 I would say that do not go for the ratings. This is the kind of movie that one would agree to see instead of some unbelievable superhero garbage. This movie will make the Independence day fans happy for sure.If you keep yourself calm and do not fall for false bad ratings you can easily find a reason to give this a good chance.I have rated this movie low so that if you reading bad reviews you can see the other side as well. This movie is unpredictable, I can assure that no one can tell about the movie where its going to end. I was captured in the grip of the story that I never fell bored at any scene. Movie is well made by taking the story to next level during the continuity.I would prefer that everyone should watch the first part or you might have trouble understanding few things and loose some critical scenes. Part 1 had given little knowledge about aliens. This movie opens about the their leader, how their mother ship is from inside, they have a kind of language, hints about their origin, and why they want earth... rest are spoilers. Aliens were quite clear to see in this part. Humans have moved on further with future enhancements. Technology, generation, everything has developed. We can find loopholes in few things though.There are mistakes in other high rated movies as well like The Prestige but why is the world so downheartedly giving it 1 or 2. That's pure injustice to the kind of quality plot the movie delivers. It surely doesn't deserve lower rating than Transformers 2 or 3.",Independence Day - Resurgence
638,sabriyasowers,Terrible,1,25 April 2021,"The first movie is one of my favorites and is far superior. Too many characters, no tension build up, just boring. Writers for this movie sucks. The white haired scientist clearly DIES in the first movie. The military guy checks his pulse and then lets him be. He never calls for a medic or anything. Why bring this guy back? Hollywood is a joke. I'm sure there are some true talented writers out there who never get a chance and yet the ones who wrote this were given this opportunity? The acting is so bad. Who the heck is the lead? The ones they bring back must have needed the money? The lady president in this has stupid one liners like ""Let's do it"" etc. No depth at all to these characters. Also the old man from the previous movie the kids helped down from the boat unconscious? How did they manage that? Loool.",Independence Day - Resurgence
639,bks1978-1,Stay away - you'll thank me later,3,26 April 2017,"How to follow up the giant blockbuster from 1996? First, give it a gigantic ($165 million) budget, get together a few of the actors (Goldblum, etc.) from the original, mix in several new faces so you have a good continuation of story lines load it up with SFX and finally hire writers who know what they are doing. Put all that together and this movie should be able to pull in tremendous earnings, possibly challenging the profit from the first Independence Day film. Everything was there to make this a perfect storm of cheesy summer blockbuster and profit giant.Sadly, it seems as though the studio forgot to hire anyone to write a script for this film and threw something together a few days before filming began. Many characters appear and disappear in the plot with virtually no explanation, the plot is...stupid, and I found myself not caring about a single character and even rooting for the aliens to kill everyone just to make it all stop.This movie had such tremendous potential - 20 years to get a script just right and an enormous budget. Whoever is responsible for this lame attempt at a movie should be embarrassed. 3/10 is being extraordinarily generous and is only that high for the special effects.",Independence Day - Resurgence

I can say the best part of this movie was when the lights turned on the saloon. A guy was telling on way out that he wants his money back. To make such movie also requires a great effort and we see a such long cast list at the end. Such mess would be achieved only by that many people. I am sure my 11 years old son would write better script. Same stupid fashion still ongoing and old actors again included after 20 years later which we all were waiting for with four eyes open :)) It is not surprising that Will Smith did not participate in this soup as he has enough intelligence to understand this movie an absolute garbage and he did not spoil his reputation. Good call Will! I am giving 4 out of 10 and I consider this score is really generous. I am in good mood today and I ate a great breakfast this morning so it reflects on the score :)) Yes this movie is not fun, boring and the worst choice to waste your time.

642,khitb77,Thought provoking it is not,7,14 November 2016,"First off despite the many flaws and obvious shortcomings of the aliens reliance on their queen I actually quite enjoyed this film.Perhaps it's because I'm sleep deprived (thanks to my 14 month old son) but I can forgive all of the well documented plot holes etc that others have written about, my wife and I quite enjoyed the film.Thankfully for us no brain power is required, it's a popcorn movie and to be fair it was never going to be a complex story, it's no Interstellar or even the Martian in terms of other recent sci-fi movies.I do think that some of the grievances that people have with the plot are just showing themselves up because they've actually misunderstood the film (worrying because they themselves criticise the films intelligence).In terms of comparing it to Independence Day from 1996, well lets not forget that that movie was no Oscar winner in terms of script, acting or story. I still shudder when I think back to Bill Pullman's line ""so it's an organic life form"" after him viewing the dead aliens on display at Area 51... Yes President Whitmore, them being dead and having fleshy bodies is an indication of them being organic! ID:4 or whatever it was called was so heavy on the US patriotism that for us viewers outside the US it was quite hard to watch at times.My biggest issue with Independence Day: Resurgence was the fact that if the queen dies they leave the planet!?! Erm, hadn't the aliens ever considered that as being a bit of potential weakness? Especially as even we weak humans knew that their backs were their soft spot. Your majesty you really need to upgrade your back plating I'd say, especially if you yourself are going to invade the planet (admittedly her multiple hands were forced in that). The fact that no queen has ever been killed... EVER is no excuse for complacency in my book!As for the benign alien, who is here to help us. I looked at that sphere and just thought of Alan Rickman's Marvin the paranoid android from Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. Copyright infringement anyone?Just watch the movie if you've got 2 hours to kill and you're like me, knackered and incapable of dealing with anything more complex than the Teletubbies or Peppa Pig!",Independence Day - Resurgence
643,sanjeev_madhavan,Worst film of the decade so far.,1,27 June 2016,"In 1996, Independence day came out, it was a super fun Pop corm flick.Independence day Resurgence However is one of the WORST movies of this decade.There are uninteresting one-dimensional characters that you forget about every time they go off scene. There is a plot (in there somewhere?) that just exists so that the characters could do the things they do.In the end anyway the humans win cause (C'mon you already knew that), that's what everyone wants, but we DON't know how and why the humans succeed.Well anyway, after you watch the movie - a day or two later, you will end up giving yourself a hard time as you get utterly frustrated at the director and the studio for ever green lightning this PoS. And writing this review is how I am letting off some steam. I truly am so disgusted.

Wasn't.,2,23 July 2016,"Such a shame that they made this so poorly when it could have been so good with all the excellent actors, massive amounts of money, and huge basis that this film started out with. Unfortunately, even with all the CGI and effects, this 'action' film is boring. It doesn't keep you interested, there is no character development, and even the fight scenes are fairly poor. Feels like it should have been longer and then they'd have been able to put more explanation in. And why oh why oh why was Charlotte Gainsbourg cast? Worst acting I've ever seen and the main recent for my low score and opinion of this movie. Thought she was terrible and ruined every single scene that she was involved in. Should have been good.

Besides the CGI (that I think it's where they spent 90% of the estimated 165M budget) everything is completely nonsense. I was expecting something like the original, it had it's flaws but it managed to have a decent script with a guideline, some content and characters that we could enjoy. This one is just bad in every aspect except the CGI. It has no content at all and for a sci-fi movie it lacks the minimal common sense. Through almost all the movie I felt like a donkey looking to a wall asking myself countless times ""How?!"". I would rather watch Sharnado's or something similar, at least I know what to expect and would get.",Independence Day - Resurgence
646,shmugle-666-722189,Failed To Satisfy,3,1 July 2016,"This is my first time writing a review. I should write reviews more often considering how many films I have seen. With that said let me begin.I was a fan of the original Independence Day. I was fairly excited that they were going to be making this sequel. Maybe I got my hopes up a bit, however expectations aside this film fell short on so many levels. I tend to want movies I watch to be believable on some level. I want to feel as if the events, scenarios, plot and characters are or could be real. That is a personal preference that allows me to reflect on how the movie is written and how well the actors play their roles. Resurgence offers no in depth character development, sub par acting, a ridiculous script, unrealistic so called action sequences and overall boring plot to say the least.Specifics: The bad: - Noticed four scenes that were similar to the movie Pearl Harbor. The fact that I noticed this bothered me as Hollywood seems to be running out of ideas. 1. Bombers (with nukes) go in to attack a target and eventually crash in what is basically a rice paddy. 2. President/former president has a walking impairment in which they set aside their aides (wheelchair, cane) and stand free to give a motivational speech. 3. Two fighter pilots who have a previous/ongoing feud with each other unite in the face of danger. 4. Pilots make the same maneuver during battle where they fly straight at each other then turn (this may be an actual maneuver but it is overused in movies and thus a cliché). - Script is terrible, jokes are not comical when meant to be. - Reactions to the situation at hand completely unrealistic. - The supposed superior world destroying being is in fact unintelligent. For instance the queen chases a bus for no reason whatsoever besides making the movie longer. I would say this is equal to the main fight scene in Captain America Civil War (the airport with Spiderman and Antman) where something that is meant to be a climax of action becomes nothing more than a boring meaningless waste of time. Seriously in Captain America Civil War Spiderman and Antman added nothing to that movie besides filler. - Characters are all clichés and offer no depth. - Predictable plot - Boring overallThe Good - Enjoyed the CGI at the very least - Will Smith was not in it. I feel like he is an actor past his prime and would have made this film worse.",Independence Day - Resurgence
647,Cutiee108,Should have paid Will!,1,4 April 2021,Maybe if they paid Will Smith it would have been better? Recasting Patricia Whitmore was also a big mistake I feel. Then the story line itself just was poorly done. Could have been such a great movie!! Such a shame!,Independence Day - Resurgence
648,dklifestyle,OK for one time watching,7,28 December 2016,"Not sure what to say about this film, but I had fun, somehow. I gave it a 7, but it would be better a 6.5 in my opinion. I was 16 when the first film came out. My dad drove me and a friend of mine to the local cinema. I was so impressed after it, so was very much looking forward to watch the second part, but after I had heard how bad this movie is, I did not want to watch it anymore. Today I was bored and watched the movie anyways.So what can I say - yeah sure - no Will Smith, it's his ""son"", who is taking the main role and a lot of new actors, where you have to figure out who is who. A lot of action and special effects, what I really liked about it. But to be honest, I like alien and science fiction movies generally, so that's why I probably liked this film.In the end, it is probably like the name of the movie already says: Resurgence - a lot of old actors and the story, which I really liked many years ago. Watching it, you will forgive bad acting, a bit bad story and all those goofs. Jesus, it is already 20 years ago, I felt a bit like being back in that time, in 1996.

I for one am tired of all this superhero movie, I think civil war is so bad, it doesn't even follow the comic's story line instead it's just about captain and bucky relationship. IDR has great special effects and the 3D was done right unlike x-men Apocalypse. It take awhile to get going but once it does it never lets go, the movie is just as cheesy as the original but it was entertaining. The acting is not the best nor the story, but it was fun and exciting. A breath of fresh air compare to all this summer movies.",Independence Day - Resurgence

Super bad-ass aliens, who apparently are on war with the rest of the universe and as it seems they are winning, they loose now for a second time..

Also starring: a samurai-Rambo-warlord and his companion in battle a government accountant. A male scientist and a female one, that no one understands their part in the plot,kiss each other at the end.

651,alison_hawkins,The most fun I've ever had hating on a movie,5,4 July 2016,"It's been 20 years since the events that occurred in 1996, some people (including Former President Whitmore) are having odd dream visions about a circle, the lights have suddenly switched on in a crashed alien ship, and oddly, the Death Star is approaching the moon, where Liam Hemsworth and co have just avoided a mechanical disaster in a heroic scene not dissimilar to Captain America holding down a helicopter with his bare hands. Government are tougher this time, and order an attack on this intruding, spherical ship, which proves successful.At this point, I'm calling a spoiler alert. There's no way that we can try and seriously review this movie...all we can try and do is make sense of what actually happened.I re-watched the original Independence Day the night before seeing this, and I genuinely didn't remember it being so cheesy, and SO LONG. Although in the movie's defense, I realize now I watched the extended cut. Still, it was good fun, and I mean, Will Smith punches an alien in the face, so there's that.What I remember next is marveling at just how far technology seems to have advanced in just 20 years. Flying vehicles was one thing, and okay, maybe we got the technology plans from the alien ships in the 90's, but hold up. Did Liam Hemsworth just fly that ship-with- arms from the moon to earth to pick up Jeff Goldblum, and then take him back to the moon in about 20 minutes? I'm no astronaut but doesn't it take a couple of days at least for a one way trip?So, most of the original cast is back (which I gotta admit, is pretty darn cool) apart from Will Smith, because of the salary he demanded. I guess the team took it to heart and decided to kill Earth's best pilot in a test flight...which is kind of a lame way to go. Instead we get Jesse T. Usher, playing his Son, giving us the ultimate bro combo. Or not. Because Hemsworth tried to kill him. Not cool. Also not cool? Getting punched in the face in the middle of a cafeteria whilst your buddy steals your Moon Milk.After this I kind of just zoned out and had a bit of fun noticing all of the iconic scenes from the original which were basically copied for the sake of nostalgia. Morale boosting speech? Check. Alien choke slam into a foggy window? Check. The President deciding 'f this' and getting into a jet to save the day? Check. And then Liam Hemsworth punched an alien in the face and I lost it. I didn't even see what happened next, I was crying.Then of course we have the final scene, Earth's last ditch attempt at saving itself from extinction, which of course fails, because inside that Queen ship is an alien the size of a skyscraper, inside another alien body, with it's own shield. Oh snap. Fear not, the boys are here to save the day, whilst the two Levinson's are navigating a school bus full of kids around the alien's legs and HOLD UP. Was that a Jurassic Park reference in the side mirror right there?!You've at least got to give the movie points for the visuals though, because they were pretty amazing. I'd like to know what this would have been like in IMAX, but I'm not sure I'll ever want to see it again. It's amazing how a movie like this can actually be quite boring in places. It falls just too far on the bad side to be classed as a 'so bad it's good' movie for me, which is a shame. My only regret is that Jenna and I saw this at the cinema, so had to mock it in whispers rather than just screaming at the TV and inadvertently throwing Chinese food around the living room.",Independence Day - Resurgence

Were they hoping that somehow you could encounter aliens for the first time...twice ? This is a pretty decent SF movie in its own right, which, even if it's related to the first one, has its own personality. Of course this movie could not be about the first encounter with aliens, since that already happened in the first one, so this one has a different story. Yes, it is not perfect, but it has quite a few interesting twists and I certainly didn't think it was boring. It is actually pretty decent. Acting was good, humor was pretty decent too, special effects were pretty nice.There are a lot of actors from the first movie, all having important roles in this one, which I really liked.

655,uranassbandit,IMDb needs to seriously review it submission criteria,5,8 December 2016,"I rarely can be bothered to leave a review after a movie, but I'm driven too again, not by my disappointment in the actual film, but yet again by the incredible disappointment in the majority of reviews left here. IMDb sinks further into a pit of useless reviews that need to be navigated successfully to find anything helpful about a film. Brigaders and astoturfers abound and they are not purged from the system. There's a suspicious amount of 1 star-single reviewers for this film.So how was it? It's entertaining enough, the cgi is fantastic (I expect only teenagers think it isn't), the action is thick and fast at the expense of dialogue, the plot points can be seen coming from a mile away, the good guys win and the bad guys lose after numerous explosions, gunfights and aerial battles. It's damn near a reboot of the first film updated to 2016, so if Star Wars 7 gets a pass from amateur critics than so should this. The lead actress was wooden and out of place, the leading guy was fine, they brought back plenty of nostalgia actors to satisfy the member berries type of movie goer. They signaled their virtue with numerous punch-in-the-face obvious nods to ""how diverse"" the cast is and how their futuristic world has become a leftwing globalist utopia.No, it's not the worst film you've ever seen (that would mean its up with Troll 2, Howard The Duck, Plan 9 From Outer Space and such)No, its not the worst sci-fi flick of all time (that would mean it rivals Battlefield Earth or Pluto Nash)If you seriously think this movie was on those levels than you are; a) a paid astroturfer working for a rival company, b) 16 years old with no major life experience, or c) an online attention seeker, aka amateur critic, who loves to rip things down in order to build yourself up.This film is clearly dumbed down and badly edited. I would assume that an extended edition exists with more sense to it. BUT, most North American and Euro critics here are sadly missing who the designated target audience was, i.e. not just them exclusively. This was a film designed to succeed in the North Asian markets (especially China) in addition to the conventional markets. Did you miss the inclusion of a major young Hong Kong starlet Angela Yeung as one of the central characters? Having seen her already in several recent Chinese blockbusters like Mojin, Young Detective Dee, Rise of the Legend, etc, her casting was an obvious drawcard for the Chinese. Do people from Europe and North America even watch Asian cinema??? Because if you did, you would realize that thoughtful philosophical pieces don't necessarily bank it at the box office like they do in your country. Take a look at their most successful movies.North Americans better get use to the fact that Hollywood will continue its attempts to broaden its appeal to outside target audiences, possibly at the expense of the locals. You may want better dialogue, less plot holes, fewer explosions and better character development in 2016 but Hollywood only wants to sell tickets. Warcraft, Transformers 4 and this movie are just the tip of the iceberg. North Asian box office sales are increasingly vital to the American movie industry and as such you will continue to get more dumbed down movies like Pacific Rim and Jupiter Ascending. For the life of me, I don't understand why Pacific Rim gets a pass and this one doesn't, it was far more insulting to the intellect of the movie goer.P.S. at the end of the day this film can hardly be considered a flop, it made $100 million in the USA, $100 million worldwide and $110 million in China/Japan/Korea, hardly the $1B success they hoped for but hardly a catastrophe such as the Top 100 box office bombs of all time.P.P.S. I'm the last person who would self-describe as an apologist for the tax-dodging, money-shifting corporate enterprises such as production companies. I think the critics of this movie just need to realize their brigade of 1 star reviews speak more about their intelligence and agendas, than of the content of this film.",Independence Day - Resurgence
656,quarantadue,Better than the first one,7,1 October 2016,"This is an action movie, so, if you want to listen to long and smart dialogues, and see elaborate characters, you should change category.But between the category of action movies I would say it's not bad. It has all the quality big Hollywood productions usually have: good directing, good or at least acceptable acting, and good special effects.But it lacks one of the defect most action movies have: long boring sequences, like 10 minutes long car chase or endless bare hands fight on top of some running vehicle.Dramatic scenes are quite disappointing (watch some Asian movie if you want that) but fortunately are very short.The story has a good rhythm and most of it make sense.When I say that this is better than the first one, I mean it contextualized. When Independence Day came out in 1996 it looked really a dumb film compared to other film made in that years. But today we got used to film with really no plot and no characters, so this one is still better than average.So if you are tired after a long day of intellectual work, and just want to relax watching some action, good heroes that try to save the world, explosions, aliens and big spaceships, this is a good movie.You can even enjoy it watching it in a language you do not fully understand, like I did.",Independence Day - Resurgence

Not a single part of this film made sense. We were all confused watching it asking each other what was going on??? The actors tried, poor things, to show emotion. It wasn't enough to save the pure JUNK writing. Like, what were the writers smoking when they wrote this sequel? No, were they even AWAKE?

No character development and no logic for most part !5 starts are purely for the special effects which are world class but then that's it, that is all I carried when I walked out of the theater. I didn't care for any characters, didn't see any logic in the script (which I don't think even existed) and felt so cheated.It had such a potential but the story and writing was a total let- down.Even a 5 year old could have told a better story of an Alien invasion.It's a endless stitch of trailers, nothing more.",Independence Day - Resurgence

The acting alone is nothing short of grotesque. I was excited all over nothing. Based on what I saw, the original should have been left alone. The major pet peeve I have with this movie is the acting. At first I thought it was just a couple of cheesy lines, until the acting continued to be bad in scene after scene after scene. The poor acting just never stopped, no matter how much I was anticipating an end to it. It was almost as if they were deliberately trying to sabotage the film. So painful to watch. It is a real shame too because if I listened to it muted, it probably would have been a relatively good movie. They could have done so much better. If I were Jeff Goldblum or Bill Pullman, I would be ashamed. I now know why Will Smith truly turned the movie down. Bottom line: I was so disappointed. When I first caught wind of an ID4 sequel, I had high hopes, which crashed and burned immediately upon watching (no pun intended). If you haven't watched it yet either don't or watch it muted.

There is a lot of cool tech on display and I remarked to my gf in the theatre at one point, how impressed I was by the creativity of the film crew in coming up with so much cool looking alien tech.In summary f you a) like the concept - same concept as the first film. b) are not a criticism driven movie nerd, rather you just enjoy life and like to be entertained, taken out of reality for a few hours, you'll have a great time.This movie opens up opportunities for a 3rd film, which I think could be the best film of the series, so if you, like me want to see more of this, pay to go see the film, so the can green light the next installment.",Independence Day - Resurgence

It is just a car crash. It flails around trying to do something different to the original movie, but the only idea that anyone seemed to have was to make things bigger.None of the many, many story lines ever manages to get traction, much as none of the many, many paper thin 90210 characters ever manages to generate the slightest shred of empathy.

665,joerebk,Very Disappointing,2,25 June 2016,"Star Trek + Top Gun + Aliens + Back to the Future + AI = this mess. Yes all of these movies might be good on their own. However, if you take them all and mash them all together it is kind of like taking a bunch of ingredients in your kitchen and putting it in the blender and hope it works. Spoiler alert...it doesn't. I now have more respect for Will Smith for not reprising his role in this movie. Clearly he read the script and said thanks, but no thanks. The only redeeming feature is that it does have some cool explosions to break up the cheesy one liners and bad acting.The end sets it up for a sequel and our only hope is that the real aliens come to earth and wipe us all out before that comes to fruition.",Independence Day - Resurgence
666,stefanborke,"Twenty years, and they couldn't come up with a better plot...",2,30 October 2016,"Okay, so aliens are all taken care of, and we set about plundering their ship, finding awesome technology which is then incorporated into the defense of the earth in anticipation for the next wave of aliens. What is the first thing you would want to explore, from a tactical standpoint? Obviously, according to the film, BLASTERS. Let's make CANNONS and mount them on the MOON. It's like no one in the second movie watched the first movie. The whole main reason the aliens were unstoppable was because of their advanced shielding. They were able to protect not only the mother ship, but also each individual fighter ship, which meant no matter what you threw at them, it only vaporized in the energy shield. And yet no one in twenty years thought, ""Hey, maybe we should work on getting the shields working at peak performance, THEN work on offense from the safety of an energy field that protects everything inside."" Twenty. Years. That's twenty years of ""unprecedented cooperation"" throughout the world, when all the nations of the world were committed to working together to plan for the next attack. You have the world's best minds working to help protect the planet, and all they can come up with are moon lasers, better fighter jets, and fancy jumbotron monitors. That honestly detracted a lot from the crappy acting. Maybe people could have focused a little less on green screen and worked on making a plot that makes me actually care about the humans surviving, because as-is, the only thing I got out of it is that humans are arrogant dweebs that constantly are shooting themselves in the foot, and yet somehow they get lucky and the shot ricochets and takes out all the enemies. By the end, the one dude says, ""Not so primitive, now, eh?"" And I thought, Yes, actually; unbelievably primitive. Like you were given fire, but you are still eating raw meat and getting poisoned because you only think of it as something pretty to watch at night. If it seems like I'm harping on this one major plot point, think of it like this: If humans had harnessed the power of the shields, even just to shield the moon cannons, the fighter jets, and/or the orbital cannons, the entire outcome of the movie would have been different. Think about that every time a stationary gun is taken out with one shot, because it is totally and completely unprotected. I object to the characters being intentionally written stupid because of lazy writing. There is plenty of potential in this world they have made to create something interesting, but no. Let's keep aliens prisoner. Let's keep HUNDREDS of them prisoner, in the same place that we're doing all the important research. Let's try to do exactly what we did in the first movie with trying to bomb them, only this time let's fly inside their unsuspiciously unshielded entryway into the main ship. Let's provide the shields that we do use, once in the entire movie, with just enough power to contain the blast, but then have them shut down right after. Let's put some slapdash character profiles together with some weakly-defined backstories that are so marginal that it's almost an afterthought. I tried to like this movie, but it really makes that hard. It's almost like it actively doesn't want you to like it, and there's not even enough one-liners for it to make it as some crappy pulp. It's just a bunch of recycled garbage full of clichés. Save the dog. Reckless hero saves the day through recklessness. Hopeless nerd becomes a hero, and his hero compliments him, grudgingly.

Was no time to get to know the new characters, and many scenes lack buildup and setup, it's just fell flat. Its like the editors just lost a shipment of footage, and had to use what was left.

672,kevrookes,ID4 2: Resurgence,4,19 July 2016,"Boring. That is the one word I can use to sum up this movie. It was everything that I expected it would be; unoriginal and full of typical plot clichés with some cheesy one-liners. Cue aliens attacking Earth, (allegedly, even though you only really see one Asian city being destroyed and then part of the Pacific ocean), relatives of main characters tragically dying and then said main characters seeming to totally forget said relative died, the now ex-president giving another rousing speech about 'freedom' and then a very rushed ending with an alien queen who's CGI effects look like they were from 1996. To top it all off, the cheesy ending opened the doorway to more sequels so the name of the fantastic original can be tarnished even more in the years to come. It's such a shame as this film had a lot of potential but it all just seemed very rushed and slapped together in parts. Part of what made the original film so great were the totally awesome city devastation scenes - buildings blowing up and whole cities burning - there was a total lack of such amazing effects and jaw-dropping scenes in this sequel and it was disappointing. The idea that the aliens new ship had a gravitational pull and could root whole cities up from it's foundations high into the air and then drop it back down to Earth in a fiery blaze of gigantic doom and destruction was a great one but they didn't use it as effectively or as much as they could've done. For me, this film is really nothing new and I actually got very very bored of watching it from about 50mins onwards as it was as predictable as the sunrise. Big shame but worth a watch if there's nothing else on.",Independence Day - Resurgence
673,machine-48993,20 years waiting for this?,5,11 August 2016,"20 years waiting for this?The first independence day was not perfect but it was a good popcorn blockbuster that featured great special effects and tons of destruction plus some likable characters and Will Smith. This one seemed to take everything away.So the plot is after 20 years the aliens come back to wreak more havoc on Earth blab blah blah stuff gets destroyed and so on. It felt just like the same movie only instead of focusing on the characters in the beginning it introduces a bunch of characters who are never really developed or are annoying. Liam Hemsworth is no Will Smith either. He lacked the charisma and coolness and was boring. The destruction was glanced over and did not have the same emotional impact as the first movie. Plus the entire thing was way to predictable. It felt by the numbers like they were checking a list. Like Step 1. Destroy things. Step 2 Retaliate. Etc. On top of that there were characters that had no purpose in the movie and could have been cut. Charlotte Gainsbourg's role as Catherine Marceaux served no real purpose and when the movie was about over I was like. ""Oh yeah she is in this movie.who is she again."" Plus Judd Hirsch's character Julius Levinson added nothing but a few comic relief moments and some positive hope but added nothing to the plot and felt like filler. Not only that there were tons of plot holes in the movie and stupid choices by the characters that just bugged me. Plus after a summer of movies with tons of destruction like Captain America Civil war and seeing Independence Day a week after watching the new X-Men the graphics and destruction was not as good and at times just down right dumb. Despite all of the negatives there were some decent scenes. The Warlord Dikembe Umbutu actually was pretty likable and some character development despite not really needing to be in the film. And you got a better look at the aliens this time. Plus some of the battles were nice and Bill Pullman was pretty good. Overall I do not hate the movie but the movies is disappointing. After 20 years they could have come up with something better. This is like the Duke Nukem Forever of movies. Took forever to make and came out disappointing.

I can only recall that at the end walking out I felt (once again) a big disappointment. I had the impression that Jeff Goldblum felt ashamed when shooting the film. To be fair: the first part also contained many stereotype characters. The super brave pilot that protects his family. The mad scientist. The super tough general. The charismatic US president.... but it was carried by the good acting skills of Jeff Goldblum and Will Smith. In this sequence the same characters are being reused. But there simply isn't any good acting. The actors are disconnected feeling that their job is just to fill the void between action scenes. The action scenes are done OK.

The acting is fair, but it is hard to feel anything for these people who are clearly not in danger and mimicking being scared in some special effects set in Hollywood. I think that's the issue, the effects are too removed from reality that it is hard to emote or empathize. The whole picture is over-produced, lacking in humor and over-Americanized.

Movie Rating: 5.0/10 Soundtrack Rating: 2.0/10Movie Review: I was very much looking forward to seeing Independence Day: Resurgence. Let's just say, I feel like going home right now and watching the original Independence Day to regain my love for the original movie and ""Independence Day Franchise."" I did not really like Resurgence. I was lost in the effects and a similar storyline to the first film, but it wasn't nearly as good. This movie was kind of like seeing Star Wars: The Force Awakens, as far as a similar storyline to the original movie(s) goes. However, The Force Awakens, literally awoke the spirit in my love for Star Wars. Independence Day simply did not awake many things in me at all. In fact, I felt like falling asleep.The highlight of the film was seeing the similar faces in many characters from the first film – though none of them had a stellar performance. Perhaps the mad scientist (Brent Spiner), that had been in a comma for 20 years and awoke with the alien spaceships re-appearing, had the most amusing performance of the actors. Jeff Goldblum was fun to see, as was his father, played again by Judd Hirsch, but their roles were not nearly as enduring as the first film. Other familiar faces were fun to see, however, none of them sparked what they did 20 years ago. See the film in theatres but no rush. Go to the drive-in, and enjoy the experience of the drive-in. Take in the film, but don't expect much. No need to see the film in IMAX or 3D. It was not shot on either camera, but tweaked in post, and not overly impressive. Soundtrack Review: There was nothing good about the soundtrack. The original score was mediocre at best. What was the composer's name again? Nothing original to the ear.

More so than the first film but this was a terrible, terrible film. The first film had a story line that was just pathetic. A vastly intelligent life form attacking our planet and we manage to upload a virus (no doubt using a USB key or floppy I presume) to the mother ship and manage to save the planet yet again and kill all alien life forms attacking us... or did we. In Resurgence you get an equally lame ending (I won't spoil it for those that have still not seen the film) but it seems the writers can not seem to come up with a really intelligent way to kill these superior beings, even 20 years later when they are even more intelligent about man's weaknesses and you know we stand no chance whatsoever so throughout the film you are thinking, how on earth is man going to do it. Believe me, it is not worth the wait. Don't get me wrong. I'm not the sort of person that focuses a great deal on the story line when it comes to major block busters that put emphasis on the special effects. However, I left the cinema feeling cheated and paid £14 for 2 hours of a pathetic story line, combined with not so good acting and average quality special effects.

I had reviewed the ratings before going, so I didn't have high hopes in the first place. But the movie set a new low for my expectations. Everything is bad about the movie except the graphics. The acting is pathetic, dialogues horrible, story line is non existential and physics - Newton would have committed suicide. It defies logic in all possible ways. Aliens queen running around and fighting while her protective squad is just standing and watching. Getting agitated and running after a school bus. An alien species which has mastered space travel fighting like street dogs.I recommend not watching this even if someone gives you a free ticket and pays you an extra twenty just for watching it.",Independence Day - Resurgence

Too bad the portrait can't talk. This movie has some decent acting and good CGI effects. One can guess the plot from the trailers. And it's nice seeing some of the same characters from the first movie which tries to give continuity to the film but it doesn't work for all of them. The problem with this film, (in my humble opinion), is that Independence Day 2 is missing the humor and heart that Will Smith brought to the first Independence Day. I understand that he did not do the movie because the powers that be did not want to cast his son in a lead role. Well, the movie is worse for his absence. It's just OK.",Independence Day - Resurgence

My first issue with this movie is when the huge enemy-alien spacecraft appears and they fire at it with their trillion dollar weapon and they figure out that the thing has shields. They knew this from the first movie ergo they had known it for 20 years but they still have not put any effort in to figuring out how to disable the shields? I mean they did have alien technology that has been implemented in to everyday use for 20 years! Then we have cheesy lines, same gags and things that happened in the first movie and this is only the tip of the iceberg! Because what do you know, the aliens are defeated the SAME WAY as they where in the first movie. One crazy old man flies a bomb in to the alien spacecraft and blows himself up together with the spacecraft. What do you think? Sequel, Reboot or Remake?",Independence Day - Resurgence
701,fujijord,Fell short.,4,24 June 2016,"I enjoyed the first film, because I expected it be a fun Alien movie. Acting wasn't bad, not a horrible script, (but not a great either. Come on, it's a sci-fi, defend your planet Alien movie). I knew the kind of movie I was walking into. Grab popcorn, soda and twizzlers, hand over your bi-weekly paycheck to the concession worker, leave your brain at the door and enjoy the special effects that flood across the screen, and have the sound blow your face off. But..... I felt it failed to even do that. The visuals where great and professional. I really wanted to enjoy this film and a fun ride but couldn't. When I left, I felt I waste two hours of my life. I was excited for this one, better Special Effects, thy brought back Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman added Liam Hemsworth whom I respect as actors. Roland Emmerich had a handful of talent to work with but unfortunately the acting talent could only go as far the quality of the script. I felt the script was often anti- climatic during a few parts. The dialogue was awkward at a parts, like suggusting to make out with someone at the end and delivered more awkwardly with bad editing. It surprised me to see how many people worked on this script, which turned out horrible. Look on the writing section. There are five people who worked on the script . Who knows how many re-writes and they couldn't come up with something with a little more substance? Just once in these Alien invasion movies, I would like at least one character who isn't a cardboard cut out. (maybe I'm wrong, and there is one but I can't remember. ) But I guess I can't asks for too much in these type of sci-fi movies. I felt the editing was horrible. I feel the editing ruined what could have been and exciting or nice moments, into an anti-climatic scene. SPOILER*********The only good part for me is when the President and her crew get's taken out. Let me explain. It's not because the President's a woman, or unpatriotic, I live in the states and love it. It's because I felt the movie portrayal of politicians was impulsive and somewhat idiotic. Which, I think, is the only believable and realistic part of the script that made any sense.Well anyways, if you go see, try your best to enjoy it. I tried.",Independence Day - Resurgence

In saying that Independence day resurgence is what i would call a made for the typical American audience type of movie, full of yehah's and let's save the world (again) then fill the dialogue with cheesy one liners. It is what it is a sequel of the first movie with many of the same actors returning and giving the same rousing yehahs and cheesy one liners, as for the Cgi it is average, the story is self explanatory but it does go on a bit trying to explain the obvious.

Sadly this time he is not going to get much purchase on it. One thing he forgot in the original was to reward the heroes that saved the world, so he chose the perfect occasion to do so, brought his original cast and made them applaud for the heroism. But he forgot to bring Will Smith to the drawing board who was the standout performer and hence the missing link in this resurgence episode. The story-line is revenge on the part of the aliens who came back with more venom and wreaked havoc again and once again were tamed owing to some hit and trial methods this time. An overdose of special effects has always been Roland's strength and he did not disappointed this time either. Perhaps a lot more emphasis was required for the story development. The cast is as adolescent as their performance. Jeff Goldblum being the only noticeable performer.

I'm not even sure if there even is a storyline to this movie.The worst part, aside from all the crying scenes based upon long distance relationships, unresolved father issues and what not, was in fact that the aliens are more primitive than us.You would think that a race with such insane technology have evolved beyond petty and shortsighted impulse driven emotions. It's when you realize that the Queen of the aliens suddenly gets a personal vendetta against a yellow school bus while fighter planes are bombarding her, that the manuscript was written in half an hour in a coffee shop.I really went into this with open eyes and was completely set for loving it, but no.

Characters are shallow, plot is cliché, major characters from the original movie don't add anything to the story, David's dad....seems like a creepy old loner, Capt Hiller....i wouldn't give 2 shits if an alien ate him....only 2 characters that stand out somewhat are Goldblum and Hemmsworth. {ts a mess, really, Petronas towers and Burj Khalifa falling on London....jeez, spaceship scraping the moon, really?

I really liked the original. Even today, when I catch it on A&E, AMC or another channel I'm tempted to watch it. I think it's one of those movies that stands the test of time. In a lot of ways, it's one of the best summer block buster movies of all time.Very rarely is the sequel as good as the original, and this is no exception to that rule. However, it's not bad. It just lacks the allure and tension the other original brought to the screen. Of course, the special effects are outstanding and there are some scenes that rival the original.Everyone knows Will Smith is missing from this film. He undoubtedly carried the first one. However, almost everyone else is back except for Randy Quaid who has lost his marbles and the last time he was in the news... his life went to the shitter.The Return characters of Jeff Goldblum and Bill Pullman do a lot to save this movie from the new cast. Simply put, they suck. There is so little character development to them it almost felt like Starship Troopers at times. While Starship Troopers was intentionally goofy and fed into the mindset... ""we aren't even going to try and do some acting or character development"" this young cast is just awkward and uncool.The story line is good and it flows pretty well from the original. However, the movie's transitions are pretty poor. At one moment the director tries to make for you feel an emotional attachment to certain characters, and in the blink of an eye you are onto your next battle scene. So, why the story flows and makes sense... there is very little rhythm and attachment to any character in the film. In many ways, it is very thrown together from the editing crew.There are some really good redeeming qualities to the film though... it's relation to the original is good. The cinematography and visual effects are damn good. It's definitely worthy of seeing on the big screen, but only once... I don't think you'll be buying it for Christmas to watch over and over again.That being said, it hints at another sequel and maybe the 3rd time will bring back some of the charm the original had.",Independence Day - Resurgence

Needless to say, I was incredibly hyped about the sequel.This was the first movie that I ever wanted to walk out on about halfway into the movie. The whole thing is such a rip off of the original, that it's incredibly cringeworthy. The dialogue is laughable and there are a bunch of characters that no one cares about. To be honest, I couldn't even understand the whole story. It was so messed up and they kept trying to re-create scenes from the original movie like those epic speeches(every one of them failed) and trying to fly out of closing enclosures, aliens speaking from a human etc.. Can someone tell what the whole point of the school bus story was?

Hypotetically this could be true, but not in our world. This will never happen, we know it, and this adds to the shallowness of the movie.

You want to lose yourself in some fantasy Sci-Fi that pushes the elements of reality to the boundaries and often beyond... Then watch Hollywood!The baseline of the film is good, the story line works, the acting isn't the best, but still works. In my opinion, grab a soft drink and bag of Popcorn, sit back and enjoy.

Again why do they insist on taking these films, and lack the imagination or the guts to take a bold new leap.Why try and effectively copy large parts of the original, but yet seem to make them less enjoyable or even worse. Yes we could all say these films were classics in their day, maybe they should be left alone, but this shouldn't be the attitude we adopt. We should bring sequels out to keep a franchise going if a film deserves that treatment, but at least make and effort to make this a new, bold, better film. It's as though these film producers are scared to take a leap, news flash it may fall down but people like someone who tries to be the best they can be and this could apply to films in the same way.In most sequels I've seen lately I feel like this has been nothing short of robbery, that their laziness and inability to produce something fresh has meant they just want to make some good money and run off laughing at our gullibility.As I said overall it was OK to watch, but the plot was so similar it was almost cringe worthy. If you have nothing better to do, why not watch it, but I'd rather pop in the DVD and watch the original. It was hard to tell which was the older / better film apart from the occasional CGI.I just hope these film sequels do become better, the bar at this current time is so low it's laughable,Please for the love of God don't do the same to the Goonies if a sequel should follow.",Independence Day - Resurgence

Is everyone in super mothership sleeping? no reinforcements? Horrible presentation: They said the world was completely united and developed global defensive. Sorry, I just saw a few people fighting Aliens. In ID4, at least we saw what the rest of the worlds were doing their jobs shooting down giant saucers, in IDR, sorry, I just saw few American fighters (Yeah I know they now called ESD, but the warfield is just too contained in America), shouldn't the air battle be world wide? come on! there is a continent-sized mothership landing there!The world is coming to destruction and not one character showed they worried about it, at least they acted that way.No tension: It's just like watching 2012, destructive scenes just pass by, no one feels sad, no despair, no hope, no surprises, just stupidity and unfunny jokes.

The original Independence Day is one of my favorite movies. It is a cult classic which this is not, this is more typical of a sci-fi action movie.

This movie has very cheesy dialogue, especially the attempted comedic relief which is the actual bit that makes you feel nervous and not the on screen drama ensuing. It also uses every cliché in the genre, it was quite fascinating to see them not miss a single one.As I was saying though, this movie is indeed bad but not as low as some people rate is simply because they went in with too much expectation. In my personal opinion an IMDb rating of 5 is at the level of ""not great but not terrible either"".If you still like alien invasion movies, space themed discovery and just GFX marvels that cost more than the actors combined go ahead and give it a go, if you want a compelling story with strong characters this will just make you mad.",Independence Day - Resurgence

726,lchest1-68-155354,Disappointed,1,11 January 2017,"I have noticed an epidemic hitting Hollywood. You know that saying ""Too much of a good thing?"" That's exactly what's going on in the movie industry. Where the focus is mostly on the WOW factor of special effects. Though special effects is the blood of a movie (no pun intended) it isn't the heart of a film. The heart of a film is the story line, dialogue, characters, movie scores, and the build up in the film that makes it stand out from the rest. That is how you take a script and turn it into a masterpiece film! This was the focus of Hollywoods in the past, but it has been lost over the years through the ever growing CGI demand in film. A little bit of CGI is great and easier for the creators. But when you start ignoring the true value of a movie, that's when you start getting ratings like mine and others. As soon as I turned the movie on and heard the opening score I was worried. Music plays a BIG part in a motion picture. It gives the audience the emotional feelings of the characters and movie. Helping the audience connect with each scene. For example John Williams opening credits score for Star Wars. It helped to make the film popular. It was a strong and grand opening for the film and prepared a platform for an amazing movie. That was NOT presented in this film. In the first film the music was strong, patriotic, and you knew you were about to experience a piece of movie history. I was 14 when I say Independence Day in the theater and it was an awesome experience! David Arnold did a great job on the music, but on this movie it was missing the emotion from the first film. Independence Day had humor, strength, and action that kept you on the edge of your seats. I just didn't find that in this film expect from actor Judd Hirsch who still seemed to have his character intact from the last film. Otherwise I just felt like the acting was OK. The new characters didn't seem to relate at all to the last movie and the existing actors seemed as though they didn't want to be there. They were lacking the emotions they expressed in the first film. It was kinda sad to see and was disappointing. Now the movie takes place 20 years later in the year 2016. My boyfriend and I were a little thrown off by the technology that was presented in the film. It wasn't relatable to today's technology and wasn't ever really explained. Where did this technology come from? Did we learn it from the aliens? If we had an explanation maybe it would have made more sense. I think it would have been smarter to have based the movie in the real 2016. My generation would have been more excited and the new generation would have loved it as well. Going big doesn't always mean better. The aliens came into the movie to fast, the story line was everywhere, yet not there at all, and I couldn't relate with the characters. I laughed, but not because it was funny. I laughed because it was lazy. It was lazily executed and was suppose to WOW us more, then enlighten us. This movie could have been much better. Maybe even better then the first.",Independence Day - Resurgence

The tone of the movie, the lightning, the soundtrack, the plot, they're all different. This feels more like a sequel to 2012 than to ID. There's no charisma, heart, soul or magic in this one. I'm a fan of ID and I left the theater heart broken. The plot is confusing, a lot of things happen at the same time. There's no rhythm and the movie can be boring some times. There's no time for you to appreciate the apocalyptic scenes because everything happens really fast. The score is the most uninspiring score I've heard in years.

728,graverobbing_zombie,Independence Day: Regurgitate,3,23 June 2016,"Independence Day was one of my favourite movies growing up, so I admit I was somewhat excited for this when it was first announced. Goldblum was on board, so was Pullman, Hirsch, Spiner (he survived?? OK...) and Emmerich was directing again. It sounded like a nostalgia trip for people like me who grew up with the movie. No Will Smith, but you can't have everything, right? The first trailer came out a few months ago and I was a little less excited. So I lowered my expectations and still planned on going to see it. Maybe it would still bring back some of that childhood excitement I had when I saw the first one for the very first time, because let's face it, you don't go into a movie like this expecting Schindler's List. Well, ID: Resurgence proves that sometimes you gotta be careful what you wish for. It plunges the depths of just how dumb, incoherent, and downright insulting to your intelligence a big blockbuster can get. The CG destruction is so bland and the majority of the acting and dialogue so forced and trite that by the end, I almost felt like I hadn't really watched anything at all. I wanted to walk out halfway through. I wonder how much they gave Jeff Goldblum to cajole him into this garbage. (2 points for Goldblum & Hirsch, and the alien queen at the end was admittedly pretty cool)",Independence Day - Resurgence
729,slatteew-120-652838,"Great Expansion upon the Mythos, albeit with some fumbling around",8,28 June 2016,"Obligatory: I love Independence Day (1996). I'll break my review down by Visuals/Graphics, Sound, Plot, Cohesion, Expansion (since it's a sequel or continuation of the story) and extras.Visuals/Graphics: A film is largely a visual experience (mixed with audio/music of course). This film used both practical models and CGI. Many of the really heavy CGI scenes don't last very long to be overly taxing, like the destroying of Singapore all the way to Britain. The lifting of people off the ground was in itself a little frightening (i wish they spent a little more than a couple seconds on it), losing all control and floating in the air due to gravity between the alien spaceship and the Earth. The visual effects in this movie are top notch!!Sound: There is a dismal lack of sound/music in this film. I stayed for the full credits and saw (if i recall correctly) only 5 scores........compare this to ID4 (1996) which had a fair amount of music to augment the visual experience. There were scenes in the movie that did have some cautious or trembling music to augment the feeling in the scene, but it was used a heck of a lot better in the 1996 movie.Plot: Pretty much spelled out in all the trailers, but David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) heads the Earth Space Defense Force who are preparing us for an invasion at some point. It's not found until recently in the movie that the aliens found out about the Earth repelling their first invasion. The aliens that got the distress call then set a course for Earth to wipe them out, however with 1 caveat. They introduce a concept of the aliens needing our molten core and were tunneling in Africa and no place else to get it last time. Strange, and kinda unnecessary for the old ship to tunnel when we could have just had this specific alien ship need it instead of trying to connect the two in such a ""cut and paste"" connecting way. It also felt a little quick cut in places where there might have been some other lines of dialogue between people setting up lines, but then were cut for unknown reasons. However, i do like the plot setup of other aliens and a galactic uprising against the aliens that have been attacking Earth. That part was well paced and added greatly to the story. More on this in Expansion.Cohesion: We have two types of cohesion to talk about, cohesion within itself, and cohesion with the other movie it's built upon. There is a good amount of cohesion in the movie. When we change locations, i know pretty well where we are due to who know knew was going to or was at certain locations. Only 1 i don't really recall was the Female President's location when the aliens invaded and killed her and others. There are sometimes it cuts away from scenes too quickly i feel, like there were supposed to be other things there but they cut them out that could flesh everything out (hopefully) more clearly. Cohesion with the previous movie is more or less covered in my ""Plot"" section.Expansion: I feel this movie is sort of filler with a lead up to the next movie. I say that because a good chunk of the movie is dedicated to finding out about this other alien craft we shot down and captured, have some people who can read the alien language, and figure out that it is something the aliens fear. 1 of them appears just before the aliens attack, they consult the consequences of attacking or not attacking, and decide to attack it. Then..........everything hits the fan and the aliens show up. We have two stories of trying to repel the aliens again, and another of figuring out what this other alien object is and what we can learn from it. The expansion has been much better than most of the reboots we've seen, Force Awakens is the worst offender of practically NO expansion of the universe (unless you want to argue the movie universe, but everything in the movie was already in the Expanded universe in some way).Extras: I don't get a lot of the hate this movie has been receiving. A lot of the complaints people have about this movie i had about other big movies like every Marvel movie, Force Awakens, and others. Sure there are some inconsistencies such as the mass of the 3,000 mile ship landing on the Earth would change our orbit and rotation velocities considerably. I'll give a pass to the tides and such with the aliens ability to control gravitational output, although I don't know why they would keep it the same. The humor in the movie is good, not as good or flowing as the first, but it hits well. 1 thing i really liked about the movie was it wasn't afraid to kill it's characters or harm them, physically or emotionally. All the superhero movies are terrible offenders of this. They all seem like it's just a ""game"" on a VR headset where they act all happy go lucky and there's no consequences or harm that will come to anyone ever. Heck, this movie killed off 3 main characters!I know i'm a little all over the place with this review, but I enjoyed what i saw, and would have enjoyed it more if it didn't have a few of those inconsistencies/unnecessary tie in, and if the music was better used to heighten tension/suspense or celebration in areas that needed it.",Independence Day - Resurgence

I expected a movie about aliens vs humans and that's what I got.I wanted a nights of entertainment, with awesome special effects that were more innovative and more spectacular then the first one and that's what i got.It's not possible to make a movie better then the movie from 1996. So what you see, is what you get. What I got was a continuation of the first movie, a new chapter, so to speak.I like the fact that we do get a bit more information about ""them"" if you can say that. I believe that I'm not the only one wondering where these aliens came from and what their story is, (yes i know it's just imagination in someones head and a Sci-Fi movie), All we know is that they were described as ""locusts"" traveling from planet to planet. In this movie we get a lot more background information.I like the fact that many of the actors that were in the first movie, also are in this movie. The script is mediocre. The actors are ""okay"" in the movie, though sometimes I do think that the movie takes the ""we are so awesome"" part and the self glorification way to far.The special effects were very very good, as I expected.All in all I got a good nights of entertainment.",Independence Day - Resurgence
731,asigovitch,Disappointing Sequel,5,2 October 2017,"The trailer had me absolutely fooled. The excitement level for this movie was pretty high. They had talked about doing one for years and years and they finally got it off the ground. After watching it you are left wondering the real reason why Will Smith backed out. Now I can believed that he simply didn't like the way the story was going. Most of us understand that this film was to be completely out of reality but the first movie was in reason. This movie took a few extra steps than it needed to. What was cool about the first one was the mystery behind the alien nation that was attacking our world. This time around we learned more than we wanted to. I had myself going ""oh come on, really?"" at the screen at certain moments, and I would feel I wasn't the only one that had this kind of reaction. The other thing that was troubling was the pace of everything. The time-line progressed so quickly it was difficult to let everything that was going on settle in. They didn't dwell on the severity of everything and were just in the thick of it so quickly. I really hope there is not another sequel because the way it was left off, the war will no longer be on Earth, and will just make it another space war movie, which we already have enough of.",Independence Day - Resurgence

The line to get in was so long -- wrapped around the building. I left the movie feeling completely drained, that we just averted another alien invasion - whew! Fast forward 20 years -- ""RESURGENCE""! The excitement quickly ended 10 minutes into the movie :( All the cool CGI couldn't save this movie from the bad script, lack of development, and BORING new characters. I felt nothing for them.

So the queen has this shield that can withstand a nuclear like blast at point blank range, yet can easily be overcome by a far less powerful fighter's laser. Come on I.B. Bus scene. So where can I find a bus that can out perform a formula one race car. In this scene a queen alien chases this old school bus full of people, and despite how hard she tries, she can not catch this bus, even after jumping in front of the bus. Come on II.C. Boarding the alien mother ship. So these aliens have traveled multiple galaxies and interacted with many species including one that has tech equal to their own, yet they do not have the tech to monitor when one of their fighters have been high-jacked. Heck, this was done in the first movie and the alien still didn't learn from that. Come on III.D. Why are the aliens attacking earth? Why do they want our planets core? The plot of the movie was and is never fully developed. Why do they want earth? The only good point I can add is that the CG is pretty good.

734,ChanceTGardener,I Deeply Regret Having Viewed This,1,16 December 2016,"I thought it was a mess. It seemed to be a string of relatively random events and special effects scenes as well as a slew of undeveloped characters that I couldn't really tell apart from each other. The addition of international actors and ""themes"" seemed promising for the first few seconds, but they seemed to just be awkwardly and artificially inserted into the movie, I assume in order to appeal to international audiences, and did not seem to serve the plot in any meaningful way.I just couldn't resist giving it a try, because I liked the original, despite it's flaws. This was awful, and not in a good way. For me it had little entertainment value. I used a coupon to watch it for $1.00 on Google Play. Even with that coupon, I think I was overcharged (about 10 times what the movie was worth).I am writing this review as a penance, because if I can save just one potential viewer, maybe it will have all been worthwhile.",Independence Day - Resurgence

Alas it wasn't to be.The acting is really, really wooden. There's no charisma between the characters. The script is weak. The plot, even for Sci Fi, is absurd. It jumps between scenes so quickly that the film sections feel disconnected from each other and you don't really care what happens to anyone. The token comedy relief is embarrassing. David's relationship with his father seems to have completely dissolved. Where is Connie, his ex wife that he rejoined at the end of the first film?It's rubbish. You'll be bored of the same stuff over and over. Wait for it on Blue Ray.As for spoilers: the plot holes are enormous. I know not everyone will geek out, but a lot of us do. Here are some, they are spoilers so don't read them.How are the aliens around 10 feet tall yet the humans fit perfectly in their space ship cockpits? How does the Queen survive 4 fusion bombs to the face yet get taken down by small arms fire?How does the queen smash the trucks holding the shield up when she's on the other side of the shield?Why does the ship flying away not have the same ripping effects on gravity?Wait for the Blue Ray / DVD.",Independence Day - Resurgence

738,aarongrantham,"Their back, from outer space",4,24 June 2016,"Independence Day: Resurgences is the 2016 science fiction action film that is directed by Roland Emmerich and is the sequel to the 1996 film Independence Day . The film star Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman, Judd Hirsch, Vivica A.Fox and Brent Spiner all reprise their roles from the previous film, new cast members include Liam Hemsworth, Maika Monroe, Jessie Usher and William Fichtner.Twenty years have passed since the events of the previous film and the human race has enjoyed peace and has used the technology from the crashed alien ships for the Earth Space Defence to fend off any threats.But somewhere in South Africa David Levinson is lead to a ship that is still intact from the 1996 attack, the ship looks like it was attempting to drill into the earth's core when the mothership was destroyed. Once inside David discovers that a distress call was sent to the alien homeland and learns that another alien ship is heading for earth but also a different craft that could hold the key to preventing earth's destructionRoland Emmerich and Dean Devlin return as writers and director of the film and i have to say that I'm disappointed with the film. I believe that the 1996 film is a great film for its time and should have been left alone, the 1996 film didn't need a sequel to it and now after 20 years we get this film. The character development was poor, the CGI at the start of the film were a little shaky but improved in the main action sequences.The situations and problems that the characters faced were straightforward to solve and things seemed to go their way at the end. There were very little destruction sequences in the film, no tension in any scenes, no excitement in the film and the soundtrack was bland and just used most of the music from the first film.Will Smith didn't return for this film and his character is missed, he gave a very good performance in the first film with his character being full of humour but also seriousness. Liam Hemsworth does his best to fill the boots of Will Smith's character but doesn't come close.The ship maybe bigger this time but the film is a let down.For more reviews checkout https://filmorder.wordpress.com/",Independence Day - Resurgence

The special effects were top end. I gave it 4 stars at least (The DVD, sadly, left out some important parts, and did not have the theatrical version it advertised). The sequel failed on all points. The actors from the original were truly pathetic. Jeff Goldblum had none of his humor, charm and great acting ability. Bill Pullman had none of the quality of his original performance; I was embarrassed for him. Judd Hirsh was okay, but had only a bit part. The new actors for this sequel were little more than a clique, with little interest generated. The special efforts, even in 3D, were blurred and boring, with zero quality. The darkness of the screen in most scenes ruined what little effort they did make and the 3D was wasted, it added nothing. The original storyline was trashed, with no explanations to explain how the things we saw were occurring (I don't want to give out spoilers here). I'm shocked the same Directors were involved in this disaster of a film. I give it one star, and that's being generous. Don't waste your money and time on it.",Independence Day - Resurgence
741,mcguev,A strong contender for worst movie of the year,1,25 June 2016,"And also, one of the worst sequels ever to be made. The truth is, like some other films, Independence Day: Resurgence didn't have to be made. Why it was made, I can't tell. Perhaps 20th Century Fox needed a to resurrect this brand to compete with other studios. And as the ending makes sufficiently clearly, there's more coming (please, spare us from it!). There's truly nothing to be recommended here: the story is dumb, the script very poor (some lines or scenes are unintentionally laughable), every single joke falls flat, the characters are one dimensional, the performances from the veteran actors could have been phoned in, and those from the young ones are rather stiff and uninspiring. Relationships have no chemistry and one doesn't really care for anyone. Boring is a good word to describe what happens on screen at every turn. There's never any real tension built, nor there is ever a sense of urgency. And they make the mistake of merely making the threat merely bigger (absurdly so; then again, Star Wars has recently stumbled upon that same rock). The film boasts a democratic, all inclusive, multicultural, globalist vibe. It also features a very prominent same-sex relationship from a significant, albeit secondary, character. It may be a SJW dream of a movie, since every requisite box of social justice is checked. In this sense the movie turns out to be quite lofty. If it proves anything, it is this: than the inclusion of such topics, or their filmic depiction per se do not better a film. It may just have the opposite effect, since all felt rather tiresome and fabricated. The movie fails in every department: story, script, acting, soundtrack, editing. But also in special effects. Imagine that! One of the main draws of the original ID4 was, precisely, its SFX. This one also boasts special effects galore, but they aren't of very good quality. It looks like everyone is in front of a green screen all the time. Objects don't have weight to them and all the presentation feels very cartoony.

Acting is lame as it gets, only the cast from the first part did some real acting, young ones played soap-opera as its worst, even Starship Troopers had better acting. Music was somewhere there in the background but it had now influence on movie's action whatsoever. Special effect were first class. Movie's plot is as lame as it gets and offends sane people. Alien mother ship was so huge that in reality its entry into our atmosphere would burn out whole oxygen in minutes killing everything on this planet. What was the reason to harvest Earth's core? There are billions of planets with cores to be harvested, bigger, better, easier to access without risking a Queen to be wasted by armed monkeys. The best thing though, is an African warlord decoding Alien language muahhahaha:) In my humble opinion, decoding completely unknown, alien form of communication would take hundreds of years because there is no anchor point to compare it to anything we already understand.

749,iggy-51471,"Some special effects are cool, nothing else is.",4,24 June 2016,"In the sequel to the original science fiction disaster movie Independence Day a mix of the old cast (minus Will Smith) and some new get to take on another alien invasion, this time even more dangerous with even less time.Therein lays the first problem. The movie tackles the alien invasion in a very similar angle to the previous one. No interesting new stuff or an alien perspective on things, just another, bigger ship coming along to take our stuff. Although the mothership finds Earth because of a distress signal, no efforts are made by the aliens to save their kin, who are just locked up. It seems like they're trying to mix things up by throwing in a rival race, but they end up not using that at all except to advance the plot and bait a sequel. But a simple plot might work, maybe it looks really cool? Although the actual effects are mostly well made (I specifically had problems with some of the CGI on the aliens and crowds) they are used to varying effects. Some of the sci-fi looks really bland or overdone, most notably the moon base and the giant ship, but some of it looked smart. In my opinion, the mix of alien and human stuff looked the best of the movie.Sadly, the spaceships do not come to their right in this movie. Most of the dogfights were boring and those are the main action scenes. The camera shook a lot during them and the level of zoom was never right, either focusing on a pilots expression or showing the battle from afar in all its sci-finess but too chaotic to distinguish anything. Firefights weren't that glorious either, with main characters having thick plot armour and impeccable aim.Not that I cared much. Most main characters didn't have arcs or really boring ones, with backstory and motivation delivered ham-fisted. Most things the characters said were either a one-liner, created comic relief or advanced the plot. There were a few 'inspiring' speeches, but I felt only 1 worked. They seemed to have some interesting ideas, with an African warlord that has fought aliens his whole life and a guy that cared for Okun in a coma, but both were only used to deliver one-liners, comic relief or advance the plot.Honestly, the movie doesn't have much going for it, but what makes it worse is the insane love it has for the original. Although he is not in the movie, Will Smiths character is deified and except for one character everyone from the last movie is treated with great respect at all times. It's a love letter to the original, without telling us what exactly was so great about the first one anyway.(note: I rate movies on a 3-star scale, with a 4 corresponding to 1 star and 0 stars reserved for the absolute worst.)",Independence Day - Resurgence

After watching the 1st part multiple times in theaters and satellite, had huge expectations when I took the seat in the theater to watch this movie, however was bored stiff by interval. By the time credits started rolling I was looking for a way out.Here is what I think Roland Emmerich got it wrong. When ID 1 was released in 1996, there were rarely any movies which showed the global destruction via CGI in that detail and hence it looked believable..couple that with the acting capabilities of stars like Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman, Randy Quaid etc, it gave a different dimension to the movie. Even though the plot was BS it was still an acceptable BS. Fast Forward to 2016, at least 20 movies have been released in the last 20 years which have shown the same or better level of global destruction (movies like The Avengers, 2012, San Andreas etc). The plot of this movie (if at all there was one) is so stupid and idiotic that you really cannot compare the earlier installment with this. Logic goes out of the window the moment the movie starts and viewers are taken for granted.

This is a shame in my opinion, but I don't blame the director.Regardless of the quick 'pew-pew laser-laser explosions', Hollywood is known for nowadays, the movie seems to still have a feel like the original. Inside jokes galore and overall the movie's end is very fulfilling. Therefore I recommend this movie for anyone with a slight interest in science-fiction.",Independence Day - Resurgence

This is just an awful movie and I would heavily recommend not watching it. You will miss nothing and you will likely be annoyed with yourself if you do. There is pretty much no plot, other than copy the first movie, but make it much worse, poor acting, lots of lines from the first movie are copied; at times it tries to be funny and is not. I don't know why some people who appear to have marked it 10 out of 10 have appeared as such as if you drill into most of these ""10's"" you will see they have rated it very lowly. Anyone else giving it a 10 has been abducted by aliens. In summary; this is truly bad.",Independence Day - Resurgence
756,rebeccahenzwaffen,What happened to the writer from this movies?,3,26 July 2016,"I watched the movie in the theaters to have a ""full experience"" (I saw first the Portuguese dubbed version of it) and all I felt was that from the middle to the end of the movies they totally changed writers or something??? At the start they situate the viewer very well setting the whole story in motion, at first I thought it was a bit weird how they were going to use a new protagonist (a white one, at that) instead of using Will Smith's son (a very questionable decision at best), still not thinking too much of that, I kept on watching the movie mostly for the action sequences than anything else, the dialogue was useless to say the least and most of the characters where two-dimensional from start, and the ones that seemed to have something important (for example Maika Monroe's character) ended up being thrown out and replaced by very idiotic stereotypes at the end of the movie. Not to mention the relationship between Brent Spiner's character and John Storey's character, even if you didn't pay real attention to their dialogue you would have noticed how forced their last scene is, I do know this type of movies is directed mainly for straight male audience, but they left it too intended for the two of them to be a couple of some kind at the end, but this is completely ruined in their last dialogue, which leaves the question of ""what happened to the first intended end that was coming up from ALL the other dialogue they had?"". At first I thought all the bad jokes came from the Portuguese dub, and so I watched it AGAIN with the original English dub... didn't change a thing, most jokes, like I said before, where aimed at the straight male audiences, making characters like Maika Monroe's the defenseless woman stereotype even after establishing her as a good pilot at the very start of the movie. My ending conclusion is: the movie makes no sense at all, the start if very good but somehow it declines to ruins after the end of the first act and the middle of the movie, there are way too many forced jokes and action scenes to make the movie longer for sure, but other than that I recommend you all to watch the first hour and then forgetting about it.",Independence Day - Resurgence
757,stuartarmay,"Terrible, terrible movie, disappointed is an understatement",1,3 August 2016,"I've signed up to IMDb just to review this film and hopefully save someone the 2 hours of their life that I will never get back.I was a big fan of the original movie and was excited at the prospect of the sequel which I thought from the trailer was going to be just was epic and full of nostalgia. How wrong I was!! Clearly Will Smith had read the script, or piece of toilet paper it was written on, and decided to give it a miss.The acting throughout was very poor, even from the original characters which was disappointing. I felt no empathy for the characters and couldn't care whether they lived or died, the characters were weak and attempts to draw the audience to them failed. Despite what must have been a substantial death toll when the ""mother Ship"" arrived the very poorly scripted jokes continued and no-one really seemed bothered.As for the script itself it was an insult to the original film. Despite using the alien technology to improve defences, of which a lot was made of, they were so ineffective that they might as well not have bothered, the defences being very swiftly wiped out by the alien vessel. Drilling to the Earth's core in the middle of the ocean seemed to have no affect on the surrounding environment which was fortunate... A very loose plan was hatched to defeat the aliens as the movie continued and fortunately for Earth it actually worked, it was fortunate really that the ""Queen"", while able to withstand fusion weapons and control alien ships was defeated by small arms fire while chasing after a school bus across the desert near Area 51. As for the other ""alien"" visitor, I don't really know what to say....It made little sense since they held the key to defeating the aliens despite being wiped out by them and although a ""Queen"" had never been defeated, presumably because so are so strong, here on Earth we managed it with relative ease.Sometimes you can enjoy a bad movie because it's fun to watch, this isn't one of those movies, it was awful, awful, awful, awful.",Independence Day - Resurgence

Is it a great movie? No, but it's not a bad one either. If you enjoyed the first one and you love or like Sci Fi then this movie is worth a watch. I mean come on people, it's a movie! Movies are suppose to be cheesy and stretch the truth, that's why it's a movie! Critics now a days are so negative and expect waaay too much. This movie was enjoyable and fun. The CGI was awesome! The story line/plot was just okay. Some of the acting, especially from the younger actors was just okay. I'm not sure if I necessarily bought into all of them. This movie does miss Will Smith...I know I did. Jeff Goldblum was good, but I liked him better in the original. The one thing l did really enjoy about the movie is that it showed us more of the Aliens. We got to see deeper into their species and technology, which personally I thought was really cool. The scientist with the long, white hair and glasses from the first movie was most of the comic relief, I enjoyed his character. Overall this movie is a 7/10 for me.

It's a shame that some good actors just slightly destroyed their reputation and it's going to take them a long time to recover. The script is written in such a way that the actors HAVE to act awful.It's like the writers had a bowl of cheesy, expired lines from which to choose before shooting each scene.There are characters that have nothing in the movie, and simply make it more annoying- see Floyd, who is played by the writer, who probably wanted desperately to appear in the movie. I'm sorry, but your role is simply ANNOYING.Nothing is credible, it's like a 5 year old tried to make a movie, and even this is an insult to a 5 year old.I don't get it how people get away with it, it's such a shame that they didn't think it through for what could've been an incredible part 2.

760,olijordan-86707,"The worst theatrical release of the year so far, I'm not joking (Spoilers)",2,14 August 2016,"Note:This is my first review ever so if its not great that's why.Oh my god was this movie bad, i mean what an uninspired, poorly acted (for the most part) and total insult to fans of the first film (which is awesome by the way). When i heard about and Independence Day sequel i was really excited i mean i had no reason not to be, Roland Emmerich was to direct the film, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman, Judd Hirsch and even Brett Spiner returned to star with was so cool. Will smith sadly does not return and that is was a problem we get into later.Along side the original actors we have a new young set of cast members to enjoy....Liam Hemsworth/Jake Morrison is the only new actor to give a half decent performance, even though he's character is total bore.He's not great by any stretch of the imagination but he actually tries and does have some charisma to him but overall a very okay serviceable performance.Jessie T. Usher/Dylan Hiller This guy was the worst part of the movie by far, his performance was awful, he was so boring and charismatic, he had no interesting dialogue and his character was so bland and unlike able, and this is meant to be Will Smiths replacement for shame...Maika Monroe/Patricia Whitman The little girl in the first movie was better than her and that's hard to say because i really like Maika Monroe but here she is really bad, her character is only here to be Liam Hemsworth's finance and her dialogue offers nothing more than her rambling on about unimportant drivel as she Skype's or something Liam Hemsworth or constantly worries about her farther, this wouldn't be so bad if she actually had a likable persona, which she's does not so it just sucks.The worst part of movie involved Judd Hirsch and a bunch on annoying and terrible child actors driving to Jeff Goldblum in a school bus, it was so pointless and awful and didn't need to be in the movie at all.Its only purpose was to create a really bad chase sequence at the end of the film.Now onto the worst characters in the entire movie, I'm not going to bother naming the actors as there is no point as they're are going nowhere after this I'm talking about Liam Hemsworth's friend Charlie and Davids Levinsons assistant Floyd who are basically the same, they attempts at comic relief but the stuff they spout out is unfunny and terribly written ruins a lot of the good moments, the movie doesn't need to be funny, and if it does why THE WHY DID YOU KILL OF WILL SMITH.The Script was dreadful with nothing new, poor dialogue, boring characters and ending that sets up a sequel so poorly that's its laughable, its a literal rewrite of the the first film only done so much worse.To make this worse there were 5 screen writers and TWO of them wrote the first film, how does that even work.The action was on par with transformers, just a bunch explosions and beams and guns firing, totally boring and didn't excite me at all., the aliens looked cool at moments and awful at others, its like they went of budget at had to use lesser effects half way through production.The final attack feels very familiar to any science fiction movie ever with the whole we had to destroy the mother ship to stop attack, Bill Pullman dies by blowing up the mother ship which really annoyed me off because that means the next movie will be of the new young characters, then the mother alien attacks then have to destroy her but all shooting at her a long time until she dies, the mother ship then goes back to space and on reveals that the sphere is asking them to attack the harvester planet in exchange for new technology, a most awful ending to an awful film, which sets a sequel which will be awful.The Only good part of this is the original cast but even they don't save it from being a terrible film.This movie is really bad and has very very few redeeming qualities, but the negatives massively outweigh its very few positives.

People should stop paying to watch these type of films so the studios refocus their goals into making good things instead of just something that gives them money.I saw the first one when I was a kid and as kids usually if there are explosions it's more than enough to like it. I knew (just from the trailer) that this was going to be a terrible film.There were so many characters that didn't add anything to the story. There were some lines as well that didn't add anything. The jokes were terrible, and so was the acting.The editing wasn't that good either. There were a lot of shots that you couldn't see what was going on. You only knew something with action and explosions was happening.The only things I was expecting to be good were the VFX. However, I could see were green screen was used everywhere. The shots were everything was CG were good though. I don't expect anything less from MPC. The problem is were live action was used composited with CG. Those shots were horrible.I can't review the sound mixing because I used terrible speakers to watch this.It's not worth watching unless someone gave it as a present and you need some ""ambient noise"" while cooking or something like that.

This film is a really good watch! However as being a sequel, should have had more connection with the first film, would have given something more to the audience.

778,MuffinJin,Two main problems - The ending & Too rushed (NO SPOILERS),6,5 July 2016,"I think I know why so many didn't like the latest Independence Day-movie. As most of us know, our feelings and opinions about a movie weighs mostly on how it ends. If it's a great movie with a bad ending, you'll leave the cinema or sit in your sofa feeling disappointed and then you'll attribute that feeling to the entire movie. I enjoyed the movie, it captured the tone of the first one very well - very cheesy, action packed and humorous. The two biggest problems however was the duration and ending. Without giving anything away, it ends too abruptly. I get the idea, but ending a movie like that almost never works, especially not when the original movie ended the way it did: with a spectacular burning debris rain. This just... ends. The other problem I had with it was that they tried to cram in too much in just two hours. The first one had a perfect pacing, almost just as much sh*t happening as it was in this one. But the fact that it was a whole 30-minutes shorter made half the movie seem rushed, especially the second half. Which is too bad because it had potential to be just as good as the original. Other than that, it was pretty spot on. I especially enjoy the fact that it doesn't hold off any cheese, like the trend we've seen in most of our latest sci-fi epics. Everything's so dark and gritty nowadays and it's nice to see this movie take a step backwards towards what made the original movie so special. I give it a 6/10. Good, enjoyable popcorn flick.

Since when are dialogues and characters so important in this kind of movie. Especially now, with all this garbage coming from Hollywood in last few years.

I was actually saving it for a really good movie but watching this left me with such a bad taste that I had to spit it out. Where do I begin? This movie failed in literally every single measure. The acting was horrendous. The entire cast (except maybe Bill Pullman to an extent) had ZERO connection to the audience mouthing terrible dialogues along the way. Jeff Goldblum wears a perpetual confused raised eyebrow wide mouth expression throughout the movie that is so annoying that you literally felt like grabbing his face and closing his mouth shut. If a veteran actor is this bad, I won't even get into the acting of the rest of the cast, you get the point. The scenes were laughably bad with absolutely no thrills or any suspense. You really wonder sometimes if this is a spoof movie. Even the music was downright terrible. I felt like watching a cartoon sometimes with the background score that accompanied some scenes.

It felt like the writers read every piece of fan fiction, then proceeded to combine it all together. It could've very well had been a spoof movie in regards to the sci-fi genre. Aside from the terrible story line the jokes were very forced and every character that could have been brought back was forced down your throat. The biggest disappointment was Will Smith's ""son"" in the movie. His role was very diminished, he literally was the token black guy of the film. Not to fault the actor seeing as none of the characters were actually even bothered to be developed. You don't develop a connection with the protagonist, making you not care for any of the characters. I rarely write reviews but I felt obliged to warn people.

My friends decided to drag me kicking and screaming to see this action packed alien film...and I'm glad they did! It has become one of my all time favorite movies! That being said, I was excited and concerned that the filmmakers decided 20 yrs later to make a sequel. I figured I would hold off on the theaters and wait until it came out on TV. I am so glad I saved the $10+ dollars. From the very beginning, I noticed very futuristic scenery and literally missions on the moon. Something was not sitting right with this. The plot was all over the place. It should've been named ""Independence Day: This time it's personal"", because that's what it felt like. It was nice to see some of the original actors, but no Will Smith. It was nice that they brought back the children characters, but they didn't even bother to bring in the original actors. It was very, very odd to have Dr Okin because I thought his fate was sealed in the first one, and they turned him into a cartoon character. Speaking of cartoon character, the whole story with the queen...I just don't get it. The original was just that...original. It explained everything and left nothing open. It wrapped everything up into a nice little package and sent it out. It's almost like they were trying to ruin a perfectly fine movie with an unnecessary sequel. Some parts were a carbon copy (the former President's speech, the school bus in the desert, Levinson afraid of flying, etc). I heard there was a 3rd one in the making. Please don't. Please learn from this mistake. Independence Day should have been left alone.",Independence Day - Resurgence

This is really bad, really really bad; they should take stock and apologize to the movie going public ,redo and re/ release a 'director's cut' waaaaay, waaaaay before they try for another sequel. Sooo, a way bigger ship but where are the city destroying laser blasts from the first film. What did the aliens de/evolve. Bigger ship... bigger guns, bigger blasts. But no... At one point the 'human' forces are outside with mostly small arms against this giant ship and a gazillion alien fighter ships. Wouldn't you run??? BTW Why not ask a big, alien, ally of a sphere, a couple more pertinent questions? You should all be made to redo this as a sort of national pride, get it right and you have one hell of a new franchise.

Only went to watch it as I had a stopover and the cinema was near the airport, nothing else showing. The movie theatre was amazing, the seat very comfy, free popcorn and free soft drinks. Went to sleep halfway through, didn't miss anything!! The logic in the amazingly poor scrip was mind numbing. How were the human craft attracted to the alien spaceship when they had anti gravity equipped?? Any aliens that had the tech to build a craft capable of interstellar flight would not have any problems eliminating human resistance. Why travel to earth to remove the core. There are enough planet with iron cores out there to keep them happy without troubling us. But guess they needed some premise to base the movie on regardless of the dish water thick plot. What more can I say ... Terrible",Independence Day - Resurgence
790,anjinsan537,Good fun really interesting,8,24 September 2018,"The internet zombies are upon us but really as nasty reviewers who want to offload their hatred upon honest fun movies.This is a very nice movie to watch. Most criticism comes from haters who don't actually get what's behind this movie. Too many video-games when they were a child with mum and dad busy doing their thing. May you unclutter your mind and cleanse it off of the dark miasmas and parasites that entered it via the games and TV Programming (that's why they're called Programs).One huge thing people don't get, which is rather obvious for those familiarized with real alien life, is the Queen + Hive Mind i.e. a centralized intelligence that controls all elements of their community. The 👽Grey ET have it. But so do bees and ants and the sorts. Even humans have it, that's why so many sacrifice for the greater good in such occasions, like male bees they offer their lives for the collective. It's what's the Hero and Martyr Programs are all about. Plenty of that in this movie, too. All in all, this movie is actually good in presenting a series of concepts of real ET life. That's the intention of the movie, it's educational and preparing the human collective mind to the reality out there.Another great ol movie of the kind is Starship Troopers, it also talks about a central Mother bug that controls the minds and actions of the rest of their society.This movie should really get people thinking about how all this applies to human beings. How we all have a bit of Reptilian, of Insectoid, of Snake, of Plant, etc DNA.Really interesting and educational movie and GOOD FUN! Thank you Roland Emmerich!",Independence Day - Resurgence

I am not one who worries about spoilers, because sometimes it takes a spoiler to write a good review.I just watched this movie over the weekend, and I have to say, I feel like the people in charge had no idea how to make a movie. This movie was co-written, co- produced by Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin, and directed by Mr. Devlin. This team, who were the geniuses behind the original and responsible for a lot of middling follow-ups before this one, have proved that they know how to structure a story, no matter how absurd the details. The know the tropes. They know the jokes and I thought by now that they would have a decent idea of how to honor the first by showing this one a little more care and love than what it got. A ton more money got put into this one, but you can't really see or feel the love. What happened? How did this not get made properly?You've got some of the main characters back, and the stakes are raised to a new height as a bigger, badder alien attacking Earth. Yet, feels as though the powers that be really wanted to get the action going instead of developing characters in a compelling way. But that's a tough river to navigate as catch up on where the heroes of the past have gone and then introduce the new ones that may become the future. It all has to be done quickly and sadly the final edit we see cuts them all way short of the quick. The returning characters are caricatures of their former selves and the new crew just don't seem to have any motivation other than to fulfill the will of the writers and their plot. For example, the opening half hour is a group of events that appear to happen simultaneously. It's 20 years after the War of 1996, so there's going to be a celebration, but it isn't really talked about too much. Everyone's in a furious rush to get things done and you can see that there are people we should be paying attention to, but there's nothing compelling us to care. Sure, Jake loves Patricia, and Dylan's still mad Jake, but what's that got to do with anything? Sure there could be an answer, it might be in the script or on the cutting room floor, but it's not on the screen where it needs to be. The whole movie is like this.Then, when the action gets going, it rehashes the major beats of the original, but, due to it's bloat, it can't stop for a breather. There are quite a few subplots I'd like to learn a little more about, but the main plot has been structured so that there's no time to indulge, even the slightest bit. But they do make time for one seriously unfunny jokey plot line involving Julius Levinson and a bunch of kids we never really get to know and therefore care about.I think I'll stay away from 20th Century Fox movies until they change out their production executives. It's obvious they're getting in the way of their Tent Pole releases to gear them up for the shortened theatrical release cycle instead of making movies that endure through the love of the fans.As for my recommendation, I do not recommend paying for it (at the end of the credits, there's a card describing the number of people who worked on it and the hours they put in it. How rude).",Independence Day - Resurgence

801,Andy260187,What A Shame,4,23 June 2016,I went to a Independence Day double bill and to watch the first film in the cinema after i was too young to watch the first time. I was surprised that it still holds up to some films today bar a couple of scenes. When I first heard that they were releasing a sequel at first i was a really excited a re match. I thought yes some great popcorn action. But getting closer to the release date and hearing Will Smith pulled out and not being previewed to critics before hand made me more sceptical. I went in with low expectations.This film did not even make those low expectations. Jeff Goldblum tries to be the comic relief but it doesn't have the same charisma and screen presence of Will Smith and it comes out quite cringy. And by bringing back some of the old many minor characters wasn't needed. Like the old guy with long hair who worked at area 51 and Jeff Goldblum Dad.The film like in real time takes place 20 years after the original and we have used their technology to advance ours. This though would properly happen in real life it already for me made this film more of a fantasy then a true to life underdog situation that the first film gave us. We also give us another alien in a shape of a giant sphere which to me seems to give us the upper hand before the aliens even arrived. So I knew we were going to kick there arse.The special effects are great in places and Roland Emmerich doesn't destroy the white house but tease too. They even tease a 3rd film at the end at which i won't be watchingI'm just glad i got to watch the original it all it glory,Independence Day - Resurgence

Plus, Hollywood knew that this one would be a cash cow, just because of the name. The original Independence Day film still stands as one of my all time favorites, and this one wasn't too bad. I think it made a good sequel...certainly not a disappointing as some other sequels, but definitely not on the level of Jurassic World or The Force Awakens. The lack of Will Smith was disappointing, but the film really redeemed itself with the return of Jeff Goldblum and Bill Pullman. CGI may have been overused a little, but it definitely wasn't a Mel Bay kind of CGI overload by any stretch. The battle scenes were great and I feel like the ending left it open for another film in the ID series much better than the first did.All in all, I think Independence Day: Resurgence was a great way to introduce this new generation of movie-goers to the franchise. It even led me to re-watch the first one a couple of times. Not as good as the first, but not as disappointing as many make it out to be.

Without Jeff Goldblum it would be a dud but he was awesome as always. Even Liam Hemsworth was pretty solid. Was not a fan at all of Jessie T. Usher. Thought he was just a bad actor with no personality whatsoever. Make Monroe did a nice job as President Whitmore's daughter. It was nice to see Bill Pullman back as well.

Why illogical - In any battle queen or main commander doesn't come out to battle with week enemy. here for non responsive enemy their queen gets out of the hive. - Even the queen dies.. they got a very big ship, they could have destroyed the earth.. who was 2nd in command.. only one creature so powerful for entire race. - Just because you have a great dad that doesn't mean you qualify to be good. need more story as why he was considered for that job. -Aliens were lacking serious strategy which was not acceptable.

But right to the end I kept wondering when is this movie going to capture my imagination and interest? It never did. I was painfully aware that it was just a movie, and a rather poor one at that, right to the last second.It's difficult to believe that money was spent by any rational person on making a screenplay out of such hollow dialog, poor acting, and such a vast lacunae of credible plot.If you actually paid money to watch this, then the theater should refund double your money.",Independence Day - Resurgence

And they're all related, like father like son and daughter save the world together etc. It's really gay.Probably the worst character was the daughter of president whitmore, who is a speechwriter for the new president, and was previously a fighter pilot. WTF. Like being a fighter pilot is normally just a stepping stone to career as a speech writer. It's ridiculous.

I read on some reviews how the movie is not realistic - Ummmmm. It's sci-fi so why would you expect it to be? I personally didn't find the first one realistic (Or Star Wars, Star Trek, or any of the movies like that). I never go to a sci-fi movie expecting it to be realistic - I go for the entertainment and this one definitely kept my attention. I thought the actors did a great job, the plot kept my attention, and the visual affects were good. Yes, some of it was a little predictable but again, I think many movies like this are. Perhaps it was because I went in with such low expectations - but I truly think this movie has not been given fair reviews.

I generally like most films I watch and am not particularly fussy, enjoy many genres, but this film was just a step too far. The lack of character depth was very poor compared to the original, no real heart felt moments. When it looked like Hong Kong (somewhere in China lol) was completely uprooted and destroyed somehow the debris field managed to find its way to central London pummelling into its landmarks. The iconic destruction scenes of the original, the aliens deploying their main weapon above the Empire State Building, White House and Downtown LA, were far better and made the viewer really kind of connect with the utter carnage and devastation that was playing out. And how Geoff Goldblum's father made it all the way from the east coast to Nevada (must be over 2,000 miles) in that clapped out car then the school bus in such a short space of time I'll never know!

Kill the queen and win. Also, enough of ""4th of July"" cliché. The most ridiculous thing was that the white female orb, which contains vast alien technology beyond human understanding, first called human beings primitive but at the end asked them to lead inter galactic counter attack. In next film probably some crazy dudes will hijack an alien aircraft and go to aliens' home planet, and then kaboom. Happy ending. And how come humans do not have instant translation devices after having alien technology for 20 years? Does all world speak English? How can nomads on desert and Buddhists somewhere in mountains understand English? They copied from Falling Skies but never watched ""V""? There is no creativity and imagination in this film.

825,mark-a-stephens-900-93435,20th Century Fox Destroys An Icon In Search Of The Almighty Dollar,3,26 June 2016,"This movie is pretty awful. Will Smith made the right choice not to return as a member of the cast. Kudos Will.I have an idea. Let's forget about hiring a screen writer, let's just build a movie based on focus groups in China and the US (the two largest box office markets). Forget about having a plot that makes any sense. Why worry about hiring a professional editor? Just throw it together. You know they will come.I actually really loved Independence Day, the first movie. I thought it was path breaking in so many ways...cheeky, funny, irreverent etc.,. On the other hand, I don't know what this movie is. Aliens meets Godzilla meets stupidity!? It's indicative of the downward spiral in movie making ever since Hollywood discovered that the billions of folks in China and Asia at large actually watch movies. However, the thing is, to get pass the censors, they cynically produce watered down insanity with the sole purpose of getting our money out of our wallets.I would not waste my money buying a ticket for this. Wait for it to get to Netflix or something. By the way, I have a question. If the queen is dead and this shuts down the main ship, who moved it? Again, nothing about this movie makes any sense.Thanks, Mark",Independence Day - Resurgence
826,bpm4532,Not bad,8,30 June 2016,"It was ""not bad"". I kind of liked it. Nice way to keep some of the characters from the first movie, but I'm not sure of the point of killing off Vivica Fox so quickly. Yes, it gives Dillon motivation, but she could have used another scene.Margaret Colin was missed and her character's departure was unmentioned.The thing I don't like about the modern sci-fi is that it's so dark - visually dark and compared to the first to the first one that makes it very different stylistically. With all the new technology humans had acquired from the aliens, couldn't they figure out a way to have better lighting in the bowels of Area 51? Or have the recent government limitations on light bulbs been perpetuated into our advanced future?",Independence Day - Resurgence
827,joe-pear23,I was majorly disappointed,4,30 June 2016,"Well, after re watching the first film in preparation for the second installment of the franchise I must admit I was very excited to see what Roland Emmerich had to offer us this time. Having enjoyed Independence Day and Edge of Tomorrow, I was hoping he could reproduce this but sadly I was wrong.The first film was a very enjoyable film to watch. Some of the speeches in the first film were truly brilliant and left you emotionally touched, some of Will Smith's one-liners were funny and made you laugh. The cast, although at first seemed like the wrong choice, developed as the film went on. The viewer felt emotionally attached to them by the end, sadly I did not feel this sense of attachment by the end. You had the characters that you hated and ones that you adored, sadly I had mutual feelings to all characters in the second film. I was sitting in the cinema with my friends thinking, ""Wow there is only 9 people in here including us and its the first week of screening!"" Despite that I watched the film, it was missing everything, I never thought you could be bored through an action Sci-Fi. The acting and delivery of the lines in the film was abysmal, the lines that were meant to have heart and meaning had none. For example, one of the most iconic lines ""Welcome to earth"" was delivered by Usher in the most boring and ""can't be bothered I'm only here for the money"" sort of way. It had no emphasis or meaning to it. The quality of acting doesn't improve, no one acts like they want to be there or actually care. The whole film was boring and too packed, not one character got enough screen time in my opinion, this is why I struggled to form bonds with them. There was too much going on, too much boredom in one film. I looked at my watch then again after what I thought was half an hour, I was amazed to find only 5 minutes had pasted. The most excited part of this film was when Dikembe Umbutu slid under the alien and performed the attack from behind, I wanted more of this as a viewer, they talk about him being such a tank with the two blades but instantly give him a gun. Overall this film is shameful and rather disgraceful, most definitely not one of Roland Emmerich's better films. I would not be surprised to see this film nominated if not win a Razzi for Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip- off or Sequel.",Independence Day - Resurgence
828,mkpenrod05,Worst Acting Ever,1,29 June 2016,"Wow, I can't believe how bad the acting is in this movie! These are some fairly famous actors and their performances here are terrible. On top of that, the CGI in this movie was not good. You can easily tell which parts in the movie were given a little more time and attention with the CGI and it just so happens those are the only parts that made it into the trailer.Last but not least, the movie was flat out boring... All of the dumb little speeches by everyone and their dog were completely unbelievable and I literally sat there in the movie feeling emotionless.It would behoove you to wait for this to come out on Redbox because this movie is only worth about a dollar.",Independence Day - Resurgence

But one night, mid winter, I was at Redox and nothing sounded good, so I decided it was time to put all hesitation aside and give it a shot. Honestly, my hopes were so low that I ended up enjoying it so much more than I ever thought. It was big, dumb, loud, stupid, cheesy, the acting was borderline SyFy channel, but god was it fun to watch. The returning characters were such a nostalgic pleasure. Jeff Goldblum seemed to be just barely putting in the minimum amount of effort, but seeing him up against aliens again twenty years later brought me right back to my six year old self, watching the first ID on VHS. Judd Hirsch and Bill Pullman were so entertaining and seemed to just be there to have fun. Hirsch a little bit more. Brent Spiner i could have definitely done without. He was too campy and too over the top, but luckily doesn't have too much screen time that it would ruin the film for me. William Fichtner is a highly under rated actor who is in dire need of a new agent, and I always enjoy seeing him pop up here and there. Over all, if you're in your mid twenties like me and remember being a little kid watching the first movie in your pajamas on a Saturday morning, you'll have a great time taking a trip down memory lane.

831,photonxp,"""Independence Day"": Core Values",9,1 March 2017,"By Seth Shostak, Senior AstronomerThey're baaaaack. Just when you thought humanity's future was already dimmed with tough problems like climate change, terrorism and reality TV, bad guys from a distant planet show up to ruin everyone's whole summer. It's ""Independence Day: Resurgence.""What's the deal? It seems that the invading aliens, with their ugly praying mantis heads and restless flagella for swatting flies, are here for... our planet's core. That's right: They've come to pump out the Earth.Two decades ago these same aggressive aliens swooped down on our planet like space-faring locusts, to stripmine our resources and obliterate life. Not the gentlest of agendas for sure. One of the truly memorable lines in the original ""Independence Day"" was uttered when the U.S. president, clearly discomfited by the havoc and destruction, asked these unattractive creatures ""What do you want us to do?"" The answer was both candid and concise: ""Die."" Bummer. But twenty years later, getting rid of us is not what drove them to drive here. They want Earth's core as an energy source for their spacecraft.Now that's an interesting idea that might qualify as the mother of all fracking schemes. But what in Earth's core could interest these interstellar insectoids anyway? Is there some terrific source of energy hunkered down in our planet's hot-and-heavy center?Well, since the 1930s we've known that there are actually two cores down there, imaginatively known as the inner and the outer. Both are mostly metal — iron and nickel. Thanks to the pressure of all that's above it, the inner core is a solid sphere about 1500 miles in diameter. It's a hot, supersized cannonball that would be difficult to pump out, for sure. Imagine trying to get the pit out of an avocado with a hypodermic needle.The outer core, a gooey layer roughly 1,400 miles thick that surrounds the inner core, is liquid and less dense. Not liquid like water of course, but more akin to the hot magma that oozes out of volcanoes. It's this layer — one presumes — that is the target of the aliens' unauthorized drilling project.But how do you power your interstellar spacecraft with molten metal? Iron, it turns out, is the most stable of the elements — you can't fission it or fuse it. But of course there is all that heat energy, given that the outer core is a scalding 7,000 F or more. You can compute just how much heat energy we're talking about using nothing more than freshman physics, and it works out to 800 thousand joules per pound.Admittedly, that's not a number you'll be bandying about at the water cooler, but I urge you to compare it to the energy per pound of regular-test gasoline, which is 22 million joules.In other words, this is more than a misguided alien attempt to purloin low-test fuel from Earth: they're going for no-test.Clearly, this doesn't make too much sense. (Which could be said of the aliens' military technologies, too. But there's no time for that now.)Then again, let's be fair: There aren't many movie-goers who expect ""Independence Day"" to be an extra credit exercise in STEM education. And frankly, leaving aside all the funky science, the cosmic-scale visual imagery of this sci-fi potboiler is worth the admission. For fans of the original film, there's the pleasure of seeing the always- compelling Brent Spiner topped by his now-trademark Leonardo da Vinci hairdo. And everyone can enjoy the offhand personality of Jeff Goldblum who, I note, is still able to amble double-jointed into any scene.Undoubtedly you'll sleep better at night knowing that Earth's core — while handy for keeping our planet's magnetic field going — is unlikely bait for mucus-riddled visitors from afar. Just keep them away from your local service station.================= Relay's comment: Wouldn't the molten metal be something attractive?",Independence Day - Resurgence

A great line up of known stars cast in. They brought back quite a few original actors from the first one and added some new big names also. Not a block buster but definitely worth seeing once.. Special effects are good. Be sure to see it in an Epic or Imax theater..If you liked the first one, as i did, you will also like #2. Final note for parents.. No sex and/or vulgar language.

We have already weathered multiple alien attacks. All of the sudden, what's that?! A radar device is showing that hundreds of objects are entering earth's atmosphere. We've seen this kind of thing before, and it can only mean one thing. The camera pans to the leading alien expert, David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), who in this moment of crisis udders four words that prove just how much time and thought went into this screenplay, ""I think they're aliens.""Blurrp. Within the first ten minutes of ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" it is obvious where the budget money went. The CGI and special effects match those of a major blockbuster film, and the cast list isn't too shabby either. But this independence day, don't expect to find cutting edge dialogue and plot. The real challenge this 4th of July was finding a scene not scripted in five minutes. Plot holes and brainless banter make the film at times even laughable.

836,Maxxrevv,A complete FLOP!!,1,8 September 2016,"So this is a very late review of a movie that I was reluctant to watch from the beginning, due to the amount of negative reviews it received. But today I decided to be brave and sit through it all. Unfortunately no matter how brave you are; you can't but suffer badly during watching this movie!!. Where would I start from, I honestly have a problem listing all the horrible things that happened during the 120 min. Roland Emmerich should be hiding deep in a cave after this; I'm not sure he should be called a director anymore; did he actually see this movie before sending it out to terrorize the people?? The writers of this movie should go back to school (not university) and learn what constitutes a Dialogue. I mean the movie is so bad,Its not clear why they needed writers? as I'm sure there wasn't a screenplay. Roland Emmerich must have asked everyone to go with the flow and say anything they feel for saying. The cast is ridiculous and half of them should not even be in the movie. There was too much shoved into this movie, that you could easily cut half of the sense without changing anything to the obvious and dumb plot!! Again they must have thought that people watching this movie are so dumb that they will like whatever we show them!! Really!! Vivian A.Fox no clue why she is in the movie? The following ""actors"" are on my list for an award for the worst ever actor/actress - Sela Ward, Patrick St. Esprit, Jessie T. Usher, Maika Monroe (Horrible). And what is Charlotte Gainsbourg role in this movie?? ( no clue) To leave the best for last ""Liam Hemsworth""; honestly can this guy do something about his acting, he is really horrible in all his movies, but this one takes the prize. This movie is insulting to human intelligence; we all like sci-fi movies, and we are fans of the classic, good alien movies, even the first Independence day with all its cheesiness it was acceptable and fun to watch. Independence Day: Resurgence is a flop by all means, the movie could have been a good sequel if it was better than the first one. Unfortunately they thought that the CGI will make the difference and win the day; Sorry it didn't. Casting was horrible, acting was unbelievably ridiculous (amateurs can do better); no story line, no screenplay, even the scenes were forced on top of each other; bad directing...Good luck if you haven't seen it yet; it requires patience not to through something at the screen.",Independence Day - Resurgence

844,rodneylholley,A Strong Continuation of Roland Emmerich's Alien Invasion Classic,6,26 June 2016,"The plot to Independence Day: Resurgence is simple: 20 years after the earth was successfully defended from an alien threat, the aliens return with the same intentions but with a different motivation. Going into detail as to what that motivation is would be going into spoiler territory but let's just say that humanity may not be the biggest threat to the alien invaders. Returning cast members include Jeff Goldblum as David Levinson, Bill Pullman as former President Whitmore, Judd Hirsch as Julius Levinson (David's father), Brent Spiner as Dr. Brakish Okun and Vivica A. Fox as Jasmine Hiller. Of the cast of newcomers, the primary focus is on Jesse T. Usher as Captain Dylan Hiller (Steven Hiller's son), Liam Hemsworth as Lieutenant Jake Morrison, Maika Monroe as Patrica Whitmore (former pilot and President Whitmore's daughter) and William Fichtner as General Adams. The ensemble cast provided a strong performance but I particularly felt connected to Pullman and Monroe's father-daughter relationship. It's a very loving relationship and both characters understand each other and the sacrifices they made very well. Pullman delivers a convincing performance as someone dealing with the post-traumatic stress of surviving a potential alien invasion, while Monroe adds depth and strength to a character that could have easily fell flat. Jeff Goldblum is pure gold as David Levinson. He possesses the most charisma and you believe in him as the director of the ESD (Earth Space Defense). Spiner is eccentric as ever as Dr. Okun and provides a nice jolt of energy. Usher does well in his first major big-screen debut. I'm glad that Emmerich didn't go with the easy trope of the son struggling to live up to his father's standards but instead chose to go the route of a son having a healthy relationship with his father and carving his own path. Hemsworth does a good job as the roguish Jake but his critics may describe his performance as flat. Judd Hirsch doesn't have a lot to do but adds a veteran acting presence when on screen. Vivica A. Fox doesn't have a lot to do either but you do believe the mother-son connection between her and Usher's Hiller. Fichtner is great as General Adams and thankfully doesn't portray the bullheaded military archetype we've seen in many films. The special effects were spectacle at its best as a giant spacecraft terrifyingly hovered over the earth and world monuments fell in a fiery blaze and left behind nothing but ash covered debris. The aliens looked realistic while maintaining their look from the first film. The action never felt confusing or dizzying and the big set pieces didn't feel weightless as Emmerich used a measure of both practical effects and CGI. The film never lost pace and was a breeze at only two hours. My biggest negative of the film is Will Smith's absence. While the film is in no way dour or ""dark"", there are moments where you miss Smith's timely comedic relief that he displayed in the first film. I understand why Emmerich wouldn't force any of his actors to fill those shoes but I did miss the chemistry that Smith and Goldblum had in Independence Day. However, this is a minor nick pick as Smith's absence is largely unnoticeable. Overall, Independence Day: Resurgence was what I expected it to be: a fun, explosive ride with characters I love and new characters that earn their worth in this universe. I hope the film is financially successful enough to warrant a sequel because I would like to see the story continue with a third entry (there is a tease about a potential third film).",Independence Day - Resurgence

847,PharekOne,The continuation respects those two decades that passed,9,26 June 2016,"My post contains spoilers related to other movies, too (Independence Day 1; Star Wars episodes; the entire range of Star Trek; King Kong 1976 and 2005; Godzilla 2014).I realize that I might be the only one rating this film 9. Perhaps as a standalone movie this is not overly excellent (to me, Independence Day 1 is lame), but in this era of reboots, re-imaginations and continuations, I think that this one is different and for the better.Pros.1. First of all, the passing of those 20 years was handled gracefully. Actors are older, oh yes, and their characters are also older. The old and wrecked character of Bill Pullman with his cane is in sharp contrast with, for instance, Force Awakens' Han Solo, who tries to be the same character as the Han Solo of New Hope - and, with the aging of the actors, I think ID2 is just a more credible interpretation.2. Plausible and nice incorporation of the improvements in special effects over the past 20 years. Everything looks cooler in this movie, obviously, and that is explained on the basis of the advances of human technology thanks to alien technology. Such plausible explanation for the improvement of technology is missing in JJTrek (TOS vs. JJTrek) At the same time the special effects are not overdone. To me, King Kong 2005 was showcasing the improvements of special effect technology just for the sake of showcasing (compared to King Kong 1976), and not as an addition to the story-line - this is done nicely in ID2.3. Retcon perhaps, but Dr. Okun is brought back nicely, and again, plausibly. They also did justice to Brent Spiner, whose character in ID1 was insignificant and thus, in my view, disrespectful to Star Trek fans - now he is a great comic relief, an addition to the plot, while staying in touch with the ID1 figure, and gets the amount of focus Star Trek deserves. Also, he talks about a hard drive or so, which sounded funny in a cloud era - but for someone who slept through the past 20 years, it makes perfect sense.4. Not clinging on to earlier characters. I mean that the son of Steven Hiller is not very significant, same as the mother; this is a major change of approach in contrast to the young Darth Vader assembling C3PO - which was fairly lame in SW1 I think. And yes, the Hiller kid is there, is important, but this is only so due to his father being a legend - which is also plausible.5. The German flag. Thank you. Perhaps there are other flags as well in the parade scene, I spotted the German one; we are talking about Earth so having flags of all sorts of nations there makes sense. Also there is less emphasis on the character of the president as compared to ID1. This I think is better in a global context.Just a coincidence, but the scenes about nations being united and the world government discussing the events is kind of interesting just a day after the Brexit referendum.6. The story of the hand-combat in Africa. I think it was a great idea to present how those events kept on unfolding for years after the end of ID1.Cons.1. Goofs, there might be plenty. One is that the alien ship seems to have landed on Africa and Paris, while it should have landed on the Atlantic.2. Judd Hirsch' character is a bit too much, kind of like Awakens' C3PO. This wasn't funny. 3. The alien queen looks like the giant insect in Godzilla.4. Waiting for the president to give the order to fire is silly.",Independence Day - Resurgence

I enjoyed the special effects but that's all.The scenario (is there one?) is crap, u know exactly what's going to happen.But that actor Liam Hemsworth is the most irritating actor i've ever seen, a wanna be Han Solo/ Tom cruise in Top Gun.Run away from this movie, please don't waste 2 hours of your life like i did.

849,phocspku,How DPRK wins US,6,2 July 2016,"An interesting story-line.20 years after the Korean war, US launched a new attach to North Korea and killed Kim II. The commander of Juche corps Kim Jong-UN automatically became the new president 2 minutes after the operation against Kim II. A squad of Korean pilots landed on a US carrier intact and successfully stole two F-22. They are surprised to find that the F-22 drives just like the F-4 and flew back to Pyongyang. Meanwhile, some spy from USSR came to Pyongyang saying he could teach them some 21 century technology. Knowing a USSR spy is in Pyongyang, US president got enraged and led an attack to the inland of North Korea by herself. Outsmarted by the North Koreans, US president was baited to a locked room where the former leader of North Korea Kim I attacked her with some Juche nuclear suicide vest. Rest of the US marines know they were gonna lose the war so they didn't fight and suicide right there. Encouraged by this victory, North Koreans decided right after 10 minutes of Kim I's suicide blast that they will make some intercontinental travel and kick some American as in the next episode.",Independence Day - Resurgence
850,vahexachatryan,As US President saved the world,4,26 June 2016,"2 hour ago I came back from the theater. I watched in 3D. And, frankly, it would be better not look. What do it?It has been exactly 20 years since the release of the first ""Independence Day."" Although the latter was not a masterpiece, but the concept was already outdated ( ""father"" of the aliens - Spielberg), but it looked pretty happy, special effects off scale, collected more than $ 800 million at the box office, and even Oscar received a Visual Effects Now. the same team assembled (except for the main character - Will Smith) and decided to once again repeat the previous success Will they be able to jump over your head and do better Surely not.?.The story repeats prequel and, in general, does not provide anything new. You could say he was a union of ""Alien"", ""Avatar"", the 5th episode of ""Star Wars"" and of course ""ET"" Spielberg. If the first half of the film was somehow watchable, then in the second part, I could not resist the boredom and sleep. Some important information you will not find here, very few speakers, the entire film is kept strictly on special effects.The script was so shabby and dull, that I wanted to just close your ears and do not listen to all this nonsense. The jokes are flat, boring and pretentious dialogue. No wit is not present and could not be, if you watched the other films Emmerich ( ""2012"", ""Poslezvatra,"" ""The Patriot"" and others.). In his films in the first place it is always worth patriotism, glorification of America and the American people, and so on. D. As in the first film, here again, the president of sacrificing himself for the sake of all mankind! Do not tell yourself. The present president is likely to sacrifice the whole world for the sake of their skins, but definitely not the opposite. Therefore, Emmerich films, despite their emptiness, are very popular among Americans. And the rest of the world goes to his films just for the sake of special effects and global destruction. It is he good at it.About his acting game to say nothing. Liam Hemsvort, like his brother, Chris, played only for a fee. No emotion, no charisma. Particularly noticeable black Gbenga Akinnagbe that I was more like Morgan Freeman - he supposedly most intelligent, knows everything, everything gives out free advice. Even old Jeff Goldblum, who in the first film played pretty good, here the whole movie went with a straight face, and only irritated. The main problem with this film is that Smith is not here; So he would have saved the film. But it took a large fee in the amount of 50 million infuriated Fox studio, which threw him out of the project.Music can be isolated from the pros, the battle with the giant alien at the end and a couple of battles in space.See I do not advise, spend time in vain. It is better to review the first part and do not spoil their good impressions received from the prequel.",Independence Day - Resurgence

The clear pandering to Chinese censorship panels is not only highly distracting but completely tasteless even by Hollywood standards. China is now one of the largest markets for the Hollywood box office bottom dollar yet despite being a country under strict communist tyranny where 70% of its own citizens earn less than $5 US per day and where citizens are arrested en mass for ""thought crimes"" we have a Hollywood blockbuster playing as if China was not one of the worst countries on the planet for human rights violations. China will not screen films that show their government or policies in a critical or negative light so rather than take a sort of high road (or even a neutral road!) Independence Day plays like a Triumph of the Will propaganda piece merely for more percentage points and expects Western Audiences not to notice.

853,loosthorsten,"Boring characters, forgettable film",3,17 July 2016,"I remember how I watched the original movie twenty years ago in the cinema, and after the film, went straight to the next store and bought the VHS.I kind of expected this sequel as well as others to be quite bad, because picking up some old hit movies and putting together loveless sequels seems to be a recurring phenomenon nowadays. What can I say, the reality was much worse.I still can't quite believe Roland Emmerich was really one of the scriptwriters for this movie. The new characters are entirely lifeless, unbelievable and forgettable. Their introductions are extremely weak as well. And the dialog throughout the whole movie is so on the nose, I can't believe this ever got a green light. Basically characters tell us what happened in the past twenty years, using all kinds of capital sins every screenwriter learns to avoid: As you know, twenty years ago we did this and that, etc. Not just once, it feels like every scene has such nonsense dialog, real characters who both lived through the events 20 years ago would never say.The whole story is a stretch as well. I don't want to use spoilers but the key idea of this movie and especially the organization of the alien race completely contradicts everything we learned in the first film.It's really tough for any fan of the original film to watch this. And sad. Almost feels like one of the SyFy B-movie ripoffs. My advice: Keep the original in memory for what it was and just forget this ever came to existence.",Independence Day - Resurgence
854,aliengirl_space,Repeat Stuff,2,7 July 2016,"I'm sure we've all noticed that if there ever was a time for banking on nostalgia, it is now. It has become a symbol of sorts for the American patriotism of Hollywood movies to destroy the President's home, and no other film did it best than Independence Day back in '96. Directed by Roland Emmerich and starred by Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum. The terrorist take over of those siamese blockbusters Olympus has Fallen(2013) and White House Down (2013, another of Emerich's copycat babies) does not compare to that 90's sci-fi action flick that brought us the twist of an alien-ship blasting The White House to dust. So, Roland Emmerich is back again to cash in on the melancholic trend of reviving the good old days by dilating their legacy until there is nothing left but disappointment and the sour taste of a dèjá vu gone wrong. Independence Day: Resurgence takes place 20 years after the alien attack in '93. Mothership is back, and they're hungry for revenge... Or simply they need fuel for their ship, so it is up to the American heroes to kill the Queen Alien Bee before they such up the center of our tootsie pop to power their honeycomb.The aliens make fool out of us. Just having their massive 3,000 mile long ship parked on our planet damn nearly wiped us out. So what happens? They Deux Ex Machina the hell out of that problem. Literally.Liam Hemsworth's character is the white counter part of the empty seat that Will Smith left when he made the wise choice of not rejoining the cast for this sequel. Captain Steven Hiller, the edgy heroic pilot that takes matters in his own hands is now Jake Morrison. (Who, coincidentally, also makes parallel to Ben Affleck's character, astronaut A.J. Frost in Armageddon.) The cast, as talented as they are, is anchored by the lazy writing. The plot is an amalgamation of what would be a rejected H.R. Giger doodle that was picked up by Michael Bay and Paul Perhoeven. It is the epitome of palimpsestic writing, recycling the exact same narrative structure, now void of any development but the HD chaos that is the CG mayhem on earth. The film leaves no leeway for the audience to form any type of rapport with the characters. There is no emotional catharsis for the viewer, only the mindless patriotic impulse to be released from the foreigner that is threatening our planet ( ironically also reminiscent of another one of Emmerich's works The Patriot.) Overall, there is nothing new under 20th Century Fox. The shock of anything falling down is just plain absent. I don't believe it was the cast's fault, they made the best out of bad directing and worse screen writing. This movie is nothing more than another CGI competition between seasonal blockbusters. I feel like nowadays it's just easier to blow up a bunch of land marks than it is to take a risk and create something out of the intertextuality-saturated bubble that Hollywood is keeping us hooked on and boy do we love that fix. They know that we relish in the familiarity of the characters that we grew up with, so instead of taking a leap with new stories and exploiting the full range of a film's potential they'll give us what we want. It's easier to perpetuate the mind sucking formula that keeps the public distracted rather than satisfied.But hey, Liam Hemsworth is pretty hot.",Independence Day - Resurgence

The first film wasn't exactly Citizen Kane, and nor is this one - it sets out to be a brainless action movie with tons of explosions and that's exactly what it achieves.That said, it has a lot of the ingredients for a much more interesting film but doesn't seem to know it - the way that alien technology has impacted human life is barely touched upon, there's mention of the effect that the aliens have had on people's minds but it's never expanded upon, and some interesting clues to the invaders' culture are laid out but go completely underdeveloped. Perhaps if the astoundingly pointless sub-plot involved Jeff Goldblum's dad had been dropped then there might have been a bit more time to insert something of substance.If you liked the first then you'll like this.

Shortly after I finished watching it on T.V. I looked up on to see how long it was, and I couldn't believe it. If I remember correctly, the run time of the film was exactly the same as the run time of what I saw on T.V. After watching it I had expected that at least half of the film had been cut for time or something. I don't think I can call Independence Day: Resurgence a bad movie, because I don't think I can call it a movie. Watching it feels like watching a long trailer where bits and pieces of the film are shown. As a film this deserves no stars, but as a trailer it is actually pretty good. After watching it I wanted to see a real movie that was a sequel to Independence Day. Not enough to see it in theaters though, as the movie does look like it contains a ton of cliches with nothing new added to the genre. Perhaps I'd like to wait for it to come on T.V.",Independence Day - Resurgence

859,hungtinhphuong,Did not meet my already low expectation but did not hit rock bottom either.,5,26 June 2016,"Back in the day,Independence Day was what all my friends talked about. The first movie was not that incredible, but it definitely met most of the criteria for an okay movie. That was why I did not have high hope for the second one. However, my curiosity compelled me to check it out at my local theater to see how it would go. Right after the credits started rolling, I thought that it was not that bad of a movie. But after thinking about it for a while, I known for a fact that some details in it were not thought out carefully. Therefore, the movie itself is somewhat illogical and unrealistic (I know that it is a science fiction). As for the characters, the sequel did introduced new faces as well as revisited some old characters in a very natural way (apart from Will Smith's).To sum up, this is NOT a BAD movie, it definitely lived up to my low hype and it did have its moments. My opinion is that you should absolutely give it a go if you just want to have a good and entertaining time with your friends and family. But if you are looking for something more than just pure action and entertainment,this is not for you.",Independence Day - Resurgence

The answer is a resounding No! And there is a very clear reason for this. Whilst the entire cast of the original Independence Day are back for another round of intergalactic warfare, there is one exception - Will Smith. Now Jessie Usher takes his place as a grown up Dylan Dubrow-Hiller and with new additions including Liam Hemsworth and Travis Trope, they collectively failed to bring the humour, arrogance and likability of Will Smith, instead giving us a very dry performance, and making their characters instantly unlikable. The explosions and special affects are a great improvement on the original but this film feels like a cheap Star Warsrip-off. It could have been and should have been, much, much better.

And a hint for the next sequel about inter-galactic wars?! Come on, dude! Star Trek and Star Wars are coming.

862,lock_and_key_rush,"Great action and a creative way to continue the story, but REALLY needs a prologue.",8,24 June 2016,"First of all, Resurgence has an AWESOME marketing campaign on its Facebook fan page featuring short video clips explaining what has happened since the War of '96. They show how the world rebuilt itself, reverse-engineered the alien's technology, came together to form the Earth Space Alliance as a way to defend against the aliens for when they came back, and gave a background on the main characters. Yet hardly any of that is actually shown in the movie. You're dropped right into the middle of an already-established alien- technology-driven world with hardly any explanation for how the world has come to be the way it is, and characters who seem to have elaborate backstories, but which are never fully explained. I'll say if I had never seen the marketing videos before I saw the movie, I'd be scratching my head a lot, and would probably be giving the movie at the best a 6/10. In fact, it wouldn't surprise me if many of the negative reviewers here have not seen any of this marketing material. If you haven't, go to Independence Day's Facebook page and watch all of their videos. They'll put the movie in a whole new context.As for the action, it's what you'd expect of a typical summer action blockbuster. Compared to the first movie, it has a lot more hand-to-hand combat with the aliens themselves (who I personally think look awesome, and was hoping to see more of), and it gives more background on their species and reveals what one of their original goals was in the first attack. And surprisingly, aside from an even bigger spaceship that causes a lot of mayhem, it's also not a total rehash of the first. While I feel trying to explain how it isn't would be too much of a spoiler, I'll just say it sets up what could be a really interesting third movie.Overall, aside from the lack of a prologue, for a classic movie that was made 20 years ago, it's a pretty decent sequel. I'd watch it again. BTW, speaking of the first movie, DO NOT expect it to compare to Resurgence. The original ID4 was such a ground-breaking and now classic movie that nothing made in its name could ever top it. So if you see Resurgence expecting to see something as good as the original, you will be disappointed. Approach the new one as if you've never seen the first one before.",Independence Day - Resurgence

It is by far one of my favorite 90s movies, and I was very excited to hear that a second installment would premiere this summer. That being said I wouldn't call Independence Day 2 to be a bad movie or the best movie of the summer. What I will say this is was very entertaining and I enjoyed it very much, but there are things that needed to be worked on, such as a few plots holes and logic of the story line. Granted I see potential for a third film and the new direction this story is going. For me this movie made me laugh, got me excited for what happened next, and the special effects were awesome. I know some viewers criticized the scientific logic behind this movie, such as the space ship's mass and how it created it's own gravity to destroy London, but this is a sci fi movie not everything is going to be logical.

Definitely, as against pretty decent apocalyptic scenes movie had, it could have had a disastrous invasion on his Hollywood career!Though the visuals seem to be massive and give you bang-for-buck entertainment, but they fail to instill a sense of emergency, a innate feeling that doom is really about to wipe out the earth. Destruction is limited to just US and China. All other countries seems to be busy watching sitcoms and eating at McDonalds.And whats with Liam Hemsworth and the young cast? Seems like I am watching teenage college movie,..all of them trying desperately to pull off a school project of saving earth!

I didn't go in expecting it to be some cinematic masterpiece that'd have me in tears at the end or change my way of thinking. All I expected from it was just a good old ""humanity fights off giant alien invasion and wins."" Yeah, looking back it wasn't as impressive as the first movie but at least it kept me entertained. The main reason I don't think it's as impressive as the first movie is that it's set in a future where humanity has advanced technologically about 100 years in the span of 20. I mean granted it meant nothing when the aliens finally came back but the first film seemed more impressive because we didn't have any fancy alien gadgets to help us. All we had were regular missiles, machine guns, and rockets. Also I don't like the extensive use of CGI this movie used. It just doesn't look real to me. In the first film, when you see the aliens they at least look real to you because actual models was used, but in CGI they look like regular direct-to-DVD SyFy movie aliens. I also felt like the whole robotic sphere thing could've been discarded. It really didn't add that much that the main cast didn't already know. ""The aliens are controlled by a queen and they'll all stop if she dies."" I think the humans already knew that by the time the one aliens said ""She's here"" and they saw a giant alien in infra-red. All in all, was it as impressive as the first movie? No. Did it keep me entertained? Yes. This isn't a movie you should go in expecting it to be on par with Citizen Kane. You should just go in expecting it to be a good old fashion dumb alien invasion movie.",Independence Day - Resurgence
867,adamblewetta,Nostalgic/See it with an open mind,10,24 June 2016,"There are a lot of people that are hating on the film, probably went in expecting something and didn't receive it. If your into aliens, the universe, like to stare at the stars you'll probably enjoy this film. It really captured my imagination. And it really expands on the previous film (which I loved, it was the first sci-fi film I saw). I remember watching the first one on VHS multiple times, this new film brought back great memories. ---Going to talk about the cast now, so stop here if your like me and prefer not see an entire trailer and go into a film blind. Go see it! In IMAX/XD if you can. I was a bit upset not to see Will Smith come back, however it really allowed other actors to shine. Jeff Goldblum was awesome, very witty, his humor was great. ---Possible spoiler alert (from my view, again a trailer is a spoiler to me.) Dr. Brackish played a big role, OMG was he amazing! Provided necessary comic relief, he was incredible, Brent Spiner gets a standing ovation from me. Another hidden gem in the film was Dikembe Umbutu, played by Deobia Oparei(GoT&Pirates of Caribbean) he was a real old school warrior, *spolier alert* taking on the Aliens in hand to hand combat, amazing. The former president was great too, he does give a speech to be reckoned with, for a second time. I have to mention Liam Hemsworth, this was his best role he's ever had, and he was perfect, though it can't be easy with Thor as your older brother. Judd Hirsch was great, funny and witty as always. I wondered if it was going to be the CGi'd version of the first, but it wasn't, it expands on the first and comes to a great conclusion. With a moral that no one seems to want to listen to. Hopefully there is a 3rd! It won't be easy to do, but if it's done, I hope someone like Peter Jackson is at the helm. And I hope you enjoy the film as much as I did.

871,EnterpriseCapt,...Still a Great Enjoyable Movie. A Definite Summer Blockbuster,9,26 June 2016,"Independence Day: Resurgence is an Awesome and Fun Sci-Fi/Action Movie that I wouldn't hesitate to see again. Now mind you, I'm a smart guy and I've seen a lot of good and a lot of bad Sci-Fi films from varying franchises (Star Trek Franchise, Star Wars Franchise, Interstellar, The Martian and etc.) and multiple producers and, to me, ID:R is Great. While not quite as good as the original Independence Day (ID4), it, for me, was still fun and awesome to watch. And even though it took 20 years to make, I, for one, am glad the writers and producers thought out the plot points of this movie a little bit more. The story was more methodical, the plot was reasonable, given 20 years, and the action was logically realistic for a sci-fi sequel 20 years later.They certainly gave some of the legacy characters like David Levinson, Brakish Okin and Thomas Whitmore justice and added considerable fervor to them in connection to this movie. David Levinson has that ""let's be smart about this..."" attitude, and interaction scenes with Pres. Whitmore, Dr. Okin and even his father were quite enjoyable and reminiscent of the original Independence Day. Thomas Whitmore was certainly this movie's Russell Casse (Randy Quaid from ID4) and add that his continued link to the aliens is further defined. His role in the movie serves the story. And Brakish Okin (Brent Spiner) is still as kooky and funny as ever, serving as the brainy, spaced-out scientist and probably one of the best comic reliefs in the movie.The characters Patricia Whitmore, Dylan Hillard and Jake Morrison certainly stole the show as they came into their own. The connection between these three is certainly present and their story is certainly there. Jake comes across as that hot shot pilot who hasn't reached his ""peak"" yet or learned how to think smartly through his actions, but isn't afraid to take risk. Dylan is trying to live up to his step-father's (Steven Hillard's) legacy and is learning how to be a better, more decisive leader. And Patricia is juggling her life, working for the current president, taking care of her father and recapturing her passion for flying. And yet, when these three get together and into the fight, it feels like they belong and they make the movie, especially the climax and final act, work.The psychologist/doctor girlfriend of David Levinson and the African Warlord certainly add context in that they help in showing the effects from the ""War of 1996"" and even the ""crash"" at Roswell. Even the UN Accountant and Julius Levinson have their moments that round out the story overall.And while bits of the movie seemed a little rushed to me, the story's there and I was able to follow along. I definitely will praise the writers for not using the ""computer virus"" element, as logically, any alien traveling millions of light-years to hunt and destroy humanity would probably have some way of purging said computer virus from their computer systems. The aerial dogfight in the second act and the final fight near the end with the alien hive queen felt right, were enjoyable and look amazing.I like the connectivity between this movie and the first one, the connection between the characters works, and the addition of a starting point for a sequel also works. Ultimately, I love the fact that at many various points in the movie, the military in me gave me the urge to give military salutes throughout the movie.I certainly hope that writers and producers come out with the sequel to this movie real soon and I definitely hope to see the same ""living"" characters with even more development in their personal stories. I really enjoyed this movie and I hope the next movie (ID:R sequel) lives up to and even surpasses it.And, to spite the harsh critics of this movie, I urge that when you see Independence Day: Resurgence, don't overthink it, just watch, enjoy and have fun! I know I did.",Independence Day - Resurgence
872,ericchan-91030,Rushed to get actions started.,6,26 June 2016,"Spoilers spoilers spoilers!!!I am a big fan of the first ID4. So I was beyond excited to see a sequel. And after watching it I must say it is a decent action/CG fireworks film. But I am disappointed as a ID4 fan.1) From start to finish they rushed to get the action started.There are actually decent character development. So that is not my complain. My complain is on a very weak story development. There is much less sense of ""awe"" and ""mystery"" for the aliens. 2) The enemy boss is trying to get itself killed???The enemy boss is pretty suicidal. It keeps on putting itself in position to have itself defeated. It just have too much of a death wish for it to be believable. 3) Much less enemy fighters than the size of their moon mother ship suggest.The mother ship this time is like the size of the moon. However the fighter jets that it contains seems to be LESS than in just 1 much smaller City Destroyer in ID4 one. That was the only way for the boss to even die. 4) Killing the boss doesn't stop their technology from running...OK in the first movie the aliens' main server went down by a virus. Then everything they have malfunctioned. OK fine. But as we all know, killing the boss does not do the same thing. The boss is a life form. It is like saying when JFK got killed, all the computer and technology in USA goes down. Nope it didn't!5) Disabled mother ship won't float back into space.Gravity attracts. A disabled mother ship will just go powerless and stick to earth forever. It won't just float off. There are others. But you get the point. It is a good action film if you turn you head off.",Independence Day - Resurgence
873,koolananda,"Big plus for the special effects, big minus for the copied scenes",5,26 June 2016,"My first review.This movie is a must see for its special effects. When I say special effects, I don't mean the fireworks or the fights (they are quite good, btw), but the imagination and execution behind the CGI.This is a movie on which the leading creative talent in the CGI space has worked. The sheer effort that has gone into imagining the visuals and then rendering it with full fidelity onto the screen is something deserving of an audience.But this creative height is brought down by the mediocre screenplay. Scenes and logic have been directly lifted, it seems, from other movies. Off the top of my mind,(Spoilers ahead.....)1. The concept of the Queen Ant-like alien and its worker drone army is from Ender's Game (good movie worth a watch, btw)2. The fighter aircraft swarm scenes, again heavily inspired by Ender's Game3. Mildly adversarial relationship between the two leading fighter pilots - from Top Gun4. Lunar and spacecraft scenes - from Interstellar, Star Trek series5. Concept of planet-destruction through gravity and core drilling- Man of Steel (worth seeing for the robust story and fight scenes)Despite these shortcomings, worth a watch.",Independence Day - Resurgence
874,saj-84472,Suspension of disbelief and all logic required.,1,26 June 2016,"If you took the first Independence Day movie (which I enjoyed) then gave it to someone with 2016 CGI and no concern regarding logic, character development, repetition, plot holes and corny script writing - in a nutshell, you'd have Independence Day 2.The complete lack of character development means you wont care about most (if not all) of the characters throughout the movie. Some characters for example were so poorly developed you can barely remember their names or why they are even present. The movie would be the same if you removed a good swath of them entirely.The plot is almost entirely the same as ID1, so don't expect any surprises there and since most of the well remembered scenes from ID1 are repeated, you'll feel you're watching a re-run so you'll know exactly whats going to happen, except this time it's execution is worse.As for logic within ID2.....you'll need to bring your full abilities to suspend both disbelief and rational to the cinema for ID2. Very little within the story makes you feel that discussions took place where it was debated that ........ ""we should rethink this because *insert*..... it makes no logical sense/ our audience isn't that stupid/ no ones going to believe that reasoning / this contradicts basic laws of / this is another scene that was already done in the 1996 movie"" etc etc.Just know, you'll feel a little dumber having watched ID2, kinda cheated and reasonably sorry for the actors and actresses who are now forever part of this.",Independence Day - Resurgence

After all, it is a summer movie with action.One thing to remember before watching is the world as we knew it was destroyed in 1996.I could have done without the younger cast. What saved the movie was the original cast. Unfortunately twenty years is a long time. It was a great bonus to see Robert Loggia one last time. The story line moved at a fast pace and at times it was a bit hard to take it in before the action began. There are a few scenes were the plot was revealed by the dialogue and that took away any suspense. The film lacks suspense. Some of the younger characters seem too young for the witty dialogue they were given. If you can overlook all that, then it might be a great film to you.Critical commentary aside the film was good. If the next film keeps the original cast and focuses on them a little more, it could be great!",Independence Day - Resurgence

More action, more comedy, more drama, more CGI, more aliens, and more technology! This is a BIG film on several levels, but the characters confidently manage to retain their individual depth and identity. It was actually very pleasant watching the familiar original actors subtly merge with the new cast. There is quite a LOT of story here and one can't help but wonder if a future ""director's cut"" BR/DVD will include additional back story, which, may have been edited out to keep the film at 120 minutes. There's not much ""filler"" in this intentionally fast-paced film so forget about your bladder - you're not going to want to miss a single moment. This is pure Summer Film gluttony at its best and there is absolutely every reason to enjoy this outstanding new cast as they come to know the alien enemies face to . . . well . . . OK, we probably don't look too attractive to them either. In short: ID Resurgence is a genuine thrill ride and well worth the price of admission. 9 Talons Up!",Independence Day - Resurgence

Mind numbly stupid, Resurgence offers absolutely nothing new to the alien genre. Loud, messy, and frankly boring, there is no emotional attachment and very little urgency to a movie about the end of the world. The original was enjoyably cheesy. This one is just cheesy.

None of the characters that were from the previous film were any different in this film. Will Smith was right not to be in this travesty of a movie unless they paid him some ungodly sum.The Directing was fine. The Special effects were fine. The actors were fine. None of these things were great. What sucked was the script.I guess that they were trying to duplicate the emotions and story from the first film. They even had a scene with a pet to tug on the heart strings of animal lovers.There were entire scenes and stories that seemed forced and unnecessary. Just because it worked in the first movie (to a degree) doesn't mean you have to force the same crap down our throats again.It was like ""Starship Troopers"" and ""Armageddon"" mashed together in some ways.Looks like they tried to 'un-american' the movie to a small degree which might disappoint the US audience. It should make some money but hopefully not enough that they ever consider another sequel or reboot. I don't recommend it.

I watched the first film which was excellent by the way, but as most people felt the first film kind of closed it all off, therefore a sequel wasn't needed at all, I don't know what it was about the film that was so bad, the list is endless really so let's break it down. 1) Acting -------------------- The performance from everyone is either average or that of a failing drama student, and there isn't room for any excuse either, the film has strong list of well known and respected actors that just don't preform 2) Story ------------------ Not much to write about this other than there wasn't one at all 3) CGI ------------------- They say transformers has way too much CGI and it ruins the film, this is literally based around CGI and the worse thing is. it just doesn't look good! Conclusion This is a film that doesn't need to be made at all! the best part about the film was leaving the cinema when the credits rolled.

Now to the real gripe of the movie fans that wanted to be riveted in every scene, surprised at every corner, forget about it, it is following the playbook from the first film for continuity. Considering the events that must unfold in this invasion, there just wasn't enough time to properly do it justice. From the human struggles, the re-establishment of existing characters, our technology advancements, etc. They also could have found more subtle ways for characters to reunite.

885,JustAmari,Terrible... Just Terrible...,4,29 June 2016,"First and foremost this movie is terrible. I gave it 4 stars because of the cool FX but that's pretty much it.The first thing I noticed was how horrible the pacing in this movie was. Just didn't seem consistent I didn't have time as a first time watcher to fully grasp what exactly was happening. For example I believe the first time the movie mentioned something about the alien ship was when it altered gravity. The second time was when it was by saturn. Then it decided to reveal itself and destroy one space station which was FX heavy but not really compelling. I didn't care for anyone on the space station so it was just eye candy to me and nothing else. What really bugs me the most is how nonchalant everyone acted leading up to the reveal. For example gravity being altered in deep space isn't an everyday occurrence, and in the setting of this movie aliens do exist so you would think they would've put more effort into maybe investigating it. A ship said to be 1/8th of the size of the earth. managed to get as near as saturn without being detected. Something that big shouldn't have had to reveal itself. What was the point of incorporating alien tech into human tech if you can't even detect if a mothership 1/8th the size of the earth is coming!!! I watched the movie and I know that the ship was cloaked. But c'mon really how was it not detected sooner. And another thing I didn't like was how there was little to no defense from earth to stop the ship from entering the atmosphere. They had a satellite firing system and that was it. For some reason instead of firing at will at the sight of the mothership they decide it would be better to do a countdown which allows the alien ship to destroy the satelittes. So far the start of the movie is underwhelming. People watching the movie this early most likely watched the trailer too. So we already know that the aliens are coming. So there never was any suspense felt because we knew already. This is just the beginning alone that was giving me a hard time. But the rest of the movie is even worst. First off come to find out the aliens are there to extract earths molten core as a resource to build more ships and expand technology. I wouldn't have a problem with this if this was made clear in the first movie. I don't remember a plasma drill in the first movie. But I let it slide because I thought the movie was going to get better, but it didn't. The movie is full of plot holes, bad acting, and script, and bad pacing. Pretty much if you're a logical thinker like I am you will be very disappointed.",Independence Day - Resurgence

This movie looked a lot like me dancing, just a hot mess.Didn't they have like 20 years to come up with a story line? The best they could do was rip off Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy? Really? The movie may have actually been more entertaining if someone had been running around with a towel and Dolphins were singing So Long and Thanks for All the Fish.Visually it's pretty, but if your looking for a movie with a actual story line, you would be better off knocking the dust off of a copy of Starship Troopers.",Independence Day - Resurgence

It was truly hard to watch all of the cheesy clichés smothering the entire film that have been done time and time again in almost every ""blockbuster"" action film since the 80's.This is a prime example of film makers attempting to cash in on the success of an original film by spitting out a sub-par sequel.

899,healer-38142,A Theological viewpoint of Independence Day Resurgence,6,24 July 2016,"In this review I will view the film from a theological perspective and compare part of the film to the original film.Viewing this film from a theological perspective, there are a few Biblical themes that stick out: Loving neighbor, servant leadership, self-sacrifice, and prayer. The movie begins in a world that is peaceful and all the nations cooperate. They are working together in order to create a defense system that will protect them and their way of life. Soon that peace is disrupted by what is seen as an invasion by a species that wants to use the earth's core for fuel. War begins and the world joins together to fight the invading forces who have superior fire power. This unity is similar to how Jesus's disciples wanted to stop others that were using Jesus' name to fight the demonic realm. Jesus replies that anyone who is not against Jesus is for Jesus. Therefore, they were united against the common enemy the demons. The same is true where the world powers come together to take out invading forces. One of the best things about the move is the diversity of the nationalities of the characters. The cast in this movie is closer to what heaven will look like, people of all nations and races. Also, in this film we find individuals that are willing to lay down their lives in order to defeat the enemy. This is similar to what Jesus did not the cross. He laid down His life so that all may enjoy the freedom of life to the fullest. One of the characters willing to give up his life for the good of all, is former president Whitmore. This is servant leadership as he is serving others by giving of himself. This is what Jesus has taught his followers to do. There is a point in time where the world is asked to come together in unity and pray for the defeat of the invading aliens. This is the important because everyone is looking beyond each other's differences and are coming together as people made in the likeness and image of God and paying to their God. As we see throughout the Bible, prayer changes things and the same is true in the movie.In conclusion, this film was focused mostly on the atmosphere of a looming presence of imminent destruction from the invading forces. It also focused in on the characters and answered the questions of what does it mean to be human? It shows that when times get tough humanity will lay their differences aside and work together to save themselves. The film was also very visceral as it portrayed a world that could be believable therefore, I was able to suspend reality and enter this world. I did not connect much to the characters and the movie did not viscerally shake me as it was very predictable. It was basically the first movie with different characters and different scenery but overall the same plot of impending doom from an invading alien force.",Independence Day - Resurgence

There's very little character development leaving me wondering who are these people and why should i care about them. The whole of the past 20 years was very sadly summed up in the presidents speech which i felt was a huge writer's cop-out. There's certain things you don't do as a writer: you don't solve all the problems with a magic kiss, you don't sum up everything from a previous story in 30 seconds of a crappy speech either. The alien queen was unrealistically huge compared to the drones - what idiot came up with this blatant rip off of the movie Alien??

I still remember the movie vividly despite not having watched it in probably a decade or more. It was a great movie, and it's sequel does a reasonable job continuing the story. With all the reverse engineering going on, plus the alien theme, it reminds me greatly of the Xcom series of games.

I think that even when big production companies have thew technology to make a better movie using their amazing special visual effects, they can connect with the audience as they used to do. I would give a 7 to this tittle for the nice visual effects and good acting performances in it. I think Hollywood would think more about what people want to watch and not what they think would be good to show. I would love to have the chance to direct a Hollywood movie because I love to grab peoples hearts showing them my videos.One day Hollywood would notice that they are losing thousands of audience everyday.

The story-line lacked any depth and there were no real hidden surprises, that said, Brent Spiner as Dr Brakish Okum emerging from the 20 year coma, looking as if he had been napping for a few hours was a bit of a surprise. Yes, the special effects team I take my wee tartan bonnet off to, and you deserve all 4 of the points in my review. There are a few humorous moments and one or two predictable moments and lots of unbelievable moments that kept me from nodding off; but all in all an extremely poor sequel to an otherwise fabulous movie.",Independence Day - Resurgence
911,davidpitrucha,Opinions are in...,7,7 October 2016,"As a fan of the original ID4 film, I was hesitant to dive into a sequel after so many years. I've probably seen the original so many times, I can quote the whole thing verbatim. The absence of Smith, and a whole host of new Hollywood young blood made me even more hesitant. I actually missed the premiere, and ended up waiting some time before actually being able to see this. I saw the other reviews, and read the toxic criticism, and wondered how on earth so many people can have such short term memories. I mean, it's as though people that saw this movie were expecting something else.With exception to maybe three films, Emmerich isn't the deliverer of masterpieces, or even really great movies.Nearly all of his films are b-grade camp, with shallow character development, over-blown special effects, and incomprehensible plot logic. To actually walk into one of his films and expect nothing less isn't the fault of the filmmaker, it's the fault of the viewer.We've had twenty years of Roland Emmerich. From The Day After Tomorrow, 2012, and even, yes... Stargate (which was also a major box-office failure).What sets Emmerich's films apart is that they are entertainment for pure entertainment's sake. There is no deeper meaning, no hidden agenda, and no Shakespeare storytelling. What you see is exactly what you get. By and large this is what has made his films survive, and become such cult icons for the past twenty years. I honestly don't imagine any film will ever be able to fill the shoes of the original Independence Day film, and I wouldn't want it to. For all the ""problems"" that people seem to have with this film, there were just as many with the first. Characters that came and went too quickly. Characters with little in the way of backstory. Ridiculous escapes and plot logic... Twenty years ago we weren't so jaded. We weren't so quick to crucify a film, and we didn't all have access to this thing called, internet, were we could all expose our opinions for the world to see. And believe me, opinions are like butt-holes. Everyone has them, and they are full of crap. The only thing that really makes this a bad movie, isn't the movie itself, it's the fans expecting it to be something that it isn't, or ever was intended to be.I really enjoyed this movie for what it was. A clutch at the past, and a chance to see some of my favorite characters come back together for a reunion, and maybe save the world again in some ridiculous way that only Roland Emmerich can deliver.",Independence Day - Resurgence
912,trihamsupp,"Nice trip down nostalgia road, but that's it",2,8 October 2016,"Before watching this movie, I re-watched the first part to remind myself of the glory of the first part. I was utterly disappointed after about 15 minutes into this one. It was nice to see all the familiar faces of the first movie, but then again, Resurgence packed in an additional of ~20 other ""heroes"", which made it rather hard to keep up with who is important and who isn't and why are they even in the movie.Liam Hemsworth did especially bad for letting out an arrogant youngster. And with most of the side characters I honestly thought they were gonna die. Surprisingly, they didn't.2 out of 10, but only for the nostalgia. Elsewise I would give 1",Independence Day - Resurgence
913,celikbasturk,Pathetic,1,8 October 2016,"I'm just curious: how much longer Hollywood will make films about the narcissism of American ""super-nation"" which ""rules the Planet Earth"" and saves us all from the Apocalypse. I wonder: do the Americans really continue to swallow all this and not feel shame for this nonsense, or at least acid indigestion? This is really getting annoying. The only thing that can be noted in this movie is the visual effects. It's a pity that Hollywood has accustomed people to such movies, which is completely missing the art and intellect - only technology and artificial graphic arts. Actually, it seems that the activities of the Hollywood mainstream, ""riveting"" thousands of films a year, just corny fulfills a political order of the American elite, which has degenerated morally and intellectually so that really believes in their own uniqueness and superiority over all in the world.

914,wizzards_domain,Great movie. Certainly better than many other movies out there today!,8,29 October 2016,Compared to some of the other trash movies or sitcoms out there this movie was great. Was nice to see the franchise with upgraded special effects. 20 years later and with new toys. Bigger and meaner aliens. We get an alien queen harvester this time. The story was basically the same. But with a few different actors. More friendly deaths. And a slightly different story line from the previous title. I certainly loved the end when they revealed interstellar travel was now an option in the future.

The story feels like it was slapped together & not even reviewed. And the acting - wooden! Even for the veterans it seemed strained, almost forced.

Great special effects, loyal to the original, and I like the fact that it actually feels a natural continuation of the original. The story line is OK, but writing and dialog is predictable, trite, cheesy, and has no soul. If you're familiar with Chinese brands, you can clearly see the movie was sponsored by multiple Chinese businesses, as the advertisement was a little too obvious, especially in the beginning of the movie; but again, I guess that's how big budget movies get made nowadays.

920,andyeccy,Resurgence is everything i expected and then some.,10,7 August 2016,"There is a lot of hate in the movie world these days. So much so that we see many sequels canceled before the movie has even released. This is so frustrating for people like me who love our movies and generally stories, we want to see them finished.So let me give this movie the review it deserves. No insults, No bias opinion. Just the objective facts, including the bad. As-well as my opinion.Trilogies cannot be reviewed as an individual movie, this is a mistake a lot of people seem to make. Stand alone sequels are fine, but a connecting story is different.Pirates of the Caribbean is an intertwined connected story. Aliens 1, 2, 3 are much more stand alone.This movie is a massive setup for a major story, it has its own battles take place, but you must not view them as a final battle to truly and fairly review the story.The movie takes us through all of the new tech than humanity has obtained from the years since the first invasion, tension builds as you can sense the looming threat. We know whats coming. And as soon as the lights switch on. So does our protagonists.There is no preventing it. They are prepared. They are here in force. Is this the full might of the alien forces? It becomes clear.No.And even then, They have their work cut out for them. But there is hope, something mysterious, the aliens know it. And desperately work to snuff it out.What is revealed sets the scene for the future movie, and it is exciting. It's fascinating and mysterious, and its absolutely awesome what transpires throughout this movie. So do not feel as if its a massive trailer.A lot of people talk about how its corny, awful.. A lot of objective trigger words but without real constructive explanations behind it.So let me talk about the cons a bit objectively.The victory is small. In the grand scheme of things, it most certainly does not feel as complete as the victory in the first movie. This time, its much more relevant to say.Well ****. That just happened.For me personally, it makes a lot of sense. But this is definitely something that i can see as more of a con than a pro.people tend to have a passionate hate against cgi, well this uses a lot of that. so.. yeah. (this is a personal pet hate of mine, the better cgi gets, the more fantastical movies can be. its not a bad thing, but somehow it's seen as such.) There isn't much chance for character development - While this is most certainly true, i didn't personally mind it. I imagine there are those that will. But despite this, the movie is a bout an intense alien invasion, and the focus is where i personally wanted it.War of the worlds focused on all the wrong areas, (I wanted to see over that hill dammit!) But again, this is still a con.There are of course more, you can pick apart any movie for hours. And i dislike nitpicking.So despite all of this, the movie focuses on all the areas we want. The intense carnage leaves literally no room for in the trenches stories, it feels cold, sudden, and instant. So much so, some people have considered this a con because it doesn't feel as though countless people just met their end.Well. When you take an entire city, and drop it on another city.They met their end. You don't see it. You just see fire, dust, and that's it.Please don't let the cons ruin the movie for you, every movie has them. One con that ruins a movie for you most certainly exists in one you love. So please stop making it harder and harder for movies success.The standards of movies has not dropped. Expectations has just become unrealistic. A good movie like this is far better than the likes of one of those that's only good, Because its bad.Sharknado. -.-",Independence Day - Resurgence
921,mepdesignerz,A remake that should have never happened,1,26 March 2017,"I loved the original movie but this one fell way short. The entire thing played like a bad teen movie romance. They chose these actors for looks not substance. Why didn't they ask the actress who originally played Whitmore's daughter to return for her role? What about the kid who played Dylan in the original? The ones they casted were very pretty faces but none of them could carry a scene on their own if their life depended on it.The opening was way too long as they attempted to acquaint us with the characters we originally fell in love with. Unfortunately, I now I hate Jeff Goldblum's character, David Levinson. In the original, he couldn't bare to part with his wedding ring because he was so in love with his ex- wife and still held hope they could work things out. Did we even get a reason why they aren't together in this new one? But that wedding ring that meant everything to him is suddenly gone in favor of a newer, skinnier, younger model. Way to ruin a story line by making it so superficial with a really unnecessary romance. Did every character have to have a hookup? If the actress couldn't return, they could have explained her absence easily. They had no problems killing off Will Smith's character in a very un-heroic way. Same could have been afforded her or have her off screen. And then we have Bill Pullman's Whitmore as a crazy person who has to die like Dennis Quaid in the first one. Oh and don't even get me started on killing off the woman president and THEN giving the new male president a speech that felt like it tried to copy the original but fell really flat.The story line was weak. I'd be here forever pointing out all the holes in the plot line never mind having to sit through this atrocity a second time just to try to make sense out of the plot holes I originally was confused about watching the 1st time! The actors were horrible.

This resulted in incomplete dialogues, causes without any effects, and effects without any causes.It's nice they referenced the first movie, which came out in 1996. It'll be even nicer if they referenced it once, and then moved on. The first 20 minutes of this movie seemed to act as if no one saw that first movie...in 1996, in case you forgot.In many instances, they literally just copied the script from the first movie.I was looking forward to viewing this. and indeed, there were some good parts to it.

I got all settled in to my home movie theater and with anticipation building, I pushed play......This was the WORST movie I have ever seen. The dialog was terrible. The actors were like robots. The few original characters didn't do their previous version any good and that tells me the writing on this script was terrible. This movie just didn't make any sense. There was no heart in it and no sense of unity like the first movie. You didn't feel yourself rooting for the human population to survive. Quite frankly, the cool scenes were when they entered the mother ship and when the mother came out and bashed up area 51.

938,suddhatma2005,"fantastic but hurried movie, ID4 walks a new direction with this",9,25 June 2016,"I found the feature immensely exciting,the 3d screening has been awesome and realistic,the movie is visually great.However, a movie with this massive set, could have done an hour or half more, too many things happen too fast and it all felt being hurried.Back in 96, it was when it showed our first contact has been hostile and a delve into d unknown seemed very exciting. But here in 16,everything is a revelation as the entire universe of ID4 takes a step in the right direction.Visual details has been futuristic and meticulous, plot details however are.. .....loosely put. This movie won't burst us into emotions or wants us to apply for a fighter pilot like it did in the last, but i felt significantly happy for the story it told in pictures.Times have changed in 20 yrs, so our expectations... was a kid back then, a grown up now.... the ID4 universe also has expanded likewise.The movie had its own lighter moments too.However movie runtime should have been the biggest of all...... it does make people glued to the seat......maybe so many low ratings come since it left viewers wanting for more.But still its immensely appreciated.... nice work.",Independence Day - Resurgence
