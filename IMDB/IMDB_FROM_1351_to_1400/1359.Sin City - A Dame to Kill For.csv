0,SnoopyStyle,Look no longer original and 2nd half grinds down,5,18 February 2015,"Marv (Mickey Rourke) wakes up trying to recall the previous night. He was watching Nancy (Jessica Alba) dance. Then he gives chase to a bunch of frat boys trying to torch a homeless man. He kills the guys with the help of the unseen residents of the Projects. Gambler Johnny (Joseph Gordon Levitt) arrives at Kadie's Saloon and gets into Senator Roark (Powers Boothe)'s poker game in the backroom. Johnny wins but Roark gets back at him knowing that he's his son. The ghost of Hartigan (Bruce Willis) watches over Nancy who wants revenge against Roark. Years earlier, hard-boiled private eye Dwight (Josh Brolin) is still entranced by Ava (Eva Green) who keeps pulling him back in. Ava turns on him and Gail (Rosario Dawson) takes him in.The movie starts off fine but unimpressive. The originality of the visual look is long gone. The look is still great but it doesn't have the same shock value. Somewhere along the line, I lose interest in the constantly rotating parade of characters. The most impressive thing is that Alba can still play her younger self. The second half gets tired like Nancy being tired of Kadie's. The second half of the original elevates its brutality but this one grinds down.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
1,Prismark10,Sin City: A Dame to Kill For,4,29 May 2021,"I watched Sin City: A Dame to Kill For a few years ago. I had to watch it again because I could not recall the plot at all.I have seen the original many years ago and I can recall that story. So I wanted to see why this was so anodyne and forgettable..Directed by Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller, this has the same visuals of Sin City. It has the hyper violence and sexual sleaziness.This hard boiled pastiche of film noir soon becomes wearisome. Some of the stories are just pointless and vapid.A good example is Johnny's story. He is a young cocky gambler who has come to Sin City to look for his real father. He takes on Senator Roark in a poker game and humiliates him.Roark does not take defeat kindly and takes revenge even though he knows who Johnny is. When Johnny later returns for revenge. I was just left open mouthed that the story led nowhere. What was Johnny's plan?The Dame to Kill for is Ava Lord (Eva Green) a former lover of Dwight McCarthy (Josh Brolin) who some kind of sleazy photographer/private investigator. It is the best story but it is all overlong.Some of the sequel revisits characters from the original such as Marv (Mickey Rourke) and Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba.)The film is stylish bit it brings nothing new to the table. Rodriguez and Miller should had spent more time on the story.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
2,claudio_carvalho,Death is Just like Life in Sin City,7,8 November 2014,"Marv (Mickey Rourke) is unconscious on a highway surrounded by corpses. When he awakes, he has amnesia and tries to recall his last steps from the Kadie's saloon on the Saturday night. He recalls that he found four playboys burning a homeless man alive and defended the poor man. Marv hunts them down and kills the group.The cocky gambler Johnny (Joseph Gordon Levitt) hits jackpot in slot machines in the Kadie's saloon and invites the waitress Marcie (Julia Garner) to go with him to play poker game against the powerful Senator Roark (Powers Boothe). He wins the game and suffers the consequence of his arrogance. The private detective Dwight McCarthy (Josh Brolin) is contacted by his former lover Ava Lord (Eva Green) that asks to meet him at the Kadie's saloon. Ava asks him for forgiveness for leaving him to marry the wealthy Damian Lord (Marton Csokas). However her strong chauffeur Manute (Dennis Haysbert) takes her home. Dwight snoops around Ava's house but is found and beaten by Manute and the bodyguards. When he returns home, Ava is waiting for him naked in the bed and seduces him again. Then she tells that Damian and Manute torture her and soon she will be killed. Once again Manute takes Ava with him and hits Dwight that invites Marv to help him to rescue Ava. Damian denies the accusation but Dwight beats him to death while Marv tear Manute's eye out. But soon Dwight finds that he was lured by Ava that shoots him. Marv rescues Dwight and takes him to the Old Town where Dwight finds his former lover Gail (Rosario Dawson) that helps him to recover while Dwight plots revenge against the manipulative Ava. The neo-noir ""Sin City: A Dame to Kill For"" by Frank Miller is the sequel of the 2005 movie. Again the movie is so violent that becomes caricatural. There are basically three subplots entwined at the Kadie's saloon. The first with Marv is pointless and ultra-violent. The second one with the cocky gambler holds the attention but disappoints in the end. The third is the best one with a private detective under the spell of a wicked femme fatale that is unable to resist to her charm. Like in the first movie, the black and white cinematography is stylish. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Sin City: A Dama Fatal"" (""Sin City: The Fatal Dame"")",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
3,nogodnomasters,THE GODDESS MAKES SLAVES OF ALL OF US,8,5 September 2018,"This film centers on the relationship of private detective Dwight (Josh Brolin) and that of his former girlfriend Ava (Eva Green) who plays him. Then about 20 minutes from the end, an undeveloped subplot involving Senator Roark (Powers Boothe) and his illegitimate son (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) finishes off the picture.This film has all the neat graphics as the original. The plot is not as confused as the first one which was a weave of subplots and flashbacks. If you haven't seen the first film, I would not recommend watching this one as the end will be very confusing. Clearly this production is not nearly as good as the first one, but they did a nice job bringing back the cast, I just wish they had a better story line.Eva Green stars as our femme fatale as Scarlett Johansson has filled her quota for nude scenes this year. Jessica Alba becomes a major player only in the last part of the film. Due to the graphic novel style, no one looks like they aged. and Nancy (Alba) still looks like a kitten on stage. The film still incorporates the colorful/metaphorical monologue.""Liquid darkness fills us both.""
""Death is just like life in Sin City.""
""The Goddess make slaves of us.""Worth watching if you have seen the first one. Don't expect the complexity.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity (Eva Green, Juno Temple)",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
4,kosmasp,It was about time,8,14 October 2014,"I haven't read the comic books (graphic novels), that this is based on, so I can't really say how close it is. A friend of mine who's an avid fan though told me the movie did bring the stills from the book to life. And he said they were spot on. But even if you're as oblivious as me, you can't fault the cinematography. Unless you don't like that style of course, which wouldn't make it less good.Performance-wise and story-wise this is really nicely put together. We had to wait a long time for the cast to come together, for Rodriguez to be ready to make this. It was worth it. The notoriety the movie gained because of one of its posters, where if you looked hard enough and imagined a bit you could see Eva Greens breasts in full, was completely insane. Especially if you think about the fact, that she is naked in the movie. As Eva Green stated in a TV show, it's OK to have the guns on posters, but God forbid there you'd actually see implied sexuality (plus her breasts haven't killed anybody ... yet).But away from that to the comic (graphic) violence of the movie. It's out there, but mostly blood in white, in this mostly black and white movie. It works though and the movie is an entertaining ride from start to finish",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
5,classicsoncall,"""One of these days she'll pull the trigger.""",8,2 September 2014,"Seeing as how this film is blowing through theaters rather quickly with disappointingly low box office, I figured I better get going or I'll miss the theatrical run. Even so I had to catch a 3D showing by default as the regular version was down to one screen per evening at my closest theater. I'm glad it turned out that way because the 3D effects were exceptional. I'm no expert but Sin City and it's characters really popped on the big screen in a way I haven't seen in the rather limited 3D flicks I've gone to. So that was a big plus.As in the original, the new and returning characters were vile and raunchy with a hard edge that you don't see in a lot of films, Tarantino being the exception. I always liked Frank Miller's work, so having him on as co-director to insure compatibility with his graphic novels is a big plus. Seeing the original movie from 2005 probably gives you a heads up on some of the players, but not entirely necessary. I'd probably get jumbled up trying to figure out the chronology of all the chapters presented between both pictures so I'm not even going there.Suffice it to say that Sin City is as much a character in the film as Marv, Dwight, Nancy and Eva. Old Town is a malevolent presence, with the kind of twisted, brooding atmosphere that might make Stephen King run for cover. Not that everything offered is credible; I'm not going to be convinced that it would ever be that easy to cut off someone's head with a skillful swipe of a sword, much less four at once. But it's that over the top delivery that makes for a fast paced and action packed film going experience. Not for the squeamish.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
6,gavin6942,Same Great Taste,7,4 August 2016,"Like the first ""Sin City"" film, this one is made up of sub-stories that, in some way or another, tie in to the main plot.There seems to be a difference of opinion on whether this is a good film or not. The reviews are mixed, tilting negative, with many praising that same great look but saying the sequel is ""dull"". I can understand that, but I love that these characters are given more time to tell their stories and I hope a part three will happen (though that seems unlikely).If the film has any shortcoming, it is that certain aspects are both a sequel and a prequel to the original film. That tends to make the chronology a bit more complicated. Now, if there was a way to mix this film with the first, and straighten out the plot in some ways (though not all), maybe that would balance it out. Of course, because of Manute, that won't happen.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
7,jboothmillard,Sin City: A Dame to Kill For,6,10 September 2014,"Based on the graphic novel series by Frank Miller, he co-directs with Robert Rodriguez (Desperado, From Dusk Till Dawn), to bring his comic book creation to life, in what is both a prequel of sorts and a sequel. Basically the film sees three interlinked stories set in the dark and miserable ultra- violent metropolis town of Basin City, nicknamed ""Sin City"", specifically characters embroiled in all forms of crime, from corrupt cops, dangerous criminals and femme fatales. Marv (Mickey Rourke) wakes on a road with no memory of what happened, only going to Kadie's Saloon to watch Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba) dance, he then chases a group of rich frat boys trying to burn a bum alive, one calls him ""Bernini Boy"", which he mishears as ""Bernie"", he catches up to them in the Projects, he and deadly residents lurking in the shadows finish them, Bernini is the brand of jacket he is wearing, he cannot remember how he acquired it. Cocky young gambler Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) arrives in Sin City at Kadie's place, he takes young waitress Marcie (Julia Garner) as his good luck charm to play high stakes poker with all- powerful Senator Roark (Powers Boothe), Johnny cleans him out, rather than leaving town as warned Johnny takes Marcie out. Johnny is dragged into the Senator's limousine where the money is taken back and his fingers are broken with pliers, and a bullet in his leg, Roark confesses that he recognised Johnny as his illegitimate son, but he only loved dead son Roark Junior, Johnny swears revenge. Years before the events of the first film, Dwight McCarthy (Josh Brolin) is a private detective living in sobriety to escape his violent past, but still struggling with inner demons, after saving young hooker (Juno Temple) from attempted murder by businessman lover Joey (Ray Liotta), he is unexpectedly called by former lover Ava Lord (Eva Green), who left him four years ago for wealthy tycoon Damian Lord (Marton Csokas). Dwight reluctantly agrees to meet Ava in Kadie's Saloon, she fears for her life, unable to stop thinking about her he goes to Damian Lord's estate and spots Ava swimming naked, he is caught and beaten, he then finds Ava naked waiting for him at home, he cannot resist her and they make love, she tells him she has been mentally and physically tortured by her massive chauffeur Manute (Far from Heaven's Dennis Haysbert), and Damian who she says will kill her, then Dwight is beaten and thrown out the window by Manute. Dwight recruits Marv to help him rescue Ava, they invade Lord's mansion, Marv tears out Manute's eye and puts him in traction, confronted Lord denies Ava's accusations, he is beaten to death by enraged Dwight, but Ava taunts Dwight, as she wanted her husband dead to take over the business, she shoots Dwight several times, he falls out the window to be rescued by Marv who takes him to Old Town, Dwight's old flame Gail (Rosario Dawson) and deadly assassin Miho (Jamie Chung) help Dwight undergo reconstructive surgery on his face as he plots revenge. Detectives Mort (Christopher Meloni) and Bob (Jeremy Piven) investigate Lord's death, Ava claims obsessive ex-lover Dwight killed her husband in jealous rage, while Bob is sceptical Mort believes every word of Ava and is seduced to have an affair, she pressures him to find and kill Dwight, Bob tries to stop Mort driving to Old Town, and breaking the truce between the police and the prostitutes, Mort shoots him in the head, he then turns the gun on himself. Following this Ava reluctantly partners with mob boss Wallenquist (Stacy Keach), Dwight with his reconstructed face accompanied by Gail and Miho go to Ava's estate, eventually defeating Manute, Ava attempts to convince Dwight to pair with her, but Dwight does not fall for it and shoots her during a kiss, she dies in his arms. Johnny visits unlicensed doctor Kroenig (Christopher Lloyd) who helps him, he finds the Senator has killed Marcie, he is let go, but gets a single dollar from sympathetic waitress Bertha (Lady Gaga), winning enough money to take on Roark in poker again, once again he beats his father, Johnny smiles having got his revenge, but the Senator shoots him in the head and his men get rid of the body. Four years after the death of the Yellow Bastard, Nancy struggles to cope with the suicide of John Hartigan (Bruce Willis), she drinks heavily and obsesses about killing Senator Roark, the ghost of Hartigan watches over her, the same night Johnny appears she attempts to shoot the Senator, but she cannot bring herself to pull the trigger, possibly because of influence by Hartigan. After dreaming about Roark she snaps, cutting her hair and using smashed mirror glass to cut her face, she makes Marv believe Roark hurt her and they work together to kill the Senator's gang, Marv slaughters the bodyguards in the compound, Marv is wounded, Nancy is shot several times by Roark, but the ghost of Hartigan creates a distraction, and Nancy recovers to shoot and kill the Senator dead. Also starring Jaime King as Goldie / Wendy, Juno Temple as Sally, Spy Kids' Alexa Vega as Gilda and Jude Ciccolella as Lt. Liebowitz. Rourke still makes his presence as the square-jawed ex-con, Brolin is a great choice for the gruff guy, Alba is still sexy and determined, Gordon-Levitt is good at being boastfully cool, but Green absolutely steals the show as the toxic, gorgeous and often naked femme fatale, I don't know if Willis was necessary. The film does still have cheesy dialogue and small repetitive moments, and is not quite as sophisticated as the original, but great chases, gunfire and high bloody violence make up for it, and the stand out sensational colour still works a treat, like an authentic comic book, filmed in black and white it's the splashes of bright colours, especially in the violent and sexy scenes, a worthwhile neo-noir action thriller. Good!",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
8,Tweekums,More tales from Sin City,7,30 October 2016,"After the original 'Sin City' it was no surprise that there was a sequel; the only surprise is that it didn't come sooner. Once again we get three interwoven stories: all involving Kadie's saloon.One story sees Johnny, the illegitimate son of Senator Roark, win some money on the slot machines at Kadie's before going into the back room with waitress Marcie. Here he joins the poker game and beats Roark. He and Marcie celebrate with the winnings but he soon learns that the senator doesn't like to lose and the fact that Johnny is his son doesn't save him from a bullet in the knee and a broken hand. Seriously injured Johnny only has one plan; get well enough to beat his father again.The next story, told in flashback, shows us some of PI Dwight McCarthy's past; he meets former lover, Ava, in Kadie's and she asks him to forgive her for leaving him and how her husband is violent. The meeting is interrupted when her husband's chauffeur turns up and takes her away. He follows but ends up being beaten for his troubles; he returns again, this time with Marv, and kills the husband only then does he learn that Ava has played him like she plays all men now he is in real danger.Finally in the third story Nancy has hit rock bottom, unable to come to terms with the death of Detective Hartigan, the man who saved her more than once and decides to take her revenge against Senator Roark. At the same time he has come to the conclusion that she is a danger. Inevitably things get bloody.This film has the same fantastic look of the first; black and white with splashes of colour; unfortunately it lacks a certain something in the original film there were characters I cared about; here they were somehow less engaging. It didn't help that one of the main characters was played by a different actor; Josh Brolin replacing Clive Owen as Dwight. Of the three stories the tale of Dwight and Ava was the most interesting; Eva Green doing a fine job as femme fatale Ava a character with a real film noir appeal. Johnny's story was the second most interesting; I really liked Joseph Gordon-Levitt's portrayal of the character and the story didn't end as I expected. Nancy's story was the weakest; perhaps because I didn't like just how far she had fallen but also I'm not convinced that we needed Hartigan's ghost watching over her. The action is violent as one might expect but the comic book aesthetic makes it less disturbing that it might have been. Overall this was a decent enough film but a bit of a disappointment after the first.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
9,blanche-2,"where did Netflix come up with the name ""Clive Owen""?",4,29 December 2015,"I probably shouldn't even write a review of this film, but I will.I got this from Netflix for two reasons. 1) I love Clive Owen, the purported STAR of this film, who isn't in it; and 2) I love film noir.A mistake on both counts.I am not an aficionado of graphic novels. I will say the look of it is incredible - some of it was cartoony, some was black and white with a pop of color, some of it had real people against a cartoon background - I loved it. It was all amazing to look at. The violence was graphic, but not all of it, as a good deal of it was animated. Some of the violence was shown in shadow. I have a thing about taking out people's eyes and slashing their throats, however.And it certainly is noirish in its story and dialogue. But I am really sick of gratuitous female nudity. If Meryl Streep can have strong feelings about it, so can I.The cast was impressive: Mickey Rourke, Powers Boothe, Joseph Gordon- Levitt, Jessica Alba, Ray Liotta, Eva Green, Josh Brolin, Rosario Dawson, Bruce Willis, Dennis Haysbert, Christopher Meloni, Jeremy Piven, Christopher Lloyd, Lady Gaga, and Stacy Keach. The only one not in it was Clive Owen. The acting was done in that noirish, cynical style.If Clive is in any of these Sin City movies, I'll be skipping it. Not my thing. I think it's a man's movie.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
10,Quinoa1984,"disappointing, but not for (all) the reasons you'd think",6,30 August 2014,"Just to get it out of the way: Frank Miller's Sin City: A Dame to Kill For (directed by Miller and Robert Rodriguez) is not a bad movie. It's not. It's got a winning performance from Joseph Gordon-Levitt who knows just how to get the right tone and pacing for a snappy, down-trodden gambler character (his storyline was basic but all of the acting in it, from minor player Christopher Lloyd to Powers Boothe who has more time here than you'd think), and, in part, Eva Green as the main ""Dame"" of the centerpiece of the film. And there are little moments that pop out as exciting and deranged and of course the film still carries it as a ""translation"" as Rodriguez has put it, nay 'just' an adaptation, of Miller's comic book series.But it is still an adaptation as what I might hear/see in Miller's comics won't be quite what you see, or what the author himself sees or his collaborators. And this time... yes, some of the problem with the film can come down to it being so long of a wait - too long, probably - and the fact that some of the actors who contributed to the original 'Big Fat Kill' story with Dwight (before Clive Owen, now, before plastic surgery Josh Brolin, though Owen doesn't return *after* he has the surgery, either) like Brittany Murphy and Michael Clarke Duncan are gone and have to either be scrapped or re-cast, and the fact that by now, nearly a decade later, so much has come that has been like what Sin City inspired from Miller's own adapted 300 to the (crappy) Miller adapted Spirit movie.I can't say that lack of freshness made this an unmemorable experience, however. Miller and Rodriguez could have easily overcome the problem of time and advancement of technology and so on, and maybe to their benefit. They have a lot of strong talent returning like Mickey Rourke, who is always a joy to watch as Marv, and Rosario Dawson as one of the Old-Town hooker-killers. But... the pacing is just off here, and where before the filmmakers went for the Pulp Fiction approach of non-linear storytelling and succeeded, it doesn't this time. Part of the problem is that A Dame to Kill for, honestly, could have been its own movie on its own if adapted in full (from what I've read of fan's reactions, I haven't read the book myself, it's truncated), but it isn't. And oddly enough there's one sequence (JGL's) that is the best part of the movie, and another part (Alba's) that's the worst.So what you got in the major chunk of A Dame to Kill, which is all about how Dwight gets put through the wringer by a psychopathic broad (Eva Green, trying for what it's worth, but sorta defeated in a way by the all-too-basic writing). And here, for one of the first times I can remember, Rodriguez doesn't direct the action very well. Stuff seems just rushed, and something is just... again to repeat myself, 'off' here. A lot of visual excitement went on in the first movie, far as can be recalled. Here, it just comes off as routine, the action becomes monotonous (how many times you might ask can you see someone shot the same way as you already have)? It sounds gross, but at least the first film had some creativity with its violence. Here, with the exception of a gruesome bit involving Gordon-Levitt's fingers, it's nothing much inspired. Even Green and Brolin don't feel very inspired together, and that is a bigger problem still.Maybe a longer cut will help solve some of this on video (?) I'm not sure. It may just be that one movie was enough, and what worked in the comics was enough for one big bang of R-rated film-noir bottle of surreality. It has it's moments, but gets bogged down by parts that are sub-par (Jessica Alba just can't carry the emotion required in that final act, or just wasn't believable in it), and doesn't have a strong enough through-line. It's fast-cheap entertainment that is only mildly so.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
11,michaelRokeefe,"Sex, blackmail and brutality.",6,19 February 2015,"Setting is not too long since the original in 2005. Frank Rodriguez continues to flesh out co-director Frank Miller's Sin City series of graphic novels. Again a gritty noir filmed in black and gray with sporadic splashes of color. A few of the original characters return. Mickey Rourke returns as the fighter Marv, who wakes up near the Sin City projects and has no ideas how he got there. The growling voice matches his relentless brutality. The ever-so sexy Nancy(Jessica Alba)is still stripping and dancing at Kadie's Saloon. Several twisted stories make up this flick. Don't blame yourself for feeling confused. Plenty of rough stuff to go around.Rich men are set up with prostitutes and then have compromising photos snapped to be shopped around to their wives. A cocky young cardsharp named Johnny(Joseph Gordon-Levitt)goes to Kadie's Saloon looking for game of poker with ruthless Senator Roark(Powers Booth). A sudden winning hand becomes a losing hand. Plenty of bloody knuckle and head splitting violence, female frontal nudity, sexual situations and graphic images earn a strong R rating.Others featured in the cast: Josh Brolin, Bruce Willis, Eva Green, Dennis Haysbert Christopher Meloni and Rosario Dawson.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
12,preppy-3,I like it but the novelty is gone,7,2 September 2014,"When ""Sin City"" came out in 2005 it was a big hit and astounded people with its dark tone and mixture of b&w and color photography. Why they waited NINE YEARS to do a prequel/sequel (its both) I'll never know but the novelty is gone. This consists of three stories. Two of them are pretty short and bookend the movie. One has Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing Johnny who has a score to settle with evil and powerful Senator Roark (Powers Boothe). The other has stripper Nancy (Jessica Alba) who ALSO has a score to settle with Roark. The main story has Dwight (Josh Brolin) getting involved with a beautiful and very deadly femme fatale (Eva Green).The good: the photography is great--there's some truly stunning scenes here; Brolin, Green, Mickey Rourke are Rosario Dawson are great in their roles; there's plenty of action (and violence); it moves QUICKLY and the sex sequence between Green and Brolin is HOT. The bad: Alba is just downright horrendous in her role; Boothe REALLY overplays his evil; there's tons of gratuitous female nudity (all done by Green) and the nonstop viciousness and violence wears one down. Still I'm not sorry I saw the film. It's just too little too late.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
13,utgard14,Poor Sequel,4,23 October 2014,"Sin City was one of my favorite movies of the 2000s. A fun, creative film noir cartoon with unique visuals and a style all its own. The first problem you run into with this sequel is that it offers nothing new. It's a stylistic retread of the first movie, only less impressive. The visuals copy the first movie but somehow seem cheaper. The makeup effects aren't as good either, with Marv's jaw easily twice the size of the last movie. The action is weaker, with no memorable sequences and a final showdown that is derivative of the first movie. The other big problem is that the writing is very poor this time and the stories don't flow well together. The Dwight story is lame. The Johnny story is pointless. The Nancy story is impossible to take seriously, especially the ghost parts. Sadly, this movie is boring, listless, and disjointed. It's a movie that didn't need to be made. Still, it's always nice to see Eva Green naked. That's something that never gets old.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
14,zardoz-13,"Good, But Not As Good As ""Sin City""",8,3 September 2014,"""Sin City"" graphic novelist Frank Miller reunites with his ""Sin City"" co-director Robert Rodriguez for their long overdue ""Sin City"" (2005) sequel ""Sin City: A Dame to Kill For,"" with attrition accounting for the absence of several original cast members. Dennis Haysbert, known best for his Allstate Insurance commercials, has appropriated Michael Clarke Duncan's role as Manute the Chauffeur, while Brittany Murphy's bar maiden character Shellie has been retired rather than recast. Michael Clarke Duncan and Brittany Murphy respectively died during the interim between the films. Other changes include Jamie Chung filling in for a pregnant Devon Aoki as Miho, and Jeremy Piven substituting for Michael Madsen as John Hartigan's police partner Bob. New characters wallowing in this amoral cesspool of murder and mayhem include Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a nimble-fingered cardsharp who takes Senator Roak to the cleaners twice, and a bald-headed Josh Brolin stepping into Clive Owens's shoes as Dwight McCarthy. Owens couldn't reprise his role because he had other cinematic commitments. Meantime, Bruce Willis reappears as an astral Hartigan along with slinky Jessica Able as Nancy, sultry Rosario Dawson as Gail, and ghastly Powers Boothe as the reptilian Senator Roak. Unfortunately, Willis drifts into and out ""Nancy's Last Dance"" storyline with little to do in what amounts to a minor role. Since he is an apparition, Willis cannot participate in all the butchery and bloodshed. Comparably, ""Sin City: A Dame to Kill For"" isn't as gratifying as its landmark 2005 predecessor. Despite an abundance of sordid violence, this salacious sequel suffers from being delayed for virtually a decade. Four stories taken from Miller's Sin City comics interconnect in this gritty, hard-boiled, but sadly uneven saga. Two of those tawdry tales: the prequel-oriented ""The Long Bad Night"" and the sequel-oriented ""Nancy's Last Dance"" deliver considerably less dramatic impact than ""Just Another Saturday Night"" and ""A Dame to Kill for."" ""The Long Bad Night"" and ""Nancy's Last Dance"" generate little of the exhilaration or satisfaction as the other two yarns. Nevertheless, moviegoers who relish watching underdogs win and lowlifes die will revel in this agitated orgy of blood, gore, and violence. Similarly, like the original film, ""Sin City 2"" has been lensed largely in black & white, with most of the carnage depicted either in silhouette or with reversed negative colors; i.e., occasionally blood is rendered as pale white rather than crimson red. Sometimes, the color of a character's hair or their eyes appears in color. Meanwhile, the 3-D version of ""Sin City: A Dame to Kill For"" looks spectacular. Fans of traditional 3-D, where objects fly out at you rather than cross in front of the screen laterally, will savor this version over the flat 2-D version. Miller and Rodriguez indulge themselves occasionally with eye-popping images that encircle characters. At one point, bad boy Marv describes a car chase as we see him in a head & shoulders medium shot while the careening vehicles swerve around him. Miller and Rodriguez go the extra mile so that both medium and long shots are angled in such a way as to suggest greater 3-D dimensionality. Often, they insert falling snow to heighten the 3-D effect. Moreover, they achieve this optical illusion of depth without making your eyes ache.Ultimately, when Mickey Rourke's Marv isn't smashing his opponents to pieces with fists that he wields like wrecking balls in both ""Just Another Saturday Night"" and ""A Dame to Kill For,"" this rowdy R-rated ruckus just isn't as exuberant as the original. What Rourke accomplishes with his fists as Marv, seductive Eva Green attains with her breasts bared like an arrogant Amazon princess. Green did the same thing in ""300: Rise of an Empire,"" another Frank Miller adaptation. She manipulates mentally inferior lovesick men with those breasts so that either they kill other people for her the way that Barbara Stanwyck controlled Fred MacMurray in the 1944 classic film noir thriller ""Double Indemnity"" or they kill themselves in frustration. Apparently, Miller and Rodriguez struggled to compensate for the two frivolous segments ""The Long Bad Night"" and ""Nancy's Last Dance"" with pervasive violence that skirts an NC-17 rating. Nobody should take their kids to watch this melodramatic massacre. Name your favorite appendage, and it probably gets sliced, diced, and served up like succulent pork on a skewer. The heavily armed girls of Old Town are back and they don't cut anybody any slack. In one scene, Old Town, sword-wielding Miho spins herself in a circle like a propeller blade and slashes the heads off of four thugs in rapid succession. Marv digs his fingers into an adversary's eye socket and excavates an eyeball. One of the coolest visual effects in the lightweight ""The Long Bad Night"" segment has a surreal flavor. A ruthless villain slings razor-blade edged poker cards at an opponent and the cards carve him up into four jagged slices.If you skipped the original ""Sin City"" or your memories of it are short-lived (as mine were until I saw it again), you may find yourself confused by the interlocking narrative jumble. You may also find it difficult to differentiate the various tales on a coherent timeline. Miller and Rodriguez deploy fewer characters in ""Sin City: A Dame to Die For"" than they did in ""Sin City."" For example, nobody like either Josh Hartnett's anonymous hit-man or Elijah Wood's cannibal ninja named Kevin show up for this installment. Nevertheless, Eva Green steals the show with her sexy physique and gimlet-eyed villainy. She gives new meaning to femme fatale. Powers Boothe's corrupt Senator Roak makes a memorable villain that you will love to hate. Perhaps the most confusing moments occur when Josh Brolin emerges from a facial makeover. Clocking in at lean 103 minutes, ""Sin City: A Dame to Die For"" runs about twenty minutes shorter than its superior predecessor. Despite its sadism and sexuality, ""Sin City"" qualifies as more of a cinematic misdemeanor than a felony.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
15,grantss,"Good, but not anywhere near as good as the first Sin City",7,17 September 2014,"Good, but not anywhere near as good as the first Sin City. Admittedly, it would have been difficult to come close to the first Sin City movie (from 2005). The 2005 movie was simply one of the greatest movies of all time. Slick, great and incredibly innovative CGI, great plot, good action sequences, very gritty.This movie retains the grittiness and good action sequences, but there's something missing in just about every other regard. The plot, while decent, is not as watertight, solid or coherent as the first movie. There are also continuity issues between this movie and the first one.There was also more of a storyline and more character development in the first one. This one seems to put more weight on the action side, at the expense of story and characters.The action sequences are very good, mind you.Even the CGI seems worse. Maybe it is the fact that the novelty of the incredibly innovative graphics of the first movie has worn off, or that directors Robert Rodriquez and Frank Miller tried to be too clever and artsy with the CGI. The first one's CGI was perfect - minimalist with splashes of colour, giving the movie a dark, haunting effect and letting you know you were in a dirty city. This one's seems to bright and ornate.Performances are mostly good. Mickey Rourke, Jessica Alba, Bruce Willis, Powers Boothe and Rosario Dawson reprise their roles from the first movie, and do a good job. Boothe is probably the stand- out performer of these.Josh Brolin fills in for Clive Owen as Dwight, and is so-so in the attempt. I much preferred Clive Owen in the role. He seemed more debonair and intelligent, and less of a bruiser.Eva Green pretty much steals the show as the femme fatale. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is solid in his role.A disappointment after the brilliance that was the first movie, but worth watching nevertheless.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
16,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Worth a return trip, albeit a lesser outing",8,29 August 2014,"Marv(Rourke, hardened) wakes up not knowing where he is. Dwight(Brolin, a restrained, pre-surgery Clive Owen, and since this is one of several major characters who are in a very different place, the recasting works especially well) is trying to keep his rotten life in place, when Ava(Green, *the* femme fatale, and she's perfect for the role, one of the best elements in this. And yes, she's naked in all of this), who broke his heart, comes back into it and he has to find out, is she really, as she claims, in danger from her millionaire husband and his huge bodyguard, Manute(Haysbert, physically powerful and intimidating, taking over very nicely for Michael Clarke Duncan, R.I.P. And it's worth noting that Brittany Murphy, R.I.P., for how solid she was and the role she was to play in this, was omitted, not replaced). Johnny(Gordon-Levitt, full-of-himself gambler, created for this) tries to beat Senator Roark(Boothe, despicable, a main villain in both of the new stories, and more of him is always good) at poker(you knew they had to go there sooner or later, the card game). And Nancy(Alba, alcoholic and desperate, and she isn't bad it's not her fault that it's easily the least satisfying tale) wants revenge for the only man she ever loved.This is very much neo-noir with a shot of adrenaline. The action is cool, well-choreographed, and varied. While the gore is more frequent than compelling, it's in no way tedious, and the rest of the violence is very effective, we feel every punch and bullet taken and dealt. Gender-stereotyping sexualizes every woman and renders the men pitiable at best. This is rushed and runs out of steam before the end of the 97 minute running time. That's 3/4 of the first one, which remains superior, though this is a good follow-up, and stands on its own as well, you can take in any one of the separate plots without the others(and this sets up the 3 big ones very early, so we aren't lost when they're followed through on), like with the comics that this is a satisfying adaptation that puts every panel and frame gloriously up on the screen in 3D that adds depth. This doesn't bookend, and the ending falls flat no consequences in a wish-fulfillment climax that almost takes away from that of the original.I recommend this to any fan of the genre. 8/10",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For

Some of the re-casting bothered me slightly: in particular I missed Devon Aoki as Miho. But the standout character here, for me, was Powers Boothe as Senator Roarke.

In fact, he hasn't really made anything of note since the first movie.But it's watchable stuff, and it's good to get back to the titular place, even if it feels different, a little less loved, this time around.The cast are as good as expected, Alba and Boothe are standouts, and Brolin, even with comedy wig. does a good job as Dwight.But it's too little too late for this movie, and the style of the film doesn't feel as fresh as it did back in 2005.For Rodriguez, this is his Escape from L.A., watchable for all the wrong reasons.Not a bad movie though.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
21,siderite,Something was off,8,24 September 2014,"A Dame to Kill For fits right into the first Sin City movie storyline. Common characters, the same visual interpretation of the noir genre, the same dark story lines based on archetypal characters. And it's 3D which, for the first time in a long time, seems appropriate for the movie. Since it is a highly processed film, the 3D comes just like another processing tool and looks very nice.But something was off. It seemed like it was created solely on focus group data. They used Mickey Rourke's character just about everywhere, as he was the one with the biggest impact in the first film. They made the stories archetypal. This is bad. The characters were like black and white projections of our own inner demons, but the stories should have remained original and interesting. Instead they all seemed to be the same: tough guy enters tough city and kicks ass, preferably for a woman, but just as well for daddy issues.Eva Green seems to be everywhere right now and for good reason: she is both a good actress and gorgeous as well. Her character and that of Joseph Gordon-Levitt actually make the film. Powers Boothe is also fantastic as a villain.Overall, just a continuation of the first film, only a bit worse, more lazy, 10 years later and with nothing new to add.I have to note a weird phenomenon. It was a weekday night, weeks after the premiere and there were 6 people in the small cinema hall, three pairs to be exact. 5 of the people were women, so if I remove me and the wife, all female. Hmm... That's something to give thought to the Hollywood demographers.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
22,Red-Barracuda,Weaker than the first movie for sure but still a seductive experience,8,26 August 2014,"From the outset it has to be admitted that it really has taken far too long for this follow up sequel to the original Sin City to happen. I don't really know why it has taken the best part of a decade but, whatever the reason, it's rather unfortunate. It seems to have affected the commercial performance of the sequel, in that the memory of the first has faded somewhat in the collective mind of the fickle cinema-going audience. Still, good things come to those who wait, right? Well, in this case, yes and no. This film does pale quite definitely when set alongside the original. The chief problem is that the three intertwining stories are definitely lacking somewhat, which is especially baffling when you consider there has been so many years between the movies. You would have thought creator Frank Miller would have come up with stories with more oomph to them. Where the vignettes in the first film were fairly basic, they all had unusual angles to them; the equivalents in Sin City: A Dame to Kill For have really no mysterious quirks to enliven them, they even seem quite pointless and repetitive at times. In addition, several characters have been brought back but in some cases their presence is entirely negligible (Hartigan) or poorly replaced by a new actor (Dwight); the whole idea is surely that this is a franchise based around a place not specific characters and this would have been a great opportunity to introduce some fresh, new ones.So you may be wondering, why have I given this a high score? Well, to be perfectly honest, despite the unfortunate flaws, I still love the highly stylised world of Sin City and visually it was once again extremely alluring. This dark and grisly noirish city populated by grim men and gorgeous women is once more well-presented cinematically. Because the world of Sin City is nothing if not purely cinematic; style over substance is celebrated and that's okay by me. Once again this is a very erotically charged movie, with a particular stand-out performance by Eva Green who simply smolders the screen. The level of nudity in this movie is very high by today's Hollywood standards that's for sure but the erotica is definitely of a somewhat artistic persuasion; the women are consistently beautifully shot. It's not so often that a film is successfully visually artistic while simultaneously being genuinely titillating and this is one of Sin City's greatest hallmarks. In general, the cinematic visuals are the chief selling point again. The black and white photography, interspersed with flashes of stylistic colour are once more very well executed. While the violence is again full on but so stylised to never exactly be very disturbing. So it's basically more of the same really. And while it's a lesser film than the last one, I've got to be honest and say that I still got a real kick out of this one anyway. Its style is still highly specific and bold and is one that is really distinctive from other movies. I've re-visited the world of Sin City and, while its story writing could have been much stronger, it was ultimately another pleasant experience.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
23,KineticSeoul,I don't have high expectations for these balls to the wall movie sequels anymore...,6,28 September 2014,"It seems like this sequel came out a bit too late. And I highly enjoyed and was entertained by the first ""Sin City"". This one lacked the impact, momentum and shock value that the first one had. It just seemed like a cop-out of a sequel. This is suppose to be a anthology film, but it just isn't as blended well as it should have been. Sure, it tried to follow the graphic novel, but they still could have thought up a way to connect the scenarios in my opinion. The writing just seemed poorly constructed into movie form. Bruce Willis makes a appearance once again as Hartigan, but his appearance was pointless. Same can be said with Johnny subplot, which doesn't seem to go anywhere or bring anything really new. Joseph Gordon-Levitt performance as this slick hotshot gambler didn't really stand out much either. It just wasn't really original and has been done before. Plus the character Johnny doesn't make much sense either. Marv played by Mickey Rourke once again is the best part about this movie, but that doesn't really make this movie standout either. Eva Green did a good job as the villainous Dame and it's not because she shows off her stuff either. This isn't a awful movie or anything, but for a sequel that took 9 years to come, it's actually really disappointing. I don't have high expectations for these balls to the wall movie sequels anymore after this one. Also you can't replace Michael Clarke Duncan.6.3/10",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
24,Hellmant,"Every bit as thrilling, funny and visually enthralling as the original!",9,27 August 2014,"'SIN CITY: A DAME TO KILL FOR': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Sequel (and prequel) to the 2005 hit crime thriller 'SIN CITY'. It's once again directed by Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller and it's also once again based on Miller's neo-noir comic book series (with Miller writing the film's screenplay as well). Two of the movie's four stories are based on the comic and the other two segments were written for this film. Stars Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis, Jessica Alba, Powers Boothe, Rosario Dawson and Jaime King all reprise their roles from the original flick. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Eva Green, Christopher Meloni, Ray Liotta, Juno Temple, Christopher Lloyd and many others play new characters in it; while Josh Brolin (replacing Clive Owen as Dwight), Jeremy Piven (replacing Michael Madsen as Bob), Dennis Haysbert (replacing the late Michael Clarke Duncan as Manute) and Jamie Chung (replacing the pregnant Devon Aoki as Miho) also join the new cast. Some of the events in the movie take place before some segments in the original film, while others take place after some parts of the first movie (making it somewhat confusing at times). I enjoyed the film, a lot, and I think it's every bit as thrilling, funny and visually enthralling as the original!The first of the film's four segments is titled 'Just Another Saturday Night' (based on a short story from the comic) and has Marv (Rourke) taking on four rich frat guys. The second story is played out in two parts and titled 'The Long Bad Night' (it's an original story). It deals with a very skilled young gambler, named Johnny (Gordon-Levitt), seeking revenge on a Sin City senator, Senator Roarke (Booth). The third story is based on the 'Sin City' limited comic book series 'A Dame to Kill For'. It tells the story of why Dwight McCarthy (Brolin) had to have facial reconstruction. It has to do with a messed up former lover of his, named Ava Lord (Green). The last story is another original and it's called 'Nancy's Last Dance'. It has to do with Nancy Callahan (Alba) also wanting revenge on the powerful Senator Roarke, for her former lover's suicide. Bruce Willis returns as the ghost of John Hartigan, in this segment.The reviews, from critics, have been mixed (and not nearly as good as the original film) and the box office has been dismal (much worse than the first one); I still loved this movie though! Poor box office, for one thing, is no sign of a film's quality because if no one sees it how do they know if they like it. It's actually more of a sign of poor marketing, or just lack of interest in the material trying to be sold; which surprises me because the first one is a beloved classic and anticipation for it's sequel was huge. Could a nine year wait really have deflated excitement, from fans, that much?! Other film series have had similar delays (like the waits for the first 'TERMINATOR' and 'ALIEN' sequels). Regardless of why the theater turnout was so low, or how it got somewhat weak reviews, it's still a great movie and I'm sure it will become a cult classic! The visuals are, once again, breathtaking and while it's very similar (in style) to the original, it's still like nothing else you've seen (in movies) in the last nine years. I was intrigued and entertained by every minute of it. It's the perfect homage to film noir and grindhouse filmmaking alike, like the original one. I can't see why any 'SIN CITY' fan wouldn't love it.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: youtu.be/tlKg1V_0fqE",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For

Sin City was one of my favorite movies of the 2000s. A fun, creative film noir cartoon with unique visuals and a style all its own. The first problem you run into with this sequel is that it offers nothing new. It's a stylistic retread of the first movie, only less impressive. The visuals copy the first movie but somehow seem cheaper. The makeup effects aren't as good either, with Marv's jaw easily twice the size of the last movie. The action is weaker, with no memorable sequences and a final showdown that is derivative of the first movie. The other big problem is that the writing is very poor this time and the stories don't flow well together.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
26,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Doesn't quite hit the mark of the first one, but still a distinctive, impressive experience",7,4 September 2014,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningNearly ten years after the last film, this long awaited sequel takes us back to Frank Miller's dark, grey and white hellhole city, and reintroduces us to Marv (Mickey Rourke), the bruised and battered anti- hero who spends his nights lusting after stripper Nancy (Jessica Alba) in a saloon bar, who finds redemption after saving a homeless guy from some drunken college boys. Nancy herself is a tormented soul, still having visions of her departed hero Hartigan (Bruce Willis.) But this is the guy who saved her from the beastly son of Senator Roark (Powers Boothe), who's targeted her for revenge in place of him, and has also run chancer Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) out of town. Meanwhile, there's the tale of the temptress the titular suffix is referring to, Ava (Eva Green), who's got embittered tough guy Dwight (Josh Brolin) wrapped around her little finger.In an industry where the cash cow sequel is quickly churned out to a hugely successful film, writer/director duo Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez have shown admirable restraint, if nothing else, by making fans wait nearly a decade for this follow up to 2005's adaptation of Miller's graphic novel starring Bruce Willis, who has only intermittent moments this time round as a mere spook. Retaining the distinctively grey, bleary background look and not skimping any more on the brutal, blood splattered violence of the first film, the makers have delivered a film that has all the fundamentals right, but doesn't quite come together the way the original did.By making the fans wait so long, you would hope that the golden pair were trying to prepare something genuinely masterful, with every little cylinder firing just right, and the film doesn't shatter this illusion. The problem here may be over ambition, with a desire to recreate the flashy, comic book style of the novels coming at the expense of a truly coherent, at times even logical story. While the atmosphere, the low pitched, gravelly delivery of the dialogue and the moodily grey and black settings still carry it along nicely, without a solid structure at the heart of it, after a while it all gets a bit too much.For all this, though, the characters, the driving force of the film, are no less engaging. Brolin is a suitably picked lead tough guy, who does the whole mumbling, brooding thing just brilliantly, who has perfect support with Rourke as his cohort. Probably most impressive is once again Boothe as the sinister, evil villain, who does cold and icy just great. The only thing that lets everything on the surface down is the misfiring Pulp Fiction style narrative structure, the one spanner in the works in what is otherwise still an exhilarating, distinctive experience unlike any other. ***",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
27,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Deleted scenes.,6,29 December 2020,"In a way, 'Sin City: A Dame To Kill For (2014)' is essentially more of the same, a follow-up to the visually arresting but ultimately somewhat shallow 'Sin City (2005)' that acts both as a sequel (to Nancy and Hartigan's story) and a prequel (to Dwight and Marv's stories). Only two of the stories in this piece actually make an appearance in Miller's graphic novel series; one of them never made it to print and the other only exists to add a bit of unnecessary closure to one of the first movie's tales. It very much feels like sloppy seconds, content cut from the original either for the sake of time or quality. Don't get me wrong, the individual stories are decent; it's just that they're nowhere near as good as those that appeared in the picture's predecessor. Still, the majority of this movie is enjoyable for what it is. It still spews narration so hard-boiled it could crack your teeth and revels in its pseudo noir milieu without really feeling like a proper noir piece. It's visually distinct and generally well-achieved - although its much bigger budget isn't really all that evident. The main issue with it is that it's even more surface-level than its predecessor. It's typically an enjoyable experience, but it just doesn't have the same impact. Still, it works well as a piece of light, hyper-violent entertainment. Even though most of it feels as though it doesn't really amount to much, it can be a decent amount of fun when it's underway. 6/10",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
28,bowmanblue,Just doesn't quite work this time,7,26 December 2014,"Like many, I really enjoyed the original 'Sin City.' Okay, I have never read any of the comics that it's based on, so I can't really compare the two mediums. However, it just worked. The main stories intertwined and were brutally original as they depicted the lives of the inhabitants of the fictional 'Basin City.' In fact, the first film was so popular it's hard to believe it's taken nearly a decade to produce a sequel.But was it worth the wait? Well... sort of. I think that if the original Sin City didn't exist, this one 'Sin City: A Dame to Kill For' would have been hailed as the classic that that first one was. It's hard to describe what exactly is wrong with the sequel. It just has this vibe about it that says that something isn't quite right. And that's weird because it contains all the elements of the first one. Many of the central characters return this time round (notably Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis and Jessica Alba), but equally many of the others who were probably wanted couldn't make it for one reason or another – due to other commitments or sadly passing away during the gap between productions.The violence is also there. It was probably tempting to the film-makers to lower the graphic content of the film to attract a younger audience to the cinemas. Of course the general 'look and feel' of the film is kept identical (but then that's no guarantee of success – take 'The Spirit' for example!).For me, it was all about the dialogue. Everything seems really stilted, like the actors are just reading their lines directly from the comic material it was based on. There was one scene where I could practically see Mickey Rourke standing in a Hollywood sound studio while he read his lines and had them overlaid over the footage of his character walking the streets of Basin City.Sin City 2 isn't bad. Its major sin (no pun intended) is that the first one was so good. Therefore any sequel had too bigger mountain to climb to try and surpass it. To sum up... For fans of the original, they could probably watch Sin City many times and still enjoy it. As for the sequel... you could probably watch it every few years, but it would certainly never grace your TV screen as often as its predecessor.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
29,dromasca,graphic novel on screen,8,11 August 2017,"There are films based on graphic novels (comics books) heroes and action stories and the genre is flourishing making happy studios and fans of all ages. And there are the 'Sin City' films which are graphic novels on screens. 'Sin City: A Dame to Kill For' directed by Frank Miller (who also created the books that inspired them) and Robert Rodriguez is only the second in this genre. I liked it. I will try to explain the reasons and the difference.The first thing to notice with 'Sin City 2' (as for the first one almost one decade earlier) is that it does not pretend to be anything else that it is. It is a comics story which is directly designed for the big screen rather than for the paper support of the graphic novels. The story (there are actually three almost independent story threads) is simple and relies mostly on action. No psychological or character development is to be expected from its heroes, they are from the first time they appear on screen until the moment they die or the end of the movie (what comes first) 'The Drunken Righteous', 'The Dangerous Vamp', 'The Corrupt Senator','The Nice Face Gambler', etc. The actors either wear masks (Mickey Rourke) or they are their own masks (Jessica Alba, Bruce Willis, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Josh Brolin, Powers Boothe, Ray Liotta). Most of them create their own characters as graphical novel heroes. The only one who holds some mystery and hides - at least for some time - her real intentions is the character played by Eva Green. All seem to enjoy themselves greatly to be in the film.All this concept is supported by a superb cinematographic solution which places the actors on sets that seem to be drawn in comics style and uses mostly black-and-white with touches of selected colors as in the mid 20th century comics books combined with the cinema masterpieces of 'film noir' from the same period. The execution is perfect, and the action scenes not only support the stories but also create moments of aesthetic wonder and fit perfectly in the atmosphere. The concept and the execution make of 'Sin City: A Dame to Kill For' a rare combination of good entertainment and stylish cinema.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
30,ThomasDrufke,Ava Ava Ava,7,26 November 2014,"Because I waited for the Blu-Ray release to see this, I went in with much lower expectations than I had in the beginning of the year. And I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the film. Not only is the film visually stunning, but the performances were spot on. The first Sin City was great and immediately got my hopes up that this world can be used as a background for an ongoing franchise. It just seemed like the perfect stories to tell on the big screen. So the fact that we had to wait 9 years to see a sequel was pretty brutal.Let's face it, the star of the movie is Mickey Rourke but damn does Eva Green give a whale of a performance. Ava Lord was by far the best character in the film. She was the perfect mix of manipulative, sexy, and downright lovable. I love the way the filmmakers choose to only have small things have color, and Eva Green's stunning green eyes stood out every second she was on screen. The whole 'Dame to Kill For' segment was marvelous and truly gave us that Sin City flavor we had been missing for nearly a decade. Do I think the first and last segments were entirely necessary? No not at all. As much as I like Joseph Gordon-Levitt his character didn't need to be in the film. I almost felt like they were shoehorning in as many characters as possible with big name actors in order to gain box office. Unbelievably the film only brought in 40 million, way under what the original made.Josh Brolin made the most out of his character, especially with how memorable Clive Owen was originally in that role. But I cant say enough about Rourke as Marv. His opening monologue and basically every other scene with him was captivating. Which is why his scenes with Ava were incredible. And basically the only reason the Nancy scenes were watchable. And I do agree with the violence complaint. The film is already visually incredible, no need to throw in 100 head slices. I don't know exactly to rate a film that I thoroughly enjoyed but at the same time got frustrated with. If only I can buy just the Dame To Kill For segment.

While I saw it and didn't find it to be great, I had no problem with it. I actually enjoyed this one. I admit that its main problem is how confusing it is with the first movie. It actually has scenes that take place both before and after the original movie, so it's kind of like a ""The Godfather Part II"" thing. While that film obviously did it better, I really did like this. It helps that there are so many wonderful actors in this. I'm kind of a sucker for stuff with Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Christopher Lloyd. Wait, they were in ""Angels In The Outfield""! What a strange movie reunion.The film just looks beautiful. While I still like the first one better, it's great to see all this cool action and interesting scenarios play out. It's not as much an anthology series as the original film as the characters do interact with each other. It is less confusing that way. Still, the original was better done.

32,lesleyharris30,"All Style, No Thrills,",5,3 August 2016,"Sin City: A Dame to Kill For is a mediocre movie with a plot that is poorly developed, despite a very talented cast. It certainly still looks beautiful, the unique and stunning effects are just as good as the original Sin City, which perfectly conveys the gritty undertone of this crime infested area. However, the stories simply do not deliver this time, all three stories of the original are better than the three featured here. Each one felt as if it was cut short, having anti-climatic endings, feeling like we did not get a full view of the story. As well as that, it never shocks or surprises, there are no big moments, nothing to put you at the edge of your seat, any twists throughout are formulaic and expected. Dull, bland and lacking thrills, die hard fans of the first movie will probably still check it out, but Sin City: A Dame to Kill For is better off avoided. A continuation of the lives of several different people in Sin City, the crime infested town that is becoming more corrupt by the night.

I think I rated it a 12 on IMDb (no mean feat since the ratings only go up to 10) * I suppose -- and I am not happy about making this concession -- that if anyone on this sorry planet has the right to destroy the original by making a sequel which is so weak that it borders on caricature (worse, it suggests that the greatness of the original was accidental) it would be Rodriguez and Miller. And that's just what they did.* To say that Jessica Alba reprised her role from the original would be to mis-use the word ""reprise."" She best resembled an animated giff file.* leaving aside the terrible script, a script lacking even a hint of the nuance of the original, it bears remembering that the incredible Bruce Willis is not merely a major star on his own, he is (check the IMDb) an accomplished voice actor too. Therefore, the attempt to fill his shoes (er... narration track) with Josh Brolin is painfully uncomfortable from the start, and only gets worse as time goes on.* the only one having any fun here is Mickey Rourke, and I suspect that is because, unlike you and I, he is getting paid for this involvement.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For

Just not my thing,5,16 November 2014,"""Sin City's where you go in with your eyes open or you don't come out at all."" The hardened unforgiving residents of Sin City are back and this time they have to deal with outsiders. Gambler Johnny (Gordon-Levitt) shows up and joins a poker game with the wrong people. Ava (Green) is a beautiful woman who can manipulate any man she wants into doing anything she wants them to do. These and other stories come alive and prove that once again Sin City isn't a place you want to be. I have to start by saying that I wasn't a big fan of the first one. I thought it looked cool and was original but that was about it. It may be because I was never a huge comic book fan and all that was was a live action comic book. I wasn't looking forward to this one but sat down hoping I would be surprised. What I found was that this was just about the same as the first one. This movie looks very cool but I just had a hard time getting into it. I really think that fans of the first one will love this. I wasn't all that into the first one and I wasn't all that into this one. Overall, a movie that looks spectacular (amazing in 3D) but the visuals can only take things so far for me. Once again this is just a live action graphic novel, that just isn't my thing. I give this a C+.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
36,callanvass,Stylized violence makes this an entertaining ride,7,2 September 2014,"I haven't seen the original in quite a while and went in with relatively low expectations. I wouldn't say I was looking forward to it, but I wasn't dreading it either. Thanks to some solid storytelling and some terrific action scenes, I had a great time. Depending on how much violence you like, I'm guessing the violence and the artsy style will have movie fans divided. I enjoyed it and thought Robert Rodriguez did a tremendous job of directing the action. It can get a tad redundant after a while. I did think there were too many people being thrown out of windows, and there wasn't enough variety in certain places. That being said, he came through most of the time. The Black and White is always special, as was I'll go over the stories and performances.Marv (Mickey Rourke) is a loner, who has a habit of lending a helping hand to people who need to settle a score. Mickey Rourke was solid as a rock, as usual. I did think he had a bit too much screen time at certain points. That seemed to hinder some of the other characters, but he was a blast to watch. His character is a badass that is hard to dislike. My only other complaint is that his character needed a little more depth to it. Nancy (Jessica Alba) is a grieving stripper that is struggling to cope with the death of her lover Hartigan (Bruce Willis) She's wanted to get revenge on Senator Roark (Powers Boothe) , but has never had the courage to pull the trigger on him. She's also inadvertently being tormented by the spirit of Hartigan. I didn't think this story was fully fleshed out. It seemed to take a bit of a back seat to a couple other ones. Jessica Alba has always been amazing eye candy, but she is actually quite good in her role. She's improved a lot with her acting and gave a mature performance. She had the right amount of vulnerability to be sympathetic, I was impressed! A little more background of her hatred for Senator Roark would have been ideal to make this the great story it should have been. Bruce Willis has a glorified cameo. He shows up as a spirit, but not much else. A man has to pay the bills, though, just thought his role was very disappointing. Johnny (Gordon-Levitt) is a cocky gambler that doesn't know when to quit. He gets a bit too big for his britches when he decides to take on Senator Roarke in a card game. Johnny humiliates Roarke, but it comes with a price that may end up costing him his life. This was a straightforward, but entertaining story. It succumbs to the same thing Jessica Alba's story did, lack of depth. Take it for what it is and you should enjoy it. Gordon-Levitt is good in his role, but it's Powers Boothe that makes a big impression. He's always been an underrated bad guy, and he clearly had a blast playing this role. I did think it ended a tad abruptly, but that's a minor carp. Dwight McCarthy (Brolin) is a private detective, hoping to rid himself of a controversial past. After saving a hooker from a ruthless businessman (Liotta) he gets a phone call from an old flame (Eva Green) Ava claims she is in all kinds of trouble, but Dwight wants nothing to do with it due to past treachery from Ava. Dwight's curiosity takes over, but he runs into a massive chauffeur, Manute (Haysbert) Dwight gets beaten within an inch of his life. Dwight enlists the help of Marv, but Dwight can't resist Ava's seductive charms, leading Dwight down a path of rough sex, deception, and murder. Dwight barely survives and turns to an old pal, Gail (Dawson) , to fix him up in Old Town. Ava manages to seduce a witless detective (Meloni) and convince him to track down Dwight. This was the story that they focused on the most. It was very good for the most part and filled with great action, twists & turns, and neat storytelling. Brolin is replacing Clive Owen. While I don't remember very much from the first, Brolin did a fantastic job as the tortured detective. I felt his suffering and was able to empathize with him all the way. As good as he is, it's Eva Green's show. She absolutely nailed her part. I hate her, loved her, and got attracted to her at the same time. She's able to bring all these emotions out of you with her sexy and engaging show. Dennis Haysbert is fun to watch as a nasty chauffeur. Christopher Meloni plays the foolish detective well, while Piven has a very minor part. Last but not least, Rosario Dawson is sexy and fun in her role. Final Thoughts: A little more substance would have been good, but I can't deny that I had a good time at the movies. The terrific cast and the excellent action scenes help get this over the hump. I would say it's worth a watch in theaters. Now, I have to check out the first one again7.2/10",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For

Acting was OK, but i think this picture cost cheaper than the first part, because production values weren't that exciting or big, it's not really impressive movie from visual point. The best part of this picture was Mickey Rourke as Marv all other were just OK, nothing special.

39,Bored_Dragon,"Great, but still a copy",8,10 March 2018,"""A Dame to Kill For"" is in every way a copy of ""Sin City"", just telling a different story. The same team is ""behind the camera"", and in front of it part of the actors from the first movie reprise their roles, enriched with some other big names, such as Joseph Gordon-Levitt, magnificent Eva Green, Ray Liotta i Christopher Meloni. The only disappointment is recasting of Dwight, although Josh Brolin did a very good job. I consider ""Sin City"" one of the greatest movies of all time, so it could be assumed that this is a ten too. But it doesn't work like that. A perfect ten, in addition to quality in all aspects, must have something of its own, characteristic, something that stands out from the mass, which will be remembered and that will resist tooth of time. This movie, however good, is a copy of the first one that does not bring anything new and, even if it does not fall into oblivion, it will be remembered as a copy. Extremely good, maybe even as good as the original, but still a copy. I think its bad ratings are not based on objective quality, but on the disappointment of the spectators who expected to be blown away in the way that the first film did. But the same people who was amazed by ""Sin City"" in 2005 can hardly be amazed ten years later by exactly the same things. If they came out in reverse order it is possible that the ratings would be reversed too. Personally, I think that the film is top-notch in every way, but the effect of ""already seen"" affects me too, so I have to distance it from the original.8,5/10",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
40,ironhorse_iv,"This dame wasn't worth to kill for. Yet, it was somewhat entertaining. At least, it wasn't sin sh*tty.",7,2 October 2014,"Sin City is based on the comic book series by Frank Miller about a fictional city call Basin City AKA Sin City. The neo noir film tells the story of its inhabitants. At the time, 2005's Sin City was pretty original. It really stood out. The visuals were amazing. The film had a very striking look, with its saturated black -and-white images with occasional splatters of color in a 1:1 approximations largely computer-generated background. It was something to behold. Now it's too familiar. The film also had that absurd macho extreme violent narrating storytelling that remind you of the 1940s/1950s film noir. The film was so successful, that a sequel was a must. Too bad, the studio fail to strike when the iron is hot, due to a lot of conflicts with actors/producers/studios in production. It went through development hell, and got nine years later; after more than a decade full of different scripts, changes to the cast, and false starts. Some fans got tired waiting for a follow-up and moved on. When the sequel did came to, it didn't live up to the ideal image of what a movie that went through nine years of development should had been. The sequel, 'A Dame to kill for' was a bit repetitious and too gimmicky even for comic book standards. Like the last movie, Sin City has a number of sequences stories with recurring characters, although the protagonists vary from story to story. Additionally, some plot lines overlap or weave together in subtle ways. I have to say, they do this a lot better than the previous film. Since the books have not been published in chronological order. It's hard to say, if this movie is a sequel or prequel. The first story 'Just another Saturday Night' from the Booze, Broads, & Bullets, the sixth book in the comic series is a short story about Marv (Mickey Rourke) chasing down several young college men after witnessing them burning a homeless person. The story really doesn't serve any purpose, as it doesn't bookend the film, nor those events in the story, really affect the events of the others sequence. It's an awful attempt to relived the whole Hard Goodbye's amnesia angle from the last movie. The next story, The Long Bad Night (Part I & 2)"" was just written for the film by Miller, has a cocky young gambler, Johnny (Joseph Gordon Levitt), going after Senator Roark (Powers Boothe) in a backroom poker game. Very entertaining acting from both Joseph Gordon Levitt and Powers Boothe, here. Probably the best sequence in the film. The next story is 'A Dame to Kill For"" which serves as a prequel to the events of ""The Big Fat Kill"" of the last film, it's here, that Dwight McCarthy now played Josh Brolin, attempts to rescue his old love, Ava Lord (Eva Green) from what seem like abusive relationship, only to find out that he been framed for murder. This sequence has a lot of loose-ends. First off, the whole sub-plot of the two detectives, Mort (Christopher Meloni) and Bob (Jeremy Piven) really goes nowhere and there is no pay off for the time invested in them. You would have thought, there was going to be a Mort Vs Dwight stand-off, but sadly not. Second off, it doesn't match the canon of the first movie, with previous characters like Bob & Manute (Dennis Haysbert) supposedly getting killed off. Anyways, the acting is pretty mediocre, here. Eva Green is probably the best here, but she's clearly over-acting. Her nudity is scene stealing, a bit distracting. Even her poster's speaks controversy. The twist of the story lacks the surprise, when you had Eva Green play the character. Eva Green has been known to be typecast as Femme fatale in the past, and it kinda hurts the film. She been typecast as the villain as much as Juno Temple been typecast as a hooker. Clive Owen was supposed to reprise his role as Dwight (post-surgery) but due to scheduling conflicts, he didn't. Josh Brolin wore prosthetics to portray Post Surgery Dwight, and he looks silly as hell with the fake wig. Additionally, Dennis Haysbert takes over from Michael Clarke Duncan, who passed away before filming commenced. It was bit odd, having that character, back. I thought, maybe they could had cut him from the film for respect for Duncan. The last story in the film is ""Nancy's Last Dance"", set four years after ""That Yellow Bastard"", it has Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba) obsessed with getting revenge on Senator Roark, for having John Hartigan (Bruce Willis) commit suicide. Willis and Rouke look so wore down by aged, it's hard to believe that they supposed to look like 2005 selves, here. Jessica Alba looks like Edward Scissorhand with her awful make up. The whole thing is so laughable that I couldn't take it seriously. The movie ends with a lacking of a bookend. Visually, it's almost identical to the original Sin City, but as a new movie, it doesn't stand out enough to get new viewers in or catch the attention of old fans. I saw it in 3D, and I have to give the movie credit for its effects. It's beautiful to watch. Still, there were some really bad jarring over the top violent and nudity that come out being corny. The writing of Frank Miller for the sequel is just as good, but a lot of it, felt a bit rehashed. The Dwight story and the Nancy story were basically the same in the sense that both had Marv to help them break into a mansion and kill a bunch of people. Wish, they use the 'Hell and Back' love story or the three Blue Eyes short stories. Overall: Like Marv in the original Sin City; I'm asking myself, 'is this the best you can do, ya pansies?' It seem that the producers could had done better. There were a few flaws, but nothing that ruined the experience.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
41,tomgillespie2002,"With nine years of preparation, you would expect more",5,29 December 2014,"Taking an alarming nine years to reach the screen following it's successful predecessor, Sin City (2005), Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller bring back the filth-ridden, black-and-white mean streets of Basin City. The first film was a modest success both critically and commercially, but A Dame to Kill For underwhelmed at the box-office, and despite boasting another stellar cast, it's not difficult to see why. The likes of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Josh Brolin, and, most notably, Eva Green, have been brought in to freshen things up, but the film treads very similar grounds to what came years earlier, and the drama seems emptier now than it did before.Like last time, the film tells various intertwining stories. Marv (Mickey Rourke) wakes up in a car wreck surrounded by the dead bodies of frat boys. Unable to remember how he got there, he begins to re-trace his steps. A cocky young gambler, Johnny (Gordon-Levitt) arrives in town and immediately starts fleecing a joint of all it's money. Insisting that he is allowed into the high stakes game with his good luck charm Marcie (Julia Garner), Johnny finds himself pitted against the corrupt Senator Rourke (Powers Boothe), who he wipes the floor with. He is warned to leave town quickly lest he feel the Senator's wrath, but the arrogant young man decides to treat Marcie to a night on the town instead.Years before he had his face operated on to become Clive Owen in the first film, Dwight (now played by Josh Brolin) is a private investigator who we first meet spying on businessman Joey (Ray Liotta) and his young lover Sally (Juno Temple). He is called on by his old flame Ava Lord (Green) who claims she is being abused by her husband (Marton Csokas) and his bodyguard Manute (Dennis Haysbert, replacing the late Michael Clarke Duncan). Dwight cannot get her out of his head and employs Marv to help him on his rescue mission. Meanwhile, distraught at the suicide of John Hartigan (Bruce Willis), stripper Nancy (Jessica Alba) is drinking heavily and seeks revenge on the man who drove her former lover to kill himself, Senator Rourke.Nine years ago, Sin City was, visually, a jaw-dropping exercise in using real actors against a green screen background. Nowadays, this effect is used commonly, even in TV shows, so it's a testament to Rodriguez (working as cinematographer) that the film still looks absolutely splendid. Beneath the beauty of it's exterior lies something all the more hollow, as the actors - the men and women - compete for the crown of being the hardest bastard with the graveliest voice. With such deliberately blunt dialogue, the film is basically made up of scenes of people acting tough to one another, usually resulting in machine-gun fire or somebody being punched through a window.The cast all deliver though, and although it's nice to see Powers Booth get the screen-time he deserves (his Cy Tolliver in HBO's Deadwood is still one of the my all-time favourite TV villains), Eva Green walks away with the movie. Embodying all the traits of the great screen femme fatales, she is allowed to go further than the stars that came before for her and be that more sexier, revealing all to Rodriguez's obviously admiring camera. She seduces every man she comes across, including Christopher Meloni's lovestruck cop, who fall at her knees, and it's not hard to see why. Green single- handedly saves this film from becoming a nihilistic and empty exercise in violence, which was fun and fresh the first time around, but with nine years of preparation, you would expect more.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
42,Floated2,Midly Entertaining but not as Good As the Original,6,16 December 2014,"Sin City: A Dame To Kill For is the sequel to the highly acclaimed Sin City, released in 2005. There's a certain high mindedness behind the ultra-violence. As with the first Sin City from 2005, Robert Rodriguez is very consciously offering homage to the noir films of the 30s and 40s. And yet, for all his love of the form, he demonstrates a tin ear for the qualities separating true noir from mere pulp: beneath the clichés, the great exemplars of the genre had serious things to say about the human condition, the ways in which good people can end up in bad places.Sin City 2 in contrast is mostly concerned with shooting, stripping and random eye-gouging. Three stories are loosely interwoven. Josh Brolin's private detective McCarthy (played by Clive Owen in the original Sin City) is seduced, then betrayed by Ava (Eva Green), a milky skinned demon-babe whose chief pastime is lounging around in varying degrees of undress. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is there to do well skating by his supernatural poker skills. And, in the only explicit continuation from its predecessor, erotic dancer Nancy (Jessica Alba) ropes protean lunk Marv (Mickey Rourke) into her plan to extract revenge on brutal city boss Roark. This sequel has definitely lacked the magic from the first one, and it is obvious from the comparison's.

43,leplatypus,Not a movie to kill for (web),4,1 March 2015,"Well i like reading Sin City comics and the first movie was excellent. My expectations was all the more high here that this is the best volume in the series. Now, i'm hugely disappointed and it's a bit strange as it's the same team behind the two movies and it took nearly a decade to do the sequel ! My first complain is about the editing of the stories. If i remember well, in the first movie, each short story was told as a block : start-middle-end. Here, those short stories surround the big story so it's silly in dramatic power. Next, their content aren't punchy : another Saturday night fails in fun, the cards player is long and dull to achieve nothing, Nancy's revenge is too simplistic. In that light, Dame story has the real stuff all the more than the movie voice-over reads the comics text. However, the segment is a total failure as the casting is really awful : first, Dwight is a bald, athletic kind of gymnast. To pick Brolin is to choose a bear instead. Then, Ava is a dark lethal goddess and to pick Green is to choose a cheap incarnation. In no way, Green could pass like a femme fatal and it's not a question of nudity. At the end, all the stories have defects and i must conclude that the movie has spoiled everything !!!",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
44,leonblackwood,Sketchy storyline! 4/10,4,20 December 2014,"Review: I'm really in two minds about this film because I stayed interested throughout, but when the movie had finished I couldn't remember what I had watched. There is about 3 story lines going on at once and none of them end that impressively. The worst storyline had to be Joseph Gordon-Levitt's, who played the gangsters son, because it seemed a bit pointless. You also have the weird story about Josh Brolin falling for his old lover and getting double crossed to take out her husband. That storyline also seemed to end abruptly without any join to the rest of the movie. You also have this scene with Ray Liotta and his mistress which doesn't go anywhere at all and you have the core storyline about Jessica Alba revenging the death of her lover, Bruce Willis, which is from the first movie but I honestly can't remember what happened. I knew that this film was going to be sketchy, right from the beginning when Mickey Rourke is suffering from amnesia but he can remember all of the gang signs in his old neighbourhood. I wasn't a big fan of the look of the first film but this one isn't too bad and the action scenes were pretty good. In all, the storyline is really patchy and the film seemed like various sketches more than a whole movie. The director could have easily split the different story lines into there own movies, which would have been a much better idea in my opinion. Watchable!Round-Up: Like the first movie in this franchise, Mickey Rourke is the best thing in it. I also liked Eva Green, who always puts in an airy performance like in most of her movies, but the film isn't pieced together that well. It would have been much better if the different story lines joined together at the end but the director chose to split them up, which was a bad idea. Judging by the box office takings, the audiences also wasn't that impressed with this sequel, which isn't surprising because it's all over the place. The acting from all of the cast was pretty good so the fault completely lies with the director.Budget: $65million Worldwide Gross: $39.4millionI recommend this movie to people who are familiar with the first movie in this franchise and who are into there action/thrillers based on revenge and deceit. 4/10",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
45,Movie_Muse_Reviews,A complete and utter disappointment after nearly a decade of waiting,4,10 December 2014,"Robert Rodriguez wowed all kinds of moviegoers in 2005 when he brought Frank Miller's ""Sin City"" to life with a unique visual flair that honored the graphic novels. For years, moviegoers clamored to return to Basin City, and nearly a decade later, finally got their wish. It seems, however, that nine years is too late — Rodriguez has reduced this once promising franchise to the mindless pulp of his ""Machete"" films and other recent efforts, while still trying to make a worthy sequel to the original hit that never quite connects.Like the original movie, ""Sin City: A Dame to Kill For"" interweaves a few disparate but connected plot lines into one film: a talented gambler named Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) pushes his luck against Sin City's powerful Senator Roark (Powers Boothe); Dwight (Josh Brolin in the role originated by Clive Owen) gets entangled in the schemes of an old flame (Eva Green); and all the while dancer Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba) plots her revenge for the death of her beloved Hartigan (Bruce Willis) and Marv (Mickey Rourke) looks for bad dudes to mess up.The cohesion is really lacking in ""A Dame to Kill For,"" with no seemingly core narrative or logical stopping and starting place for each vignette. It would have been different if each little scene was totally captivating, but the tension isn't there. The magnetism of the writing, the stuff of great pulp fiction that made the original ""Sin City"" what it was, is inexplicably absent. It's just vapid noir styling.Perhaps the core of the issue is a lack of a main character. The film opens on Marv, the definite fan favorite, with Nancy floating in and out of various scenes at the saloon throughout the film. Gordon-Levitt's Johnny is easy to love but disappears for a huge portion of the film and Dwight's subplot has the most intrigue but he might be the least likable. It's a total hodgepodge. Even stylistically, ""A Dame to Kill For"" loses its edge. Rodriguez abandons any notion of subtlety. Every scene has some piece of color, completely deluding the artistic significance of using it in the first place. The violence also jumps between gruesome, bone-breaking physicality and purely unbelievable cartoonish gore. The latter discredits the former almost completely; once a film descends into camp it can't really climb back out. Rodriguez has definitely settled for camp.The film's performances give it enough value to pass for entertainment. Gordon-Levitt's charm suits him well in this role even if his subplot proves unsatisfying; Rourke fits Marv effortlessly; Brolin gives a dark complexity to Dwight; Green is able to make a performance in which she spends half her screen time nude into an alluring character whose power goes deeper than skin. Their challenges lie in Miller's misguided adaptation of his own work. The film's countless supporting roles fair no better.""Sin City: A Dame to Kill For"" isn't bad so much as a tremendous disappointment after a nine- year wait. If it had completely severed itself from the original, the comparison wouldn't be warranted, but there's enough direct sequel material that it should, in theory, live up to the style and gravitas of that film. Instead, Rodriguez looks to have phoned it in just to give fans what the satisfaction of a sequel. Maybe this film would've been more passable if it came out in 2007 or 2008, but after so long a wait, it can't be considered a worthy follow-up. Some of that is obviously due to the novelty wearing off, but it shouldn't be this hard for Rodriguez to make a gritty, compelling noir film with a wild, savage unpredictable edge.~Steven CThanks for reading!

47,Vartiainen,Unfortunately they used all the best stories in the first one,7,17 April 2015,"Sin City: A Dame to Kill For is not a bad idea on paper. Frank Miller's Sin City universe is a rich and interesting setting, and as the first Sin City film proved, it translates to the silver screen beautifully. Unfortunately they decided to stick all the best stories into the first film, thus guaranteeing its success, but leaving the possible sequel without much material to use. Not that the stories used here are bad, they're just not as great as the ones used in the first one. Tellingly Miller was actually called back to write two new stories exclusively for the film. It shows.However, there is one exception. The story named A Dame to Kill For. Considered to be one of the better stories in the original comic books, it's a good thing they still had one such story to wrap their movie around. And it is awesome. Just as good as the stories in the original film with same great quality acting, hardcore action and brutal visuals. No complaints.The second adaptation story, Just Another Saturday Night, is really nothing more than an Ode to Marv (Mickey Rourke), and that's okay in my books. It doesn't have much of a plot, and the supporting characters are nonexistent, but it's a good opening piece.The Long Bad Night, the first of the new stories, works because of its actors. Both Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Powers Boothe have amazing screen presence and as they're pitted against one another throughout the night the stakes keep getting higher and higher, with satisfying results. A fine story and I could see this as an original Sin City story.Nancy's Last Dance, our last story, is unfortunately the weakest story by far. They clearly wanted to give Jessica Alba something more to chew with her character, but it just doesn't have that edge. You don't buy it. Still not awful, merely average.Aside from the material, the biggest problem is the common sequel problem where they want to do the same that worked so well in the original, but with more oomph. Here it means more colour spliced into the black-n-white, and it's very distracting. The original used colour carefully, for emphasis, for popping up important details. Here it seems that every single frame has a splotch of colour in it, usually for no reason, they just wanted colour in their frames. And thus the distinct visual style of Sin City is shattered.All in all Sin City: A Dame to Kill For is not a bad film by any means. It's disappointing, certainly, but only because I love the first film so much, and wanted more of that greatness, no matter how impossible it is to achieve. Still, a great movie to check out if you're a fan, but don't expect miracles.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
48,billcr12,Entertaining,7,27 September 2014,"This is pretty much a rehash of the original Sin City, with a similar black and white, film noir look. Mickey Rourke is back as a Marv, and once again he gets to kick ass and kill bad people. Jessica Alba returns as Nancy the stripper, who, unfortunately never takes her clothes off; a major disappointment for this viewer. We do get Eva Green appearing nude on a few memorable occasions. Her acting ability is not on par with the rest of the cast, but her spectacular body more than makes up for that. Bruce Willis has little screen time and Rosario Dawson is once again the leader of the killer prostitutes. The violence is comic book style and the story line not as good as the first film, but I was nevertheless entertained by the movie.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
49,BeneCumb,Stylish and vicious story with distinct performances,7,22 February 2015,"I am not very much into comics, and many movies based on them I have found incomprehensible and/or silly. Sin City ""1"" was the exception already - apparently due to the director and performances - and that is why I had at least similar hopes as for the sequel. Well, everything was far above average to me as well, the story slightly weaker though, but elaborated characters and good performances (both main and supporting) made A Dame to Kill For a good watch for me. Gloominess and morbidity were present, and a nice intertwining of events were catchy to follow; true, violence was often too playful (apparent references to Tarantino, Ritchie, etc.) and some scenes did not provide additional value to the movie, but there were witty twists, and the whole appropriate atmosphere was maintained until the end.Thus, I would not be so critical, and I liked it definitely more than e.g. Captain America or Green Hornet. There are too much single comic- based superheroes out there!",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For

I would say it is not better than the first Sin City, but it's almost on equal ground with it. Robert Rodriguez really shows in his directing, he has a great love for Frank Miller's story arc.It is quite has visually stunning has the first one, I believe this one takes it even further, cause it takes you in this world. Like the first one it tells the story separate tails. Joseph Gordon Levitt really shines here, Powers Booth who had a small role in the first film really has a big role in this film, and he really shines here. Jessica Alba also shines, playing more of a character then in the first one. Josh Brolin playing Dwight, who was played Clive Owen in the first one, although he was good, but plays it differently from Owen, really having it hard to believe it's the same character. Mickey Rourke returns has Marv, and i'm glad cause he own that role, and he looks like he is having the most fun. Eve Green is also good here. It has great action, that will make you jump.Michael Clarke Duncan 1957-2012 Brittany Murphy 1977-2009",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For

This is the second Sin City movie-the first was in 2005-that is based on the graphic novels written by Frank Miller. Frank is a co-director with Robert Rodriguez and they still use the black & white story telling, with splashes of color thrown in here and there. There are about four story lines that are told-3 prequels and 1 sequel-with Mickey as Marv, playing parts in all of them. Jessica is in the one that is a sequel, still dancing at the club, plotting her revenge on the senator-Powers Boothe-who caused Bruce Willis' death. And yes, Bruce does show up in this segment and it is explained how; remember, he died in the first one. Josh plays the Clive Owen part of Dwight, before he had his plastic surgery. Eva is the title character of a Dame to kill for and she is nude a lot-I'm not complaining, mind you, just stating the facts. It is a lot. Joseph is a gambler that takes the senator in a game of cards and then has to face the consequences. There are several cameos, as well as replacements in the cast. Two actors died in real life since the first movie came out; Brittany Murphy and Michael Clarke Duncan. Duncan's role is played by Dennis Haysbert, Aoki's role is played by Jamie Chung and Michael Madsen's role is played by Jeremy Piven. During the end credits is a Steven Tyler song called Skin City. I saw it in 3D and it was well worth it. It's rated ""R"" for violence, drug use, sexual situations-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 42 minutes. If you liked the first one, then you should enjoy this one. I did and I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For

It's about time that the movies started looking more like comic books, since Hollywood would have gone bust long ago without its constant transfusions from these first (and later from graphic novels). I remember watching DREAM OF A RAREBIT FIEND back in Aught Six and thinking, ""this is just like the comic strip, only better."" But in the 108 years since then, Tinsel Town has moved forward with merely the Tinsiest of baby steps. Sure, there's a few Megaplexes here and there with seats less tortuous for a 90-minute to 3-hour sit than your standard cell at Gitmo, but few hold a candle to the long-lost opera house venues that served up comfortable sits for RAREBIT FIEND way back when. Most Megaplexes today feature cans significantly larger than their smaller auditoriums. Instead of the tacky ""D-Box"" jerking seats they're currently pushing so hard (which pale in comparison to movie night at the Mechanical Bull Bar), why not kill two birds with one stone and put mini-screens in the john, so we could watch SIN CITY 3 from a pay stall?",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
53,alindsay-al,A below average sequel that should never have happened,4,22 August 2015,"9 years after the great sin city we have got a sequel the dame to kill for and I wish this film had stayed shelved. The premise of the film sees a man hell bent on revenge, a tricky card dealer trying to take on the system and a stripper hell bent on killing the man who ruined her life. Now Josh brolin plays dwight and does a decent job with what he is given I just didn't find his character to be that likable or interesting. Mickey Rourke is back as Marv and he is once again great in this role and just a full on badass. Joseph Gordon Levitt was great in this film and came across as a charismatic character that was completely likable even though his role was smaller then I hoped. Jessica alba is back as Nancy Callahan and she was a much more interesting character as she was messed up and no longer the damsel in distress but the hunter. Powers booth is the villain in this film and he was an awesome villain in this film and really helped up the rating for this film. The story I'm afraid though is just all over the place. Like the original sin city there are 3 different connecting stories but unlike the last one none of them are that interesting and quite forgettable. Also they don't get the same screen time so a few of the stories feel like they come out of left field. The script just doesn't have the impact the first one did and it didn't have the unintended humorous undertones this time round. The style of sin city is very interesting and dark and this film keeps some of these tones in the film. However, some of the CGI looks like it hasn't been finished and the action isn't that great. Overall this is a below average forgettable sequel that you don't need to see.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
54,estebangonzalez10,Doesn't come close to the first Sin City,6,25 November 2014,"""Sin City is where you go in with your eyes open, or you don't come out at all.""There has been a widespread claim that if you were a fan of the first film you will definitely love this sequel, but it wasn't the case for me. I called Sin City a masterpiece nine years ago when it first came out, but A Dame to Kill For doesn't even come close to that claim. One could argue and say that the novelty of these dark graphic novel adaptations has warn off considering that when Sin City first came out the visuals were groundbreaking unlike anything we had seen before. Perhaps it may have something to do with the fact that I haven't enjoyed the recent adaptations (the last one I really liked was 2009's Watchmen), but I know that my disappointment doesn't just come from this. A Dame to Kill For is as visually striking as the first film and it captures that pulpy film noir essence really well once again. What Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez don't do well however is build the suspense and connect the intertwining story lines like they did the first time. You have all these interesting characters returning and some new faces, but the stories didn't resonate with me this time around. Despite using the same formula and delivering in visuals and style, the three different story lines don't connect together. The film still has that same dark feel to it where it seems you are watching a comic book come to life, but the stories aren't as interesting and the narration isn't as gripping. So despite enjoying the visuals, this film was a huge disappointment for me and I don't think that the reason for it was that the novelty has worn off because it was the best aspect of this sequel.Most would agree that the best character in Sin City is Marv (Mickey Rourke) and thankfully we get a lot of him once again. The story is at its best when it centers around him. Some of the new characters were also fun to watch. Joseph Gordon Levitt as Johnny was one of my favorites in this sequel. His character is suave and cocky, but always fun. His scenes facing off the main villain played by Powers Boothe are the highlight of the film along with Marv. We also get a lot more scenes from Nancy (Jessica Alba) and this time she has more depth to her character as well. Josh Brolin also gives a solid performance as Dwight, but unfortunately his segment is the weakest. So we get all these cool characters and everything seems to be perfect once again, but somehow the stories don't intertwine as effectively as they did the first time. The stories aren't as shocking and they lack that emotional punch that Sin City delivered the first time. The film is gratuitously violent once again, but it isn't effective. The impact was missing. There were also several characters that took me out of the film. I loved Bruce Willis in the first film, but there was no need to include him here. He took me out of the movie. The longest segment in this film involving Josh Brolin and Eva Green was also the least interesting. Green has fun with her character once again like she did in the 300 sequel, but this time her storyline is way too familiar. All she does here is be nude and seduce men. The subplot where she seduces Christopher Meloni was completely unnecessary, as were his scenes with Jeremy Piven. So despite some of the interesting things that A Dame To Kill For had going for it, it has several flaws which make the story drag at times. This is the sort of film in which you should be having fun, but I found myself bored with some of these segment. The narration might seem silly at times, but it worked the first time as a parody of noir films. This time it felt dull. I know my review sounds negative but it is because I expected a lot more from this sequel. I still had a fun time watching Marv once again, I also appreciated that Alba had more screen time, and loved the addition of Joseph Gordon-Levitt to the already incredible cast. Unfortunately there were some elements that didn't connect with me and the stories failed to fit together as they did the first time.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For

56,NateWatchesCoolMovies,"Doesn't capture the magic of the first, but still one kickass ride!",8,13 September 2015,"Robert Rodriguez's Sin City: A Dame To Kill for is not the sequel I had hoped for, and awaited for so long. Maybe it's because it's been nearly a decade after the fact, or maybe because so many of the performers had to be recast due to deaths or pregnancies, or just the fact that two out of the three main stories are new material written by Frank Miller for the film, and not classic volumes. I suspect it's a combination of those three reasons, and as a result we get a film that just doesn't quite capture that crazed, lightning in a bottle black fire and potency that the original had. Having said that, I still thought it was a kick ass ride, entertaining as hell, gorgeously shot, and with a cast for the ages. Josh Brolin plays pre Clive Owen Dwight solidly, in the best segment of the film, the titular Dame To Kill For. Now, while I think Brolin is a better actor than Owen by a country mile, there's something magical in Owen's portrayal that just made it more special than Josh's gruff turn. The performance of the film goes to an unbelievably sexy Eva Green, as the deeply evil, sadistic femme Fatale Ava Lord. Green has effortless sex appeal in spades, with raw talent to go with it, and she plays Ava to an effing dime, just like the sociopathic, slutty man eating, smirking hyena I remember from the book, like Lauren Bacall gone bad. Joseph Gordon Levitt stars in another segment as Johnnie, a hard luck gambling man who gets on the wrong side of Senator Roark, played with craggy grinning brutality by Powers Boothe. Boothe only got one brief but memorable scene in the first film, and Rodriguez wisely let's him clean house as the main villain. He brings an evil eyed, endlessly corrupt meanness to the role, the ultimate murdering psychopath politician, and commands every scene he's in like a grizzly bear terrorizing a summer camp mess hall. Levitt, who holds his own, just doesn't seem to fit the Sin City tone though, and I felt brought out if the movie whenever he spoke. Mickey Rourke returns as the face smashing, shot guzzling superhuman goon Marv, with the same energy he brought the first time around. Jessica Alba gets her own story of sickening revenge against Roark, aided by the ghost of her former protector, Detective John Hartigan (Bruce Willis appearing from beyond the grave). Dennis Haysbert is glaringly miscast as Manute, the hulking, eloquent mercenary previously played by Michael Clarke Duncan, and I was reminded of his 24 character every time he spoke (why couldn't they just get Tony Todd?!). There's nice work from Jeremy Piven, Ray Liotta, Juno Temple, Jamie Chung, Christopher Lloyd (!), Christopher Meloni, Rosario Dawson, Jamie King, Stacy Keach as Jabba The Hut, and more. As a Sin City film should, it looks breathtaking, some shots standing out as perfect to me: Green, naked, poised on a diving board with a giant silver dollar moon behind her, also a great hazy bar shot where she enters in a blue dress. I one day hope to see the other novels (especially Hell & Back, Wallace ftw!) turned into movies as well, but we will have to see. It's certainly not as amazing as it's predecessor, but it's still a damn good time at the movies, and fits nicely in the super stylized neo noir/horror genre.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
57,kluseba,This blockbuster brings back the magic of the brilliant original,9,28 August 2014,"The first ""Sin City"" was a revolutionary movie in my opinion in terms of its comic book style, violent film noir atmosphere and intriguing storytelling involving switches between several plot lines that were loosely bound together. While many mediocre American movies quickly got many unnecessary sequels, one of the very best Hollywood films of the past ten years had to wait more than nine years for its second strike to be released. This is also the reason for the rather disappointing sales figures as many younger fans of the original have grown older and forgotten about the first part, younger audiences might not have heard about the excellent original yet and worn-out superhero movies in the key of ""Guardians Of The Galaxy"" as well as the wave of exchangeable dystopian teenage flicks like ""Divergent"" are what younger audiences prefer to watch these days. Let me tell you that these people are missing out on a highly atmospheric, breathtaking and stylistic follow-up that brings back the magic of the original and only fails to beat it because this movie is slightly shorter and the four stories told in here are a little bit less original than the four ones told nine and a half years earlier. This being said, it would be a wise choice to watch the first movie again before you get to see its sequel because the new film refers to several events that have happened before in Sin City.The style and spirit of the movie has been copied many times after its original release in rather similar flicks like ""V for Vendetta"" (2006), ""Max Payne"" (2008) and ""The Spirit"" (2008) which just proves how influencing the original was. That's why the sequel feels a little bit like one has seen similar stuff before but let's not forget that this franchise is the one that started this whole unique extravagant comic book style. If you like the aforementioned movies, you will also adore this movie that is hold in classic black and white with a few colourful parts here and there that make stand out certain body parts or objects. I'm still fascinated by this classic and yet revolutionary way to design a movie. The sinister and often sarcastic stories, the excellent soundtrack and the bleak characters that all have their dark sides add much to the gripping atmosphere of the movie. Especially the actors are doing an outstanding job in this movie. Mickey Rourke convinces as brutal yet charming outlaw, Josh Brolin excels as broken man with a raw appearance but a soft core who definitely makes me forget that his character was performed by Clive Owen in the first film, Powers Boothe delivers as antisocial, corrupt and pitiless politician and Eva Green perfectly portrays the sexy yet evil miss misery. Even the secondary characters like the suicidal Jessica Alba, the silent beauty and elegant killing machine Jamie Chung or the short role of Bruce Willis as a desperate ghost or guardian angel can entirely convince. The cameos of Lady Gaga and other famous people are also a nice addition to this film. The clash of all these characters leads to many brutal yet artistic fight scenes where the blood is flowing, explicit but honestly passionate dialogues take place and several scenes including explicit yet elegant nudity are shown. This is a highly entertaining mixture including lots of black humour and sarcasm, tons of over-the-top action sequences, some moments filled with extreme emotions and a solid base of tension and a high dose of sex appeal. Weak or conservative minds as well as young children should therefor definitely avoid this movie. In the end, if you liked the original ""Sin City"", you will also like its high above average but not classic sequel ""Sin City: A Dame To Kill For"". If you haven't watched these movie, you have definitely missed out on two of the most atmospheric, original and vivid Hollywood movies of the past ten years. Go and correct your mistakes of the past now. Along with the experimental crazy ride filled with star actors that was Luc Besson's ""Lucy"", this is by far the best movie of the not-so-young year 2014 for me. This is the only current movie franchise I definitely want to carry on, no matter if the majority misjudges this excellent movie and prefers to watch its trendy fast-food cinema. This kind of art isn't for everyone and this is what makes this so unique.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
58,3xHCCH,Eva Green is the Personification of Sin,7,29 August 2014,"In 2005, a visually-arresting film brought a graphic novel to striking life. The first ""Sin City"" film was such a novel film experience. Shot in stark black and white with splashes of color, the stylized sex and violence it showed was nothing we have seen in a movie before. It had a memorable cast of over-the-top characters portrayed by big name stars Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Mickey Rourke, Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Benicio del Toro, Michael Clarke Duncan, among others.Nine long years after, the long-awaited sequel was finally made and released. ""Sin City: A Dame to Kill For"" has basically the same noir style we marveled at in the first film. This second installments gathers three main stories to tell us, those of Dwight (Josh Brolin) and his sexy Ava (Eva Green), the gambler Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and his lucky hand, and finally the stripper Nancy (Jessica Alba) and her old score to settle. The common character in the Dwight and Nancy stories was the friendly brute Marv (Mickey Rourke). While in the Johnny and Nancy story, the common denominator was the ruthlessly evil Senator Roark (Powers Boothe).From the first sequence with Marv chasing down four college kids to teach them a lesson, we know we are in for the same old treat of violence with which the first film held us in awe. The violence was hyperbolically cartoonish in style with the animated arrows and splattering fluorescent blood. But make no mistake, this film is gruesomely violent, complete with gouging out eyeballs, maiming faces and breaking fingers in stylistically close-up detail.The sex was definitely still there with Jessica Alba with her raunchy strip routines and Rosario Dawson with her all-leather dominatrix garb. But we already saw these in the first film. Here, this sex factor was amped up more thanks to the bold new presence of one Eva Green who blew all the other ladies in the cast away with her sensuous curves and sultry moves. Ava's seduction scenes ranged from nice and tender with Dwight, to rough with policeman Mort (Christopher Meloni). Note the remark of Mort's partner after their first meeting with Ava. It must hold true for all male audiences during her scenes as well. She is sin personified.It has admittedly been too long in between the first ""Sin City"" and its sequel. I cannot compare them anymore. I sort of get the feeling that the story transitions in the first film seemed very smooth and seamless. In this one, the stories Eva Green and Jessica Alba live up to the title of ""A Dame to Die For"" since they both dealt with fabulous femme fatales. The episode with Joseph Gordon-Levitt seemed out of place since he is clearly no dame. Nevertheless, the innovative electric cinematographic style and the cool acting performances which made the first film so unique and exciting still make this sequel very much worth the watch.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
59,Amari-Sali,"After 9 years the world is invited back into Sin City, and with very little having changed over 9 years, besides who is playing who, it makes for an odd viewing experience.",6,7 September 2014,"When Sin City came out back in 2005, it was a major hit. It had a lot of the who's who of action movies, excellent stories, and seemed to transcend being a bloody tale and actual was quality cinema. Jump ahead to 2014 and two of the first movie's actors have died, one got replaced, and honestly as you watch you almost feel like maybe you should have watched the first one again just to remind yourself of what is going on. Though the real question is: is Sin City: A Dame to Kill For worth the 9 year wait?Characters & StoryThe film mixes 2-3 short stories of which Marv (Mickey Rourke) is the one who connects all of them. Starting from worse story to best: you have Nancy's (Jessica Alba) story which deals with her wanting revenge for John Hartigan (Bruce Willis) death in the first movie, as well as what she went through as a kid; Johnny (Joseph Gordon- Levitt) going up against Senator Rorke (Powers Boothe) in order to not only best him, and embarrass him, but make him remember his existence; and then there is Dwight (Josh Brolin) and the femme fatal Ava Lord (Eva Green) who gets him mixed up in some serious drama. These combination of stories, which mostly take place in the present, though Dwight's in the past, all create a bloody tale in which mutilation and bullets are the mainstay.PraiseIf you are the type of person who likes loads of violence, a good amount of nudity, and that is all you really want is some violent bloody fantasy, then you'll love this movie. Especially if you are the type who love machismo men, who mostly look like action stars from the 80s and back, fighting it out, fist to face, gun in hand, or even with blade in hand. Then, when it comes to your women, you want them bad ass, but still made for male consumption. I'm talking about women who are either scantily clad or nude, the ones who no matter who dangerous they are, or seem, they never become equals to the men when it comes to story. If that is what you like, you'll love Sin City: A Dame to Kill For.But, sarcasm aside, when it comes to the film I must admit I did like Johnny's story going against Senator Rorke for what little edge Gordon-Levitt has as an actor, he uses it to his full capabilities. Then with Dwight and Ava's story, Green makes the perfect femme fatal and really plays up her sexuality to the point you may even feel seduced by her. And quite honestly, I feel that if more movies were willing to be VoD, and be less than 90 minutes, I think that story could have made a good mini-movie, with some things changed.CriticismHowever, largely you'll find in Sin City: A Dame to Kill For that all the compelling stories you may have expected to see, due to what we got in the original, are watered down to fit in more fight scenes and more sexual content. Of which both are shoved down your throat so much that pretty much a quarter of your way through the film you will be so desensitized to it that it makes the issues of the story blaring obvious.Take for example Jessica Alba, who is but a pretty face who hardly justifies such a large role in the film. If just because, even after 9 years, she hasn't proved herself to really be made to be anything besides the hot girlfriend. So with this meaty role, honestly it feels wasted on her. Especially since her role isn't a supporting one in the first movie, and while Marv tries to Nancy not seem like a tool, Alba's acting makes that situation a real uphill battle.Though it isn't just Nancy story which is an issue, but also trying to tie all three of the films stories with Marv in the middle. For while Marv remains an interesting character, he isn't so good that he can connect the horrible Nancy story, to the decent Johnny story, and then Dwight's and make it all seem like one coherent movie. For he isn't the star, he is a supporting player in each story.But perhaps one of the most glaring issues is that the story doesn't get better with time, if anything it starts at its peak, with Dwight and Ava, and gets progressively worse. For with Johnny and then Nancy's stories following, and them all not taking place simultaneously in the film, it makes it so you can clearly see the film degrade. To the point where the credits hit, you are glad it is over for you pretty much have been looking at your watch for a good hour or so.Overall: Skip ItUnless you really want to see what Eva Green's breasts looks like in 2014, or like seeing Black and White violence, I honestly don't know why you want to see this. It lacks the style and type of story which made the first film a hit, and really after 9 years this is truly a disappointment. To the point that it truly seems like the type of film which because a contract was signed, and there was an assumption money could be made, that is why it was released. Which would explain, at least in my area, why seeing this film in 2D was difficult. They probably knew it was bad so they opted for as many 3D showings as possible so it can make some sort of money.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
60,AudioFileZ,Weak Gratuitous Live/CGI Melee,4,3 September 2014,"This film is a mess. Gone is the feeling of inventiveness which propelled the original in this repeat. It's a watered-down sequel heavy with soft-porn celluloid CGI live comic strip visuals.. While the original seemed fresh, A Dame To Kill For outright fails.The concurrent stories are haphazardly strung and, plain, weak. Nothing here makes an impression other than leaving one feeling dirty and used for watching, feeling embarrassed even. Eva Green being nude more than not seemed mostly to shock, or, perhaps, ""hook"" adolescents. The sole interesting, semi-fresh, role would have to be the part played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character Johnny. As Brolin's reprisal of the Dwight character didn't really cut it, Johnny is the sole person one could invest in and root for. Though Gordon-Levitt stood out, he couldn't repair the mess.

61,jadepietro,Sins of the Fodder,3,28 August 2014,"This film is not recommended.Frank Miller's Sin City 2: A Dame to Kill For may seem like an excessively long title, but excessive and long do perfectly describe this film.Filmed in black and white, with spatters of killer red blood to give it some panache, the film is a stylish crime thriller with live action and graphic (as in novel and/or violence) effects. Similar to its 2005 predecessor (which I thoroughly enjoyed), but now lacking in its originality and inventiveness, Frank Miller's Sin City 2: A Dame to Kill seems like a cheap knock-off. Its homage to film noir, with its femme-fatales and tough guys, wears thin by its gory conclusion, even if the package looks swell. Evil is everywhere. After all, this is Sin City. The film's underlying sadism and misogyny is disguised by the film's surreal and artful use of stark black & white imagery with burst of color to accentuate every scene. Women remain highly sexualized beings, objects of desire. Men fall in the category of corrupt fools, desperate schmucks, romantic lugs, or bloodthirsty savages. Some of the same characters are back. Deformed goon Marv (Mickey Rourke), pitiful stripper Nancy (Jessica Alba), seedy PI and hero type Dwight (now played by Josh Brolin), prostitute and dominatrix Gail (Rosario Dawson), corrupt politician and main villain Senator Roarke (Powers Boothe), even dead dick (Bruce Willis) appears briefly. But their pulp fiction story lines are monotonous reminders of better told tales from the original source. New characters do enter the multi-story format: A young gambler (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), sexy slut Ava (Eva Green), who just can't keep her clothes on, and other unsavory characters come and go. Their stories give the film some needed energy, but most of the action is rather dull, even with the fancy facades.The excessive nudity and violence is the predominant shock factor in this genre. Blood and boobs reign supreme. In fact, Ms. Green's breasts have a life of their own. Her ample bosoms seem to have more screen time than the actress herself. (But who's complaining? Certainly not the intended audience of fan-boys and adolescents.)Directed by Mr. Miller himself and Robert Rodriguez, Frank Miller's Sin City 2: A Dame to Kill For is a pop extravaganza that implodes from its own excesses. Unlike its first incarnation which had an artistic execution and vision, this version is literally all execution without any artistic vision. The film's overall look has a flatness and artificiality, relying on garish make-up and far too many CGI visual tricks. Its narrative structure is as choppy as one of the film's Ninja Amazon killers. Frank Miller's Sin City 2: A Dame to Kill For just ain't any fun the second time around. Ultimately, this film parody becomes a parody onto itself. It tends to exhaust rather than exhilarate its movie-going audience.

62,Seraphion,A nice follow up from the 2005 predecessor,7,26 August 2014,"The movie starts with the prequel parts of the first movie. Marv who chases and kills four boys who torture bums outside of Kadie's. Back at Kadie's again, Marv still watches the stripper Nancy as Johnny arrives there and wins on the gambles, including over Senator Roark on poker. The senator gets back on him, but not killing him. Way back, a private eye Dwight saves a prostitute Sally from being killed. He then gets called to meet Ava at Kadie's, but her husband's bodyguard fetches her. Vexed, Dwight tries to get back at the bodyguards but he gets beaten down twice. He asks Marv for help and they plow their way up to Dwight killing Ava's husband. Turns out Ava sets up Dwight to kill her husband.She fails to kill Dwight afterward and Marv takes him away to Old Town. Dwight gets back on Ava. He gets discovered by Ava's bodyguard, but the Old Town girls have him backed up, and he's able to kill Ava. Back to Johnny, after getting his injuries fixed, he luckily gets a dollar from a waitress diner. He then goes back to win the slots and challenge Roark again. He taunts Roarkand gets shot in the head. Now the sequel part begins, Nancy reminisces about Hartigan, training and building up her nerves to avenge him. She sets her face up to have Marv as a back up. They both storm into Roark's place, where she then squares off the old vengeance.As the first movie did seven years ago, Sin City: A Dame To Kill For (2014) rolls out it's story not confined just in a single character as the focus. It has four major segments of shorter stories which are linked by having certain characters involved in some or all of them. Most of this movie is prequel parts to the Sin City (2005) movie, expanding the story backward.Quite the opposite from the other Frank Miller graphic novel adaptation of '300' stories, the action part in this movie is retaining preference of the less polished raw brutality to the stylized smooth sequencing action moves. The gun shootouts and fisted or bladed fights seem quite stupid as most of the enemies fall down easily or don't even retaliate at all. This keeps the comic aura very strong, compared to the slow motions used in 300 (2006) and 300: Rise Of An Empire (2014).The photography also still takes us back to the 2005 predecessor, maintaining the dominant black and white coloration and contrasting primary colors on smaller objects. What I really liked is the camera angling done on the driving scenes. The way I see it, it's combining techniques using a moving camera on a jimmy jib shooting a stationary car with a background of green screen. Add a heavy dose of visual effects and suitable footage for the green screen backdrop, and.voila, you get the strange stationary 3D feel.The acting is a great overall. Eva Green managed to maintain her cold ruthless look, succeeding in claiming a worthy spot among the other senior Sin City actors. Mickey Rourke still has his character's hard hitting action great to watch. Josh Brolin did a good job in portraying the character that Clive Owen already built in the first movie. Joseph Gordon-Levitt did also a nice job of acting although his character feels less significant.My verdict for Sin City: A Dame To Kill For (2014) is a nice 7 out of 10 score. A recommendation to go and see is a definite one from me, After the long pause from it's predecessor, this movie sure can do the satisfaction as it's a worthy follow up.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
63,rgkarim,"An Okay Sequel, but not as good as the first",7,24 August 2014,"Sin City, a place you go to run into trouble, a kingdom of breaking rules and embracing chaos, a place where the corrupt rule and the honorable fall. Such a world is inviting to so much mayhem, and entertained us so much years ago. My second review this weekend is on the second visual installment of Frank Miller's popular series on unlawful antics. The first feature brought an interesting and fun presentation that made such a dark world both humorous and engaging at the same time. Can a second installment produce similar results, or does yet another movie fall to the sequel syndrome and tarnish the quality. Like always the black and white spread of Sin City is incredibly designed, with the slums having a comic book gloss to it. The design team did it again, recreating the world to maintain the novel splendor Miller created for us, without changing too much. Key elements and details are brought to our attention in color, with all colors of red shining forth on the screen to represent the animosity of the town. It's vibrant and plain at the same time and helps you get into the spirit of a true crime film. Yet intermingled within the dark and sullen world is some more comical aspects in terms of the characters and blood. Many of the characers have a grotesque quality that paints them as a denizen of the city of evil, each quality perhaps representing the sin they most commit. Most of the looks are impressive, with the makeup and costumes sculpted into a look that is either unique, or stunning. Even when besmirched by artificial blood, the looks maintain their edge and continue to capture the essence of the character. Let's talk about the story of this movie next. The second installment starts with three unified tales each centered on one of our ""heroes"". After a brief opening though, the tales diverge and the audience watches each tale unfold, mostly isolated from the other. Fans of the first series will know all the references and relationship ties in the group, but newcomers will get a brief review to help them catch up. The story still maintains it's dark edge, with many of the optimistic qualities like hope, happiness, and justice pretty much absent in the entire film. It's still a tale of greed and revenge, where self control is a virtue that many of the denizens struggle with. Now if you like focusing on one character at a time, then you'll like this approach again, but this reviewer likes a little more connectivity between the characters in the grand scheme of things. Some of the tales were very rushed, with little happening in terms of plot development other than getting someone angry, or violently dismantling body guards in an overdramatic manner. Ludicrous action scenes attempt to support the story, but in truth it's merely another opening to spill more blood. While you do expect ridiculous amounts of gore in the series, the mindless slaughtering got a little stale for me by the end of the first tale. However, if you like over the top usage of suspension wires helping scantily clad women kill things, then more reason for you to go. However, what helped offset the split up stories for this reviewer were the characters that were stuck in this world. In particular was Marv played by the rough looking man himself Mickey Rourke. What is perhaps my favorite role he has ever played, Rourke brings life to some of the drab moments. A well placed line, an over the top stunt, and an attitude that is just overall entertaining. Rourke's roughness finally fits suit and thanks to makeup, makes him look strong and intimidating without looking like he needs a bath. His character is the most ""level headed of them all"" and has the most balance in terms of skills, bravado, and laughs. Josh Brolin does a decent job as well, his internal monologue perhaps the greatest in terms of explaining the story as well as describing internal strife. Brolin's desperado and solemn nature are perfect for this role, making the suffering of Dwight ever more alive. Mistress of evil Eva Green is back with her fiery charm, taking her ability to play a devious woman to a whole new level. Like always she has strategy on her side, her cold calculating mind and lack of compassion a perfect mix for the dame that runs the show. While a little more sexual than I would have liked, her character had all the qualities of being a powerful force not to be messed with. Biggest weakness for her character, not enough time in the movie and not enough time to cause some real havoc. Reprising their roles as Nancy and Hartigan, Jessica Alba and Bruce Willis are back with their same style. Alba's gorgeous as ever, and the woman has some sick dance moves that she graces the screen with. Her character is a little more silent and insane than I've seen, but she plays her role quite well. Willis is still as calm as ever, as is most of his roles, but sadly he gets gipped of screen time and any real dialogue. The rest of the cast is good, but I'm running out of space, so let's wrap this up. Sin City 2 is quite a tale that is meant for those who like the darker side of things. While there is not a uniform tale, it's got some good plot elements that may hook you into the characters. Action wise it's not the greatest, but the art style and humor associated with the series explain its ridiculousness. Is it worth a trip to the theater? I don't think so, especially not worth the 3-D price, so stay home and watch the first one if you need a fix.My scores for this film are:Action/Crime/Thriller: 7.5 Movie Overall: 6.5",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
64,brando647,A Major Disappointment for this Fan of the Original,5,10 July 2015,"I'm having a hard time determining what it was about SIN CITY: A DAME TO KILL FOR that didn't work for me. I love the original film and consider it one of my all-time favorites. It was slick, brutal and funny with killer performances from all involved and amazing visuals that brought the work of Frank Miller to life. As the release of the new film approached, I found that, despite my love for the original, I was getting excited for it. With a nearly ten-year gap, was it too little, too late from Robert Rodriguez? A DAME TO KILL FOR is another collection of stories from Basin (Sin) City based on the work of comic legend Frank Miller. The movie features returning character favorites while introducing some new faces (literally, in one case). A quick breakdown of the stories: Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a professional gambler with an almost supernatural streak of luck and intentions of getting in to the most dangerous poker game in Sin City; Dwight (Josh Brolin) is a private investigator who becomes involved with a beautiful client, a face from his past, where nothing is as it seems; and finally the third vignette is essentially closure to the Hartigan (Bruce Willis) tale from the first film. Following his suicide, Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba) has devolved in a drunken mess, planning her eventual revenge of the man who ruined her life: the most powerful man in Sin City, Senator Roark (Powers Boothe). The movie is again presented in the signature CG, film noir style as the first film.The first vignette and my personal favorite in the whole movie is ""The Long Bad Night"". Joseph Gordon-Levitt was totally game for his role in the film. He plays it larger than life; his character, Johnny, is arrogant and confident in a way that almost annoyed me at first but, when I figured out what his endgame was, began to enjoy it. He's a professional gambler. His hands are near magical when their bouncing lucky coins or dealing a hand of poker. He meets the beautiful Marcie (Julia Garner), a full-color angel in a world of black and white, and invites her along on his ride. He wants in on Senator Roark's private card game. He knows the risks but he's hell-bent on getting this man's attention. Our question is ""Why?"" and we'll eventually learn what led this plucky gambler, seeming almost out of place in this town, to cross such a deadly enemy.The second tale is the longest and, sadly, the film's weak point in my opinion. The titular story, ""A Dame to Kill For"" sets the foundation for the Clive Owen segment of the first movie. Josh Brolin assumes the role previously held by Owen for the story of what led to Dwight's new face at the start of 2005's SIN CITY. Dwight is approached by a former lover, Ava Lord (the ever-beautiful Eva Green), who begs for his help in dealing with her abusive husband. She sways him with tales of his controlling methods and the constant presence of the stoic brute Manute (Dennis Haysbert assuming the role originally held by Michael Clarke-Duncan) at her side. Dwight eventually agrees, unable to resist her beauty, and finds himself a pawn in a more sinister game. My problem with ""A Dame to Kill For"" is that I saw every plot turn before it happened. It felt like a more typical film noir, loaded with the usual clichés, and failed to surprise me even once. If this were one of the smaller stories in the film, it wouldn't be a problem but this story is the bulk of the film. The performances are solid, no doubt about it (particularly Green) but there was nothing special brought to the table. If I had to single out the one factor of A DAME TO KILL FOR that didn't work, it would probably bewell""A Dame to Kill For.""Finally, the movie closes out with Nancy Callahan. In ""Nancy's Last Dance"", she finally reaches her breaking point. She demands retribution against the man who destroyed her life and led the man she loved to eat a bullet. She's spent the time since his death guzzling booze and dancing at Kadie's Saloon to the usual rowdy crowd, while secretly building the strength to kill Senator Roark for everything he's done. Her mind snaps and the first thing she does is eliminate her own beauty so her appearance matches her broken, warped mind. Then she enlists the aid of everyone's favorite Sin City resident, Marv (Mickey Rourke), in one final assault. It's a simple story without much in the way of plot; it's just a straight-forward revenge mission. Marv is his usual fun self and a highlight of the movie, as he's scattered generously throughout each tale without actually having a story of his own this time around. Nancy isall right. I just continue to have a hard time buying Jessica Alba as a hard-boiled anything. She just doesn't have a natural toughness to her (at least one that doesn't translate to the screen) and every time she busts out in the gritty, noir dialogue of a tortured soul it just doesn't hit the mark for me. ""Nancy's Last Dance"" is fun and short, but there's not much meat there.Sadly, I won't be counting SIN CITY: A DAME TO KILL FOR as one of my favorites up there with the 2005 original. It's just nowhere near as strong. The stories are weaker, it doesn't have the memorable characters (I still remember the wickedness of the Yellow Bastard but I can't think of a single character here that will stick with me after ten years), and with few exceptions (Gordon-Levitt, Green, Rourke) the performances are nothing mind-blowing. SIN CITY is a hyper-stylized, larger-than-life world and we need performances to match. There's no room for subtlety here; in the world of SIN CITY, subtlety is a weakness.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
65,moviexclusive,"Everything you love about 'Sin City', you will love about this sequel - and Eva Green is indeed a dame to kill for",7,23 August 2014,"Nine years is a long time to wait for a sequel, but in the case of Frank Miller's 'Sin City: A Dame to Kill For', it's as if it was just yesterday. Yes, fans will be glad to know that the years since have not dulled the sensibilities of Miller or his co-director Robert Rodriguez, both of whom have returned to script and helm this faithful sequel - and by faithful, we mean that it is just as hard-boiled, gory, garish and violent. In short, if you did not like the first one, then there's no reason you should bother with this.But for those who have been eagerly awaiting a return to the outlandishly scuzzy urban hellhole of Basin City (given the eponymous title for its collection of thugs, mugs, femme fatales and their criminal and moral misdeeds), you'll be glad to know that 'Sin City' is just as we had left it. Indeed, it picks up not long after where its predecessor left off, with one of the few good guys in the earlier film who was lucky enough to keep his head (pun intended) - the quintessential tough-guy of tough-guys in Basin City, Marv (Mickey Rourke).Marv narrates from a first-person perspective the prologue which is as much introduction as neophytes will get to this portrait of urban dystopia. Awakening on a deserted highway outside the city, Marv recalls his altercation with a group of frat boys beating up a wino before he blacked out and his subsequent return to Kadie's saloon, where he keeps an eye on its resident stripper Nancy (Jessica Alba) whose tragic past was the subject of the previous movie as well as whose obsession for vengeance bookends this current one.But Marv and Nancy ain't the only ones who are back; Senator Roark (Powers Boothe) returns to play the much-reviled villain of this chapter, the father of the notorious Yellow Bastard slain by Hartigan (Bruce Willis) before the latter met his own unfortunate death which Nancy spends the last tale trying to avenge. It is Roark whom Joseph Gordon Levitt's brash hotshot Johnny confronts one night during the former's backroom poker game, his arrogance leading not just to his unceremonious downfall but also the death of an innocent dancer Goldie (Jaime King) whom he picks up at Kadie's.In between the two consecutive nights of poker which Johnny challenges Roark, Josh Brolin steps into the role which Clive Owen previous inhabited as private investigator Dwight McCarthy, whose former lover Ava (Eva Green) reaches out to save her from an abusive husband Damian (Marton Csokas) and his henchman named called Manute (Dennis Haysbert, who replaces the late Michael Clarke Duncan). As it turns out, Dwight is being played by the diabolical and seductive Ava, who as it turns out, is the titular dame that is easily the most compelling and intriguing object of this whole enterprise.We don't blame Dwight for not having the resolve to simply walk away from Ava; wielding femininity like a trap, she also ensnares deputy police chief Mort (Christopher Meloni), despite being forewarned by his associate Bob (Jeremy Piven). Dwight's subsequent journey of redemption offers a detour that brings back Rosario Dawson's Gail, madam to Old Town's band of lethal prostitutes, including the Japanese longbow- wielding assassin Miho (Jamie Chung, replacing the original's Devon Aoki). It's easy to take it for granted, but you have to give credit to Rodriguez for his sheer effort at reuniting such an ensemble group of cast and characters to ensure that his sequel does indeed feel, look and tell like one.In part of course that has to do with the way the 'Sin City' movies are structured; and like its predecessor, this one weaves several of Miller's lightly entangled tales into a larger narrative piece, with loose connections between the characters of each individual vignette. Of these, the centrepiece is also the most fascinating, in large part due to Green's scene-chewing performance in various states of undress - but nudity aside, she is sexy, funny, dangerous, wild and in two words, compulsively watchable.The suitably menacing Boothe is an excellent complement, singlehandedly the reason why the segment with Levitt as well as his showdown with Alba manage to pop off the screen. But it is still a weak finish, in part because Alba remains a pretty but pretty empty actress, unable to convey the angst and anger tormenting her character as she struggles to muster up the courage to pull that trigger on Roark despite seeing him every night at the club where she gyrates. Rourke plays the tough-guy with the soft spot like the back of his hand, but his on screen appearance still makes him one of the most iconic denizens of the city.And on their part, Rodriguez and Miller demonstrate the same faithfulness to the latter's illustrations, so that just like the last movie, this one unfolds in the same graphic-novelly way. The dynamic signature visuals are still intact - high-contrast black and white, with occasional splashes of saturated colour for emphasis - but so is the deliberately ham-fisted dialogue that is meant as a hark back to the neo-noir thrillers of the 1940s and 1950s. As we said before, in terms of style and tone, it is as if we never left 'Sin City' despite the nine-year gap.That may sadly not be enough to win over converts, as 'Sin City: A Dame to Kill For' may very well be a victim of its own predecessor's success which has inspired other such adaptations like '300', 'Sucker Punch' and even Miller's own 'The Spirit'. Yes, this sequel doesn't so much as improve on the earlier film as recreate and recapture the same noir-ish nihilism. No matter, familiarity after a close-to-a-decade absence still feels both fresh and comforting to us at the same time, and we suspect fans of 'Sin City' will feel likewise.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
66,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"The sin has dulled slightly, but ""A Dame to Kill For"" is still most definitely a worthy follow-up. Flawed... but enjoyable.",7,25 August 2014,"Sadly, at the time I write this, it has been confirmed that the long- awaited sequel ""Sin City: A Dame to Kill For"" is a tragic financial bomb domestically. And it does make me very sad, as someone who was an enormous fan of the original film when it came out years ago, and went on to become a massive fan of the comic-books that inspired it, even buying every trade-paperback release twice. Unfortunately, it looks like co-directors Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller waited a little to long to release this sequel, with a frankly bizarre, grating and laborious 9-year gap between films. (Which no doubt contributed to casual movie-goers skipping the sequel.)Nevertheless, the film deserves not to be judged on its financial situation, but on the quality of the finished product. And I am happy to report that, despite the sin dulling slightly and there being a fair abundance of issues with the film, it is able to overcome most of its problems, and emerge a very worthy follow-up to the incredible, visually arresting original. Flawed for sure. But still most definitely a worthy follow-up.Based predominately on four stories (including two from the original comics and two new stories written specifically for the film), we again follow a group of characters through loosely-connected story lines (well... for the most part), involving corruption, murder, sex, violence and vengeance. Including the centerpiece- the titular story ""A Dame to Kill For"", which is based on what I feel is probably one of more so-so entries in the ""Sin City"" yarns from the original comics. Not a bad story by any means. (In fact, it's a pretty-darned-good story on its own) But just lacking the punch and interest-factor of others. At least in my opinion.It would honestly eat up a lot of time and space in this review to summarize and review every story segment, so I'm just going to throw out my more basic overall thoughts. I feel the two new segments (""Nancy's Last Dance"" and ""The Long Bad Night"") are probably the weakest stories in the entire ""Sin City"" sage. (Counting both the comics and films) Now don't get me wrong- they aren't particularly bad or anything. In fact, there are a lot of things about them to like. (Including good performances and some great eye-candy.) But something about them was a bit off. I almost hate to use this word, but they felt more like fairly well-written pieces of ""fan-fiction"" than original Miller tales to me. They just lacked that zing that the other stories usually possess. The two adaptations (""A Dame to Kill For"" and ""Just Another Saturday Night"") fare better. Both are good representations of the comic, both are oozing with style and both work fairly well. Although as I mentioned above, I never quite liked ""Dame"" as much as some of the other stories. So all-in-all, I do have to say that the film's plot lines are lacking in comparison to the original film, though there is still some fun to be had with them.The performances are generally excellent for the material. As many have noted, Mickey Roarke steals the show once again as Marv- this time his role having been fairly significantly expanded. Also a joy are new cast members Josh Brolin (portraying ""Dwight"", a character first played by Clive Owen in the prior film) and Eva Green. Both give wonderful performances. Other roles by the likes of Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Jessica Alba are well-played, but not as fleshed out. Though there isn't really any sore-thumbs in the cast. Save for an awkward small role from Bruce Willis that left me scratching my head.All in all the production has stepped up. Visuals for the most part seem a bit more crisp and are nicely stylized. The stylized nature really pops and gives you a wonderful treat to behold. From the cool pops of certain colors, to the magnificent use of silhouetted images, everything is just fascinating and fun to watch. But I do have to complain about a few, well... terrible effects that pop up here and there. (Though thankfully not too often) Everything looks good for the most part, but a few questionable sequences just come off as cheap and lazy. (Anyone who has seen the released ""Marv's Rampage"" clip will know exactly what I'm talking about.) I also can't help but feel this film continues a trend I've noticed in co-director Robert Rodriguez's work... the fact that he seems to be getting a bit sloppy as time goes by. I think it's his over-reliance on technology and the simplicity that comes along with it, but his last few films have felt quite patchy and almost poorly thrown together. (Too many effects that are unneeded, too many edits, etc.)But despite those complaints, there's still plenty of fun to be had here. Performances and visuals are incredible, as they were in the first film. The stories, while a step-down, are still more-or-less interesting. And it left me wanting to see the rest of the stories adapted for the big screen. Though sadly it seems that may not happen now.I'm giving ""Sin City: A Dame to Kill For"" a pretty-good 7 out of 10. It's not perfect. In fact it's wildly flawed. But I couldn't help but dig it thanks to the actors involved and the crazy visual eye candy on- screen. Worth checking out for fans of the original, for sure!",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
67,quincytheodore,"Uninspiringly bland, but it does present more than one voluptuous dame. It's an utter hot mess, a mess nonetheless.",5,9 September 2014,"Bare tits and waggling ass, I couldn't believe I watched this on cinema. Sin City: A Dame to Kill For is a series of several short stories that loosely correlates the characters. Just like the prequel, the movie is almost completely in black and white, excluding some notable details. This noir comic inspired look director Frank Miller's signature look is undoubtedly unique. The stars are aplenty as well, however the movie unfortunately ends up being corny, ludicrous and hackneyed. It strikingly resembles 300 : Rise of An Empire, in which there's more sex and less content in a sequel.The story is done in old fashion crime thriller style, and it's mostly a continuation of the first Sin City. The long gap between the movies could alienate some viewers as some of the plot or characters may not be familiar to them. Regardless of the interval time, stories from this movie are not nearly as engaging. The culmination is a rather boring stroll through the city as characters come and go, but none of them brings any appeal aside from flashes of tits or tits wrapped in leather strip. This is odd since the cast consists of great actors and actresses.With Josh Brolin, Jessica Alba, Mickey Roarke and lots of others talent, this should be a captivating tale of a corrupt city. Yet, each story appears pointless. It's hard pressed not to wish for it to conclude and for the next one to begin only to be disappointed with the same bland effort. Characters don't stay long enough to make an impact, don't have any attraction or simply underutilized. Script is highly stylized with everyone narrating like they are writing a novel while fighting and bleeding, what leisure time they have. It's not entirely bad, but sometimes it becomes redundant and some of it can be easily translated to more visual performance considering the acting prowess of the cast.Graphic is exceptionally distinctive with deep focus on lighting and shadow contrast. It tries to bring the comic root, although at some scenes it just looks awkwardly unreal. Action is really silly, it reminds me of classic action or current Bollywood movie where the hero is suspended in mid-air while shooting. Decapitation and dismemberment are the norm, as well as display of unclothed bodies, and to the movie's credit, these are quite exquisite bodies, so the Mature rating is indeed adequately deserved.Aside from the blood, gore, and nudity, there's not much to Sin Cite: A Dame to Kill For. The plots are uninspiringly bland, but it does present more than one voluptuous dame. It's an utter hot mess a mess nonetheless.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
68,Sergeant_Tibbs,Uninspiring sequel doesn't recapture the spirit of the first.,5,29 September 2014,"Nine long years we've been waiting for this. I was huge on Sin City when it came out. To my impressionable 14 year old self, it was the epitome of cool and a hell of a thrill. I haven't necessarily soured on it since, though it has dropped off as a favourite. There's still a lot to admire, even past its entertainment value. I remember that word of the sequel was one of the main draws to me to IMDb which subsequently really changed my life. If I think about it too much, A Dame To Kill For is a painful disappointment. But it mostly illustrates what the first one did so right. Since then, we've had a slew of imitators, especially in the devil in disguise form of Zack Snyder. Sin City remains the finest example. I wanted to rate this higher since there were aspects I liked, but I just can't.If there's anything admirable about A Dame To Kill For it's that it holds its own ground in the style department for remaining to feel slick. Most of that is thanks to its quickfire editing that initially compensates for its lack of wit in the script department. I was actually really enjoying the film at first during its initial setups and I was wondering why it was getting so hated. By the time we're halfway through the uninspired, bloated and gruelling titular centrepiece the film really wore me thin. Of all things, I don't know where the acclaim for Eva Green is coming from, but maybe she's just loud enough to seem like a bright spark. While the first film's melodrama had tension and its violence had elegance, this has neither, and it captures none of the spirit of the original.It's not that recasting Owen for Brolin was a mistake, it's the writing had nothing to offer. Let alone the fact that the chronology of the characters gave me a headache, it just felt so aimless. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed Joseph Gordon Levitt's segment, but it's not necessarily a story that should be a highlight of a whole film. Despite the connections to Rourke, it just feels like a sampling of inconsequential stories, resulting in Sin City lite. Unfortunately Jessica Alba does not have the conviction to make this next evolution of Nancy work and the film ends up deflating by its end. Perhaps it could have helped to have spent less time on Dwight's story and more time on the other two, but I'm not sure it would've made that much of a difference. It's not really a waste of time but those nine years waiting certainly were. 5/10",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
69,Troy_Campbell,"Unoriginal, but still fun.",6,18 September 2014,"It's hard to believe that Sin City was released nine years ago. A trailblazer in the gritty, shadowy and gleefully violent subgenre of comic book adaptations, Robert Rodriguez's imaginative take on Frank Miller's source material was astonishing, and a sequel was thoroughly deserved. Alas, A Dame to Kill For is about 5-6 years too late and what was once ground breaking and edgy is now standard and soft. Repetitive, uninventive and a tad stale in parts, this follow-up is essentially a carbon copy that can't reach the glorious heights of the original. Yet, if judged on its own, there's enough B-grade joy on offer to ensure it's a passable popcorn flick if you have a couple of hours to waste. The noir-ish visuals are still beautifully gloomy – although the increased injection of colour is to its detriment – and the hyper-violence is fantastically excessive as expected. The cast are uniformly decent, with Eva Green particularly amazing as a scintillating femme fatale whilst Powers Boothe commands attention as the sneering, ferocious big bad and Mickey Rourke's Marv is again a darkly humorous highlight. Employing the same narrative formula of three separate stories rolled into one, the focus on Nancy's (Jessica Alba) revenge plot is misplaced and should have given way to Josh Brolin and Eva Green's dangerous liaison, which is criminally ended around the 70 minute mark. There is, however, a nice streak of pitch black comedy throughout the movie that lands a few nervous laughs, which Rodriguez/Miller deserve credit for. Inarguably a huge let down when placed by the side of its predecessor, but if pulpy, unhinged and stylishly gory flicks are your cup of tea, then this is worth a peek nevertheless.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
70,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,An okay sequel that falls short of the original's greatness.,6,19 June 2021,"Sin City: A Dame to Kill For is a sequel that tries living up to the original film it exists because of; unfortunately, outside the Dame to Kill For story itself, there's a lack of humanity that was present in the first film.This film does have the same punchy action of the first, but the recastings, the somewhat awkward retcons of the original movie and 'original' material doesn't have the same self-awareness of the original film.Sin City: A Dame to Kill For is still fun to be had, but it's not the classic kind of neo-noir that will live on for decades after its original release.This sequel to a classic gets 3/5 stars.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
71,brchthethird,Should please fans of the first one,7,14 December 2014,"It's been 9 years since the groundbreaking SIN CITY came out, and the question on a lot of people's minds is probably if it was worth the wait. There's been massive advancements in terms of special effects since then, so how does this long-awaited sequel compare? The answer might be a little disappointing, but in no way was this worth a 9-year wait. Still, I am big enough of a fan that it was exciting to visit this world again, filled with its seedy characters, and hopefully that will be enough to bring fans of the first one back. Like the first, this is a series of interconnected film noir stories that explore various inhabitants of the titular Sin City. This time, there are three of them: ""Just Another Saturday Night,"" ""The Big Score,"" and ""A Dame to Kill For."" In the first story, Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba) is still hasn't completely gotten over the death of Hartigan (Bruce Willis, who makes a few brief appearances as a figment of Nancy's imagination). She then teams up with Marv to take out Senator Rourke (Powers Boothe). In ""The Big Score,"" Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a really lucky gambler who ends up getting in over his head. And in the title story, Dwight (Josh Brolin) gets caught back in the snare of Ava Lord (Eva Green). All of these stories were basically of the same style as those in the first, but this time they felt less connected and woven together. In fact, I almost would have preferred seeing the stories separately and fleshed out a little more, because the only story which felt complete was the main one, which takes up about half of the 102-minute running time. It was also the best of the three, with Eva Green doing her best femme fatale and showing off her amazing body. None of the performances are what I would call great, but they weren't bad and generally fit the pulpy subject matter. There's also the issue of the gigantic cast. There were a lot of big names, but most of them amounted to little more than cameos. Part of me wishes that they come out with an extended version like they did with the first SIN CITY. Moving on to the visual effects, there wasn't really any change from the way it was done the first time, except the addition of 3D. I have to be honest here, everything looked fantastic and the level of detail and imagination that went into this was just as cool as it was the first time around, if a little unoriginal. Overall, this was a welcome return to the hard-boiled world of Sin City. They didn't really change anything or try something new, but it should be enough to please fans of the original. I certainly enjoyed it.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
72,drjgardner,Don't get your hopes up,4,26 August 2014,"I'm a big fan of Frank Miller's work, and ""Sin City"" (2005) and ""300"" (2006) are two of my favorite films. But just as the sequel ""300 Rise of an Empire"" disappointed, this sequel is not up to the original. In fact, it is so far from the original it's disturbing. There is nothing new here, and much of what made the original entertaining is missing as well. More problematic, everyone's voice seems the same.Some of the guest stars (Christopher Lloyd, Jeremy Priven, Chris Melonik, Jude Ciccolella) are on screen for such a short period of time it's a waste. Meanwhile, the bulk of the story revolves around John Brolin who doesn't have the charisma to carry the film, and Bruce Willis as a ghost is a waste of everyone's time. Jessica Alba has little to do except dance, which she does very well.If like me you're a fan of Miller's work you'll want to go see this, but don't get your hopes up too high.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
73,rockman182,Sin City: A Dame to Kill For (2014),7,18 May 2017,"Of course I was going to seize the opportunity to use this amazing poster of the gorgeous Eva Green for this post. I re-watched the first Sin City the other day and recalled how much I enjoyed the style and the different stories and characters portrayed in it. The sequel was a long time coming but when I initially saw it I thought it was rather disappointing and far off the standard of the first. I still kind of feel that way but hey I might as well share why this time.The sequel is shared in the same format as the first with a few stories, some take place prior to the events of the corresponding segments in the first film, others afterwards. There are character changes (most notably a switch of Josh Brolin for Clive Owen) but many from the first film return. There are also a few steamy addition like Jun Temple and the very SEXY Eva Green. I wasn't sure I wanted a sequel because like most sequels, I thought it would pale in comparison to the original. This is the case with this film.Some of the segments are entertaining. Others not so much. For all the style and blood and violence this film offers, the stories can't help but feel dull. The A Dane to Kill For segment was fabulous looking and so well performed by the sultry Eva Green, but the rest itself was overlong and dreary. The final segment and showdown between Nancy Callahan and Roark was also disappointing. The film and segments definitely could have used more thought out writing.The film is style stylistically excellent. Its a joy to look at on screen and still has an excellent comic book neo-noir feel to it. The bloody violence is still on point. The main pitfall is not being able to avoid to cap on the stories and brilliance in the stories of the first film. It wasn't without effort, but Robert Rodriguez has still yet to make a good sequel (at least in my honest opinion). Its still a decent to good film but it could have been much better.7/10",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
74,adamscastlevania2,This is no movie to kill for,6,18 December 2014,"(58%) How long is too long for a follow-on sequel? Five years? eight? I'd say it's when actors who appeared in the original have since sadly passed on (Brittany Murphy, Michael Clarke Duncan) being a good indicator that too long a span of time has gone by for a sequel to have any real chance of making a relevant impact with a constantly bombarded audience. The unique visual style, despite it working perfectly well, is no longer fresh, and besides that the grouping stories just aren't as strong or as well told as the original; and yet the more problematic issues surrounding the original (corny lines, overly cartoonish characters) are brought over leading to a movie that is without any doubt twice as flawed as its predecessor. This though isn't a total flop. The cast is as good as ever with Eva Green being pretty much perfect in her role, even if her numerous nude scenes almost appear to be in a pattern of clothed, nude, clothed, nude etc throughout the entire movie, with the main intention solely to spice up duller parts of the movie that have very little of anything else to offer. And despite all the bloodshed, boobs, and bullets this feels oddly tame and tepid as almost all the bite of the original just hasn't made its way over to this one. Overall this is just about worth a look for fans, but I can't say I ever really want to go back to Basin city ever again, which is a shame.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
75,RforFilm,Sin City: A Dame to Kill For is a ballet of noir and blood. Really good follow up.,8,24 August 2014,"If there is something that Hollywood has given to the overall art of storytelling, it is ""film noir"". With noir meaning black in French, film noir relates to a darker style that a movie, starting in the 1940s, would take to create crime dramas that would push everything. It could be the motivations of the villains from sexual desires to greed, it could relate to showing the corrupt nature in our heroes, and even the way the film would look, relying on deep shadows and black and white imagery. This style has influenced the modern day action/adventure genres and even the ones you wouldn't expect; comic book adaptations. At around the time film noir was making a presence in the art world, comic books had only just debut and for most of the twentieth century, were seen more as a novelty. The creative minds of Frank Miller and Alan Moore would prove critics wrong by applying darker approaches to Batman and their own creations. One of these creations is Sin City. This is one of the greatest graphic novels of all time, creating it's twisted city and showing stories from the bowls that live there. A movie adaptation got a bigger crowd following of the noir comic book and people have been demanding a sequel for a while. In comes Sin City: A Dame to Kill For. This is also based off of a graphic novel of the same name, though this one only adapts a few stories along with some from the first that didn't make it in to the original Sin City movie. So this is both a sequel and a prequel. So I can already tell that those that have not seen Sin City may be confused by what's going on in Sin City: A Dame to Kill For. The first story involves the ugly Marv (played by Mickey Rourke) who goes after four frat boys in retaliation for their ignorance on society and the homeless. The second has a young gambler Johnny (played by Joseph Gordon Levitt) hitting the jackpot and playing the roughest game of poker I've seen again corrupt senator Roarke. The third and main story had Dwight McCarthy (played by Josh Brolin) trying to work steady as a detective only to be haunted by his lover Lord (played by Eva Green) and her rise to power. The last story has stripper Nancy (played by Jessica Alba) still tormented over John Hartigan's (played by Bruce Willis) suicide and her fall into darkness to take revenge. Sin City: A Dame to Kill For is a ballet of noir and blood. The black and white imagery is just fantastic to look at, giving this movie an actual living comic book feel. The methods of kills and spills turn what would have been a gross violent story into something of beauty. It has to be seen to believe, but for obvious reasons, if your squeamish to the sight of excessive violence and constant nudity, your not going to like this movie. Every actor is in on the style, all playing their parts just as dark as the city is. The biggest steel is Eva Green's turn as the seducing Lord. She embodies what most men fear in women; the ability to turn heads, cut off heads, and not show any consistency in what she wants. Speaking of consistency, tone is something that isn't. Part of the story seems to give up and move on into the next without much rhyme. It can come off as boring, but it satisfied me.I'll give this eight black and white scars out of five. Sin City: A Dame to Kill For is a fun exercise in director Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller visions of how dark mankind can be. This was made for fans of the first movie and comics, but if you got the stomach for it, I would encourage you to take a glance into the world of Sin City.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
76,ivo-cobra8,Can't even hold a candle to the Original!,1,30 November 2015,"*SPOILERS* I love the original Frank Miller's Sin City (2005) you can even read my review I wrote about the original -- http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0401792/reviews-1956 Do I like this one? Nope! I dislike this movie, because we didn't need another sequel who ruined the original movie. That story/segment was a sequel. Certain segments are prequels, and others are sequels (like the Hartigan one...that one took place after the Bruce Willis/segment one in the first flick). This movie confused the hell out of me, with all those sequels and prequels like seriously. Mickey Rourke as Marv died in the original movie but in here he is alive why? Character Dwight McCarthy was replaced by actor Josh Brolin! But why? Clive Owen was just awesome actor, they did not need to cast other actor in it. The movie is too short! Jessica Alba is terrible as usual and she plays a stripper that doesn't strip in an R rated movie! The character Nancy Callahan is completely ruined suddenly she changed her hairs and she went on a deadly rampage against senator Rourke! Beating her self up and using Marv (Mickey Rourke) to help her killing Senator Rourke (Powers Boothe) stupid! This movie is stupid!!!!If you enjoyed, or loved the first one like I did, then you will no doubt enjoy this one. Only problem is, they have taken a look at what worked in Sin City and cloned it almost identically for this one. You will enjoy the film, but be left with a certain.. why didn't they broaden the already excellent comic book world they created, instead of simply repeating the first one. Wouldn't buy it, but definitely worth renting. I am sorry people I don't get this film at all? Why is Hartigan (Bruce Willis) back as a ghost? That is stupid why putting an awesome best character back in this movie as a ghost?! He was so awesome in this movie and this one he was ghost who did do nothing! ""Not even Eva Green's T*ts could save this movie...!"". Robert Rodriguez does more crap movies than he does good ones!.).This entry was by the numbers (and that's putting it kindly). It lacked the energy and pacing of the first film. The stories were pretty boring this time around (especially Joseph Gordon Levitt's 2 part story of 'he wins poker, spends money, gets beat up, gets more money, wins poker again, dies. The End'). Alba didn't have the acting chops to be the lead in her story, and Willis just looked bored. Why was deadly Miho replaced now by actress Jamie Chung when she was played by actress Devon Aoki (2 Fast 2 Furious) in the original Sin City?! Sounds like the sequel itself is a sin. One giant cinematic sin. This sequel sounds tired, lame, cheap and worst of all boring. I will not be watching this one anytime soon and I am glad it bombed.The replacement casting of Josh Brolin as Dwight in a story I never particularly enjoyed in the first place, the loss of both Brittany Murphy and Michael Clarke Duncan and the announcement of a new, Nancy-centric story only gave weight to my feelings of absolute dread as I glumly handed my money to the girl behind the counter. And yet, as the theater lights went dim, somewhere inside was this faint glimmer of hope, the remembrance of how deeply I loved the first one, a chill of long-buried anticipation I hadn't felt since Revenge of the Sith. That turned out great, right? Oh wait, no, it sucked.Overall: The best way to sum up A Dame to Kill For is ""direct to DVD."" Everything about it looks like a cheap, cash-grab knock-off of the original. It's not awful... it's just not Sin City.Sin City: A Dame to Kill For (also known as Frank Miller's Sin City: A Dame to Kill For) is a 2014 American 3D neo-noir crime action thriller anthology film and follow-up to the 2005 film Sin City.

77,fernandoschiavi,"The narrative lacks rhytim, but it's always great to walk the streets of Sin City and not know what to expect around every corner",7,15 May 2020,"Nine years after visually reinventing and presenting a new form of filming, directors Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller are reunited to adapt the graphic novel 'A Dame to Kill For' and also bringing elements of 'Just Another Saturday Night', a tale taken from Booze, Broads, & Bullets, sixth volume in the comic book series. Two stories are unpublished: 'The Long Bad Night' and 'Nancy's Last Dance'. Most of the cast returned to this sequence. Josh Brolin takes on the role of Dwight in Sin City 2, originally played by Clive Owen and Ava Lord, the title's Dame to Kill For - a role originally thought for Angelina Jolie - was played by Eva Green.After the death of John Hartigan (Bruce Willis), Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba) thinks only of revenge. She spends her nights dancing in the same bar, but now in the company of a bottle of drink, while taking courage to face the powerful Senator Roark (Powers Boothe). At the same time, Dwight (Josh Brolin) tries to help the enigmatic Ava (Eva Green) only to find himself betrayed once again by this fatal lady. Virtually destroyed, he will seek the help of Gail (Rosario Dawson) and his gang to face the beloved, while Nancy will have the support of Marv (Mickey Rourke).Just as it was in the first film, this new journey through Sin City maintains the structure adopted in the comics and is composed of small stories that are told in parallel and without worrying about chronology - that is why Marv (Mickey Rourke) is there. return. The script seeks to divide the story again into three main plots, trying to maintain continuity with the events of the previous film. The big problem with this sequence is that the directors create an evident problem of rhythm, putting the climax practically in the middle of the work. The main narrative arc, which gives the film its name, is resolved quickly, when it could have been fragmented and interspersed with the other stories. The end result sounds like a great collection that does not necessarily follow a line of reasoning.The short story that gives title to the film, 'The Dame to Kill For' is one of them and shows Dwight McCarthy who tries to forget his violent past, working as a private detective and leading a sober life. After saving the life of con artist Sally (Juno Temple) from being killed by businessman Joey (Ray Liotta), he receives a call from ex-lover Ava Lord, who had abandoned him four years earlier to be with a wealthy tycoon, Damian Lord (Marton Csokas). Ava Lord is a woman who, when she touches a man's heart, becomes her greatest desire. A predator that usually destroys lives, sometimes for power, sometimes for profit and sometimes for sport. Ava Lord knows this and uses her sex appeal to get everything she wants from men.The directors and the beautiful Eva Green manage to impress the scenes with sensuality, a factor amplified by the plans in which we see her portrayed as a goddess surrounded by a whole mystical atmosphere. But there will certainly be a lot of people in the cinema who will see just one more macho movie there, wanting to boycott the work, after all, nowadays if any material produced does not fit the politically correct, that is, a censorship endorsed by the majority of the artistic class worldwide, it is doomed to fail, at least by critics. This segment is, without a doubt, the most involving plot of the work and manages to keep us immersed and curious waiting for its conclusion. It is interesting the mystery that was built at the beginning, in which we did not know whether Ava was telling the truth or not. Ava's nature is built slowly by the work and is revealed to be harmful with the passing of minutes. The controlled use of color is present in the eyes and lips of the seductress. Afterwards, the viewer is anxious for Dwight's revenge with the help of Gail (Rosario Dawson) and the Old Town prostitutes. We see a plethora of knives piercing brains, swords severing heads and a lot of digital blood in the best 'Sin City' style.The segment 'The Long Bad Night' is one of the unpublished stories written by Miller especially for the film and that brings Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a mysterious young man who decides to show his poker talent at a table full of influential and dangerous people . In this plot we learn that Johnny has a personal difference with Senator Roark (Powers Boothe). This plot proves to be very interesting, but its outcome leaves something to be desired, making us wonder why Miller simply does not use the original material, instead of creating this new arc that starts well, but fails for repetition in its closure.'Nancy's Last Dance' shows Nancy Callahan suffering from deep depression over the death of John Hartigan, four years earlier. She is obsessed with getting revenge on Senator Roark, until with Marv's help, she invades the senator's house to kill him and to realize her revenge. Nancy's bow is interesting and is what closes the film, while still being interesting, even if predictable. Chosen to defend a plot of bitterness and revenge, all Jessica Alba can do is to force a face of suffering while babbling her dialogues. Still, we have excellent scenes in the mansion invasion and even in the final confrontation with Senator Roark.Time was one of the great enemies of The Dame to Kill For. The sequel happened too late to accompany the commotion generated by the first film, and too soon we tried to use nostalgia to its advantage. In addition, Rank Miller's script is simply unable to fill all the stories with enough content. They are fast, empty and pale before the central plot. 'Sin City, A Dame to Kill For brings us everything we love about the first one as fun dialogues, full of catch phrases, neo-noir mixed with graphic violence. Everything follows the same pattern. It is more of the same, with the difference that in this case the narrative lacks rhythm, as previously said, and the three stories are connected in some way, but they seem to be stories played at random many times. There are also no memorable and shocking scenes as in the first, perhaps due to the public being more accustomed to this type of violence in other productions in recent years.Obviously the technical part is once again impeccable, as well as the direction, but it no longer brings innovations. It is certainly a story that will please fans of comics, since again it is an almost literal transposition of the dialogues of comics to the cinema and fulfills its role of amusement. However, for the vast majority of the audience, those behind a consistent plot, characters with whom it is possible to root and get involved, the conclusion is somewhat frustrating. Either way, it's always great to walk the streets of Sin City and not know what to expect around every corner.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
78,agmoldham,No Wow factor,5,21 September 2014,"I'm comfortably of an age where I can remember going to see the first Sin City at the cinema. The follow up film had one major disadvantage to overcome. The visual style of the film was quite new for the first film and obviously A Dame to Kill for is very much in the same style.Most of the original cast in front and behind the camera are reunited. it's no doubt that they have a passion for Sin City. The biggest criticism you could level at the film is that it does look rather like a computer game at times. Anyway the film is quite short and follows similar plot themes as the first film. I find the violence very much like comic book violence, so it is unlikely to offend too many people even though it can be quite graphic at times. If you liked the first movie then it's more than likely you'll enjoy Dame to Kill for.

80,bryank-04844,"Sin City 2: A Dame to Kill For' is more or less the same outing as the first film, with the same kind of characters, violence, and humor.",7,12 August 2015,"Second verse, same as the first. It's been almost ten years since Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller brought us the noir-soaked graphic novels known to comic book fans around the world as 'Sin City', which was created by Miller himself. This seedy, ultra violent, and nasty underworld, where crime is rampant and the bad guys end up on top of this booze drenched and drug induced city is the backdrop for some of the most entertaining characters in ever to come out of a graphic novel.Much like the first film, this second outing spins a web of a few stories that all meet together at some point or another with returning characters and a few new ones, which still captures the true essence of the 1920's noir genre. The last film made almost $160 million, which is an excellent feat, considering the hardcore R rating due to the extreme violence, language, and nudity in these films, but also for it's impressive camera-work and cinematography, which director Robert Rodriguez plays three roles here again, which is director, editor, and cinematographer.Rodriguez uses the green screen here 100% with his actors, and uses a great technology that builds this city and props around them, while coating the image in a gritty black and white color scheme, while accenting certain mood colors, such as blues, greens, yellows, and the ever violent yet lovely color of red. You'll recognize right off the bat a large and tough man known as Marv (Mickey Rourke), who spends his days and evenings at the local rowdy saloon known as Kadies, where the beautiful exotic dancer Nancy (Jessica Alba) is making her money and still trying to get over the fact that the only man she ever loved, Hartigan (Bruce Willis), sacrificed his life for hers, in order to keep her safe from the truly evil political senator of Sin City known as Roark (Powers Boothe). But it's great to still see that Marv is beating the bloody hell out of thugs and corrupt cops as much as he drinks. But our first story really starts with newcomer Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a young hotshot gambler who never loses. He walks into Kadies, wins some money, woo's the local dancer Marcy (Julia Garner), and somehow eases his way in to the back room poker game with Senator Roark and his cronies. With his impressive poker skills and Marcy's beauty, Johnny empties Roark's poker winnings completely, but Johnny being the arrogant son-of-a-bitch that he is, he calls out Rourke in front of his men, which sets this story in motion and Johnny's life in danger. But let's move onto the main storyline of the film, which receives the title, 'A Dame To Kill For'. This story was in fact my favorite portion of Frank Miller's series of books set in 'Sin City', and is the perfect breed of evil, betrayal, and sex that brews the best of the noir genre.This story has to do with a succubus and black widow of a woman named Ava (Eva Green, PERFECT), who is so beautiful and seductive that no man on Earth could resist her temptation or charm. One of these men is Dwight (Josh Brolin, previously played by Clive Owen in the last film), who had a relationship with Ava that ended very badly several years prior. After the breakup, Dwight picked himself back up, got sober, and constantly reminds himself, he will never succumb to her calling. But this being Sin City and all, anything is possible and you can find anything in the back alleys of Sin City. That's when Ava calls up Dwight again, and like a puppy dog lovesick over their master, he runs to her when she calls. Not only does she ignite Dwight's loins again, but she also goes after a married cop (Christopher Meloni), and leaves her own husband (Marton Csokas) out to dry.It's with Green's performance that she is truly the best noir actress to ever grace the screen. Her beauty and sex appeal is off the charts, but when she turns on the violent side, you feel yourself get stung by her sharp needle, which will quickly kill you, but still leave you wanting more. It's a perfectly told story in the vein and style of the 1920's noir films. Other notable aspects of the film are the cameos by Jeremy Piven and the intense fight scene with Marv and Manute (Dennis Haysbert, originally played in the first film by Michael Clarke Duncan). Every hit, bone crunch, face smash, and gun fire packs a powerful punch, which might leave you looking at your own arms to see if you have any bruises. Possibly my favorite cameo came from Christopher Lloyd, who plays, well a mad scientist doctor. I feel like they could have made a movie about him alone.'Sin City 2: A Dame to Kill For' is more or less the same outing as the first film, with the same kind of characters, violence, and humor. But it's Eva Green that guides you through this dark and twisted world and leaves you satisfied once you emerge clean on the other side.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For

82,Geeky Randy,"Sequel or prequel or interquel—whatever you wanna call it, it's not as good as the original.",6,28 November 2014,"A sequel or prequel or interquel—whatever you wanna call it, SIN CITY: A DAME TO KILL FOR lacks the ambition, charisma and intensity of its groundbreaking 2005 predecessor. Is the poor reception of this follow-up the lack of interest after a nine-year gap, or does it have something to do with the overall quality? It could all be a matter of perception, but one can't deny that the recasts of some characters (particularly Bob and Miho; Manute is understandable, obviously, given the passing of Michael Clarke Duncan) and the unnecessary absence of others (particularly Becky; Shellie, again, is understandable given the passing of Brittany Murphy) contribute to the feeling that this may be a movie that was never meant to be. The titular ""yarn"" is not bad, but may have been more fitting if it has been included in the first film, and ""The Big Fat Kill"" moved to the second film. ""Just Another Saturday Night"" (a reference to the song?) is a good opener; while Powers Boothe and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are incredibly fun to watch gambling (for not just money, but also for pride, power and life) in the non-adapted original ""The Long Bad Night""; unfortunately, ""Nancy's Last Dance"" lacks the satisfaction it intends because it merges too much with ""Long Bad Night"", and it raises the question of why there is being so much closure when many of the SIN CITY stories have yet to be brought to screen.**½ (out of four)",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
83,skepticskeptical,"Less Color & Same Violence, therefore, Less Good",5,9 October 2015,"This sequel was not as good as the first Sin City, which may confirm what I said in my review of that film, that the value inhered primarily in the seductive use of color. There was less color in this sequel, so the film was less appealing. Otherwise, it may as well have been the same film. A collection of stories about people going out to kill other people and getting killed in the process. The same silvery black and white world of Sin punctuated by color, but a lot less color, as though this was produced on a tighter budget and in a shorter amount of time. Plus there was no novelty appeal, as in the first Sin City, when the idea was brand new.There were many scenes where I noticed that color could have been used effectively in this or that way but it was not. I would not watch this sequel again. Why?",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
84,0w0,A very dark (lol) action noir drama...,7,15 August 2020,"It's really a 'superhero movie' like those DC/Marvel movies in disguise... these people have super powers, but it isn't explicitly stated. The movie was also breathed-upon by Quentin Tarantino and it totally shows... this is a very 'Quentin Tarantino-esque' movie. It's filled with action, though there's a good amount of drama and story/plot mixed in so that you don't get numb to the bombardment of constant action. Each of the characters are heavily unique yet extremely stereotypically portrayed (for good reason). Overall it's a good film and eventhough this type of movie will only appeal to a small percentage of general audiences, I would recommend that you watch it at least once if you're not certain, as it is really a pretty good movie, especially given the unique artistic choice with the dark art style.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
85,cinematic_aficionado,"A great sequel (yes, they do exist)",7,28 August 2014,"Sin city is back and what a delight it was.Trending on a rather familiar path that of good versus the bad, in this instalment it seems is the turn of the romantics. Men of this city who are prepared to go all the way for the girls they like, even if it means death. On the exterior they might appear as rough and tough but they undoubtedly possess a tender side.However, in sin city there's more than romantic, kind hearted men. The other side is filthy rich, decadent people whose greed and pride has blinded then to the point where murder is routine if it means aims are achieved.The meeting point of good and evil is a strip joint where the girls are seen as angels by some and a piece of meat for others.With a look and feel very similar to the original, with its moody conversations, the seeking of pleasure, the highly artistic cinematography dealing with the filth of sin city in a game of life and death, this movie is a trip and a joy to watch.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
86,Rickting,"Sin City 2 lacks punch but still offers gritty, visually stunning comic book fun",6,29 December 2014,"After 9 years Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller finally made a sequel to their masterpiece from 2005, Sin City, and.... no-one went to see it. One of 2014's biggest and definitely the most surprising box office bomb, critics were also fairly unkind to the film. It's not as bad as some say it is, but it's best summed up as this: The Kick-Ass 2 of 2014. An enjoyable sequel which lacks the original's impact and misses the point, and struggles to hit a peak when the scene stealer from the first is off screen. In Sin City: A Dame To Kill For, we return to the nastiest, darkest and grittiest city in comic book movies for more brutal stories of justice, sin and moral corruption. In one Marv becomes an amnesiac, in another a cocky gambler finds himself in trouble when he beats the wrong man at poker, in another Nancy Callahan takes revenge on the man who caused the death of John Hartigan and another involves Dwight's encounter with a mysterious femme fatale played by Eva Green. What's noticeable about these stories? They emphasize action and that wasn't the point of the first.Sin City was a great film because of its emotional power and characterisation. Here, mostly we're getting black and white shapes beating each other up like some generic beat em up flash game with little subtlety or grace. The script sags in places and the film refuses to focus on developing its characters or some sort of emotional impact. It never goes into unwatchable territory, but it's just curiously flat some of the time and it's hard to understand why. All you know is you'd rather be watching the first movie. It's still visually mind blowing and has some beautiful shots. It's well acted by its ensemble cast with Mickey Rourke and Eva Green being the standouts. There are many different voice overs but the film manages never to feel pretentious. You'll likely find yourself moderately enjoying it throughout without ever being particularly interested in what's happening. It's pretty safe to say Sin City 3 will not be happening after this, but the legacy of the original has not been tarnished.6/10",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
87,PyroSikTh,Feels like a Knock-Off. Still somewhat Enjoyable,7,2 September 2014,"I figured I'd try and work out why nobody wants to see this. Nope. I'm still stumped. Okay, let me lay it out for you; A Dame to Kill For is nowhere near as good as the original Sin City. It was never going to be. For the first movie they selected Miller's best comics and adapted them together. At this point it starts feeling like they're scraping the barrel. A Dame to Kill For is the titular story and it takes up the majority of the movie. I mean, the whole movie was obviously conceived just to include that story. Of the other stories, one was a short introduction a la The Man in the original, and the other two were never even in the comics. It really shows as well, as one kind of ends up really pointless, and the other almost feels like a copy of the first half of A Dame to Kill For (yeah, in the same movie no less).Connectivity is also way down. One of the beauties of the first film was it's various connections all over the place, from Hartigan lurking behind Kevin, Marv marvelling at Nancy, the Roark brothers, The Man sharing an elevator with Becky, etc. etc. It was jam-packed full of little easter eggs for the eagle-eyed viewer. A Dame to Kill For has one connection - Marv in Katy's Bar. Much like the first film, Katy's Bar is a focal point for all the stories to get tied together. It's no different here, but in this case it's the only thing that ties them together by way of Marv. Marv frequents Katy's often, that's fairly obvious, so he makes a cameo in every story. That's literally all the connectivity there is.Recasts actually really hurt the movie for me as well. I know it's a small point, but I hate recasts. A Dame to Kill For took the biscuit in recasting numerous characters. Dwight is the big one, being played by Clive Owen originally, and Josh Brolin this time. I can go with it for the most part because of mention in the first film of Dwight's ""new face"", but even once the transformation happens, it's still Josh Brolin. Yeah okay, Clive Owen was meant to appear, but scheduling conflicts put a spanner in those works, forcing them to plaster Brolin in make-up instead (and still looking nothing like Clive Owen). Michael Clark Duncan (RIP) was the biggest loss for me. I'll give it to them, Dennis Haysbert is probably the best suited stand-in around for Michael Clark Duncan, what with being tall, black, and deep-voiced. However he lacked Clark Duncan's imposing stature, which really stung when A Dame to Kill For demands more from his character. You could believe Clark Duncan as an unrelenting brick wall laying down punches comparable to freight trains and atomic explosions. Dennis Haysbert, not so much. It's the best they could have possibly done though, so I can't criticise too harshly. Devon Aoki was also replaced by Jamie Chung, which wasn't that bad (still no spoken lines), but it was just like salt in the wound after the other two.The rest of actors fall strictly average I'm afraid. Mickey Rourke is fine enough, but as he pretty much just becomes a cameo character, he doesn't get the opportunity to explore Marv as much as he did before. Jessica Alba is as sexy as before, even when she pulls a Lisbeth Salander, but again her actual acting chops never particularly wow. She can't quite seem to balance the ""badass"" with the ""delicate flower"". Bruce Willis, Ray Liotta, Jeremy Piven, Christopher Lloyd, Jaime King, and Juno Temple are all made a big thing of in the opening credits, but actually amount to nothing as they make the odd small appearance here or there and that never results in anything. Joseph Gordan-Levitt completely owned his role as the lucky yet arrogant Johnny. It's just a shame he's burdened with the most pointless story. There's a lot of subtlety you could read into his performance, but it's so subtle that it's likely to go over everyone's head. Lady Gaga's appearance was actually surprisingly impressive too. I mean I was expecting it to be a cheap cameo with bad acting to boot, but she actually slotted in really well. Finally Eva Green. Oh Eva Green, I swear you only get cast in these movies because you don't mind getting completely naked on camera. I mean, she has an absolutely fine body so I can't complain too much, but her quality of acting here is nothing we haven't seen before from her, and that involuntary smirk is actually starting to get to me when she does it all the time. She's under threat of being typecast, and after her spectacular turn in Penny Dreadful I'd hate to see her wasted.A Dame to Kill For was still an enjoyable time at the movies, bringing the exact same style as the first film did. The visuals are beautiful, the jazz-inspired soundtrack is divine, the voice-over works a treat, and the violence and gore, sex and nudity are both turned up to eleven. However it's not without it's many faults. Despite only being an hour and a half, it starts to drag in the middle, the quality of storytelling has suffered a dip, and I'm still not quite sure of where it fits with the stories in the first film. It almost feels like a cheap knock-off. Even so, I still give A Dame to Kill For a good 7/10.http://qyrosmovies.blogspot.co.uk/",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
88,MattBrady099,A comic book come to life once again,5,5 December 2014,"Marv: ""That right there is a dame to kill for"". Okay this movie was hated by the critics and it flopped at the box office, and I don't see why to be honest. Some of the new stories were good and some of the new stories were pretty dull. Eva Green story was pretty forgettable and the movie ended not on a strong note. The Visual's this time are a lot better and it's good to see the characters from the first movie make a small return. Joseph Gordon-Levitt story was short but I still enjoyed it, even when it was brutal to watch at times.

89,Al_The_Strange,Sin City - A Dame To Kill For Review,8,15 September 2014,"So there I was, late summer of '14, I was just cruising around and I decide to catch this flick while I was all hyped. Why not? I thought the first Sin City was ace, so if this second one had just more of the same, I'd be golden.This sequel starts off kinda lousy, with a little ditty called Just Another Saturday Night. It pulls old Marv back into things (what the hell, I thought he was dead?). A bunch of stuff floats around the screen, Marv rambles on about beating up some punks. The film whips through all kinds of hoopla, before the main credits roll. I just hoped to God the whole thing didn't play as fast and loose as those first scenes.Thankfully, it doesn't. The film settles down to a slower, more even pace. Hell, it almost seems to drag. But in my eyes, I like the way it unfolds and the film keeps me hooked, like the sultry serenade of a siren. The Long Bad Night kicks off, showing a hotshot kid trying to win big at a poker game with the high hats. That bit gets interrupted by the main feature, A Dame To Kill For; Dwight in his younger days gets played by a dame that everybody seems to fall for. I got to admit, I fell for her watching this picture; that Eva Green sure is one hell of a babe. She's a looker alright, with or without clothes, and I loved watching her whether she was nice or naughty. The story ends in a bloodbath, before going back to The Long Bad Night. I was digging it, but the ending was lousy. Then, we see Nancy's Last Dance, where little Nancy Callahan is all grown up and out for blood. That's a story I could take or leave, but I saw other reviews saying it just wasn't right.So, the stories don't have all the same moxie as the first movie. There is some action, some blood, plenty of sexy dames, but it doesn't hit as hard. Some things between the two flicks don't match up right. But, I loved it all the same. The sequel keeps up the trend of showing tough guys and broads all caught up in the vices, the decadence, and the vicious cycles of Basin City, which feels more and more like some kind of expressionist hell. The tropes and clichés are all there, and there are familiar faces whether we like it or not. Vengeance, power, corruption, greed, lust, all the usual themes are there.The film looks nice and slick. Can't say the visuals are as punchy as the first flick, but it looks to me like they took what they had and made it better; the color effects, the green-screen stuff, the transitions and comic-book type of look is as clean and sharp as ever. Editing ain't too bad, although the cutting of the stories could arguably be better. The players are alright: I could probably watch Eva Green playing this bit all day long. Josh Brolin gets a lot of crap, because of the prosthetics and because he has some big shoes to fill after Clive Owen, but I didn't mind him one bit. Micky Roarke seems to be having a ball. He gets crap for his prosthetics too, but once again, I don't see what the beef is. I like Bruce Willis, but for all the time he's in this picture, I wonder what the point is. Jessica Alba is alright. I didn't mind most everybody else: Joseph Gordon Levitt fits in good, Powers Booth is ace, Ray Liotta is fine and dandy, Christopher Lloyd does okay, and I was digging the Lady GaGa cameo. If I have a problem with anything, it's wondering what Stacey Keach is doing here, looking like a giant heap under all that prosthetic crap when he didn't do much of anything, and I miss Devon Aoki as deadly little Miho (Jamie Chung isn't doing much for me). This picture has some nice-looking sets, props, costumes, and other goods. Music is really swingin'.So, it seems like lots of people have some kind of beef with the stories, the casting changes, the prosthetics, and God knows what else. I personally enjoyed the movie all the same. If you liked the first Sin City, then this should be worth checking out. Otherwise, don't bother.4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Stories: Pretty Good | Film: Pretty Good)",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
90,ArchonCinemaReviews,Exercise in futility,2,30 September 2014,"Almost ten years later, writer/directors Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller try to strike gold again with a second screen adaptation of the Sin City graphic novels.Unfortunately, A Dame to Kill For suffers from all the afflictions of a bad sequel: an overcomplicated plot forcing a resolved story forward, recasting of previous roles and the addition of new but significantly less compelling characters, and exploiting the spark that made the first film great while still not having that magical appeal.Once again we find ourselves in hardened and corrupted town of Basin City where the inhabitants exist and resist against the sinful city, while others revel in its reprehensible environment.Producers started working on a sequel seven years after the initial film was released. In that time Brittany Murphy and Michael Clarke Duncan passed. Though they portrayed minor characters, their characters, Shellie and Manute respectively, were vastly effectual and favorites in the film. Rodriguez elected to retire Shellie, smartly, but recast Manute with Dennis Haysbert, but he did not stop there. He also chose to recast Devon Aoki's Miho with the exceedingly inferior Jamie Chung and Michael Madsen's Bob with Jeremy Piven. Further, Clive Owen's Dwight McCarthy is seemingly recast and played by Josh Brolin. Mickey Rourke's Marv makes a surprise appearance considering he died in the previous film. Eye candy Jessica Alba dons the stirrups once again as Nancy but this time gets an unnecessary and boring principal role.It's almost impossible to write a summary for the film without giving away key aspects of the plot. Note, the term 'spoiler' was not used deliberately as nothing would be spoiled. Despite having several fascinating and explicit story lines from the comics, Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez decided to force five seemingly unconnected and irrelevant segments worth of content into a Sin City sequel that is really a pointless prequel-sequel hybrid. Within thirty minutes at least seven main characters and their associated stories, all in infancy, branch out with no time to become invested or even care about the outcome.The revolutionary awe and savagery of Sin City is gone. The inventive techniques that made the first film extraordinary are exploited and bludgeoned to death. Rodriguez and Miller over-utilize popping colors against the stylized black and white motif so that the significance in these items and moments diminishes to nothingness.The witty dialogue that succinctly dripped with a retro film noir edge falls flat on the tongue of the, arguably, main character portrayed by Josh Brolin. Brolin lacks the debonair and commanding force that Clive Owen has in the first film. Peppered with lazy and lame metaphors, the script sounds like the banal ramblings of a poorly followed twitter account of a desperate writer. Example: ""An atom bomb goes off between my legs. A freight train barrels into my jaw."" Then to keep up with the gruesome and shocking content of its predecessor, A Dame to Kill For randomly adds violence as an obvious afterthought.It is incomprehensible that, after seven years, the producers would rush into filming besides a hefty paycheck with this paltry, tame and inconsequential movie. A Dame to Kill For is painfully contrived and completely pointless.For more FULL reviews, please check out our website.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For

The original really felt like the comic was turned into a movie. Here it feels like the movie was turned into a comic. It isn't bad. People who say this is bad are actually critiquing Miller on which comic the story is based. Rodriguez only did the directing here. What happens is lack of style. It's still there, but only in little remains. Rodriguez acts like he is making another Machete, just with no humor. Violence is here, and boy does he not shy away from showing Eva Green naked. But, as a result, movie feels like any other movie, just with that comic aesthetic. It's still cool, and I would watch whatever is made in this style. But that's me. I get why people hate it. I think that lack of Quentin Tarantino as a guest director is really felt hard and probably his work at the first movie made it what it is. But I myself, who am on a holy mission to watch all bad, trash and exploitation movies am not, in this situation, concerned about the matters others are. Did I enjoy the movie? Yes I did!

95,p-jonsson,"Artistic, cartoonish violence",8,1 February 2015,"This is a movie that you have to really watch. You cannot sit and divide your time between the movie and reading a book or glancing at your tablet. Doing that would be like watching half a painting. This movie is all about the graphical presentation. Its use of live actors yet with a cartoonish black and white (emphasize on black) look with some occasional splatter of colors is absolutely marvelous. Look down and you miss something. The background voice a'la old fashioned detective story only serves to reinforce the feeling of being dumped into an old cartoon.The story, or rather stories, are cartoon class material as well and not really much to write home about by themselves. They serve well enough to drive this particular movie though. The main actors where fitting right in and making a very enjoyable performance as far as I am concerned. Well, with the possible exception of Bruce Willis who mostly just stood around looking sad but then his role was a rather unrewarding one in the first place. I definitely liked Mickey Rourke as the rather exaggerated tuff guy Marv.This is a violent movie. Like Kill Bill violent if you know what I mean. If this movie would have been made as an ordinary live action movie without the cartoonish elements and the timely switch to silhouette images it would be grossly violent. Again, the cartoonish setting of the movie makes it simply work. Still, the movie is not for the squeamish but then, this is the second Sin City movie, it is based on an existing cartoon and Robert Rodriguez had his hand in it so if you are surprised you either went into the wrong show room or should start to do a bit more research before deciding to watch something.I did find the fact that the movie actually revolved around two different stories a bit distracting though. A minor complaint but I was really expecting them to somehow get intertwined all through the movie and was a tad disappointed when the second story finished and so did the movie.Bottom line is that I quite enjoyed this movie. It is really a movie that stands out from the crowd in its use of black and white imagery and cartoon characters. It is black, grim and funny at the same time and for a photography interested person like me the imagery is really beautiful.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
96,Magow-Intermean,Sin City 2: A Dame To Kill For Review,9,25 March 2019,"It was another dark night in Basin City when lovers Dwight and Ava Lord were reunited. But in Sin City, a reunion is never good news. And Ava has plans for Dwight.
Back in 2005, Robert Rodriguez and graphic novel creator Frank Miller collaborated to bring Miller's noir-heavy tales of Sin City to the big screen. Despite the success of that film, it has taken them nearly a decade to wrangle the budget and cast together for a second shot. This time around, the pair have cherry-picked elements from the second, eponymous story in the Sin City series and a short yarn from the sixth book combined with two original narratives - The Fat Loss and The Long Bad Night - that the author created for the film. Rodriguez, meanwhile, is again on jack-of-all-trades duty, acting as co-director, cinematographer, editor and writing some of the score. Given his predilection for cooking, he probably whipped up a few on-set meals to boot.A Dame To Kill For keeps to the template set out by the first film, and even pushes the comic visuals a step further now that audiences have accepted what the directors were able to do last time. So we return to a torn-from-the-pages monochrome city of dingy shadows, driving digital rain, and the occasional splash of colour for effect. In fact, it's a neat shot of computer-generated Mickey Spillane as before, but this time with an added femme-fatale count.Eva Green makes for a viper of a character in Ava Lord, able to switch her behaviour according to the poor sap she's trying to lure, and the actress is clearly relishing the chance to play such a conniving con artist who wraps men around her little finger and disposes of them when they're no longer useful.
Josh Brolin, taking over from Clive Owen for an earlier visit to Dwight McCarthy's tough existence, gives weary life to a man the world - and lots of people in it - just keeps wanting to beat up. Joseph Gordon-Levitt takes even more punishment as Johnny, the cocksure gambler on a mission to do more than win at poker, yet who ends up losing big. Despite being a completely original tale, Johnny feels like a natural addition to the Sin City canon, a man ready for this tough town to chew up and spit out.
The veterans, meanwhile, are still on good form: Marv fits Mickey Rourke like a glove, and he's just as dark and dangerous as ever, whether he's punishing frat boys for killing tramps or helping Dwight with a mission of his own. Jessica Alba's Nancy adds a few shades from the woman we met before - she's now a damaged, gun-toting version of herself, scarred and sadistic, channelling her fury through her dancing and building up the guts to slaughter the powerful, dreadful Senator Roark (Powers Boothe, back on smug, cigar-chewing form).Of course, hewing so closely to the feel of the original means that its inherent problems still exist: even Ava Lord's slinky power and the weapon-hefting ladies of Old Town (led once more by Rosario Dawson's Gail) can't banish the idea that women get treated terribly in this world, and the men don't come out looking much better. The stylish noir treatment lends a surreal aspect that helps mitigate a lot of that, but the issues remain. Some of the dialogue slides from hard-boiled noir narration to sounding like the feverish dream of a teenager working himself into a Chandler-fuelled frenzy, and not all of the performances fit as well as you might expect.
Yet Rodriguez and Miller have pulled off a sequel that feels truly of a piece with the original, exploring and expanding the world of Sin City and delivering a heady brew of noir, danger and style that will either make you wish you could visit or glad you don't live within a thousand miles of anywhere like it.
A Dame To Kill For shares some of the downsides of the first, particularly dubious female characterisation. But this retains the gritty, gruelling vice-grip on graphic-novel noir that made Sin City so enjoyable.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
97,scottshak_111,A clichéd tale wrapped up in an orgasmic screenplay!,7,9 September 2014,"We have three parallel stories running through the movie. Marv has nothing much to do, so he basically pans out as an assist manifesting eye-popping, head-bursting, head-rolling, rule-breaking action, icing it with numerous gore bits(basically being himself). Dwight has visceral written all over him and the screenplay he grinds 'neath his teeth is sheer music to the ears. Ava surges in blue as the voluptuous dame who writes chaos into the lives of her lovers. One of the finest tales in the flick is that of Johnny, the guy who just cannot lose, played to perfection by the RegularJoe and boy can he act! Hartigan has been brilliantly placed at the right moments, his ghostly presence in the flick has been beautifully portrayed as he tries to justify his love contrasting Nancy's agonizing words. Roark is a sheer depiction of power once again as he eases through his villainous character drenched in perversion. Always an honor to watch Frank Miller's art paint beauty on the big screen. Rodriguez keeps reminding you how subtle his style of direction is albeit sometimes you see loopholes whilst he drives you to a screen almost abruptly without giving a frame some rest. You can throw that over to editing as well. Overlooking that, the score is apt, the tale is passable for just another story of vengeance for a wrongdoing. Apart from the awesomeness of Levitt, Green and Brolin, it doesn't have much to offer!",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
98,kgprophet,Fast Pacing Sacrifices Nuance,6,29 November 2014,"This sequel rivals the first Sin City in it's visuals. But to do so, it sacrificed the slower pacing of the original to show more angles. Gone are the slow motion moments, where we can breathe in the mood. It seems the deliberate attempt to have more action in this sequel is to it's detriment. With less setup for the bad guys before they get offed, we are just going through the numbers.I have to admit I was thrown off when the movie started with two characters that appeared to have died in the first film. I wasn't getting the fact that part of this film acted as a prequel. Frankly, the Mickey Rourke character was not as interesting this time around. Like the first film, there are a few stories going on at once, but the principle story is with James Brolin going after a hot Eva Green. At this point the movie seems to settle down enough that the hypnotic visuals have the desired effect. The third act involves the stripper who seeks revenge. Unfortunately this tale is not as gripping.I avoided this movie in the theatre because the critical consensus was that it wasn't as good as the original so what's the point. I now regret missing it on the big screen in 3D, because the artistic production design had many memorable moments. But sadly yes, the stories told this time don't feel as fresh as the striking original did.I would recommend this film on home video, it certainly held my attention for it's shorter running time.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
99,buckikris,Sin City- A Thrill Of A Sequel,8,25 August 2014,"I went to see this on opening weekend, and it didn't disappoint me. I read the review so I knew what I was getting into. I thought it was excellently done, a little bit of a prequel, present and past all in one. I know that some of the characters replaced the originals; but that didn't bother me. I thought everyone did a great job with the follow up, plus the 3 D effects were brilliant. We start out with Marv's story the pill popping tough guy who seems to have a rough life. He is shaken up after a car accident, but he doesn't remember what happens or how he got there. I have to say Marv-Mickey Rorke, is my favorite guy in both the original and the sequel. He's tough he hate others that pick on the week and he reminds me of me. Even though I am female I can relate to Marv in a way. The majority of the story revolves around this vindictive woman, who manipulates men in order to get what she wants. This is where Josh Brolin's character comes in, a private investigator, who gets involved with her. Little does he know he gets bamboozled as well as other men. She is the perfect Black Widow, who lies and men fall all over her. We also see Joseph Gordon Hewitt, one of Senator Roark's sons come into the picture. He is not a daddy's boy, but he does get back at his father buy beating him at poker. The second time he is not so lucky, he buys it close to the end of the movie by Roark. I also like Nancy's character she is more reckless and vows to get back at Roark for what he did to Harritgan. We do see Bruce Willis's character in this movie, but as a ghost. He watches over Nancy and in the end she does get revenge. All in All the whole movie ties together, even though it's not as good as the first, it is one of those sequels that will be a hit with fans. I was surprised it didn't hit it hot at the box office the first week; only coming in 8th. It is a sequel with more sex, violence, and gore, maybe that's why? I think it's a great sequel, one to add to the DVD collection. Sin City-is a movie to kill for, it will be one of those cult classics eventually. THX, Kris L. CocKayne",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
100,jamiedarlow-37510,Doesn't hang together well but has great moments,5,30 March 2020,"Partly prequel aswell as sequel, there are two stories here that are supremely better than the main story. Sadly, A Dame To Kill For starring Eva Green as the seductive Ava and Josh Brolin taking over the role of Dwight from Clive Owen, takes up the majority of the film's duration and it is the weakest one. Green and Brolin are great as always but don't quite manage to lift it into something exciting and despite all its visual flair, it feels more superficial than involving. What makes it more frustrating is that the mini stories surrounding it are much more interesting. A Long Hard Night starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Johnny, a gambling man who enters into a deadly poker game with the powerful senator Roark (Powers Boothe) is a really cool segment split into two; Boothe really stretches his role into the evil man that Roark really is with devastating effect and Gordon-Levitt is superb with great supporting roles from Julia Garner and Christopher Lloyd (keep your eye out for a cool Lady Gaga cameo too!) Nancy's Last Dance is also an engaging plot with the emotional core of the film being held by Jessica Alba reprising her role fantastically. She is the star of the show I think and really brings the character to a whole new level. Plus she looks amazing in her new revenge look! Mickey Rourke returning as Marv is also a delight and it's great to see him delve deeper into violent depravity against enemies while also holding incredible loyalty for his friends. There's a shiny gem here thanks to these two segments unfortunately buried quite a bit by the main titular story which lets the side down",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
101,Med-Jasta,Very good!,9,20 February 2020,"I loved the original and had to start reading the comic books to get more. And I don't read comics. This movie fits in perfectly with the first, has the same feel and same style. Marv is included a lot which is great. The whole movie is kinda structured more than the first, which was cool.I don't see where the hate comes from. I mean it's not as good as the first but only by a little. I think the problem is that the last third is the worst part of it. In the first movie the worst part was in the middle so we end on a high note. Now when I say worst part I don't mean bad, I just mean weakest part. So when this movie is over you're kinda left with a bad taste in your mouth. Which isn't fair because everything before the last twenty minutes was so good.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
102,shawneofthedead,"Entertaining enough, but commits the cardinal sin of being trapped within - rather than transcending - its genre.",5,6 September 2014,"In 2005, director Robert Rodriguez treated the entire world of cinema-goers to something the likes of which they had never seen before. Somehow, in rich, sombre black-and-white, dotted with bursts of extreme colour, he brought to vivid cinematic life the hard-boiled noir feel of Sin City, the depraved setting for Frank Miller's cult series of graphic novels about crime and, almost poetically, punishment. Close to ten years later, Rodríguez and Miller - now co-directors - return to this same crime-ridden universe to tell a batch of new stories. At its best, the film is quite compelling and looks truly fantastic. But what was undeniably fresh and original in 2005 often feels silly and ripe today - the visuals no longer able to distract from the occasionally ridiculous plots and dialogue Miller heaps upon his characters.As with the first film, Sin City: A Dame To Kill For is a patchwork affair, sewn together from four different tales - the characters stumbling into one another's stories every once in a while. We first meet tough, leather-faced Marv (Mickey Rourke), as he tries to piece together his memory on Just Another Saturday Night. The film plunges into the seedy gambling underworld in The Long Bad Night, as improbably lucky gambler Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) sets himself against the powerful, cruel Senator Roark (Powers Boothe). The centrepiece tale, A Dame To Kill For, features Eva Green - pinch-hitting in full-on sultry mode for Angelina Jolie - as Ava Lord, the titular femme fatale whose grip over Dwight (played by Clive Owen in the first film and Josh Brolin in this one) holds more sinister connotations than he could ever suspect. Finally, we watch as sweet stripper Nancy (Jessica Alba) descends into a pit of despair and addiction after the suicide of her paramour, John Hartigan (Bruce Willis).When the film works, it does so with plenty of style and flair. The mumbled threats and lurking depths of its characters and crimes are perfectly matched by the velvety visuals, a beautiful, odd blend of dark and light. There's a lot to enjoy - and wince over - in Johnny's determination to prove himself a better gambler than Senator Roark: he trades his physical integrity for a chance to tear down a little of Roark's sneering, superior manner, and it's electrifying to watch. Parts of Nancy's downward spiral are affecting, as she - once the oddest, most magical ray of sunshine in a city bled dark by crime - becomes trapped in her own sins of hatred, bitterness and vengeance.But other parts of the film feel, frankly, overwrought. Green looks absolutely smashing as Ava, but her character slinks through a frustrating storyline that's riddled with easy clichés and stereotypes. She trades ripe, silly dialogue with Dwight, and his obsession with and lust for her body draws laughs more often than it provokes thought. In fact, most hints of romance - whether between Ava and practically every male who gets within her orbit (including Christopher Meloni's smitten cop), Dwight and former flame Gail (Rosario Dawson), or Nancy and the gloomy ghost of Hartigan - fall almost gallingly flat.The cast is a blast to watch, at least. Green chews the scenery with grim, sultry determination - the script is never quite up to her efforts, but it's a genre and a character for which she's very well-suited indeed. Gordon-Levitt and Boothe deliver an excellent double-hander, the former cocky in the face of the latter's ego-powered calm. Rourke and Brolin march through their scenes, and Christopher Meloni and Lloyd turn in small, but memorable, supporting performances. Even Alba acquits herself quite well as Nancy sinks ever further into a depression she has no desire to fight.Shorn of the novelty factor that suffused the first film, however, Sin City: A Dame To Kill For - thrilling as it is to watch and quite good on occasion - never really gels into a coherent viewing experience. The characters exchange quips rather than dialogue, their motivations and concerns barely able to invoke any kind of emotional response in audiences. Where the first film felt almost effortlessly cool, this one sometimes feels a little foolish - quite unable to transcend and revitalise its genre, it often feels stuck within it instead.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
103,jcbutthead86,"A Terrific,Visually Stunning,Thrilling And Entertaining Sequel.",10,27 August 2014,"Sin City:A Dame To Kill For is a terrific,visually stunning,thrilling and entertaining sequel that combines fantastic direction,a great cast,a fine script and a memorable score. And while Sin City 2 isn't as a good as the original,it's a wonderful sequel that works as a memorable follow-up.Set before and after the events and stories in the first film,Sin City:A Dame To Kill For gives viewers four more thrilling and intense tales of Sin City.The original Sin City was a brilliant,unforgettable and groundbreaking Comic Book film and is one of my all-time favorite movies and seemed like a film that would get a sequel. After nine years comes the sequel Sin City:A Dame To Kill For and was it worth the wait? Yes it was because Sin City:A Dame To Kill For is a fantastic sequel that is an absolute blast from start to finish because whether it's the first film or Frank Miller's Graphic Novels I love the world of Sin City and with Sin City it was fun to return to the dark,Black and White Noirish world of Sin City and if you're a fan of the first film or Miller's book you will enjoy this worthy sequel to the first film. Co-directors Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller have given viewers a stylish sequel that right from the beginning gives viewers the same energy and thrills that made the first movie work in the first place and the whole time you're watching the film you can't take your eyes off of it. The movie works as a sequel and prequel combining two stories from Frank Miller's books(A Dame To Kill For and Just Another Saturday Night)and new stories written for the film(The Long,Bad Night and Nancy's Last Dance)where each story interconnects with one another. Sin City 2 also shows viewers that while this is still a sequel nothing has changed in Sin City,the Antiheroes are still tough and the bad guys are more vicious with violence all around and blood splattered with every functioning in a stylized Film Noir world that is amoral and dark with hard boiled attitudes. The Black and White photography is stunning and beautiful because while the audience see horrific things on the screen you can't look away because the movie is amazing to look at. In Sin City 2 we also see some of the known and familiar characters and faces from the first film such as Marv,Dwight,Hartigan,Nancy and others we also see new characters such as Ava Lord and Johnny with both characters who are fascinating and memorable. The Action and violence in SC2 is vicious and at times harsh and brutal matching the first movie and none of the violence is toned down or cut although SC2 isn't as gory as the first movie. The screenplay by Frank Miller is good and memorable giving the characters dialog and moments that is straight out of Film Noir although some the dialog lacks the creative style of the Graphic Novels. If there is one problem I have with SC2 it's the length of the movie which is 1 hour and 42 minutes. Where as the first film was 2 hours and 4 minutes,SC2 is much shorter and while 1 hour and 42 minutes isn't bad I would have loved for the movie to be ten to twenty minutes longer because with the exception of A Dame To Kill For(which is almost 50 minutes and is the longest and best segment)the other two of the four tales The Long,Bad Night and Nancy's Last Dance while wonderful and compelling are too short,rushed and feel like they both should have been longer at 30-35 minutes like the stories in the first film. I hope someday Robert Rodriguez releases a director's or extended cut because even though the movie is fine the way it is I wanted more. The ending of Sin City:A Dame To Kill For is fine in my opinion even though the ending will upset and divide some viewers as some will think the ending is anti-climatic and will interfere with the continuity of the first film but I think it works because of the story and tone of the Sin City universe. A good ending for this entertaining film.The cast is great. Mickey Rourke is excellent once again as Marv,with Rourke being charismatic and cool every time he's on screen. Josh Brolin is terrific as Dwight,with Brolin bringing an intensity to the role. Jessica Alba is amazing,sexy and at her best as Nancy,with Alba bringing an emotional depth to the role. Bruce Willis is great as Hartigan Joseph Gordon-Levitt is fantastic and memorable as Johnny,a cocky gambler. Eva Green is outstanding and beautiful as Ava Lord,the classic Femme Fatale and Dwight's ex-girlfriend. Powers Boothe sensational and menacing as Senator Roark,with Boothe commanding every scene he's in. Rosario Dawson is sexy and memorable once again as Gail,Dwight ex-girlfriend. Dennis Haybert(replacing the late Michael Clarke Duncan)is good as Manute,Ava's bodyguard. Christopher Meloni(Mort),Jeremy Piven(Bob),Jamie Chung(Miho),Ray Liotta(Joey),Stacy Keach(Vallenquist),Christopher Lloyd(Kroenig),Julia Garner(Marcie),Juno Temple(Sally),Marton Csokas(Damian Lord),Jude Ciccoella(Lt. Lebowitz),Jamie King(Goldie/Wendy)and Lady Gaga(Bertha)give good performances as well. The direction by Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller is wonderful and stylish with Rodriguez and Miller always moving the camera and giving the movie and fine pace and look. Great direction,Rodriguez and Miller.The score by Robert Rodriguez is memorable and filled with energy like in the original. Good score,Rodriguez.In final word,if you loved the first Sin City,the graphic novels,Robert Rodriguez or Frank Miller,I highly suggest you see Sin City:A Dame To Kill For,a terrific and entertaining sequel that is not as good as the original but still a worthy and memorable follow to the first film. Highly Recommended. 9.5/10.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
104,gavinp9,"Another fun, gritty, violence-fuelled ride through Sin City",8,2 January 2018,"'Sin City: A Dame To Kill For' is a quality sequel to an exceptional, unique film. I gave 'Sin City' 4.5 stars and this film doesn't quite match the first film's graphic violence or pure originality. Having said that, however, there's still plenty to love about 'Sin City 2' - it's genuinely funny in parts, has the same great comic book-feel, with fantastic use of black & white, shadows and splashes of vivid colour to highlight certain aspects of a scene. The use of animation blends superbly with the actual actors and the score keeps everything moving.Returning from the first 'Sin City' film are Marv (Rourke), Nancy (Alba), Roark (Boothe), Gail (Dawson), Dwight (now Brolin, not Owen), Miho (now Chung, not Aoki), Manute (now Haysbert, not Clarke Duncan, due to obvious reasons) and Hartigan (Willis, in flashbacks). The characters don't get confusing or overwhelming, since the film's basically split into three inter-connected parts. There's Johnny (Gordon-Levitt) and his poker battles with the corrupt Senator Roark, then Ava (Green, who spends 50% of her screen-time naked - not a bad thing!) & Dwight's ill-fated romance, and finally Marv & Nancy's decision to do something about Roark. Almost each of the three parts has overlap with 3-5 characters from the other parts, all handled very well. There's also plenty of great supporting cast - Meloni, Piven, Lloyd, Liotta, Temple.I really enjoy how it looks like a comic book, but it could easily be the back streets of New York, Chicago or Los Angeles. There's some nice tie-ins back to the first film, still plenty of guns, swords and fighting - Marv/Rourke does remind me of Hellboy/Perlman a lot! - all done quickly (less than 100min) and stylishly.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
105,TheMarwood,Belated sequel looks cheap and feels lazy,4,13 October 2014,"With almost a decade of vfx and digital camera advances since its predecessor, this cheap looking sequel is the victim of a lazy production and a vfx house in way over their head. Even though he owns a vfx house, director Robert Rodriguez secured funding only for the production and got the unscrupulous vfx house Prime Focus to be an equity partner and do the effects for free for the film's back-end. Well, you get what you pay for and the visuals are a step backward from the first, with some truly awful rendering and digital explosions. The lighting is sloppy and in plenty of scenes works against the makeup fx on the actors. Marv looks puffy and the fine detail and texture that was applied to Mickey Rourke on the first film, is not only missing, but hastily thrown together like most things in this hack work - and the makeup transformation on Josh Brolin to resemble Clive Owen is an embarrassment. The lazy tech aspects aside, the stories limp along with little energy and wit and a new story written for this film by Frank Miller and staring Joseph Gordon Levitt ends up jarringly pointless. There's very little life in this picture and while the original still feels fresh, A Dame to Kill For is dull and easily forgettable.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
106,GeorgeRoots,This Dame Ain't Worth The Bullet.,5,2 September 2014,"A lot has happened in the nine years since we last visited ""Sin City"" (2005). Sadly, a majority of recognisable talent had passed away, and comic book movies had seemed to explode in the public conscience. Robert Rodriguez went to do his own thing, and Frank Miller would go on to adapt another beloved comic book character, Will Eisner's ""The Spirit"" (2008). It essentially had nothing to do with the character, and ended up as one of the most bizarre, melodramatic movies I've seen in recent years.Well I'd be lying if I didn't say I was anticipating this movie for a long time. Rob and Frank were back together, and they were adapting one of the less well received original yarns, plus two new ones especially for the film. Unfortunately as you can tell by my rating, there were a lot of bizarre problems be it big and small that greatly hindered the movie for me. Obviously they put all their best stories in the first movie, yet one written for this movie starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt was surprisingly the best of all. The one with Nancy (Jessica Alba), sinking further into depression was bizarre and ended the movie horrifically (Regardless, both had a great performance from Powers Boothe).As far as adapting the ""A Dame to Kill For"" storyline they hit all the right bumps, yet the little things made a not so great story even worse. Eva Green's performance is fine, yet very over-acted and it's not entirely her fault as the characters motivations are as predictable as they were in the book. Josh Brolin did well, yet some of that dialogue had me in stitches and the wig he wears at the end of this was one of the most abysmal efforts I've ever seen to make one actor look like another actor, ""just because"".But saying that, all the make-up is terrible. The character Marv (Mickey Rourke), is heavily used in this production and his face makeup was terrible considering how good it looks nine years ago. I'm not trying to be mean with this statement, but whether or not it is due to Rourke's reconstructive surgery I don't know. Final thing I really need to say is that the CGI this time around felt more like a video game. Some scenes did absolutely fantastic in terms of lighting, but the colour scheme stopped feeling special due to it's abundance. If your going to white out someone's glasses like they were all the time in the source material, just goddamn do it.Unfortunately, for all those small things I've made big deals about, none of the moments in this one fully engaged me throughout it's two hours. 75% of the film is literally working with the worst the series has to offer, and though it's execution is impressive you can't polish a turd. The melodrama is thick, the supporting cast come off as absurd and hypocrisy has me saying I could watch it again, but I could never recommend it. For laughs, another thing I found unintentionally hilarious is that the Senator has pictures of his paedophile son hanging around after the yellow disfigurement. They all look menacing, and you can't help but chuckle and wonder why they didn't throw in a few before and after's.Final Verdict: A sequel that could've been so much better, the fact that the original had half the budget this one did really makes you wonder. 5/10. I suppose it would be interesting to see both movies now back to back.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
107,luke-a-mcgowan,"Not sure what I just watched, but it was not bad",6,10 October 2014,"Off the bat - I thought Sin City was a straight up masterpiece. It was a fun bloodbath of unparalleled proportions, whilst maintaining some memorable characters and some very touching moments (mostly the love between Nancy and Hartigan).Sin City: A Dame to Kill For boasts a very talented cast. It retains the superbly talented Mickey Rourke, Rosario Dawson, Jessica Alba and Powers Boothe from the first, and its safe to say that all four of them excel even further in the sequel. Recasting was necessary on several occasions, but the only one that grated on me was Dennis Haysbert in place of Michael Clarke Duncan. Haysbert was adequate, but brought barely any weight or presence to the position beyond a big, black body. The new cast is superb - Eva Green is flawless as the dastardly Ava, Christopher Meloni is surprisingly effective as Mort, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is refreshingly different as the card shark Johnny, and its a delight to see Lady Gaga and Ray Liotta, albeit in shamefully underused roles.However, the script is far less easy to follow than its predecessor. It is completely impossible to place whether this is a sequel or prequel to the original Sin City. Additionally, none of the returning characters get any more character development, least of all Marv, who feels as if he has gone backwards since his introduction. Whilst Eva Green's segment is delightful to watch, none of the new material is capable of matching the relationship between Hartigan and Nancy, the blind love Senator Roark has for his deranged son, or politics of Oldtown's management - the stories that made the original so memorable. The film retains its beautiful, stylish, artistic flair, and its so refreshing to see the film flaunt violence regulations and go all out violent. Its especially great to see Rourke and Dawson kick ass on screen. However, upon finishing viewing A Dame to Kill For, I wasn't left particularly wowed. A Dame to Kill For is not the masterpiece that its predecessor was, but its certainly a pleasant way to kill a few hours of your time.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For

Majority of the cast from the first movie were there despite the unfortunate deaths of Michael Clarke Duncan who was replaced by Dennis Haysbert and Brittany Murphy. Being as Clive Owen was one of the stand outs from the first movie, being replaced by Josh Brolin for the character Dwight had a detrimental effect on my viewing of this one. Clive Owen stated conflicting scheduling as his reason for not being in Sin City 2. The other change was Devon Aoki who was pregnant and was replaced by Jamie Cheung who didnt have the same impact.

I will not mention Robert Rodriguez for is wrong to speak ill of the dead. Well, dead career anyway. He's doing TV. Mr. Miller can't write real dialogue, gritty or otherwise.

Other countries also take a bigger slice of the pie than American movie houses.I'll let that sink in.

While it does give some pretty cool action sequences and an entertaining enough story, this fails to generate the same thrill audiences had watching the original. Starring an all star cast featuring Jessica Alba, Eva Green, Mickey Rourke, Joseph Gordon Levitt and Josh Brolin, the performances here are soapy and very noir esque much in the vein of the original. We enjoy some cameo appearances from Bruce Willis and Ray Liotta, but much of the re-casted roles such as Dennis Haysbert as Manute fall flat. The sequences in the film keep us interested despite some rather boring action sequences towards the end that feel redundant and echo the campiness of original a bit more than the uniqueness of it. Robert Rodriguez doesn't do much for the film and continues to prove that cheaply made films still can be thrilling, the only problem here is that he has proved that with his entire filmography and feels as if he is stuck in one gear the entire time. Much like his last film Machete Kills, this is far from art and its much more splat cinema than anything else.

111,Quebec_Dragon,The best prequel/sequel it could have been considering the circumstances,8,2 September 2014,"If you haven't watched the great first movie, I would suggest stopping to read right now as I'll refer to it later on, so spoiler warnings, but only for the original movie. Let's start by saying it has a similar structure to the first Sin City: a few short stories linking up sometimes by locations or characters. There's Marv dealing with frat boys torching vagrants for fun in the intro; Dwight coping with the return of a lost love that betrayed him in the past; Nancy Callaghan wanting revenge on the father of the yellow bastard for what happened to her and Hartigan; and a new guy called Johnny, a great gambler, trying to win big at poker but there for personal stakes.I was confused throughout by seeing Marv popping up everywhere still alive when he was supposed to be quite dead. It could not be explained by it being a prequel because one of the stories (Nancy Callaghan's) was an obvious sequel. I was also confused more than once by the timelines of certain characters that I thought shouldn't be there or shouldn't die (more on that later). Turns out I was wrong and everything fit chronologically. Here's a simple explanation: every story takes place, including Nancy Callaghan's (Jessica Alba) before Marv's story in Sin City 1. Dwight's story is a prequel to his story in Sin City 1. The only ""sequel"" is for Nancy Callaghan and Hartigan's main story that follows directly their story from Sin City 1.This is the best Sin City movie prequel/sequel/whenever that could have been done considering several factors. First factor is that it was released 9 years later. Despite that, they did manage to get most of the same actors. The main problem is that Clive Owen's character, Dwight, was replaced by Josh Brolin because Owen had other engagements. It is really a shame that they couldn't get him, because it would have been really neat to see him after a certain event, not to mention surprising for those who didn't remember the same character was in the first film. Plus, Brolin's pseudo-Owen makeup and wig were lacking and hurt the suspension of disbelief. The other actor changes for Miho, Manute and Bob - because of pregnancy, death and unknown reason - didn't matter that much. Very important factor to consider: it was mostly made by the same creative team including Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller. It felt and looked like the first movie despite not having the novelty factor anymore. Another factor to take into account is that the stories are based on the Miller's stories, there's a limited number of them (they even used 2 unpublished here), and that arguably the best ones were taken for the first movie. Consequently, I didn't think the stories were as gripping or amazing as the ones in the original movie, yet they were very good and in the same violent noir/graphic novel spirit. They also had surprising moments, but a few were kind of ruined by the fact I thought a few secondary characters couldn't die if they were in the original movie since we were in a prequel part for them in Sin City 2, or so I thought. I was mistaken, confused, and it lessened my enjoyment a little. The stylized action was as well made as the first although it didn't strike me as being as memorable. The dialogues and narration, an highlight of the first movie for me, weren't as inspired, even lame sometimes.Acting wise, Eva Green once again impressed me, this time with a smart, complex femme fatale role. I was sometimes gleefully smiling when she was using her devious wiles on the poor men. Perhaps because she's of French origin, nudity didn't seem to bother her and there was a lot of it here, mostly artistic. On the other hand, despite trying hard, I didn't particularly like Jessica Alba as Nancy Callaghan. She had a big character arc yet didn't quite convince me, nor move me emotionally. Also, you never see her nude, nor any of her colleagues, making this bar the lamest ""strip"" bar ever ;-) I particularly enjoyed the charismatic, cocky performance by Gordon-Levitt as Johnny. Marv didn't seem as great as in the first film, but you see more of him as he has a major role in more than one story. Weirdly, I liked his make-up and hair less. Josh Brolin was OK I guess, but lacked the presence and intensity of Owen. Powers Boothe doing Senator Roarke did a great villain. Everyone else did respectable jobs, although Willis had very little to do. If you liked the first film, I have trouble seeing how you could not be satisfied with this one too although it wasn't as good. It's also worth seeing in theatres and in 3D.Rating: 7.5 out of 10 (very good)",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
112,coconutkungfu-30704,One Of My Fave Comic Book Movies,10,16 February 2020,"Robert Rodriguez already proved he was right person for the job when it came to adapting Frank Miller's Sin City Comics with the first film, and this one is equally as good IMHO, if not better.
The visuals are on point, the cast does a great job, and as an adaptation this is pretty flawless.
The fact that viewers get a chance to see a never published Sin City story in this one was a real treat for someone like me who read and enjoyed all the Sin City comics. This is a great comic book movie IMHO and is highly recommended.10 out of 10!",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
113,David_del_Real_Reviews_in_IMDb,+++ The Feeling of the Comic Book with a Small Plus ++++,9,28 November 2017,"+++ The Feeling of the Comic Book with a Small Plus ++++ ------- ------- ------- ------- Capturing again that sensation from the comic maybe caused by those black and white scenes with some areas in color that make a feeling of cold and shivers travel all the way up our spine, this second part of Frank Miller's Sin City is completely worth-watching.Being based primarily in Frank Miller's second story from the SIN CITY series, it was actually the one that I thought that they'd have taken to the big screen when they made their first movie as it was by far my favorite and the one that had a more defined central argument.Continuing with all the good stuff from the first movie, it uses a lot of characters and elements we already knew, we had a conclusion for the tormented tale of Nancy Callahan portrayed by Jessica Alba and John Hartigan (now a ghost), performed by Bruce Willis which was a very logical conclusion to their story. But along all the good elements in the film, foremost I think that Eva Green's AVA gives us an interesting turn to the plot; unlike her comic book counterpart, this AVA never really seems a defenseless damsel in distress which means that most men falling for her can't be really considered victims, as they fell actually wanting to fall; they could have believed anything she said or even still make her will in the case they didn't. That makes her character a bit more powerful and some of the other characters, much less innocent.As I said I thought that this was going to be the story that they were going to use in the first SIN CITY movie and now that they have finally taken it to the screen, IMO it was completely worth it.I don't understand fully why it was not as successful as the first part. My guess is that it was not so surprising for a lot of people because most of the characters weren't new and the interesting visual format wasn't new either, nevertheless I think that both movies are more or less equally good, even when I must admit I prefer this second one by a bit.Thanks for reading.IMDb Review written by David del Real.November 2017.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
114,Bruce722,Terrible film.,4,27 December 2014,"Sin City, similar to the first film, a the perfect example of style over substance. It's a film essentially made up of three short stories, which I'll call the gambler, the sex goddess, and the vengeful stripper for the purpose of this review, that are loosely connected to one another through setting and a few characters. The problem is, only one of those stories (the sex goddess) is even remotely interesting. The other two range from abysmal to mediocre and are filled with lazy writing and ludicrous action sequences. I love the style and the cinematography of the film and think the acting was outstanding across the board but no movie can overcome a complete and utter lack of content. The ""sex goddess"" story was actually very good. It had an intriguing plot, characters will motivations that made sense, and it developed really well. The action sequence at the end was ridiculous but outside of a flying ninja prostitute, an expanded version of that story would've made for a fantastic film in and of itself. Unfortunately the other two stories dragged it down to, what I consider a rating that equates to ""watch for free but don't spend money on it"".",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For

116,foxtografo,Disappointed,6,26 August 2014,"Sin City (2005) is one of my favourite movies of all time. I loved it as a movie on it's own and it's one of the best adaptations from comic to movie I've ever seen. Plus, the actors are all great, the story, characters... Somehow this one failed as a movie. The movie (or photography) style still looks the same, but it's not as perfect as in the first one. The little coloured bits seemed misplaced in this one for me, and the comic-like shots weren't so great. There's some good shots, but seemed repetitive in the dancing scenes and the nudes (not that I complain for the fact that Eva Green was naked most of the time, but was she paid for showing the breast by the minute?) The stories weren't as interesting as the first one. The action scenes looked corny, but not in a ""comic"" way, but poorly choreographed and un-stylish, plus really bad extras. I was so excited of seeing Brolin and Levit in the movie (two actors I really like), but none of them stories made full use of their potentials, just an excuse to show more of Marv getting involved. I enjoyed a lot of shots from the movie, and watching Marv back was good too, but again, as his thing is the action scenes and they weren't well done, he fell a bit obsolete. There's some fun gore and beautiful girls all along the movie, but not enough to make it even close as good as the first one. Not even such a good movie on it's own. I'm very disappointed, I won't be re-watching this one as I did (and will) with the other one. Maybe the ""high expectation syndrome"" applied here, but I knew what to expect from this and I didn't get it.Good photography, fair acting, story and script, poor choreography and action.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
117,MickeyTheConstant,Disappointing Sequel,3,26 December 2018,It's been quite a while since I last saw the first Sin City movie but I remember really enjoying it. It felt really original and unique and as a comic book fan I was happy with it. I can't really explain why it has taken me so long to watch this follow up movie but after ages I gave it a try. I honestly found it all a bit of a mess. It was so hectic. At times I felt bored. Very few characters I cared for. Characters I remembered enjoying watching in the first movie I did not really give a damn about in this movie. The only character I enjoyed was Josh Brolins but his story was ridiculous. In fact many of the stories were just nonsense. I am no prude but I found much of the Eva Green's nudity so unnecessary. She is an amazing actress and I just felt it wasn't needed to the extent we saw. All the visuals were ok but not as good or I should say as cool as the original. I say cool as that was what the original Sin City was whereas this sequel just seemed like it was trying to hard. Disappointing,Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
118,achyutaghosh,Disappointing!,5,28 September 2014,"A 9 year wait comes to a slightly disappointing end. Frank Miller is losing his touch. Neo noir thriller Sin City: A Dame to Kill For carries the same fantastic visual cues that were the highlight of Sin City. Some characters are carried over too, in addition to new ones that Miller penned just for this movie. However, the stories and performances this time are simply not as engaging as its predecessor.The first is aptly named Just Another Saturday Night. Marv suddenly wakes up to find himself in a car crash and several dead bodies, clueless about what happened. Death and Marv go hand in hand, but even then this story is darkly funny. The second is a new feature- Johnny (Gordon-Levitt) is a cocky young gambler out to show his skills to his father'who has disowned him. This is a sad tale of redemption. The third is the movie title- A Dame to Kill For, aptly played by a mostly nude Eva Green, who is a master manipulator, a sultry vixen unleashing her bag of tricks on a suspecting yet helpless ex-lover played by Josh Brolin. The fourth provides kind of a closure to Hartigan and Nancy from the first movie. Nancy exploits Marv's innate goodness to take her revenge on the yellow bastard grieving Rourke.As like the first, Miller's visionary style ensures that there is an ensemble cast in place. Old timers Mickey Rourke, Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Bruce Willis, Jaime King, and Powers Boothe get to play their original characters, while newcomers include Josh Brolin, Joseph Gordon- Levitt, Eva Green, Ray Liotta, Jamie Chung, Lady Gaga, Alexa Vega, and Juno Temple, all crammed in 4 tales of stylized passion and violence, with Marv as the connecting thread. This is actually the film's main problem- too many characters, too many stories, in too short a time- 100 minutes. Actors hardly get to establish themselves before getting knocked over. And everybody in Sin City does get knocked over, eventually. Katana toting femme fatales, indestructible killing machines, lecherous old men, crooked cops, genial prostitutes, fallen heroes- all spewing monologues whilst indulging in gratuitous levels of barbaric savagery. Sounds familiar? Yes, we saw all that in Sin City years back. This is the second major flaw in this movie, it brings nothing new to the table. The dialogs too do not carry the memorable punch of the original.The film's unique mixture of animation and live action, on a mostly black and white palette that occasionally sprinkles a bit of color is still a visual treat, no doubt. But the overall feel of the movie kind of reminds me of Miller's earlier turkey, The Spirit- all style but no impact- 5/10",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
119,Semisonic,"Not too shocking, not too gripping, and ultimately not too interesting movie",6,9 November 2014,"The year 2014 promised to be really great. Because for this year were scheduled the sequels for two of arguably the most iconic movies of 2000's: 300 and Sin City. Obviously, to each his own, but nobody can deny the whole uniqueness of those movies and the ripples they sent through the audience when they were released. Shocking and stylish, gripping and disturbing, but impressive and awe-inspiring, those movies set a new example of what a film can offer to a spectator.Now it's already November, and both of the sequels managed not only to get their screening time in movie theaters but also reach the Blu-ray sector. So it's hardly a secret that the expectations that most of those who saw and loved the original films had were hardly met. I can't help but wonder: why? Maybe we just had to wait a bit too much for the sequels, and the impression the originals made was already set in stone for nothing to ever challenge it? Or maybe it's all about Eva Green whose proud nakedness just didn't bring the luck it was supposed to? Or it's just that the original movies had all the best their franchise could offer, and any attempt to make a sequel was doomed to be for nothing but conning more money out of people using their love for the original movies? I don't have all the answers for you, and i believe it's up to each and every one of you to find them for yourself. This review is my personal story of disappointment. Read at your own risk ;).For starters, the similarities between this movie and the sequel to 300 sum up to one and only thing: they both had great predecessors. Well, that and Eva Green, but that doesn't really matter. And while the new 300 was just a general failure to make the good impression by giving a second portion of the story (and my reasons to think so are already presented in a separate review here), SC:ADtKF simply felt pointless.The story that the original Sin City told us was almost perfectly concluded, not requiring any further elaboration. Maybe it's one of the reasons we waited for nine long years for this sequel: because there was no need to make one to begin with. And since we had too few loose ends for a potential sequel to tie up, a new movie would have to bring something entirely new to the plate, something we could use to re-discover the universe of Sin City, see it from a fresh new perspective.That task is exactly what the new movie failed to accomplish. Because what we got was a rehash of same old stuff with some minor addition. Indeed, we got two new characters, Johnny and Ava, the latter major enough to name a sequel after her. But those new characters were never the main driving force of the movie, which is only proved by the fact they both were disposed of at the end. So the film had to revert to the good ol' guys like Marv and Dwight, even though Dwight went through some ""remodeling"" to make things more fresh. The new Dwight was more or less okay (not as cool as Clive Owen's performance still), but Marv definitely felt overused.Honestly, that's the most pathetic thing a sequel could do: dwell on the base its predecessor created, afraid to make a step too far away from it. And that felt way too obvious throughout the whole movie, making the new novels bland and weak. We got to see three novels: the unacknowledged son of Senator Roark trying to prove something to his father, Nancy Callahan being lost and looking for a new meaning in her life, and Dwight McCarthy being a ladies' man again. The original Sin City never gave you a single reason to think that one of its novels was more important than the other: all of them were filled to the brim with action, tension and loud banging climaxes. Here only the ""Dame to kill for"" novel could ever be considered full-fledged and possibly on par with the original (emotion-wise and plot-wise). The story of the lucky gambler kid was plain weak, with a message so unclear that one might think there's no message at all. And the story of Nancy seeking revenge simply made no sense, breaking the continuity of the original film, so that some people on this board even claim it was not real at all, that what we saw was nothing but Nancy going crazy and having delusions. And from those delusions straight to the ending credits, what a way to end a movie...I can't say that the new Sin City is a total failure. It just didn't have the heart to be something on its own, something more than a bunch of stylish tricks we loved from the original movie. I guess if you didn't watch the first movie then this one won't be so bad. That's why i gave it 6 out of 10. But really, having re-watched the 2005's Sin City just now, i could clearly see that this rating is more than generous for something that tries way too hard and way too bad to hide that it just doesn't have a fire in the belly anymore. Like the loud music in the ending credits song trying to conceal Steven Tyler's failure to use his voice like he used to be capable to. No shame, but a pity for sure.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
120,krycek19,Lightyears better than the original,8,13 May 2015,"Warning: the ending is told in this review.While the first movie was visually beautiful and groundbreaking at the time it came out, it was also a long dull affair. This sequel however, that I was expecting to suck big time, was surprisingly good. A lot more action and violence this time around than in the first one. And a better story. And two added bonuses: the smoking hot Eva Green, was completely naked in pretty much all her scenes. And the second bonus: the best acting I've seen from Bruce Willis since Die Hard 4.0. This gives me hope that he may recover from being a douche-bag and start being a good actor again.The only reason I'm not giving Sin City 2, 10 stars, is that we don't get to see Senator Roark die. After building up to that moment for the entire film, the least they could have done was giving the audience the satisfaction of watching him die. Fading to black and then hearing the gunshot isn't good enough. This is the first movie I've ever given this high a rating and I'm actually looking forward to a fourth movie.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For

I re-watched the first part prior to watching this and man it really contrasted how lazy this movie felt compared to the first one. Sure the movie had awesome visuals and the same style which made me love the first part but everything else felt really sloppy, like the creators just lazily put together this film. Eva green is definitely a dame to kill for, she is just DAMN. BUT that arc was meh. The only arc that really felt good and interesting was of Joseph Gordon Levitt's, he was great in it. They brought Marv back but he sorta felt pointless, like shoehorned in, it created some continuity problems too. Also, he looked weird, his face makeup was either bad or just different. Nancy's arc was OK. Jessica Alba did act pretty good, especially in those psycho scenes, but I dunno, it just wasn't that interesting since no Hartigan this time. I really wanted this to be good just like the first part but SIGH. It isn't a bad movie per say, an OK film overall, but considering how awesome the first part was, this just pales in comparison to that. 6.8/10",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For

Not as much as the original but that's only because the graphic effects aren't original anymore... aren't original, but are still absolutely stunning.The plot interweaves a small number of strands around the characters from the first film, plus a few new ones. There's nothing especially in the plot lines but it held my interest.It's the visuals that you'll watch this movie for. It has the absolutely spot-on feel of a comic strip but at the same time the grit of reality. It's quite a feat.Then there's the use of colour. It's entirely black and white bar the use of single colours to highlight items at seemingly arbitrary points but with spectacular effect - a dress, a drop of blood, the iris of an eye.If they bring out a third one I'll happily watch that too.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
123,skoyles,Much BETTER than the first!,8,4 January 2015,"The original Sin City was gloriously stylish and, for my taste at least, hideously distasteful. I could admire much of it but the spiritual perversion of parts of it left a rotten taste in my mouth. I had expect ""film noir"" and got ""film sick and ugly"". ""Sin City: A Dame to Die For"" is film noir. It is raw, tough and sexy but, as with the best film noir, it is not disgusting. It is also more rooted in Los Angeles, the true home of film noir. I almost expect Philip Marlow to walk around a corner. Powers Booth is corrupted power incarnate; Eva Green is ditto for feminine evil; Jessica Alba is not only beautiful but moving in her sad part; Marv is quintessentially Marv, ""300 pounds of iron""; Josh Brolin is great; Joseph Gordon-Levitt is superb. All the actors are flawless. What truly makes this a better motion picture is the story telling: tight, coherent, satisfying.

Without Clive Owen, it lacks that extra-darkened gravitas. The original Sin City, had a great plot. This sequel did not. The card-player guy what the? Why is he even in this movie, or in the story- line? Just to fill time. As the movie reaches its 2/3rds point, you are left with an emptiness in your stomach. You realize that this won't be a great movie. There is just no building tension. There is really no cohesiveness to it at all. It's just a collage of fight scenes with raspy voice-overs. It looks like Sin City, but it just doesn't feel like Sin City.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
125,FilmMuscle,Sinful Storytelling,6,25 August 2014,"The corrupt and merciless city is back in its ever-alluring black and white landscape. The many deranged and eccentric of its inhabitants collide with one another and use their selfishness and cunning to manipulate the other and exact proper revenge. The city evermore smells of revenge, sex, and insolence. It is Sin City after all. Even our primary protagonists have a long way to go before they reach the path of righteousness and honor. Marv (Mickey Rourke) is still a cold and ruthless human being, regardless of the occasional instances in which he helps wage war against the city's most powerful and evil of souls. Nancy (Jessica Alba) continues her disconsolate life, sensuously dancing amongst multitudinous drunken perverts. Josh Brolin strangely replaces Clive Owen (which is a shame, no offense) as the vigilant photographer, Dwight. And with a sequel also come new characters like the charming, cocksure Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who never ceases finding fortune in gambling; and a venomous epitomical femme fatal, Ava (Eva Green) who always gets her way with gentlemen whether it's for the sake of security or violence. In essence, the city itself and its numerous residents together create a fascinating and unique atmosphere that we were all stunned by back in 2005, and now—nine years later—still, at least, envelops us with wonder. Of course, the awe-inspiring, gorgeous visuals (the stylistic color palette—everything painted in black and white until a vibrantly dressed woman enters the setting) are the main attraction. The cinematography is executed with stupendous creativity as to the orchestration of each new shot. For example, we witness a marvelous shot of Eva Green diving into the pool—the screen vertically split between underwater and above, emitting an elegant reflection of a woman from both sides of the screen majestically diving in. Or another where miniature-scaled cars maniacally crashing around Marv's enlarged head on his many thrilling chases. The colors, the choreography of the camera, the appealing pure white goo that spurts from a body in the place of expected crimson blood, the refreshing noir setting—all of these terrific elements combine to generate that what makes these two films so impressive. When it comes to the plot, it starts out strong as the excited audience is getting the feel of it again after a nine-year hiatus, shrouded in mystery and developing like an intriguing thriller. As with its predecessor, the film interconnects various story lines into a tryingly cohesive grand picture. Personally, Gordon-Levitt's story arc was the most investing and compelling—a man who interestingly appears to be more vulnerable than the rest. His tense encounters with Roark (Powers Boothe), a repulsively diabolical and potent politician, definitely had my attention. Alba's arc was certainly the weakest; being the last storyline, by that point, I was already tired of the movie and willing to take another sizable break before I see the next installment. Every single arc keeps repeating the predominant theme of revenge, and eventually, it wears thin through all its monotony. Once the characters' backgrounds and motives have been fully realized, the pay- off, in comparison, is ultimately unsatisfying and unremarkable. Fans of the distinct art style might be entertained for the first hour, but when the repetitiveness and gradual dulling of the narrative becomes even more transparent, the magic of the once-magnificent world tragically diminishes. There's no more ground to break and seemingly no more enthralling stories to tell.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For

127,meritcoba,A shallow tale exposed.,6,25 August 2017,"Intense torment is part of the makeup of the denizens of Sin City, where people do bad things even if it was their intent to do good. And regardless of their intentions, torment is their due. The city corrupts and twists morals yet despite this corruption sometimes good comes from bad. This formula made the first movie work but the magic falters in this one because at heart the characters and story are incredible shallow. But this was all hidden from sight by the sheer intensity of its telling. As a concept, supported by some enigmatic filming, fitting dialogue and characters whose plight you care about(mostly John Hartigan and Nancy Callahan) the first movie was great. It was intense.But in this movie, despite everything, it is the characters that are lacking. The only really interesting person is Ava Lord played by Eva Green and,to a lesser degree, Senator Roark, played by Powers Boothe. The others, even Dwight McCarthy, Nancy Callahan and Gail, seem bland and the latter turned in an extra.Obviously the casting has suffered at some points. It demonstrates once more how the right actors can change a movie. Clive Owen has been replaced by Jos Brolin as Dwight McCharty, which made for a somewhat indifferent feel. Aiko is replaced by Chung as Miho which definitely changed her character dramatically. Aiko made Miho just look terrifying dangerous while Chung makes her look cute. The final nail in the coffin is that the movie lacks intensity. What looked awesome in the first looks bland in the second and once you are no longer charmed away from the movie by its intense telling the shallow depth of its story and characters are exposed and thus turns it the lesser movie.Still, this isn't a bad movie. It can be worse and it certainly is still entertaining even if it was only for watching Eva Green, Powers Boothe and Mickey Rourke.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
128,vistheindian,Faithful but not perfection,7,29 August 2014,"Quickie Review:After 9 years Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller brings us back to the world of Sin City with the sequel A Dame to Kill For. The movie follows four different interweaving short stories, each focusing on a particular character. Some of those are familiar from the original, and one other is a whole new character. Complete with the graphic novel visual style, woven story lines, and inner monologues, A Dame to Kill For does everything to keep it faithful to the experience of the original Sin City. However, as a whole it is clearly apparent that the movie is depending on the style rather than the substance. Still for the fans, it is an interesting visit back to the tales of Basin City.Full Review:As I mentioned it's been ages for this sequel/prequel/everything-in-between-quel to come out. I loved Sin City back in 2005, so A Dame to Kill For was long overdue. I must admit because of the wait my excitement for the movie was minimal, but I went in thinking ""a good movie is a good movie, no matter when it comes out."" Now there is a lot to like about this movie. The style is consistent through and through, and it is still gorgeous to see it on the big screen. I don't praise 3D very often but it really works well here to make the images pop. The action has also been scaled up with more gratuitous violence. The individual story lines were intriguing albeit not all on the same level. Some of the plot lines were definitely weaker but still enjoyable. There are some new characters like Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Ava the Dame (Eva Green). Both of them are great additions to the already large and stellar cast. Marv (Mickey Rourke) from the original is back and he is still the best part of the movie. Other older characters do return and there is no weak link in them (including some of the re-casts). Also there were some surprise cameos, it was nice to see them play some of the many flawed characters of Basin City for a short period.Despite it being quite faithful to what made Sin City so special, I can't possibly say that A Dame to Kill For lives up to the same measure. The main reason for that is because this time around there are lot less memorable character moments. I'm not saying there are no character voice overs, those are there in droves. But none of them have the same impact, it just felt like they were stating the obvious of what's happening. It quickly became narration rather than inner monologues that showed us more about the characters.All in all, I enjoyed Sin City: A Dame to Kill For. Sure it's not as great as the original, but it didn't need to be. The fans of this world like myself, will have a kick out of it. So if you see as yourself as such, then for sure go check it out. For others, give it a shot if you have time and some spare change in your piggy bank.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
129,CowherPowerForever,She's A Dame to Kill For,7,25 August 2014,"Without the originality of the first film, this film will likely rub a large portion of the audience the wrong way. However, the film still delivers a perfect setting and a nice story. The action is just as over he top as the previous film as well. A step down from the previous film no doubt but, still a very good effort. This is my review of Sin City: A Dame to Kill For.Frank Miller returns to write this sequel based on the graphic novel he wrote. While I have never read his graphic novels, I did enjoy his effort laid out in the first film. The films feels slower in the middle part of the film. The story arc that features Josh Brolin(Dwight) is weak in my opinion, and drags on far too long. The start of the film is nicely action packed with Mickey Rourke returning as Marv, and in my opinion, Rourke steals the show in this film. The end of the film does pick up in terms of a good story, which ends nicely. As I said, this film in not on the same level as the first film that was released nearly a decade ago. The style is still nice to see but, it lost some of its gem over that long period of time. Miller writes a good story for the most part, and he deserves to get credit for that.The film was directed by Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez. Rodriguez is a pretty popular director these days having recently directed Machete Kills(Machete sequel) and Planet Terror. Combined these two provide a fantastic action and gore filled film. The film does tend to slow down in terms of action towards the middle of the film but, is saved by some of the bigger sequences at the end of the film. While some call the idea unoriginal or a rehash, I find the rehashing just fine. Rinse and repeat works in my opinion, as long as you can still deliver a nice story to go with the visuals. Mickey Rourke is back in this sequel as Marv, and Rourke dominates his role. He is such a joy to see back on the big screen. New actors to this sequel are Josh Brolin(Dwight), Joseph Gordon-Levitt(Johnny), Eva Green(Ava) and smaller roles for Ray Liotta(Joey), Christopher Meloni(Mort), and Christopher Lloyd(Kroenig). Brolin is a very good actor in my opinion but, I felt his acting was fairly wooden. Which in turn hurts his part of the story as I mentioned above. Eva Green is a delight to watch(for many reasons), and she holds her own nicely throughout the film. Having a screen legend like Christopher Lloyd was a great sight as well. For the acting Miller and Rodriguez are able to squeezes some nice performances out of these talented actors. They also deliver a nice style of film that we are use to seeing from the previous film but, they really don't add anything different. Both directors get a good rating for this film.Robert Rodriguez and Carl Thiel are the composers for this film. Rodriguez has composed for his films in the past like Machete Kills and Spy Kids: All the Time in the World. Thiel also helped to composed Machete Kills as well as Spy Kids with Rodriguez. While I can't honestly say the effort is great their effort is pretty good overall. Not really a leap over the first film, which brings my rating for them down since once again no originality. Overall though, their effort is good enough to make the high impact action scenes very nice to watch.In closing, fans of the first film, like myself, will at some point go see this film. Those who haven't watched the first film, I have to say there is no need to rush out and see this film. Catching up on the first film until this film hits home video is the best option. Even fans of the first film might want to play it safe and wait for home video release. The effort is not bad at all, the film is fun and a joy to watch don't get me wrong but, spending ten dollars or even more(if you want 3D0, doesn't seem like a good option to me.7/10",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For

131,ahegde3149,A mundane and unoriginal rehash of the predecessor,4,19 May 2015,"Sin City: A Dame to Kill For follows the same style of its predecessor. It has nothing new to offer and immensely lacks the intensity of the first film. The effects here much better make it feel more unreal than what already is. Again based on the comics, the Miller and Robert try to cash on the success of the first film and they fail. The only silver lining to this one is the character of Marv and Eva Green's acting. We also have Joseph Gordon Levitt as lucky gambler in the town who gets into trouble when he crosses road with the senator. Eva Green plays Ava, a manipulative woman, who first tricks Dwight (if you remember him, played by Josh Brolin this time though). Ava is the dame to kill for here and Eva Green pulls off another great act after her performance in 300 : Rise of Empire (coincidentally both sequels to Miller's comic-book based film). Jessica Alba is also there who has nothing more to do than dancing at Kadie's. Only in the last few minutes we get to see her in some action. The stories are less interesting and so are the characters this time around. The only parts enjoyed was the once involving Marv or Ava. All the brutal and stylish action in black & white felt new in the first film. This is just a poor rehash. If you are a hardcore fan of the first film, you may end up liking it as you will get to see more of the violent action again (honestly the action here is quite a lot less violent and impact). If not, don't bother.RATING: [2/5]",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For

134,justbob1982,"Gratuitous, but visually distinctive",7,25 November 2015,"Version I saw: UK cinema release (2D)Actors: 6/10Plot/script: 5/10Photography/visual style: 8/10Music/score: 7/10Overall: 7/10I have a lot of time for Sin City 2, and its precursor. They are fantastically violent, feature cartoonish villains and repugnant heroes, but they have one key advantage: they are unique. Nothing else looks like them.Both films are based on the iconic graphic novels by Frank Miller. He was partly credited with the revolutionary change in comics that made them suitable for adults but, for me, his work has always been more adolescent than adult. Miller is actually credited as co-director of Sin City 2, but I have my doubts about his input: you are better off considering this a Robert Rodriguez film.Although Sin City 2 has an overlay of film noir, I think the greater inspiration comes from Hong Kong action cinema such as the work of John Woo. The emphasis is on high style and arch-cool, with a lot of very violent action and much more nudity than any 1940s film noir could possibly hope to get away with.As with the first Sin City, the cast is peppered with stars. Some return for the sequel, and I am slightly disappointed by the absence of Clive Owen when Jessica Alba has been brought back despite her career dipping considerably in the 10 years since the original. The main new entrants are Eva Green (whose frequent nudity is so gratuitous that they had to make it a plot point), Josh Brolin (replacing Owen) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. I generally like JGL, but in light of plot developments in the film, I found I had little sympathy for his character. The acting in general is not bad, but it is a bit... camp. Exaggerated. In fact, this is in keeping with the rest of the film, which has a sense throughout of over-the-topness.Yes, it can be a bit dumb, and at times totally preposterous, but I found that rather enjoyable, on a comedic level. There are more outright laughs in Sin City 2 than in many a pure comedy. Yes, it's not as good as the first Sin City, but there is still plenty to enjoy. Just sit back, let your brain go to sleep, and your eyes feast on the unique visuals.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
135,vitachiel,Enjoyable entertainment for all ages,8,14 September 2014,"Nothing can top the first Sin City movie, which is a masterpiece that can never be copied, remade or emulated. Sin City was the ultimate in coolness, cinematography and directing. A Dame To Kill For is a great movie, but in many respects it is not on a par with the first movie: the acting, the dialogs, the editing, the laughs... Some scenes drag on a bit, the use of coloring isn't anything near subtle anymore and the story lines are less powerful. Josh Brolin doesn't have the charisma of a Clive Owen or Bruce Willis. And lacking are the super weird bad guys, like Kevin and the Yellow Bastard. The women are not as bad-ass (although they show some impressive sword skills :) Eva Green a dame to kill for? Well, in Casino Royale maybe. Here, her acting and magnetism is surpassed by her bodily attraction (which is easy considering the fact that she is stark naked for most of her screen time).But let's stop complaining, there's plenty to rejoice in here. Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Johnny kicks in a fabulous performance. Marv is enjoying himself thoroughly, making the viewer having a field day as well. For the rest, curvaceous dames, kick-ass fighting and noir alleyways abound.The breathtaking photography is greatly enhanced by 3D. Give me more of this!",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
136,derek-duerden,Good Fun,8,11 November 2018,"I saw the original Sin City quite a while back and honestly can't remember many of the characters - just that I enjoyed it.
Similarly, this was a fun ride. However, if I were Jessica Alba I would probably have lobbied for reshoots or for it not to be released at all. She is *completely* acted off the screen by Eva Green and even Juno Temple (who gets minimal airtime) leaves a much more lasting impression.
Accordingly, the ""climactic"" final segment feels like a poor and underwhelming ending relative to what had gone before - where most of the acting was fine and the tone of a ""noir for the 21st century"" was admirably maintained.
Definitely worth a look if you enjoyed the first one.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
137,StonedMagician,Good: 7.0,7,29 July 2019,"In this film's defense, despite being a sequel made a full nine years after the original, and even despite doing absolutely nothing new, it still feels somewhat fresh. There really isn't much else like Sin City, but that also means that there's only one film to compare it to, and this one is worse. For starters, it just isn't paced as well. Unlike the 2005 original, A Dame to Kill For switches between action and dialogue rather erratically, mitigating much of the narrative impact the first film had. And although much was made of the fact that two of the subplots were created exclusively for this movie, they don't gel at all with the comic-based ones, leading the first one to feel inconsequential and the second tacked-on. The acting and visuals are commendable, and the atmosphere is undeniable, but that's not enough to wholly redeem this somewhat disappointing sequel. It's not bad by any means, but I was expecting a whole lot more.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For

Normally I would be against goryness, slicing of throats etc., however the actual blood was replaced by white substance. I asked my friend if the whole film would be in black and white(Not in the olden style). So that's a plus. We were treated to narrating. From what I could gather A stripper(Don't know her name) wanted revenge on Senator Roark(Boothe). Johnny(Gordon-Levitt) wanted revenge as Roark killed Johnny's girlfriend. Ava(Green) wants to get back with Dwight(Brolin). However it is found that she's wanting to kill him etc., So while the plot was kind misleading for me personally, I thought it was cool. Graphics was most impressive. One thing I'm glad though was with the amount blood curdling and spillage etc., that it was all covered by means of white substance. Although my friend told me that you don't need to see the first Sin City, My advise I think you should. Cause I was completely lost.

139,sohansurag,"A Hugely Disappointing Sequel, not worth the wait!",5,15 September 2014,"Robert Rodriguez's Sin City was one of my favorite movies at the time (2005) and still remains so. The first thing that comes into my mind when I think of it is ""SLICK"", its smooth and a pleasure to look at and at its core its the brilliant graphic novel by Frank Miller. Rodriguez used the graphics novel panels for the storyboards and it works like a charm. Frank Miller's graphic novel in itself is a piece of fine art and its movie counterpart, a commendable and striking neo-noir visual extravaganza that told its story through gritty visuals, a ton of monologues, sex and violence, extraordinaire. I was hooked the instant I'd seen the Sin City preview with The Servant's Cells track, on many levels it was one of the best trailers I'd ever seen.Cut to 2014 and we realize it has taken about a decade for the Sin City sequel and the anticipation was definitely high. While Sin City was based on the 6th book in the series, Booze, Broads & Bullets, A Dame to Kill For was based on A Dame To Kill For along with two original stories written exclusively for the movie by Frank Miller. I myself am a die hard fan of the graphic novels and I still remember avariciously reading through the books relishing each frame.Sin City was built on its arresting visual style, a great monochrome palette with colors red, yellow, blue that contrasts against it and a great story to boot. A Dame to Kill For follows suit but with a weak script it tries desperately to entertain you and fails. Even with the same visual wizardry A Dame to Kill For quickly falls flat because the novelty wears off a few minutes into the movie. I was rather excited when the titles rolled in, panels and characters from the graphic novel animated in 3D, wow, that was a sight for sore eyes. Yes at times the movie looks stunning, like it'd just pounced from Miller's acclaimed comic panels but it only proves that only visuals cant make a good movie.And talk about the stories itself, the adapted material stands out and the originals comes off as the weak point here especially the last sequence, Nancy's Last Dance. I wouldn't complain had it been Jessica Alba gyrating throughout the sequence but unfortunately the section is the weakest and acted as a filler. The movie starts with Just Another Saturday Night, stars Marv and he's his usual bad-ass self here. The Long Bad Night, another original tells the story of Johnny, a gambler who goes against none other than Senator Roarke. A Dame to Kill For moves in typical Sin City fashion re-introducing Dwight and keeps you intrigued a bit until it drags us till its end.The performances were decent enough with Joseph Gordon Levitt and Mickey Rourke taking a front seat. Josh Brolin replaces Clive Own as Dwight and does a good job. Eva Green plays the Dame in question and she does what she does best. No not showing her assets off. Well, that and she kinda reprises the same role from 300 Rise of an Empire. Powers Booth plays the villain in most of story lines yet he didn't seem as intimidating as the antagonists in the first movie. Jessica Alba, yea she's there too (read ""meh""). There were cameos aplenty, with Bruce Willis, Ray Liota, Rosario Dawson and Jamie Chung. Oh btw, thank the ever wonderful Indian Censor-board to chop off around 20 minutes due to nudity. I wouldn't have bothered with nudity, the thing is those 10- 20 minutes also had trivial plot- points without which the story felt bland. After all what's a Sin City movie without sex, drugs and violence?I am disappointed as this much awaited sequel doesn't even come close to the original. Sin City will be remembered as one of the best graphic novel adaptations by Rodiguez/Miller/Tarantino. A Dame to Kill For on the other hand will be forgotten in a couple of days. Watch it for the visuals had you not watched the first, then again, watch Sin City on Blu-ray and forget that a sequel had ever been released.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
140,FlorianLaur,Doesn't have the same feel to it...,7,6 June 2020,"Tricky to review this movie...after seeing part 1, I was blown away, finally a comic adaption that wasn't some cheesy fantasy trope. It felt over the top, but oozed style and was uber-cool, also thanks to the good cast.That's where some of the trouble starts...the cast...one could argue it isn't the directors fault some of them died. But from what I read, it is Angelina Jolie's...I read they kept delaying filming for her and after years and years, she finally would have been available, but lost interest!
Seeing how they have waited for her, they should have waited for Devon Aoki. The new Miho seems strange (clearly taller, etc). The new Manute did a decent job, Dennis Haysbert didn't seem that different from M.C. Duncan.Jessica Alba also has aged(obviously). Again, we go back to the issue of how late this sequel came out. I think it would have been a lot better if it had come out 2-3 years after the first, but almost 10? It's a bit like the Matrix movie that also suffered from the fact that many movies had copied their style, making it less unique when the new parts came out.On the plus side, we did get to know a bit about the back stories of some of the characters, although people might be a bit confused with the different time lines.
What the story of Johnny was good for though, I'm not quite sure of (although the actor did a good job).All in all, it isn't a terrible movie. It just lacks that special something part 1 had.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For

142,stephenlovelette,Only Slightly Disappointing,7,24 August 2014,"Sigh.It's an injustice when critics refer to Sin City as a 'cult classic.'Likewise 'campy' denotes a lack in quality, and is an unfit qualifier for the first film.A Dame to Kill For isn't as good as its predecessor. Therefore if a group arises to defend their equality, it's fair to deem the sequel 'camp.'Dame is not bad. It has many redeeming qualities.But overall, AD2K4 is underwhelming.Part of the problem involves the visuals.Why didn't they release it in IMAX? The larger screen and better sound could help.I can't put my finger on it, but something's different about the shooting style between the two movies. The visuals are sharper, less gritty, and that's not a good thing.The clarity lends the settings/backdrops a more artificial feel. The environment feels cartoonish; not 'lived in' or 'real.'What happened with the editing? Seriously.Why weren't the filmmakers more generous to Jessica Alba?The first film has an iconic two-minute scene of her dancing on-stage, but it's mostly background to Hardigan's (Bruce Willis) activity. The camera-work is elaborate, tasteful and never self-indulgent.It's as if the fans cried for more dancing Jessica, and the filmmakers way overcompensated. They're building story with the nuances of strip teasing, but the performance is unconvincing.Who deserves the blame? Why didn't they do multiple takes? Why didn't Alba prep better? After finishing the rough cut, didn't the directors realize the stripping feels excessive? Where's the stylistic panning, the cutaways, the slow-motion?Why didn't they re-shoot the boozing scenes? Who didn't have time for whom? I want to know!Ugh. Disappointing.There's way too much voice-over. Characters are constantly telling the audience unnecessary details.If only things were a little bit tighter. Less voice-over, more background extras.Other than the dancing and drinking, Alba's acting is pretty good.In fact, the entire cast is strong. Each thespian manages to fit the tone of the movie (except Julia Garner.)That doesn't include the 'under fives' (characters with less than five lines) however.The frat boys are particularly alien. They oversell the frustration, the weirdness and the 'douchiness' (I guess?) that 'frat boys' are supposed to emulate.If you can't tell, I feel slighted by the open, in which 'frat boys' with an eye for 'brand names' are associated with disrepute. This is a tired cliché, and a feeble attempt at social commentary.One of the characters actually says, ""I have a trust fund!"" while begging for his life.Bobby, Franky; come on, guys. Nobody talks like that.I'm curious to know why Clive Owen didn't reprise his role as Dwight.Josh Brolin accomplishes the job sufficiently. But is it possible the sequel suffers without Clive?Absolutely. It's just one more source of unnecessary confusion.Bruce Willis, a protagonist and highlight from the first, returns as a supporting character and doesn't disappoint.Joseph Gordon-Levitt's rock-solid as usual. That goes for Mickey Rourke, too.Along with a cameo in A Million Ways to Die in the West, Christopher Lloyd appears twice on the summertime big screen (both times as a doctor, no less).Lady Gaga was a minor disappointment. Small as it is, she doesn't sell the waitress role.Eva Green, on the other hand, buys the pie. Her performance as Ava Lord is rather impressive. She does a good job of selling a tough role and her character is the single greatest redeeming quality of the sequel.Second place goes to how it illustrates the metaphysical nature of the city's location.Sure it's noir L.A., but it's also a weird sort of limbo in which archetypal anti-heroes congregate and intermingle.The allegorical environment's a phantasmal depot for sinners caught in the cycle of criminality.Think about it, man.When considering both flicks from that perspective, the sequel becomes much more thought- provoking.The action's pretty good; some moments are downright fantastic.All in all, Dame 2K 4 is inferior to its predecessor, yet contains enough enchanting moments, compelling character interactions and violent mystique to satisfy fans.See it if you like the first. Just don't expect much.There's no stinger after the credits, so you can leave once they start to roll.Perhaps Sin City 3 will make up for lost ground.If Eva Green reprises her role, they've got a shot at turning things around.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For

But overall, it is still an enjoyable follow up, to one of my personal favorite films. Much like the first film, Sin City: A Dame to Kill For presents another gorgeous glimpse of Frank Miller's Basin City. This film is trying to serve us a sequel, and prequel to 2005's Sin City. The result, I personally find to be a little jumbled. Such as, the story going back and forth.Just like the first Sin City; this film highly succeeds with cinematography and amazing visuals. Also, I feel like Frank Miller & Robert Rodriguez put more focus into Dwight's (Josh Brolin) story, and character development, than the other characters. For example, most of the side actors/characters come in and out without really much of an effect of the story.The acting is once again done very well. This movie truly does have an all star cast.

The GORES here are somewhat violent but a lot less creative and stylish and got tamer this time around. The story here is quite poorly paced and not as quite engaging and interesting to follow even though we get to know more (dull) background from each character this time around. However, Eva Green definitely steals the show here with more bad-ass and sexiness added to the character and really helps making the film more watchable than it is, also she is up for some SCARE as well. Overall, if you never seen the first film, there's still some stylish FUN, thrill, blood, and (lots of sex) to enjoy but other than that if you did see the first film, this one is a huge disappointment in almost every element and makes this film seems like a straight-to-DVD movie >>C<<",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For

One of these movies, that are something new and different from the rest(The Matrix, Kick Ass, Lord of War, etc). Sin City 1's strong points were the visuals, the strange tale it told, and the awesome cast (all actors delivering their best)Now they made a sequel. I've been waiting a long time for it! The visuals are still great and original. Well done!! The actors are good (I'm not picky).What was missing? Suspense and an engaging story. That's it. There was no thrill in that movie. Remember last time when Miho chopped off arms? That was something. Now it was just slice and dice and over! Benicio del Toro? Wow did he have epic screen time. The speech with his throat open? So funny and intense at the same time. Years later I still wanna imitate his hoarse voice from when he said: ""Whatcha gonna do when you run outta gas, call triple A?"" :-)Awesome!!Sin City 2 lacked these scenes completely. Powers Booth was great, but it didn't help!So you see my disappointment? I gave it six stars. It should be seven, but it cost one star to re-introduce characters into the story that were (supposed to be) dead. Marv? Did he survive the electrocution? Come on! And is he superman? In Sin City one he got wounded'n stuff. He got shot at multiple times, but they didn't even bother showing any sign of damage. (I'm nitpicking now) And for wasting characters like Joseph Gordon's. Such a build-up so he can go back and let himself be shot in the head? Argh!!I'm done. Mr Rodriguez, I love your work, but both your most recent movies lacked the same elements (Machete had the same problems.

When it comes to the story itself I personally didn't enjoyed it as much as the first movie especially that with Joseph Gordon-Levitt, that one seemed really pointless. The main story and the one that gives this movie his name was acceptable and the last story gave closure about a previous story. It lacks the brilliant narration of the characters thoughts that the first one had, this still has it but in a minor quantity and without the poetry that the first one had that should be also due to the change of writers because the overall writing in this one felt worst. The action scenes were good but again not as enjoyable as in the first movie and not as violent too.

151,j-madej,A mixture of comic book graphic novel violence and film noir might be a killer combination indeed you've been waiting for.,8,7 September 2014,"As I mentioned before in one of my previous reviews Hollywood hates filmmakers who can do it all, ""Jack of all traits"" so to speak...""and master of none"" they always like to add. Years ago when I did a study at The Los Angeles Film School one of my instructors from cinematography told us a story, that apparently when Rodriguez was shooting Desperado he wanted to operate steady cam. For less knowledgeable in film techniques and gear, steady cam allows the camera operator freedom to move around as he pleases. The camera is mounted onto a harness that camera operator wears and it can be quite awkward and heavy depending on the weight of the camera. Supposedly Rodriguez while filming lost balance and ran into a wall destroying the camera in the process. This fact became a huge embarrassing story to tell to the students and industry insiders and to warn them from trying to do more than one job on the set. Now what most people forget that Rodriguez before his Hollywood debut in ""Desperado"" made a small independent movie for $7.000 called ""El mariachi"" which eventually was made into a bigger Hollywood production called ""Desperado"". On ""El mariachi"" Robert Rodriguez was a producer, director, writer, special- effect man, etc, the only job he didn't do was act, as there would be no one else to operate the camera. This is how he learned how to make movies. By self teaching himself on how to do things, which I can identify with in the creation of my feature film ""11"" where I had to wear more hats than one if you know what I mean. Robert Rodriguez admitted himself that ""El mariachi"" was made to be a ""practice"" student film so to speak. If you can make a feature film by yourself then you will be an unstoppable force once you have a bigger budget and other talented filmmakers to collaborate with. However in Hollywood there is a union system that forbids the director to do more than one job on the movie. It is understood in a way, that by doing more then one set job you are taking away potential position of the crew who otherwise would be well paid for their job. This philosophy has driven Rodriguez out of Hollywood to Texas to start his own production company Troublemaker Studios where he resides till today. Due to the fact that ""Frank Miller's Sin City: A Dame to Kill For"" is the most expensive movie Rodriguez ever made with estimated budget of $60 million he needed to team up with other production companies like Miramax Films just to be able to realize his vision.Now from box office records this film was a huge failure making so far in USA alone around $12,005,060. I do think it will make better box office in the world wide distribution, specially in Europe where people know good things when they see it and are little less willing to jump on the bandwagon of bad press. The fact is that Rodriguez here is in total control of this movie being co-director, cinematographer. producer and editor all molded in one. I love that! Yes sometimes this type of multitasking can be dangerous for the project because you might lose that clarity and objectivity over the film, but in the case of Rodriguez this is not his first rodeo as they say and in my humble opinion he delivers a very capable sequel to already a film noir cult classic from many ears ago. I did enjoy this sequel and maybe more so than the original and it is not because Eva Green beautiful breasts are here to be admired in almost every scene she is in but perhaps because this version is more polished and to some extend has a better storyline than the previous film. This might be to the credit of Frank Miller who stepped up not only as a writer but as a co-director of this chapter of the franchise. All the performances are stylistically believable and there are some new additions with characters played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Eva Green and Josh Brolin who replaced Clive Owen. All in all if you liked the style of the previous film you will definitely not be disappointed by ""Frank Miller's Sin City: A Dame to Kill For"" so go and check this one in 3D. They don't make this type of movies no more and this installment, a mixture of comic book graphic novel violence and film noir might be a killer combination indeed you've been waiting for.For more of my reviews please go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
152,LJStephens1980,After a long wait...very good to be in Sin City again!!!,10,30 October 2014,"There is no justice without sin....a very promising tag-line.Sin City 2 encompasses 5 stories, that follow some famous, and other not so famous residents of Basin City.Just Another Saturday Night, The Long Bad Night (Part I), ""A Dame to Kill For"", ""The Long Bad Night (Part II)"", and ""Nancy's Last Dance"". Just Another Saturday Night, documents in a very funny way, how Marv, (Mickey Rourke) acquired a certain Bernini coat. The Long Bad Night (Part I) is a two part story focusing on an entirely new character in the Sin City universe, named Johnny (Joseph Gordon Levitt), a gambler, with a secret mission.A Dame to Kill For, the main story: reveals that years before ""The Big Fat Kill"", Dwight McCarthy (Josh Brolin), works as a P.I, and is trying to contain his inner demons, and would give any thing to get out of the numbing hell that his life has become. Dwight receives an unexpected phone call from his former lover Ava Lord (Eva Green), who left Dwight four years prior for a wealthy tycoon, Damian Lord (Marton Csokas), pleading for his help. It should be noted that Ava Lord, (Eva Green, totally stunning), has ulterior motives. Dwight with assist from Marv, get more than they bargain for. That Ava has lied, about her husband, thanks Dwight before shooting him. Marv has a huge fight with Manute (Dennis Haysbert), which is certainly destined for the history books. Marv and Dwight escape to Old town, Dwight's old flame, Gail (Rosario Dawson), recognizes him and saves his life. With the help of Gail and the deadly assassin Miho (Jamie Chung), Dwight undergoes reconstructive surgery on his face and plots his revenge.Dwight (with his reconstructed new face), accompanied by Gail and Miho, poses as Wallenquist's man from Phoenix. Inside Ava's estate, however, Manute sees past the new face and captures Dwight. Gail and Miho strike from Dwight's car, and Dwight shoots Manute with a hidden .25 he had up his left sleeve. Six bullets fail to kill him, and Manute aims shakily at Dwight as Ava unexpectedly grabs one of Manute's guns, shooting Manute several times. She attempts to convince Dwight to pair with her, and that the pain he suffered revealed his true intentions, but Dwight shoots her mid-kiss, and she dies in his arms.The Long Bad Night (Part II) returns to the character of Johnny , Realizing he left Marcie unprotected, Johnny flees to her hotel, but finds the Senator waiting for him along with Marcie's dismembered head and hands. Again, the senator lets him go. Intent on taking down Roark, Johnny scrounges a dollar from a sympathetic waitress (Lady Gaga) which he uses to regain enough money playing slots to buy his way into Roark's game the following night. Playing a card shark's con, Johnny folds his first few hands, allowing Roark to taunt him about his dead mother. He once again cons Roark into going all in, and then reveals his winning hand. Johnny taunts his father, reminding him that tonight's story of how the same man beat him twice will follow him for the rest of his life. His vengeance completed, Johnny smiles resignedly as Roark dismissively shoots him in the head, commanding his men to get rid of the body.Nancy's Last Dance is the most tragic of the Sin City yarns. Set four years after ""That Yellow Bastard"", Nancy Callahan struggles to cope with John Hartigan's selfless suicide. Needless to say she is driven insane, and sets out to get her revenge, on Senator Roark. Heartbreaking work from Jessica Alba.Please don't make us wait years for Sin City 3, and other Sin City movies!!!!",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
153,liodavix,"It could have been better, it could also have been worse",7,20 September 2019,"Sin City was a real bombshell and the most masterful demonstration of how to adapt a comic or graphic novel.The film was almost perfect, a setting and aesthetic worthy of the best Black Cinema, Tarantinian narrative scheme, fascinating characters with intelligent dialogues, spectacular action sequences ..... I don't know if I exaggerate, but I consider it a Masterpiece and a true Cinema achievement.Here we have, then, the second part, and I think something has seriously failed.In itself, it is not a bad movie, but since it began, with the story of Joseph Levitt, which was the best and most interesting, and Levitt is immense and demonstrating a talent that does nothing but take hold, history is losing Some gas as it progresses. But for some reason that the story of Josh Brolin begins, something gets screwed and begins to lose its good progress from the beginning.It is still Sin City, okay, but for some reason the intensity and overwhelming force of the stories and scenes from the previous film are halved in this one. They do not produce so many emotions but in some sections it becomes a bit heavy, not boring, but the rhythm is weak and that kills the tension and the good rhythm.And above the action scenes are quite weak, for example the confrontation between Marv and the gigantic black Bodyguard, I expected a beastly melee, but everything stays in a couple of thrusts, two or three strokes, and Marv tearing the eye as if it were a plastic Barbie. This was the huge gorilla that was not Human? What a tease is that?Of all the characters that appear in this new sequel, only the aforementioned Levitt, the colossal Marv and Eva Green have been interesting. Josh Brolin has been very weak, Ray Liotta is almost not seen, Bruce Willis is a couple of Flashbacks and the rest is not much to highlight, there is no time.This time the movie is too short and there is no room to develop the rest of the characters, some are back there, but they don't say much, or tell stories with more force than those offered here.In a nutshell, this sequel is OK, it is GOOD, but it does not reach the HEIGHT even from the first, and that is something very serious. If it does not match or exceed the previous one, will it make sense to make a third?Highlight the scene of Levitt being treated by a half-crazy doctor embodied by the legendary Cristopher Lloyd. Just for that scene it was worth it.Thank you.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
154,tgrock,Underdeveloped Sequel,7,3 October 2014,"""Sin City: A Dame to Kill For"" feels like a good film that got destroyed in the editing room. The opening story is only about 10 minutes long, but feels like it should have never even been in the movie as the story goes nowhere. Large amounts of time are given to the film's 'A Dame to Kill For' and 'The Long Bad Night', but 'Nancy's Last Dance' gets the shaft. The latter of the stories should have been the most interesting and the main focus of the film. Instead, it feels like an afterthought.Many people have complained that 'The Long Bad Night'starring Joseph-Gordon Levitt is pointless. In the manner which it is presented, I'd probably have to agree. After the film's intro, 'The Long Bad Night' starts. However, it is interrupted midway through to present 'A Dame to Kill For' in its entirety. Had it not been interrupted, 'The Long Bad Night' would have been better-received, because 'A Dame to Kill For' is the most exciting of the three stories and contains the film's most climactic action.It's never a good sign for the film to have its climax in the first third of its plot line. A film should build up to it and save it for the end. That being said, 'The Long Bad Night' is the film's least climactic story and should have been shown in its entirety first. Then 'A Dame to Kill For' should have been shown next. 'Nancy's Last Dance' could have been extremely climactic. It has all the makings of story that should be. Since it is the only story connected to the first film, our emotional connection towards Nancy is pretty high. The whole story line is just not given enough time to gel, nor does its ending feel satisfactory. Part of the problem with every story is the presence of Marv (Mickey Rourke). He doesn't feel like the same character as in the first film. Mickey Rourke appears he is just going through the motions to get his pay check. His presence in 'Nancy's Last Dance' is a big mistake. The character could have fit into the story had Nancy and he had been friends. Yet, no interaction between these characters is ever shown. He just involves himself in Nancy's conflict for no good reason just as he does in 'A Dame to Kill For' as well. Another big problem with this film is that a lot of the characters feel invincible, especially Miho and Marv. Marv at least had a worthy adversary in ""Sin City"", but here is just kills people with ease. Everything feels too easy for the heroes in the film.Lastly, this film's stories feel disconnected from one another. The stories in ""Sin City"" meshed together brilliantly. Part of that had to do with every villain being connected to the Roark family. Senator Roark is the villain in two stories, while Ava Lord is the villain in the other. Senator Roark is a mediocre villain compared to Ava Lord though. Ava Lord is a menacing seductress for the film's characters as well as the film's audience as she appears naked most of the time. She is cruel and powerful. Senator Roark works well as a powerful villain in 'The Long Bad Night', but is so easily dealt with in 'Nancy's Last Dance' that he feels like just another henchman that is killed off in a second by one of the heroes.The film is not without its positives however. Besides Eva Green, the noir-style and dialogue is very pleasing, even if the CGI looks worse than the original's. The action scenes may be lacking in intensity, but everything besides these action scenes is very well- done. Luckily, the action scenes only make up probably 10% of the film. So, the rest of the film is very engrossing.That is why I still give the film a 7/10.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
155,InMyHonestOpinion,Old town rises up once again and does surprisingly well,6,26 December 2014,"Frank Miller is a master at the graphic novel and if you see his first film ""Sin City"" directed by himself and Robert Rodriguez hopefully you would agree with me. Sin City a Dame to Kill for is the second graphic novel Frank and his team have brought to life, and much like its predecessor it is dark, cold, colourless and at times a nightmarish telling of tales set within the fictitious town of Sin City and its even deadlier ""old town"" where the women rule and do what they need to keep the peace. There are about 4 stories told some in two parts and each one has its own style and grace, all 4 do cross over one another to tell a bigger tale but I won't spoil that for you just yet. Starting out we meet Marv played by Mickey Rourke (The Wrestler, Sin City) who is laying almost lifeless on the road forgetting how he got there as he stands he can see lifeless bodies of younger men lying about the place slowly he begins to get his memory back and the retelling of his earlier saga and how he came to be begins. Mickey Rourke is disgusting but in such a handsome way the character he plays is pure vile but you learn to love him and his ugliness That's just one of the stories and it is a very brief description of what exactly happens. Sin City is twisted, it is angry and non- apologetic, its colourless style brings a soft comfort for the amount of blood splatter that is thrown across the screens but it is still enough to make you twist away at times at the sufferings that go on. One of the most violent films I have ever seen but not in a ""Saw"" or ""Hostile"" kind of cheap thrills way. Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller both directed this and have done an amazing job to some extent visually. The problem lies in the stories themselves, the narration at times gets very tedious and quite annoying I found. I can understand why it is there after all it's the way films were told back in the forties where of course this fictitious town is set. There just wasn't enough to keep me captivated it's comic book style seemed relentless and I couldn't help but wonder why they wouldn't change the style for each scenario, just to give it that little bit of difference, it would be enough to bring each story to life in its own unique style. The cast was outstanding and so very large this film has everyone from the original and a few more to add to the punch even some of those that died. Starring Mickey Rourke, Jessica Alba, Josh Brolin, Joseph Gordon Levitt, Rosaria Dawson, Bruce Willis, Powers Boothe, Ray Liotta and even Lady Gaga just to name a few. The characters are supposed to be bad to which every one of them is, there wasn't a single nice character in the entire film, which I'll admit I did love. Everyone was so bad they could be nothing more than brilliant. As I said before the story is what let this down, it is pretty much just a recycled version of the original nothing new to add nothing new to make it stand out on its own. Not one for the kiddies!!!",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
156,swellframe17,A repeat of the first one that doesn't expand on the universe the first one set up.,5,22 August 2014,"This review contains spoilers about this film and ""Sin City.""The Sin City universe is a film noir character's dream. It's a cynical world filled with betrayal, sex, and violence. Shadows always reach out and steal what they can from their surroundings. Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) sums it up when he says ""Sin City's where you go in with your eyes open, or you don't come out at all."" Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller captured the essence of this darkness in ""Sin City."" The sequel/prequel to this film is ""Sin City: A Dame To Kill For"" and it finds this darkness again, but doesn't take it much further. ""Sin City: A Dame To Kill For"" continues to follow Marv (Mickey Rourke), Dwight (played by Josh Brolin instead of Clive Owen this time), Nancy (Jessica Alba), and introduces Johnny. Marv, Dwight, and Nancy's story lines are repeats of the first one. You don't really learn anything new about them. The film recaptures the essence of their character, but it's just a redo. It doesn't take them anywhere new. We've already seen these characters murder and sleep with other characters. They have cliché lines and follow cliché stories. From a story standpoint, the film gets boring. However, Johnny's story is really good. Gordon-Levitt has the charm and grit that made the first one good. His storyline deserves a better rating, but this segment doesn't get as much screen time. Gordon-Levitt uses his time well though. What I liked about the first ""Sin City"" is how it was a series of vignettes with a bookend segment that was effective. Rodriquez and Miller's storytelling gets disorganized in ""Sin City: A Dame To Kill For."" We bounce around different story lines instead of just following them one at a time. It doesn't work well with this film. The beginning and end jump around. Dwight's story dominates the middle of the film, but I thought it was a weak segment filled with way too many clichés. Some characters from the first return throughout this film like Gail (Rosario Dawson) and Hartigan (Bruce Willis), but they serve mostly as useless cameos.From a visual standpoint, this film looks really good. It has cool and bloody visual effects and has that same grit look the first one had. The film doesn't expand on the visuals of the first one though. Rodriguez and Miller don't use colors as consistently and effectively as they did in the first one. They get caught up in the sex and violence. There are visual motifs like eye wounds and falling and themes of betrayal in all of them, but they get buried down in exaggerated violence and sex. There are a lot of scenes of Eva Green topless and Jessica Alba dancing as stripper. Many heads fly off and many bullets are fired. The film is bigger and more over the top than the first one, but it doesn't have that same punch. It just feels ridiculous and boring. ""Sin City: A Dame To Kill For"" is worth seeing because of Johnny's segment. It is the most original storyline in the film and is anchored by a strong performance from Gordon-Levitt. I wish they would have included it in the first film. It's probably my favorite storyline of both films. The rest of the film is just a repeat of the first one. It doesn't expand on the first one like a good sequel/prequel should do. You should stick with the first one for the most part.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
157,jan_kalina,"""Do me one last favor, lover. Stay still long enough for me to blow your brains out.""",10,29 September 2014,"Robert Rodriguez didn't make a good film since the first Sin City in 2005. Now after nine years he is back and Sin City is better than before. What bothered in the first film was the Clive Owen story The Big Fat Kill. For some reason it seemed to me that story didn't fit the tone of the other stories.Sin City: A Dame to Kill For was exactly what we needed in cinemas. The film is violent in the right way, you care about the characters just enough to get pulled into the story. The film is not noir because those times are gone, we will never got another Raymond Chandler or Dashiell Hammett but I guess this is a fine replacement for this generation. Let's call it modern noir or neo-noir.All actors exactly fit their roles. Mickey Rourke's Marv doesn't get much screen time though but Rourke was always great at these types of roles. Josh Brolin is more suitable as Dwight, he has shown already that he is excellent at playing hard edge gritty loners. Joseph Gordon Levitt is always amazing and his story where he acts as a cocky young gambler is one of the best in the film. Jessica Alba pulls off just fine the stripper Nancy who never strips. Nancy obsessed with vengeance seems at first that it will be a ridiculous task for Alba but she surprises how well she pulled off that side of her character. Which brings me to the best actor in this film. Eva Green absolutely steals the show for herself. By her enigmatic presence which just which sends out sexy vibes but on the other hand also this uncertain vibe where you might get stabbed in the back by her. Eva Green has made herself a name as the evil mysterious woman. The title story is also the best one all thanks to Brolin's and Green's outstanding performances.Rodriguez once again what a fun filmmaker he was and still is. He just can't go around picking these garbage ideas. Sin City: A Dame to Kill For is well spent time at the movies. A hard boiled characters filling up a no good town, doing to each other nothing but bad deeds. Dames are hot but deadly, men are tough, not talking too much just the occasional tough one-liner. If these kind of places, stories are your thing then head back to Sin City",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
158,dunnypop,Couldn't finish the movie,7,2 October 2014,"Maybe I'll finish this one day... but as of now I think I got through half of the film. First off, I LOVED Sin City (the movie and comics). I owned the Sin City DVD, then special edition DVD and then special edition blu ray... I also have a Marv bobble head (remember those?).When I heard that Sin City 2 was being made, I was excited... then 9 years passed. Now we have Sin City A Dame to Kill For. It's directed by Rodriguez and Frank Miller. Rodriguez is a stylish and use to be a fantastic director. Frank Miller... he writes comic books.OK this sums up how inconsistent the pacing of the film is and how inconsistent it is to the original. This happens within the first few minutes of the film... Marv, not sure where he is, then recaps what just happens to him where he goes to a strip bar, gets into a fight, hunts down these thugs, steals a cop car, tracks down these thugs to the projects, blows up cars... this happens in maybe 3 minutes of the film.... It felt WAY too comical. Way too Machete 2 like.Then the pacing of the film slows down to Joseph Gordon Levitt, who is perfect for the film and feel of the film. The real noir of Sin City... and then it jumps to Dwight and then Jessica Alba and then back to Marv and then back to Joseph etc...Some of the stories have ridiculous pacing while others are slowed down. It's stylish but out dated as the first Sin City was 9 years ago. There's nothing new here except for the awful pacing.Maybe I'll finish this movie one day, but for now I had a taste and need to drown it out with some whiskey.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
159,videodrome1234,Not bad but the first....,6,21 August 2014,"It's been almost 9 years since Frank Miller and Robert Rodrigez gave us something that even if it wasn't for too long, was the cause of many a surprised intake of breath. The first part of Sin City tried it's hand at a genre that was almost considered dead, the film noir and it did so successfully and also it adapted a comic book's visuals in a way that before it we all thought was impossible. The film looked unbelievably good and the story was fantastic. It ran along a few story lines that all came together well because of the characters and the interesting, twisted and really brutal story. Sin City was a comic book film that wanted to be more and was. What was even more surprising was that the film was even monetarily successful, which of course meant that the gossip mill started up about a sequel and like it sometimes happens they just kept putting it off again and again. There was a positive and a negative side to this, one the creators only started working on it when they really had something good to give us story and visuals wise. Negative because there was a stable fan base that was waiting for a sequel, but the wait is over, it just took 9years. That may have been an error I mean in the past 9 years others have tried similar things (not with much success) and it's a new generation now that the sequel has to pull into the movies not just the original fans. But of course this will only matter when looking at how much the film will make and not so much with its quality. The film is again a few parallel stories that of course meet on a few points and not just to each other but to the first film too, but don't worry the film makers made sure that if someone didn't see the first part they can still enjoy the second. We get a few characters back like Bruce Willis's and Jessica Alba's oh and Mickey Rourke. But we get new characters too played by Eva Green and Josh Brolin and Joseph Gordon Levitt. The basic concept is the same as the first film minus a few changes here and there. But the devil is in the details. Unfortunately the films biggest problem comes out when you compare it to the two biggest values of the first film. First the films visuals. It hasn't changed. It's exactly like the 10 year old film. On the one hand that's great, cause it worked back then but that was 9 years ago, not being able to add to the visuals, modernize them, not so good. Back then the visuals were impressive, unique and genius, now it's just nostalgia. That's not really the films fault though cause you know what could they have done differently right? But when the magician pulls the rabbit out of the hat we clap, but if the next trick is the same thing well not so much. The second thing is the story or stories. The really good stories from the first not only couldn't be topped but really they couldn't be copied either. That doesn't mean the stories were bad, just not as hard hitting as in the first part. Because of these two things Sin City 2 kind of makes me feel like it didn't end up being bad or anything it's just that it's a typical 2nd part and maybe they shouldn't have bothered. It was nowhere near the first part. But I really am not saying that it's bad it's still a lot better than 70 % of films getting sent to the movies now a days. Powers Boothe and Jessica Alba's characters are great, the dialogue is too and Rodrigez shows he's a good director when he's not messing around with Spy Kids. But the first part was better. All in all Sin City 2 will be an enjoyable film for those who liked the first and Rodrigez fans, it just isn't better than the first, but then again what is that really blew us away back in 2005. So it's a 6/10 https://www.youtube.com/user/silverscreenreviews1",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
160,thedukeofmovietown,"Good... but for 9 years in the making, not acceptable.",6,14 September 2014,"I saw SIN CITY 2! I took a while longer to review this movie because I wasn't sure what to think of it. On the plus side, Robert Rodriguez really did a good job adapting Frank Miller's ultra gritty, hyper stylized, noir-ish graphic novel to the big screen. The acting was great too and it brought in some of the biggest names in the game to do the work. I think the editing and the stories themselves are what made me pause in this movie. For one thing, all the stories are out of order, even in context to the first Sin City film. Some stories occur before, some after and some exist on an alternate timeline. This can be very confusing if you're looking for things to sync up with the first film so it's best that you just consider this movie it's own thing. Another off thing about this movie is it's flow. In the first sin city, although it was comprised of a few different stories, it all fit together. The pace was even and it left you with a good feeling overall. This movie, on the other hand, has a lot of loose strings in it. The stories have a lot of extraneous characters and more than once I found myself saying, ""hmm...well that went nowhere."" All in all, this movie really is better than it appears. I'm sure that if it were cobbled together with the first film somehow it would be better or if this were a series of small internet shorts it would be exceptional, but as it stands in movie form, it just feels eating a four course meal of good food that doesn't go together like spaghetti & sushi or ice cream and collard greens. In the end it's great but it's just so thoroughly disorganized and for a movie 9 years in the making, it's just not acceptable. Still, I'll give Sin City a 3...out of 5.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For

While I definitely love the first and it will be a classic, iconic, cult hit for generations to come this was a great sequel that does not deserve some of the hateful remarks, yet everyone is entitled to their opinion. The simplest of the 3D is what blew me away. Take note of the smoky rooms and the falling snow. It truly looks as if it is all around you. It wasn't the usual bullet or weapon flying at your face routine. It was those subtle touches that added the quality. I for one enjoyed the story line. I watched the movies back to back and that added even more to the viewing experience. Don't let the haters sway you away from this. Check it out yourself.

162,ben-798-604758,Cheap Brand Exploitation,4,8 December 2014,"This film is proof that Hollywood execs will try to squeeze every last drop of marketing potential from any brand, and beat a dead horse till its more puddle than horse. Don't get me wrong, sin city was a cinematic masterpiece. But this is badly written, badly shot and badly acted. It seems like it was given a high budget initially, scrapped and rewritten. and then given a tenth of the budget and a thousand revisions. You can tell there was some talented artists working on this, right along some godawful artists who shouldn't even have jobs. For instance, the colorist who worked on this needs a raise, and the compositor needs to be fired. There are a lot of really cool gritty shots, where you can see all the detail in these worn, wrinkly faces and the detail in the brick and its almost tone mapped, and then you have these terrible green screen jobs that look like they were done in the 40s or something and not in a good way. the whole color isolation thing they borrowed from the first one was at best distracting and at worst downright confusing. there was these scene where they had twins, one was vibrant and yellow and one was straight black and white. no reason, no point, and she didn't really even do much. the lips, the eyes, the whole effect is done without the slightest bit of subtlety or thought, clearly on a whim. And there's some cool comic book style effects, thrown in with some winceably bad parts that bring the cheese factor up to 11.And don't even get me started on the story. There's a mixmatch of 3 different plot lines linked over by only a single character, there's 3 different protagonists and 4 different narrators and weird fantasy sequences that are then referenced as actual events that happened, but THE DUDE CAME OUT OF THE WALL MAN. And then the real version of the dude that wasn't in her head reminded her of the same shît that imaginary him said? And he somehow sees the imaginary version of the main character from the first film? And what did any of that have to do with the crazy manipulative rich chick from act 1? Or was that act 2? act 4? Its more like a bunch of short stories than it is a movie. And with how hard they try to tie them together, its a bit awkward.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For

'EVA GREEN'........Oh Wow! This Dame has curves which just keep giving.She is nothing short of 'SENSATIONAL' and gives one hell of a brave performance (they normally tone-down the nudity for things like this but not here) She is beautiful and like Roark she is sly and manipulative. Fella's your just gonna love her, just not so sure you'd want to make love to her (character) as she'd eat you for breakfast.This is a really well made sequel...better in some regards (styling, Eva, the Team-up) not in others (some stories are weaker) but the STYLING and FEEL of the Film is just as COOL as EVER!There are Plenty of Fantastic Cameo Roles too...Rosario Dawson as Gail is back (and is still a busty beauty)Bruce Willis picks up a nice cheque for a few nice minutes of work.Ray Liotta gets to play with Juno Temple, the lucky fella (if they ever remake that 'BARBARELLA' film one day then it would be a close call between Juno & Alexa Vega for the Title Role)Alexa Vega is here too :-) but blink and you'll miss her (she's one of the dancers)Christopher Lloyd has a fun little role as a Doc tending to Johnny.Jeremy Piven gets on the wrong end of his infatuated cop buddy.Special mention for Dennis Haysbert as Manute who I think did a sterling job of standing in for the sadly departed Michael Clarke Duncan.The only cameo that was disappointing was the super looking Jaime King but at least there were two of her :-)BEST CAMEO? and by far was 'Stacy Keach' damn he looked almost like Jabba the Hut and yet you could tell it was him (even down to the hair lip)It's a niche B-Movie that most will overlook but it's got good wit, style and is NEVER, EVER boring.

164,tmf084,the curse of the sequel ...,8,27 September 2014,"It's very hard to watch and later describe the movie without comparing it to the original Sin City and that's probably the ultimate reason why it tanked critically and commercially. Looking at it as a stand-alone project it's a great movie, visually stunning, a decent story and very much unique. But since there was already a part, it loses the freshness with it's visuals and has to compete on a whole new level and unfortunately it does a few things very wrong. The main things that come to mind are that Josh Brolin isn't as good as Dwight as Clive Owen was and the stories aren't as connected to each other as they should be. Without these stronger intersections the story had no punch and became quickly just a conclusion to the first one. There was no originality in the cut and the structure was almost too conform to a mainstream flick. However, I gave it an 8/10 because it was still entertaining and spectacular if you don't try to measure it too much against its predecessor. Also the performances of Rourke, Green and Alba were enough for me to like it.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
165,Rocketeer_Raccoon,Like a beaten up dead horse...,1,3 July 2015,"This movie is absolutely terrible, the story is a completely broken up mess, the action is boring as hell and some of the original cast from the original Sin City film couldn't make it such as the late Clarke Duncan because they took too long to bring this out like nearly a decade too late, Clarke Duncan is probably thanking Death now for avoiding starring in this big pile of poop of a movie.The movie is full of plot-holes, continuity errors, characters doing stuff that makes no sense, the character of Dwight (Josh Brolin) looks nothing like the actor who played him in the original (Clive Owen) and some of the visual style of the film is bad, like characters who wear glasses in some scenes they look like they are wearing paper glasses over their eyes, it just looks really stupid. I'm not surprised that this movie flopped in cinemas because it really is an awful movie, should have been called ""Sin Sh*tty"". Just avoid this movie everyone...",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
166,nick-sultana,A Dark Yet Visually Stylish Fun Ride For The Fans!,8,21 September 2014,"Sin City was a film that brought not only a visually nor style crime flick but indeed one of the best non-Marvel/DC comic adaptations in film terms. 9 years after being in 'Development Hell', it gets a sequel to further adapt more story-lines and characters. I will admit at first that it's not better or worse than the first movie but it does bring a strong sense of fun, story telling and more 'Tarantino' styled characters. Before its release in Australia recently, I have read reviews that claim that it's not good, poor and yet some where mixed or open-minded. Being a fan of the first one and the graphic novels, I can admit I was not disappointed.The story-lines featured this time are the following (in order);""Just Another Saturday Night"" - Marv wakes up in a middle of a car wreck, with no memory how he got there. He retraces his steps that lead him to a violent pursuit ""The Long Bad Night"" (Part 1) - Johnny arrives in Sin City, looking to win big at the local gambling club. Playing against Senator Roarke and others, Johnny uses his skills to win but comes a price when he crosses the line of who 'wins' first. ""A Dame To Kill For"" - Set years before the events of ""The Big Fat Kill"" in the first film Dwight is fighting for a life of peace and sobriety, but instead is lead into big trouble with his ex-lover Ava who claims that she wants to be free from her abusive husband. ""The Long Bad Night"" (Part 2) - After undergoing the abuse and assault of his winnings, Johnny sets for payback of his own and confronts the demon with a surprising twist.""Nancy's Last Dance"" - Struggling to cope with Hartigan's death after the events of ""That Yellow Bastard"", Nancy is driven to kill Senator Roarke as revenge but must tackle her demons and Hartigan's ghost (who appears to Nancy's mind) who is trying to convince her not to avenge him.Firstly, each of the story lines are great in their own way and the perspective of the protagonist to tells the tale is indeed a strong factor that makes both the comics and first film's narratives seem appropriate. The decision to begin the film with Marv's story was cool, as an audience member I thought it was cool that the action immediately kicks of the film and shows that it won't be a shot-for- shot sequel that clones the first film (not to say that personally in a negative way) but I did like how the mixed narrative structure, black and white tone and the beautifully shot comic book styled panels were all back again as it makes the comics alive on screen.With the characters and development, I can say that it was great and that the casting choices were picked well and they all delivered to their best of their ability. The returning actors and actresses from the first are Mickey Rourke, Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Bruce Willis, Jaime King, and Powers Boothe while newcomers to the film include Josh Brolin (replacing for Clive Owen), Joseph Gordon- Levitt, Eva Green, Dennis Haysbert, Ray Liotta, Christopher Lloyd, Jamie Chung, Jeremy Piven, Christopher Meloni and Juno Temple. I did love Brolin and Green in particular, as Brolin made a decent Dwight giving a gruff yet tough performance of the man who fights for peace and justice for his wrongs (though Clive Owen did give a great version previously as well). While Eva Green is no stranger to play as a blood-thirsty bitch (see 300: Rise of an Empire to prove this) but her as Ava was indeed a sight for eyes to witness and does give a bit of eye candy with her body language.Overall, It's a definite good feeling that the sequel wasn't disappointing at all but it's a bit bad that audiences won't rush to see this because of the 9 year gap it underwent (this caused a bad Box-Office earning for its first week in the US and had people naming it a box office bomb for the year). But take my word, ignore what others say about it as its a decent sequel that needs to be seen. I just hope maybe it will develop a small cult status for those who appreciated it.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
167,criti-cally,Poor Script and Story for a Great Potential Series {criti-cally reviews},6,14 March 2020,"Sin City has always been one of my favourite movies. The first part (in 20050 was absolutely a stunner and had literally blown my mind away with it's storyline, and of course the amazing film-noir-cartoon style visual effects. This was the series, that had me literally searching stores for the Sin City comics, and I even actually own some! This was the first title that let me venture into the world of hardcore Graphic Novels, especially for adults. So of course, when the second part had come out I was ecstatic, but unfortunately, couldn't watch it at the time. I finally got around to seeing it over Netflix. With such a big history around this series for me personally, of course my expectations were very high with this second title.My expectation was not met. The movie didn't quite live up to it's mark for me, and was disappointing to say the least. The visuals and acting was amazing, as always. The same effects as the first part were used, and it was a great re-living of the first movie. So no complaints there!
My problem was with the overall plot and the storyline. As well as the dialogues. Could have been much much better. The first part was very interesting in this field at least.
Like the pervious part, the storyline lis compiled of several plots that are liked to the main plot some way or the other.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
168,rajivness,A let down... :(,6,25 August 2014,"OK, so if you loved the 1st movie - you're expectations are way too high for the sequel.The characters are less interesting and compelling - though Ava's character is truly villainous which I enjoyed greatly - you will too! Her character is a villain you'll love to hate and you'll be rooting for her demise - when you learn why she's a villain to begin with. I'll let you discover that for yourself(hehehe).Another departure from the first movie is the art direction. The first movie gave you a black and white graphic novel type feel - with certain color accented like red and yellow. This movie doesn't stay completely faithful to that format - and allows for characters to be in full color - like a regular movie - which I thought was a bad decision and destroyed the whole gritty graphic novel feel of the movie.Yes, the poster says Bruce Willis - but he's not really in the movie. When you see it, you'll know exactly what I mean. Yes, Mickey Rourke is BadAss as ever - like in the first movie - but they made him a bit of a softie - unlike the first movie - where he's portrayed as this unstoppable maniacal force of pure pain.I didn't understand Joseph Gordon's Character and the reason for his character to be written into the story - a bit of a loose ending. The climax is, well, anti-climactic and very predictable and even clichéd.This movie shows more of Jessica Alba's cabaret talents - so if you get a kick out of that, you may disagree with my low rating.Overall, a - meh - OK movie. Not summer blockbuster at all. I'd rent this movie on DVD - but wouldn't go to the cinema and watch it.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
169,houghtonetet,More of the same,8,14 September 2014,"Nine years after the first Sin City comes this violent sequel that not quite equals the original. The male characters carry on as tough-talking bully-boys and the female characters carry on as kick-ass bitches. There isn't a great deal more to say than that about the three stories that make up this film, really. The stories are well-padded with gratuitous mayhem of all descriptions delivered in stunning 3D. The cinematography and style of the film is the same as before, mostly black and white shot through with splashes of vivid primary colour.Some old characters return - Mickey Rourke was fantastic as Marv and held the whole film together; Jessica Alba tragic again as Nancy; disappointing that Clive Owen was not Dwight, although Josh Brolin was a capable replacement; but Bruce Willis as the ghost of Hartigan seemed a bit pointless. Powers Boothe was excellent as the sadistic Rourke, and there were some nice cameos from Ray Liotta, Lady Gaga, Christopher Lloyd and an unrecognisable Stacy Keach.Eva Green was stunning as Ava Lord and lit up the screen with her style and presence. When her story ended the film faded somewhat, I thought the end of her story should have been left till last.Will there be a second sequel? I hope so, but don't leave the gap so long next time!",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
170,Frogfisher,Good and entertaining... but lacks the novelty of the first.,7,20 August 2014,"A Dame to Kill for is by no means a boring or bad film. It succeeds as a satisfying sequel to the far more novel and perhaps stronger Sin City... it is bloody, violent, beautifully made, with cool deep voices, nudity and clearly fitting into the film noir genre. Where it falls short is in the charactersationssliding a bit, the strength of two original stories, the change in actors and the gap between the first and second film. There is also a desperate need for more iconic moments which the Sin City comics and the film has plenty of, but they never really come in A Dame to Kill for. The characters seems less edgy, less strong charactered and some despite being far more stereotypical carries less of a punch. Especially Marv and Dwight who are the central characters fall a bit short. With Dwight almost feeling detached from the story he is the centre character of. I never thought I would find myself ever thinking that Owen over Brolin. Rourke however seems to have lost some of his edge again, but still causes plenty of mayhem. The new original story lines is probably as good as the rest, but it feels like we never get a very satisfying end out the first one of it especially because it plays as probably the most straightforward story with less of the iconic art work or stunning scenes put in it, it relies on Gordon-Hevitt's abilities more than anything else. The second original story however fairs better mostly due to Alba's dancing and Rourke's brute. If one has not recently seen Sin City and goes to see this it can be a bit hard putting things into place in it's sequel... most people benefit from having seen Sin City recently in order to truly enjoy the film's anachronistic narrative. It is an awesome film, I will not argue against that, and it does give people more of what they want from Sin City. And there is maybe couple of camels to swallow. But I think in time when seen in union with it's predecessor and sequel(s) it will come out stronger than it might appear now.I saw the 3D version and surprisingly it actually works well for the film, although I am sure the film would be just as good in 2D alone. It is worth seeing in the cinema, it has the scale/action/importance and beauty to justify that. It will not be remembered for it's visuals as much as Sin City, but it will be recognised for how it fits into the Sin City style.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
171,ZChrisJ1995,Style over substance,6,19 September 2014,"From a noir perspective, 'Sin City: A Dame to Kill For' is a terrific homage. All of the standard elements, such as the fall guy and femme fatale are present, as well as an absolutely gorgeous visual style, with a strong emphasis on expressionistic shadows and black-and-white photography, as well as odd splashes of bright colors to highlight certain characters and objects. Unfortunately, unlike its predecessor, which can be seen as a perfectly competent standalone noir production, 'A Dame to Kill For' doesn't quite reach the same heights, coming across as a homage piece more than anything. Some of the vignettes, such as Johnny's (Joseph Gordon Levitt)'s storyline, are great, because of their contained, independent nature. Others such as Nancy's (Jessica Alba) feel forced and inconsistent with the tone the film is striving for. Fan-favorites from the first film, such as Marv (Mickey Rourke) and Hartigan (Bruce Willis) also tend to be thrown in as supporting characters based on their popularity, rather than being given their own lengthy story lines. A better approach would have been to create three or four vignettes that are almost unrelated to those of the first film. Whereas the predecessor's screenplay dripped with cynicism and wit, the dialogue in 'A Dame to Kill For' is a bit sloppier, with the odd great noir moment being overwhelmed by some awful one-liners, befitting B-grade action movies more than anything. Despite some of these flaws, 'A Dame to Kill For' still boasts some terrific performances, such as those of Eva Green (not the best femme fatale but still a strong contender), Josh Brolin (taking over from Clive Owen as Dwight), Powers Boothe and Joseph Gordon Levitt. Also, the film's visual style, with the advance in computer-generate imagery over the last nine years, in many ways is an improvement over the original 'Sin City'. Ultimately, if you enjoyed the first film, 'A Dame to Kill For' is a worthwhile watch, despite its flaws in terms of its screenplay, and several of its story lines, which rob it of a bit of its potential majesty.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For

173,theflixerdotcom,Why?,6,2 October 2014,"I had been waiting quite a while for this movie. The first movie was very cutting edge at the time it came out so I was expecting big things from this one. There was a large ensemble cast with many big names, and the potential for something great to happen on screen.Alas, it wasn't meant to be. Sin City A Dame To Kill For was not a bad movie, don't get me wrong...but it seems over time the edginess of the original Sin City has been worn away with so many other properties like Kick Ass for example. Everything was pretty tied up in the first movie so I didn't feel the need to see a sequel.I think my main problem was the villains didn't seems as twisted or as bad as the villains in the first movie. I mean come on -- Elijah Wood and Nick Stahl were both repulsive and as vile as anyone could be. They were disgusting! I just didn't feel that in this movie, I mean Eva Green was fantastic as usual playing an evil woman, BUT isn't this a role we have seen her in before? It didn't have that Sin City weird vibe to it...she was just a bitch.I liked the stories in the film (there are 3), but I'm not sure it was such a good idea to have multiple story lines in a movie that is only 1 hour and ~40 mins long. I wish we could have spent a little more time with each of the characters.Josh Brolin did a good job as new Dwight, but he seemed quite a bit more intense than the Clive Owen Dwight. This made me think about that rather than what was happening a few times.Joseph Gordon-Levitt did a good job as usual; I felt like he got the short straw though as his character felt like he should have a had a little more story to him. The ending was also a little anti-climactic to prove a point that didn't need proving...but that's just my opinion.I felt the Jessica Alba Nancy story was a little weak as well, it all happened way too fast on screen. I'm not sure how long the period was supposed to be in the movie, but it could have been an evening for all I know. It sure felt like it.Powers Booth's Senator was a bit of a let down, he seemed like a tamer version of his son. It truly felt to me like we got the real monster in the last movie and this one was just to tie up some loose ends. The Dame To Kill For storyline was the superior story, and got the title, but the Senator story is the big finale...not sure you could have done it any other way but all that tells me is that this whole thing was probably unnecessary. And that is how I'll leave it, it's not a bad movie but not necessary either -- walk, don't run, to the nearest red box.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
174,film316-125-427677,It's what's Black and white and red ALL over.,4,6 October 2014,"Sin City was a powerhouse of a film, true it drew less flies than all the corpses it created piled up in some kind of wall (possibly to stop the Persians from invading Sparta?) but in the end there is nothing that Hollywood won't make a sequel for and Sin City is one of the few tropes that actually have numerous source materials that are yet to be explored. So I suppose the reel question is will this be more Urban Saints or just a city of sins? Sin City is striking, for all it's short comings (And there are many) it is a movie that demands to be seen, if only for the outstanding visual qualities of the film. Sin City is like an incredible painting on a box of cereal, you look at it in pure wonder at how something so boring can look so impressive, and you enjoy just being in it's company because of what an engaging look the movie has, and yes I am comparing Sin City 2 to art but if we look at the comics the statement becomes true. So how does the film translate? Here's the problem with Sin City 2: A Dame To Kill For, is that it never expected to be a sequel, Sin City was a film apart from the rest it was bloodthirsty and horrible to women and just plain nasty, and it even bombed at the cinema, yet here we stand today with the movie having another 90 minutes to sustain. And here in lies the problem, because Sin City never thought it would have to make another movie, it used all it's very best stories first. By comparison, the tales we have in A Dame To Kill For are either tame or boring. We are presented with 3 tales, which are each given around half an hour (No change from the original there), however none of the stories even come close to anything in Sin City. There is nothing on par with the nastiness or The Yellow Barstard or as shocking as The Long Hard Goodbye, no, A Dame To Kill For has 3 films mostly about vengeance. The highlight of these 3 fables is The Long Bad Night (Which was written originally for the film), but more on that later.Sin City has always had some simple problems, it's treatment of women being prime. The word ""objectified"" is perfect for A Dame To Kill For, because every single women (And I do mean EVERY SINGLE WOMEN) is a whore in Sin City, there are no above it, they are all the lowest of the low, I mean in fairness the men are not far above them, but still!. At least in A Dame To Kill For they try and empower women a little bit, with Ava being a man eater and a manipulator of the lesser sexes. But all of this justification feels flimsy when Eva Green spends most of her screen time completely naked. I can't justify something like that, it's just not going to happen.A Dame To Kill For is still the same visual frenzy as the first movie, with the now iconic black and white with splashes of colour used to enhance our experience of the world. That's why you watch Sin City to have something incredible to view, not engaging nor clever, just incredible.The cast are all B lister's with a handful of highlights making cameo appearances, Bruce Willis and Ray Liotta being top of this. Most of the cast are in truth average, however the majestic grace that Joseph Gordon-Levitt commands while on screen is really quite something.A Dame To Kill For is a movie that's all about the coating, don't look at the picture it's painting, don't even look at the artists or to find some deep meaning in it all, just sit down, switch off and enjoy. Nothing wrong with that, when done right. For all it's short comings A Dame To Kill For is still it's own movie which refuses to bow down to the needs or whims of any Hollywood company, I respect it for that.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For

The 300 was a waste (in more ways than one ), but the cinematic style of this movie took great advantage of the effect. I see by the other reviews that the plot and characters aren't as good as the first, but if you don't know this, they are intriguing enough. The violence is mostly cartoonish, shading off into, I assume, intentionally funny.The three stories are all pretty clear conflicts of good versus evil, making the more over the top violence palatable. In fact, the plots are kinda sunny for noir. It takes a little while to figure out what's going on, but once you do, the plot is more amusing than tense. The movie could be called ""A Good Dame is Hard to Find"" and it keeps the theme going to the end...Well,now I have seen the first movie, and this is way better. The first one is a visual aid for people who like the comic.

176,JackRice100,Good but didn't live up to the first.,7,3 November 2014,"Sin City: A Dame to Kill For is a good film, but because its a sequel to such a great film like Sin City it just makes you feel disappointed and rather gutted that it wasn't better than it was. I did like this film it just didn't live up to the first and after waiting 9 years for the sequel I'm hardly surprised. The things I really liked were Marv being as bad ass as ever, Nancy who is showing the after effects of what happened at the end of the first film, the new guy Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who plays a really cool guy who just has all the luck in the world who wins big at a game of poker with the wrong people. Then there's Josh Brolin as Dwight a guy who seems relatively normal to Sin City's crazy inhabitants but seems to have a rather shady past. I loved the way it looked that was all really good as you'd expect. Sadly I didn't feel like I was in the pages of the graphic novel like before ether, I think this is due to the stories not being at all as gripping, as the first film. The stories/segments in this film I just couldn't get on with annoyingly. I did care for the characters but no were near as much as I should of and I did for the first few in Sin City. Acting wise this film didn't disappoint for me, Powers Boothe played Senator Roark fanatically, Mickey Rourke as Marv was one of the biggest highlights for me he was great to see back and so was Nancy (Jessica Alba) who's character for me had really good character growth and to see that in this film was really good. The small part Bruce Willis played as Hartigan was nice as well. What I really loved about the first film was its originality and some of this they kept like the actual style of the film and cinematography but they didn't keep the shocking story lines (11 year old could be raped and the others) which had me hooked for the most part in the first one, the credits after each segment was a little and quite strange thing at first but it made me love it even more as I hadn't seen something like that before Sin City which made it that bit more original and interesting to watch.

I, like a lot of people, am a fan of the original, however it was known quite quickly after it's release and success that there was going to be a sequel. Now for it to take Nine Years to produce and release a sequel, you would think that there was either creative issues or casting issues, and after watching this it's obvious they had both. This ""film"" contains some of the worst dialogue I have ever heard, below the standard of a romance novel which a grandmother would purchase. There are action sequences which contain more exposition than most movies, and I understand that this is somewhat of a style, but it's not a very good one for film. There are scenes which visually look appealing, nothing spectacular by any means, this movie was awful, and made me want to watch a Michael Bay film to counter the extra expositional moments that come one after another, like endings during the last 45 minutes of ""Return of the King"". There are going to be people who love it, most likely purely for the names attached, but this film was truly horrible.

If you want to see unrelenting brutality & most of Eva Green you will get your money's worth & then some. Green totally owns the ""Dame"" role that she was perfectly cast for. When her story ends the movie does drop off (fortunately her story is most of the movie).The ""Sin City look"" is enhanced by 3D (I normally avoid 3D) & rates as one of the best uses of 3D I've ever seen. Fans (like me) of Miller's ""A Dame To Kill For"" comic book will be thrilled at it's obsessive loyalty to word & frame screen treatment. It looks fantastic! (Maybe, I mean to say that Green looks fantastic. It's both.) I don't get all the criticism of how this ""look"" has grown tiresome --not for me in 3D.All the actors in big roles to small look like they are having a sinful amount of fun, but Joseph Gordon-Levitt is almost as strong as Green in a new role in one the new stories written for the movie. If you saw ""Looper"" (or ""Inception"") you already know that JGL can play a tough guy despite his physical size.Make no mistake this movie is a feature length Roadrunner cartoon for adults --emphasis on ""adults""--with all of the ridiculous action & over- the-top violence that only a cartoon can get away with because of the way it's rendered.(No kids, please: there is just enough gore that isn't so cartoonish to make it unfit for children.)Like the first Sin City 9 years ago, this new Sin City is B-movie bliss.

179,benoit_03,"Not everyone's cup of tea, but a dark, gritty and captivating noir thriller.",7,31 August 2014,"Like it's 2005 predecessor, Sin City: A Dame to Kill For is an acquired taste in cinema. Based on Frank Miller's graphic novels of the same name it appeals mainly to those that are fond of the gritty, blood-drenched crime genre, with it's adult themes and noir setting.The story is split into four 'mini-plots', three being sequels to the first film and one being a prequel of sorts, which all revolve around the citizens of Basin City. Each of the plots are well written, and each are acted brilliantly by the all-star cast. Eva Green does completely steal the show as the 'Dame to Kill For', with a standout performance among the others.The black and white visual style used here, which won the first film the Technical Grand Prize at 2005's Cannes Film Festival, is captivating and really draws your attention to key figures with contrasts such as the Dame's bright blue dress and deep red lipstick, as well as the odd 3D squirt of blood.Not every film is perfect though and the fall from grace that this film experiences, as did the previous movie, is the general derogatory view on women that it portrays. The majority of female characters are either strippers, prostitutes, or crime-committing gang members, with the exception of Green's lead. There is no 'heroine', so to speak, so be prepared for a testosterone-infused hero fest.Overall, we've been provided with a sequel that doesn't necessarily improve on the original, but supplies plenty of the same style that was so great about the first film, and keep you entertained over the hour and forty that you are in there.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
180,skradji,"Good sequel, whatever they say.",7,5 October 2014,"Sin City was a real bombshell and the most masterful demonstration of how you have to adapt a Comic or Graphic Novel. The film was almost perfect, dignified atmosphere and aesthetics of the best Black Cinema, Tarantino own narrative scheme, fascinating characters with intelligent conversations, spectacular action sequences ..... do not know if I exaggerate, but I consider it a masterpiece and Film a real achievement. Here then, the second part, and I think something has seriously failed. In itself, it is not a bad movie, but from that starts with the story of Joseph Levitt, that I found the best and most interesting, and Levitt is immense and demonstrating a talent that does nothing but hold, the story loses some gas as you go. But somehow the story begins Josh Brolin something begins to twist and starts to lose the smooth running of the principle. Still Sin City, OK, but for some reason the intensity and the overwhelming power of the stories and scenes from the earlier film are reduced by half in this. They produce so many emotions but in some sections is a bit heavy, not boring, but the pace that kills and weakens the tension and pace. And on top of the action scenes are pretty weak, for example the confrontation between Marv and the giant black bodyguard, I expected a bestial body body, but everything stays in a couple of pushes, two or three strokes, and ripping off Marv eye like a plastic Barbie. This was the huge gorilla was not human? That joke is that? Of all the characters in this new sequel, I have just said Levitt interesting result, the colossal Marv and Eva Green. Josh Brolin has turned me loose, Ray Liotta barely see him, Bruce Willis is a pair of Flashbacks and others are not much to write, no time. This time the film is too short and there is scope to develop the other characters, there are some back, but do not say much, or tell stories with a little more force than offered here In short, this sequel is good, it is good, but does not even remotely the HEIGHT of the first, and that is something very serious. If not equal or exceed the above, it makes sense to make a third? Highlight scene Levitt being treated by a doctor means crazy embodied by the legendary Christopher Lloyd.

181,Travixius,One casting mistake away from greatness......,8,14 October 2014,"I have to write this review as both a fan of the first Sin City film and a reader of every volume of the graphic novels. By far the best of the stories penned and drawn by Frank Miller is A Dame to Kill For. This movie plays just like a bunch of deleted scenes from Sin City 1, which in this case is a good thing. Micky Roarke is back as Marv as well as appearances by Bruce Willis, Jessica Alba and Rosario Dawson reprising their roles. Josh Brolin now takes up the pre-plastic surgery role that Clive Owen had in SC1 as Dwight McCarthy and is great in the role. The framework of the movie is set for success from the start but then..... Several years ago after the first film, an announcement was made that ""dame"" would be the next movie. In the ensuing years a handful of names were rumoured for the role of Ava Lord, the titular ""dame"". Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayak. We eventually heard the role had gone to Eva Green and frankly it was an ""of course it should be"" moment. Green is the contemporary actor to go to for ""unhinged"" in recent years and I thought it was a masterful casting decision. I was wrong. Ava Lord in the novel is the ultimate femme fatale, cold, calculating, Machiavellian and frankly, chilling. From the moment we see Ava in this film, it just doesn't work. Green simply spins the wheels and gives us the same character she plays in Penny Dreadful and 300 Rise of an Empire. The Ava from Miller's pages weaves a spell on men with faux sincerity and vulnerability. Eva Green is not believable as this character. If you were an intended victim of AVA you would fall, hook, line, sinker and bait. EVA is a big stinking, leg of ham that screams E Coli from a mile. It gets worse because it appears E.G. cannot nail an American accent and sounds periodically Trans-Atlantic. Also why did Miller not go with Ava's signature curl-bob haircut from the comic? (Eva Green even has it in the poster?!?!) But the worst Sin in this City is that (I am gonna get hate for this) she is just not ""sexy"". No I don't mean she doesn't have a great body and look amazing. She just doesn't convey the timeless allure of Ava Lord who is essentially a brunette Marilyn Monroe. In fact she is eclipsed in the sensual department by other players in the movie, especially Rosario Dawson. Perhaps the level of nudity required for the role was an issue given that Green has a card blanche policy on shedding cloth, but unfortunately what should have been this film's greatest strength is instead it's most fundamental weakness. The law of diminishing returns has fallen on this city. Choose the pages of it's source for any future trips to the Sin bin.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For

Decapitations. Self-mutilation.Come on now people... What is there not to like!!?? No But seriously I think this was a pretty good Sequel. I gave 8.5 to the first one and I gave 8 to this one. Bruce Willis could've been left apart from the movie but all in all it was fun. Once again don't listen to the haters. Get this movie watch it and get off. Just like I got off of it. Now I don't have much else to say so good night everybody take care yourselves.,Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
183,simon-wang,"Live free, die hard",10,19 September 2014,"""Sin City: A Dame to Kill for"" is everything the moviegoer with taste, dreamed for, and far more. I appreciated the perfect visuals of the first movie, however it was too ... dark. I don't like to watch movies, just to be told, that the world is a dark place, where you will be born, and eventually die.This time, though equally dark, and stylish, I really felt, the movie had something to say, that could move me. The movie's message is more: ""The world is dark a place, where you will be born, and die, and if you struggle, keep struggling, maybe you will leave the world less dark, than it was before.So obviously, like part 1, (it feels like a part 2), it is not a feel-good-movie, some critics wrote about the first part, it is like a kick in the balls. The same is true for ""A Dame to Kill for"", maybe even more. However it is drop-dead-cool, and you will get something back in reward. It is no fun, no entertainment, no celebration of special-effects, it is like a hit in the face, it tells you that good people won't always have a happy ending, but that shouldn't keep you from being it.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
184,calle_2565,"Gritty, Great But Could've Been More",7,12 September 2014,"Having seen the reviews of this title before watching the movie I can understand some of the criticism. In my humble opinion I think that it depends on the stories depicted in the movie. Being a fan of the graphic novels I'd say that ""That Yellow Bastard"", ""The Big Fat Kill"", ""The Hard Goodbye"" and the tie in with ""The Customer Is Always Right"" is hard to top, given that they are all ends to the story (In a sense). Which means that they pack a lot of action in. Making it more interesting, and I agree. I like the first movie a lot better, but I like this movie as well.First off I really don't think that the casting for Ava could've been any better. Eva Green just seem like the typical temptress, and she pulls through without breaking a sweat. And I guess Josh Brolin is OK as Dwight, but come on, he's no Clive Owen. I felt that the hunger for revenge and stone cold intensity that Dwight has in the comic is better portrayed by Owen. Just one guy's opinion though. Other than that ""A Dame To Kill For"" is beautifully portrayed onto the screen.And ""Just Another Saturday Night"" is roughly 3-5 minutes of the movie. It is a short story but I don't know, I always liked this story for the fact that you get to know Marv a bit more and his pending problems without him having to take down a branch of the Roarks. They could've focused a bit more on this story.The new stories exclusive to the film are actually quite good, but with the subject in hand with one of the stories you could've branched it out even further and possibly made a whole movie around it. I'm talking about ""Nancy's Last Dance"" of course. Sure it has some bad writing, not up to par with other Sin City stories, but give it some time and thought and you have Nancy going after the man that drove the only man she loved to kill himself to save her. I mean that in itself is a cause to branch out the story. Though it is short and rushed with some of the writing it is a very interesting story in my eyes. And ""The Long Bad Night"" oh how close can you come to a ""real"" Sin City story? Well this one hits pretty f-ing close. Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a dismissed Roark gambler trying to make it big. Playing high stakes poker with his father, the one and only Senator Roark. Eventually after being beaten, having his lucky charm murdered and being operated by doc brown, or as he is called in this movie Kroenig (Christopher Lloyd) after winning against the Senator. And the pay-off in the end is just beautiful. Becoming a martyr over the second card game, going down in the history books as the man that beat the Senator twice. Superb.Overall I understand that this isn't a film for anyone. Liking Sin City is a plus, as is liking Rodriguez as a film maker. But the stories depicted is great, some better than others but it is a movie worth seeing. If not for the stories the visuals are just as impressive as the first movie.Enjoy!",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
185,snafux7,Hollywood Money Grab,4,6 December 2015,"Hollywood's dirty little fingerprints are all over this sad sequel. Everything that made the first movie interesting and unique and compelling was painfully recycled in the sequel. The first half hour was pretty good actually, it seemed to pick up where the first one left off, different story, different characters but with the same noire backdrop and narrative. If I had to guess, the people who started off with this flick wanted to make a great follow up to the original but got screwed over by the studio suits seeking to remake the same movie while 'amping it up' in the process. Virtually all the same characters from the original make at least a cameo in the 2nd one...Why? I still can't figure that out because they contribute absolutely nothing to the story in the slightest. I think the suits decided that the average idiot movie goer likes to see characters that they remember and that's all there was to it. The worst part? It seems that Jessica Alba's agent demanded that she get at least 5 'stripper' scenes in the film so she could show off her assets. That alone wouldn't be the worst thing ever but they also had to give her actual lines and lets face it, she's probably the worst actress in existence today so watching her try to act is excruciating. But even if she was just gyrating on stage it would still have tainted the story because it was just way too much and served zero purpose other than to showcase her. The one high point of the film was that Eva Green wears little to nothing most of her time on screen which is delightful. Sadly it's not enough to save a crap movie. I was so disappointed by this abortion of a film, I was just hoping for a decent sequel, nothing amazing...and it disappointed virtually every step of the way.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For

A lot.,2,1 October 2014,"Gosh, this film was SO stupid...I know this is a fantasy world with fantasy rules but seriously, how many goddamn bullets to the head, ripped out eyes or other deadly flesh wounds does it take for ANYONE to die in Sin City? It became ridiculous at some point how apparently everyone is a Wolverine in disguise. It made all the action and shootout scenes laughable and lame to watch.Not even the sometimes really impressive CGI or Eva Green could rescue this hot mess with its nonsense voice overs and predictable story line. The action scenes were lame, the characters were boring and it did in no way get even close to the cool, fresh vibe the first Sin City delivered a couple of years ago.2/10, one of the most disappointing movies in a long time.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
187,citizen-caveman,"If you liked the original, you like this. Comic book film-noir, more style than story",8,26 August 2014,"This has all the tropes typical of film-noir: it's fatalistic, it has suckers meet femme-fatale, murky shadows and harsh lights. What distinguishes the original Sin City from the classical noir of 1940-59 is the explicit violence (though not enough to be shocking) and the male- adolescent, perhaps puerile, manner which portrays women as dominatrices (tight leather, handcuffs, etc.). My favourite bit of course.Sin City: A Dame to Kill for sticks with this winning formula (wins for me at least). And Jessica Alba as an exotic dancer too. (That part works best of all for me!)The various story-threads are strong enough but not so original. What really sells the film is the delivery, its polish. Even though the film never takes itself too seriously, it remains emotionally engaging, you care about the characters. Not a life-changing film but solid entertainment nevertheless.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
188,tlettl83,Curb your taste for sinful art.,7,30 August 2014,"Sin city is in short a masterpiece. A movie of its own that stands out. The sequel is not equally good, but it is a good sequel nonetheless. Questions unanswered from the first movie gets resolved and answered. It follows the same concept of short movies interacting with each other on a larger scale.Of course alternations was made due to the 9 years apart of production. This affects the movie experience for the worse. Mickey Rourke isn't as ripped as in the first, its noticeable even though they try to cover it up. Alba is older, death of 2 actors that led to writing of a character and recast another.As of recasting Dwight, I do welcome it, because I personally don't like Cliwe Owens acting in general. Josh Brolin really made the character of Dwight work for me and it was a joy seeing him portrayed in Art Noir form.However, the best part of this movie spoke to my primate brain. Tits and ass. Art class porn. Amazing shots of boobs, boobs, and more boobs. Silhouettes of beautiful women bodies, in a mix of violence and gore in black and white, in the form of desperate characters in Sin city, made me love every minute watching the movie. In this, the sequel triumphs over the first. However, the pace, character development and story lines still holds true to the original.I say go watch the movie, its not a bad one. Its almost 2 hours getting lost into the city of sin again.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
189,steveneven,Sin City: Not a Dame to Kill For,5,23 August 2014,"I will save you the critical hubbub of the first ""Sin City"". This review is for ""Sin City: A Dame to Kill For""- not for both films. With that being said, ""A Dame to Kill For"" is just not a good film on its own merit. Does that mean you should skip a 3D matinée of it? No. The world of ""Sin City"" is so fascinating in its comic book-esque and film noir-like presence, I would tell you to see this film for that reason alone. I mean sure, Eva Green naked and Joseph Gordon Levitt's performance are some highlights (which EVERY review has pointed out), yet they are not enough to carry Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller's production. What carries the production are its performances. Everyone wants to know if the original cast stacks up, and how the fresh faces play out. Let us start with Eva Green since this movie revolves around her. She was fine as this sensual manipulator, who uses sex to kill her men. I mean her assets are really what elevated her performance. I am no sexist. I am just saying that her character was serviceable. She just did not have much to work with, so I really do not blame her. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, on the other hand (no pun intended) was actually pretty good as the cocky gambler.. I actually thought he made most of his role. Now, Jessica Alba puzzles me. Not so much for her acting (which like most of the people here, did a fine job), but for her choice in performance. Whereas her character is nude in the comics (you know where this is going), in the film, Alba is stripping like Rodriguez changed his mind about ""Sin City"" being R in pre-production. Ye, you have Green flashing her breasts like they are dollar bills (albeit being unnecessary) But don't worry my non-biased film readers, I am not judging Alba based on her acting here. That aside, her deranged and revenge-seeking character is great. It certainly makes Alba interesting and gives her something to work with.As for everyone else, Mickey Rourke, of course, steals every scene he is in. On a side note, can people stop talking about Rourke's plastic surgery. Rourke is incredible- plastic or no plastic. Now back to the characters, there were complaints about Lady Gaga. Yet, Gaga was pretty good in the few minutes she acted. I think people like to hate on singers becoming actresses but she is one artist I do not mind seeing in film.I thought she was decent in ""Machete Kills"" and she is decent in here as well.Now, about that script. Yes I am going to sound like the New York Times, or any other magazine that talked about this issue, but the dialogue here is not good. I do not care if it came from the comics, it either sounds awkward or melodramatic in context. The lines are not that inappropriate in the sense that it takes you out of the film, but you could really tell the dialogue was secondary to the cinematography. As for the direction of the film, it felt very paint-by-numbers. It was like watching any Sunday night drama from the 40's, with nothing really that ""Sin City"" about it. Yes you have the strippers, the ferocious male figures, the black and white color scheme, etc. Yet, the way it was paced felt like any other film.This all sounds very formulaic, so where does the ""5"" come in? The visuals. I know that is already the standard for ""Sin City"", as it should be, but this film really looks fantastic. If you were worried that the promos for this movie looked cheap, the film looks way better on screen. The fake precipitation, the neon lights, the outfits on the girls- they all look dazzling. And if you just came into ""A Dame to Kill for"" for the gratuitous sex, nudity, and violence, you came to the right place. I will say this though- the sex is not very sexy. Well, I did it. I did not talk about Rodriguez' previous films, and I did not talk about the first ""Sin City"". When I review movies I judge them solely on their own. And, for those saying that a critic is too ""critical"" of a movie like ""Sin City"", remember, you guys were the ones defending ""Sin City"" and saying that the film was great despite the aesthetics. And two, if you have not seen the film, you cannot judge someone's favorable/unfavorable opinions on it. So was ""A Dame to Kill For"" worth the nine year wait? No, but it is an interesting film. For every good, there is bad. And for every decapitated head, there is some dull off-screen death. However, if you see ""Sin City"", do it in 3-D. There are not that many ""pop-up"" moments, but when there are the 3-D is dazzling.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
190,skippytjd,"Not as groundbreaking as the original, but still solid",8,10 February 2019,"Taking nine years to follow up the groundbreaking original proved to be a death knell at the box office, which is truly a shame because this film deserved so much more attention than it garnered. Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller return to bring to life the immensely popular title story, as well as ""Just Another Saturday Night"" as well as introducing two brand new tales.The film was criticized for lacking the freshness of the first movie, but to claim that is to ignore the new stylistic tricks and how the directors play with audience expectations within the context of the signature style of both the book and film. Eva Green owns the screen whenever she appears, which is testament to her perfect performance in the title role, as every actor, both new and returning, commit totally to their parts. With one big story and three more personal tales, the bigness of the original may understandably be absent, but the strength of the stories, the strength of the acting, the strength of the direction is in no way minimized by the scale.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
191,rapidcereb,A Worthy Sequel,7,28 September 2014,"Reading all of the negative reviews, and having watched the mediocre trailer, I was expecting a major let down, in fact I was already feeling let down. Instead, this movie delivered! I could watch this style of on screen story telling and action for ten hours straight; love the film noire aspects mixed with the modern gritty flavour.Not as fulfilling as the first Sin City, but was shot in very much the same flawless style. Just missing some of the stranger supernatural aspects of the first movie such as the soul eating kid Kevin, and it was not quite as 'dark' as the first. They added some new story elements to the movie not from the original material, and it was pretty good, and while the mini story didn't end that strongly, it added good filler and style to the movie, along with something to ponder.Certainly not as ""meaty"" as the first, but for the first twenty minutes I had a semi nostalgic grin on my face, as it brought back memories of how great the first Sin City was and how much I love this sort of movie style. They should seriously make a few more in this vein of slightly 'B' 'movieness', and together, they will be able to make up for the lost time waiting for a nine year held up sequel.Should they have made this movie after that much time passing? Yes, but they should strongly consider make one or two more equally as good as this one.Don't listen to all the negative reviews, if you liked the first one, give ""Sin City: A Dame to Kill For"" a watch and some support, and hopefully we can get some more!",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For

However, that was not the case at least for me. It has the same nice atmosphere and effects as the first one and new interesting and unpredictable stories. Sure it is not as original as the first one (that would be an extremely difficult task to begin with) and maybe that is the only reason I put an 8 instead of a 9. However, if you enjoyed the first one you probably will enjoy this one as well. The new additions to the cast manage to fill the gaps of their predecessors quite well. I would advise anyone who wishes to watch this movie not to get overly influenced by ratings or how good was the first one and enjoy this sequel for what it is. A nice addition to the first one, like an extension of the concept. I would gladly watch and wait for sin city 3 if it is like this one. Cheers.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
195,masonj-1,Eva Green deserves an Academy Award Nomination for her performance,8,17 September 2014,My comments are limited to Eva Green's performance.Eva Green is Brilliant. Her performance alone is more than enough reason to see this movie. Her performance is absolutely classic and well worth the price of admission. Imagine all The greatest femme fatale performances in classic film noir -- and add this at or near the top of that list. Yes this movie has more edge than might have been imagined in the classic noir era. Yes the film is raw in a way such that that raw quality may be the dominant impression that some viewers are left with. It would be truly tragic if these characteristics caused Eva's performance to be overlooked. She is exuberant and soaring. She delivers as brilliant an acting performance as anyone has brought to the screen in years. Think of it as a femme fatale incarnation of the intensity displayed in Dinero's 'Raging Bull' performance. It is a take no prisoners femme fatal performed to perfection Eva Green deserves an Academy Award Nomination for her performance. If would be ashamed if the films box office performance results in her not receiving the recognition that her performance deserves.She is the masterpiece within this movie!,Sin City - A Dame to Kill For

Mickey Rourke is excellent as Marv yet again.Sadly, that is about all the good I can say. Joseph Gordon-Levitt was very weak & his character almost pointless, beyond being time filler.

197,pongigmon,A satisfying sequel for Sin City fans,7,26 August 2014,"The first Sin City that came out 9 years ago was impeccable, the ingenious shooting in monochrome, to amplify the atrocity, crimes within the rotten town. The violence, nudity, blood spilled experience was stylistically done. It was undoubtedly exceptional piece that stood out and becomes a paradigm of filming noir piece from comic material. Same with the first one, Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez took the director seat, Rodriguez was known for his ruthless shooting style in films such as Machete and Planet Terror. The film is long anticipated and bound to become promising after the triumph of the last one.Marv played by Mark Rourke is still as entertaining as he was left off in the first one, play as a tough guy in Basin City, the man who had born in the wrong era, the hyper-masculine character who was literally invulnerable to death. As anyone would have expected, Marv has delivered some outlandishly battering and ravenous for blood and gory. The fighting scenes was gratifying in this sequel, the clever switch of stark black and white to emphasize the contrast, the exaggerating thumping was magnificent.Ava Lord (played by Eva Green) is one of the centric characters revolved in the story, bewitched by her dazzling green eye and seductive tone. Without question, Eva Green is the perfect candidate to be the dame and goddess that make man living in ecstasy and torn to pieces at the same time. Her slick, beguiling nature was explicitly shown with the excessive nudity, it is clear that Ava use her body as a deadly weapon to manipulate men to be head over heel for her.Senator Roark is a strong vantage point of the film, despite that he took a minor role in the previous one. He is ferocious, powerful and it is interesting to watch the antagonistic villain's relationship with the main characters Johny (played by Joseph Gordon Levitt) and Nancy (played by Jessica Alba).Personally, I preferred the Dwight in the last one, played by Clive Owen, Josh Brolin is less edgy Dwight which was fairly disappointing. I had the feeling that he wasn't really involved in the story and lack of character and psyche as Clive Owen did. Deadly Miho also played a minor role in this one, Devon Aoki was the wild card for me in the first movie. She had the grotesque look and speechless, brutal killing is much need in Sin City which is another let down for me.Overall, the sequel is satisfying though it might have fall short given the standard set in Sin City. Yet, the shooting style and the general features of the film is still nicely put together and consistent with the first film. So, it's worthy to watch it if you like the first one.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For

It was not even so bad it was good nor will it get a cult following. I've seen better video's that kids put on youtube of their game they played. This was nothing but a paycheck for the actors I suspect or they are very disappointed if they went out on the limb to make a interesting form of genera. I am not sure what they were really trying to do but I recall making stick figures move by drawing them on different pages in school and that was more interesting than this disaster.I have a open mind with diverse interest and also allow lots of lead-way for directors artistic interpretations and interest in varied genres. This film is nothing but a way to sell, market, or increase sales of a video game or something else I am pretty sure and suspect.I have never given such a low rating and hope not to again. It was sad such potential was so wasted and made into such pathetic material. Kind of a mixture of the late 1800's movies, original 1960's Batman with Laurel and Hardy with only their worst parts and aspects of those old shows of which they mixed together made into such pure tripe as this movie. In fact the old shows are way better than this mess of a movie.Save your money and do not be mislead by high ratings for they are not accurate and something is not right with such a high rating for this trash. Likely corporate paid voters or people who feel peer pressured by slick marketing to make more of this nothing movie than it is. Since they put such money into this waste of time I am sure they are desperate to do anything to save their backsides and to continue the complex unseen agenda the studio apparently has going.No way something this bad gets to the big screen without lots of desperation and a bigger agenda influencing it with financial desperation as a underlying aspect on how it got on screen. Do not be suckered into the marketing of this sad trash with such wasted talent! So sad!

202,shotglassanhero,"""Gone to that place where there's no pain or thought""",4,13 September 2016,"I could tell there was something wrong with this film just by the way it started. There is this sense in the air. A muddled script, nonsensical plot, confusing timelines...Mickey Rourke looks so old in this film. I think one of the issues with making a sequel like this is that it took too long to be produced. Between the 8 years the former actor playing Minute died of a heart of attack in 2012, Clive Owen probably read the script for the character Dwight and presumably didn't want to reprise the role (which I don't blame him), and Bruce Willis shows up to play a ghost probably for a sweet paycheck. Jordan Gordon Levitt is also mistaking cast into this film who does a poor job trying to act. I'm not even sure I can talk about the story because it's very incoherent. Mostly because if you haven't seen (or read) any of the chapters in the previous film recently, you are constantly trying to piece together how it all fits in. The shock and awe that comes from the gory film noir and classic black and white canvas style shots are still here with a stunning return; but the violence is mindlessly carried out to excess without purpose. Some of the best kinds of tricks it can pull are pulled and run into the ground--into futility. Such as the touches of coloring. Look, coloring is a powerful tool in film--and Sin City is all about how tints, shadows, and light affect the picture. When they added touches of color it really sent a vibe to pay attention to that particular object. But in the very first 20 minutes an ongodly amount of light and color is shoved onto the portion of the screen that is the empty space and not the center of attention. It doesn't make sense thematically. Moreover, sometimes the color would annoyingly disappear and reappear in the same shot. Also, voice over is overused. There's no cadence to the words spoken anymore--it chokes up your ears and incessantly tells you what's happening rather than what the characters are feeling. Granted it sometimes does both now--but it's a crutch that doesn't need to be too gratuitous all the time, every time. I'm not making this review to just talk about color and voice-overs--I'm just trying to make a point. The film-makers responsible here wanted to shove something out there that obviously was not meant to be. And you feel with a project like this they decided to put any type of creative spin to make it work. The re-casting of the former's roles do not hold up. The story is not as poignant or interesting as they were in the last film. And I feel as if they had just tried harder to make this sequel sooner rather than later--perhaps it would be a different story. Then again sequels like this are mostly a cash grab but you get a sense that the filmmakers who let the former success go to their heads. Yeah, they want to make something good--but it's likely they wanted to make a sequel just because they like writing and directing movies like this. So when 'The Spirit' flopped and enough years passed, I'm guessing the studio green-lit this project which probably was in development as soon as Frank Miller saw more dollar signs in his future. Unfortunately our ride is probably finished with this franchise. I'm assuming it didn't make enough money back to justify any more of it. And with the forever aging, dying, and or negligent cast, along with poor critical and film audience acclaim, I'd bet I'm right. And you don't even need to blow on my coin for good luck.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
203,nathanpollard-34-591307,Sin Sh@$%y.,1,12 February 2015,"The original Sin City was a ballsy, exciting, macho, stunning piece of work and the prospect of more of the same sounded, in theory, very appealing. But nearly ten years have passed since the original, so why are the makers returning to give us another installment of the neo- noir comic adaptation? Well the past few years have not been kind to either directors; Rodriguez seems content to spew out more of the same kid flicks and low quality b-movies homages and Miller continues to move further to the right with his controversial (also read racist) comic book, The Holy Terror. Oh and let's not forget The Spirit, though I have tried to erase this sorry excuse for a film from my memory bank many times. But come on, surely getting the team back together, with most of the original cast who have not yet died, and an assortment of new big names; Joseph Gordon-Levitt(Oh I loved Third Rock From The Sun), Eva Green (classy), Josh Brolin (hmm pushing it already), Lady Gaga (really?) and er, Mr Selfridge himself Jeremy Piven, should equal brilliance? Or a film that is not quite as good as the first but alright? Or something merely mediocre? No.It is far worse than that.The big difference between the two installments seems to be that second time around they forgot what a plot is/was/should be. So we are left we three, or at least I feel there was an attempt at three, rather under cooked ""stories"" to the point that they are not only raw but they are walking on all fours and trying to escape from the horror of being savagely placed in this stinker of a film. But Sin City was not really about a great plot was it? It was the superb visuals? This time round the visuals look more primitive than in the original and give the film a sense of a straight-to-video knock off sequel a' la the pointless S. Darko or unessential American Psycho 2. And as for the sexism, well the original did a great job at showcasing the wide world of women's achievement; strippers and hookers. Now you can through in mostly exposed gold digger in the form of Eva Green, who maybe as they had run out of money, is mostly naked due to cut backs to the wardrobe department.Throw all these inadequacies together and for 102 minutes of your life you have a super sized plateful of disappointment. In ten years time, I will be avoiding Sin City 3: A Film To Bore You To Death like whatever deadly disease is ravaging the world at that time.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
204,dashoost,Sin Sh*tty: A Movie to Avoid,1,24 August 2014,"This sequel is simply a Bizzaro version of the original, and what I mean by that is that every scene from the first film was like a positive exposure of a black and white photograph, while every scene here is the exact negative exposure of that same black and white photo. Every memory I have of the original film has a direct correlation to something seen here in the sequel, with the exception of a real opening or closing scene. That important piece (Josh Hartnett's cameo) was clearly missing here because it was a clever way to needle a thread through the tales about to be told and leads to an ending scene which cleverly sums up what we saw throughout the film starting with that first scene. The fact that this movie just opens up with a very flimsy and rehashed amnesia scene similar to the tale of Marv from the first movie (minus the hot blonde girl) is a sign that we are in for something similar yet different this time? Please allow me to explain. Marv now finds himself with another case of amnesia...another short confusing tale begins, which is severely lacking the quick, witty dialogue, that allowed Rourke to steal the show in the original. We watch him retrace his steps and it all leads back to him murdering 4 very wimpy men who apparently have never been in a fight before. Considering there isn't anything seen here that wasn't already encountered in the original, this opening sequence only succeeds in extracting all of the charisma and mystique created for Marv throughout the original. Next, we are introduced to a new character, Johnny, played by Joe Gordon-Levitt. Initially, he seems to fit in this world, he's got some charm and cleverness about him and there is a slight hope of originality displayed in this story, involving a poker game with the senator character introduced in the first film, essentially giving off the same kind of good vs evil vibe here, just as in the original. We are left with Johnny facing the same fate as all other male characters in the original. Johnny boy takes a solid beating and is left for dead all bruised up and deformed, so... now he's ready to get his revenge and truly enter the grimy legend of Sin City right? NOPE, doesn't happen. What does happen? We are left hanging for about an hour or so before we see him again and there he is, re-introduced to us, all bruised up and again playing poker with the evil senator...The exact same situation from earlier except he's in for revenge this time, right?...NOPE! It won't happen. Basically the only thing that we get from the Johnny story is a contrived excuse to demonize the senator, and, as for Johnny, it turns out he was just some dumb but lucky fool who let his ego grow way too large for his brain to handle. Next, we are introduced to Josh Brolin's story, or what the filmmakers are trying to portray as a re-introduction to the character, Dwight, played in the original by Clive Owen, which was his best role in my opinion. This time around, Clive Owen, I mean, Josh Brolin, is reduced to a dull, lifeless, wanna-be, hero type, who is, essentially, a guy who has delusions of grandeur about his inner rage which, which unlike in the original movie, is never to be on display. Sadly, all of this just made me miss Clive Owen's Dwight that much more. The gorgeous Eva Green is introduced to us here as a dame to kill for, channeling the Carla Gugino bares it all scene from the original. She is completely nude for what seemed to be about ten minutes of screen time. Why? because there's not much else going on here. The filmmakers seemingly hit the jackpot by casting her, because she's the only actress willing to expose herself in the exploitative way the filmmakers most likely wanted the other actresses to do. At this point I will cut my review short because I believe the filmmakers cut the movie short and wanted to turn it into a lame soft-core porn flick, mainly because they knew they didn't have much to begin with. If only they would have spared us the re-introduction of the Michael Clarke Duncan (RIP) character played by Dennis ""don't quit your day job as the voice of the Allstate commercials"" Haysbert. If only they would have spared us the waitress role being reprised by a hideous looking and aptly named Lady Gaga, originally played by the sexy, yet angelic, Brittany Murphy. (RIP) If only they would have spared us the worst Bruce Willis cameo since Ocean's Twelve, playing a ghostly Obi Wan Kenobi figure for Jessica Alba to obsess over? If only they would have spared us watching the two shady detectives (Michael Madsen) story from the original played by two very fine actors Jeremy Piven and Chris Meloni who, in a cringe-worthy effort, essentially, just mail this one in for a paycheck. If only they would have spared us watching the beautiful Jessica Alba shake it for 90 minutes before giving her the main hero role for the final story, which only serves to help us realize she was perfect as she was in the first film, just twirling around the pole not really having much to do but look pretty. If only they would have spared us seeing Rosario Dawson's character, so hot and sexy the first time around, reduced to some dreary, mo-hawked, freaky looking prostitute character, who had no real reason to be in the sequel other than to tie the link between the Clive Owen/Josh Brolin character. In summation, the only lasting memory the filmmakers want you to have, is of Eva Green completely nude. To that, I say to the filmmakers of this abortion AKA a sequel, Robert ""don't call me Tarantino"" Rodriguez and Frank ""don't call me Nosferatu"" Miller...Mission accomplished!",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
205,vladtheimpaler416,Very entertaining but a little confusing.,9,14 September 2014,"Like most of Robert Rodriguez films the explosive and over the top blood makes his movies extremely fun. This is no exception, the phenomenal directing and story telling is complemented by amazing acting. The comic book style movie is absolutely amazing. Unfortunately the sequel doesn't offer any story connection to the first film, either you have to read the comics or look online for the story connection. The film all by its self is great but if your looking for a complete story line look some where else. Visually compelling and a quotable script makes for an extremely enjoyable movie. My advice is not to think about the first film, just enjoy the movie.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
206,AnAndalusianDog,Ehh; but Worth a Watch,7,22 August 2014,"Like all of the sequels which made in movie industry, this can't live up to expectations, at least for me. But it was fun to watch.Sin City, as an adaptation of comics was pretty good as it reflects the atmosphere very well. As for as I observe this one tried it but can't get near to it also the 3D nonsense. What was this for? It is simple to answer it: profit. I couldn't see anything in the movie which would be superb to see with 3D. Nothing but a headache. And Eva Green. This might be personal but I don't like the way she acts. Ruined it. Just a bunch of nipples and green eyes.Generally movie was good, and of course Mickey Rourke.It will be worth your money, believe me.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
207,jessemorrison99,I don't see why everyone hates it so much.,7,16 September 2014,"*Minor spoilers involving structure of the film, no plot points*In short, it isn't nearly as bad as everyone is saying. Let me elaborate. In case people don't know, the first Sin City from 2005 was based on the 1st, 3rd and 4th books in the 7 part series by Frank Miller. These follow the story lines of Marv, Dwight and Hartigan respectively. In addition to those, there are also a few shorts thrown in, either from the books or not. So, needless to say, Sin City and its sequel are both anthology films. If you want one single story that takes 2 hours, this may not be your thing. Sin City 2 follows almost the exact same structure as the original, which I found nice. Sure they didn't do anything original with the structure, which was sort of playing it safe, but I liked it. It felt familiar and reminded me of the original which I loved very much. It begins with another short story, this time starring Marv. It rocks. It continues on with a new story not contained in any of the books. It stars Johnny, a gambler who ""never loses"". Mid way through, we cut to another story. This is the 2nd book, titled ""A Dame to Kill For"". If you've read this, you won't see anything new. Like with the first film, they essentially translated the story from page to screen, and it works for the most part. There was one detail I didn't like, but it doesn't last long. Then after that, we finish up the story with Johnny, and finally, we get to the revenge mission involving Nancy and her hunt for Senator Rourke. That's all I'll say about that. Everyone is complaining about how the movie looks like a cutscene from a video game. They are sort of right, but not entirely. Even after waiting 2 weeks, I was unable to find a theatre in my city showing the film in 2d. It seems like this is happening more and more now. If you want to see an action movie in theatres, it's 3d whether you like it or not. Now, having not seen a 2d version to make a comparison, I can say that the 3d is most likely what makes it look so video game-y. I'm sure in 2d it'll look slightly better at least. Update: I did see it in 1080p and in 2D, and it does look less like a video game cutscene. You can still tell that there's a lot of CGI, but it's done better than a lot of films. Also, greenscreen sets have been used for over a decade now, I don't see why people are complaining so much. Everything is a CGI-fest these days, and this story, with a fantastic setting and extraordinary physics pulls it off nicely. You can tell, but it's far from awful. Everyone is saying they loved the first one, but hated this one. I don't see how that's possible. They stuck very close to the original in most ways, such as cinematography, soundtrack, and directing, all of which were great (for a Sin City movie). Sure it isn't a masterpiece my any means, and it's not as good as the first, but it's super entertaining, very violent, and is sure to please anyone who enjoys the books or the first film. Forget all those jaded movie snobs saying it sucks. They're just focusing on all the negatives, and letting that cloud their vision of the awesome stuff.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
208,itclark64,Same City,7,29 August 2014,"The tag line for the 2005 Sin City was ""Walk down the right back alley in Sin City and you can find anything""; the sequel walks down the same back alleys. Nine years later the visual style hasn't changed and it returns to the mostly same characters instead of exploring new ones. You would think in an entire city there would be more characters and more stories than the ones from the last movie. As enjoyable as the movie was and as good as it was to see some of the old faces again this sequel felt smaller than the original.A Dame to Kill For is very much a sequel to the original Sin City and that is not necessarily a good thing. The stories and art style are based off of Frank Miller's graphic novel series. The movie like the original is split up into three different stories that follow around three different characters in Sin City. Also like the original the stories are not in chronological order. The stories take place both before and after the stories in the original film, depending on which part your talking about. In the original the jumping around in chronology and moving to several different characters gave the feel of a larger city with many moving pieces. It would have been nice if they had expanded on that for the sequel. Instead they focus on pretty much the same main characters with some additional supporting characters. The stories aren't bad, they are actually quite good, just not as good as the original.If you've seen the trailers for this movie or saw the last movie you have a pretty good idea what the movie is going to look like. Robert Rodriguez crated a visual masterpiece in 2005 by adapting Frank Millers graphic novel style to film. If you've read any of the original graphic novels, watching these movies is essentially watching moving versions of those books, with sound. I wasn't going to see this movie in 3D since traditionally, dark movies are hard to see through 3D glasses. I accidentally selected the wrong showing and ended up watching it in 3D anyway. I was pleasantly surprised to see that it worked. The heavy contrast made it easy to see what I was supposed to see and the occasional 3D effect actually enhanced the experience. If your not a fan of 3D and don't want to pay the extra money for the the ticket, this wont be worth it to you but if you need to have the full experience, it definitely makes the movie better.I watched the original Sin City right before I went to see this one and I was reminded of how many actors in that movie have died in the past nine years. It's understandable that they left those characters out or had to replace the actors with new ones. Brittany Murphy passed away a few years ago and didn't have a large role in the first movie but it would have been nice to see her serving drinks again in the sequel. It was a tragedy when Michael Clark Duncan died. He played the intimidating Manute in the original and in this one is played by Dennis Haysbert, who does a good job filling those massive shoes. What I can't understand is, why did they replaced Clive Owen with Josh Brolin. Before I saw the movie I was hoping it would still work and I will talk more about why it doesn't work in the spoilers section. Lets just say I would have liked it better if Clive Owen returned. If you haven't seen the original then Josh Brolin's performance won't seem out of place. He's a good actor and plays the part well; its just an odd casting choice.It's really nice to see Mickey Rourke again as Marv. He's never the main character like the beginning of the 2005 Sin City but he's in most of the movie and everything you loved about the character before is still there. He's a violent brutish tough as nails criminal that decimates his enemies during conflicts but he does it for the best intentions. His character is all about protecting women who are unable to protect themselves. He asks nothing in return, he just believes that it's wrong to hit a girl and will break your face if you disagree with him.Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Eva Green have the most substantial new roles. The one new main character is played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. It's a good story but it's relatively short compared to the other two and isn't distinct enough to really stand out. Eva Green plays the titular Dame to Kill For and once again knocks it out of the park. She stole the show in the recent '300' sequel (also based on Frank Millers graphic novels) and she practically does it again in this movie. One more role like this and she is in danger of being typecast as a seductress....and I'm okay with that. In addition to the ultra violence throughout the film Eva Green's scenes give this movie its R rating. You see a lot of her. It's more than just sex though she is able to play a range of emotions and the audience as well as the other characters are swept along with her. She makes you believe that she is a dame to kill for and is the best part of the movie.Overall it was a good movie, it just didn't capture the magic of the original. It may be because it took nine years to make this sequel. It's a shame too, because I really like these movies and considering the box office numbers it's unlikely another one will get made.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
209,dorin_1987,The Boondocks,6,5 October 2014,"""Too late!"" - Two words to express our attitude to and fro the movie. This words was the first that came to mind on viewing the trailer, it also is the concentration of all the problems of the film, and an echo of the same word can be heard in the background is well known to us the soundtrack. ""Too late,"" Mr. Rodriguez. ""Too late,"" Mr. Miller Ten years have passed since the first part of the film, which has identified a miracle firsthand - noir comics, such as he is seen fans, and most importantly - the creator. Movie have become very popular, has acquired cult status and became a springboard for the careers of fading pair of actors. Exactly since there was talk about the second part, the good stories in the city of sin is enough for a good trilogy. This idle talk was destined to remain in the status of those ten years. That's how much Rodriguez and comic book writer, and part- time co-author Frank Miller movie, tormented fans waiting. That just does not see the audience during this time: a long line of candidates allegedly stellar cast, which fell on the various rumors and Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp; and a list of stories that supposedly adapted for shooting; and ""Grindhouse"" - a joint cheerful idiocy Rodriguez and Tarantino; «Spirit» - solo attempt directed by Miller in an attempt to prove that he did not need Robert, ""Machete"" - which showed that Rodriguez can make trash film from any trailer; and ""Machete - 2"", which showed that Rodriguez in repeat itself mode - nasty spectacle; and even the TV series ""Spartacus"", which showed three seasons as gentle on the manner of the Miller supply color and gore Rodriguez. The intensity of waiting for this time reached its peak, got stung for a while with a bright flame, and then began to fade. Well, what you want, if in ten years on the components of the original drags by bad cinema creators and made crap from any of them? This once happened to the shaky camera of the Bourne trilogy. And in the end, instead: «F * ck yeah !! Sin City 2 !!! ""response was in the style of"" Sin City 2? ... Yeah, silly subtitle. "" The atmosphere is not addictive as if the effect of novelty faded. It turned out that the original city, which is both frightening and attracted, turned into a backwater from which we left many years ago, and came back and realized that this is a real hole. Even in this situation can be the winner. Just something and you need to do all the large-scale, steeper and the original file, using new techniques, and most importantly - to write a good script, expanding and multiplying the idea and atmosphere of the original. And here comes the understanding that absolutely nothing of the above has not been done. City - all the same, to the same extent and in the amounts, moreover, it seems that the events of the first part of the live only in the memory of loyal fans, and the creators - completely lost its memory. Well, in fact, how else to explain the fact that many of the events of the second part are contrary to the original? And even that could be played in the plus to picture, turn it focus, which is well worked out only a couple of sequels - namely almost depart from the original stories, virtually eliminating it, and at the same time, it remains to build something different, better, Large-scale, developing the idea of the first film. James Cameron someone cranked it a couple of times. «Sin City» ... same. Well, you get the idea. Makes a little smile that the original marking cynically - in full accordance with the customs of the inhabitants of Basin City. There is in this very perverse irony. Marv suddenly with, with nothing of the half-witted thugs with the makings of a philosopher becomes the best friend of half the characters; Dwight, a small thing that has changed the face so with guise replaced and character, turned into a rag, and not becoming better during his short stories; Ghost Hartigan, do not understand for what he come for; Levitt character - gives no-t-hing to Sin City history; absolutely no need to prehistory Miho; and apotheosis - story Nancy. Remember: ""The old man is dying ... Girl is live. Fair exchange? ""Spit, trampled forgotten. But it was almost the most emotional moment ten years ago. What would somehow brighten fans view, we were given Eva Green and her charms. She (they?) - Certainly are an ornament of the film, sorry about her character does not. Another of the joys: creators cameo, couple flashbacks, new BDSM Costumes Rosario Dawson, a few interesting visual findings and a bunch of missed opportunities. And it could even ride, leave the film in the year following the original ... Even with all the above heap of pros and cons, the film does not look nasty, not tedious or unpleasant. Time spent was not sorry. Sorry for the perfect movie that ten years after the original, has degenerated into a story of loser who are lucky in gambling, babbling about the woman without the ability to plan in the long term, and a stripper, perform heroic deeds ... But for what she had not doing, committed suicide almost the best resident Sin City ... Recommend to a viewing? Most likely - yes, but only if you love the original, and opportunities to forgive him a lot. And in general: too late, Mr. Rodriguez and Mr. Miller. Spoon the road for dinner. Ten years later, in this godforsaken place, such as ""Sin City - 2"", this the spoon can be tucked in the most unexpected hole, by hands the most loyal fans.

Like any sequel, it had to deal with conflicting goals of consistency and novelty.Sin City 2 maintained consistency by returning most of the major characters,including my favorite, Marv. Miho and Manute were recast, but their characters still felt familiar.The new elements are the story lines: a new short with Marvin, another short with a new character, a long prequel story with Dwight, and the closing extension of ""That Yellow Bastard"". Grafted into the context of the original Sin City, they work pretty smoothly, but I spotted a couple seams in the plot constructs.The original played with the time line as it revealed the nature of Basin City. Sin City 2 tells things in direct sequence, and without those additional shifts in focus the story telling is a bit flatter. In Sin City 2 we see a higher body count and the longer battles scenes. The extra blood and body parts dilute the action and remove some of the tension that's part of the original.Sin City 2 does throw in a couple surprise cameos: Chris Meloni shows us how SVU's Det. Elliot Stabler would behave in a alternate universe, and Jabba the Hutt shows us what he'd look like recast to mostly human form. I enjoyed the alternate Stabler; Jabba, not so much.Not having seen the original in the theater, I was looking forward to seeing how its graphic style played on a really big screen.

It may just be be cause the style lost some of its original appeal, but I thought it didn't live up to its predecessor. With that said, I still thought A Dame to Kill For was a great time at the movies. Everything about it was solid. It continued the action from the first and did not fail to keep me at the edge of my seat. And, Marv was his normal, b.a. self.A Dame to Kill for consists of two story lines that are prequels to those of the first Sin City and one that is a sequel.

A dame to kill for doesn't have a great plot (if you could even call it one), and that was my biggest disappointment. Sin city was good from start to finish.

Instead of building up mysical energy they just completely drown everything in some decent substans just to make some cash.I didn't care for any char in this movie. And i din't think anyone was cool or anything close to that. Everyone was just LAME. Imo they should have framed the story-in with with Eva and tried to made this movie more to the ""horror""-genre.

218,ashoklich,Unusual and fascinating,8,15 November 2014,"I honestly do not remember the 1st outing of Sin City, but this one just blew me away. There are a couple of story lines that the viewer follows, and there is enough graphic violence and nudity to captivate. The conversion of a comic book style to a movie with real actors is what fascinated me the most about this movie.Arrows pierce through heads, blood spurts like a fountain, red lips and green eyes adorn a black and white face. Awesome.The dialog could be called either very cool or very dumb, depending on your point of view. But having no clear expectations when I sat down to watch this movie perhaps helped me enjoy it tremendously.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
219,Crabnebula1914,"A Dame, blah blah blah.... For",5,22 August 2014,"Sin City is a noir infused fever dream. Every corner hosts a sleazy bar, and each is home to an array strippers, crooked cops, broken men, broken dreams, and every class of criminal. Crooked cops ride the streets by the command of even more crooked politicians. Drinks are cheap and life is even cheaper. If you find yourself in Old Town, you had better behave yourself: the sultry women of the night are probably the most deadly of all. Robert Rodriguez struck gold in 2005 with his first Sin City entry, an ultra violent, digitally crafted surrealistic revision of film noir. A great cast, complete with interconnected story lines, voice overs, memorable lines, and action galore. His long awaited sequel Sin City: A Dame to Kill For has all the same stylized environments, depraved characters, twisted stories, and eye popping visuals. But it doesn't have the same level of potent energy as the first volume.The film opens with potential: Marv (ornery as ever) is having a bout of memory loss, trying to figure out why he's surrounded by dead college kids and twisted vehicles. Sounds good right? Well it is. After a rousing opening scene, this follow up seems like it's going to deliver the goods with the same vigor that left us wanting more after nearly ten years. Sin City: A Dame to Kill For has the ingredients, talent, and ingenuity to equal – or even surpass – it's first entry. Rodriguez and Frank Miller wok in concert recreate the atmospheric Basin City. Following the story of the original graphic novel, the film follows a more linear narrative. Many characters from the first movie reprise their roles, but a bulk of the film centers on a new spread of citizens. Dwight, (Josh Brolin) plays a photographer who, in the noir tradition, is dispatched to photograph cheating spouses, or reputable figures in ""compromising"" positions. After a meeting with his former lover Eva, Dwight realizes she's in danger. Enlisting the help of the unstoppable man machine Marv, the two storm the castle to save the day. Although the ensuing action is done with Rodriguez flare, the characters that populate this entry are simply not that interesting.In the first Sin City, protagonists were motivated by a sense of honor, or actions they deemed honorable. It may have been grim, but predators and murderers were receiving some good old fashioned vigilante justice. And, those characters were fun to root for. This outing is populated by layers of manipulation and greed. It makes for a dense story, but gives us little to root for, and the antagonists comeuppance is less satisfying.The film is made up of a great cast, yet so many of them have little screen time, it's hard to be excited. Ray Liotta, Christopher Lloyd, and Jeremy Piven are limited to about one scene each. It feels less like good casting and more of a way to show off. Stacy Keach is on the bill, but if it weren't for the opening credits, he would probably go unrecognized since he's under so much makeup. Christopher Meloni's (whose lack of presence in feature films is puzzling; he's a wonderful actor) performance is hidden behind a cartoonishly large pair of glasses. Joseph Gordon Levitt fits the shoes of the ultra slick player who goes by ""Johnny."" Eva Green is the main Femme Fetale, although the proper term for her should be Femme Evile. She truly is nasty as, ""The Dame to Kill For"". Actors who revisit their characters provide some of the best scenes. Powers Booth is back as Senator Roark and has more screen time. People will perk up when Bruce Willis walks in the door of the Kadies, but will soon be disappointed once they realize he's an apparition. Jessica Alba is back on the dance floor as Nancy Callahan, Mickey Rourke is Marv, and Rosario Dawson is still magnetic as Gail. Jamie Chung as the memorable Miho is one of the film's strong points.It seems as if Robert Rodriguez forgot that nine years ago he created an imaginative, highly original noir underworld. Embracing digital technology, this enabled the collaboration with Frank Miller to bring his stylized revisionist graphic novels to life. Sin City was released as Sin City, meaning it wasn't bound to one specific narrative thread. Drawing on different stories from Frank Millers series, Sin City almost felt like an anthology film. Yet, the scenes worked together and their narrative threads made a cohesive and entertaining film. This outing is bound to the Dame to Kill For story. Compelling, but not as imaginative or witty as the work Miller and Rodriguez previously collaborated on. Both films carry a considerable amount of sexuality. This time around, little is left to the imagination. Thinking about that long, sloppy kiss between Clive Owen and Rosalie Dawson on a rainy street side conjures up an air of flattering sexuality. After A Dame to Kill For, I'm trying to shake the image of Ray Liotta tossing himself around on top of a woman handcuffed to a bed. It's not that A Dame to Kill For is a bad film. It has the same style and flavor of the first Sin City movie, but falls short on imagination. Since they have such a rich well of material to draw from, it leaves one to wonder why they didn't take advantage of Miller's broad creative output. The argument isn't wishing for a mere retread. Because of the freedom enabled by the digital backlot production, Rodriguez can take them wherever they please. Visual indulgences are present throughout, but the images don't make the impression one would expect. Fans of Frank Millers graphic novels will enjoy the film for it's faithful depiction – others might be left wanting.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For

222,ggood1234,"Continuity issues, poor choreography, unbelievable character motivations/actions",6,5 September 2014,"I wanted to like this movie, I really did. I loved the first and bought the special edition not just once on DVD, but then again on Blu-ray.First let me say, the main storyline (Dwight's) was mostly good. JGL's however, was nonsensical and a waste of time. Why didn't he heed the cop at the poker game's warning, especially if he had no plan or means of protecting himself? Really. Why would he willingly get in the car after beating up the two thugs? What was the purpose? Why the *bleep* would he go back a second time with no greater plan other than to beat the governor at poker AGAIN. You know, the thing that got him in trouble in the first place? Makes no sense. Would have been sooo much better if he had hidden a gun in his bandages, even if it had been an unsuccessful attempt.Nancy's storyline... ugh. This is where continuity went waaay off the rails. Dwight's storyline was a PREQUEL to the first Sin City movie. After his surgery, Josh Brolin, looks like Clive Owens character in the first film (both playing Dwight), and Manute (played by the late Michael Clarke Duncan) already had his eye missing in the first film. Hence, prequel. Nancy's storyline, SEQUEL, somehow... And what a stupid, lazy, unbelievable storyline it was. It's like it was tacked onto the end of the film (notice there was no more jumping between story lines) because they simply ran out of actual story and needed to fill time (or it was the only way Alba would agree to do the film). I still don't know if Booth's character was actually in her room or not, but either way, it makes no sense.Besides the glaring issues above, much of the choreography in the action sequences was unbelievable, and not in a good way. People flying off at weird angles. Marv's silly double cop closeline through the windshield that would have made much more sense in one motion flying off the car in front of them. Nancy downing 3 armed guards, adjacent to each other, with a crossbow... in 1 second. The guards at Eva Green's mansion chilling out, smoking, waiting to be arrowed in the head, AFTER Rosario Dawson set off a huge bomb in the courtyard a few hundred feet away at most? Yeah.It's really too bad, but this movie just feels like a lazy money-grab, trying to cash in on popularity of the first.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For

First the positive things about this motion picture; in my humble opinion the visual affects and acting are truly amazing and that reminds me why I love Sin City, especially Mickey Rourke who killed it once again as Marv. Atmosphere, action and dialogues are very good also. Directors did a good job but writing and story could be better. Some scenes are predictable, too unrealistic and just too much.

224,gavinconlon,"""Sin City: A Dame to Kill For"" Doesn't Live Up to Expectations",6,23 August 2014,"The first Sin City completely baffled me. It had amazing cinematography and it blended with great action and some amazing stories. I didn't want the movie to end. Now after 9 years of waiting for another installment in this franchise you can see how I was expected so much from this film. The movie begins with hungover Marv waking up surrounded by dead young men trying to piece together his previous night. The first Sin City began with an intriguing story with Bruce Willis playing the role of an old veteran cop trying to take down a group of serial rapists before they take their next victim. Even within the first 10 minutes of the first movie it showed betrayal, action and violence. The first 102 minutes could barely provide those three things in this second film. The only intriguing moments of this movie are when Eva Green is naked (which takes up 50% of the movie) and Jessica Alba is dancing with barely any clothes on (which is the other 50% of the movie). When a hero dies in this movie I don't feel remorse, I don't feel anything at all because I didn't feel like I could connect with the characters enough throughout the movie. This movie hardly provides any interesting plot lines and even less interesting characters. I still give this movie a 6/10 because of Eva Green's boobs, Jessica Alba's dancing, and it's average-at-best action. But sadly none of those could save this movie from itself.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
225,NathanMack,Very Disappointing,3,1 January 2016,"I gave this film a 3/10 although I feel that is very generous and more of soft spot for the brilliant work done on the first film. This sequel lacks everything that made the first movie great.The Dwight character continues in this movie but this time portrayed by Josh Brolin rather than Clive Owen. Clive Owen was fantastic in the original but Brolin seems out of his depth in this one. Not the role for him. The Dwight character became awkward and almost seemed weak, seriously lacked the presence of Clive Owens ""Dwight"".Nancy and Marv return in a conjoined story line (Although Marv has his hands in all the story lines really). Marv was my favourite character in the original Sin City but in this sequel it is almost like he is used as comic relief. His one liners seem forced and contrived and his impact in this film is unmemorable (compared to the original)There is a new character in the sequel called Johnny (Played by Joseph Gordon-Levitts). His story line seems pointless and seems to be gap filler more than anything. A waste of talent for someone I was very excited to see in this film. The ending of his storyline was very stupid as well.One final downer was the cameo of Christopher Lloyd. Was so excited to see his name in the credits and was looking forward to his appearance all film. Unfortunately I blinked and nearly missed it. Another under-use of a brilliant actor. Was expecting much more from this as I believe I gave the original 9/10. We will always have the original I guess.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For

When lovers Dwight and Ava are reunited, everything looks promising. But in Sin City, a reunion is never good news And Ava has plans for Dwight.Review:In 2005, director Robert Rodriguez and graphic novelist Frank Miller collaborated for the first time bringing Millers infamous and stylized Sin City series to the movie screen. It was a critical and commercial success, screening at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival and praised for the films unique colour processing. However, it has taken the cast and crew almost a decade to create a sequel, Sin City: A Dame to Kill For, mainly based on the short story ""Just Another Saturday Night"", which is in Millers sixth book in the series: Booze, Broads & Bullets. Two original stories were also penned exclusively for the film by Miller. With Rodriguez taking post as a Co-Director, Producer, Cinematographer, Editor and penning some of the original score. Making his role a heavy burden and a large and stressful task. This however is his trademark, having accomplished these tasks successfully in the past with films such as Sin City and Machete.Although I often groan at the fact of Sequels. Sin City: A Dame To Kill For was music to my ears, knowing that Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller would be taking the helm. As a fanatic of the first film, I personally wished a sequel had come sooner, especially with material having already being written through Frank Millers visionary and innovative comic series. In regards to this, the crew push both the visuals and its distinctive colour processing to its boundaries as we as an audience, expect to see the highly stylized neo-noir in this form. Making for another great movie experience, likewise with the first in the franchise. Josh Brolin, takes over acting duties from Clive Owen as Dwight McCarthy. A tough and insightful character, leading the narrative this time round. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, a newcomer to the franchise is Johnny. An arrogant and opinionated young man who cannot stop winning at Gambling. Even if it costs him more than he bargained for. Regulars Mickey Rourke, continues to delight the audience with his dark, dangerous and menacing character Marv. Who continues on his rampage by taking out a group of frat boys and aiding Dwight in his personal mission. In addition to this, Jessica Alba reprises her role as the delightful, yet cunning Nancy Callahan. Who this time round is hallucinating images of Hartigan, channelling her rage through her provocative dancing. Out to set things right, she looks to avenge her lover and father figure by slaughtering the powerful Senator Roark, reprised by Powers Boothe. Eva Green also stars as Ava, a seductive and desirable female and lover of Dwight McCarthy, without her on screen, we sincerely feel her absence as an audience. Sin City: A Dame To Kill For may sound as a promising sequel, but the originality no longer exists leaving the audience to enjoy its plot and narrative. Which isn't all that compelling or gripping even with Frank Miller writing the Screenplay after his beloved novels. Sin City: A Dame To Kill For is quite bland, in general terms it could be considered to be a typical revenge flick, with some beautiful colour grading and a talented ensemble of actors. It does however expand the world of Basin City, delivering some expectations to its audience and introducing some fantastic characters to the big screen. The Cinematography delivers and I have to admire the films beauty with its neo-noir approach and its stunning methods in regards to colour grading. However Sin City: A Dame To Kill For just feels dreary and in fairness, not all of the performances fit as well as you may expect. More often than not, Sin City becomes tedious and for a movie what contains brutality, sex and exploitation. It is a major surprise to me as an audience member for such themes to be so dull. Whilst Josh Brolin's scenes are of the most importance, it was the character Johnny I enjoyed watching the most. I would have in fact favoured his character to take the Lead Role and be interconnected to the other characters much more than he actually is.Verdict:Sin City: A Dame To Kill For, retains its gritty and gruelling look what made the first Sin City so entertaining. Yet it does not make for a good story and leaves questions unanswered.6/10 - Average.Yours Truly,Rhys Atkinson.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
228,evaminos82,Not as good as Sin City,5,3 September 2014,"BASED ON FRANK MILLER'S COMIC BOOK AND DIRECTED BY ROBERTO RODRIGUEZ this violent film noir/superhero/anti-hero movie, is a continuation to the first Sin City (2005) and in 3D this time. Filmed in black and white, the style is truly exceptional (although not innovative) as it wants to look exactly like a comic book in black and white with a dash of bright colour. The only thing missing are the speech and thought bubbles! The visual aspects of the film are very beautiful and from an artistic point of view, the use of bright colours with black and white worked really well, especially Jaime King bright orange hair, and Eva Green's bright red lipstick and bright green eyes, although making her look like a vampire at times. However, the typical femme fatale character from traditional film noir is very well portrayed with more nudity this time although keeping it always artistic.There is also lots of violence and blood spilling/guts splashing/bones cracking, keeping it faithful to Roberto Rodriguez style (Desperado, from Dusk till Dawn). Even if one tries their best to make the voice over effective, it still makes the pace of the film slow as this was intended to replace the thought bubbles of various characters. The film can feel slow at times due to long shots and close ups and doesn't flow very well due to the parallel stories of multiple characters that don't necessarily intertwine. The characters can seem dull at times, and killing seems the only means to an end. The audience follows three parallel stories of ""anti- heroes"" journeys:The need to feel loved for Dwight, revenge for the murder of his mother for Johnny, and avenge her loved one (ghost appearance of Bruce Willis) by Nancy. Therefore, killing the low-lives of this city filled with sin and despair. Although the first film was such a success due to its novelty and high calibre actors, the second one didn't succeed in developing characters centred story, or even a strong plot. The imagery is definitely the strong point of the film and its best quality. Perhaps worth to read the comic book to compare and if the book works better than a film as drawing movements cannot be conveyed the same way on screen even if one tries its best. Bruce Willis five minutes appearance seems to appear only for audience wishes.Saying that, Mickey Rourke's character and Joseph Gordon-Levitt's seems to be the characters that stay in the viewer's mind after watching it due to good acting and hero-like characters that audiences love from other MARVEL films.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For

Yet its bizarre mixture of cartoonish ultra-violence, cheesy dialogue, and noire aesthetic come together to create something incredibly unique. It is also a film that makes good use of 3D, as at times it looks like you are staring at a three dimensional diorama of a comic book frame, and it is beautiful.The cast is strong, although with so many big names a lot of them only end up getting a few minutes of screen time. Mickey Rourke returns as Marv, and is clearly the heart of the movie, featuring in three of the four stories in major roles. Josh Brolin takes over for Clive Owen as Dwight, which works well given the darker tone in A Dame to Kill For. As for Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Johnnie, a newcomer to the franchise, Gordon-Levitt does well enough with the role, but Johnnie's story itself is rather forgettable. Jessica Alba returns as Nancy, and is both appropriately sexy and scary at the same time. The casting couldn't have been better.The plot itself consists of four loosely connected stories featuring the four lead protagonists respectively, it does feel a little rougher during the transitions between them compared to the original Sin City. The titular story, A Dame to Kill For, certainly stands out among the four, and fans will be more than pleased with this adaptation of one of the most beloved Sin City comics.Sin City: A Dame to Kill For may not be as innovative or as seamless as the original, but it is still a great, unique piece of cinema.Now I hope you don't mind me saying this...

It was decent enough, nothing close to the first movie though Na, it can't even hold a candle to itGuess they decided to change up the format a bit for this one, go with a more linear storytelling structure than the previous. Still not technically one single story, more like 3 intertwining stories that connect at points throughout, but it was told in one fluid motion rather than the way it was done in Sin City 1, where they split the stories into a series of short films.That's not to say the story wasn't good, I just don't think that Sin City 1 really screamed out for a sequel, it ended perfectly the way it did. But with this one we get a look into the lives of the characters from the first in a bit more depth, some stories set before Sin City 1, some after.They still decided to stick with that whole, black & white, ""Film Noir"" style, using colour only to highlight things and for not-so- subtle symbolism, such as green eyes when a certain someone tries to control people with lust and envy.Bruce Willis was also sorely lacking from this film, showing up only once or twice, which is understandable considering the first movie, I won't say more for fear of spoilers, but it was still a bit sad. Jessica Alba also making a re-appearance in this one, with a far more interesting and lengthier role.So what can I really say about this movie, Sin City: A Dame To Kill For? Cheesy acting, clichéd one-liners and plots, lots of ""Max Payne-style"" monologuing and seeming like it was trying to give itself credit for more depth than it actually had. I enjoyed it! Admittedly, not quite as much as the first, and having never read the graphic novels, I have no comparison to them, but for what it was, I found it fairly enjoyable, if dragging a little bit at points.Sometimes cheesy acting improves a performance, sometimes clichéd one-liners are exactly what is needed. The monologuing gets a little annoying at times but it's a useful storytelling device, if a bit overused in this movie.Overall, I say it's worth a watch. If you liked Sin City 1, then you'll at least appreciate this one.

However, this is nothing short of ridiculous. The highlight of the film is Marv (Rourke), although his role has been severely restricted by the film. There is no real charisma within any character in the film and the main roles are played by actors so weak that it almost becomes a joke. The funniest part of the film (and I mean funny) was making Jessica Alba have the finale. Which simply does not work! Bruce Willis should not have been in this film. I always thought Clive Owen was the weakest actor from the first film but the cast in this film takes it to a whole new level. The stories are interlinked, but extremely loosely. There is nothing to draw you emotionally into the stories and it almost feels as if they are trying to cram in as much of the original film as they can. They would have been better off starting from scratch. The entire last story line does not make sense. It feels as if they put Rourke in it just to rescue the film.

Like the original the movie is divided into different segments that are loosely connected in some cases and heavily in others. This structuring works similar to the original though not as well certain segments are split when they probably shouldn't of been which kind of hurts the momentum. Despite this the movie does have a hidden narrative the descent of Nancy as every story at least glimpses her showcasing her increasing aggression, elements of her arc even appear in other stories, more on Nancy when we reach her segment.The movie is divided into three stories and a prologue the prologue is so short you really can't count it, though it is a fun opening that reintroduces us to Marv in great fashion. The first story called The Long night an original story not part of the comic features Joseph Gordon Levitt who plays a charming young man with a talent for gambling and a case of good luck his skills and luck ultimately pit him against Senator Roark, in a rather intriguing struggle. While short this story works as a brief tale and unravels at a fast pace with a rather unexpected yet satisfying ending. Powers Booth delivers a strong performance as Roark in this section giving Sin City a villain presence it has sorely lacked.The second story is the titled dame to kill for and this story is definitely the highlight of the movie and in my opinion the strongest segment in both movies. Josh Brolin does a good job as Dwight filling in for Clive Owen, while Mickey Roark returns in a larger role as Marv and as awesome and lovable as ever. Unfortunately the great Micheal Clark Duncan passed but Dennis Haysbert does a good job filling in as Manute. The girls of old town return as well and as sexy and deadly as they ever were. However the star of this segment is Eva Green as Ava Lord she really knocks it out of the park with this role embodying everything a true femme fatale is and gives the franchise it's most memorable villain. The story is well paced and takes up about half the movie and it's worth it all, this segment alone makes the movie worth seeing truly some of the best material of either movies.The final story is Nancy's last dance. This story contains some of the most intriguing parts of the movie as we watch as Hartigans death causes Nancy to slowly spiral downwards, we see as she becomes more angry bitter and full of hatred intriguingly enough Nancy's descent is mostly shown through her dances at the club as each one gradually loses the beauty it had and becomes more sexual and aggressive to the point that Marv becomes disgusted at what she is becoming. These sections are very good seeing Nancy fall apart through her grief and her rage towards Roark and Hartigan raises the character stuff above most Sin City stories. Unfortunately it kind of falls apart once Nancy sets out on her revenge the action is good but it all comes off as very rushed and we aren't given the same level of closure as in the first especially regarding Nancy's character who definitively needed more of a resolution to her story. As such Nancy's last dance delivers many of the best parts of the movie with a pretty good performance by Jessica Alba but it doesn't reach it's full potential because the end point is rushed.So where does this put the movie exactly? The performances are about the same and story quality is similar the A Dame to kill for segment as I said is probably better than anything in the first movie, Nancy's last dance gives a great and dark arc to Nancy and the villains are far more memorable these areas not only match the first but actually exceed it however the segments aren't broken as well as they could be and don't have the same level of connection in particular the long night and Nancy's last dance should've been one story as bits of Nancy's story even are shown in the former just do a little more to connect them and it could work they are just too short separately and of course Nancy's last dance was rushed. So when you weight out these two sides I would say it the two movies are about equal, A Dame to kill For matches and even exceeds the first in many areas but it also falls short more often than the first did where that leaves it for me is about the same level as the original maybe a little lower. Either way Sin City a Dame to kill for was a solid follow up to the original that fans should check out.7.5/10",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For

245,Cardoni,Worth Watching if you liked the First One,6,23 November 2014,"Sin City movies remind me of Kill Bill 1 and 2. If it wasn't for short dialogues of this movie and a little faster pace I wouldn't have been surprised it I saw ""Tarantino"" in front of ""director"". But where Tarantino loves long dialogues and slower story telling, this one packs lots of action and story inside story for the whole length of the movie. Sin City 2.0 will entertain you just like the first one. If you watched the last one to the end then I thin actually you will like this one a little better.A note on the actors though. I think Joseph Gordon choice was poor. He is too small for this movie. I would have liked to see Keanu Reeves instead. I gave this move a 7 rating, but I feel a little guilty because I feel like our expectations are getting lower when it comes to movies. Talk about acting. Compare the masked and cliché and animated performances in this movie to the likes of No Country for Old men, or 21 grams, or Blue Valentine.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
246,attila-craftstar,Its OK,7,23 August 2014,"So as a hyped little Hungarian sin city fan I am I watched the movie yesterday in all its 3D glory with original dub. For those that haven't read the comics, the ""Dame to kill for"" part is almost a 100% carbon copy of the comic in question. Whats sad tho is that the dialogue sounds out of place a lot of times, when actually spoken and on top of that there's little grace in the whole dame character mostly due to poorly done ""sex scenes"" and showing too much. Not that Eva Green is not beautiful, its just retarded to see her get humped by a dog on meth. I will probably have to re-watch this part again once it comes to DVD, but right now my feelings are too mixed. The part was faithful to the comic, but poorly executed at times so as a fan i can give it a 6/10.The beginning of the movie is just great and captivating with Marv. I don't want to say much so ill just give it a 10/10.The Johnny part, in my opinion was the peak of the movie (except the opening ofc). Joseph Gordon Levit does a great job playing a character thats entirely new, and the whole story has a good pace. Altho they probably should have left out the part where Johhny is a Rourke as it seems to have served zero purpose, outside of punctuating the fact that the senator just doesn't give a fck. This part I can give a 8/10.The Nancy revenge part is just stupid. The only purpose it serves is to give a ""happy"" ending to the storyline that was in the previous movie, and by doing so it actually violates the whole atmosphere of Sin City. If Alba's boobs were showed I'd give it a higher rating, but since they weren't a 4/10.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
247,sim_belanger1,Exactly what I expected it to be,8,22 August 2014,"When I learned this movie was in the works, I was hoping it would be as gory, raw, gritty, stylish, and over the top as the first was. And it is!Like the first Sin City (2005), the movie alternates between several characters and their stories. It also looks the same, feels the same, and with mostly the same actors appearing on screen (though with a sad nod at the absence of Clive Owen), the fact that this second volume has been released a long 9 years after the original is quickly forgotten.I have to say that Eva Green's performance as the character Ava Lord is really the strongest point of the movie for me. She's electric on screen, and hot, sexy, mesmerizing even with those glowing green eyes. She steals the show, and not just because of her constant, and apparent, lack of a clothing wardrobe. The story arc featuring her character was the movie's best, in my opinion.Mickey Rourke as Marv, Powers Boothe as Senator Roark, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Johnny also delivered great, convincing performances that really draw you into the chaotic and villainous world of Sin City. It was really fun seeing Marv kicking some ass again, as was expected of him. Senator Roark is, obviously, still as despicable and antagonistic as he was in the first film, and Johnny, well, he's a bag full of surprises.As far as the other characters go, I think they did a pretty good job. Jessica Alba conveyed a rather emotional performance, which I wasn't expecting, and the addition of Ray Liotta, Lady Gaga, and Juno Temple were welcomed surprises. I enjoyed the return of Rosario Dawson, Bruce Willis, and Jaime King as well. Really helps rooting us into the world of Sin City, even with brief appearances.Sadly, I feel like Josh Brolin's character, Dwight, wasn't fully working. Although he was a central character to the movie, the fact that it was another actor portraying the role took its toll on the final product. Dwight didn't really feel like Dwight, at least to me.As a last nod, I really think that all the little connections made with the first movie were brief enough, but not intrusive. They were well placed, and great for those who watched and remember the first movie.Overall, it's, in my opinion, a satisfying sequel to a great movie, and I really hope that a third volume will be made. I want more Sin City!",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
248,Entropyacres,Testosterone Fest,1,30 August 2014,"Lame, pretentious, offensive dreck disguised as art set in a city where the men are ugly and the (much younger) women can't keep their clothes on. Guys, if you want to discourage a date, here's your movie. If she isn't turned off by the misogyny, she will be by the gore. The story line is simplistic and so is the dialogue. This movie is just about as flat and stupid as a kid's cartoon, only with boobs. And blood. And other body parts. I'm no prude, but I would have had a more favorable opinion of this movie if the other half of the audience was given some eye candy. This movie is set in black and white, the creators apparently believing that saturating the exposures and using black ink makes the film ""arty"". Strangely, women are in color. I suppose one needs a Y chromosome to know why. There have been many successful attempts to turn a good graphic novel into a good movie. This isn't one of them. I suppose one has to start with good material.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
249,hammy2610,Male Kill Bill Tarantino Comic,6,15 January 2015,"Being my first review I'm brand new to this so hear goes .....I thought I would love this movie, the idea of a comic book style action movie sounds just up my street for a enjoyable movie. All characters are brilliant in their own right but the raunchy Jessica Alba is the star. The moves she pulls off would do stuff to a snowman that isn't possible. Story is easy to follow, so you could watch this while catching up on some paper work or even the hovering because most of the storyline is irrelevant. It is put together uniquely but not my cup of tea but worth the watch. Overall I enjoyed this movie but it's not one I would be longing to watch again. The second 300 movie had the same effect on me, OK but that's it really, OK.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
250,DreadScythe95,The movie is a worthy follower of the first and has fallen victim of the critics like many other sequels of successful movies,10,21 September 2014,"The movie was as impressive as the first one. It lacked a bit in the story part compared to the first but it was an 8 years later sequel anyway. The performance of Eva Green was top of the class and I can say that she was the top character of the movie and Jessica Alba was as good as the first time. Marv(Rourke) was on point and Gordon Levvit had role that shined because of his personality. Lady Gaga played her small role perfectly but I'm not surprised like some others cause I already knew from before that she had great acting abilities and she has a persona that helps her a lot in movies like this one. The scenery was better than ever and the darkness swallowed everything. The dialogues were very good even though not as good as in the first movie. My only disappointment was that Dwight wasn't played by Clive Owen again but it's 8 years later and we can't have everything. Senator Roark was a highlight as well, he fitted very well on the role.Anyway most people that I know and have seen the first movie as well agree with me this second movie is a worthy successor of the first one regardless if it's better or worse and I definitely enjoyed it as much.It is a dame to kill for and I'm sad that the critics devoured it in negativity.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
251,krausingtiger24,Eva Green has breasts,5,28 August 2014,"Cheesy one liners and a mediocre looking woman's breasts does not make a good movie. I had little expectations for this movie, and my hesitations were just. Special effects were nicely done, but was a little much. I know what to expect from Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller... c.g fx not much dialog and not much direction. You guys need to get together with Michael Bay and Christopher Nolan and go back to school. Hopefully this school is taught by Peter Jackson, spike Lee and Ron Howard, so they can give you direction on how to direct. People want to see a movie, not a fireworks show. The original cast was spectacular together, and meshed well with the artfully done fx. This one just seemed too concentrated on the fx and less on the content. Joseph Gordon lovely face should never be a bad-ass... ever ever ever. 140 pounds of bone and water makes a weasel, not a tough guy. Quentin Tarantino can make cheesy look good, but knows when to get serious. Rodriguez should know better. Any way, this movie probably deserves less than a five, but I did like the fx for the most part and Jessica alba cutting her face up and stumbling around on stage made this movie almost tolerable. This IS however, what Americans usually want, but Michael Bay can only ruin old cartoons and TnT. People really need to stop going to his movies, and now Rodriguez is also on my banned list. Congrats on surpassing Christopher Nolan as top 5 franchise wreckers.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
252,fatacad,Thoroughly entertaining and thoroughly forgettable,6,8 October 2015,"This movie was fun to watch. I had a blast watching it, when it was over I thought it was cool, and now 6 hours later I am having trouble remembering it. That explains A Dame to Kill For. It's a fun, cheesy ride while it lasts but it lacks any of the lasting qualities of the first one. I hate to compare it to the first Sin City like most reviewers do but I can't help but jump on the bandwagon and say that it just isn't as good. The first Sin City was a work of art. It had witty dialog, an engrossing atmosphere and intriguingly intertwined story lines. This sequel has great CGI effects, but seems to have sacrificed all other qualities that made the first film great in lieu of special effects and big budget actors. The dialog is cheesy, emotional effect is limited and the stories and characters are honestly just not that interesting. With that said, it is definitely an entertaining watch but without the intellect and badass vibe from the first one. Don't expect another masterpiece, but it is a fun way to kill a couple of hours when you need to.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For

254,nagybalu,Bland.,4,15 November 2014,"I'd like to begin by saying the original 2005 Sin City is one of my favorite movies. The way it was put together, the cinematography, the characters, the dialogue...everything. It was truly a breakthrough film. This sequel however is a letdown. It's not the type of letdown where the product can't match the hype, it's just everything I enjoyed about the first movie turned over. Yes, A Dame to Kill For is still broken into chapters and shot in B/W with occasions flashes of color, and I loved the allusions to the previous film and comic books- however, in contrast to the rich character depth and storyline, the storyline(s) is flat, bland, and lacks the energy the dialogue contained in the previous film. Also, the storyline isn't remotely as interwoven as it was in the previous, the directors struggled to keep the chapters intertwined-the *only* connection being Kadie's Bar, which all of the characters visited at least once. I appreciated that Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller attempted to bring humor into the mix, but Marv's second, ""I hope you don't mind me saying this...."" scene really doesn't belong in the movie. This was my first review I hope you like it, I know it's not perfect, but these are my thoughts in a nutshell.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
255,bartlomiej-tyla,Bleak and boring,5,7 September 2014,"I loved the first Sin City, but I couldn't say one good thing about this movie. Stories were bleak and oversimplified. No twists, no memorable scenes. Visuals were not impressive either. Also I didn't really notice the part where Miho was badass, some random slashing with a sword, boring to me. 2 out 3 stories were like: 1. We've got a problem. 2. Marv raids a mansion. 3. Conclusion. The only story which did not match the schema above was the one with Levitt. While his character was likable (or maybe it was the actor), it seemed as if they did not really have an idea for him. For the amount of plot we got, I think this one should have been shorter by a half, then it might have been good.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
256,marvinjohnson-90-746217,Good Sequel,7,26 August 2014,"May contain spoiler!! At first I want to say that I am no professional review writer. I am here just to get something off my chest. It is the best sequel that I have ever seen. Very good plot and storyline, characters and actors, monologues and dialogues. The pace is a little bit off. The only thing that bothers me, no it basically boggles my mind is that there is one male black actor in the whole movie and there was no way getting around dropping the N-Bomb. When Marv beat up Manute they let to have him drop in my opinion unnecessary and unmodern line ""I always wanted to wrap my hands around one of these n*ggers"" I find this very sad, because my name is Marvin and I very much identified with the Mickey Rourke character, until that time. I didn't knew he was a racist. At least in the first part there were no racist remarks. But I thought that at least in this comic world people could and would get along without identifying others by the color of their skin, but I must have been wrong all of the way, as this example shows. Also we know now how Marv thinks about Gail aka Rosario Dawson when he encounters her, don't we? I find it sad and pathetic how in the year 2014 the scriptwriters still had to involve such immature language into the movie to pass on racism to our next generation. Also racism has a lot to do with inferiority complex and exactly this is what the scene screams out loud.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
257,march-09,Sin City 2: Little Bit of Disappointment,6,8 September 2014,"I chose this movie because I've seen the Sin City 1 before and I really like its story and the color that the movie used to enrich the emotion and the drama effect. In Sin City 2, color is still the most attractive part in it. About 90% of the scenes used the black and white color, so when the people who were polished in other colors, they would be emphasized. The audience would really want to know what would happen on those special characters. Sin City 2 focused much more on women. Following the Sin City 1, the main character Nancy tried to revenge for her beloved man. New character was added in, she was beautiful and smart, played the men's hearts to get what she want. One short story was about a man who was the son of the Sin City's Leader, but his identity is not admitted by his father as his mother is a whore. Although this movie is focused on women, I really like the story about the Leader's son. His identity is a private to other people, his mother was dead, even he won his father twice by poker, and his father angrily killed him and still not agree him as his son. Before his death, I thought it will spend more time to talk about him, but disappointingly, he was killed in a short time. Also, his lucky girl was killed too easy. She is not in B&W but in shiny blonde color. I would expect she will show more importance in the later drama, it's such a pity. More I want talk about is Nancy's part, I thought In Sin City 1, her story is completed in a sad but good ending, not use to talk more. Something good and still enlightened me is the passion, the force and the color adjustment of the movie. Overall, this is a good movie, but the story can be better.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For

The style of all his movies reveals this as it always includes plot twists and elaborate characters.It's the once-again beautifully picked cast including additions Ray Liotta, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Eva Green which turn the movie into a fantastic experience. Even Christopher Lloyd (Dr. Emmett Brown in ""Back To The Future"") appears - suitably as a doctor - and fits right into his role.Mickey Rourke is probably best at reprising his role as Marv, still causing trouble and fighting off enemies stronger than ever. Jessica Alba gives a strong performance reprising her role as Nancy Callahan and in my opinion plays the best female part aside from Eva Green.This movie is a signature Rodriguez film, very recommendable and has definitely earned accolades.",Sin City - A Dame to Kill For
262,lizziemoore2309,"For my tastes, I liked it.",7,21 October 2014,"I have a very strange taste in movies, so you're probably more likely to agree with the lower rated comments, but I really liked this movie. I'm no critic (I did one course in Film at university and wasn't particularly good at writing about films, even though my ideas were fairly solid - this is the first time I've attempted critiquing since then) so I apologize if it's a little basic. The plot of A Dame to Kill For isn't as well constructed as its predecessor. The problem is that it all feels like a collision, rather than the snapshot-like approach of Sin City. The continuation of the Hartigan/Callahan plot line helps (it's good to see Nancy's character FINALLY become more than a dancer... you took your time over it though, Miller!), but has been added in especially for the movie. I enjoyed this more than the Johnny storyline for exactly this reason. The gambling scenes felt almost shoehorned in, with no real background other than ""Oh, you're my illegitimate son."" *BANG* I know it's meant to show how ruthless and terrible Roark is, but it just felt too blunt, even for the style of the series. The central plot line is definitely the strongest, and has been suggested, having this, the Callahan story and the adventures of Marv as stand-alone short films could have augmented the graphic novel feel, reduced the shoehorning issue and helped to give more time and effort to the plot lines. I loved this film, mainly for the visuals. I really enjoy watching translations of books and graphic novels into movies, and with A Dame to Kill For, despite its construction flaws, it IS visually brilliant.

I enjoyed it personally; its just not that type of movie you would want to watch twice. The cast was awesome, it couldn't have been better. I guess it just needed some more of that Bruce Willis action! Oh and don't get me started on the girls from Old Town. The women selected for those roles were outstanding; intimidating yet sexy. Now I don't know about you guys, but this sequel has made me watch its predecessor just to see if I could put 2 and 2 together a little better.

Rodriguez worked on other projects which, in truth, were of special artistic value, or are they just an example of creativity high-aestheticism trash, but there were many, and should the toil. Second part, named after one of the stories, comes a few years too late, so that it is not the clearest intention why he had done, and why now. Maybe Rodriguez just socialized with Miller, perhaps this is his desperate attempt to return to the first league, though spent and out of ideas, and maybe only two of them decided to comply with the fans.
