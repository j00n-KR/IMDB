0,SnoopyStyle,never felt the love,7,28 November 2015,"It's 1922 Mexico City. Frida Kahlo (Salma Hayek) is a rebellious student who is intrigued with artist Diego Rivera (Alfred Molina). She is severely injured in a trolley accident and left bedridden with lifelong pains. She regains her ability to walk. Diego takes an interest in Frida's work. They get married and begin a passionate complicated relationship. She befriends his jealous ex Lupe Marín. He constantly cheats on her. Their son dies in childbirth. She starts having affairs with both men and women including communist icon Leon Trotsky.I really love the first hour. Her accident, her recovery and their courtship are all very compelling. Then the second half kind of move on and on and on. The problem is that he's such a slut. He never really demonstrates his love for her. I guess there is dependence or codependence. It's not that appealing. He's horrible and it doesn't put her in a great light either. It needs to illuminate her or her art more than what the movie gives.",Frida
1,claudio_carvalho,"The Story of a Great Mexican Artist, With a Stunning Performance of Salma Hayek",8,24 February 2004,"Frida Kahlo (Salma Hayek) is an tempestuous teenager, when  she suffers a bus accident in Mexico. Her column and leg have multiples fractures and she is impaled by a metal bar. Her father and mother spend all the money they have in surgeries and treatments, and in the end, also due to her will and strength, she walks again. Frida shows her paintings to the famous painter, intellectual and communist Diego Rivera (Alfred Molina) to criticize them. He finds them excellent and they become friend, lovers and get married to each other. Diego is very unfaithful to her and has many night stands with his models, but when he has an affair with Frida's sister Cristina, their marriage ends and they divorce. In the 30's, Leon Trotsky (Geoffrey Rush) gets political asylum in Mexico and is lodged with his wife in the house of Frida's parents. Frida and Trotsky have an affair, when Trotsky's wife ask him to move to another place. Rivera moves to USA and Frida has a gangrene in her toes. They are amputated and Frida gets worse and worse, using pain killers, steel jackets and other treatment. But she starts painting maybe her best pictures. Rivera comes back to Frida and gets married with her for the second time, and stays with her until her death. The story of this Mexican artist is wonderfully presented in this movie, with a stunning performance of Salma Hayek. Frida is showed as a great artist, revolutionary human being, having a great sexuality, feeling pain due to her accident, but having a great pleasure in life. All the cast and the direction are excellent. The theme song (`Burn It Blue'), from the Brazilian Caetano Veloso, is wonderful and won the Oscar. The make-up also won an Oscar. An excellent entertainment indicated for any audience. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): `Frida'",Frida
2,lee_eisenberg,She's still my favorite artist.,10,9 March 2006,"Salma Hayek does a perfect job playing Frida Kahlo. We see her tortured life and manage to feel it. Like ""Ray"" and ""Walk the Line"", this is a warts-and-all portrayal. Maybe the movie didn't go into her politics as it could have (her last public appearance was protesting against the CIA's overthrow of Guatemala's Pres. Jacobo Arbenz in 1954), but it did a really good job otherwise. ""Frida"" certainly deserved its Oscars for Makeup and Original Song. I think that Hayek should have gotten Best Actress. Also starring are Alfred Molina as Diego Rivera, Ashley Judd as Tina Modotti, Antonio Banderas as David Siquieros, Edward Norton as Nelson Rockefeller, and Geoffrey Rush as Leon Trotsky. A truly great movie.",Frida
3,jboothmillard,Frida,8,7 April 2007,"This is a very good biography mixing both the personal life and art work of a great Mexican artist and character. Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe Salma Hayek was the obvious choice to play Mexican (her true origin) painter Frida Kahlo who took the art world by storm with her self portraits, combining realism, symbolism and surrealism. But the personal life is much more the focus of this film, with her complicated relationship with womanising husband, cubist painter Diego Rivera (BAFTA nominated Alfred Molina), an illicit and controversial affair with Leon Trotsky (Geoffrey Rush), and being bisexual, many provocative and romantic entanglements with women. The use of Kahlo's artwork in the story is magnificent, the costumes are glamorous, the colours are lavish, and Hayek is fantastically gorgeous, especially in the nude (including the great lesbian romp), even with the unibrow/monobrow. It won the Oscars for Best Makeup, and Best Music, Original Score for Elliot Goldenthal, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, and Best Song for ""Burn It Blue"", it won the BAFTA for Best Make Up/Hair, and it was nominated for Best Costume Design, it won the Golden Globe for Best Original Score. Very good!",Frida
4,rmax304823,Salut.,6,29 May 2011,"I've only managed to see bits and pieces of this at irregular intervals but probably enough to form some reasonable observations.One is that there are three elements in the film and they get roughly equal time: the turbulent relationship between Frida Kahlo and the muralist Diego Rivera gets most of the attention; the success and frustrations that come along in the train of controversial art; and the politics of the cosmopolitan world of the 20s and 30s.The director does a fine job and is sometimes fairly innovative. You want to signal a passage of time or a radical change in location? The historical way of doing it would involve harp arpeggios, maybe a shivering dissolve, or pages fluttering from a calender. Here, the director, Julie Taymor, might take you through a perfectly apt collage of stills and paintings illustrating the new point in space and time.It took a little courage to cast Salma Hayek in the part of Frida. She's a sensual and attractive women, even with that penciled-in middle eyebrow over her glabella. But to surround the heroine with women as glamorous and sexy as Mia Maestro and Ashley Judd (who handles her Latin-American accent splendidly)? Good for them.The music by Elliot Goldenthal and the rest is memorable. The movie wouldn't be the same without it. So is the photography by Rodrigo Prieto. Modern photographers have developed an awful habit of using high contrast and casting the images in one or another designer variation of a ghoulish green. How nice to see a movie in which the chiles poblano don't look like avocados.For that matter, the art department deserves a bowl of guacamole the size of an Olympic swimming pool for capturing the period life of the bourgeoisie in Mexico City so convincingly. I can understand why the peons and haciendados might be grumbling and roiling but Frida and her friends and family? They suffer only the presence of long, groaning wooden tables covered with dishes of native Mexican food and internationally famous booze. Vast halls, spacious atria, potted tropical plants, surrounded by Olmec statues, sophisticated friends who bring you Marx and Schopenhauer if you're laid out in the hospital ""because you'll like it."" What a life. I think I'd have sat back and watched Ashley Judd and Salma Hayek tango all night if I could. Yes. Come to think of it, that was some tango.",Frida
5,ma-cortes,Splendid movie about two excellent Mexican painters and their troublesome relationship,7,5 May 2005,"The movie deals with the biography of Frida Kalho (well performed by Salma Hayek , though Laura San Giacomo was originally set to play her but was dropped when fans objected to a non-Mexican playing the role) who after a terrible accident with a trolley causes herself a crippling injury , then she gets away from her parents (Roger Rees and Patricia Spinola) to live on the paintings . She falls in love with famed muralist Diego Rivera (Alfred Molina , he gained 50 lbs , 23 kg , for this character) who bears a separated marriage (to Valeria Golino) . Later on , Frida is wedded to Diego and the troubles come out .The yarn relies heavily upon their tempestuous marriage , because the different artistic temperaments burst , creating a stormy relation . The picture is correctly based on historic deeds and even Edward Norton did an uncredited rewrite of the script . Thus , it appears Leon Trosky - who has romance to Frida- , but he's murdered with a hatchet by Ramon Mercader and then is framed Diego Rivera , though later being absolved . Besides , there are several famous people : Siqueiros (Antonio Banderas) , Nelson Rockefeller (Edward Norton) , Leon Trosky (Geoffrey Rush) and others very secondaries such as Andre Breton or Josephine Baker . Frida is specially known by her mustachioed and one-brow paintings and Rivera by his impressive murals and one of them was ordered to break by Nelson Rockefeller but reflected to famous communists on the ¨Rockefeller Center¨ . The film was perfectly directed by Julie Taymor and includes magnificent cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto as when imaginatively brings to life the scenes on the Kalho's paintings , where the color is glimmer and spellbound . The motion picture attained success and achieved enough box office , obtaining two Oscars for the awesome Musical Score (Elliot Goldenthal) and Make-up . Rating : Above average . Well Worth watching.",Frida
6,moonspinner55,"Surrealistic storybook presented in sweeping, romantic fashion...at the expense of the art",6,30 April 2009,"Mexican artist Frida Kahlo (1907-1954) painted self-portraits and surreal acts of God and madness like a woman possessed by a half-demon/half-angel; a book of her paintings is almost difficult to look through, as her singular sense of color (such as bloody crimson-reds and inky, staring blacks) and unflinching composition are violent, penetrating, twisted, and unnerving. Director Julie Taymor and actress-producer Salma Hayek's movie doesn't really get into the explosiveness of Kahlo's artistry, her rage, her desire to provoke--and no one on the screen comments on it, either. If it weren't for glimpses of Kahlo's artistic style, one might walk away from this film assuming she painted faces and flowers. Taymor is much more interested in the tumultuous love relationship between Kahlo and lusty, brazen, womanizing Communist painter Diego Rivera. Their shared passion for art may have gotten them into bed, yet her fiery need for pushing boundaries and his no-holds-barred take on revolutionary politics kept them together. This incredible partnership is expressed vividly, with wonderful performances by Hayek and Alfred Molina. Yet, the desire here should be to explore Frida's talents...what drove her to create such gut-wrenching works on the canvas? Did anyone recoil upon seeing them, or possibly object to the bloodletting she seemed to take such a morbid interest in? It's also disconcerting right from the start to hear everyone in the picture talking heavily-accented English in the midst of Mexico City, 1922. The presentation is indeed beautiful--maybe too beautiful--and the stormy marriage of the two artists is gripping; however, the real Frida Kahlo isn't out front--she's hovering on the edges of the film, peeking out at us once in awhile like a mad sprite. **1/2 from ****",Frida
7,Quinoa1984,Gives Salma Hayek a near oscar worthy performance,7,10 December 2002,"I can't determine how the Academy thinks in nomination standards (just look at Shakespeare in Love over Saving Private Ryan to see where they loose logic in the past), Hayek's role as Mexican artist Frida is definitely the best part of seeing the biopic on the woman.  The film tells her life story from school days to death, and is pitched up into occasional surreal country in the dramatic structure, or rather a sense of her art is incorporated into the storytelling, which is an impressive move on Taymor.  While I thought at times the overt drama had dips and peaks, the subject matter is of interest enough to reccomend it, and art admirers will get a good view not only of her paintings, but of her, as Hayek, in some brief, intoxicating sex scenes (first film since Desperado to have so).  Credit should also be given for the supporting cast, in particular Hayek's husband Molina and Rush's role as the communist exile.  B+",Frida
8,sunwarrior13,About A Mexican Painter,9,15 January 2012,"After being attached to a number of actors, directors, and producers, this long-gestating biography of one of Mexico's most prominent, iconoclastic painters reaches the screen under the guiding hand of producer/star Salma Hayek.Frida is a biographical film which depicts the professional and private life of the surrealist Mexican painter Frida Kahlo. It stars Hayek in her Academy Award nominated portrayal as Kahlo and Alfred Molina as her husband, Diego Rivera.The movie was adapted by Clancy Sigal, Diane Lake, Gregory Nava, Anna Thomas and Edward Norton from the book Frida: A Biography of Frida Kahlo by Hayden Herrera. It was directed by Julie Taymor.Hayek ages some 30 years on screen as she charts Frida Kahlo's life from feisty schoolgirl to Diego Rivera protégée to world-renowned artist in her own right. Frida details Kahlo's affluent upbringing in Mexico City, and her nurturing relationship with her traditional mother and philosophical father. Having already suffered the crippling effects of polio, Kahlo sustains further injuries when a city bus accident nearly ends her life. But in her bed-ridden state, the young artist produces dozens upon dozens of pieces; when she recovers, she presents them to the legendary -- and legendarily temperamental -- Rivera, who takes her under his wing as an artist, a political revolutionary, and, inevitably, a lover. But their relationship is fraught with trouble, as the philandering Rivera traverses the globe painting murals, and Kahlo languishes in obscurity, longing to make her mark on her own.Sporting mustache, Salma Hayek gives a solid performance in the otherwise conventional and mediocre biopic of the noted Spanish artist.Ms. Taymor also gets magnificent performance from Alfred Molina as the oversexed Diego Rivera.The film is passionate, provocative, hilarious, tragic and just dizzyingly beautiful to behold.But nevertheless,the screenplay's flatness ultimately defeats a film that's always a treat to look at.Taymor's only triumph is that her film, despite its distance from us in some ways, is pertinent and enthralling.",Frida
9,jotix100,Frida's art..,9,8 December 2002,"As film biographies go, this one is not as obnoxious as I thought it was going to be. Credit has to go to Julie Taymor for the treatment of the story of this unique painter who had such a horrible life. Thinking about possible castings, one can't imagine a lightweight such as Jennifer Lopez or anyone else as Frida. Salma Hayak brings the right amount of charm to make it work. Frida led such a horrendous life, what with the accident that crippled her, or her fixation with the painter Diego Rivera, who maybe was a genius, but in real life was a womanizer. Diego betrayed Frida constantly. Instead of turning away from him, Frida thrived in being dominated by him. She was a woman of contrasts.It's ironic that Frida dead is more famous that the struggling painter who led a precarious life and probably made very little from her art.",Frida
10,grantss,"Interesting, but not great",6,18 November 2015,"Interesting, but not great. Starts off very well, but after a while loses momentum and seems to drift. Considering the passion and spirit of the start, it might have been better to end the movie with Frida in middle age, rather than with her death.Good performances by Salma Hayek and Alfred Molina in the lead roles. Hayek shines, and gives the movie its initial momentum. All-star supporting cast: Geoffrey Rush (as Leon Trotsky), Ashley Judd, Edward Norton (as Nelson Rockefeller), Antonio Banderas, Saffron Burrows.",Frida
11,Calicodreamin,Beautifully made,8,10 July 2020,"A beautiful movie in many ways, amazing cinematography, the visual representation of the art, and the acting. The storyline is well developed and keeps a good pace throughout. Selma Hayek is amazing, the way she develops the character brings Fridas story to life.",Frida
12,evanston_dad,Paint By Numbers Biopic,6,4 August 2010,"I generally find biopics fairly boring, and ""Frida"" is no exception. Their makers always seem to think that an examination of the person will illuminate the art they produced, and they almost never do. Maybe because art comes from such a deep, personal place in each individual that a filmmaker can't get at the source.Salma Hayek is fine as Frida Kahlo, but it takes more than an artfully applied mono-brow to add up to a compelling performance. Alfred Molina does fine in the acting department, but honestly, Molina is so physically repellent in this movie that I found it difficult to tolerate him.Stage director Julie Taymor showed an uncharacteristic amount of restraint in bringing this story to the screen.Grade: B-",Frida
13,ferguson-6,Bravo! Salma,8,18 November 2002,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Salma Hayek brings to life the legend of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo.  An extraordinary performance that one can tell was very personal to Ms. Hayek.  Strange, but effective casting of Brit Alfred Molina (10 years after his most british role in ""Enchanted April""). Molina and Hayek capture this bizarre, yet touching relationship shared by Frida and Diego.  Valeria Golina (""Rainman"") and Geoffrey Rush (""Shine"") turn in nice performances as Diego's ex-wife and Leon Trotsky, respectively. A few near-cameos by Ashley Judd, Antonio Banderas and Ed Norton add a bit of Hollywood to a movie that manages to provide a historic touch to the spirited story of love, pain, loyalty, and personal strength.  Again, I say, Bravo Salma!",Frida
14,Sylviastel,I hope the exit is joyful and I hope never to return. - Frida,8,21 March 2018,"Salma Hayek played the Mexican artist, Frida Kahlo, in this two hour film about her life. Hayek played her perfectly as a complicated, sensual and determined woman. The film was directed by Julie Taymor who directed ""The Lion King"" musical on Broadway and around the world. The film is colorful, vibrant and alive with life. The cast included Alfred Molina as Diego Rivera, her husband, fellow artist and partner-in-life. British actor, Roger Rees, played her father. Australian actor, Geoffrey Rush, played Trotsky. Edward Norton played Nelson Rockefeller. Ashley Judd, Saffron Burrows, Antonio Banderas and Valeria Molino also are in the film. Salma did a wonderful job in playing Frida to earn an Academy Award nomination. The film was nominated for several Academy Awards. Composer Elliott Goldenthal won the Golden Globe Award and Academy Award for Original Score. A memorable scene is the sensual dance with Frida and another woman in the film. Her story and life was inspiring and admirable most of the time.",Frida
15,JamesHitchcock,"I have been faithful to thee, Frida! in my fashion",8,17 November 2019,"At the age of 18 the Mexican artist Frida Kahlo suffered serious injuries in a road accident. She survived, and made a partial recovery, but was in pain for the rest of her life and always walked with a limp. She was forced to give up her ambition to go to medical school and took up painting during her convalescence. The film starts with this accident and then follows Frida's artistic career and her private life, particularly her marriage to a fellow artist, the muralist Diego Rivera.Frida's relationship with Rivera was never an easy one as he was an inveterate womaniser, and marriage did nothing to moderate his sexual appetites. In the film we see Frida telling him that she expected his loyalty if not his fidelity. This phrase put me in mind of Ernest Dowson's protest (in ""Non Sum Qualis Eram"") that he had been faithful to his lover Cynara ""in my fashion"", but Frida was nevertheless able to turn Rivera's rather liberal interpretation of ""loyalty"" to her own advantage. It enabled her to take both male and female lovers- she was bisexual- with a clear conscience. In the film these lovers include Leon Trotsky during his exile in Mexico and Josephine Baker. At least, I presume that the black singer whom Frida meets in Paris is supposed to be Baker, although the cast list only names her as ""Parisian chanteuse"". (According to Salma Hayek, the explicit love scene between Frida and Josephine was included at the insistence of Harvey Weinstein as the price of his financial support for the project. Salma's experience of working with Weinstein does not appear to have been a happy one).Although Hayek, like Kahlo, is from Mexico, she was perhaps not the most obvious choice to play her. Hayek is Lebanese-Mexican whereas Kahlo was of German descent. If a Lebanese- American actress were to be cast as a German-American character, or vice-versa, it would certainly raise a few eyebrows, but that sort of political correctness does not seem to apply with as much force south of the Rio Grande as it does on its northern bank.Salma, one of the world's loveliest actresses, does not bear a great resemblance to Frida, who was, at best, belle-laide. The early 2000s saw an increase in cinematic uglification, with beautiful actresses like Charlize Theron (""Monster"") and Nicole Kidman (""The Hours"") hiding their beauty beneath their make-up, but here little attempt is made to alter Salma's looks. She represents her character by using Frida's trademark unibrow and centre parting as a sort of visual shorthand.Despite (or perhaps because of) their many arguments, and multiple infidelities on both sides, Frida's marriage to Rivera lasted for 25 years until her death in 1954, with one brief interruption. (They were divorced in 1939, but remarried a year later). Because Rivera was both a larger-than-life personality and a famous painter in his own right, this is to some extent a dual biography and a portrait of a marriage.The difficulty with dual biographies is that they require powerful performances from both leading actors, but fortunately director Julie Taymor is able to draw on precisely that from Hayek and from Alfred Molina. Molina's performance as Rivera, at the same time a genius, a Don Juan and something of a ruffian, is comparable in quality to the one he gave in the British drama ""Prick Up Your Ears"". In both films he portrays the life-partner of a real-life artistic figure, in that case Kenneth Halliwell, the lover of the playwright Joe Orton. Hayek has appeared in some rubbish, ""Wild, Wild West"" being a particularly egregious example, but here she is at her best. She might not look much like Frida Kahlo, but she portrays a brilliant, mercurial, courageous and passionate creative spirit to great effect. Unusually for a Hollywood movie this one does not attempt to play down the left-wing politics of its heroine and hero; both were avid supporters of the Mexican Communist Party and saw their artistic endeavours as inseparable from their political beliefs. (Rivera suffered the indignity of seeing the mural he had painted for the Rockefeller Center in New York destroyed when he offended his capitalist patrons by refusing to remove a portrait of Lenin).Although I am an art lover, I must admit that I am not familiar, except at second hand, with the works of either Kahlo or Rivera; Rivera's, for obvious reasons, are unable to travel outside Mexico, a country I have visited only once. This film, therefore, was something of an education for me, enlightening me about two artists I had previously taken only a passing interest in. 8/10",Frida
16,=G=,Uninspired and by the numbers,6,11 June 2003,"The biopic ""Frida"" leapfrogs through the highs and lows of the life of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo with a soap opera quality performance by Hayek, an uninspired screenplay and cinematography by rote, and an obvious lack of the passion which fueled the artist. For those unfamiliar with the title character, the subject will likely prove to be only marginally interesting. For those familiar with Kahlo, ""Frida"" will be a must see. Keep expectations low and you may be pleasantly surprised. (B-)",Frida
17,dromasca,best biography movie in years,9,13 August 2005,"Julie Taymor is not an usual director. Best known as director of 'Lion King' on Broadway, her filmography includes just a handful of works, best known before 'Frida' being 'Titus' - solid and challenging adaptation of the Shakespeare play, staring Anthony Hoppkins. With 'Frida' she engages in biography film, and the result is most unusual, different, but beautiful.Painter Frida Kahlo lived her life as a work of art. A talented and devoted artist and a left-winger, crippled since her young years, she mixed a life of suffering, creation, and passionate love for the great Mexican painter Diego Riviera. Director Julie Taymor plans the movie in a similar manner, a colorful creation, with astounding cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto, and with a soundtrack, song and dance scenes reminding the director background, but well-fit in the atmosphere of the film. Salma Hayek and Alfred Molina are superb in the leading roles, true to the spirit and close to the image of the original heroes. The only weaker part of the movie lies in some weaker secondary role, Geoffrey Rush is not convincing at all in Totsky's role, and there is no chemistry between him and Hayek to justify the relationship despite the difference in age.One of the best biography movies in years, maybe the best.",Frida
18,Irishchatter,Taught me a lot more of who Frida was as a person!,8,14 May 2017,"I have to say, this movie was very well done with Salma Hayek playing as the Mexican uni-brow artist Frida. Before watching this movie, I never heard of Frida but all my life, I've seen the painting she did of herself. Now in 2017, I finally got the chance to find out more about Frida and the story behind the paintings she did while she was alive. Honestly, she died so very young at 47 and it was so sad in the end of this movie, she wasn't able to get out of bed. At least she got to see her exhibition and be able to chat to people before her passing. The bus accident didn't really help her poor body and I suppose the surgeries then weren't as effective as they are now. Salma Hayek was the perfect actress to be playing as Frida and she even looked like her! One of the best roles shes ever done hands down!",Frida
19,Bored_Dragon,Very unusual movie experience,7,13 July 2018,"Very unusual movie experienceThis strange art-drama is an adaptation of the biography of famous Mexican artist Frida Kahlo. On the story itself I have no objections, but it did not leave a particularly strong impression on me either. But the performance of Salma Hayek and the way in which the movie was filmed are truly impressive. The camera, directing and editing are very unusual and interesting, especially the way in which the animation is integrated (Frida's paintings coming to life and the surreal scenes that illustrate Frida's states of mind), as well as excellent music.7,5/10",Frida
20,tabuno,One of the Best Movies of the Year,9,27 January 2019,"17 November 2002. Salma Hayek has created an amazing artistical brilliant and well-portrayed, triumphant motion picture of two major artists from the Latino world. Well acted, capturing the true sense of place and time, of love and affairs, for social movements, and emotional pain and happiness. This is a solid movie that is a must see for anyone who believes in the artistic expression of the internal world as exploding onto the screen by Frida Kahlo to the political commitment and expression of Diego Rivera - the dove and the elephant, an evolving tale of romance and independence, of sensual freedom and betrayal.",Frida
21,Thanos_Alfie,The Mexican artist...,7,10 March 2018,"""Frida"" is a biography movie in which we follow the life of the artist Frida Kalho. From her painful injury to her marriage with Diego Rivera and from her extraordinary - weird for that time relationship with her husband to her controversial affair with Leon Trotsky and back to her relationship with Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo lived her life to maximum at the point she could. We watch her life as a political, artistic, and sexual revolutionary as it was also in real life.I liked this movie because it was a biography of a very important person in Mexico who influenced a lot of people all over the world and not only artists. She was a woman with a lot of guts or 'cojones' as it was mentioned in the movie. This can be easily understood by her behavior and of course her character. I liked very much the interpretations of Salma Hayek who played as Frida Kahlo, Alfred Molina who played as Diego Rivera and Valeria Golino who played as Lupe Marín. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned are Geoffrey Rush who played as Leon Trotsky and Mía Maestro's who played Cristina Kahlo. The direction which was made by Julie Taymor was simply magnificent. The only drawback or a recommendation that I have is that there were not so many chronological information about Frida. In some scenes, it would be good to exist a date that states when the couple or just her moved to another country or when something changed their lives. Finally, I have to say that ""Frida"" is a very good movie, interesting and with a beautiful combination of romance, art, and true fight for everything. In addition to this, I believe that it can teach us many things not only from their artistic perspective but also from the perspective of life by itself. It's a lesson of life for everyone, to understand how important are some simple things in our own lives and that sometimes we have to put our ego aside for a purpose or even a person. I strongly recommend this movie to everyone, I believe you are going to learn and earn many things from it.",Frida
22,Red-125,"""Paint by Numbers""",8,15 December 2002,"""Frida"" is worth seeing because it is one of the few movies about a woman painter.  (""Artemisia"" was about a woman painter, but had very little validity in regard to Artemisia Gentileschi's life or art.)Go to this movie expecting a good film, but don't go to this movie expecting a masterpiece.  Salma Hayek is wonderful as Frida, and Alfred Molina does well as her husband, Diego Rivera.  I found the other characters two-dimensional.It is true that a director is constrained when doing a biography.  Even so, I had the sense that the director had a list of interesting/important episodes in Frida Kahlo's life, and was counting these episodes off as she made the film:""This is the scene where Frida meets Diego Rivera."" ""This is the scene where Frida goes to Paris,"" etc.My wife put it best--""I never got the sense that I was in Frida Kahlo's life.  I spent two hours on the outside, looking in.""Nonetheless, this film presents a colorful, music- filled two-hour biography, with two strong leads. There are worse ways to spend an afternoon at the movies!",Frida
23,meeza,Hayek & Molina are the true artists in this one,7,26 December 2002,"There were some critics, including me, that would yell ""hay"" ""hay"" ""hayek"" on the thought of Salma Hayek acting in an another film.  I have not been impressed with Salma's body of work, even though I have been quite impressed with Salma's body. When I read that critics were pleasantly surprised with her performance as mexican artist Frida Kahlo in the bio flick ""Frida"", I thought those critics were ""frida fried"". However, once I experienced ""Frida"" I must say that Salmita remained herself ""calmita"" over the years in waiting for the applicable part for her; because ""Frida"" is it. Hayek bears her soul in executing her finest performance, even though that is not a stretch (sorry Salmita). Guys, let me not forgot to mention that she bears a few other things besides her soul, which might be a bit entertaining to witness. The artist Frida Kahlo lived a very convoluted life filled with a crippling injury, a womanizing communist husband, and a melancholy artistic mindset. If Frida were alive today, let's just say she would be the ""guinea pig"" of most of the untested antidepressant medications.  Alfred Molina is exhilarating as the artistic adulterous hubby (yea! I know ""artistic & adulterous"" is an oxymoron, but it is ironic because his character was quite a moron himself.) Aspects of the film that did not ""drew"" me in to ""Frida"" were: the cliché-filled screenplay, the overexposed symbolic direction, and the irrelevant star-studded cameos. However, I do recommend ""Frida"" because of Hayek & Molina's ""artistic representation"" of artists.*** Average",Frida
24,smatysia,Decent biopic; badly over-directed,7,14 October 2003,"Okay, I'd barely (if at all) heard of Frida Kahlo before hearing about this film. From what I saw in the movie, I don't really care that much for her art. (or Rivera's either for that matter) But the biographical (or hagiographical) part of the film was interesting and entertaining. Salma Hayek was remarkable. (and beautiful) But there were way too many cute little surreal sequences and other directorial excesses. This distracted from the film. I suppose it was supposed to evoke the ""magical realism"" in vogue in Latin American (and some other) writing. I read one of Gabriel Garcia Marquez' books, and the style really isn't any better on the page than it is on the screen. One side note: Weren't people able to see the monstrous evil that was/is Communism, without having to wait for the tens of millions of corpses to pile up? Oh, well, I guess some people STILL don't see it.Overall, I recommend this movie, even to those who know or care little about Kahlo or Rivera. Grade: B-",Frida

There's a line in the film where Kahlo says, 'at the end of the day, we can all endure much more than we think we can.' and I think this one line resumes everything about her...Salma Hayek proves herself that she's more than just another pretty face... Salma is full of vigor as the angry strong-willed female artist caught in a net of pain... It's pleasing to see Hayek in a production where she is totally confidant, sexy and lusty in an uncomplicated way... Salma captures the spirit of Frida and plays it with heart and style, longing for the healing touch... She dances a provocative tango with Ashley Judd, and goes to Paris to explore her bisexual side...The chemistry between Salma and Molina is terrific... Her passion for art is overtaken by her passion for him... She expresses her emotions by teasing him, by playing practical jokes, by exciting the jealousy of his wonderful wife, Lupe Marin (Valeria Golino).But Frida remains in Rivera's shadow... She calls herself ""a charming amateur."" She focuses on her expressive self portraits of her physical pain, anger, and disappointment... Yet while viewers are left with the impression that there is undoubtedly more to Frida's life than what appears on screen, what we get instead is a love story, a tale of Frida's romantic, and tempestuous union to the unfaithful husband she marries twice and never stopped to love...London-born actor Alfred Molina is absolutely splendid as the lovable Rivera... He is a well-known womanizer who can never be faithful to any woman... Diego is a painter of conviction... A revolutionary painter who believes in Frida's anguished brush, and championed her work... He decides to create paintings which would speak directly to the common people...In a motion picture that sweeps from the late 1920s into the 1950s, Julie Taymor proves to be a director of taste and sensitivity... She captures the mood of the moment with genuine flair and style... Her imagery is exciting, and we are convinced that we are seeing Mexico in the first half of the 1900s, with its native markets, textiles, music, and food... Julie Taymor infuses it with elements of Frida's artistic creativity, bringing much of her work to life... Her film was nominated for six Academy Awards...Vague references to the political struggle between Trotsky and Stalin make their way into the script... The film ignores Siqueiros' central role in the unsuccessful attempt on Trotsky's life in 1940... But the motion picture details the mistake of Nelson Rockefeller commissioning Rivera a huge fresco for his public hall...",Frida
26,noralee,"Stunning Looking, Beautiful Sounding Hollywood Bio Pic",7,7 December 2005,"I've read that Salma Hayek was inspired to produce and star in ""Frida"" through a challenge from Russell Crowe, her co-star from ""Breaking Up,"" who criticized her for making lousy movies and pushed her to make a significant one. And there is certainly a similarity between Frida and Crowe's own ""A Beautiful Mind"": it's a glossy Hollywood bio pic with some imaginative flair. Hayek persisted in getting the movie made to have a Mexican feminist icon played by a Mexican actress -- though she saw no similar national loyalty in casting the rest of the characters, including Alfred Molina as Diego Rivera, Valeria Golino as Lupe Marín, etc.Hayek is effective in aging from a rebellious teenager to a tragic revolutionary, though her evocation of Kahlo's life of pain wavers a lot, including that sometimes she limps, sometimes she doesn't.But the key is the opening credit: ""A film by Julie Taymor"" and this makes is worth seeing. The lush art direction vibrantly uses Kahlo's colors and the creative visual interpretations of Kahlo's life and paintings communicate far more about the artist's life (particularly her inner life) than any of the acting. I do feel I finally have a good handle on Kahlo's surrealistic work and an understanding of her obsessive self-portraits that I didn't have before. The collages and animation are simply marvelous; there aren't nearly enough use of them.The music only began to come to life in the second half, as we got less of Taymor's partner's Eliot Goldenthal's music and more Latino songs, particularly in a startling serenade by a genuine ex-cohort of Khalo's Chavela Vargas that is like a similar scene in ""Mulholland Drive.""The production notes at the film's official Web site give interesting musical and location information.

27,rbverhoef,"Looks very good, with great performances",8,2 August 2003,"'Frida' is a good movie although it felt a little long. Some events were included but were not really necessary in the story of the life from Frida Kahlo, the famous painter from Mexico. Frida is played by Salma Hayek and she gives a great performance and makes us care for the artist she portrays. The man she weds is another great Mexican painter, Diego Rivera, played by Alfed Molina. He as well gives a fine and believable performance.The whole movie looks beautiful with a great art direction and set decoration, a fine cinematography and a good direction. The score by Elliot Goldenthal adds a lot to the whole atmosphere of the movie. We have some nice cameos from Antonio Banderas, Edward Norton, Geoffrey Rush and especially Ashley Judd. All this makes 'Frida' a very good movie. Possibly it could be better, but thinking about the difficult material is is very well done.",Frida
28,rosscinema,Hayek and Molina shine,7,24 November 2002,"I found Frida to be a pretty well made film as far as acting and set designs and the paintings but the film does lack something. One thing I do not hear enough of is why wasn't this filmed in spanish? It should have. The fact that it wasn't tells me the all american dollar was in the thoughts of Julie Taymor and Salma Hayek and I think its a big flaw. Secondly, Frida is portrayed in a very nice way and I think we all know nobody's that perfect! From what I hear, Frida had her share of character flaws that were not portrayed in the film. But what the film does best I think is capture the tough spirit of this woman who really did live a life of pain. Her spirit is captured and it shines throughout the film. This is the first film where Hayek's shortness is very evident. She's maybe 5'1"" and her tiny stature is interesting to watch. Hayek is also naked in this film but its not exploitive, its necessary to the story. Hayek is good in the film and she helps capture the spirit of Frida and I also think Alfred Molina really shines in his role. I predict both will receive Oscar nominations. Of all the recognizable names in the credits I was surprised to see Didi Conn of ""Grease"" as a waitress. She's an extra! Who's her agent? And Ashley Judd didn't really convince anyone with her accent. Not a great film but it is well made and acted and the set designs are terrific. But it should have been filmed in Spanish!",Frida
29,nycritic,"Her Life, Her Art, Her Beating, Terrific Heart: A Woman Named Frida",10,16 March 2006,"Thank God for a life filled with tragedy. Thank God for a life filled with pain, with loss, with petty betrayals leading to a reaffirmation of love and bonds of similar minds; thank God for a woman who was not a victim of events or a wilting flower once the real pain set in but a fierce fighter able to process the horror within her life and transmute it into stark portrayals of mutilated beauty.And on this note, thank God for people like Salma Hayek, Alfred Molina, Julie Taymor, and the brothers Quay. In order to successfully talk about FRIDA as a whole, one has to mention all of these people in tandem since as a unit they have created a true work of art about an artist whose art was intense, brooding, at times alienating, but evocative. Without Alfred there would be no Diego Rivera depicted with all his peccadilloes but deeply attached by a lifeline to Frida, her mirror image. Without Salma, there would be no real Frida -- she is Frida from the inside out, through her most cocky to her most ravaged self.Taymor sheds any trace of Disney sensibility and brings forth a unique picture which in artistic terms, as a painting, would be considered mixed media. If COMO AGUA PARA EL CHOCOLATE failed to bring forth the essence of magic realism, FRIDA wallows in it in almost every scene depicting Frida Kahlo's inner world in relations to a specific moment. For example, a trolley accident which shattered her body (already having been afflicted with polio) is depicted in exact terms of magic realism: a blue bird flying out of her hands at the moment of impact, then showing us her battered body under rubble, blood, and the gold dust she was only moments ago admiring from a vendor. She has become her own work of art, so entrenched in death. Her recovery is equally stunning, seen in stop-motion animation as doctors and nurses administer her prognosis. Yet another scene, Frida and Diego Rivera's wedding, is seen through a close shot of a painting which morphs seamlessly into the actual event. As a matter of fact, her art is seen woven into the fabric of the film -- since this biopic is about her life (and on a secondary note, Diego Rivera's) it's only fitting that even in elements that do not include her -- as in the assassination of Leon Trotsky.Frida was an extraordinary woman who left her mark in a lifespan which by today's standards seems short, but in her comes across as well-lived. Her stormy affair with Rivera is the stuff of two people well-matched move for move. She had his affairs; she had hers and pursued them even in his face. The only point in which I differ in opinion is the one when Rivera fights for his artistic integrity (which is really vanity masked in quasi-politics) but it serves to portray him as a fallen Kong being trampled by the New World in an irony of visual storytelling. Which of course, Frida was so keen in representing on canvas.",Frida
30,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,An interesting look at the life of the famous artist,8,31 March 2019,"It truly is an odd sight to get to understand the history of someone's life of someone so famous. It is the public perception that all famous individuals live a life of luxury and no concerns. It is far from truth because many artists have similar issues and sometimes in larger volumes. Frida, a Mexican artist who is known for her work is celebrated by many and yet her back story of how she became what she's known for is so saddening. Being an artist is not always an easy thing like it is portrayed to be. But the crew involved with making the biopic of this Latin American woman really put in the time to make this film as good as it is. It still has an issue but not compared to the rest of its strengths.Basically covering Frida's view of life before and after her turning point accident, the script has lots of great details to cover. It's surprising too when looking at who helped write the script. Clancy Sigal and Diane Lake are two of the four involved who had no history before or after working on major films. This usually hits a red flag. However, the other two, Anna Thomas and Gregory Nava had worked on projects and the fact they were able to all put it together deserves applause. Julie Taymor serves as director to this feature, which is also rare recalling how many female directors were around. A few years before Taymor also directed Titus (1999), which received strong reviews too.The cast of actors hired to play their parts do a great job at diving into their roles. Salma Hayek as Frida very much captures the essence of the artist in multiple ways. From the visual look, actions and dialog. Viewers will really sympathize with her role seeing the kind of roller coaster her life becomes. Playing her right hand man (literally) is Alfred Molina as Diego Rivera, Frida's real life on and off lover. Not only does Molina show what kind of person Diego Rivera was, but viewers may also sympathize with him too as wildly unpredictable he ends up being. Both Molina and Hayek have great chemistry together and display it well on scene. There's one part to them that doesn't get much clarity though.Character motives seem a little out of place at times. This occurs mostly for the two leads, but it also happens with some other supporting characters. Not much detail is given so it doesn't make a lot of sense as to why a certain character will make a decision on something. It's almost like it was impulse only. However, the supporting actors are great to watch too. Frida's father Guillermo (Roger Rees) plays a likable parent for his open mindedness. Valeria Golino plays an ex-wife of Diego Rivera and even talks to Frida about various topics. Golino was also in Rain Man (1988) and Escape from L.A. (1996). There's also appearances by Edward Norton, Ashley Judd, Mía Maestro and Geoffrey Rush.The visual look of the film is also well done. Shot by Rodrigo Prieto, a native to Mexico, handles the cinematography. The film contains much of what Mexico looks like including some very old architecture. There's even a stop motion animated scene that reminisces to that of something Tim Burton or Tom Sellick would like. The music is also another well accomplished component. Featuring a mixture of Latin singers and a score by Elliot Goldenthal, the soundtrack to this picture is elegantly structured in a way that really flows well. Goldenthal's transition cues blend nicely with the scenes until the Latin singers take over. All in all very well represented.Watching this film will show fans of the artist the kinds of issues Frida had to deal with on a frequent basis. With the right actors, music, writing and visuals, viewers will come out knowing what kind of tough cookie she was.",Frida
31,JuguAbraham,Another masterpiece from Julie Taymor,8,11 March 2004,"Not surprisingly most critics zoom in on Salma Hayek's performance, the sets, the make-up, and the music in case they are not taken in by the real spunky nonconformist life of the lead character.However, I applaud the person never seen in the movie--the director Julie Taymor. I had seen her previous film ""Titus"" and therefore the maturity of her work this film unfolded was not altogether unexpected.It was not surprising that she was totally in control of the rich script, astute casting (Saffron Burrows as Gracie, Ashley Judd as an Italian in Mexico, Edward Norton as Rockefeller, etc., apart from the major roles), great special effects and rich factoids (""Edward G Robinson owns most of her work""). Every scene is well thought out and captured imaginatively. Even her use of the King Kong footage, though not well researched, was fascinating. The comments on France, USA (""gringoland""), Mexico, the former USSR are not overstated, just alluded to and can be picked up by keen viewers. Taymor presents a visual and intellectual mosaic that can be savoured by some, missed by others. There is humour in the dialogue--the vows taken by Diego and Frida before they enter Diego's house the first time--and there is tragedy ""I want you to leave before I finish drawing this butterfly.""The finest words are the lyrics of Taymor in the theme song set to music by Elliot Rosenthal. Ashley Judd and Antonio Banderas have short screen time but are effective in their minor roles. Valeria Golino as Lupe was impressive.Taynor's work of merging live scenes with Frida's paintings stand out. The editing and photography in these sequences are really commendable.The film was rich in every department and I am happy that Taymor, not acknowledged by Hollywood as yet, was given an award at Venice Film Festival for this film. Europe seems to acknowledge the better American directors such as Terrence Malick, Hitchcock, Jerry Schatzberg, Robert Altman, to name a few. ""Titus"" remains Taymor's finest work--I look forward to more from her.",Frida
32,stensson,Why do they speak English,6,26 December 2002,"It's difficult to understand this contempt for English-spoken audiences. Is it supposed that they are unable to read subtitles? Everybody speaks English with a hispanic accent here, even in Mexican workers' bars.
Salma Hayek is a talented actress, but this is not her best part. There are to little complications here, which is much due to the script. Frida is mostly the living loving soft-hearted girl, who gets into two accidents or as she puts it out: the tram and the husband. We don't get to understand much of her art, although many paintings are shown. What was Frida trying to say? She has a miscarriage and paints that for example, but what does all the symbols in her paintings mean?Alfred Molina is all right as her always cheating husband. Edward Norton rather lousy as the young Rockefeller. Antonio Banderas is seen in a smaller part. This picture might be regarded as an intellectual mainstream film, but it is definitely more mainstream than intellectual. And please, speak Spanish while in Mexico!",Frida
33,valadas,Love and pain,8,10 June 2009,"This is above all the story of the painful love that for 26 long years united the great Mexican painter Frida Kahlo (1907 - 1954) to the no less great painter Diego Rivera, a period full of alternate moments of great tenderness and fierce quarrels and punctuated by periods of separation and inclusive a divorce followed by a second marriage because their love was so strong that they couldn't live without each other despite the constant Rivera's infidelities since he was a compulsive philanderer about which he nevertheless and very loyally warned Frida in the moment they decided to get married. The movie is very true in biographical general terms except maybe for small details here and there. Salma Hayek has a great performance as Frida showing us the strong character of that courageous woman who through most of her life endured great physical suffering since she was victim of a serious accident involving a tramway where she travel-led when she was still a student which left her with serious sequels for the rest of her life. She also had no less than 3 miscarriages. All these physical and moral sufferings never depressed her and she went on painting and transposing to his paintings in a symbolic way those sufferings of hers. When she was already very sick and her doctor had forbidden her to leave her bed she appeared at the inauguration of the first exhibition of her works lying down in bed. All this is shown in the movie with great fidelity, efficiency and sentimental strength. The last part of the movie is particularly poignant though in a gentle way using sometimes the symbolism of mixing softly images of the real Frida with self-portraits on her paintings. A very well made movie from both aspects of form and content.",Frida
34,KUAlum26,Can't say I fell in love with this movie but...,7,29 March 2007,"...there's a lot I came away liking in it.Frida follows most of the life story of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo(SAlma Hayek,who pushed hard for this show,produced it and her passion for it shows in this role!),from her days as an Art school student in 1922 to her dying days in the(I'm guess-timating here)late 1960s. THrough it all,she goes from being a carefree student head-over-heels for a boy--a fellow student--as she suffers from severe spinal injuries from a trolley accident,to an active Communist with her mentor,friend,lover and eventual husband(twice)famed artist Diego Riviera(Alfred Molina,reliable and versatile),who promotes her career but also ends up cheating on her at least twice and gets introduced into the world of Marxist personalities,among them a fugitive Leon Trotsky(Geoffrey Rush). Through it all,she paints the world she knows and steadily: her joys,her pains(i.e. Diego's infidelity,her miscarriage,her disabilities and failing health)and much of what she observes in her travels.Beautifully filmed by director Julie Taymor,off an adapted novel,and featuring extended cameos by Ashley Judd and Edward Norton and augmented by touching performances by Roger Rees(as Frida's patient and loving father),Valeria Golino(as one of Diego's former wives)and Mia Maestro as Frida's sister,this movie is colorful,lush and passionate. I suppose maybe the whole ""political passion"" element of the show was somewhat lost on me,a late 20th century/early 21st century American,who did not grow up in an era when Socialism could capture a sense of liberation or constructive change. Also,the arty direction of the film changes narrative direction just enough to confuse or disorientate. Still,all in all,worth a look and a film that is effective in--if nothing else--getting you to feel it5s passion.",Frida
35,PatrynXX,Filmakers forgot what they were filming.,6,6 August 2003,"(spoilers)The movie is about Frida yes?  Then why give her second billing?  We learn alot about Diego, but nothing much from Frida.  Sure it tells us that she was in pain, but you don't get to know that much until later in the movie. She seemed to take it better than Gloria Estafan.  Totally absurd.  I'm sure some of our males mouths dropped when Salma's cast was taken off and we get to see a powdered chest, but shouldn't we be getting back to Frida now?  The music is fairly on track, the cinematography was excellent, but the story is lacking in it's core figure.  I came away with a sense of ""did I miss something?""  It really doesn't get into much of her drug abuse either.  Sure she loved alcohol, but what drugs did she abuse?Another thing I noticed,  it was difficult to tell when it was America and when it was Mexico.  Whats Geoffery Rush doing in this?  he was a bit of a laugh though. ;) Wait a minute, whats Antonio Banderas in this?

36,jaredmobarak,Alone in painFrida,8,23 June 2007,"I've said it many times; I am not a fan of biopics. They always overextend themselves to the point of unbelievability because of the same actors playing everyone from 20-80 years old. The ones that work are those that take a slice of life rather than the entirety of it, like The Queen and Capote. Let's say I was very surprised to find out how much I enjoyed Frida. From her college years until her death, this film never feels like we are learning about her lifeit never seems like a history lesson. Instead we are treated with a story of love and love lost, a tale that intrigues on a literary level rather than an, ""oh that's what her life was like"" one. Much of this success, I'm sure, is due to the stunning visual imagery utilized by director Julie Taymor. She has taken this story and infused it with her own imagination and interpretations of Frida Kahlo's work and has created a piece of art herself. At the end you don't think how now you know Frida's life; what you say is that you know her work and the emotional turmoil needed to create it.Kahlo was a woman in love while also scorned by it, along with fate, throughout her life. She faced love's hurt as well as the physical pain of accidents and a crippled body. The real trouble though, was that through it all, she was always full of joy and happiness and a willingness to give it to those around her. Just by looking at her artwork, I always assumed Kahlo was a woman in pain, showing her suffering on the canvas. However, if this film is true, she was full of life and optimism. No matter what was thrown her way, she never let it get to her. If anything, this helps me understand her paintings even more now. Her body failed her and she allowed her canvases to become vessels for her soul.This film would be nothing without the performances of Salma Hayek and Alfred Molina. Molina has always been a favorite of mine, but after this role I am even more impressed. The way he channels the aggression mixed with compassion is impressive. His exterior can be menacing and his ideals can bring up an unmatched anger, but at the end of the day Diego Rivera is a man led along by love. If he could never stop the infidelity, he still could unequivocally love his wife. Frida was the one woman that kept him going. The many chapters in their relationship had pain involved, but their connection to each other always won out. As for Hayek, I have never seen anything special come from her. After this, though, I can say she truly deserved the Oscar nomination. Fully encompassing the artist, any preconceptions of her as an actress are thrown out the window. She is Frida Kahlo for the duration and you never question her authenticity or emotion. Working through the pain of life, Hayek displays how a strong will can help battle God's numerous follies set forth for you.Both leads have career performances here, but the rest of the cast isn't too bad either. Besides Taymor's artistic prowess, gaining her start after directing the Broadway production of The Lion King, she seems to have the star power draw. Ashley Judd, Edward Norton, Antonio Banderas, and Geoffrey Rush are just a few of the big name cameos seen throughout. None of them have too big of a role and all of them complement the stars perfectly. The best supporting player, however, is the artistry on display. Sure there are some gorgeous transitions between some scenes, and wonderful montages of collaged still work and filmed motion, (the arrival to NYC), but the real masterpiece lies in the living paintings. The use of this trick, showing a Kahlo work whose subjects come to life, is phenomenal to behold. Not only visually stunning, this gimmick helps show the parallel of her canvas to her true self. The body holding her ideals and thoughts on earth was not it. Kahlo put pieces of her inner being on display each time she worked. The way this little maneuver worked here has only made me feel more excited for Taymor's next film Across the Universe, and has whet my appetite to seek out Titus to see what this visionary has done and think of what she could do in the future.",Frida
37,marcin_kukuczka,"Controversial Biopic about the Life of ""Secular Saint""",5,27 November 2007,"Exotic views of cacti, peacocks walking proudly, range of colors, streets filled with Latino music and a bed carried with pillows on which one can notice an inscription ""AMOR"" and the face of a suffering woman. It's Frida Kahlo, a Mexican painter whose art is ""lovable as a smile"" for some people and ""cruel as bitterness of life"" for others. Yet, there are also those who consider her persona and work highly overrated. The same, I think, may be said about the movie.Being based on the novel by Hayden Herrera, directed by Julie Taymor and co-produced by Salma Hayek who is cast in the lead, it's a tribute to the artist that appears to be so politically correct nowadays that some people are emotionally overwhelmed by the sound of the name alone, Frida. Nowadays, her persona is not only popular but admiration of hers borders on idolatry. She was a woman, a wife, a lesbian, an artist, a socialist: how many values one can carry? Yet, what good comes out of these very values? The film is, like Frida's life, a perfect contradiction! In what sense? On the one hand, we get scenes that are deeply attached to traditional viewpoint about family relations, sincerity in man-woman relationship, motherly love, society and politics, personal freedom and dignity. Those are mostly expressed in Frida-Diego marriage that she so much desires to base on honesty, love and respect. She is pregnant and sincerely wants to have a child; however, her fate appears to be less merciful. This viewpoint is also resembled in the treatment of beauty that is so crucial in any sort of art. On the other hand, we get obscene moments of vulgarity, swear words, decadence, nudity, and humiliation of humanity in general. Because how is it possible to remain positive towards the scenes of sexuality presented purely as animal magnetism. Not a sexual desire presented with a sense of art but with a sense of vulgarism. The script intensifies this aspect, just to mention a tasteless conversation about girls with b**** and men with t***. I also disliked the weird scenes of Frida's operation and those odd bones, sounds that would appeal to a teenage viewer perhaps. The idea of marital treason is perceived as something that does not carry serious consequences. Partly, Frida disagrees with that saying outrageously ""Now I don't know who f**** whom in my house"" but in the final conclusion, it was just normal and forgivable for Diego and for Frida a comfortable path towards revenge.Since the figure of Frida is still not famous in my country, my friends recommended me to see this movie for the sake of Mexico rather than the artist. Although I love the Mexican culture and am very much interested in the past of this beautiful country, I don't think that FRIDA is a movie where you will absolutely get a cultural insight. However, let me find some positive points about the movie. I admit that, in this case, there are two very nice elements in the movie that raised my interest and helped me digest the rest which was sometimes not worthy attention. The first most important aspect is the wonderful music that can be admired throughout in the form of songs and tunes. There is the Mexican Soul which is a great plus for the movie (difficult to imagine there weren't). In this respect, what touched me most was the song near the end ""Viva La Vida."" Another great advantage is the variety of colors and very subtle moments that address the visual admiration. I loved the sequence with Trotsky and not for its political aspect but for the stunning scene among cacti on the pyramid at Teotihuacán where the sun shines in a different manner, in the Mexican manner. So this visual splendor and music make the film worth seeking out.But when we may analyze the movie as for the flawless aspects, there is one that many people will surely accept: performances. I may detest the movie for the aforementioned aspects of simplified values, vulgarity, idolatry, but Salma Hayek and Alfred Molina really feel their roles and fit to them in each respect. Although Madonna and Jenifer Lopez strove for the leading role in the movie, Hayek occurs to be the best choice. A dove marries an elephant but what dove and what elephant! She portrays a woman absorbed by two passions: pain and art; he portrays a man absorbed by one passion filled with two desires: art filled with sex and politics. She hates complements and he loves women. She suffers and he has a good time. Finally, however, he offers her a moving tribute before a big audience just before her exit. Hayek as a woman of imagination and Molina as a man of magnetism for women are fine in their parts. The supporting cast are absolutely in the shadow of the couple.FRIDA, the movie... Controversial? Yes. Beautiful? In a sense. Artistic? In some parts. Political? Indirectly. Interesting content? Not really. Yet, one thing is crucial: FRIDA is a true biopic, a movie made by people who really care about her popularity, who really care about the idolatry of a ""secular saint"". 5/10",Frida
38,aciessi,Her Story.,8,13 July 2020,"Frida is a biopic, as decadent and beautiful as the art of Frida Kahlo. I can't imagine how you could make it any other way. Yes, we follow Frida through her dysfunctional and broken relationship with both Diego Rivera and the international socialist movement. But the way this story is told is key. The editing and cinematography pays enormous tribute to Frida's paintings and the genre of art that she represents. Salma Hayek is tremendous as Frida. Alfred Molina is tremendous as Diego. It's thoroughly exquisite.",Frida
39,gbheron,Selma and Julie Overextend,7,10 July 2003,"Frida is a labor of love for Selma Hayak, and it shows in her heartfelt performance. She portrays the famous Mexican painter Frida Kahlo, from her adolescence through late middle-age, and everything in between. What a life Frida led; wife to Diego Garcia, lover to others of both sexes including an elderly Leon Trotsky. Drinking, fighting, painting, and loving with the best of them.  Hayak and Alfred Molina are very good and totally believable in their portrayals of Frida and Diego and their stormy relationship. Geoffrey Rush provides a realistic performance as the aging Leon Trotsky, on the run from Stalin's assassins. Edward Norton and Ashley Judd put in good cameos, Norton as a young Nelson Rockefeller. The cinematography, directing, and musical score are all on target. The only shortcoming of the film is that it tries to cram too much of her life into the movie. If the film-makers had cut the number of events down by a third and filled the time getting to know the characters it would have been a better movie.",Frida
40,Bob-45,'Chick Flick' With Lots of Skin,7,7 December 2004,"Now that I've offended the sensibilities of many of you, let's talk about how this relates to 'Frida'. If you examine the art of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo, you find it provocative, compelling and painfully truthful. Well, the painful truth is that men and some women will flock to 'Frida' to ogle Salma Hyek naked, however brief these scenes are. Other women will be fascinated or repelled by Frida's intimate relationships with other women, both sexual and otherwise. Finally, there will be those of us fascinated by all these things, the historical and political trapping, the beauty, the pain and the love shared by Frida and famous Mexican artist Diego Rivera. Their love is the most fascinating thing of all. For Diego's and Frida's love survives numerous affairs, political intrigue, jealousy, separation and Frida's horribly deteriorating health. To reveal more would spoil this turbulent love story. Let's just say, the first half is much stronger than the second and that the movie should have given us more of Frida's last years, her suffering notwithstanding. The jump from Trotsky's assassination in 1940 to Frida's last days in 1953 is jarring, seemingly cut to meet a running time requirement. Further, director Julie Taymor shows no talent for displaying time passage. Five years pass between the first and second confrontation between Frida and Diego, yet for all we know only a year or so has passed. The abundant female nudity, particularly that of Hyek sometimes seems gratuitous till one realizes how 'Frida' herself integrated her nude body into her art. 'Frida' boasts some extraordinary performances, most notably Salma Hyeck, who convincing ages from 16 to 47. Equally as great is Albert Molina as Diego. 'Frida' boasts fine supporting performances from Valeria Golino as Diego's former wife, Roger Rees as Frida's loving father and Geoffrey Rush as Leon Trotsky. Despite her pain and personal torment, Frida was never a pitiable character. She was too tough, too free spirited and too prepared to commit the same kind of acts of infidelity as Diego. Nonetheless, Frida Kahlo was a compelling, fascinating woman, and I feel I'm a better person for discovering so thanks to Hyek, director Taymer and Molina. 'Frida' is a class act all the way, from the lovingly created art direction to the cinematography, editing and music. I give 'Frida' a '7'.",Frida
41,Rogue-32,Salma Hayek RULES,9,9 November 2002,"This is a very well-realized film, and the most inspired thing about it is the casting of Salma Hayek in the title role.After displaying amazing star quality in Desperado, Hayek has been sadly under-used by the film world - until this magnificent and passionate performance, which will surely get her an Oscar nomination if there's any hope for Hollywood at all. Proving herself capable of enormous range and blazingly intense depth, Hayek's Frida is a genuine flesh-and-blood individual who refuses to live life on the sidelines (as women were 'supposed' to do in those days). She was an artist in every sense of the word - taking and owning all that life gave her and transforming it into unflinching portraits of her soul. Supremely inspiring and deeply felt.",Frida
42,Rob-O-Cop,"breathtaking cinema, I'm speechless",9,11 November 2007,"I can't believe how good this movie was, on so many levels all at once. you're enjoying the amazing story of this woman and her life and thats interesting enough, and the acting is so good, and the look of it is so delicious and enticing, but then they go and do something brilliant with a painting fading into reality, or tie a detail in with an event, I'm going to have to watch this movie again an again to get all the levels of detail I suspect the director, writers and actors have put into this movie and even then I'm still going to have something new to discover next time.I made the lucky mistake of watching this movie in Spanish with English subtitles. I didn't know at the time of watching that it was actually in English. I'm glad I did because this made the movie all the more authentic for me. I've since gone back and watched it in English, but I recommend the Spanish version.I think this movie is all the more brilliant because I didn't expect it to be. It made me spend the day researching and reading about its topic. I've always respected Salma Hayek as a beautiful actress who has done respectable work in her films, but her work in this movie is so detailed and nuanced its going to be hard to see her do movies that give her lesser material to work with. I'll expect genius from her every time now, I guess thats not fair but she's that good, and we know it now.my only grip is with the mono brow. it was distracting at times, even on the forehead of someone as pleasing to look at as Salma. and it kept changing. but there it is in the paintings and real life so I guess I can't argue with that.This was great work all around. cinema can still deliver pleasant surprises it seems.",Frida
43,Pedro_H,"Slick, rounded and very well acted, but falling short of greatness.",7,1 December 2004,"Scenes from the - often troubled - life of the crippled Mexican painter Frida Kahlo.The problems of artists-on-film are well known: The layman has to be educated, and as soon as you do this starts the connoisseur complains about having their intelligence insulted. The film also has to find a way to appeal to those people that who are not fans of the central art - if only through ignorance. The obvious answer is to find a balance between the art, the artist and the life that drove it. Frida comes out quite well as an exercise in balance, although it tries to cover too much ground for its modest budget. It also wants us to believe that Salma Hayek - born circa 1966 - can still play a virgin schoolgirl!(Note to all film makers: Platting your lead's hair and dressing her in a school uniform won't cut her age in half. If it did ALL short women would be at it!)From a personal point of view, this film failed to sell me the idea that Frida was anything more than a pleasing abstractist with strong personal messages. I sense - from the film proper - that she never considered herself one of the all-time greats either and, initially, even questions whether she has any talent at all!The producers takes the risky view that the art of the artist should be represented in (ocassional) moving form: Quite effecting, even if it does involve representing another person's art in a way that the original artist might not have approved of. This movie doesn't try to give any flowing narrative (other than always going forward in time) and prefers the scenes-from-a-life approach. By a wild coincidence, rather than design, Frida had a collision with major world history. Rubbing their hands with glee (at a real piece of drama to get their teeth in to!) the script hopes that key facts surrounding the death of Trotsky are not too well known to the viewer. Sorry, not in my case!(The Assassination of Trotsky (1972), with Richard Burton in the lead, is often quoted as one of the worst films ever made! Bad as it is, I still think it has some small educational value!) Husband Alfred Molina (playing muralist Diego Rivera) is probably just as good an artist and lets the film become a two-for-the-price-of-one deal. He is one of the those ""special people"" artists that presumes that his undoubted talent allows him license to put his hand up any skirt he wants. Not that the bisexual Frida is any kind of moral angel either - even with dusty old politicians.(I never got to grips whether the ""free copulation"" situation was political or personal. Mexican leftist politics has often had a sexual slant that is impossible to summate or explain here.) Having sat through the appalling Pollock (directed and starring Ed Harris) earlier in the year I was pleased to come across a life-on-canvass product that offered basic entertainment and engaging performances. The only thing I didn't like is what I call the ""male stripper syndrome"": behaviour that men have traditionally been attacked for suddenly becoming admirable - and even courageous - when engaged in by women.",Frida
44,esteban1747,More lively Frida,8,2 February 2004,"If compared the former version of the director Paul Leduc with the present one of Julie Taymor, one should acknowledge that this version is more attractive for most of the fans of cinema. The former one is very original since there were no dialogues in the film but you should know something about Frida in order to understand the person and the context where she developed herself. Here Salma Hajek reflects all virtues and sins of this Mexican revolutionary woman. It was also easy to see the existing differences between two famous Mexican muralists, Diego Rivera (Alfred Molina) and Alfaro Siqueiros (Antonio Banderas). The first one was an anti Stalinist while Siqueiros followed the orders of the Soviet dictator. Both were violent men. Siqueiros and other communists pro Stalin were in fact responsible for the barbarian murder of Trotsky. In the case of Frida, she was well represented by Salma Hayek as a revolutionary, left wing of doubtful communist ideas, lesbian and intensive lover. The disorder of her marriage with Rivera it is well shown in the film, as well as their incredible love for each other.",Frida
45,bigverybadtom,"""I Love Frida?""",8,5 April 2018,"This movie evokes David Lean's ""Lawrence Of Arabia"" in a sense, that both movies were not intended to be straight biographies of their respective historical figures. In fact, this movie even made me think of the ""I Love Lucy"" sitcom, with Diego Rivera as the buffoon to Frida Kahlo the straight woman.The movie starts with Frida Kahlo at age 18, just before she had the accident while riding a bus, which would cause her crippling injuries she would carry for the remainder of her life. She is given a canvas and paints by her family to occupy her while she initially recovers, and she adopts a surrealistic style, and later meets and marries already famous muralist Diego Rivera. They become left-wing radicals while living in high society, move to the United States where Rivera would try to paint his mural depicting Lenin in the Rockefeller Center, then move back when the project is cancelled and the mural destroyed. Both spouses have many extramarital affairs, though Diego gets upset when his wife has one with Leon Trotsky. (I saw the movie in the theater, and the audience all groaned in mockery when Diego complained to Frida about it.)Like I said, the movie is drama rather than biography; we see Frida, despite her sufferings, as strong and laughing at her many troubles. We don't see what moves her politically or artistically, but the movie is for entertainment and not education.",Frida
46,museumofdave,A Brightly Colored Biopic Where Director's Idiosyncratic Style Matches Subject,7,22 April 2013,"What's not to like? From the onset, the vivid colors alone dazzle, along with a superb sense of composition and an obviously earnest attempt to capsulize the life of an artist into a commercially successful film. The music in this limited biopic is intrinsic to the action, and one scene with Frida and an unexpected dancing partner, hypnotizes. The acting from both Hayek and Molina is involved and convincing, both as artists and lovers. Two caveats: one cannot effectively capsulize a vivid lifetime of artistic achievement (including a little theory and some leftist politics) into two hours--pity it couldn't have been three. Second, three cameos, even if well done, distract from our suspension of disbelief as we exclaim--look-- its Banderas in a fright wig! or isn't that Geoffrey Rush beneath that beard? Their acting is not in question, merely that the story becomes so convincing their sudden appearance is distracting. Still, a worthwhile film full of life and color and a literate commentary from director Taymor",Frida
47,EmperorNortonII,¡Viva Frida!,8,26 November 2002,"""Frida"" is a beautifully done biopic about Mexican artist and icon Frida Kahlo.  Salma Hayek plays this role very well.  She exhibits all the passion that goes into being an artist, especially when playing off Alfred Molina, who plays Diego Rivera, husband of Frida Kahlo, and a famous Mexican artist in his own right.  What really impressed me was the artistic references in the movie.  I loved seeing the paintings coming to life!  I also liked the surreal animated sequences, particularly the hospital nightmare, populated with Day of the Dead-style skeletons.  Few movies have ever made me regard them as a work of art.  ""Frida"" is definitely one of them!",Frida
48,Spanner-2,Splendid bio-pic,8,24 February 2003,"This film, which was nominated for several Oscars including Best Actress, is a pretty effective film tracing the life of Mexican painter Frida Kahlo, played with gusto by Salma Hayek, who sheds her trademark goofiness to here superbly embody this character. Alfred Molina as her husband is also excellent as are many other supporting performances from name actors. A solid film, that suffers some minor flaws from the narrative but on the whole is a pretty darn good film, with super production values. GRADE: A-",Frida
49,bregund,The titular character deserved much better,6,13 February 2015,"Frida's life was a soap opera, and seemingly tailor-made for a film, but the tiny budget and mediocre performances don't do justice for such a brilliant artist. The lethargic pacing and frustrating sense of unexplored avenues gives the viewer the sense of an unfinished film. Salma Hayek is suitable in the main role, but she lacks the finesse and stage presence to portray such an iconic figure. Alfred Molina, normally a brilliant, chameleonic actor who vanishes into whatever role he plays, seems strangely inert. Even Geoffrey Rush as Trotsky isn't that great.This claustrophobic film is mostly confined to the interiors of houses or studios, except for a hike up an Aztek pyramid and the famous bus accident that gave Frida lifelong pain. Even the trip to New York is a cheap, unsatisfying pastiche of flat graphics that any high school film studio could put together. One gets the impression that if they threw twenty million more at this film, it would have been as visually stunning as the artist's paintings themselves, which by the way aren't featured as prominently as you might expect.I guess I was expecting the film equivalent of Frida's magical surrealism, but what came across instead was a paint-by-numbers drama force-fitting famous lines everyone knows, such as the mother's lament that Frida's marriage to Diego was like a dove marrying an elephant.",Frida
50,osloj,"Bland and Empty Film, Typical Hollywood Junk",4,12 November 2002,"After hearing about all the grandeur that this film would convey, I was looking forward to seeing the attempt to put the life of the Mexican painter Frida Kahlo onto the screen but I also came in with healthy skepticism. This was a big disappointment, not only is there nothing important stated in the film, but the acting is absolutely horrible.  It was an understatement to say that this was pure ""torture"" to people who want to be intellectually stimulated or at least watch a decent film about someone's life without resorting to that fact that the director wanted us to see Frida as nothing but a ""hero and martyr"" and a one dimensional character, which is what is conveyed throughout this awful film.  Julie Taymor (a pretentious playwright and puppet maker w/ one film to her credit) instead gives us a Hollywood cliche about the artist's life, including meaningless pseudo-surrealist interjections which bring to life some of the paintings in a boring fashion. Hayek is tepid, stale and dull and never really brings any vividness or passion into one of the most vibrant artists of the century, instead, we get to see her breasts about 20% of the time, not that I am against that, but a film should be about something more important that conventional sex scenes which have no point being on the screen and give us feelings into the art and life and relationship with Rivera (played by the dismal Alfred Molina). Taymor is unsure whether she wants to actually let us examine Kahlo's life or merely show us a predictable storyline that doesn't fit anywhere, she meanders through the most ""famous"" episodes in Frida's life, including her horrific accident and sprinkles a few twists and interpretations.  She has a turbulent relationship with Rivera but again, no souls are studied.  Trotsky (played by the laughable Geoffrey Rush with a bad Russian accent) has no meaning at all, instead he is nothing but a sex toy which was disgusting to behold on the screen. We feel as if we are watching a bunch of idiots on the screen because not one of the actors hired for this film show any enthusiasm or any acting capabilities, although Antonio Banderas as the artist Siqueiros is the closest thing but he is given only about 2 minutes to work. Painting was an important part of Frida's life but we don't really get to even see her at work here.  If you are looking for a literary study of the artist, this is most definately not the place to look.  This is a tragic disgrace to the artist, and merely a conventional approach that gives rich Americans, who compromise 97% of the film audience, a chance to say that they know Frida after watching this.  After all, it was the American upper middle class that co-opted Frida's works and life and called it their own, to put on t-shirts and mugs.  What is sad, as I saw while reading the other reviews of this film, is that people won't know that nothing was actually stated in the film because they are accustomed to mindless Hollywood garbage which just wants to take famous names and make more money so we have people calling this ""brilliant and wonderful"".  I think a Mexican director with decent actors who know their craft is what is necessary if you really want to make a respectable and credible.  This film was not even worth making it is so bad.",Frida
51,diane-34,A movie's movie!,10,1 January 2003,"When I walked into the theatre yesterday I expected an interesting look into the life of a female painter living during an extraordinary period of Mexican history-I did not expect what I got which was a totally absorbing story, with very, very good performances by the two main actors and direction that was easily as good as anything I've seen previously.The first of this trilogy that struck me was the direction by Julie Taymor: the viewer is struck very early in the film with the richness of her directoral palette-the use of camera movement and the variety of angles and distances included in the visual composition of the movie. Taymor didn't just pull out a grab bag of superficially ""clever"" camerawork but a considered richness of perspective that enriches each scene of the film.The second part of the trilogy involves the script or the canvas upon which this remarkable story is played out-the story that is Frida's life is dramatic enough for three movies.Ah-and finally we deal with the remarkable performances of Hayek and Molina-performances that are the impasto for the creation of the main figures.  The richness of the story demands exceptional performances by the two main actors and the director certainly gets performances to match this depth.Above all-don't miss this film!",Frida

In the movie Frida staring Salma Hayek in the starring role, you get a nice overview of this larger than life artist. It begins as Frida is a young rambunctious girl who is ready to take on whatever challenge is thrown her own way. Probably the biggest influence on her life was the terrible bus accident that collided with the trolley. This incident left Frida in pain for the rest of her life and prevented her from bearing children. But of course, the other major effect in her life was the long and passionate love affair with Diego Rivera. He was a man with many dominate interests, but painting and women ruled his life. He took to Frida and this began a roller coaster of a ride union. The exhibit at the High Museum of Art in Atlanta is entitled Passion, Politics, and Paintings and the movie covers all these pinnacle intersections of Frida and Diego's lives. Some of the most popular paintings are showcased in the movie and are now present for anyone to view in the largest exhibit in the United States on the Frida and Diego. Frida the movie is a timeless tale of a woman who lived her life fully and did not allow her physical limitations from creating the vision that emitted from the inner sanctum of her soul.",Frida

I don't think anyone else could have played this role But Salma. You can see that Salma literally pours in her own blood, sweat and tears in her awesome portrayal of an extremely strong, intelligent and talented woman painter whom broke so many boundaries and constraints placed on women in her time with grace, strength and NO APOLOGIES!!! You GO GIRL!! ;DWonderful movie for anyone familiar with Surrealist painter Frida Kahlo and her life struggles as a Hispanic woman in a men's world of art. The pain and beauty she transferred from her world onto the canvas and other mediums.

Sure, The Pianist is one of my favorite films, i also liked a bit Schindler's List. Rare exceptions. But this one is just like 90% of the bios produced: tedious and uninteresting. Sure she was perhaps a woman with will to life, she had his physical obstacles and tried to win them and stuff, but there is really nothing more in the film. Talking about the plot, i have major problems with the fact that it has little to none focus for the secondary characters, which clearly would be interesting aces if earned a fair amount of screen time to them. The focus always being on Frida really don't helped this film, since that she was either drinking and yelling like crazy or just painting. And that is also my point:The story has no conflicts besides the traditional husband- wive discussion. The relationship of Frida with Trotski is either pointless or bad explored, because it just added useless running time to film. Also, some supposed jokes aren't funny or what's ever. This film tried to expand other limits beyond the melodrama and it clearly failed. But OK, i kinda liked to see the special cameos of Antonio Banderas and Edward Norton, which instantly took this film out of the stagnation and for once brought my interest in it. The cinematography is very nice, the art direction is terrific and got some inspirations from the Spanish paintings and their use of vivid colors in the characters, to contrast with a more neutral ambient. The music used in the film is bad, definitely not a fan. The editing was OK, it wouldn't help that much in this film anyways unless if they had cut lots of pointless scenes from it.The acting by Salma Hayek was indeed good, not impressive, but she did her job fine.

56,bix171,Julie Taymor's Triumph,10,26 July 2003,"Salma Hayek may be the ostensible star of this biography of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo but director Julie Taymor is the real driving force, triumphantly displaying an astute eye that crams each frame with as much information as possible and boldly exposing the viewer to a variety of artistic experiments--the project seems as important to Taymor as it does to Hayek, whose sincere passion, as producer, for the subject is honorable and reverent. It's a bit of an about-face for Taymor, whose feature debut, `Titus', a graphic adaptation of Shakespeare's `Titus Andronicus', was filled with time-warps and sparse sets. Here, Taymor tells the story with simplicity, the use of some picturesque pastels that create an authoritative mise en scene, and some fun animated moments (she employs delightful dioramas to indicate shifts in settings and time; a garish hallucinatory sequence was created by the Quay Brothers, whose work has always been permeated with Kahlo's influence) presented with an unabashed fervor that pays homage to Kahlo's art while enhancing her own. Taymor works aggressively, approaching Kahlo in an almost masculine manner; as a result, she seems to respond better to the male aspects of the performances and though Hayek does a decent job as Kahlo (herself exhibiting many mannish tendencies), she's acted off the screen by Alfred Molina, as husband/mentor Diego Rivera, with an exuberant yet smoothly modulated performance that shows up Hayek's histrionics, heartfelt as they are. There are a number of interesting supporting performers, including Roger Rees (as Kahlo's father), Valeria Golino, Geoffrey Rush and, briefly, Diego Luna (from `Y tu mama tambien') as well as cameos from Ashley Judd, Antonio Banderas and Edward Norton as Nelson Rockefeller. Taymor shows that with this and `Titus' under her belt that she can deftly navigate between commercial and alternative narratives and that her natural creativity can only enhance any project she chooses to work on; hers is a rare and welcome talent indeed and it's employed to great effect here.",Frida

Well, I loved the bright colors of the costumes.  The music was wonderful, I also loved the surrealistic morphing of Frida's paintings.  Best of all, I loved the house where Diego and Frida lived, which confirmed that I have been right all along about American houses being dull and characterless.  I noticed that Selma Hayek was much shorter than I had realised, and looked like a teacher I had in elementary school. Otherwise, the film was the usual bohemians living in sin, doing as they like, getting drunk, having afairs, fighting, going left wing.  We could have been watching Reds, Lust for Life, Carrington, Svengali or any film about left wing bohemian artists.  Alfred Molina, always a superb actor, lifted the film from its Lifetime Network routine. Thank goodness.

Why it was felt necessary to portray her thus, is a mystery to me. It may seem trivial, but it really did detract from what is essentially an immense performance.Hayek excels, and definitely makes the movie more palatable for mainstream audiences who may not be interested in the social and artistic merits of what is an important historical era. She is ably assisted by the talented Molina, and the beautiful sets and photography are a fitting tribute to the story of one quite amazing woman.So even if you think art is bunkum and history is naff, I think you will enjoy this sad but uplifting tale of a beautiful, spirited and unforgettable woman.

The screenplay has good dialogue, and doesn't leave any questions without answering them very well, the only part wrong with it is how it respects it's lead character, and I guess this is because it had so many writers. The acting is some of the best putt in a film for years, and actually some of the best acting I have ever seen in a film, Alfred Molina and Salma Hayek should have both won Oscars, and Edward Norton, Diego Luna, Antonio Banderas, and Ashley Judd are all also extremely good.

62,ilovedolby,`Frida' is the role that audiences will remember Salma Hayek for.,8,17 March 2003,"`Frida' is the role that audiences will remember Salma Hayek for. The former Mexican soap opera star gives a superb performance portraying the nearly crippled, and troubled Mexican artist, Frida Kahlo. The artistic director, Julie Taymor (`Titus,' and `The Lion King' on Broadway) provides a visually dramatic film incorporating Kahlo's paintings into live action scenes that provides for an intriguing, yet simple camera trick that can dazzle the eye beyond any expensive visual affects shot. 	The real Frida lived a life dominated by both beauty and pain. At a young age she survived a bus crash that left her in a body cast for a long period of time. While being bed-ridden and unable to walk, her family encouraged her to paint and Kahlo soon discovered her marvelous talent. With the help of her idol, Diego Rivera, the famed painter and womanizer, Kahlo's works grew to integrate images of splendor mixed with the elements of pain that she endured in her life: her troubled marriage to Rivera, and her miscarriage, to name a few. Among other traits that existed in Kahlo's life were her political ideals- along with her husband, Rivera, she was a communist, and she was bisexual. 	Beyond the aspects of the story, the film generally tells the truth about the famed Mexican painter. Hayek is being nominated for a Best Actress Oscar, along with the film's other nominations for Best Art Direction (Felipe Fernandez del Paso, Hannia Robledo), Best Costume Design (Julie Weiss), Best Makeup (John E. Jackson, Beatrice De Alba), Best Original Score (Elliot Goldenthal), and Best Song-`Burn It Blue' (Elliot Goldenthal, Julie Taymor). 	Alfred Molina provides a fantastic performance as Kahlo's husband, Rivera. Despite his constant womanizing, the audience can tell that he does have a real love and respect for his wife's genius. Pay particular attention to the brief performances of Antonia Banderas, Ashley Judd, Geoffrey Rush, Ed Norton, and Valeria Golino, as they all add a sense of intrigue to the story of the Kahlo. Also, the musical score for the film by composer Elliot Goldenthal is extremely eloquent, providing a traditional Mexican feel with conventional orchestrations. ***1/2",Frida

The film beautifully captures the essence of Kahlo who managed to rise above all the trauma and continued to be a vibrant & warm human being. Her art, though not conventionally pretty, was very eloquent in describing how she perceived the things around her.Another great thing about the movie is the fact that neither Frida nor her husband Diego Rivera are portrayed as angels or monsters; both have their shortcomings but are decent human beings at the core.The only problem that I had with the movie was that the film doesn't clarify what vision these great artists have regarding the future of Mexico & her people.

Nor did FRIDA offer its audience substance beyond the visual presentation. The protagonist was into the early communist movement, for example, but there is not enough of a hint of why this was so.  This also holds for her slightly better known husband, the early 20th Century Mexican painter Diego Rivera.  Scenes open and close like soldiers passing by in a parade. A film worth making should be based on a meaningful and significant scenario. FRIDA is a laundry list abstract of the little-known painter's life and because it is not well written it will more than likely be quickly forgotten. If the script is not there, the legs will not be there.That said, there are some marvelous graphic elements in the film that while not seminal delight the eye while a wonderful Hispanic music score and its on-camera performers warm the heart.

Just like Frida's life and her paintings.If life and movies are not supposed to be what we want them to be i.e. Optimistic, cheerful and with a happy ending. But life is not so yellow, right?Similarly, if movies are dark, grim, realistic and vulnerable like all of us. Then what's the point of art at all? If we're not* hopeful.The movie try to deal in between these two spectrums. I believe it's an honest telling without much dramatization (as biographies should be). Yet among these sorry lives of our troubled artists, there lies a hope.Like I said, it is a disturbing movie and I'm uncertain how to see it positively or to categorize it. Yet I don't regret watching it.It strictly requires viewers discretion for it's dealing with the topic of fedility, pleasure, marriage.",Frida
68,andrabem,Frida: an emotional odyssey through life,10,13 January 2007,"I avoided seeing ""Frida"" for a long time because I thought that it was another typical ""biographical film"" made in Hollywood, mixing drama and comedy and maybe with an ""artistic"" touch in it. My mistake! Salma Hayek gives an astounding performance showing all the colors of the rainbow from sadness to despair, joy to happiness. Her acting is so intense, that it led me to tears and laughter. And the film is very beautiful and poetical. Well, I'm running out of adjectives in trying to write about ""Frida"". All I can tell you is that before watching ""Frida"" I had a very superficial knowledge about her. I knew that she was Riveras wife and and a painter too. I knew about her tragic life and had heard praises about her paintings. I knew vaguely about Trotsky's stay in Rivera's house. That was all I knew about her. This was only cold historical knowledge.After seeing this film I acquired emotional knowledge about Frida. I've learned later through IMDb that this film was a lifelong project of Salma Hayek. Fortunately, Salma found a very gifted director in Julie Taymor.Salma Hayek is one of the greatest actresses I've ever seen. Now my interest in Frida was raised and when I see again (through the internet) her paintings I'll see them with new eyes.",Frida
69,gws-2,A near miss,7,15 January 2004,"""Frida"" is saved from mediocrity by the wonderful performances of Selma Hayek and Alfred Molina, and by its imaginative cinematography. Unfortunately, the underlying story of the love affair between the title character, Frida Kahlo, and her husband, Diego Rivera, tells an unpleasant tale of irresponsibility and betrayal.  Nevertheless, Kahlo's art is cleverly used to tell her story and Hayek's and Molina's terrific performances manage to invest Kahlo and Rivera with an attractiveness I suspect they lacked in real life.  This is a good although not a great film; recommended, 7 out of 10.",Frida

Most people could watch Salma Hayek all day and I'm no exception - she can act as well as go well with the curtains.  Alfred Molina is a great loss to the London stage (is it really 10 years) but a great plus to any movie in which he plays a major part.There was a stage version of this story in London recently - a Robert Lepage creation - which more or less mirrored the story as set out in the film.  We enjoyed that play but enjoyed the film more, as cinema allows some of the special effects to bring the art, period and location to life more effectively.Worth seeing, yes really.",Frida
71,groggo,Not willing to suspend disbelief because of language,4,9 April 2007,"Before the early 1960s, when Hollywood would set a film in a foreign country, you'd routinely hear American and other English-speaking actors jabbering in broken English with an assortment of other accents (French, German, Spanish or whatever) thrown in. It was a little silly, but no one questioned it much.This trend was broken in 1962 with the 'Longest Day,' and a year later with 'The Great Escape'. In 1965, John Frankheimer made 'The Train,' a great action yarn in which Burt Lancaster spoke perfect English despite playing a Frenchman. Paul Scofield, as the Nazi officer, did the same with a slight German accent. It set a standard for common sense in film dialogue. In Frida, the pre-1960s linguistic film-flamming returns with a jolt. Try as I might, I could not accept this film with any degree of seriousness. Most of the actors in the film are from Spain or Mexico, yet they all speak to each other in Spanish-inflected English. It's a recipe for silliness. While the Hispanics are speaking English with heavy accents, we have the opposite happening: Alred Molina (Diego Rivera) and Roger Rees (Frida's father) are British actors and they speak English with heavy Mexican accents. Meanwhile, all the songs, prayers, vigils, signs, etc. are entirely in Spanish. The remarkable thing is that I can't find a critic anywhere who even MENTIONS these glaring contradictions. This loopy linguistic decision aside, this wasn't a bad film, but hardly a great one. It might have been different if I could forget that Salma Hayek, no matter how hard she tries to depict Frida Kahlo, just can't make it work. Unibrow or not, Hayek just can't resist being glamorous, a look she has long cultivated and promoted in the haute couture salons of the world. In real life, I don't think the anti-glamour socialist Frida would have been pleased to see Hayek -- her antithesis -- portraying her.",Frida

What's with the English-speaking characters? Why have them all speak English-with-a-Spanish-accent when they are all supposed to be speaking Spanish? Are the film-makers so patronising that they think we can't handle subtitles? Yes, apparently. OK, so let's have everyone speak English. But then they're going to have to sing in English, and their political banners are going to have to be written in English. Oh dear... didn't think of that, did you? And what are you going to do when your Spanish characters go to America? That's right: have them speak English-with-a-Spanish-accent. Which they would have done, of course, in an English-speaking country. What a mess. What a patronising mess.3. An obviously low budget makes demands on imagination and inspiration. So what do we get? Naff sequences of Rivera as King Kong. Jeez.4. Rivera says he won't change his mural. He has principles, he says. He does? What are they? The movie never tells us. Perhaps we should have had sub-titles for his political banners, so we might have understood what he was campaigning for/against... But then, if he spoke in English-with-a-Spanish-accent all the time, why were his banners in Spanish anyway? See above...5. Frida is in constant pain. She is? Only when it suits the story. She seems pretty capable of ignoring the pain most of the time. Now, this may be true to life, but you have got to convince the viewer of the case.6. What language are they all speaking in when Trotsky comes to stay? They all seem to understand each other perfectly well. English? Russian? Spanish? 7.

73,ereinion,Great historical movie,10,21 March 2008,"I really enjoyed this movie. It is biopics like these I really like to watch. And when they are well directed and well-written and featuring such a good cast, it really is a treat. Salma Hayek finally has her moment of greatness after a long time of showing potential but never quite fulfilling it to the maximum. Here she is simply wonderful as Frida Kahlo, the early 20th century Mexican artist and icon.Frida is a person who lived an interesting life, to say the least. Her childhood was relatively happy, yet marred with a chronic illness which she eventually overcame. After being in a traffic accident while at the university, she becomes invalid for a while. But she overcomes this and the strength of her spirit turns her into a successful painter and a famous personality in her native Mexico. Diego Rivera is the love of her life, played just as wonderfully by Alfred Molina who also blossoms for real in his part after many years of under-appreciated parts. His infidelity puts their strong relationship to test several times before he commits the ultimate sin and cheats on her with her sister. She also had her share of extramarital relationships, both with men (among them Lev Trotsky) and women.""Frida"" is a pulsating, dramatic and sensual film. Frida's bisexuality is also clearly displayed here and there are a couple lesbian sex scenes thrown in, but they are done in a tasteful manner. Especially the one with Frida and the Paris chanteuse, played by the alluring Karine Plantadit-Bageot. The erotic interplay between the two is done in an artistic, almost choreographic way and thus doesn't appear that pornographic. Many have pointed out the dance scene with Ashley Judd as the most sensual one, but this is certainly the one I find more sensual.This is a fascinating look at the life of a fascinating person. It is made to please different persons. Whether you are after a historical biopic, a moving drama or simply an exciting and sensual film, this will be your pick.",Frida
74,jimi99,visual feast,8,15 November 2002,"This film is certainly a beautiful and often dazzling display of Julie Taymor's innovative visual style, and she pushes the envelope of sexuality here like she did of violence in ""Titus"", sometimes it seems just to rub the audiences face in it rather than to serve the narrative, but always to great effect.  ""Frida"" bursts with life & color & the global politics of the 20's and 30's, and as a biopic it works well in fleshing out an artist who has become very totemic in recent years, more to feminists and disability activists than to painters and artists I think.        As with any biopic or historical drama, fundamental questions always arise about accuracy, the agenda of the author/director, and the romanticizing of the subject.  I personally kept thinking, without knowing too much about Kahlo and Rivera, that they were undoubtedly, in ""real life,"" much less likable than these two characters as portrayed by Hayek and Molina.  And yet, the second, conflicting question arises ""Does it matter?"" Ultimately, it doesn't, because this is an entertainment and a romantic saga that honestly tries not to flinch from the pain and heartache of this woman's life.     It also gets into Frida's art in a uniquely organic way and in that sense I found it superior to recent artist biopics like ""Basquiat"" and ""Pollack,"" which were full of angst and in the latter case, downright boredom, and didn't really succeed in showing how the artist's work mirrored his life.       I would have given this 4 stars for its memorable imagery, music, and rendering of the artist's work, except for the Trotsky story, which was no doubt true and politically significant, but Geoffrey Rush was so badly miscast and laughable with his changing accent, and the romance so unpleasant, that it detracted a half-star from my rating.

As a result, Frida saw the dark side of life and painted some of the most amazing abstract works of art that I have ever seen.Frida formed a bond with the famous political painter, Diego Rivera. The two share a stormy relationship and eventually marry. Frida overlooks most of Diego's extramarital affairs until Diego goes after Frida's sister. Thus, she feels betrayed and leaves him.Frida herself is a kinky persona sharing relationships with both men and women. There is a very erotic scene of Frida dancing tango with another woman.Frida eventually meets Leon Trotsky and the two united by their socialist political views end up having an affair. When Trotsky is murdered, Frida and Rivera are suspected but are later exonerated.In a touching scene in the movie, an incredibly ill Frida is brought in her bed to attend her own art exhibit at which her talent is expounded to a crowd by Rivera.This movie should not be missed and anyone with an appreciation for good art would love it!",Frida

Hayak shows her tits a few times to keep the boyz interested; there are some lesbian interludes to show Frida's bisexual side; Diego comes and goes and has sex with everyone he can. Hayak plays it as a modern and brash young woman full of herself and the world.I thought we might learn about: Mexico in the 1920s-30s and the communist influence there; Frida's art; Rivera's art; other artists; art & communism; Frida's family; Rivera's family; Frida's motivations. We get a little of this but it mostly revolves around blood and sex.The script is TV-grade, with dramatic pauses and shallow talk.

In the movie, she says ""My pictures are private""(I do not remember exact expression) to Leon Trotsky, who says ""loneliness and pain is what everyone has"".

Make no mistake, Frida is definitely a chick flick.....a chick flick that shows Salma Hayek naked about a half a dozen times! I know I'm a pig, but seriously guys, this is the only reason you'd want to watch this film. So, let her make you watch it and enjoy.Now that my lewd itch for the day has been scratched, let's get to the actual film. Frida is supposed to be a story about the amazing life of a wonderful artist who had her fair share of tragedy, greatness, and heartache. The film and cinematography are truly stunning, using moving adaptations of Frida's art, certain scenes and moods are expressed with passion. Visually, it is quite epic and gives the actors much scenery to chew. Speaking of acting, Hayek and Molina are at the top of their game here and each have much character to work with. Hayek probably deserved her Oscar nod. There are also several interesting cameos by several great actors such as Ed Norton and Antonio Banderas...but their parts are very minimal and don't contribute much to the story.While the aforementioned acting and visuals are truly great and impressive, the story for just didn't cut it. I simply did not care about it or what happened really. I was constantly looking at my watch as a result and felt that much of the film could have been cut down. There seemed to be many pointless scenes that added nothing to the picture. It could be that this is just not my cup of tea and I'm fine with that. I have no doubt that this is a favorite of many, but it probably caters to the more feminine crowd. I'm not saying it was a bad film, it's just not my bag and didn't do anything for me. It probably didn't help that I watched both Kill Bill films directly before this one.If you enjoy either of the leads, you'll probably find some interesting elements here.

Unlike Basquiat, this tormented artist is not discovered by the art community young or become a meteor that burns out. Nor is her pain primarily self-inflicted.  Like all artists, she is very emotional, yet the story is not cliche in how it plays out.  I was a bit disturbed about a story about Mexican artists using all Euro-looking actors rather than any of Indian ancestry (no plain women at all - it was like a beauty pageant).  Where is the realism of ""Real Women Have Curves?""  I think it would have helped the story to resist the glamorization.  Otherwise, very interesting, well-told, well-acted cinematic story.",Frida

82,PoppyTransfusion,"'Her work is acid and tender, hard as steel and fine as a butterfly's wing ...'",9,24 July 2011,"... lovable as a smile, cruel as the bitterness of life ...'So Diego Rivera describes Frida Kahlo's paintings in one of the final scenes in which an exhibition of her work is shown in Mexico for the first time. As a testament to Kahlo's art this film is magnificent and its director, Julie Taymor, is herself a cinematic artist, so keen is her eye for detail and colour.The film spans the life of Mexican artist Frida from age 18 in 1925, just before the near fatal bus accident that almost killed her and left her badly injured for the remainder of her life, until her death in 1954 aged 49. It portrays the complicated relationship between her and Rivera, at the time Mexico's most famous artist and communist, and presents a picture of a fascinatingly rich life that included love affairs with Leon Trotsky and Josephine Baker.Salma Hayek plays Frida and is perfectly cast as are many of the other actors, who physically resemble the people they play. One of the criticisms levelled at the film is that it is not in Spanish. This is a legitimate criticism as many of the cast, especially the bit players, are Mexican. It is deeply ironic that Frida who so identified with indigenous Mexico has her story told in English by an international cast. Nonetheless the film is well-made with authentic set design and captures the spirit of Frida's time.Taymor illustrates Kahlo's creative life, as much as her colourful existence, often using Frida's own paintings to create scenes. For example, when Diego and Frida wed for the first time (they later divorce only to re-marry) Frida's wedding portrait entitled 'Frida and Diego Rivera' (1931) represents the exchange of vows. First we see a still of the painting, then the painting in animation before this gives way to the actors in scene. Moments like this pepper the film; a clever device that constantly reminds us of Frida the artist.The film evokes the painful existence of Frida's physical life, again using her paintings to heighten the audience's sense of her injured body. There are many moving moments such as the miscarriage Frida suffered and the baby in bits, the steel girdle that encased her torso to support her spine in later life and her twilight years when she was bedridden. Her life was truly a triumph over adversity.Frida's paintings are described in the film as ""agonised poetry on canvas""; this poignant line aptly sums up the 'agonised poem' that Taymor paints of Kahlo's brief life.",Frida

It feels good to see actors really going for it, taking chances, building their talent- you truly get that Salma is a force that's here to stay, and a powerful force for the Latino community, who might finally get a lead actress who takes home Oscar.",Frida
84,fatcat-73450,Lovely Directing and Excellent Casting,6,5 November 2021,"Rather than being a strict biography about Friday Kahlo, this is a movie that chronicles the relationship between the eponymous artist and Diego Rivera, a muralist 20 years her senior, who also appears from the very first scene in the movie.Diego Rivera is portrayed as a man who has a freewheeling approach to sex and relationships, while Frida is portrayed as being more or less sufficiently in love with the man (or at least in admiration of him) to overlook these foibles, but not without extreme friction.Frida and Diego's biographies seems to be rife with interesting enough episodes to carry the movie's plot. There are massive car crashes, political assassinations, and big financial sacrifices for the sake of artistic integrity. That's fortunte because much of the movie is otherwise poorly developed. We don't know why Frida is so head-over-heels for Rivera, don't get a real sense of what they feel for each other, and don't really know why she says with him despite all the trouble he causes her, just to name some examples. I also have not much of a conception of Frida's artistic career after watching it.The acting and casting are good, especially that of the actor who plays Diego. He not only bears a resemblance to the man but also effectively plays a sleazy and immature, yet charming, lecher.The direction of the shots and scene transitions are artistic and appropriate for this work.All the dialogue is in English with Hispanic accents. Cheesy but the movie is otherwise good enough to overlook it.Honourable Mentions: Barfly (1987). About an artist who chooses to lead a wild lifestyle.

But the real surprise in this movie is Roger Rees, who gives a superb performance as Frida's father.  Is you're just used to seeing him in one of his comic and bumbling American TV performances, he was just wonderful in Frida.Unfortunately, he is completely lost by the script - once Trotsky comes to town, her father disappears and is never seen in the movie again, completely without explanation.  Another odd part in the script is when the couple go from being almost poverty-stricken in America, to returning to Mexico and being able to build two adjoining, modern houses. The movie was an interesting look at two iconoclastic artists, and I definitely recommend it (even if Antonio Banderas and Ashley Judd were visible for way too short a time in it!).",Frida

This movie actually brings the art alive and makes the art aninherent part of the artist's life.  The way Frida's paintings comealive or are sometimes represented as part of the scene isexcellent.  Frida's imagination coming alive is both humorous(Diego's fall from grace in NY paralleled with King Kong's fall fromthe Empire State Building) and highly sensitive (the miscarriage). The way colors blend in and out were amazing, even on a tiny TVlike mine.  As for Frida's life, I don't know what is accurate andwhat is not, but the pain is there and we feel it over and over againwith her, just as we triumph with her achievements.  Salma Hayekdid an excellent job.What I found disconcerting in this movie were the faked accents.They sometimes got in the way and I couldn't understand some ofwhat was said (sometimes it was too low, like at the NY dinerscene).  Trotsky's accent was exceptionally horrible althoughRivera's was troublesome too.  I also think the songs should havehad subtitles. They obviously carried important messages, or so Iassume because they took up so much airspace (for lack of abetter word) and often were linked to the events.  A date with thefinal line would have been good too.Overall very impressive movie. I highly recommend it for everyone,but especially for art lovers.",Frida

One scene really impressed me:when the doctor is about to release her `mummified' body by breaking the cast,that is when Frida  becomes the brave bold artist(it works more than metaphorically) AS IT she gets the key to `her prision of pain'.Also the filme concentrates in DIEGO RIVERA because,I guess,he was the supporter of her talent and also the inspiration for Frida melancholic and(at times) creepy portraits.I also loved the the film makes justice to her wonderful weird sense of humor.Maybe the downside of the movie is that our protagonist is too `sympathetic' for the audience BUT after I witnessed her physical pain,I will try not to complain anymore about my headaches or when I have the flu.Notice: Ashley Judd screamig VIVA LA REVOLUCIÓN!

89,Alex-Tsander,"Disappointing, corny, uninformative, confused and cliché-ridden,",2,9 April 2007,"Having studied the history of art academically for five years at college and university, I was aware of Kahlo only vaguely, as a shadowy player on the fringes of the Surrealist movement. I was familiar with a few of her self-portraits and knew about the appalling accident that had such an impact on her life. My first criticism of this movie is that it adds very little to this outline. Very old fashioned in style making repeated use of corny montage sequences to depict happy periods of the artists life. Many of the scenes, such as the argument between Diego Rivera and Roberto Siqueros have a ""We Are History"" quality about them: ""...and now, comrade Danton, it is time for the French Revolution!"" We see nothing of the intellectual context of Kahlo's existence, merely hoary old clichés about the passions of the vie-revolutionairre! Nor, later, is it mentioned what became of Rivera's being suspected in the assassination of Trotsky. Nor was it mentioned that Siqueros was suspected of the first, botched, attempt on Trotsky's life.Whilst Salma Hayek manages to look something like Kahlo, albeit more attractive, even with that giant cyclops eyebrow, her enacting the teen-age schoolgirl Frida is risible. Hayek is a gorgeous, curvaceous mature woman. As a schoolgirl she was entirely unbelievable. In common with most movies about artists, this one made almost no effort to try to get inside why the artist made the work that she did. We instead get, more or less, the old romantic cliché of the artists spontaneous and unaccountable stream of invention. There is no explanation of the undoubted fact that Kahlo was part of the Global Surrealist diaspora. No clue as to the influence upon her imagery of such painters as Paul Delvuax, Rene Magritte , Dorothea Tanning and Giorgio DeChirico. No hint, therefore, that her work was part of a global movement, rather than being simply some idiosyncratic flash in the pan. These influences on Kahlo are immediately apparent to anyone familiar with those artists' work, but to others not so versed some indication of that influence is needed if we are to see what she painted in context. If we are to understand, for example, that she may be seen as having taken the techniques of Surrealism and applied them to a very different sense of the ""subconscious"" and the ""mind"" than had it's mainly Francophone, mainly male, originators. Otherwise it appears, as I say, unaccountably idiosyncratic, arbitrary, solecistic and perverse. We are given no sense of Kahlo's mental landscape, her intellectual concerns or her taking on such issues. Nothing to indicate that, in fact, her art makes that of husband Rivera the ""genius"" seem plodding, dullard and dated. There is no real attempt to address the possibility that Kahlo was a talented and intelligent woman over-shadowed by an egoistic oaf. We are not even given any hint that she had an intellectual landscape or indeed anything going on in her head apart from lust and jealousy! And even this is treated in a trivialising and prurient ""lesbian-romp"" style.Instead of any such guidance or context, what we are treated to is a collection of visual gags, tricks and tromp-loel animations of selected images that serve only to sprite up the story and divert our attention from the virtual absence of the real paintings. This is the stuff of pop-video's rather than any serious attempt to understand an artist. The very nadir is reached when a foolish cavalcade of cut-and-paste images lifted from various paintings rolls across the screen in advertisement of the directors absolute lack of understanding of visual art. You cannot divorce a detail of a painting from the rest and expect it to still equal the whole.Faint attempts to show the continuous influence of physical pain upon Kahlo's iconography are undermined by the fact that said pain is occasionally referred to but almost not shown at all. Kahlo here never once actually looks like she has so much as a headache, let alone persistent ischemic and anatomical agony as a result of dozens of simultaneous fractures and tissue damage caused by being smashed to bits in a collision and impaled by a three foot steel bar! We are notified that this is the case. It is stated. But we are not given any real sense that the character we see is actually experiencing the persistent aftermath of such a trauma. Through most of the film she appears to be just swell! As happy as Larry! Tip top old bean. Only near the end do we see a few winces and a bit of a stagger appear. Yet we are told that the pain is omnipresent and we know that her paintings dwell on this. So why does this director so utterly fail to show us anything that connects the facts with the depiction! There is nothing here to disavow me of my suspicion that Kahlo has been given such extensive attention as she has received in the past twenty years merely on account of her being (a) a woman in a man's world ( that of latino machismo and revolutionary artists ) and (b) one of the few well known artists from the ""third world"". There was nothing here to contradict my suspicion that the attention accorded this artist has largely been lead by feminists and leftist revisionaries on the basis of what they would like Kahlo to have been rather than what she actually managed to be.I would have liked to have discovered otherwise. But I did not discover otherwise by watching this movie.",Frida

Her work is shown everywhere and there's hardly anyone who does not recognize it at first glance. I'm sure Salma Hayek wanted this to be a movie worthy of the artist, since it's a project she wanted to do for many years, but if you ask me, it's no better than the best mexican films of the last years.I thought Salma would put her heart into playing her favorite artist in the big screen but it doesn't seem like it, and if she did, then maybe she's not such a great actress as I had believed. I think Alfred Molina outdid her every minute of the film. I loved his performance as Diego Rivera. He makes you like him and hate him at the same time. The rest of the cast did very well too in their almost-cameo appearances: Edward Norton, Geoffrey Rush, Ashley Judd, Valeria Golino (where were you all these years?), Patricia Reyes and Margarita Sanz (whoa! even with no lines she says everything with her look). The animated paintings and their relation to Frida's reality are also a big plus to the story.I think this movie is Salma's last chance to succeed in Hollywood. If it works it will be a big breakthrough for her, if it doesn't she will remain one of the many latin actresses trying to get a slice of the big cake.All in all, ""Frida"" is a good movie, but rather than saying ""could"", I say it ""should"" have been better.",Frida
92,spazmodeus,Really pretty good!,9,27 June 2003,"As someone hates mainstream movies that pose as independent, ""outsider"" work, I have to say that I didn't hate this. Actually, I quite liked it. Sure, the movie didn't really take any risks, and the story itself is interesting enough that it didn't have to, but what I think I appreciated the most is that it wasn't a morality tale. At no point did I feel preached to, though there were ample opportunities. In general, I have to grudgingly admit that this was quite well done. Again, as someone who hates mainstream movies posing as independents, I'm not capable of higher praise.",Frida
93,MatBrewster,Visually Stunning,7,3 May 2005,"When Frida was released into theatres I had absolutely no desire to see it. I'm neither a fan of Salma Hayek, biopics in general, and biopics about artists especially. Add to that my zero knowledge about the artist Frida herself and the movies fate was sealed into never being seen by the likes of me. However, my general lack of new movies here in France and being able to borrow it from a friend for free helped me to reconsider watching it. When I realized it was directed by Julie Taymor who also directed a marvelously beautiful version of Titus then I was actually excited by it (almost).Like Titus, Frida is an amazingly visual movie. Taymor, who is known mainly for her Broadway adaptation of the Lion King, has an artists eye for visual flair. She has found away to take something as static as a painting and made it alive. Throughout the film she recreates several of Frida's works and makes them a part of the action. It's impossible to explain on paper (or cycberspace) but what she creates is something pure magic.I can't say how accurately Frida is portrayed in this movie. The picture we get is of a rather flawed woman who lived with a great deal of suffering. Her suffering comes in both physical ways (stemming from an accident early in life) and emotionally (from a cheating husband and her own mistakes). Yet it is this suffering that creates such remarkable art. Taymor manages to create an interesting and moving story within her excellent images.Both Salma Hayek and Alfred Molina pull out excellent performances. I was especially impressed with Molina portraying the very flawed and yet sympathetic Diega. I had pretty much written this actor after playing Doc Oc in the highly overrated Spiderman 2. But here he shows a real sensitivity to his character. Don't be fooled by the billing of this film. The cover of the DVD would have you believe that Ed Norton, Antonio Banderas, Ashley Judd and Geoffrey Rush all star in it. In fact, with the exception of Geoffrey Rush, all of them have more or less cameos in the picture. Rush is in the movie a bit more, but I wouldn't call even that a starring role.",Frida

95,smoothhoney1265,Outstanding!,10,4 April 2005,"Usually, when you see a biopic about a famous artist and genius you either get to see a tragic, suffering creature or an idealized God. And often it's always the same: He/she was born, had a difficult childhood, created some masterpieces, had some affairs (usually with actors/actresses or/and musicians) and dies a sad and lonely death. But what a refreshing difference ""Frida"" was! Frida Kahlo's life was more suffering than joy, yet the movie does not pity her all the time but shows Frida's lust for life, love, art and her husband Diegor Riviera.It tells the story of a really unusual life: When Frida is a student, young, beautiful, full of live and in love with a gorgeous boy (Diego Luna from ""Y tu mama tambien"" and ""Dirty Dancing  Havanna Nights) she experiences a horrible accident when her bus crashes with a tram. Frida then becomes a cripple for the rest of her life, but through this she experiences herself in a new way and starts to paint, mostly self-portraits where she deals with her pain, her family, political situations and people she loves. Soon after the accident a miracle happens: Frida learns to walk again and the first thing she does is to visit the famous artist and painter Diego Rivera to ask his opinion about her paintings  the beginning of an unusual and often complicated love story that should last a lifetime.We get to learn a woman who experiences so many tragic things in life that it should be enough to commit suicide, yet she never gives up, grows stronger and one thing that certainly helps her through hard times is her wit, her dignity and her love for life and art. She takes what she wants and needs (which also includes love affairs with men and women) but has also a lot to give. Plus her works, so honest, brutal but also beautiful in their truth, reveal one of the greatest talents of our time.A whole lot of this movie works of course through its female protagonist, whose role is not that easy and a real challenge sometimes. The wonderful and graceful Salma Hayek, who is immensely gifted, does really great work here and awakes Frida and her world to life again. Hayek perfectly holds the balance between triumphs and losses, joy and sorrow, madness and daily routine, life and death. She is just a pleasure to watch, she doesn't play Frida, she IS Frida. Another important character is of course Diego Rivera, the greatest love of Frida's life. Alfred Molina, a great British actor, is perfectly casted for this role and besides, has a remarkable resemblance to the real Diego. Outstanding performances also by the supporting cast: Valeria Golino, Ashley Judd (with a great imitation of the Mexican accent), Geoffrey Rush and Edward Norton.Frida  a feast for the senses full of life and exploding emotions and a tribute to a truly unique and remarkable woman, who was the greatest female artist of the last century!",Frida

The final act did draw me in though).  I liked the acting, the sets, and some of the ""artistic moments"" were great while a handful didn't really work.  And it should have been shot in Spanish!!! I bet the real Frida would have backed me up on that.  She must have been an amazing woman, and I think she deserved to have her story presented through a much more interesting script.",Frida
97,FedRev,A bio-pic about the relationship between art and politics,9,15 February 2015,"Frida is a bio-pic about the surrealist Mexican painter Frida Kahlo. The film details her early artistic aspirations and the way she met her husband, the famous painter Diego Rivera. We also witness the horrific accident that left Frida in pain for the rest of her life, and her development as a master artist while living in the shadow of her husband's fame. The film is uniquely stylized, literally bringing her paintings to life on screen, allowing the audience to connect the narrative to the artwork. But the greatest thing about Frida is the way it handles the politics involved, both in terms of social relationships, as well as treating Kahlo and Rivera's communist views with dignity and respect. The film doesn't celebrate their art while condemning their radical politics, as it easily could have in the wrong hands. Rather, it's a celebration of the relationship between the two. Frida is ultimately a film about how politics informs and flows through art. Salma Hayek gives a career defining performance as the radical painter, and Julie Taymor directs this wonderful film with a vision that takes the story to great heights.",Frida
98,Harrismh,"Frida is a huge film that would be bigger than life, except that it is true life.",10,24 November 2002,"SPOILER************SPOILER***********SPOILERFrida tells the extraordinary story of the great Mexican artists Diego Rivera [Alfred Molina] and wife Frida Kahlo [Selma Hayek].  Set in the bohemian culture of Mexico City between the wars [1920's and 30's] Rivera was an unabashed communist and habitual womanizer.  Frida adopted the former but would not tolerate the latter; the couple was married twice.  Rivera became internationally famous and traveled to `gringo landia' for exhibits, where the Rockefellers commissioned his work.  The couple took NYC by storm, like King Kong and Fay Wrey.  Back in Mexico City they were landlords to Leon Trotsky when he was exiled from the USSR.  Frida was tormented with pain from a childhood accident and died a painful death at a young age.
Frida is a huge film that would be bigger than life, except that it is true life.  The movie looks and feels like Evita [1996] the rock opera about Eva Peron and The Cradle Will Rock [1999] the story of WPA funded artists and politics in NYC during the Great Depression.  Memorable scenes abound in this film.  Take the one where Frida and Leon Trotsky visit the Pyramids of the Sun and Moon [outside Mexico City] and Trotsky reminisces about his murdered children, while both sit atop a pyramid.  Or perhaps, John D. Rockefeller Jr. [Edward Norton] pleading with Rivera to remove a likeness of Lenin from a mural in the lobby of Rockefeller Center.  Diego refuses and Rockefeller has men attack the wall with air hammers.
Frida has Academy Awards written all over it; not just one or two, but almost any category that you choose.  This story is a real life epic perfectly captured by the movie; romance, love and politics.  The screenplay is a period masterpiece with costumes, scenes, sets and a music score to match.  The cinemagraphic interpretations and transitions are unusual and expressive.  That just leaves Selma Hayek and Alfred Molina who are certain nominees for Best Actor and Best Actress.  These two do not just `play' their parts; they assume the characters personas.",Frida
99,yaaah_69,"A GREAT TANGO OF LOVE,PAIN AND SEXUAL FREEDOM!",9,3 November 2002,"One thing I do not like is comparing a book to the movie that is based on the book. For one thing, they are two very different art forms. And hardly ever, will the Twain meet. And that is a good thing. Frida is an amazing collage of one of the most fascinating artists, sexual and political women of our time. Like many others her paintings, at first repulsed me, but after reading excerpts from Herrera's biography on Frida- ( which is bogged down on the love letters and love making, with hardly a comment on the political and national turmoil of the times),- one could see why the painting's were so full of sorrow and life defying pain. Frida lived in some very volatile times the revolution in Russia with Trotsky living in her house. Her husband and mentor and much admired muralist Diego Rivera going to New York, commissioned to paint a mural for Rockefeller and painting Lenin as one of the struggling workers. When asked to remove Lenin from the painting, he refused and Rockefeller tore the mural down. It was a time of great nationalism and the struggle to stop the European influence in Mexico.Many kudos' to Selma Hayek for her devotion to this biopic. I was very concerned that it could not be done, but it has been done and a great job. There's got to be some Oscar nominations out of this beautiful movie. The vivid colors and the musical score are in themselves worth the trip to see this great movie. The two main characters, Salma and Molina fit as a pair of gloves and waltz around each other as honeybees around a bright red poppy. If you miss this movie you will have missed one of the best biopic's ever.ciao yaaah69 I give it a 4/5",Frida
100,bootlebarth,Artists behaving badly,6,31 July 2008,"Distilling a life to a two hour film is a challenge. Nearly all the detail has to be lost. Incidents must be selected, linked and presented in a manner likely to appeal to the cinema-goer. Many of the scenes shown can be no more than imaginative reconstructions, some because there is no record of what actually happened, and some because the director prefers not to let truth get in the way of a more potent image.Frida Kahlo was a Mexican painter. An attack of polio in childhood left her with a limp, and a near-fatal traffic accident later made her frequently bed bound and in almost constant pain. She married Diego Rivera, famous for his murals, revolutionary posturing and philandering. For most of her life Frida was artistically in the shadow of her husband, ex-husband and remarried husband. In her last year she had her one and only solo exhibition in Mexico, but her reputation as an artist and feminist have grown since her death in 1954.All biopics are blends of fact, fiction and style. The overall tone may be hagiography or character assassination. Significance may be attributed to events of little importance, and those that really mattered may be overlooked. The standards by which an biopic should be judged are uncertain.Considered as a free-standing story, Frida stumbles along rather like its protagonist. Mostly what we see are artists behaving badly. The rows and infidelities aren't very interesting. I've rarely been less emotionally involved by a cinematic depiction of a relationship. The romance, recriminations and occasional remorse are tedious rather than tear-jerking. The biographical elements have to include some of the key events of Kahlo's unlucky and messy life. An early scene in which adolescent Frida bonks her boyfriend in a cupboard, from where they tumble in a state of partial undress smacks of artistic licence. So does the crippling accident, which ends with an elegantly prostrate Frida being showered with gold flakes as she waits for an ambulance.We are spared the suffering and numerous surgeries Frida endured throughout a lengthy convalescence during which she developed her idiosyncratic painting style. The early days of her relationship with Diego are reconstructed with the kind of Hollywood gloss that is only to be expected. Sketches of life are given in improbable domestic and social scenes involving tequila-slugging, fights, dirty dancing and more.The famous business of Rivera's commissioned mural at the Rockefeller Centre is, of course, included. Picking up the generous crumbs (that had been rejected by Picasso and Matisse) from an exceedingly rich man's table, Rivera included a portrait of Lenin in his design. The presence of such a famous anti-capitalist face went down like a cup of cold sick. Exit inflexible Diego and down with the wall.Another vital ingredient is Rivera's fling with Frida's sister Cristina. This dalliance and others were said to mean nothing by Diego, who claimed to attach no greater importance to fornication than to urination. Frida, initially presented as a loyal and faithful wife, subsequently romps with, among others, a dusky parisienne chanteuse and, back in Mexico, Leon Trotsky before his head was holed by an assassin's ice-pick. Time eventually catches up with Frida, who mainly seems as comfortable and agile as any normal person. First she loses some gangrenous toes. Later we realise that she's lost half a leg as she struggles with Diego for possession of this prosthetic limb.Directorially, Frida is gimmicky and disjointed, perhaps in deliberate imitation of her painting style. The design, costumes and locations are impressive enough, but do we really need the animated skeletons, the cartoonish journey to New York and the reconstituted excerpts from King Kong with Diego substituting for the mighty ape? Worst of all are the musical interludes. In case we forget the Mexican setting, there are several appearances by sombrero-clad guitarists.Salma Hayek as Frida sports a reasonably convincing monobrow but lacks the mini- moustache, widely recognised in Mexico as a sign of feminine beauty, of the real Frida. Alfred Molina as Diego is said to have added 23 kilos of blubber around his jowls and waistline for the role. Let's hope he enjoyed all those tortillas and managed to unload the excess baggage afterwards. Geoffrey Rush as Trotsky looks glad to be heavily made up and hides behind an eastern European accent of uncertain location. He looked more uncomfortable in all of his scenes than Salma Hayek did in any of hers, even those involving plaster casts and body braces.Perhaps the greatest weakness of Frida is the screenplay, produced by a team of six writers and then overhauled by Edward Norton, Hayek's squeeze at the time and player of a minor part in the film. The dialogue clunks horribly. It is as wooden as Frida's artificial leg.Back to artistic licence. The film starts with bed bound Frida being loaded onto the back of a truck. Towards the end we see where she's going. Diego is giving a mawkish oration about the genius of his sickly wife at the opening of the only solo exhibition she had in Mexico during her lifetime. In rolls the bed with Frida wittily obeying the doctor's orders not to leave it. In 1954 the bed was, indeed, sent to the exhibition but Frida's arrival was more mundane. She travelled by ambulance and was carried into the gallery on a stretcher.In the end Frida falls into the biopic trap. It departs too much from the truth to be of real interest as a historic account, and it binds itself too closely to awkwardly linked key events to have the engaging flow of a good story.",Frida

However, a more objective look will reveal that not only Frida the movie sucked; but so Frida, the person portrayed, herself. Especially as an artist. Her life story feels more like a bad TV movie of the week. Yes; it's sad what happened to her. But so what? A lot of other folks had it tougher out there, and you don't see them claiming their 15min of fame or their remaining heir's movie making deals. Why do I have to care about these overrated morons in the first place? I know; because Hollywood told me to. Better stated; their bourgeois friends, whether still living, or otherwise. Nevermind that's an excuse for a liberal gloryfest.- Well, there you go; I guess that's the reason this wasn't made into a film before. It's simply uninteresting. Even the supposedly racy issues. There's nothing I found controversial. I actually wish there was something; that would have make it less boring. I just didn't care for her romances; I found her art void, insipid, infantile, unmoving, overrated and lame; since she couldn't draw better that a 5yo. Also I thought her decisions were stupid, and by extension, so her overall existence. Bias notwithstanding, the only other group that overall liked it were mexicans; unsurprisingly. Sheeple that had some epiphany about her art or liked this movie experience are obv on some weird peyote stuff. I must admit that as a comedy, this works way much better. I laughed so hard at her misfortunes and stupidity that I almost cried. And after all their marriage was a joke too. As a matter of fact; the most interesting part revolves around the Trotsky murder affair, pun intended. Since this is also as much about Diego as it is about Frida. It makes sense to focus on him; because he was the most recognizable talent of the two. She simply comes of as arrogant, pedantic accessory; and being the greatest thing since the invention of the guacamole. The graphic style of the movie was the main thing that kept me watching throughout. Alfred's performance was adequate; and I most also grant that Selma looked and owned the part too. However, that's not enough in my book to gave it a positive review; merely an extra star. And the accents were bothersome and appalling too; specially of the secondary characters. I also knew right away the movie was never meant to be great since it was done in the English lang, not in Spanish. I mean; how many other Spanish Frida movies are out there; besides documentaries? Zero I think, and for a good reason. In the end, I just couldn't care less who Frida Kalho was before; and now that I know, I just despise her. And that is how powerful the effect this movie had on my perception of her...",Frida

109,soanim8ed,Frida's paintings come to life.,9,13 November 2002,"Julie Taymor really has an eye for beauty, which she has proved in her Broadway version of The Lion King and her first film, Titus.  In Frida, she reigns in her over-blown effects work that set Titus apart, but also set it on the border of overblown.  Here she uses the rich, earth-tones of Mexico and the beautiful pastels of Santa Fe to bring to life the story of artist, Frida Kahlo.Frida is portrayed by Selma Hayek in a eye-opening performance that proves the woman CAN actually act.  This is her vehicle as star and producer, so has made sure to bring all of Frida's modesty, love of art, temper and pain to life to the screen.  She does so with both subtly and with an air of yearning for acceptance within the acting community.  This is not a bad thing as it brings out the qualities of Frida of yearning to be accepted with art that she is convinced only she will like due to their very personal nature.Of course, none of Hayek's attempts would be as good as they are if not for her supporting cast.  Alfred Molina is simply incredible as her communist, self-gratifying husband and comrade in painting, Diego Rivera.  And Mia Maestro gives a sublime performance in the small role of Frida's sister, Cristina.Also supporting the cast is the movie's music.  As much part of Mexican heritage as part of the film, great thought is given to the songs used in the pivotal scenes.  These heighten the emotional level of the film such as the scene where Frida is being sung to in an empty bar after finding Diego cheating with Cristina.But the best part of the film is Taymor's use of special effects to literally bring Frida's paintings to life.  Extraordinary care is given to re-create her paintings as live set pieces.  It's simply amazing.  This is Taymor's element and none are doing it better in film.As the film ends, we witness, through Frida's painting, that Diego has respected her request to have her cremated.  She wants her broken body burned to make sure that she would never have to return to the physical pain and agony that she bravely face through most of her.  A suffering that, had it not happened, may have robbed the world of her inspirational, provocative, original and emotional-twisting artwork.",Frida

There are shades of ""Surviving Picasso"" about it. Yet, this movie transcends the Picasso film on a number of levels. Where ""Surviving Picasso"" is all about Anthony Hopkins masterful performance, ""Frida"" has a chemistry between its leading actors that you just don't see enough of in modern cinema. Yes, Salma Hayek inhabits the character of Frida and makes it entirely her own. But Alfred Molina's portrayal of her overweight, philandering husband really brings this movie to life. History is important to this movie also. Although removed from the turbulent events dominating European politics in the 1930s, Mexico embraces the ideology that will soon tear Europe apart and reflects that ideology in its art. Diego Rivera, as portrayed by Molina, is certainly a greater lover of women and painting than he is of political ideology, but the fact that he plays host to the exiled Trotsky shows that he is willing to put himself in harms way for the sake of his political principles. Trotsky is played charmingly by Geoffery Rush and his introduction to the story sends Diego and Frida's marriage to another level.

115,robertrutledge,"Great, but maybe not particularly memorable",7,29 November 2019,"As far as biopics go, this movie based on the life of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo is quite tasteful. I did not know a whole lot about Frida's life going in, and from what I have read online, it seems as if the movie does a good job at historical accuracy, even if there may be some minor discrepancies. That being said, as a result of watching this film, I now have a desire to learn more about the life and work of the artist.Visually speaking, this movie was very engaging, although at times somewhat awkward or even forced. It's intriguing to see her different paintings throughout the movie (they use Frida's actual paintings) and the circumstances under which they were conceived. She did not by any means live a happy life, having permanently injured her back and pelvis in a trolley accident as a teenager. Her subsequent work as an artist displays these feelings of turmoil and agony. However, her deeply rooted communist beliefs and on-and-off fiery relationship with husband Diego Rivera are what keep her going, both which are of constant influence in her paintings.It would have been nice to have been given a little bit of insight into how she become interested and involved in the communist party. The movie never sheds too much light on this aspect of her life, and at times it feels almost as if the movie is centered around Diego, not her. The dynamic between Frida and Diego is quite entertaining, and from what I've read, accurate to their real-life romance (or lack there-of). The two actors are perfectly cast, Alfred Molina's big burly figure provides a perfect (and once again, accurate) contrast to Salma Hayek's more petite frame. The acting is believable and praise-worthy.This movie is perfect for anyone who wants to know more about the life of Frida Kahlo. It's a story of love and heartbreak, of trust and deceit, and of hope and despair. The genius of Frida lives on today in her paintings, which have stood the test of time. Actress Salma Hayek pays homage to the artist in a fun and playful, yet respectful way. While a solid movie by all means, no scenes in-particular jump out at me, and I still feel that there is a lot more to Frida's complex personality that is not displayed. The best way to develop a relationship with the artist is not by watching this movie, but by actually taking the time to appreciate her mesmerizing art. Regardless, Frita does an excellent job at shedding light onto the extraordinary artist's intimate personal life, offering a brief glimpse into the difficult challenges she had to overcome so that her art may be enjoyed to this day.",Frida

Salma Hayak did an admirable job portraying a very talented and multifaceted woman.  It wasn't however, the most compelling movie of the past year...that distinction goes to Antwone Fisher...but it was nice to watch at least once.  Not a light hearted fare to just have on in the background...this movie demands that you stay riveted until the closing credits.",Frida
117,imdb-5032,Demanding but merciful,8,13 November 2006,"Visually stunning and emotionally compelling, Frida is alternately graceful and gruesome, factual and fantastic, thrilling and chilling. Selma Hayek conveys Frida's iconic image with relish and transcends the typically clichéd Latin temperament. Alfred Molina is irresistible as the charming, philandering artist/husband Diego. Roger Rees delivers a beautifully subdued performance as the loving, struggling father.Striking surrealist segues and overlays provide startling and visceral brushes with the dark and dream-like ""twilight reality"" that also pervades Frida's work. The arbiters of life and death have never been more convincingly portrayed than in the eerie, demon-like skeleton creatures which discuss Frida's condition after the traffic accident. The near-subliminal shimmer of Death in the face of Trotsky's murderer is as unsettling as it is apt.The film can be demanding as it swings vertiginously between suffering, betrayal, and death, but it is never callous and ultimately merciful; both on Frida and on the viewer.",Frida
118,jeclft,Stunning Visuals And Quality Acting,10,14 June 2003,"Salma Hayek pulls out the performance of her life and just to watch her is a treat.

120,Naoum,Viva La Vida,10,9 January 2005,"I believe this movie fulfilled its mission as it was able to ""move"" me! The most profound thing about this movie is that it is able to deliver the most promising message out of a most painful biography.The life of Frida Kahlo is truly inspiring as one can see how a woman can go beyond the pain of life that is inevitable for everyone to experience (maybe in smaller or bigger doses) and find the joy and passion for life. This piece of art made me ponder on how we can have it all and still not be satisfied with life. Here is a woman who has lost her body integrity and has more life in her than... me! I can imagine why any man would fall in love with such a passionate woman as Frida! A story of pain... and yet out of pain the most gentle heart can flourish. I loved the music and the presentation of Frida's art which was done with respect and never taking more room than it was appropriate.Bravo and... VIVA LA VIDA!",Frida
121,Red66,"Not a great film, but worth a look",7,17 November 2002,"The main reason to see Frida is for the great art direction; some really fresh stuff happening in that arena. Expect Ocars nods for sets, art direction and costumes. Salma Hayek has two or three great moments, but for most of the film my impression was, ""Look how excited Salma is to be playing Frida."" Unlike Angela Bassett in ""What's Love Got to Do With It"" and Jessica Lange in ""Frances"" Hayek never crosses that line in which she becomes Frida. Geoffrey Rush is memorable, while Ashley Judd struggles with her accent (why was she cast in this film?). The script is weak and the dialogue almost embarrassing at times. Ms. Hayek is incredibly beautiful, sexy and charismatic, but is unable to portray the complexities of the main character. She has spent so much time cultivating her celebrity and it shows here. She seems to be thinking more about what she is going to wear to the Academy Awards than channeling the daily pain brought on by Frida's wrecked body. However, ""Frida"" is not a total waste of money and I imagine far superior to the version Madonna would have produced, but it is not a great piece of cinema. The film did make me want to learn more about Frida's life though. In that sense, it's a success.",Frida
122,Sean_Thorniley,lusciously divine!,10,20 November 2002,"Frida is a passionately luscious film, just like the woman herself.  Salma Hayek and Alfred Molina are outstanding in all they bring to an already wonderful story that was superbly adapted (too bad Edward Norton doesn't get ""official"" credit for the final draft).  One of the more beautiful films of the last ten years with an outstanding use of music to give an English language ""Spanish"" film its Hispanic heart.  What I loved most about this fine work was not just the story of several interesting folk, but how delectable our journey is as  we learn about them and the juxtaposition of the subtleties and  meretriciousness of  the personalities;  art, politics and passions of the two main characters.  One the best edited films of all time and much of the reason the story sucks you into it.  Yes, there are ""sex scenes"", but they are not only warranted by the story, but beautifully crafted like the painting of the artists and even those who are not fond of sex scenes shouldn't be offended.  This was also one of the few films I have ever seen where the entire audience clapped at the end and then began to discus it for some time.  A must see if you love the medium of film and would like to see the person who may well be able to replace Kubrick!",Frida
123,zena-1,compare this version to previous film,7,3 June 2007,"While I am a great fan of Alfred Molina and Salma Hayek is undoubtedly convincing as Frida, I urge viewers to look out for the earlier version in which Ofelia Medina played the title role. Ofelia Medina portrays Frida's fragility even more convincingly and don't be afraid that the earlier film is in Spanish(with a little French and Russian) and no subtitles! There is in fact only limited dialogue and after seeing the 2002 movie, is quite easy to follow. Both ladies do an excellent job of interpreting this fascinating character and both films are well worth viewing as they give some insight into the turbulent events of the early twentieth century in Mexico.",Frida

I was not sure that I would even like this film, but I did.  I watched it on DVD, so I was able to see the bonus features on the second DVD disc.  It was easy for me to see the effort Ms. Hayek put into bringing this project to life from just watching her performance.  I hope this project is the first of many where Ms. Hayek's passion and conviction is displayed for all to see.",Frida
126,daycmane,Very well executed!,9,3 July 2020,"So I've seen this movie many times because I really enjoy everything about it.
This movie was able to give life to that wild fire inside Frida. Although Selma still looks stunning in the movie, I could really see Frida in her and I can't imagine a better fit for the role.
The movie will take you to Frida's teenage years, when her big accident happened and follow her path from there, her development as an artist, a little bit of her story as an activist, her troubled romance with her fellow artist Diego Rivera, and one of the things that I like the most is that it shows the creative process and what inspired her most famous pieces. The music is another aspect that I absolutely adore in this amazing film.
As a foreigner living in Mexico I was actually surprised to see that a lot of people here don't really like this movie, in fact they don't really like Frida that much, but I still think that it's because she was just so ahead of her time and she would still be ahead of her time if she was alive. She lived by her own rules and that was not acceptable by most people with strong beliefes and traditions.
Knowing this, I respect this movie even more because they were able to portray that Frida always felt different, always felt like she didn't belong. I highly recommend it.
The only thing I don't like about the movie is that they focused a bit too much on Diego at times. Yes, he was a very important part of her life, but it focused a bit too much on his art and his issues at some point, but the name of the movie is Frida Kahlo, not Frida and Diego.",Frida
127,BumbleBoo,"Fantastic movie, great direction",10,24 March 2003,"I saw this film last night not knowing anything about it or the central character in the history of art. It was an amazing film and true to the word I was seduced by the fine acting of Selma Hayek and Alfred Molina and of course the true story of these larger than life characters. The direction was excellent and the photography breathtaking. The vibrant colours and wonderful costumes were overwhelming. The fine acting was not limited to the central characters for the supporting cast too were wonderfully portrayed. I cannot recommend this film too much.

I also know that Selma Hayak is a babe, and I know a lot about her breasts. Among the things I don't know: what Kahlo's relation to women was; how she learned to paint; what painters she admired; what her relation to the 'revolution' was; what the relation was between suffering and art. I am left to imagine how this absolutely perfect body on which the camera dotes so obsessively could possibly contain the pain it is supposed to harbor (every forty minutes or so the director reminds us of this). But then, I get a really cool lesbian-dancing scene, which I suppose was more important than any of this trivial stuff. And did I mention the boobs?",Frida
130,Epaminondas,"Not a flawless film, but visually and musically moving",7,2 January 2005,"This film retraces the life and art of the Mexican artist Frida Kahlo, along with her intense love story with fellow painter Diego de Rivera. The film has major flaws, among which an endless repetition of breaking up/reconciliation scenes between the lovers, and most of all a hilarious episode where Frida and Leon Trotski become romantically entangled on the top of an Aztec pyramid. Though accurate enough in historical terms, the performance of Geoffrey Rush as the great-intellectual-revolutionary-in-exile is so poor, and the filming is so ludicrous as to make these twenty or so minutes utterly laughable.All that said, the film is definitely worth viewing, for the following reasons:-It has one of the most beautiful scores composed for the screen since the death of Georges Delerue. Elliot Goldenthal has created a fascinating, enthralling series of themes that constantly underline and accompany Frida's art and interior state of mind, opening up realms of emotion and reflection for the spectator. He blends Mexican folk music with metaphysical interrogations and flamboyant, radiant sparks of happiness to create an unforgettable music. It should also be mentioned that Caetano Veloso sings the superb 'Burn it Blue' as title song, and that the great Mexican artist Chavela Vargas makes a moving appearance as la Llorona - the crying woman.-Director Julie Taymor does a fine job of presenting Frida's art by shifting from real-life sequences to paintings and back effortlessly and with great visual grace. The film is the best possible introduction to F and Diego's paintings. Moreover, some sequences, as that of the bus wreck (which would leave Frida lame), are of a great formal beauty. In this crucial scene the flying gold flakes, broken glass, and contorted anguished face of Frida create a scintillating shot of true emotional depth. It announces that Frida's life will be marked by pain and beauty forever blended.-The performance of Salma Hayek is superb. One can feel her investment in his project, and she manages both to lend the historical Frida an added bodily beauty that captures viewers's minds; and to act the more difficult scenes of sickness, agony and despair with restrained grace and talent.Thus, despite its serious defects, this movie contains very strong emotional, visual and musical experiences, scarce seen on today's screens.",Frida

And this is coming from a person who do absolutely do not believe in anything she does.But that's, little by little, as you go along in the movie, is put aside and you enjoy being and living her life because she is so strong and determined to go thru.The movie really puts her on a pedestal. I don't know if she was so good and perfect, but her paintings are really well represented. They has this ""Dalli"" Feeling about them. This feeling that painters have...

137,stuit,A nice looking gossip column,2,7 April 2003,"This film could pass as a made-for-network-TV biopic of Frida Kahlo. Underneath all the pretty imagery, there's very little there.  It looks nice - the film displays some well done imagery, just like Julie Tamor's other film, ""Titus"".  Unfortunately, the imagery doesn't support any meaningful expression.  The characters in this story are paper thin.  The film provides no insight into their politics, relationships, or why they ""must"" paint.When Rivera has his famous confrontation with Nelson Rockefeller, he declares that he ""must stand by his principles.""   Up to that point, the film has never introduced us to any of Rivera's principles, or whether he had any principles at all.There is a lot of reference to Frida Kahlo's pain after the trolley accident, but no insight into how this may have influenced her life and art. In fact Selma Hayek rarely shows Kahlo as being in pain at all, unless it's convenient to the story line.This movie felt like the film makers expected us to be impressed by all of the already well-known details of Frida Kahlo's life:  her accident, her relationship with Rivera, her art, her various affairs with Leon Trotsky, and others.  So what?  Without any insight into why these events are important, there is little to this film other than gossip.",Frida

As a bio, as drama, and as art it's all top-notch.  Hayek boldly embodies Kahlo and, amazingly, trancends all impersonation.  Her character is so real and sensual that despite being up on the screen I felt I was able to smell her breath and even touch her skin.  Among the rest of the terrific cast I was especially impressed by Valeria Golina as Diego Rivera's ex-wife.",Frida
139,shekhoosraja,"A lively, well depicted biography",8,2 April 2008,"This movie is the depiction of the life of Frida Kahlo, a painter by heart for most of her life and by profession later on. It starts with showing her as a jolly school girl who faces a severe accident which restricts her to bed for a few months. Confined, Frida takes up painting to pass time at first, but soon chooses this as her way of living. She seeks the guidance of a painter named Diego Rivera who has 'Incurable Infidelity' and hard stamped Socialist views. They soon fall in love and marry. With 2 divorces and an array of continuing love affairs, Diego is not much of a husband. But he surely proves to be Frida's best friend. Despite their differences and a couple of separations, they get back to each other. Diego's socialist views drive his life leading to a disagreement with John Rockefeller and giving refuge to a socialist leader from Russia. Meanwhile Frida's art gets noticed and she gets booked for some exhibitions internationally. Her paintings get known for their originality and honest depiction of pain. Pain slowly gets best of Frida and she dies of illness. Diego stays with her to the very end. The best aspect of the movie is that it focuses on the physical life of Frida. Her handicaps, her pain, her sex life. This lends a brilliant flow and feel to the movie. Moreover, art works of Frida Kahlo are imaginatively used to create transitions and abridged sequences.",Frida

Salma Hayek does a fine job considering her character was shallowly written and not moving in the slightest. The only believable character in the whole movie was Edward Norton who was actually on screen for maybe 3 minutes. I found myself checking my watch hoping for it to be over. However great the story is, the movie completely screwed it up. The only thing I kept thinking was how incredibly strange the script was and wondering when it was over. I think that this story could have been done in so many ways that would have been moving and emotional. Instead you just keep thinking 'what a nut! is this over yet?'

144,amigoPaulo,shallow portrayal of an artist during revolutionary times,6,27 December 2002,"`Frida' is a shallow and almost mono-chrome rendition of an extraordinary colorful person living in revolutionary times.  Unfortunately, the film is focused on the personal tribulations of Frida and the serial infidelities of her husband, Diego Rivera.  Both artists aren't placed within the exciting cultural revolution that engulfed Mexico pre-WWII.  Great artists don't appear in a vacuum, but depend on a nurturing culture; this film doesn't even attempt to mention such context.The film goes from one personal drama involving Diego to another.  The focus is their relationship and Frida's personal tragedy involving her disabilities.  Both artists are short changed - giants in real life boxed into a small frame.  However, a redeeming feature of the film is the stellar acting of the Frida & Diego roles.  With such a cast and great theme, so much more could have been achieved by throwing in some more historical or cultural context.  It is also a shame that the film was produced in English; why can't an audience be assumed to be mature or literate enough to read a few subtitles?  Mexicans may rightly barf at the portrayal of their artists and this particular slice of history.One is also struck at the liberties the script took in portraying Frida's life.  Frida having an affair with Trotsky?  Where did they get this irrelevant snippet?  Oh yes, Frida may have had some homosexual escapades. The film makes a big deal of this.",Frida
145,Nickmac11,"Visually stimulating, but rest is flawed",8,12 June 2003,"The sets and costumes for Frida are beyond imaginative, and the use of Frida's paintings to show her emotions was a great idea, and it works very well.On a whole, this was not a bad movie. But it was far from excellent. Salma Hayek does give a good performance (Not Oscar worthy) as does Alfred Molina (Who, ironically, IS Oscar worthy). The problem comes with some minor details and one major cast flaw.My MAJOR complaint about Frida is Ashley Judd: I did not believe her for a second. She never looked, sounded or acted (If you can act) mexican. Ever. The other complaint is that as harsh and terrible as Frida's life had to have been, the film never portrays it that way. I should not want to live in Frida's world after seeing this movie, but I did. She has a great house, wonderful friends and ideas, but her life is that of pain and sorrow and grief, something we never get from Hayek.The score is fantastic, and Burn It Blue gave me chills.

I must admit that I was attracted to Frida's ""short-haired"" look, or maybe Ms. Hayek is just magnificently beautiful regardless of what she does to herself (I am not sure Frida Kahlo looked that good in life) I thought the film should have brought more of Frida's lovers into play.

The most electric scene of the movie for me was the tango. Salma became Frida for me at that moment. Mr. Molinas was wonderful as Diego, and it was fun to see Antonio Banderas and Edward Norton pop up to steal a scene or two (although in the case of Mr. Banderas, one wouldn't understand the point of his being there without some prior knowledge of the historical situation) Finally, the relationship between Frida and Trotsky. . .well, it's still a mystery to me.

Moreover after seeing this movie I was ""stimulated"" to look for more things about Frida and other painters.

153,ssparling,Salma Hayek is terrific,7,4 January 2004,"This is a breakthrough film for Salma Hayek.  She is terrific as Frida, the 20th Century Mexican artist whose bold art and passion for life was only matched in intensity by the physical difficulties she faced in life.Hopefully this role will enable Hayek to capture more serious scripts in the future.  To date, she had been cast in ""look how pretty I am"" roles that featured her considerable physical beauty rather than her acting prowess. Here, she is convincing as the complex Frida and demonstrates a real range as an actress.  Her performance comes at a time when Hollywood could really use a beautiful actress who can actually act.The film itself is beautifully shot and manages to capture early-20th Century Mexico in a romantic way.  The communist party subplots are amusing, particularly in our post-communism world.",Frida
154,alexismith1,"After watching Frida, I am more in awe of her, more inspired by her story, and more mystified by who she was.",8,5 March 2017,"Frida will always hold a special place in my heart. This film resonates with everyone in one way or another as it depicts the complex mixture of pain and beauty we all grapple with in life. Director Julie Taymor, best known for directing the stage show The Lion King, was brought on to this film in 2001 and it was a long time coming. In the late 80s, attempts of making a film about Frida Kahlo had failed as she was deemed 'unknown' and therefore her story, irrelevant. In the early 90s one of her self portraits was bought for $1.5million, the most any painting of Latin American origin had ever been sold for; this increased the value of her story and so many big names in Hollywood were voicing their intentions to make her biopic. The market was saturated with Frida, so nobody was interested until the hype died down and eventually Frida was made in 2002. I find it fascinating how money gives value to someone's story. Surely the story should speak for itself. Luckily for us, the film was made and the masses could connect with this tragic tale, lived nearly a century prior to it's making. Frida Kahlo (1907-1954) is an icon in feminism today. She didn't conform to gender norms - often wearing androgynous attire and being openly bisexual. Despite so much holding her back (her crippling illnesses, society's expectations of the woman's role, her disgrace of a husband) she flourished in the art world and was loved by critics of her time and today - a career driven woman. Her surrealist self portraits were unique and unlike anything else of it's time - a reflection of Frida herself. Painting was a way of expressing the anguish she felt, a victim of life, and her way of fighting back. She was a true fighter. What is striking about this powerful woman is that her vitality and spirit was never shattered, after a lifetime of being knocked down she never failed to get back up again, figuratively speaking. Fall down seven times, get up eight. I think this is because she had an outlet for her sorrow, somewhere to channel the grief of her very existence - her painting - leaving space in her life for love, joy, happiness, gratitude and forgiveness. Frida, played by Salma Hayek, was a cripple and lived a life of chronic physical pain. Everybody has a disability of sorts holding them back in life, be it physical, mental, emotional, circumstantial... That's why I think her story connects with everyone in some way or another. She is a glowing example of overcoming adversity and thriving, accepting life's grievances and using them as the fuel for your success and fulfilment. This film is needed in today's world, where we glorify perfection and expect 'happily ever after'. Her story is honest, grounded and a relief. The storytelling of the film isn't quite as profound as the story itself. I felt like an observer of her life, as if I was looking at one of her self-portraits trying to understand her state of mind. The film failed to tell the viewer how Frida truly felt and would have been better with a slower pace and more moments of quiet reflection and symbolism, as opposed to animation. I think that would have been a more honest portrayal of her state of mind and would have resonated with the viewer on a deeper level. Despite this, it was a good watch and swings the viewer through her highs and lows in a less delicate yet effective way. The quirky stop-motion animation didn't quite fit the traditional Latin American contextual style of the film; however, it reflected the off- beat protagonist who didn't quite fit in the context of her times. The score was in perfect harmony with the Latin American setting, and in perfect disarray with Hollywood's typical repertoire; it is no wonder it won an Academy Award. Similarly, the set-design, costumes and makeup was a visual masterpiece.After watching Frida, I am more in awe of her, more inspired by her story, and more mystified by who she was.",Frida

Temple of Doom was made nearly 25 years ago (1981, I believe), and I heard that Molina had to gain 25 pounds for the role of Rivera in ""Frida."" Rivera painted some very famous frescoes at our local Detroit Institute of Arts, which were *very* controversial at the time. The story is that Rivera lost 30 pounds working on scaffolds near the ceiling at the (then) non-air-conditioned museum, and there were anti-communist pickets outside the museum all the time he was here. The Rivera murals have since become one of the *treasures* of the Detroit Institute of Arts.If you've never seen the movie, you *must* go rent it. It's terrific. You won't be disappointed.",Frida
156,tarmin,This could have been so much better,5,26 November 2002,"instead the director, in my opinion, botched the movie. And at the end the movie is more about Rivera than it is about Frida and who are all these people dropping off and leaving without any purpose (Banderas and Judd). This is more like a dress-up home movie for Salma Hayek to keep in the drawer than a real motion picture for all to see.",Frida
157,fcrub,Frida Hayek or Salma Kahlo ?,10,26 April 2003,"A great great movie. Salma Hayek was the perfect choice to impersonate Frida Kahlo. Not only because of their amazing likeness (minus the eyebrow line...), but also for the sensitivity and the flamboyant femininity she brings on. Frida was a crippled, Frida was a revolutionary, but, beyond, she was first a woman, a loving woman, a sensuous woman. And the lovely Salma, even much more beautiful than the real Frida Kahlo, knows how to show the too short journey of the Mexican surrealist artist through the pain and the sorrows to the immortality, fueled with an incredible strength and an everlasting love. I will add that the filming and the editing are perfect and that Alfred Molina is an above average Diego Rivera. That's why I give ""Frida"" a 10. I enjoyed my evening, last night... Frida Hayek, Salma Kahlo, I love you !",Frida
158,daphnew,A Visual Feast,10,4 November 2002,"Julie Taymor is a genius. Frida is the most gorgeous work I have seen in years. Solid engaging portrait of Kahlo, Rivera, and how their lives & work entwined. No holds barred - sensual, erotic, and stunning!! Never a dull moment - saw this with a friend 30 years younger than myself and we both loved it, so it plays well to a wide audience.",Frida
159,Marzorati2002,"Frida, you deserve better",6,11 December 2002,"As much as I'd love to give this movie two thumbs up after having read so many books of Frida Kahlo and being a fan of hers, there's no way in hell that I can.  The movie isn't horrid, but it's slightly lackluster and definitely a disappointment from what I was expecting.  Frida was a complicated and intricate woman, which shows in her art.  And her life is definitely the stuff of drama.  But growing a single brow across the forehead and letting a woman be 'hairy' just isn't enough to portray or inhabit this intricate woman.  I know this was a labor of love for Selma Hayek which makes it all the more painstaking to walk away without being able to give it accolades, but I don't think she did Ms. Kahlo justice, nor do I think that she was right or versatile enough to play the role convincingly.  Robert DeNiro as Jake LaMotta, now there's someone that went all the way with a real life human being.  Selma Hayek, although tackling a completely different creature came nowhere close to giving her that authenticity or innner life.  Alfred Molina shows up for the part and does his best, but once again, I kept feeling that there was a better choice out there for Rivera.  Ashley Judd was game to turn in a role, but still, it didn't give the movie what it needed.  I am reminded of 'Henry and June' and the authenticity I felt while watching that picture and I guess that was the same kind of thing I was hoping for here.  Needless to say, it didn't happen.Not a total loss.  If you know nothing of Kahlo and you're not likely to pick a book up and bother reading it, then this movie is definitely worth seeing, just to know about this incredible artist and her existence.  But if you're a Kahlo junkie, stay away, this movie misses the mark by too far.",Frida

161,a0a,Great movie!,10,18 January 2003,"This movie is inspirational, educational, refreshing and passionate, positive, not overly romantic, and most of all, it asks difficult real-life questions in a remarkably recognisable way.  Frida Kahlo's spirit and character may be overly romanticized, but the movie is a good attempt at a biography that tell the story why Frida came to become the woman that painted these very harsh, soft but typically paintings that stick in your mind.  In the end of the movie, Diego, her husband, in a few lines, beautifully resume's her entire artistic being.  I know who Frida is now, and I enjoyed this movie tremendously!Every event you see in this movie is true to her life as we know it, although some things were added to spice up the drama and the links between different scenes.  That is usually a dangerous and difficult road to walk, and some critics may still find it intrusive in this movie, but I have a great appreciation for the way the movie makers have succeeded to keep the story flowing, interesting, and still true to the history events in her life, often trying out new film techniques to generate fantastic images. Although this is not a tremendously expensive special effects movie, some of the images can grab you by the throat, especially if you are familiar with the paintings by Frida Kahlo.  You'll love it and feel that inner tears of joy feeling when you see how her world springs to life!Actor-wise, I think the performances are terrific.  Costume wise great care has been taken to make sure everything looks the way it was in her life. The movie does not shy away from social criticism, does not have marriage 'fixes' like most US movies tend to have, does not shy away to portrait communism as it was, not as what US media has made it.  It's a very positive thinking movie, and it warmed my heart to see it.  It is in my opinion everything a movie should be.I am very glad I saw this movie and it is one to remember!!!",Frida
162,glipzcom,Beautiful Movie Frustrating Reality,7,28 December 2002,"I enjoyed the beautiful cinematography. The way Frida's art was blended into the story was fantastic. And the story gave a strong sense of where her inspiration came from. But as far as a story about a person, her life was not all that intersting to watch on screen. Or let me say not fun.(mild spoilers) The story just tells of how she falls in love with a man who she knows has a problem with fidelity. And she marries him, and then the rest of the movie she suffers because of it. Over and over again she aggonizes over the fact that her husband sleeps with other women and is not a good husband.Its not all that happens but it is the prominent theme. I looked forward to the transitions. But dont think it would have been a story at all if Frida wasnt famous.",Frida
163,whitneyistheone3223,Powerful,9,12 October 2005,"Frida the film is as passionately put together as was the Mexican painter's life; it is also as fraught with frailties as was her body, following the horrific accident in her youth. She lived in pain, and she lived in action. Both these elements are well captured in Julie Taynor's often inventive film, displaying the director's theatrical roots to great effect. But the strengths of the film  and there are many, starting with Salma Hyak's fabulous portrayal  are undermined by weaknesses. Weaknesses the film need not have had. In particular, I am referring to the language of the film, the spoken word. This, I admit, is my special grumble about films that are based on real events: the use of English speaking actors who are made to suggest that they are actually Mexican (or Russian, etc) by feigning a slight accent. Strangely enough, Alfred Molina and Salma Hyek almost get away with it. It's the rest of the cast that doesn't, including Geoffrey Rush in a support role as Leon Trotsky, in exile in Mexico. His accent is so false it is distracting  and I think he'd agree. But I mention him only because he's an Australian actor and well known to us; many others are just as distracting. Here he goes again, I hear you say, warbling on about accents, a detail that is sacrificed for the greater good of the film. Well, I think the greater good of the film is made up of a myriad details and since dialogue is one of the main vehicles for character, accents (and the sound or timbre of the voice) are crucial. But if you are less bothered by this element, and you enjoy biopics of artists, this is as good as they get. As good as Pollock or Basquiat. A trifle long, perhaps because it wouldn't make much sense, or have the same emotional impact, without all the story-points, Frida is nevertheless accessible and (for the most part) gripping, as only true human drama can be. I'm especially grateful that the filmmakers chose to tell her life story primarily through her emotional life, not so much through her art or her medical traumas. That's why the film provides us with ripples of recognition and insight into her humanity. Supported by some great music, design and cinematography, this is a film to feel, not to think about.",Frida

166,mrpancake_2000,ONE OF THE BEST...,10,29 March 2003,"I really loved this movie.  I think it was very close to perfect, with only a few minor problems.  It bothers me people say they don't like this movie because it doesn't chronicle Kahlo's live exactly.  Since I don't know much about her, I didn't really have any expectations.   Salma Hayek was absolutely mesmerizing as Frida, and it seemed she really was her character. I would have LOVED to see Salma Hayek win for FRIDA, but it wasn't really in the cards.  Alfred Molina was spectacular as well, and I would have also enjoyed seeing him win, let alone be nominated.  Supporting (minus Molina, who seemed more of a lead in many ways) characters were strong, but had such small parts I can't really give any critique on their performances.  FRIDA was the most overlooked movie of the year missing out in major categories it should have been nominated for (Supporting Actor, Picture, Cinematography, Screenplay, Direction...).  Julie Taymor did a great job directing this masterpiece, which is cleary a spectacle to the eye as well as to the mind. For the few minor problems, the only one that bugged me was the amount of nudity.  It seemed almost unnecessary at some places, but was still rather tasteful (i.e. not having huge, graphic sex scenes complete with noise...[ahem, Halle Berry, and to a lesser extent, Diane Lane])  This really was probably my favorite movie of the year, along with CHICAGO, but for very different reasons.  This was a great year for movies and a great year for the Oscars as well.  I hope Hayek gets more good work in the future and maybe...a win?",Frida
167,Scoobygang,Awful!!!!,1,3 September 2002,"It's one of the worst movies I've seen in my whole life. If you are clever and if you like good movies, you won't see this ""movie"". Salma Hayek scares with her horrible performance!. Well, there's not much to say about it, except an advice: Don't pay for watching it!!.",Frida
168,John-Searle,A transformative movie,10,9 June 2003,"I avoided this film like the plague, seeing  it unfairly, as a vanity project for Ms. Hayak. I was wrong. There are few films extant that can claim the depth and range of this film. Biographies often have an advantage over fiction in depth of character as true lives obviously have a more accidental scope than even the best drawn characters.  Frida;however, aside from being a fluid and powerful life story of a woman and artist of character in very interesting times is, thanks to Ms. Hayaks exuberent and passionate performance, but more than this. This is a film that is true to art as the affliction and expression of the artist. It truly makes one wish to make ones own artistic yearnings come alive, to make it happen. The cinematography and direction by Julie Taymor are fantastic, walking the shadowy line between effective visualisation and overkill with a deftness that really should be seen. This movie is a visual caress with all of the vibrancy of Khalo's paintings, the contrast of cactus green on the ochre and sienna sand of the Mexican desert and a powerful sensuality that flowers throughout  and makes no apologies for it. Frida is a biography, but it is also a story of people who truly lived and of passion that exists beyond pain. This will move you. I cannot recommend this film more.",Frida
169,lapintiira,Should've had an Oscar nomination for best picture,9,7 May 2018,"What an incredibly beautiful and original film, which highlights Frida's life in a poignant yet fierce manner. The story never strays from her peculiar prospective nor her intense feelings, and it really translates well onto screen. I saw this film after the allegations against Harvey Weinstein came out, where we learned the price Salma Hayek and Julie Taymor had to pay for wanting to produce and direct a female led film in the early 2000's. To them I want to say thank you for your courage, being strong and paving the way for future female artists and filmmakers. Your film is beautiful and women deserve better #metoo",Frida
170,msblue2005,Frida-A woman ahead of her time,10,1 December 2005,"One of the most beautiful, well made films. Nobody could have portrayed Frida Kalho better than Salma Hayek. Original, the acting was magnificent, superb. The era was well portrayed. Frida was a woman ahead of her time, she was an Artist, revolutionary, poet, a woman with passion and conviction. It was a bitter sweet love story. Frida suffered great physical pain in her life and Diego was a man not capable of being faithful to one woman. Diego nurtured her as an Artist and was her muse, without Diego Rivera in her life she might not have pursued painting and she loved him with all her heart and that is why his infidelity hurt her so much. It hurt less to be without him than to be with him. It is a true story about an Artist that endured pain and suffering with moments of joy. Truly an inspiration.",Frida

If you need to have all facts and events laid out in black & white this movie may go over your head. Many people will not ""get it"". It is quite possibly my favorite movie of all time! My wife and I watched it at a local small town theater. You watch it and bump along with the plot quite happy with the story, yet little things keep popping up that you don't quite understand. By the end of the movie, and especially with the last scene, we were totally under the spell of the movie! The movie ended and we were sweating! This director and the actress who played Frida are the primary reasons why the movie works so well.My only regrets about the movie is the same one that I have about many movies. Just a couple of scenes in the movie mean I can't enjoy it with my parents (I'm 46) or my kids.I won't go into the story here. I'm sure there are plenty of other places where you can pick that up.As usual, I posted this review _before_ reading anyone else's.",Frida
172,stevemeister74,Worst Movie Ever Made,1,9 November 2002,"It is totally unbelievable that Salma Hayek would waste so much time in making a movie of this woman's pathetic life. I only saw it because it didn't cost me anything, I snuck into it after ghostship; it only makes me imagine how much more painful the movie could have been had I actually wasted ten dollars on it.  The performance is fine and the sex is hot. The fact is a great movie can be made from a sucky story, and a horrible movie can be made of the greatest story in the world. This had neither: bad music, bad theme, 100% uninteresting.  Me and my friends sat there and made jokes about Frida and her ugly unibrow the entire movie. If you're in the mood to throw away money on a waste of time, or if you're high, go ahead and see it. ""Frida"" is definitely my prediction for worst picture at next year's Rasberry Awards.",Frida

Hayek, whom I don't follow much in movies, is great in the lead role as Frida, a woman who develops an unusual sense of original painting in the style of Salvador Dali (where is HIS bio?)

I can not imagine other actress in this role. I also loved Mia Maestro and Alfred Molina. But the performance that was the most breathtaking, was this one of Valeria Golino. She is a master of acting. I have already seen her in 3 movies, but her filmography is full of titles and I'm planning to watch many movies with her. She is beautiful and supertalented. I love her.

I don't recall her name, but I remember being surprised when I learned that this film was directed by a woman. That got me thinking..... .....its not too often that you see a female director. Nonetheless, the direction of this movie is one of its stronger points, so she obviously did a fantastic job. I think its worth mentioning that this flick has got a lot of quirky camera work- the director of photography was quite instrumental in setting the mood in Frida.

Frida Kahlo was a revolutionary not because of her Sex life but because of her Art. Her Art spoke for the pain in her back, the pain in her heart and the her belief in the people. However none of these thoughts reach the screen instead we get another based on a book trite Bio-pic. Frida is objectified and marginalized into cliches that we can easily dispose of into trash cans. The Film Frida tries to be on par with films such as Polluck or Lust for Life(Van Gogh, Kurt Douglas) which show the passion and reasons why these tortured masters painted the way they did. Instead the audience gets to see a whore, a drunk and empty, deformed characture that is pale in comparison to the real person. Frida was revolutionary because she painted such beauty in a time when everyone copied Picasso, Pop and Polluck. Frida's use of color stands far above her contemporaries. Diego Rivera painted Frescos when no one was. Instead the film choose to show ""You are who you have Sex with instead of the Artist"".

She was brilliant and really made the movie as good as it is.The script kept you intrigued and inspired from the start. The life of Frida Kahlo is great material to work with of course.My one criticism is that I would have liked more information during the movie; like a timeline (eg the old ""three years later"" thing) as I never quite knew when it was all happening.Anyway it has inspired me to go and research more on the life of Frida, so it has obviously moved me.

I think is a great achievement for Salma Hayek not only as an actress but as a producer, she cooked this project with so much care and time that she deserves a big cheer (Maybe all the love she felt for this project and for Frida Khalo made her ease things about her life). As a Mexican guy I can say I feel proud that a story about a so important woman as Frida Kahlo is now been known by the whole world, is all truth? Is it all there? Maybe not but is it that important? I think not. They were making a movie not a documentary if you want to see a biography you should watch history channel. This is a well - crafted film, beautifully shot. Mexico has never looked so beautiful in a film like in this one, is filled with the marvelous Mexican culture, habits and places. The moving paintings are just breath taking and Julie Taymor's direction is good must of the time, I just think that she should have done the same kind of shots and editing through all the film, it gets wild sometimes and others don't. Is not unanimous if you know what I mean, the other bad part is the screenplay, it went for so many screenwriters that it gets confusing and once again is not the same picture all of the time, it's obvious that is not a screenwriter personal project, it has many empty spaces and it falls in the middle part of the film, it starts so well (the streetcar crash is just amazing followed by the shot were Hayek is laying filled with blood and golden dust) then it falls and gets great again at the end.Salma Hayek's performances is strong, maybe not the best performance of the year but she shows with this film that she can be a great actress she just needs time, the strongest part of her acting lays in the point that she really made me believe that she was Khalo and not Salma acting. Alfred Molina is also great as Diego Rivera, the other actors can't make a solid performance because they're almost like cameos, I've read some reviews about the film saying that Ashley Judd is misscasted as Tina Modotti, I think she gives a decent performance. Overall this is a good enjoyable film, with good acting, a great score, and the cinematography, costumes and art direction are just beautiful. Everyone should go and watch it to know a little about this woman's life and work. And maybe you fall in love with Khalo and want to know more about her after this film just like I did.",Frida

Overall I am not impressed with her acting and character. She, or more likely the director, failed to show Frida's ambitions, ideology and pain. We are reminded her having! ambitions through her 30-second dialogs with her father but never explaining what they are. We are reminded that she is in constant pain through her saying that she is a bunch of times but we never see it. She is depicted as a ever joyful, sexy woman, who is not a great artist but a spoiled and radical housewife. The Frida shown in the paintings throughout the movie and the Frida they have created are two completely different persons.

The audience gets to share the highs and lows in her life. In the end, you understand how all these events evolve most beautifully into her art. I can't imagine anyone else to have played Frida Kahlo with such passion and lust for life. Salma Hayek is more radiant than ever. I am sure of one thing - her spectacular performance will earn her an Oscar nomination. Always present in Salma's Frida is her longing for Mexico. Rodrigo Prieto's (Amores Perros) cinematography captures the beauty of the country.Julie Taymor and Salma Hayek have truly succeeded in capturing the essence of Frida Kahlo's art - both visually and emotionally. Frida is not only celebrating the life of Frida Kahlo, it is also a celebration of Mexico. A must see!",Frida
195,MsMf,Salma fantastic and Mexico and Mexicans portrayed positively,9,22 October 2002,"Salma gets to showcase her acting chops finally and does a great job... what she has not been allowed to do on screen before. Hopefully directors and producers will take note.....and Mexico finally gets to shine too. It's rare that you see Mexico and Mexicans portrayed as artists, intellectuals and even trend setters...Who knew? no gangbangers, drug dealers or cheapo stereotypes, no turisty Mexico...the real thing...even the music is great and authentically ""latin""...the vision and artist's perspective is worth it alone",Frida
196,the_wanderer_melmoth,Brilliant and Intense,9,29 April 2006,"People will always argue about the quality and truthfulness of biographical movies. So if you know Frida Kahlo's biography by hard you might find things missing or even misrepresented. But to my mind biographical movies are at least movies and not full and neutral biographies. Beneath that Frida is a magnificent movie - colourful as Kahlo's paintings, intense and painful as her life full of love and hatred and with astonishing pictures and visions. Some selected paintings build the framework of the movie and you'll find some 'key symbols' of her paintings all over. And last but not least with an outstanding Salma Hayek in supposedly her best role ever, and just an other jewel in the small oeuvre of Julie Taymor.",Frida
197,armando_petri,Salma meets Oscar..,10,28 September 2002,"Great film and much better than I expected, Salma Hayek is on her way to an Oscar nod... The cast is impressive and the director Julie Taymor proves again she is a genius!Don´t miss this wonderful film!",Frida
198,ashlaroo_04,"Amazing, Informative Movie!",8,14 November 2006,"For my college art class we were required to watch a movie about an artist and I wasn't very intrigued by the assignment. However, my mind changed after I watched the movie ""Frida"" starring Selma Hayek. This movie was about the famous Mexican Painter Frida Kahlo. Frida was crippled at a fairly young age and was told she would never be able to walk again. However, she perservered and led a life that I was completely entertained by. She marries another Mexican Artist, Diego Rivera and they have an extremely rocky relationship. He is constantly unfaithful, and Frida is bisexual and has some relations with other women. They were both firm supporters of communism. There are lots of twists and turns in this movie, and I would recommend it to anyone.",Frida
199,morris__,An absolute triumph!,10,8 September 2002,"I've seen the movie at the Toronto Film Festival and can claim with no hesitation that it is one of the year's best. Salma Hayek delivers a performance you have to see to believe. She portrays Frida as a woman so full of life that it is infectious. At the core, that's exactly what the movie is about: fighting, keep going, live life to its fullest. Frida is an icon and the movie is successful in portraying that.Julie Taymor's visuals are simply breath-taking. The music, the cinenamtography and the performances simply elevate this movie to a whole new level. I'm sure J.Lo fans will trash it even if they haven't seen it, but the audience at Toronto loved the movie and I think that will be the general consensus. Look out for ""Frida"" to be a dominant participant in the awards season!",Frida
200,subtext,The Film Itself is a Work of Art,10,19 November 2002,"This is the only film I have ever seen that not only captures the life of the artist, but if she was a film maker, could have been made by the artist. It is one thing to tell the story of an artist... it is quite something else to evoke feelings of the artist's work. This could have only been accomplished by not only making a great film, (story,acting, direction, cinematography, editing, etc.), but also by creating the moods of the artist's aesthetic visions. This is the mystery of creativity. The audience at the show I attended applauded.",Frida
201,bwj-1,"Appreciation for fine writing, direction, and cinematography",10,10 November 2002,"It is difficult to convey the sense of real people in a film. The great writing of the screenplay conveys that sense of reality for Frida and Diego, two very powerful people.Impeccable direction and fine cinematography brought that writing to life. The use of special effects added to the overall reality without intrusion.This is one film that I want to see again.",Frida
202,jchicago24,Very real and rivoting...,10,18 November 2002,"Very rivoting this film.  Salma did a superb job and I cannot think of any other actress who would have probably executed this as great as she did...even j-lo. I did not know the story of Frida before.  Regardless, I think this 2:15min film did an excellent job communicating a story, very compelling and very interesting.  Kudos to Taymor (Director) as well the writers.The characters had a lot depth and were developed very succinctly througout the film.  The storyline was not banal instead very dynamic.  Things fell to place as the movie progressed.  Valeria Golino was excellent as supporting actress.  I don't know about the cast for Ashley Judd, though.Regardless, this film is definitely the best film I've seen this year. In fact, this is probably the best I've seen in a couple of years.  I actually sat through the entire 2hours and I bought the soundtrack.Highly recommended.",Frida
203,mermaid7seas,An Oscar contender!,10,2 September 2002,"Salma Hayek is wonderful and should win an Academy Award for her performance in this must-see film. It was screened at the Telluride Film Festival 2002, to a packed & enthusiastic house. Brava to the director, Julie Taymor, too! Fantastic cinematography & editing! Don't miss this one.",Frida
204,rrico,Good Movie,9,20 November 2002,"A good american movie, with a mexican approach to Frida's life. Script is written to a mature and sophisticated audience, with no judgments on communist artists as Frida and Diego. Photography is plastic and rich in color and composition. Good team",Frida
205,darkettop3,"Hayek, that´s her name..",10,16 November 2002,"After almost a decade of struggle to produce and star this film, Salma Hayek, one of the best actress in Hollywood today, finally made it and the final product is just in one word: EXCELLENT!""Frida"" is a captivating experience for anyone who loves cinema, art and life. From the first sequence to the last ""touching"" scene, we get absorbed into the life of an unique woman: Frida Kahlo, that´s the only word I can use to describe her; an artist who transformed her pain into art and whose love for life is portrayed in a way no other actress but Hayek would have done...Director Julie Taymor puts all her ""Broadway touch"" in this picture, her personal style surrounds ""Frida"" using impressive visual effects that gives the film a sophisticated atmosphere.. Perhaps, that´s the background of ""Frida"", they are trying to introduce a new Mexico to the world, beyond pinatas and tequila (although the use of this one is seen frequently in the film).. The music and the wardrobe are also outstanding.The supporting cast ( including Ashley Judd, Antonio Banderas, Geoffrey Rush, Valeria Golino and Ed Norton) works efficiently but they are practically over-shadowed by Hayek and her co-star Alfred Molina (Diego Rivera). Their love story is so complicated that you really need to see it to believe it. Hayek and Molina embodies Frida and Diego so perfectly that from the first second both appear together on frame the chemistry between them fills the screen.Returning to Hayek, who is the key element of the film. She, as many might agree, is on her way to her first Oscar nomination, her work is just impressive, we see how she (Frida) evolves from a rebel teenager to a tormented woman, but don´t expect to see a tear-falling drama, at least not in a 100%, Salma as Frida wins the crowd with her charming, magnetic and deep portray of Kahlo; showing a ""collage"" of emotions that simply turns her irresistible..I won´t spoil the fun, but you´ll see a lot of humor, dance, sex and more sex in this beautiful film.Just prepare to be seduced by Salma Hayek and ""Frida""!",Frida
206,kanep11,Frida and Mexico Come to Life,10,24 October 2002,"What a fantastically realized film.  Frida comes to life.  From the consuming passion of Salma Hayek to the theatrical vision of Julie Taymor they bring a true love and knowledge of Frida's life and work to the screen. This is a movie of and for a Mexico most Americans are not familiar with. Anyone who has never been to a part of Mexico besides Cancun or Tijuana will realize what they have been missing out on when they see this movie. In an age where political freedoms are being taken away in our own country, Frida reminds us the value of allowing extreme political voices to coexist for we do not know from where the gifts of artistic beauty will emerge. This movie will awaken the creative spirit within anyone who sees it.  A beautiful reminder of the resonance and importance of art to society and how those ""extremists"" among us are the ones who truly shape the world.",Frida
207,matthelm22,The year's best movie (so far),8,13 November 2002,I absolutely adore both Salma Hayek and Frida.  This film is sure to get considerable Oscar consideration...maybe Best Picture and Best Actress. It would certainly have my vote.  This movie was a pleasure to watch! I cannot wait until it comes to DVD (hopefully with lots of extras to view.),Frida
208,sebastian-mieslinger-1,A Great Film,10,5 April 2003,"To my mind ""Frida"" is one of the great films you see only a few in a long time. The richness of the picture and the great emotional acting especially from Frida\ Salma Hayek makes this movie to a special experience. I´ll never forget it and of course also the motional story of Frida Carlo. But it is no easy film and therefore I understand not everybody can like it. Frida is a true film a powerful film which creates a wonderful mood. You have to like Frida if you allow yourself to watch it without prejudices and without childish thoughts. No film for kids!!in great admiration for Salma Hayek cu Sebastian",Frida
209,risa_jojo,My favorite movie,10,25 August 2003,"I just rented this two days ago on payperview. I am so in love. I am in love with Salma's performance and Alfred Molina's performance. The story was done unbelievably well. We were able to meet Frida in her paintings and out of them. We were really invited to see who Frida really was. They touched on the politics that Frida held dear. We were introduced to her ideas. I would have loved to see her in her wheelchair a week before she died with Diego behind her at a communist march but I guess we couldn't be given every part of her life in a couple hours. I think this was well made, the score and soundtrack was entrancing, the actors were well chosen and stunning and the set was magnificent. It is my new favorite movie. I could watch it every day.",Frida
210,Scully854,One of the most amazing movies I have seen!,10,16 March 2003,"I just saw Frida, the film based on famous Mexican artist Frida Kahlo...I highly recommend this movie.  It was amazing, they truly brought Frida alive again.  Salma Hayek really looks like Frida in the flick and the cinematography is stunning, the colors, the settings, and they do this amazing effect where the paintings seem to come to life.  The rest of the cast was amazing as well, especially the actor who plays her husband Diego. This film doesnt play like a dull A&E bio its a fasacinating life that comes alive on the screen.  Please, see it if you can.",Frida
211,janellefozz,Nothing short of amazing,9,29 September 2010,"Frida is a must see movie. Salma Hayek did an amazing job with this role. The tragedy, happiness, uniqueness, love, betrayal, and rich emotions reach out and touch you. This movie really showcases the art, and the animated scenes are nothing short of amazing.I have several favorite scenes: My favorite scene in the movie was the bar scene when Frida throws her drink in a man's face and starts a bar fight. Another favorite scene was the family portrait in which Frida chooses an outfit that is clearly inappropriate, which ties in later when she looks lovely, but traditional, in a wedding dress that she casts aside. Lastly, the drinking contest Frida wins to dance with the lovely woman, and the sensual scene that follows.I enjoy watching Frida and Diego together. I wish her father was in the movie more, because I enjoyed his character. I was disappointed in the scenes with Trotsky, for I think they could have spent more time developing his character. Lastly, they could have spent less time at the beginning of the movie developing her ""before the accident"" character, as she changes so little after the accident. The family photo scene, her spying on Diego, and her having a premarital sexual encounters would have sufficed.Overall, nothing short of amazing.",Frida
212,sunnysidebeach,A fine balance,9,22 October 2013,"I'm a ""Mexiphile"", enamoured of the country, its people, culture, history, and am overwhelmed by both Diego's and Frida's art. Salma's labour of love condensed two supersized lives into two hours which, by sheer necessity, had to paint their entwined lives as metaphorically. We just watched it again for the third time. I like it better every time. Probably a box office failure because it was too gringo for the Mexicans and too Mexican for the gringos, a fine balance which Julie Taymor finessed. I give high marks for the acting, the colours of Mexico, the music by Elliot Goldenthal which also captures the flavours of Mexico. The screen writing is terse, tight, humorous, and human. Learn something about Kahlo, Rivera, the muralist movement, Rivera's osmotic art education in Europe and his panoply of styles before he ""rediscovered"" Mexico...then watch Frida: a classic work of art.",Frida
213,ionm,Absolutely great!,10,25 October 2003,"""Frida was was an extraordinary film with a magnificent cast and especially Salma Hayek, who should have won the oscar for her performance in that movie more than Nicole Kidman who won for her medium performance in ""The Hours"". There is absolutely no doubt about that. And i am very surprised that ""Frida"" is not in the imdb top 250, when some movies should't be there. Like for example ""toy story 2""",Frida
214,ylangylang,beautiful surface but not enough depth,4,13 March 2004,"I was very disappointed with this film.  If it weren't for its exceptional music, costumes, and set design, it would seem just like another run-of-the-mill network TV movie.  It presents the major facets of Frida's life--the terrible accident, her great love for Rivera, lesbian dalliances, miscarriage, her art work, affair with Trotsky, etc.-- as if it were marking off a list.  There isn't enough grit, or something, in Hayek's protrayal of Frida.  Alfred Molina is good as Diego, but there is little chemistry between him and Hayek; their great love does not seem really palpable to me. To its credit, it does show many of her paintings, but it doesn't linger long enough on any one of them.  I would rather it linger on a few and have the story built around them.  There is a lack of cohesiveness in the story. It was a let-down to me.",Frida
215,greg-smith12,why no dvd in the uk?,9,8 January 2004,"well, i firstly have to ask why there is no dvd in the uk for this movie? i have been waiting for soooo long to get a copy and have raved about it to everyone and i cant buy it yet, it is very frustrating!  if anyone knows any plans for a launch date or why it hasnt been launched here yet i would be grateful to find out. so now, about the movie, well i loved it.  ive been a fan of frida's artwork for some years and this movie really for me brought another level to the life of frida.  i thought the vibrancy and the passion was so captivating and sublime.  it also helped to explain the meaning of frida's work and brought her life story to the full.  i think this is selma hayek's finest work in getting this project done, i commend her and say thank you for making this movie.  i cannot fault this film really, it brought light, laughter, passion, anguish, and life to a great artist and is a great testament to film history.",Frida
216,zeetakje,great movie,9,23 February 2004,"I think it is a great movie! When it started with all the blue walls, it was just like in the book. It is realistic and very moving.The nude scene didn't bother me at all.The music is also very good. I bought the cd right away.",Frida

218,alecoronan,Frida Forever!,10,5 December 2014,"In my point of view, no Mexican painter was like Frida Kahlo. Aside from being my idol, just her life inspired me in many ways. Both, everything she suffered, as the strength and courage that characterized her. In this film, the image and life of Frida is reflected well, in my opinion, perfectly fine. How she dresses, which was something that identified her, like her famous eyebrow and mustache, everything was perfect. In this film, directed by Julie Taymor, is completely different from what you might expect from a ""film / documentary"" of the life of an artist such as Frida. By implementing the drawings of animated skeletons when she comes out of a coma, or when she imagines Diego as King Kong, among others, make even more original film. As I said, in my personal view this movie I qualify as excellent.",Frida
219,etiennemarais,Attempted biopic about the life of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo,6,13 January 2006,"Was it not for the multiple-personality disorder that this flick suffers from, it could have been a reasonable one...well, only if it could also lose Ms Hayek in all her different capacities.It is simply attempting to be too many things all at once; from arty movie to movie about art history to biopic, but unfortunately it only barely becomes a movie masquerading as art. Its obsession with the Hayek figure (fresh out of gym and painted in the softest, sweatiest light) destroys so much of the premise; for xxx'x sakes Ms Taymor, Frida had a broken body...and oh yes, Virgin Active did not exist in the 1930's - really, look it up ! Bordering on criminality, the amazingly mundane character development has the two leads portraying, shallow, unintelligent, decadent one-liner-blurbing versions of their subject matter roles. It is difficult to decide which entity is more to blame for this: scripting, direction, casting or the players themselves; but whatever the culpable combination is, it simply serves to underline on how many levels this film fails. Unless of course, this is really a flick about Ms Hayek's flashy (read trashy) looks and impeccable (read beach-bimbo) physique, in which case about four minutes of it succeeds.The arty crafts are over-done and over-saturated, although it includes some seriously good eye-candy; personal favourites were the magicorealist blue bird escaping (well designed metaphor) and the pulp fiction strip in the hospital. Some other multimedia collages also worked extremely well, especially the ones depicting Frida's work ""in motion"", thereby creating at least SOME title role exploration - a quality severely lacking elsewhere.",Frida
220,maihiggs,A piece of art,9,25 August 2018,"Art cannot reflect the entire truth of reality. Much like this definition of art, Frida is a reflection of the renound mexican artists life with beauty and finesse. Although some elements of the reality of Frida's life are less developed, such as the constant suffering which is referred to at random moments in the film, this biographical portrait of Khalo is accurate enough. 
I found the tempest of desire and passion between Frida and Diego (and their many lovers) a gripping story. Furthermore the cinematography is exquisite, carefully integrating the artist's work whilst being subtle enough to maintain an excellent narrative. The main characters are well developed and one cannot help but feel their suffering as they work through the difficulties of life and love.",Frida
