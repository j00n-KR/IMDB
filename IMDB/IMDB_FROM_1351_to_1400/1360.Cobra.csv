0,bkoganbing,Razzie History,2,19 October 2009,"With Cobra I think Sylvester Stallone went over the top with his tough screen persona. There is a limit as to how much the movie-going public will swallow. Note that he hasn't done a Cobra II in his career, dare I say no one's approached him with the project.Stallone is Lieutenant Mario Cabretti and he functions as a kind of one man SWAT team for the LAPD. When we first meet him, he's been sent for to dispatch a particularly loathsome cretin who's shooting up a supermarket. Dirty Harry couldn't have done a better job.However Stallone thinks this guy and his psychotic crime might be connected to a series of brutal knifings that have taken place throughout the city recently. Of course he can't get anyone to believe him, still he gets on the task force about those killings.And he draws another assignment, protect the only person to survive an attack, model Birgitte Nielsen. But he's frustrated at every turn as this gang of bikers seem always to be a step ahead of them. Not that this urban version of Rambo isn't up to what they can dish out.Cobra was a film created for Stallone and Nielsen whom he was involved with at the time. Nielsen is a beautiful statuesque model who acts on the level of a high school production. Did you ever think Sly Stallone would outact anyone in any film? The film is a ripoff of Dirty Harry, but Clint Eastwood never insulted the audience's intelligence the way this film does. However it did have both Reni Santoni and Andy Robinson in the cast who were also in Dirty Harry. Robinson who was the psychotic Scorpio in Dirty Harry is Stallone's supervisor in Cobra. But poor Santoni who was the first partner Dirty Harry left behind was also injured aiding Stallone in that final shootout with the biker gang.I believe the Tom Hanks-Dan Ackroyd film satiric version of Dragnet used the biker gang in Cobra as part of the satire. Cobra also made a sweep of the Razzie Awards winning Worst Picture, Worst Actor for Stallone, Worst Actress for Birgitte Nielsen and three others.At night you could hear the plaintive cry of Sylvester Stallone singing to Birgitte Nielsen, ""yo, what I did for love.""",Cobra
1,Leofwine_draca,Mindless '80s mayhem - I love it!,9,10 April 2016,"Typical action-packed mid '80s fare, along the lines of RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD PART II or COMMANDO in that it depicts a whole army of bad guys getting stylishly wiped out in various ways. This short, sharp movie is classic cheese action entertainment with little plot and lots of stuntmen. Sylvester Stallone is in his element as the charismatic loner, a clichéd maverick cop whose hard-as-nails wisecracks are actually funny for a change. Whether he's wasting a supermarket-siege psycho in the opening moments or machine-gunning an army of motorbike-riding weirdos in the film's eye-popping finale, Stallone is in his prime here although ironically the film bombed at the box office (which explains the lack of sequels). Those super-cool '80s-style sunglasses help too.The plot rather successfully tries to emulate a slasher movie as it opens with repeated scenes of a psychopathic killer murdering innocent female victims with a rather nasty-looking shiny knife. Despite being gore-free the murders are rather sleazy, employing some fine mad acting from veteran hardman villain Brian Thompson and some icky sound effects to make up for the lack of claret on view. After a tense and surprisingly effective hospital stalk-and-slash sequence the film drops this mock-horror angle, instead moving into comic-book all-out action stuff as Stallone engages in a crowd-pleasing car chase, full of vehicles jumping over hills (like in every other '80s cop film), mindless destruction and a few cool stunts like the boat crash and the car-park jump. Then there's the acclaimed (in the realms of cheesy action fans, that is) finale, in which Stallone and his crew retreat to a countryside motel as a hideout and are attacked by an entire army of psychopaths who are mown down by Stallone's machine gun.The climax takes place in one of those clichéd factory locations which gives Stallone further chance to burn, break and butcher the opposition, rarely breaking a sweat and tossing off more wisecracks at every opportunity (one quip - ""You have the right to remain silent - forever"" to a burning victim - was needlessly cut from the film by British censors for being too sadistic). Finally it's the one on one fight with the 'Night Slasher' (cool name), the head honcho who ends up being impaled on a hook and fried in a kiln. What more could one ask for? Well, a real story perhaps, a realistic script and good acting. They don't come close to any of those three in this film yet it remains a largely entertaining enterprise due to the fast-pacing and endless action, plus comic relief that works. It's funny because it's so clichéd and enjoyably brainless fun.Stallone is supported by Brigitte Nielsen (RED SONJA), who doesn't really get to be anything else other than a damsel-in-distress as the witness who becomes a stalked victim, and veteran Andrew Robinson (HELLRAISER) as the antagonistic superior. Reni Santoni is effective as a likable sidekick whilst Brian Thompson excels in what is one of his scariest (in both physical appearance and hefty bulk) performances to date. Aside from this, there's not much to say. Endless explosions, destruction, people being shot repeatedly and more stuntmen than you can shake a stick at - if that sounds like your idea of fun then by all means give this mindless slice of '80s cheesiness a try.",Cobra
2,SnoopyStyle,some cheesy fun,3,15 April 2016,"Lieutenant Marion 'Cobra' Cobretti (Sylvester Stallone) is a volatile violent LAPD detective. His partner is Sergeant Gonzales. If there are rules, Cobra is sure to break them. The city is terrorized by Night Slasher who attacks random targets. He is actually the leader of a mysterious underground group with an unknown goal. Ingrid (Brigitte Nielsen) is a model driving late at night. Unbeknownst to her, she sees the Night Slasher's face. With help inside the LAPD, the group tracks her down but she escapes.This is full-on cheesy. This is basically a violent comic book movie without the realism. These villains love their hammers. It is ridiculous. Sly's acting is not good enough even for a Rambo movie. The story is nothing. There are some action. The explosions almost make this fun.",Cobra
3,Prismark10,Cobra,3,6 July 2020,"Smarting over the success of Beverly Hills Cop that Stallone passed on.Sylvester Stallone reworks elements of Beverly Hills Cop which ends up an an updated glossy Dirty Harry remake courtesy of the Golan-Globus Cannon boys.This is loud, noisy, stupid and pumped with radio friendly 1980s soft rock.The opening scene has a psycho shooting everyone in a supermarket. You know he is a rotter because he parks in a disabled spot. Only Lieutenant 'Cobra' Cobretti (Sylvester Stallone) from the Zombie Squad can stop him. He takes out all the worse scums, just like Dirty Harry who always gets the effluent end of the stick.Cobra has to protect model Ingrid (Brigitte Nielsen) who has seen the Night Slasher. A leader of an underground supremacist group who attack random targets. They have an insider in the police department the Night Slasher and his gang are out to kill Ingrid.The film recycles themes and lines from other Cannon films such as Death Wish and especially 10 to Midnight. You would think that if Stallone had pulled out of this movie, Charles Bronson was on standby.Stallone does not have lot to do. Just look pretty with his shades on, handle a lot of firearms and mumble a few lines. The romantic scenes with his then wife Nielsen are laughable. The actions scenes are uninspired and cheesy.It lacks any insights about organisations and the justice system that the movie Dirty Harry made. Just to highlight the connections with that movie. Andrew Robinson and Reni Santori who appear in Cobra also featured in Dirty Harry.",Cobra
4,gavin6942,Stallone As Stallone Lovers Love Stallone,5,29 September 2007,"When the police need the dirty work done, they call in Cobra. He gets in there, makes a mess, leaves the bodies in piles and then gets back out. And boy is he in for a treat -- a secret society (that likes clanging axes together underground) is in town, trying to start a new world order. Can Cobra defeat an entire society and their henchman, the Night Slasher? If you like Stallone, this is your film. We have Stallone playing Lieutenant Marion 'Cobra' Cobretti, the renegade cop. We have his wife Brigitte Nielsen playing the model Ingrid, who also acts as Stallone's love interest and target of the enemy. Oh, and Stallone wrote this script, too (allegedly basing it off of his rejected script for ""Beverly Hills Cop""). So, this has Stallone all over it -- like a towel at a party at Kitty and Stud's. Just no Frank Stallone.This film is pretty short and in your face. Before you know it, the film is over. If a director's cut exists (such as the one for ""Commando""), I strongly suggest they release it. This film could use more plot. I mean, it doesn't need the plot -- this is action -- but you almost wonder at times. The society is not explained very well, and I would like to know more about where they came from, what their goals are and who their leader is.But yeah, we have gun fights, car chases, motorcycle chases, guns in the back of cars, guys getting thrown off the room, people with knives in the hospital, a van that likes to run people down... pretty much unless you're comatose or on Valium you're not going to be able to rest your eyes while this film takes you to adrenaline heaven.If you like other Stallone films like ""Cop Land"" and ""Demolition Man"", this is one to see. Or ""Commando"" (which is a better movie, but they're in the same league and vein). I've seen this film twice now, and I have a suspicion I'll be seeing it again before long. Keep your eyes peeled for this one at your local video store.",Cobra
5,jboothmillard,Cobra,4,21 August 2010,"From director George P. Cosmatos (Escape to Athena, Rambo: First Blood Part II, Tombstone), I saw special features of Beverly Hills Cop and Sylvester Stallone was originally chosen for the part of Axel Foley. He tried to get his own way with the scripting, but he decided to leave with Eddie Murphy making the film a commercial success, but he didn't leave without taking his scripting ideas to make this film two years. Anyway, basically Lieutenant Marion 'Cobra' Cobretti (Razzie nominated Sylvester Stallone) is the intense, no-nonsense and take-no-prisoners cop who helps to bring down those extremist thugs. He is given his toughest challenge to catch the ""Night Slasher"", a ruthless killer who has already taken nineteen lives, all seemingly without reason and at random. The police has something that may help to finally catch this psycho, witness Ingrid Knudson (Celebrity Big Brother's Razzie nominated Brigitte Nielsen, Stallone's wife at the time) who saw one of his killings and the guilty man's face. Cobra and associate Sergeant Gonzales (Reni Santoni) agree that Ingrid should move upstate to get away from the violence, but inside information gets around and the bad guys follow them all the way. After many chases and explosions, the Night Slasher (twice Razzie nominated Brian Thompson) and his gang finally gang Ingrid and Cobra in a big power plant style warehouse, but don't worry, the bad guys get what they deserve. Also starring Candyman's Andrew Robinson as Detective Monte, Lee Garlington as Nancy Stalk, John Herzfeld as Cho and Art LaFleur as Captain Sears. The mirrored glasses and chewing matches look does well in the opening, but it fades into a pretty predictable story, even with a not bad car chase sequence, this detective action thriller could have been better. It was nominated the Razzies for Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay. Adequate!",Cobra
6,Woodyanders,"A truly beautiful, touching and thoughtful piece of sophisticated cinematic art from the glorious 80's",10,19 January 2007,"This gloriously ghastly celluloid abomination is downright jaw-dropping in its flagrant absurdity and stupidity. For starters, Sylvestor Stallone as Lt. Marion ""Cobra"" Cobretti has to be one of the single most slimy and hateful would-be ""heroes"" to ever ooze his scummy way across the screen: With his three day stubble, tight jeans, long black overcoat, mirror shades, leather gloves and penchant for chewing on unlit matchsticks, Cobra exudes all the appeal and charisma of a damp sewer rat. He's also crass, vicious and morally reprehensible, the kind of vile he-man who strictly adheres to a crude ""might makes right"" mentality and uses excessive brute force as often as possible. Reni Santoni grumbles and mumbles his way into our hearts as Cobra's endearingly grubby junk food junkie partner Gonzales. Brian Thompson snarls, sneers and spits for all it's worth as the deranged head villain (Thompson's delirious climactic speech towards the end is uproarious; he keeps using the word ""pig"" until it becomes some sort of maniacal mantra). The cult of crazed lunatics terrorizing the city are a total campy hoot: For some inexplicable reason they engage in this bizarre ritual in which they clink axes over their heads. Some of them wear filthy t-shirts and dirty jeans; others are dressed in suits. The cult appears to be made up of a diverse cross section of insane folks who are brought together by their mutual love for unhinged psychotic violence. In addition, they want to blithely butcher all us nice law-abiding average weaklings in order to make way for some new world order of gleefully nihilistic murderous barbarians. Ahh, ain't that sweet?The gorgeously statuesque Brigitte Nielson at least looks properly stunning as a lovely aspiring model the wackos target for annihilation. Considering that Brigitte is six feet tall and built like a Buick, the scenes of her running away in stark fear from the nuts are absolutely gut-busting. She could have easily taken out at least a dozen of these freaks by delivering roundhouse kicks to their groins with her incredibly long legs, but I guess I'm digressing here. Val Avery as a huffy police chief, Art La Fleur as an irate captain, and especially Andrew Robinson as a sniveling by-the-book geeky wimp mostly just stand around and voice their disapproval of Cobra's wildly unorthodox methods. Director George P. Cosmatos tackles the ridiculous premise with a slick punchy'n'polished hopped-up style as if he was making high art; there's a few alarmingly atrocious music montage sequences set to horrible head-banging hair band rock songs. Plus there's a shockingly abundant plethora of blatant product placements featured throughout. The amazing opening grocery store massacre set piece proudly has product placements for such items as Pepsi and Coors beer. The dialogue in this set piece is priceless: When a ranting fruitcake threatens to waste a few innocent people, Cobra flatly replies: ""Go ahead, I don't shop here."" ""Motel Hell"" 's Nina Axelrod briefly pops up as an ill-fated diner waitress and ""Sledge Hammer"" 's David Rasche does a similarly fleeting turn as an equally doomed sleazeball photographer. Moreover, there's a raw, gritty, seedy edge to the scuzzy proceedings which really makes this movie that much more gross and disgusting. A terrifically tacky'n'trashy kitsch riot.",Cobra
7,ma-cortes,Stallone vehicle in which Cobra decides to deal out justice in his own hands against maniacal killers,5,24 December 2009,"This entry in ¨Vigilante genre¨ contains amount of action and excessive violence. It concerns about Cobra(Silvester Stallone) a Rambo-alike , a rebel and violent cop. Various people are killed by furious band led by a punk (Brian Thomson). Furthermore, a beautiful cover-up(Brigitte Nielsen) is witness a mugging by the heinous criminals. The nasties stalk the gorgeous youngster who is submitted to a brutal hot pursuit and the cop protects her . Then Cobra with sun-glasses and his classic car takes the law into his own hands, searching vengeance on crooks, hoodlums, muggers, making the neighborhood safer. Cobra is determined to bring in psychotic serial killer , even if he has to break some rules. Finally, happens an exciting, edge-of-your-seat climax .This new outing in this thrilling genre contains suspense, thrills,chills, noisy action-packed, gun-play and lots of violence. Stallone with his usual stoic acting displays amount of weapons arsenal killing nasties. Appears as secondary casting, Brian Thomson as a heinous murderous and Andy Robinson and Art Le Fleur as superior officers who are constantly arguing with Cobra . Furthermore secondaries as Val Avery,Nina Axelrod, David Rasche and the director John Herzfeld, among others. Colorful and atmospheric cinematography by Ric Waite. Outdated musical score is composed by means of synthesizer and full of songs of the 80s. The motion picture is middling directed by George Pan Cosmatos. He's a mediocre director who got a great success with ¨Tombstone¨and ¨Cassandra crossing¨ and flops as ¨Shadow conspiracy¨, ¨Leviatahan¨, ¨Escape to Athena¨ and ¨Massacre in Rome¨. This typical low grade story will appeal to Silvester Stallone fans.",Cobra
8,BA_Harrison,Big car. Big gun. Big body count.,6,13 September 2016,"1986: the battle for '80s action hero supremacy rages on, Sylvester Stallone countering Arnold Schwarzenegger's Commando (1985) with Cobra, a violent, ego-stroking exercise in machismo in which the Italian Stallion stars as hard-boiled, no-nonsense cop Marion Cobretti, whose policing methods make Dirty Harry look like a liberal by comparison.Clad in trench-coat and bun-hugging jeans, and wearing aviator shades while chewing a matchstick, cool-as-a-cucumber Cobretti is called in to do the jobs considered too dangerous for the other cops, which usually means gunning down armed psychos. This makes him the perfect man to protect fashion model Ingrid Knudsen (Brigitte Nielsen), who is the only person who can identify the leader of a gang of crazed killers that have been terrorising Los Angeles.Just about as '80s as an action flick can get, this film is full of embarrassing macho posturing from its star, and lots of expensive set-pieces in which cars get trashed, stuff blows up, and people are riddled with bullets, all accompanied by a nasty soundtrack of forgettable pop/rock songs. Cobretti saunters through the death and destruction suffering nary a scratch while offing countless bad guys with ease, pausing occasionally to mumble the obligatory witty one-liners (although none of them are very memorable on this occasion).Giving able support are Andrew Robinson as Cobretti's asshole colleague Detective Monte and Reni Santoni as gruff police boss Sergeant Tony Gonzales (both of whom were in Dirty Harry—coincidence? I think not). At the other end of the acting scale we have Brian Thompson as Night Slasher, who is truly awful, and Nielsen, who is as wooden as always, but who was cast for her looks and her willingness to sleep with the star (unsurprisingly, her mid-'80s career boost was as short-lived as her relationship with Sly).",Cobra
9,moonspinner55,"His actual name is Marion, but he chews on matches so you know he's tough...",3,3 December 2006,"Cheesy, grindhouse exploitation action flick has city cop Sylvester Stallone tracking down a band of killers who belong to a devil cult. Brigitte Nielsen (at the time, Mrs. Stallone) is very appealing as a model/eyewitness whom the killers have targeted next; her rapport with Stallone is actually quite convincing and warm, but this tentative relationship belongs in a different movie altogether. Veteran director George P. Cosmatos throws in lots of action sequences and violent mayhem, but he's working from a bare-bones script (by Stallone, via the book by Paula Gosling) and can't escape the clichés, some of which are shameless. *1/2 from ****",Cobra
10,paul_haakonsen,"Sunglasses, leather gloves and a toothpick...",6,9 June 2018,"While ""Cobra"" is not one of Sylvester Stallone's best movies, it is still an enjoyable action movie. and definitely one of the movies that helped establish him further in the action genre.The story in ""Cobra"" is very 1980s, in the sense that it is a single super cop that takes on a whole gang and emerges victorious. So it follows that generic action movie prototype that flourished in the 1980s.Sure, you will not be intellectually be challenged by ""Cobra"", but then again, were you ever by any of Stallone's movies? Nah, this is action as it is intended to be. So just lean back and enjoy the ride.Sylvester Stallone actually does a great job in the role of Cobra and carries the movie quite nicely. While the main villain, played by Brian Thompson, was a bit too generic and laughable.""Cobra"" is good enough for a nostalgic flashback to the pinnacle of Stallone's action career.",Cobra
11,Quinoa1984,"""No... you're history""",5,20 April 2009,"Looking at Cobra is like peeking in to a time capsule dug underground and unearthed for all to look at in awe. Not because it's a particular 'good' movie, but because of its time and place and its level of completely tasteless action and ""plot"". Cobra stars Stallone as Cabretti aka ""Cobra"", a killer robot masquerading as an Italian-stallion detective who wears his sunglasses like they come as part of the GI Joe action set. He's after a killer, or *killers* as he has to continually point out to his pathetically clichéd higher-ups, and has to protect a woman, model Ingrid (Brigitte Nielson as decent eye-candy and less than so-so actress) from being targeted by the killer squad.The tag-line seems to suggest that Cobra might be wiping out criminal elements as they appear *in reality* in 1986-era L.A. The crime wave was something fierce at the time, going as far as to influence comic books like Watchmen and The Dark Knight Returns. But Cobra functions so much as a comic book it would keep Frank Miller gasping for the oxygen tank: Cobra is after a ridiculously armed and well-stocked group of assassins who we see stand in formation in dungeons or basements or whatever clanging their axes like they're trying to emulate the army art from Pink Floyd's the Wall. You would wonder why something sensible would happen against a band of crazy killers who seem to kill at random until they focus on this ONE WOMAN, like say if the FBI would get involved... but no, it's only Cobra, he's the cure, they're disease, yada-yada.So much of this is so implausible it counter-acts what could be some good ol' mindless dumb action fun. It's TOO mindless, and at times too boring (those 80s montages are so wretched as to edit on the beats of the forgettable 80s synth-pop) to even really care. If it isn't dull then it's just so... huh? There is a car chase, for example, where one sees Cobra chasing after (or being chased by) the killer squad, and seeing his car once or twice do one of those jumps and crashes that would normally kill any car is one thing - but when it reaches the eighth or ninth time it's just too much. Add to that Stallone's non-acting, his incredulous one-liners, and you got yourself some dated stuff.And yet, it isn't exactly a failure or a totally bad movie. The opening sequence at the supermarket is exciting and violent in that degree that keeps tension building for at least a little while. And the director- hack George P. Cosmatos- does direct some of the absurd violence in the climax at the factory with some panache and thrills. But it's hard to stack up against what doesn't work in the film. Cobra is what other cop movies- not least of which Stallone's own co-vehicle Tango & Cash and Demolition Man- parodided, and it shows.",Cobra
12,Coventry,"Eat this, Dirty Harry!",5,13 March 2010,"After literally struggling my way through the terrible Italian rip-off ""Black Cobra"" (starring a nearly sleeping Fred Williamson), I figured it was about time to give Stallone's pretentious and ego-boosting 80's action vehicle another re-watch. I have fond memories of ""Cobra"". I was still very young when it first aired on TV, and the broadcast came with the announcement that the film was strictly prohibited for younger viewers because of the extreme violence, but I watched it anyway and it became an instant favorite. Surely this is a very dim-witted and politically incorrect popcorn action flick, but it's an undemanding thrill-riot and pretty much Sylvester Stallone's (who also wrote the script) shameless gift to himself in order to boost up his own ego even more! After the ""Rocky"" films in the 70's and the ""Rambo"" flicks in the 80's, Stallone was a huge star and this movie is seemingly just written to confirm that he is the ultimate definition of cool. ""Cobra"" found most of its inspiration in the Clint Eastwood classic ""Dirty Harry"", but Stallone does everything to make Marion Cobretti come across as even more indifferent, rebellious and tough. He chews matches, barely ever takes off his over-sized sunglasses, drives an odious 50's car and talks like he's digesting a load of sulfur. The Cobra works for the LAPD ""zombie squad"", which is aptly described as the bottom line department. They only deal with scum, you see. The city of Los Angeles is being terrorized by a sick serial killer known as the Night Slasher, who already massacred 16 people in less than a month's time. Cobra suggests there might be more than one killer, but his superiors don't listen to him. He's right, of course. There are at least twenty crazed killers, repeatedly clobbering two axes together as some sort of ritual, and during the outrageous climax their number even increases to about fifty. Brigitte Nielsen, whose character is the ultimately dumb and docile female stereotype, witnessed one of the murders and had a good look at the lead psycho's frightful face. This makes her the next target for murder, but she needn't worry too much as the Cobra will take her under his protection. You can easily debate endlessly over the silliness and incoherence of the script, as well as on the giant amount of plot holes and fascist undertones, but isn't it much easier to leave your brain capacities at the door and simply enjoy a tremendously fun and typically 80's bad movie? There's plenty to laugh at, like four cheesy and completely redundant musical interludes, crazy bad guys driveling about ""The New World"", an extended and indescribably spectacular car chase sequence (including the coolest 180° handbrake skid to stop and shoot at the pursuers!), horrendous one-liners like ""You're a disease I'm the cure"" and a body count that pretty much surpasses every other action blockbuster ever made! Could you possibly be looking for more in an 80's action flick?",Cobra
13,sunwarrior13,Crime Is The Disease And Cobra Is The Cure,6,28 October 2011,"Crime is the disease and Sylvester Stallone is the cure in movie,Cobra.It stars Stallone together with his ex-wife,Brigitte Nielsen,Reni Santoni, and Andrew Robinson.It was an action film directed by George P. Cosmatos. In the movie,Stallone plays Marion Cobretti,a cop called in when regular police methods have failed.Also known as Cobra,he is sent to get a cult of Charles Manson-like serial killers and to protect Ingrid,portrayed by Nielsen - who happens to be a beautiful and a statuesque witness who is set to testify against them. He deposits Ingrid in an out-of-the-way town for safe-keeping, but a mole in the police department tips off the killers. The gang comes racing into town to get Ingrid, but Cobra is there waiting for them, ready to spring into action. In the end,Cobretti's department arrives and begins clean-up of the town and credits roll as Cobretti and Ingrid climb onto one of the motorcycles and ride away.The story capitalizes manly on the action scenes and Stallone's popularity as an action star.It promises to deliver a Rambo-type movie only this time,he is a police man that tries to captures the criminals.The movie was nominated for six Razzie Awards including Worst Picture, Worst Actor for Sylvester Stallone,Worst Actress for non- actress Brigitte Nielsen, Worst Supporting Actor and Worst New Star both for Brian Thompson,who also is a non-actor and Worst Screenplay for the story was non-engaging and uninteresting from beginning to end.The only thing it gives the viewer is pure entertainment especially from those who loves action films and nothing more.That is why it became a box office hit during the time of its release.",Cobra

15,hitchcockthelegend,"This is where the law stops and I start, sucker!",7,10 July 2020,"Cobra is directed by George P. Cosmatos and written by Paula Gosling (novel Fair game) and Sylvester Stallone. It stars Stallone, Brigitte Nielsen, Brian Thompson, Reni Santoni, Andrew Robinson, John Herzfeld and Lee Garlington. Music is by Sylvester Levay and cinematography by Ric Waite.A tough-on-crime street cop must protect the only surviving witness to a strange murderous cult with far-reaching plans.Cobra is a tantalising peek as to just what Stallone's ""Beverley Hills Cop"" would have looked like. He had turned in a gritty and ballsy action screenplay but the studio balked at the cost and thus went with the comedic Eddie Murphy route (which worked great as it happens).This truncated 1hour and 20 minute Cobra just hints at what a dark edgy action film we should have had before the scissor suits at the studio got panicky and cut out a third of the pic.What we have left though is still good fun, Stallone is on cocky and cool bad dude mode, the villain is OTT (Brian Thompson actually looks like Arnie in some facial shots), Nielsen is in her natural bodily state... while the action we do get is high octane. It's hardly a stinker, if a little frustrating with a ""what might have been hanging"" over it, and of course the editing is shoddy. 6.5/10",Cobra
16,Theo Robertson,Dirty Marion,4,9 February 2013,"This came out just after FIRST BLOOD PART 2 when Sylvester Stallone was the biggest movie star in the world . It's certainly a star vehicle for Stallone and it received a lot of marketing on its release , which was only due to Stallone playing the anti-hero . On its own merits it's a confused , nasty violent mean thriller owing a lot to the DIRTY HARRY franchise . Interesting that Reni Santoni and Andrew Robinson appear in supporting roles and the title sequence features a voice over featuring crime figures . Whilst Clint Eastwood carries a modicum of decency and empathy in his roles making him likable the same can not be said about Stallone The film starts with a freakoid going in to a supermarket shooting up a display of fruit and trolleys before holding customers hostage and murdering one . The cops understandably think the gunman means business so call on their one man army - CobraCobra goes in to the supermarket , grabs the public announcement and declares to the gunman that : "" You're a lousy shot and I don't like lousy shots ""Right so someone is a murderer and is holding a group of terrified customers hostage in a supermarket and the main reason to hate this guy is that he's a lousy shot ? To be fair the film does try to make the audience take to Stallone's character down to the fact he drives an old car and has a female name . No seriously this tough , macho , butch cop is called Marion . I guess that's why he's so tough because he had to stick up for himself at an early age due to his name Having a mucho macho protagonist called Marion is the nearest the film has to comic relief . The rest of the movie is so cruel and mean spirited you'll feel like taking a shower after watching it . It also has a contradictory moral stance since Marion Cobra is so fascist and violent you'd almost expect him to be joining the quasi cult of the New Order bad guys . When a film contradicts its own morality it's never a good sign and COBRA is not a good film",Cobra
17,Scarecrow-88,This is where the law stops..and I start,7,14 February 2007,"Marion Cobretti(Sly Stallone playing the hero with a raspy, low-toned voice making him evoke quiet anger)is an officer of the elite Zombie squad(although, we never see an official group of members who also participate on this squad)..those who handle the cases no one else wants to touch. He's called to protect a model named Ingrid(Brigitte Nielsen)from violent sicko thugs whose ideal is a perfect world without the weak..weak being mostly women. Their symbol is a skull with axes over head. The gang like to hang out in some sort of darkened factory banging their axes together in adulation of their group's belief in killing who they deem the inferior. The members of this violent cult are merely in the film to service the plot with remorseless, mindless monsters for Cobra to destroy. Lots of dying in this one with many men getting shot. It's all inspired by the Dirty Harry formula where the justice system is failing, letting monsters re-enter society causing a risk to the innocents. Cobra is the representative against letting those vermin get away with their dastardly crime. When a dangerous situation spirals out of control, just call Cobra..he will save the day. Andrew Robinson has the role of Detective Monte..we are supposed to look at him as the bad guy because he wishes to give those who commit crime a fair shake even if they just murdered five women in cold blood. Andy must endure this role because he looks like a clown for wanting to follow the rules. Cobra is Stallone's invention that can not miss his target while a massive group of bad guys fire endlessly not even coming close to hitting him. Sure, his partner Gonzales(Reni Santoni)gets shot at the end..but not Cobra.I won't lie the film is pure macho nihilism..it's ugly and cruel. It's not politically correct, not very bright, and, at times, is unrealistic and ridiculous. And, you know what..it's perfect 80's action junk that wets the appetite of those who crave the hamburger instead of the salad. COBRA is not good for you and it has one very corny rock soundtrack to match it's grade-A quality cheese. If you want to sit back and waste 90 minutes on lots of people getting bullets in their bodies as they fly off their motorcycles..this is the finest example. Stallone wrote it and makes himself a bad ass with his shades, short hair cut, match-stick from his lip, and the cool car with nitro that makes it go 120 miles-per-hour. Brian Thompson does a lot of spitting and grimacing as the slasher of innocent women(his face reminds me of a shark about to strike those who swim just a bit too far).",Cobra
18,Hey_Sweden,"""This is where the law stops...and I start...sucker.""",8,14 March 2012,"Long live the 1980s, a decade that delighted in delivering to us this kind of corpse littered escapism. ""Cobra"" is one of the most amusing and bad ass of the bunch, finding star Sylvester Stallone in fine form as Marion ""Cobra"" Cobretti, a cop whose job it is to take out society's garbage. He faces a big challenge when trying to protect Ingrid Knudson (Brigitte Nielsen), a model who can identify one of the goons among a death dealing cult bent on slashing their way to a new world order. Of course, they never reckoned on the Cobra factor, as our hero continuously defies death while taking down bad guy after bad guy.Now, how CAN one hate such a definitive '80s action flick, one with a sunglasses wearing good guy who cuts his pizza with scissors, puts his newspaper on the barbecue, keeps a matchstick jutting out of his mouth, and has a witticism for most every occasion? The answer is you can't! The action is fast and furious, when it comes, and the pacing is great, and Cobra is set up extremely well in our endlessly entertaining opening sequence, wherein he must deal with a psycho in a supermarket. When the creep threatens destruction, Cobra quips, ""Go ahead - I don't shop here."" He also makes it clear that when one person wastes another, for nothing, they must expect to be wasted.The soundtrack features a number of catchy tunes, among them ""Angel of the City"", ""Feel the Heat"", and ""Voice of America's Sons"". There's a cheesy, hilarious montage cross cutting between the actions of Cobra and partner / junk food addict Tony Gonzales (Reni Santoni) as they pursue leads and a photo shoot where Ingrid is posing among some silly looking robots!Cobra butts heads with stubborn superiors, including Art La Fleur and Val Avery, and fellow detective Monte (Andrew Robinson), explains away his attitude problem, bemoans the sight of french fries drowned in ketchup, and mocks the knick knacks at a roadside stand. The acting, from everyone involved, gets the job done; Nielsen actually isn't bad at all, Brian Thompson is a riot as a nutty goon who can spit out the word ""pig"" like nobody's business, David Rasche pops up briefly as a horny, ill-fated photographer, and Lee Garlington is an unsmiling cop.It's been theorized, reasonably enough, that ""Cobra"" is Stallones' tribute to the quintessential maverick detective thriller ""Dirty Harry"", right down to the casting of Santoni and Robinson who were both also in that film. The climactic action in the foundry is some seriously great stuff, and features some impressive fire gags.When the action fan is through with ""Cobra"", they'll be left with a big, goofy smile on their faces; this movie is just that much fun. It's based on the novel ""Fair Game"" by Paula Gosling (which would be filmed again under that title almost a decade later), with Sly himself getting the screenplay credit. He's reunited with ""Rambo: First Blood Part II"" director George P. Cosmatos, and ensures that we all have a good time, right from start to finish, as he provides the cure for the disease that is crime.Eight out of 10.",Cobra

20,poolandrews,"""Call the Cobra."" Top quality 80's action fest, one of the very best.",8,20 November 2007,"Cobra is set in Los Angeles where 16 murdered people have been attributed to 'the Night Slasher', a media name for a sadistic random killer stalking the LA streets. The LAPD are clueless & Captain Sears (Art LaFleur) has only one option left open to him, to call in the tough & uncompromising Marion Cobretti AKA 'Cobra' (writer Sylvester Stallone) from the zombie squad to uses his unique yet effective methods to find the killer. Meanwhile a model named Ingrid (Brigitte Nielsen) sees the Night Stalker (Brian Thompson) & his accomplices at a murder scene & instantly becomes the only witness who can identify him, after an attempt is made on her life Cobra sees to it personally to protect her & take the Night Stalker along with his followers down...Directed by the late George P. Cosmatos this was the best film he ever made & is an absolute blast if your a fan of 80's testosterone filled action flicks. Teaming up with star Sylvester Stallone once again after Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985) from the year before Cosmatos turns in a highly enjoyable cheese fest, it's just so entertaining from start to finish I find it incredible someone could not like this film. The script was surprisingly penned by Stallone himself (apparently he used a lot of ideas in Cobra he developed for Beverly Hills Cop (1984) which he had been signed up to star in) & is an action packed, ultra violent thriller which moves along like a rocket & is just so much fun to sit down & watch. From the moment the clueless cop outside the supermarket at the start said 'call the Cobra' (not just 'call Cobra' but 'call THE Cobra'!) & seconds later Stallone arrived in his car screeching to a halt, him getting out with long overcoat, mirrored shades, chewing on a match-stick with a Cobra embossed handgun down the front of his jeans I knew, I just knew this was going to be something special! Then once Cobra breaks every rule in the book by entering the supermarket, shooting at the terrorist, stopping off to drink some beer from a stand & after the terrorist threatens to blow the hostages & supermarket up Cobra replies 'go ahead, I don't shop here' it was confirmed that Cobra would be a classic! At one point the Night Stalker shouts 'we are the future' to which Stallone replies 'no your not, your history!', I'm not being funny here but quality dialogue like that doesn't just write itself you know & it just doesn't happen by accident either. No, it takes a real genius, ladies & gentlemen Sylvester Stallone is that genius. Cobra, wow what a film. Cobra, wow what a bloke. It's all here, 80's action junkies will love one & if you don't then you aren't a true fan of the genre!Director Cosmatos does a fine job, there are plenty of great action scenes, shoot-outs, one of the finest car chases you'll ever see with exploding petrol tankers, flipping cars, cars jumping up & down on humpback bridges along with spectacular crashes & there's even the obligatory weapons montage sequence as Stallone tools himself up for the job ahead! There's even some tacky Pepsi cola product placement. The overriding message of Cobra is to fight violence you need to use violence, in fact you need to be more violent & brutal than your adversary. Oh, & shoot everyone in sight as well. The film tries to say something about the inadequacies of the American legal system & that society needs to get tough & Cobra is used as some sort of epitaph for this message. Cobra is also a film which will outrage the politically correct amongst you, I loved the scene at the end when the stuffy PC cop who thinks even criminals have rights goes to shake Cobra's hand & Cobra smacks him round the face! I thought the whole idea behind that scene of fighting back against political correctness with good old fashioned violence was fantastic! Cobra is also a nicely shot film with some attractive cinematography.Technically the film is good with high production values, superb overblown set-piece action scenes & good location shooting. Shot on location in Los Angeles. Here in the UK during the 80's & 90's the BBFC were notorious for cutting films, in Cobra they demanded a 4 second cut at the end when a man is doused in petrol & set alight. Almost all the actual detail of the act is still present but for some bizarre reason they demanded the line uttered by Cobra 'you have the right to remain silent' be cut in it's entirety, all of the violence, blood, bad language & weapon use is still present in the film but not that line of dialogue. Does that make any sense to anyone out there? The acting is alright, thankfully Nielsen only has a few lines while Stallone is just perfect for a role like this. Stallone & Nielsen were married at the time Cobra was filmed.Cobra is just a brilliant 80's action fest & it's as simple & straight forward as that. I loved it, I loved it's action & violence, I liked the story, I liked the cheesy dialogue, I liked Stallone in it & I just thought it was a great film that entertains every time I've seen it. Why was a sequel never made?",Cobra
21,dbborroughs,One of the worst films ever made,1,5 October 2009,"Stallone plays a cop named Cobretti who has to look after a woman who is hunted by a gang who kills everyone and anything in their path.I liked this when it came out. I remember watching it in theaters and on video tape and liking it well enough. Recently I sat down and watched it again on cable. Oh, my word this movie is awful. Its so arch and so heavy handed that even if it was suppose to be a joke it funny for all of the wrong reasons. Its TERRIBLE. Actually its so far in the parody world has to have become camp. Actually its become really bad camp. Its every cliché you've ever seen played painfully straight. Your jaw will hang open. Forget any notion that this is reality, that goes out the window with the notion of this huge gang that is killing everyone in spectacular bloody fashion and no one catching on. Add to it wooden non-performances and action thats silly instead of exciting and you have a really painful experience.Its a clear example of why you can never underestimate what will be big at the box office because this was a big hit.I'd avoid it unless you like really bad movies.",Cobra
22,utgard14,"""This is where the law stops...and I start.""",7,31 October 2015,"The criminals are winning and our wussy justice system isn't helping matters. Enter Marion ""Cobra"" Cobretti (Sylvester Stallone), a no-nonsense matchstick-chewing mirror shades-wearing cop who isn't afraid to break the rules if it means getting scumbags off the streets. Over the course of the movie, Cobra blows away just about everything that can be blown away while still finding time to romance the model (Brigitte Nielsen) he's in charge of keeping safe. There's nowhere safer than Cobra's bed, sister! In the end he faces off against the deadly Night Slasher (Brian Thompson), the leader of a group of psycho serial killers.Terrifically cheesy '80s actioner, full of over-the-top violence, one-liners, and more badassery than any movie you'll see released today. From the opening scene where Cobra stops a hostage situation in a grocery store to the classic car chase where Cobra does miraculous things with that beast of a 1950 Mercury he drives, this is just one awesome piece of entertainment. Sly is greatness, Brigitte never looked better, and Brian Thompson is one helluva creepy bad guy. The supporting cast includes Reni Santoni, Lee Garlington, Art LaFleur, and Andrew Robinson (perhaps in a nod to Cobra's thematic forerunner, Dirty Harry). The soundtrack includes songs from Miami Sound Machine, John Cafferty, and Gladys Knight. One of the movie's many highlights is a montage, set to Robert Tepper's ""Angel of the City,"" that features Sly and his partner hitting the streets looking for information on the Night Slasher while Brigitte Nielsen does a photo session with a bunch of robots. Tell me this movie wasn't made by the gods!Stallone's screenplay is full of quotable lines and effectively includes nearly every action movie cliché you can think of. The story is very loosely based on the novel Fair Game, which was made into a truly terrible movie in the '90s starring Cindy Crawford and William Baldwin. That stinker did have nudity from Cindy Crawford, however, and nudity is about the only thing this one's missing. Obviously this isn't a movie for sensitive types or the film snob crowd. It's a fun slice of the '80s; a wonderful guilty pleasure that should put a smile on the face of any viewer who appreciates action movies like they used to be.",Cobra

24,zardoz-13,Pride of the Zombie Squad,8,24 November 2010,"""Rambo 2"" director George P. Cosmatos' ""Cobra"" represents Sylvester Stallone's stab at a derivative ""Dirty Harry"" type thriller. Energetically directed and concisely edited for maximum impact, this stylist crime saga about a tough-as-nails, maverick cop who whips the worst scum that society can ante up is a standard-issue law and order epic. Stallone resembles an iconoclastic Long Ranger in sunglasses, arriving on the scene in a vintage black Mercury, with a match in his lips, and an automatic pistol tucked into his waistband. The ""Dirty Harry"" reference is unmistakable, particularly because Andrew Robinson and Reno Santoni starred in the original Clint Eastwood classic. Loosely based on Paula Gosling's novel, the Sylvester Stallone screenplay finds our hero, Lieutenant Marion 'Cobra' Cobretti, assigned to protect a comely beauty that saw the chief serial killer of the gang without his mask. These murderous fiends like to gather in dark places and clash axes in a ritualistic ceremony. Plug-ugly Brian Thompson plays a menacing killer with an exotic looking knife who gives Cobra a run for his money. The villains are about as outrageous as Stallone is cool. ""Cobra"" boasts some large-scale action scenes, especially with Stallone at the wheel of his Mercury, driving backwards and blasting away at the opposition with a submachine gun. The soundtrack brims with characteristic 1980s era tunes, such as Robert Tepper's ""Angel of the City"" and Jean Beauvoir's ""Feel the Heat."" When a maniac on a motorcycle (Marco Rodríguez of ""The Crow"") shoots up a supermarket and the cops cannot convince him to surrender, Captain Sears (Art La Fleur of ""Zone Troopers"") calls on Cobra (Sylvester Stallone of ""Rocky"") to eliminate their problem. Buttoned down, bespectacled Detective Monte (Andrew Robinson of ""Dirty Harry"") objects to Cobra's gratuitous methods of handling criminals. Basically, Cobra advocates terminal justice and he metes it out to the villains. Like Dirty Harry, he takes no prisoners, and society is better off for him. Cobra corners the psycho who has been killing off shoppers with a sawed-0ff, automatic shotgun that he loves to wield with devastating accuracy until he starts shooting at our hero. Ultimately, in a Dirty Harry confrontation where the killer holds the lives of hostages in his grip, Cobra takes the villain down with a knife in the stomach. The shotgun maniac lets Cobra know that he is a member of a New World order. In other words, he belongs to a faction of supremacists who want to wipe out the weak and so the strongest rule society. Meanwhile, a notorious Night Slasher is operating in Los Angeles.As trendy model Ingrid Knudsen (Brigitte Nielsen of ""Red Sonja"") is driving through town, she passes the scene of a murder and the Night Slasher (Brian Thompson of ""Sudden Impact"") tries to halt her because she has seen him without his stocking mask. The Night Slasher's girlfriend, Nancy Stalk (Lee Garlington of ""Field of Dreams""), happens to be a policewoman, and she finds Ingrid's information so her evil boyfriend can kill her. Miraculously, Ingrid survives a massacre in the underground garage where she was posing for photographs with robots. Ingrid's annoying photographer Dan (David Rasche of TV's ""Sledgehammer"") is hitting on her when a felon with an ax takes several chunks out of him. Naturally, the first ax blow cracks a pipe and steam spews out to conceal the blood and gore but serves as a metaphor for his sudden loss of blood. Cobra and his partner, Sergeant Gonzales (Reno Santoni of ""Dirty Harry""), question Ingrid at the hospital and get a description of her assailant. Cobra runs home to run everything through his computer so he can get a line on the killer. Meantime, Gonzales gets a call that Cobra wants him at the hospital. Later, Ingrid narrowly escapes death when the Night Slasher masquerades as a custodian at the hospital and futilely tries to carve her up with his exotic knife. Gonzales calls Cobra and both men scramble back to the hospital, but the resourceful Ingrid triggers an alarm and the Night Slasher retreats. The Night Slasher and his army attack Cobra and Ingrid while they are cruising through Los Angeles. Initially, they smash up Gonzales' car so he cannot pursue them and then two car with gunmen attack Cobra in his Mercury. At one point, Cobra puts his big Mercury in reverse and riddles the truckload of villains behind him with submachine gun fire and they vanish in an explosion. Cobra tries to catch up with the car carrying the Night Slasher, but the Slasher riddles two tanker truck enveloped Los Angeles in sheets of flame. Cosmatos does a good job of staging this high-octane shoot-out. During a meeting after the attempt on Ingrid's life, Cobra announces that he plans to take her out of the city. One of the chief city officials likes this strategy because nothing can happen now in L.A. Just as they are pulling out of town with Ingrid, Gonzales describes Cobra to her as ""a fugitive from the fifties."" Nevertheless, he points out that Cobra ""sure is great at catching psychos. He's the pride of the zombie squad."" Gonzales explains that the zombie squad is ""the bottom line."" Like Dirty Harry, Cobra gets every dirty job. Anyway, Cobra takes Stalk, Gonzales and Ingrid to a foundry town and they hole up in a roadside motel the Cross Roads Motor Court in San Remos. Cobra grows suspicious of Stalk when he notices that she is making calls from a coin phone. Yeah, this is a vintage thriller, no cell phones. The Night Slasher assembles a leather-clad army of armed ruffians on motorcycles and they head out to obliterate Cobra. Cosmatos generates suspense by cross-cutting between the army coming to attack Cobra and images of Cobra preparing his arsenal for combat. This blow-out of an action scene gives Cosmatos another opportunity to stage scenes of wholesale slaughter with Stallone mowing down the opposition with a submachine gun. ""Cobra"" contains more gunfire than humor.",Cobra
25,view_and_review,Dirty Harry 80's Style,7,2 August 2019,"I like Cobra. He's a cool, no nonsense cop that kills bad guys. But let's be honest; he and Dirty Harry are one and the same.What were Dirty Harry's characteristics? A rough around the edges, no nonsense cop that killed bad guys and had a disdain for the laws that helped bad guys go free. That was also Cobra. Cobra was a 1980's version of Dirty Harry.Switching gears: who knew this movie would be psychic? The movie starts with an active shooter in a grocery store who's shooting for no good reason. That's the last 15 years or so in a nutshell. Just a few days ago we had a gunman at the Gilroy Garlic Festival kill and injure a bunch of people. The biggest difference between the movie shooter and the shooters we have in real life is that the movie shooter was shooting mostly produce, real life shooters aren't shooting produce.The main story of Cobra was a killer (or killers) randomly attacking and killing women. The killer was dubbed the Night Slasher which I'm sure was a play on the Night Stalker who was active in California from 1984 to 1985. One woman, Ingrid (Brigitte Nielsen), got away from the Night Slasher and had to be protected by none other than Cobra. I know what you're thinking: ""the hero got the girl."" I contend that she kisses all the guys though so he's not special.This was a shoot 'em up bang-bang movie working its way towards the inevitable showdown. Cobra gets style points because anyone can shoot but not many can do it while looking cool.",Cobra

Fortunately, all the baddies have been issued with ammunition which is programmed to destroy only stuff and never harm a person, whereas Stallone has been canny enough to collect a stock of bullets which are guaranteed to take out a baddie with every shot.Stallone wrote this nonsense, and sometimes you can even understand what he's saying (although you often wish you didn't). The direction is obvious and poor, much of the acting is execrable, and the action is absolutely preposterous.And yet I quite enjoyed it in a dozy, brain-dead kind of way.",Cobra

Needless to say, the local SWAT team is immediately called onto the scene but rather than risking even more deaths by a massed frontal assault the decision is made to send in one particular police officer by the name of ""Lieutenant Marion 'Cobra' Cobretti"" (Sylvester Stallone). Once inside the store he manages to confront the gunman and ends up killing him before he can activate a bomb he was holding in his left hand. The story then shifts to a serial killer known as the ""Night Slasher"" (Brian Thompson) having already murdered at least a dozen people in a grisly manner and Cobra being reluctantly given permission to conduct his own investigation. It's during this time that he learns about a fashion model named ""Ingrid Knudsen"" (Brigitte Nielsen) barely escaping an attack by several masked men and upon further questioning he begins to suspect that she may have been a witness to the Night Slasher himself. Accordingly, both he and Sergeant Gonzales decide to act as bodyguards for her since they believe he will target her again. What they don't realize, however, is that a female police officer serving with them named ""Nancy Stalk"" (Lee Garlington) is a member of the Night Slasher's gang and is supplying him with all the information necessary for him to kill his intended target. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this had to be one of the most ridiculous action films I have ever seen with each scene being more preposterous than the one before it. Throw in an extremely hollow plot, bad acting and an awful script and it's not difficult to figure out why this particular movie was nominated for six Razzie Awards-including one for Worst Picture, Worst Actor (Sylvester Stallone) and Worst Actress (Brigitte Nielsen). Admittedly, it does have some good stunts and pyrotechnics but even so the obvious flaws mentioned previously were simply too much to ignore and I have rated this film accordingly. Below average.",Cobra
28,Wizard-8,Awesomely bad (and hilarious),6,9 February 1999,"What was Stallone thinking of when he wrote this? Everyone in this movie is an idiot, and there's no one sympathetic. Robinson's liberal character just seems to be in the movie so he'll get punched at the end. Cobra is a particularly repulsive character - the first glimpse of him shows a close up of his five o'clock shadow, uncombed hair, and a match in his mouth - ugh! Stallone has an acceptable voice in real life, but he gives Cobra a low, sometimes hard to make out, groan in his voice that makes it sound like he's talking in his sleep. The bikers are stupid even for bikers - why do they clank axes over their heads? Why don't they get out of the way when Stallone machine guns from the truck near the end? Movie also contains some of the most blatant product plugs in history, for Pepsi and ""Toys R Us"" (the latter by playing an _entire commercial_ on a TV Cobra watches.)However, I will freely admit that I enjoyed COBRA - as a so-bad-its-good movie. Sure you'll groan several times - but you'll also find a lot of unintended laughs and giggles. It's even funnier than it could have been, because Stallone writer/star and director Cosmatos take the movie incredibly seriously. Plus, the fact Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus produced it makes it a must see. It should be noted, however, that the cinematography isn't bad, and a few action sequences are acceptable as well.",Cobra

He must go on the run with her, if he has any chance of saving her life, and wiping out the gang, who are in hot pursuit...Though I got a huge kick out of the Cobra(his only film appearance to date), who is an interesting and appealing character, it is a shame that this film becomes so routine and absurd toward the end.

Cobretti plans to move the witness upstate, but with inside information, the thugs follow them......This was a really strange move for Stallone. On first appearances, this looks like your bog standard eighties action movie, all explosions and shootings. It's true, there is plenty of this in the film, but it has a really evil sadistic edge to it.Any scene involving the Slasher is eerie and downright un-nerving, something that action movies didn't do in the eighties, so in some really bizarre way, this could have paved the way for the more gritty movies we see now.Stallone is as good as ever, and if your a fan, I'm sure you've seen this a dozen times anyway. Thompson steals the show as the bad guy, and there are times when you really do question yourself if Stallone will save the day.Mrs Stallone just stands there looking good, and the action is as you'd expect, but a little tougher and brutal.So its a fine action movie, just a little bit leftfield, and the book was remade yet again, starring Cindy Crawford called Fair Game, and bizarrely enough, they are almost different movies.Plus its the best film ever to have the hero cut himself the smallest slice of pizza in the world whilst listening to Gloria Estefan...",Cobra

I can't believe it is ranked so low here, granted it is not all that original or special, but hey it was not boring either.  Cobra (Stallone's character) is on the search for a strange serial killer, who turns out to be some cult that believes only the strong should live and be in control.

32,Wuchakk,Comic book 80's action schlock with Sly Stallone,5,26 October 2015,"Released in 1986, ""Cobra"" stars Sylvester Stallone as Lieutenant 'Cobra' Cobretti, an atypical LAPD cop who investigates serial murders by the so-called Night Slasher (Brian Thompson). Reni Santoni plays Cobra's partner and Brigitte Nielsen his potential babe.The Story goes that the Stallone's script for ""Cobra"" was to be ""Beverly Hills Cop"" with Stallone in the role that Eddie Murphy played in that 1984 movie, but Stallone dropped out two weeks before shooting because the producers insisted that his ideas were over-budget. A couple days later Eddie signed on resulting in massive rewrites to include his witty comedic flair. Despite these last-minute changes ""Beverly Hills Cop"" was a great mid-80s cop thriller and the #1 film in the USA in 1984 and #2 worldwide.So Sly took his script and made ""Cobra,"" which simply isn't in the same league as ""Beverly Hills Cop."" It has a palpable comic book schlock tone and pales in comparison to all five of the Dirty Harry flicks and 1977's ""The Gauntlet."" This is surprising since Stallone was riding a wave of success at the time with ""Rambo II"" and ""Rocky IV"" being massive hits a year earlier.This isn't to say that there aren't any entertaining aspects to ""Cobra,"" because there are several. For one, Cobretti is the epitome of cool. Secondly, Thompson plays a great villain frothing at the mouth with malevolence. Thirdly, there are some thrilling action sequences, overdone though some of them are, like the ridiculous car chase. Fourthly, the climax in the factory is so effective that 1991's ""Terminator 2"" ripped it off. And, lastly, the role of Ingrid (Nielsen) is tastefully done. She doesn't get naked once and there's no gratuitous sex scene, plus they try to give her a personality and she gets in on the action at the end. She was a pretty good ""damsel in distress"" and it's cute seeing the chemistry of Nielsen and Sly as they were a couple in real life and married from 1985-1987.While these positives may make ""Cobra"" an 80's cult flick or guilty pleasure, they don't turn it into a good movie. It's too Grade B schlocky for that. Just because you like it doesn't mean it's a good movie.The film runs 87 minutes and was shot in the Los Angeles area.GRADE: C+",Cobra
33,The_Void,The poor man's Dirty Harry,5,19 August 2004,"Taking obvious influence from films such as Dirty Harry, Cobra tells the story of a maverick cop determined to bring down a cult that are brutally murdering members of the local population. Sylvester Stallone stars as Marion ""Cobra"" Cobretti, the sunglass wearing action hero extraordinaire with, you guessed it, a bad attitude. Stallone gets to chew on lots of cheesy dialogue, as does the rest of the cast, which is most probably down to the fact that Stallone wrote it. Starring alongside Stallone is Andrew Robinson, whom horror fans will recognise instantly from the simply sublime British horror flick; Hellraiser. Andrew also starred in the aforementioned Dirty Harry, which, as I said; this film took it's premise, although none of what made it good. Overall, the film is corny and it has almost nothing that you couldn't find somewhere else, and done better than it is here. One of the worst things about the movie is its use of music, which is alarmingly awful. The 80's has never been known for good music, and this film is a testament as to why. I don't know why they would want to use the music the way it is used in this film, in any film. Silly songs over corny acting has never, and will never work.Despite all that I've said so far; this film does have some redeeming qualities that come in the form of the set pieces that ensue when the evil cult that Stallone is working against are chasing their victims. There are shots of them opening up cars and axing the people inside, one scene sees a man bash a door down with a knife and his foot to get at the girl inside etc. Some of them are genuinely suspenseful, and my only qualm is that it cuts out before the 'money shot' (we don't get to see the gore). The film also features a standard (for this type of film) car chase. The one here is extremely over the top. Sometimes, being over the top can work, but it was just TOO over the top. Big vans exploding with a couple of shots, Stallone manoeuvring his car into reverse and back again in motion, and in an instant, and more all feature.Despite it's small redeeming features, Cobra isn't really worth watching and I would only recommended it to people with nothing better to do.",Cobra
34,mm-39,Comic book junk food for the mind,6,27 April 2001,"Spoiler Well the Stallone bashers are out in full force for this film.  I do not mind it; Stallone does comic book action heros well, Rambo, Judge Dredge, etc.  I like these forms of escapism, take them for what they are junk food for the mind.  This film is not a steak, its a 7-11 pizza sub sandwich, which goes well with a coke.  The begaining is great, after that the story laps into a comic book style, with a high body count ending, along with the big entertaining action movie fight for the climax.  I gave it a 6, as I get older the film gets cheesier like the Pizza sub, but in the macho 80's as a teenager this film would be a 8.  Even as I get older I still watch this one on TBS, and can not stop watching it no matter how many times they show it, until my wife makes me change the channel.  Its fun to watch, but its not for everyone, and all the Stallone basher out there, you crap on this guy, but have you seen Hard to kill or Out for Justice by Steagal I mean those are some pretty desperate low budget films.",Cobra

Stallone's that great '80s badass, shooting first, taking the law into his own hands . . . and yet you can't help but laugh at the getup (those jeans, that matchstick hanging out of his mouth). And who eats pizza with gloves on? Really, I've got nothing bad to say about this - it knows how absurd all of this is and I enjoyed it.

37,ShadeGrenade,Stallone gets snake-bite!,7,29 August 2011,"When I wrote a less-than flattering review of the remake of 'The Stepford Wives', someone responded: ""you just don't get it, do you? Remakes are a part of the New World Order. Quit complaining and learn to accept them!"". My wife had to restrain me from phoning the Mental Health Crisis Team to send half a dozen or so nurses armed with a thousand Clonazepam tablets to the author of that comment. I had assumed remakes to be a product of an industry which is creatively bankrupt, but no, apparently, some consider them a miracle of the modern age. I feel queasy whenever I hear someone mention 'New World Orders' because its what Hitler and his chums wanted in 1939. The villains of this 1986 thick ear cop movie are a sect of serial killers who also think of themselves as 'the future', led by the 'Night Slasher' ( Brian Thompson ), and view anyone standing in their way as enemies of progress. A strange lot they are too, when they're not butchering innocent people, they're banging axes together in dark rooms. After top fashion model 'Ingrid' ( Brigitte Nielsen ) is attacked, she gets a good enough look at their leader to be able to make an identification. To protect her, the police send for 'Marion Cobretti' ( Sylvester Stallone ) of the zombie squad. Known as 'Cobra', he is a cool guy who drives a car with the licence plate 'AWSOM', wears dark glasses, has a matchstick sticking out of his mouth at all times, and eats pizza without first removing his gloves. He also shares Dirty Harry's attitude when it comes to catching criminals - shoot first, ask questions later ( don't suppose he gets many answers ). They head into the country, but the 'New Order' gives chase.There is little one can say about this movie - it was adapted by Sly himself from Paula Gosling's novel 'Fair Game' - and was his first since the hugely successful 'Rambo: First Blood Part 2', also directed by the late George Pan Cosmatos. Its mindless for the most part, but manages to be fairly enjoyable. Guns fire, bodies gush blood, fenders crumple, all to the tune of pounding '80's rock. The action scenes are good, particularly the car chase ( how good to watch an action film with no C.G.I. whatever ). Even I found myself yelling at the screen: ""Go on Cobra, shoot the f####r!"". Sly is his usual macho self, dispensing his lines in the same quick-fire manner as bullets. Nielsen, of course, married Sly, changed her hair colour, and had breast implants, before he divorced her. That's showbiz for you. Andrew Robinson - 'Scorpio' from 'Dirty Harry' ( 1971 ) - plays 'Monte' - a liberal-minded cop who objects to Cobra's violent methods and complains about him at every opportunity. A good actor wasted in a thankless role.It was produced by Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus - the Cannon Group - who churned out a string of cheap movies in the '80's, such as 'King Solomon's Mines' ( with Richard Chamberlain and Sharon Stone ), 'Lifeforce' ( a bad movie classic ), and the appalling 'Superman 4 - The Quest For Peace'. 'Cobra' is one of their better offerings. No sequels followed surprisingly. So, members of the New World Order, enjoy your remakes, just keep one eye for out a man in shades carrying a gun with a laser telescopic sight!",Cobra

He not only looks the part, but also plays the buffed up hero with great energy. Brigitte Nielsen is fair, while Brian Thompson makes an intimidating villain. Reni Santoni deserves a mention.

39,thesar-2,Cobra Didn't Command,4,7 April 2014,"Granted, if the How Did This Get Made? podcast wasn't around, I would've never seen Cobra.I understand this made a lot of money back in the 1980s. Let me tell you, from a first-time viewer, it belongs in the 1980s. It was many of the 1980s action/comedies all slapped together, only without any humor. Intentionally, that is.I'm being harsh. This movie isn't terrible, per se. It has its problems – many of them, but it's the classic ""Leave your brain at the door"" meshed with ""Forget all the other countless movies it rips off."" So, if you can manage those feats, have fun viewing.Apparently, ""Cobra"" runs by his own rules while being a cop – even though we barely ever see him do anything completely unreasonable (SEE: Jack Bauer in any season of 24) – and he's faced with saving one nothing witness from a gang who, I guess, wants to change the face of the world by means of clanking metal together.Okay, I tease, but seriously, I am not too far off. There's also an inside (person) and plenty of failed chances to knock off our heroes for them to always live long enough to deliver a message against bad eating.Fine, this movie is fairly funny if you watch it for how serious it wants to be. And at 87 minutes and deathly 1980s filmmaking, it's worth a Rifftrax kind of night.* * * Final thoughts: I had this assignment (well, um, that I set for myself) to watch all the movies the How Did This Get Made? podcast made fun of. This was on the list and that's my excuse. But, I still recommend this as long as you do listen to their take. It's fairly interesting and enormously hilarious.",Cobra

41,sol1218,Sly in a I am the law type of movie,5,10 July 2004,"Being a member of the ""Zombie Squad"" Let. Marion ""Cobra"" Cobretti is the meanest as well as toughest cop in the city. In the movie ""Cobra"" Let. Cobretti has his hands full when he takes on a gang of ax wheeling psychos who call themselves ""The Way of the New World"" led by their leader the ""Night Slasher"" Brian Thompson. Like in most movies like ""Cobra"" Let. Cobretti always get in trouble with his bosses as well as the local liberal bleeding-heart lawyers and news reporters for doing things ""His Way"". Let Cobretti wastes the bad guys without the benefit of a lawyer or trial as we get to see him in the opening scene of the movie shooting to pieces a ""Way of the New World"" psycho who crashed a supermarket and gunned down a number of shoppers. These ""Way of the New World"" psychos are going around the city axing people to death and one of the lucky one's who got away from being split in half by them is beautiful fashion model Ingrid, Brigitte Nielsen, who also got a real good look at the 'Night Slasher"" and can identify him. It's around the safety of Ingrid and having her protected by Let. Cobretti, of course, and then be around to finger the ""Way of the New World"" leader that the plot in the movie ""Cobra"" is built around. The ""Night Slasher"" and his gang of cut-ups spend the rest of the film trying to get their hands on Ingrid and turn her into confetti, but they have only one small problem: They have to get past Let. Cobretti to get to her. What spoiled the movie ""Cobra"" for me is that the bad guys are so cartoon-like and one-dimensional as well as really having no reason for their murderous actions against society. The movie never really explains just what the heck the ""Way of the New World"" gang is all about? We see them throughout the film driving around mostly on motorcycles with panty-hose over their heads and murdering people by hacking them to death and about the only reason we get from their leader the ""Night Slasher"" for doing that is that their victims don't measure up or fit into the ""New World"" that their creating. Sly Stallone gives a real good Mr. Cool type performance as the ultra-cool-cat and take-no-bull-from-anyone Let. Marion Cobretti. Still Stallone is weighed down in the movie trying to carry his then girlfriend and co-star Brigitte Nielsen who's nice to look at but she'll never be mistaken for Bette Davis in the acting department.Also by then, 1986, the soft-on-crime angle and cops who don't go by the rules to get the job done movies were already wearing thin with the American public. Tough on crime politicians and law enforcement personnel were being indited and jailed for being in many cases worse then the criminals that they were supposed to be fighting against.",Cobra
42,Robert_duder,Average...even by 80's action standards,6,1 September 2013,"I have become a raging Stallone fan. Always adored the guy but now I'm just going back and reliving everything he has ever done and loving every minute of it. I seem to remember being completely enamoured by Cobra when I first saw it 20ish years ago for the first time. But I have watched a lot of action films since then and in the last few weeks so a certain standard was already set. Cobra feels unpolished in nearly every way. It certainly relies on Stallone's charm as an action hero and his machismo which always works. Everything just feels slightly unpolished including the story, the characters, the weak plot. That being said, there are some terrific action scenes, great car chases, and Stallone being Stallone so it deserves at least a watch. It has some classic one liners but they feel just a little bit forced compared to other Stallone actioners. It basically feels like a cash grab that they rushed to throw together. Considering Stallone penned the screenplay I am surprised because he tends to be thorough writer who knows exactly what his audience wants. There are plenty of action scenes, just a weak story.Sylvester Stallone's charisma on screen in undeniable. Even if you hate the guy you have to respect the audience he's built. I found his performance as Cobretti a little underwhelming. He is too dry and seems almost bored with the character. Maybe he's trying to be brooding and tough but it doesn't work in this case. A huge part of the problem with this film and the cast was the casting of Stallone's wife at the time Brigitte Nielsen. Nielsen is atrocious. She seems wide eyed and oblivious to the idea of playing an actual character. Her line delivery is awful and ironically the chemistry between her and Stallone is virtually non-existent. A better actor in this role could have upped the quality of this film. Reni Santoni is good as Cobra's partner but he is also vastly underused. Santoni has a good sarcastic wit and some fun lines and better chemistry with Stallone than Nielsen has but he hardly gets any time on screen which is unfortunate. Brian Thompson looks the part of a great villain but doesn't get a lot to sink his teeth into and so he is mostly forgettable other than looking mean and villainous.George P. Cosmatos has some hit and misses in his career. He was a master at directing the first rate action classic First Blood: Part 2 but also the incredibly cheesy Aliens rip-off Leviathan. I'm not sure he knows how to really craft a great story. This could have been the opportunity to start a whole new Stallone franchise but they simply didn't try hard enough. Some good action scenes and care chases don't make a good film. The story is simply not strong enough and I can't imagine why Stallone didn't work harder on this script. He has written some incredible action films and this simply wasn't one of them. In essence I feel like Cobra should have been more Jack Reacher (an excellently crafted thriller action film) and less tired old Cobretti. An unfortunate miss-step in the action genre. 6/10",Cobra
43,CuriosityKilledShawn,"Absolute, complete, total, utter garbage...but entertaining.",6,4 February 2001,"I remember when Cobra first came out there were posters for it all over the place. I was mesmerized by the simplicity and suggestive nature of them. Stallone, against a red background, chewing a match, with his custom-made pistol tucked under his belt. I'd never seen anyone chew a matchstick before, I'd never seen a laser-targeting machine gun, and the idea of a cop associating himself with an animal was intriguing.In 1988 I rented the VHS tape from the local store. It was one of those old, massive, clamshell cases with the old Warner logo on the side. That night, at the age of 7, I was left alone for a few hours and the movie was merely to keep me amused and out of trouble. It didn't so much amuse me as it did terrify me. For any action-junkie kid born in the 80s the words 'Night Slasher' will be forever carved into your consciousness. This guy, to me, at that age, was the ultimate villain, and pushed the movie out of the action genre and into horror. I developed a fear of strange men driving around in unassuming vans, which I still have. Brian Thompson is utterly bone-chilling in the role.Marion 'Cobra' Cobretti is part of the 'zombie squad', a group of LAPD cops who are the absolute bottom line and will do the jobs that no one else wants. The movie opens with some random psycho holding hostages in a supermarket. 'Call the Cobra' the normal, useless cops say. Cobra arrives in his muscle car and calmly enters the store, sipping some free beer and taunting the psycho before obliterating him, much to the distaste of the wimpy, bleeding-heart liberal media circus who have invaded the scene.Cobra believes that the supermarket psycho is part of a bigger gang, an axe-clanking cult in which members from every facet of society gather in a sewer to clank axes over their heads. Their leader is the Night Slasher, a man who's head is 95% cheekbone and 5% staring, staring, staring eyes. He believes in creating a New World, not the Aldous Huxley kind but the kind which can be achieved, somehow, by murdering random blondes. His latest target is Ingrid (Brigitte Nielsen in a so very not Oscar-winning role), a model who towers over Cobra by a full 4 inches, but she needs his protection and he needs to keep her alive as a witness. Not taking too kindly to having people being able to identify him the Night Slasher rounds up all of his fellow psychos and unleashes World War 3 on California, thus creating thousands more witness in the process, but logic is not this film's strong point.After finding success with Rocky and Rambo, Stallone was clearing trying to create his own spin on Dirty Harry here (the Dirty Harry villain Scorpio even features here as an unhelpful Detective constantly berating Cobra). There is a strong right-wing theme of fighting fire with fire, and that with psychos as utterly demented as the Night Slasher you need someone just as unsympathetic and daring on the right side of the law to combat him. It's so far-fetched, and filled with dozens of logical and physical impossibilities that it makes Commando look like a freakin' documentary. But while Commando was cheerful, upbeat and self-aware, Cobra is deadly, deadly serious and believes itself to be making a serious point of how close society can come to complete anarchy if the Police were not there to keep the psychos off the streets.This would be a fine message for an action picture, but there is a air of sleaziness to the production that spoils it. Many scenes are set in oppressive environments such as parking lots or concrete underpasses which give it a cold, alienating feel more like early James Glickenhaus or Joseph Zito films. Cobra is also produced by the notorious Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus, and directed, mostly, like a pop music video by George Pan Cosmatos. There are lots of quick cuts and fish-eye lens shots. Cosmatos overdoes it with these gimmicks in a few scenes. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. If there was a little more elegance to the production then perhaps the critics might not have been so merciless and it might have aged a bit better too. I realize that this not a Kenneth Branagh film, but it's still too mainstream to be outright exploitation and too sleazy to deliver the conservative message it so desperately wants us to believe in.These days few movies are as straight-up and to-the-point as Cobra. The one-man army theme was the 80s zeitgeist. Before John McClane came along and made the vulnerable hero fashionable audiences preferred the bulletproof, genuine, straight-up tough guy. Cobra has endured a lasting cult following thanks to its undeniable 80s mentality. A film like this would be very, very quickly forgotten in modern times. If you want 87 minutes of entertainment it works, if you want to look beneath the surface at a possibly deeper message, Cobra almost, just barely has one.This film is basically Stallone's Beverly Hills Cop. When he was attached to star as Axel Foley he wanted to make the film more action-orientated. Paramount didn't want to spend so much money on the project so he left, and took his ideas with him. Those ideas were turned into Cobra, despite an on screen credit for 'Based on the novel Fair Game, by Paula Gosling', a novel it bears little resemblance to, which was later turned into its own movie in 1995 (starring Steven Berkoff as the villain, who was also the villain in Beverly Hills Cop and Rambo 2) which is absolutely nothing like Beverly Hills Cop or Cobra. And on top of all that a poster for Cobra can be seen in Beverly Hills Cop 2, which stars Brigitte Nielsen.Try getting your head around that.",Cobra
44,ironhorse_iv,"This movie is the disease, and sadly Stallone wasn't the cure.",5,20 March 2013,"This movie hurts like a snakebite. The screenplay by Stallone was originally written for the film Beverly Hills Cop. When the producers wanted a comedy; Stallone want a serious action-oriented film so they didn't see eye to eye on that. When he left that project, Eddie Murphy was brought in to play the lead role. Stallone took his screenplay and made Cobra instead. It was loosely based on the novel Fair Game by Paula Gosling, which was later filmed under that title in 1995. Both films are nothing like the novel, which is also call 'A Running Duck'. The opening scene to the film Cobra is pretty damn cool, but I can't understand a word, 'Cobra' Marion Cobretti (Sylvester Stallone) is saying about the crime statistics. I had to rewind and listen to Stallone's lines over again just to understand what he says. For the gritty opening narration, this film has quite a bit of quintessential 80's action movie, complete with cheese plot and over the top action. The right wing political message is kinda disturbing. Cobra is a police officer from an never heard of division of the Los Angeles Police Department ""Zombie Squad"". Don't know why he has code name, but he is called into a hostage situation at a grocery store when negotiations fail. Cobretti kills the gunman, but before his death the criminal mumbles about New Order, a group of Neo Fascists lead by leader call the Night Slasher (Brian Thompson) who believe in killing the weak and leaving only the strongest and themselves to live and rule the world. When the New Order fails to kill witness Ingrid Knudsen (Bridget Nielsen) to their latest crime, Cobra is put into the case to protect the witness from the killer group. Isn't it funny that Stallone and Nielson were married, but have no on-screen chemistry at all in this film? Cobra's justified for killing is just ridiculous. Cobra's solution to stopping murderers is becoming a murderer himself. Actually, the message was ""cops should always shoot first and never ask questions because all criminals are over-the-top, one-dimensional psychopaths who do nothing but kill innocent people, and due process only lets them get away with it no matter how bad the crime they did."" Yes, that's the point of the film. What a Dirty Harry rip off. The movie had this Dark Knight type of a story, but rather than show Cobra is better than these murderers. We get Cobra just sinking as low as them. Honestly, Cobra kills more people than the New Order and Night Slasher kill combined. No really, Cobra must have kill 40's somewhat people, as the New Order probably kill like 20 people in the film. Yes, this is the hero, people. The action movie is full of clichés like things that would never blow up, blowing up for no reasons, high body count, and cheese one-liners. The movie doesn't get any better, with all the Pepsi product placement in this. Nothing makes people thirstier for Pepsi than seeing people shot in the face with a shotgun. Yes, this has to be one of the worst product placement ever. It's like Dr. Pepper being put in the background in Schindler's List. It's doesn't work. The movie is still a good B List action flick. If you don't take it serious, you might find it interesting. Still, sadly this movie and Sylvester Stallone is selling something that isn't worth watching. It does makes you dumber after watching it. The Snake oil salesman has strike venom again.",Cobra
45,slightlymad22,A Missed Opportunity,6,9 January 2016,"Continuing my plan to watch every Sly Stallone movie in order, I come to Cobra.Plot In A Paragraph: Cobra (Stallone) a tough cop, who does things his own way, must protect a witness from a murderous gang led by the Night SlasherThis was Sly's attempt at a Dirty Harry type movie/franchise (right down to the opening, outright ripping off Magnum Force's opening) However an out of control ego (Its rumoured none of the supporting cast or crew were allowed to talk to Stallone during filming, insisting on his then wife being the female lead) and an attempt to make more money costs the movie dear. The original cut over the movie was over 2 hours long. Due to concerns it might not be a hit, the final cut was 84 minutes, thereby increasing the number of screenings per day. Some of the more violent scenes were also cut to get a lower rating. A lot of plot was either removed or sped up while most of the violence and nearly every death was edited or depicted off-screen, resulting in numerous continuity errors and plot holes. We never find much out about the axe banging cult (a mix of business men in suits and tough bikers who all brandish the same tattoo) or the ""New World"" that the main villain talks about. What we do get is a lot of montages, with Sly looking tough and moody behind his shades or cool and moody behind his shades. Stallones new wife (Bridgette Neilson) isn't left out either, she gets a solo montage of her modelling various outfits during a photo shoot.George P Cosmotos (Rambo: First Blood Part 2) was directing Stallone again, and (like in their previous collaboration) he does a good job of making Stallone look good. Which, along with the fact that Stallone could control him, is probably why he was hired. The movie is based on the novel 'Fair Game', once Stallone had rewrote it (which seems to be a bad habit of his) it bears zero resemblance to the source novel. Whilst it has a few good lines, most of the dialogue is awful, and it is poorly acted by most of the cast, and the less said about some of the editing the better!! Stallone does what he does best, (although the one man army works well with Rambo, it's laughable here) and looks cool doing it.

When the gang keeps on their trace, Cobra suspects an insider might be one of the gang members.

Get a taste of the decade of the excesses. A generation grow up watching films like these and enjoyed a lot even if the plots were a little bit poor or corny, or the dialogs were so cheap that's laughable, guilty pleasures to some. I remember seeing it many years ago, liked it but it didn't stuck in my memory (only Sly's car was hard to forget, looked like an ambulant eggplant). Watching again this year there was something there that made my enjoy it more than the first time. What was that? The action flicks of that era were so much better than the ones we have now, even the weakest ones.I don't see much need in detailing the plot but here we go, you've seen it before. The toughest guy in town is a reckless cop by the name of Marion Cobretti (Sylvester Stallone) and he's the kind of guy the good cops call only in last case, when no other alternative can be used. As he says to the bad guys: ""You're the disease, and I'm the cure."" His mission now is to protect an important witness (Brigitte Nielsen) of the most dangerous criminal of the moment, the Night Slasher (played by Brian Thompson, an cute/ugly face, don't ask me how to describe such happening). The great trick here is this: the police thinks Night Slasher is one criminal rather than thinking he's an whole entity with people from the police force backing up for him. But Cobra's the big hero, underrated by his superiors who always make him look down, but he'll investigate the case and rescue the woman for all the trouble that comes near her.Routine like any other masterpiece of the genre, ""Cobra"" stands out with elegant sequences like the Slasher attack in the hospital; the fight at Cobra's house and the memorable final duel. The opening in the supermarket is a little bit pointless but quite tense. Reni Santoni playing Sly's humored partner deserves some recognition. The only thing that bothers me, except some bad acting here and there, is how short this movie was. A few more situations could be thrown in here (and for all I known David Rasche had his part reduced, he simply pops on the screen then gets killed. Go figure).Can't see any big problem with this movie. Sure, it's not one of Stallone's greatest but it's a good one. Way better than ""Spy Kids 3-D"" It's there to offer some distraction, some laughs and plenty of action. As far as I'm concerned, that's all some of us really need sometimes. 8/10",Cobra
48,tomgillespie2002,An amusing reminder of the day when the answer to crime was to simply shoot at it,4,10 November 2012,"""Crime is the disease. Meet the cure."" So reads the tag-line for Sylvester Stallone's now cult favourite Cobra, a quote that really sums up the whole action genre of the 1980's. While America was still suffering from the demoralising and embarrassing defeat in Vietnam, audiences were calling out for all-American heroes that could kick ass again, and prove that they would stand up to any potential threats. Therefore, violent criminals were the target (as well as the Viet Cong in frequent vets-return-to-Vietnam-for-one-last-mission movies), shown as mindless thugs that needed stamping out. Enter Marion 'Cobra' Cobretti (Stallone) - tight jeans, reflective sunglasses, leather gloves, and match-in-mouth.After a shooting spree in a shopping mall, police negotiations fail, so Cobretti steps in to take down the mad man. Before he dies, the gunman informs Cobretti that there is a new order in town, a neo-fascist group that is wiping out the weak in order for the strong and powerful to prevail. A series of gruesome murders occur, and after witnessing the group commit a murder, led by a hulking man listed simply as the Night Slasher (Brian Thompson), model Ingrid (Brigitte Nielsen) finds her life in danger. Faced with opposition from the suit upstairs Detective Monte (Andrew Robinson), Cobretti takes Ingrid into his protection, but with the suspicion of a police insider, Cobretti and his partner Gonzales (Reni Santoni) find themselves relentlessly pursued by the axe-wielding maniacs.In the modern-day world of liberalism and grass-roots problem-solving, it's quite difficult to empathise with Cobretti's shoot first, ask questions later approach. He is really nothing more than a vigilante with a badge, without a care for the lives of others as he blows up and shoots his way through busy streets. I know this is Hollywood Action Cinema, and not to be taken as anything but mindless entertainment, but this is a direct reflection of America's right-wing attitudes of the time. Therefore the bad guys are given no character depth whatsoever, and is unclear as to what they're exactly trying to achieve (apart from standing in what looks like a warehouse banging axes together above their head).This was popular at the Razzie Awards, picking up nominations for Worst Film and Worst Actor for Stallone, but an extremely successful box- office showed that audiences didn't care, as long as s**t was getting blown up. The critical hammering it received is unfair, however, as it really isn't that bad at all. The questionable morals aside, it has some half-decent action scenes, and the film is rather nicely shot by cinematographer Ric Waite, who captures the carnage in crisp blue neon. A mainstream movie would never get away with such a ham-fisted (anti)hero in the modern age - our leads tend to be much more complex nowadays - so Cobra is an amusing reminder of the days when the answer to crime was to simply shoot at it.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Cobra
49,tarbosh22000,"""Cobra"" is a classic 80's film!",10,12 May 2010,"""This is where the law stops and I start!"" Thank you for reading the review for one of the all-time Comeuppance fan favorites! ""Cobra"" is awesome for so many reasons and the standard by which all other like-minded movies are judged.""Cobra"" is a classic 80's film and everything about this movie is a recipe for success.Here's a rundown\plot description: 1. First, Sly does a voice-over consisting of lines like: ""In America there's a burglary every 11 seconds, an armed robbery every 65 seconds, a violent crime every 25 seconds, A murder every 24 minutes, and 250 rapes a day."" This was clearly added after the fact to pad out the running time. That being said, I'm glad the movie ran short because this opening sequence is both hilarious and sets the mood perfectly. And it's downright informative! Isn't that why you watch films like this? 2. Next, start with a ""Cop on the Edge"" name like Cobra.... but with a trademarked Stallone twist his first name is Marion! He also cuts pizza with scissors, among other quirky actions such as putting his daily newspaper under his grill for safe keeping.3. The first scene has Marion blowing away a robber in a supermarket. The one-liner is: ""I don't shop here!"" Genius! Intermission! Can you feel the heat? 4. The bad guy must have no lines (until the end), and no motive for killing anybody, but does it anyway.5. There are no other stars in Stallone's film and he casts his previous wife Brigitte Nielsen as his love interest.6. The chase scene consists of Cobra shooting bikers for 20 minutes! The infamous ""orange grove chase"" is padded out so ridiculously long it's laugh-out-loud funny. It's like an old-school video game where bad guys that are all dressed alike and look alike just keep coming and coming endlessly. Do these people honestly believe they can kill COBRA? Come on! 7. Last but not least, we have to mention the soundtrack. I own it on CD. You should too, if you don't already. The theme of the movie is ""The Voice Of American Sons"" by John Cafferty. It makes no sense at all during the course of the film. Cobra doesn't even have a son...he just has beard stubble and shoots people.In the end, if you have an attitude problem (""just a little one""), you need to own the DVD of ""Cobra""!

50,zkonedog,Needed To Know More About The Cobra,3,10 March 2017,"After the success of his Rocky and Rambo film franchises, Sylvester Stallone tried to create a similar phenomenon with ""Cobra"". Let's just say that it spawned no sequels.For a basic plot summary, Cobra focuses on ""specialty"" cop Marion ""Cobra"" Cobretti (Stallone), a part of the Zombie Squad, a special unit given nearly free reign to stomp out crime in the big city. While on the case of the seemingly unstoppable Night Slasher (Brian Thompson), Cobra comes across a key eyewitness (Bridgette Nielson) whom he must both protect and help lead him to the killer.The problem with this film is that, at its core, it really just re-hashes some old themes from cop flicks like Dirty Harry and Death Wish. Stallone's character struggles with the standard police power structure as well as envisions himself as a sort of vigilante, both themes that have already been beaten to death and in much more interesting form.Another glaring weakness is the lack of personal depth to the Cobra character. I wanted to know how/why Cobretti become the man he is, but that subject was never even touched on. Instead, the prolonged action sequences and automatic gunfire took precedence.Thus, I cannot endorse this effort as anything that rises above Stallone's other mindless action fare. Just too many tired themes and no character development.",Cobra
51,johnnyboyz,"Cosmatos directs, comatose is his audience. Cobra: you're going to need a lot of it inside you if you're to enjoy this junk.",4,13 March 2013,"Cobra is a stupid, unsubtle celebration of brash masculinity and thumping aggression; a poorly thought through piece whose ideology reads that unremitting violence and gross levels of hostility as a means to 'get' something is a good approach. The whole thing is delivered to us through a flimsy narrative, a shocking lack of attention to whom it is depicting and this unconvincing lens of what a futuristic Los Angeles might look like. There have, of course, been films have existed in the past depicting violent people going about violent ways so as to attain something. Given examples of around the time, some have been tales of survival against outer-world odds (Predator, Aliens) whereas others were films depicting a man on a singular crusade once members of its lead's family had been placed under direct threat (Die Hard, Commando). George Cosmatos' Cobra is just stupid; a pointless excursion into the domain of futuristic violence, a film needless in its existence and running on fumes in getting stars of its time on screen kicking some serious new world order backside; a film making most of the above look like a canon of complex mediations on violence and revenge.Cobra tells the tale of a violent police officer somewhat far off into the future and his plight against a raging, psychotic motorcycle gang as he strives to protect a young woman whom they want dead. Why do they want her dead? Because she saw the profile of one of the bikers aid in the evisceration of someone one dark evening as she drove past. That's it. That's all that's required for this homicidal gang of potential New World Order inducing maniacs to unleash Hell in going all out of their way to trek across the country if needs be to find her and kill her. A person's profile, whom the authorities don't have anything on anyway, and of whom is a part of a large network of people that appear to be winning the war in getting what they want against the police, are willing to risk all their threat and anonymity to find this girl and finish her off ""because she may have seen something"". It's nonsense.The police officer lead is Sylvester Stallone's Lieutenant, named Marion Cobretti - the titular Cobra doubling up as his nickname. We're meant to believe that Cobretti is this quasi-Dirty Harry character who doesn't play by the rules in stopping criminals but stops them better than the rest of the authorities anyway. Fine, but one of his 'hardened' put-downs to a rival cop is ""You forgot to say the magic word"". If a clearer Dirty Harry inflection is needed, actor Reni Santoni plays a cop named Gonzalez in each. We are plunged into Cobra's world during the opening, an inexplicable spectacle of carnage and whatnot as a man heavy in leathered attire strolls into an innocuous supermarket in the middle of the day before proceeding to blow everyone (and everything) away. Eventually, it's revealed that this man was a part of that aforementioned apocalyptic group of Hell's Angels who want to induce their vision of what the world should look like. They have got it into their heads, then, that the way forward is to shoot up where one might purchase their groceries. Enter Cobretti, who turns up in a rickety old car from what looks like decades ago so as to emphasise his detachment from the rest of the force; the sort of thing Michael Caine's character in Children of Men drove in a film where the world too had gone to the dogs. He strides in just as purposefully and calmly as the biker did as the other cops flail outside in their methods, aware he too is about to induce some serious mess. Getting in, infiltrating the place and eliminating the threat, it's all in a day's work for one of Sly's characters.Things really kick off when a model played by Brigitte Nielsen falls afoul of the supremacist biker clan, that aforementioned witness who is of absolutely no threat and should be of no interest to the bikers at all when she happens to witness one of their boys kill someone. The woman is Ingrid Knudsen, and she is placed under Cobretti's protection as the pack hunt her down. The sad fact is that Knudsen brings nothing to the plate; her side show of an adventure wherein she is torn from her safe life as a model on the cusp of something bigger and into the firing line of bullets; bikers and bedlam is nonexistent – under a 1980s film making climate, when Sarah Connor in The Terminator was undergoing similar transgressions, this is unforgivable. Knudsen is ultimately a pretty face that needs rescuing, her role in the film an excuse to cue a bunch of action sequences; each as loud, violent and as boring as the last.It is difficult to purvey just how truly stupid Cobra is, a film derivative of both Carpenter's Halloween and Kubrick's The Shining when depicting some scenes at a hospital whereby these monsters have the jump on their victims; dull and uninspired when depicting a car chase between heroes and villains and just plain ordinary when a last stand at a roadside motel kicks off. The film is just a crass celebration of machismo and aggression; a film with no true story nor characterisation, a film without any kind of drive or heart – nor indeed with a reason to even exist. If there was a nadir in Stallone's career as he carved out this muscular, tough-guy image he had on screen – this was it.",Cobra

55,Captain_Couth,Revenge of the 80's: Sylvester Stallone's hey days!,8,26 September 2004,"Cobra (1986) was one of the many star vehicles that showcased Sly Stallone. This happens to be one of his better ones. The cheese and sleaze factor hits the roof in this one as Stallone stars as maverick cop Cobratti (his first name is pretty silly and has to be heard). A group of underground psychos are brewing and have formed a cult of killing machines. Meanwhile a model (Brigitte Nielsen) has been marked for death after escapes from one of their minions clutches. It's up to Cobratti and his cop buddy (Reni Santori) to topple this blood thirsty cult. But can they do it?I happen to enjoy this movie, it's so cheesy and sleazy and impossible not to like! Stallone mumbles and grunts his way through the film whilst Ms. Nielsen is nothing more than eye candy. Reni Santori mugs for the camera and does his best to deliver his goofy and inane dialog as the movie's designated comic relief. He also has bad timing in these movies because something always happens to him. The villains are pretty straight forward sweaty and delusional psychos who need to learn some basic manners.If you like cheesy action movies with heavy doses of sleaze, this one's a sure winner. But if you're looking for something serious or poignant, look elsewhere because you ain't going to find it here!Highly recommended!",Cobra

58,jadavix,Redundant action/thriller with no thrills and little action,4,6 July 2016,"""Cobra"" is certainly one of the lesser '80s action flicks. It doesn't have all that much action, and isn't thrilling enough to be called a thriller. It's tiresome and uneventful.Despite having two actors from the greatest action movie ever made, ""Dirty Harry"" - the Hispanic partner playing another Hispanic partner, though he does absolutely nothing but inevitably get hurt, and the legendary Andrew Robinson, who played the best villain in motion picture history in that film, but plays the typical namby pamby bleeding heart liberal cop who doesn't like the hero's ridiculous excesses in this one - ""Cobra"" is more a spiritual successor to ""Death Wish"". It depicts crime as a faceless curse made of people of every persuasion, black, white, Hispanic, male, female; even one is a policewoman. As ""Cobra"" himself says, ""you're the disease, and I'm the cure.""There is no point trying to reason with or understand the individual criminal, because they don't exist. There are no sociological causes for crime - the traditional left wing scapegoats are gone: you can't blame race because they're every colour, you can't blame gender because there are female ones too, you can't blame poverty because some are professionals. They're also all barking mad. A potential point of interest for the movie might have been showing more of the criminals' reason for being, this ""New World"" that they beguilingly hint at, and why they are often pictured in groups, banging two axes together.But no. We don't see anywhere near enough of them. It's annoying the way they are so obviously kept in the dark to service the movie's right wing agenda. The bad guys are the only thing this movie has going for it - Brian Thompson makes a great bad guy - but we barely get to see him or them. Crime has no cause: it's a ""disease"", remember?Aside from that the action scenes are negligible. There's a boring car chase and some shoot outs that have obviously had the violence toned down: we see guys fall as if shot but without any gunshot wounds to speak of.There is also no sex or nudity; it's so sanitized it's like a Chuck Norris movie without martial arts.Stallone also looks as small in this one as I can remember seeing him. I wonder if he laid off the roids around this time.",Cobra

Essentially a Dirty Harry for the 80s, it features the standard ""The law isn't always justice"" cop who shows his milquetoast superiors how it's done. Stallone awkwardly tries to graft a sarcastic edge to his match chewing, sunglasses wearing monosyllabic avatar, but the quips fall flatter than a 14th century globe. Paired with wife Brigitte Nielsen--who's not exactly Meryl Streep, but better than you'd think--he scowls and shoots his way to the final showdown with the main villain, played with an unnerving intensity by Brian Thompson (you may not know the name, but you know the face).

63,lukem-52760,Best Film Of Stallone's Career!!! An 80's Masterpiece,10,10 September 2021,"Easily my favourite Stallone movie.I grew up on Stallone as i did Schwarzenegger, Seagal, Van Damme & many more & each have their own Classic films & Cobra is definitely Stallone's!!!Stallone here looks like a George Michael album cover but i love it lol yep there's 80's cheese here but i love it.Stallone's Cobra is a tough-as-hell vigilante cop in the mould of Eastwood's Classic Dirty Harry but actually more violent & it's Stallone's best character in my opinion.If you put Eastwood's The Enforcer, Halloween 2 & Death Wish 3 in a blender, Cobra would come out!!!What stands out about this dark action Thriller is the very creepy atmosphere that feels like a Horror or a Slasher flick & has many elements of those genre's too. It's a mix that just works perfectly for an 80's Action flick, we have the vigilante no-nonsense Bad-Ass cop who lives by his own rules & does what the bullshi# ""Justice System"" won't do!!! I love that about this movie that it's an Angry film about how the Justice system does not work & only protects the evil scum & the victims suffer & it's so TRUE!!!Cobra is a product of it's time but it's truth is timeless.The System does protect the evil out there so its nice to see someone fighting back. Cobra is a movie that fits in the same Vigilante genre as Bronson's Death Wish films & Eastwood's Dirty Harry films in a way. Here Cobra is on the trail of a sicko sadistic gang of psycho serial killers that call themselves the New World Order & they're a savage bunch too. Cobra is on the dark streets of a Los Angeles that looks & feels so dirty, dark & dangerous. The look & cinematography is excellent as is the music throughout with it's pure 80's goodness. All elements are 80's at it's best for what an action cop thriller should be.Cobra should've been the start of a franchise for the character but hey I'm just glad we have this one Classic.Stallone is ultra Cool as Cobra & ultra deadly too & really hates the corrupted rules & regulations of his job so he does it his way. Also his sweet tooth partner is good & fun in this flick.The murders are fairly brutal & the mood of darkness & danger hangs over the movie but when it gets down & Dirty with the Action it is Fantastic!!! Such as the motel seige sequence near the end with all the bikers & gunmen after Cobra & the beautiful witness (Bridget Neilson) & what an ending fight sequence with Stallone & the Cult leader Brian Thompson (Fright Night part 2) who by the way makes a very scary & cold-blooded savage killer here know as the ""Night Slasher"" this guy is hulking huge & looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger & is one scary & sweaty muscled bad guy.Cobra is a stunning action slasher Thriller that gets better with each Nostalgic viewing.",Cobra

It has several very interesting features, and it shows much of what was very cool in the '80s thrillers.Cobra is Stallone's coolest movie, and coolest role; it's relevant that the movie was written by himself (and it's a poorly made script). Cosmatos directed. And yet, it's quite singular in Stallone's career, he did not shoot another thriller like this one (--while it might of been a pretty franchiseinstead of any Stallone's franchises ).It's a thriller, a suspenseful, exciting crime flick; I liked the score (FEEL THE HEAT, sung by Jean Beauvoir; Gladys Knight and Medley; Miami Sound Machine; John Cafferty; Robert Tepper; Gary Wright.

The plot is ridiculous even by the weak standards of this genre. A gang of axe-wielding psychos are taking out those they view as ""weak"" in pursuit of a New World Order. Man, you couldn't wake up any morning in the 1980s without hearing about some new gang of serial killers busting out.At least Lt. Cobretti is on the job. Better known as ""Cobra"" or ""the Cobra,"" he carries a special pistol with a cobra head illustration on the handle stock, not to mention an attitude, ""just a little one,"" as he himself admits. Machine guns, grenades, all are found in his tool box, but he keeps a matchstick in his mouth instead of a cigarette, so kids won't get bad ideas.The killer gang doesn't seem all that subtle, attacking one waitress inside her car on a city street. Yet they carefully guard their privacy to the point that when their facially-deformed leader is glancingly spotted in the act by a model played by Brigitte Nielsen, he pulls out all the stops to kill her. Sending his minions out to get whacked by the Cobra, the psycho sneaks into a hospital where she is being looked after. We get shades of ""Halloween II"" as she runs for her life through deserted corridors. You'd think he'd give up, especially as he risks being spotted by others trying to kill this one witness, but no, this guy continues after her through the movie, Ahab in a stocking mask.Yes, indeed, ""Cobra"" is one stupid film. It's also unpleasant in its stale echoes of reactionary politics, punchy in its attempts at humor, and threadbare in terms of character and motivation. One police supervisor played by Andy Robinson (one of two actors from the cast of ""Dirty Harry,"" Cobra sidekick Reni Santori being the other) whines about Cobra's strong arm tactics, which Cobretti effectively counters by physically assaulting him - twice.What's good here? The lighting is very effective, giving the film a glitzy sheen very in tune with the time. Though his acting is stiff, Stallone never looked better, which may be why he does so little with his character  too busy vogueing. The cars and equipment are cool to look at, and there are some terrific stunts.But the stunts are done in service of action scenes that don't work. Cobra fights off human-wave style attacks by dozens of motorcyclists who seem to be competing for the best wipe-out. The big shootout at the end is unbelievably protracted, with Cobra hitting everything he aims at with a snub machine gun while not one of the dozens of shootists firing at him manage much of anything.""This whole sorry ordeal is some damn sick joke if you ask me,"" Robinson's police supervisor complains. Actually, ""Cobra"" isn't played as a joke at all, but very straight, a big part of the problem. One useful aspect of ""Cobra"" is it gives the lie to the phrase ""mindless entertainment."" In order to be entertaining, a mind has to be working somewhere. When one isn't, the result is this.",Cobra

His total disregard for the law he supposedly enforces, and his vengeful attitude towards the scum he despises means that any psycho who crosses ""Cobra"" is in for a nasty time.George P.

It's hard to find any redeeming features in an action film with nothing to look at and a thriller with absolutely no tension.""Cobra"" easily joins Arnie's ""Commando"" as one of the worst ever main stream ""shoot 'em ups"". I figure Stallone and co-star Dolph Lundgren (Sly's Russian nemesis Ivan Drago in ""Rocky IV"") thought they'd better film this woeful flick in order to make that third ""Rocky"" sequel look good (it was the weakest of the five films).As a matter of fact Cosmatos' movie is so close to B-grade/camp humour that all he needed to do was give it a nudge in that direction and ""Cobra"" would have been a classic of the genre.

DOP Ric Waite's images exist in some sort of surreal world that the film can't possibly contextualize. At magic hour, a bad guy on a motorcycle is intercut with ludicrous but gorgeous images of other bad guys (in suits, no less) ritualistically banging axe handles together in some underground warehouse in Los Angeles in time with a dark, brooding synth score The sequence that follows, a madman's bullet-ridden assault on a supermarket, is again stunningly shot and staged and a triumph of style over anything you want to name.Once these bravura sequences have passed, mediocrity and Hollywood Plotting 101 cuts in and we're pulled back into a dull reality.But don't fret. Sit tight for long enough and you get an enthusiastically staged car chase with ducks, machine guns, classic cars bursting from buildings, a Santa who comes close to being roadkill and badly uttered Stallone lines.Fast forward then to the film's climactic shootout on motorcycles and you're left with an action film that spends forty minutes doing everything right.Stallone emotes with cruise control and his wife-at-the-time Brigitte Nielson just wears the clothes and moves from first position to second.",Cobra
70,dworldeater,Cobra rules!!!,10,5 May 2016,"The winning team of writer/actor Sly Stallone and director George P Cosmatos collaborate for a second time after making the 80's action classic Rambo- First Blood pt.2. Cobra has been a long time favorite of mine that holds up well through the years and multiple viewings. Cobra borrows a lot from Don Siegel/Clint Eastwood classic Dirty Harry, but amp up the action 80's style ala Rambo and Commando. Add dark ambiance and one liners that were common in Commando and you get Cobra. Sly is Marion Cobretti, a super cop and submachine gun wielding one man army. He is part of the ""Zombie Squad and is an asset that is utilized when the LAPD need extra stopping power on the bad guys. He becomes involved on a case where he must protect a witness against a secret society of psychopaths led by The Night Slasher(Brian Thompson). Brian Thompson nearly steals the show with his amazing performance as a stone cold psychopath. His performance was dark, brooding and totally intense. The Night Slasher is one of my favorite screen villains and Brian Thompson's performance is second to none. Even with an all out roid rage, our hero Cobra has his hands full. Sly's wife at the time Brigitte Nielson gives one of her better performances as damsel in distress and also was some great eye candy as well. Reni Santoni and Andrew Robinson of Dirty Harry fame did well in their support roles. The film looks great and is packed with tons of action. Cobra still rules and is one of the most entertaining action films to come out of Hollywood in the good ole' days of the 1980's.",Cobra
71,Witchfinder-General-666,"""You're A Disease. And I'm The Cure.""",5,19 August 2009,"""Cobra"" of 1986 must be one of the most deliciously silly and clichéd action films of the 80s, and that's quite an accomplishment regarding the countless trashy gems this wondrous cinematic decade has brought forth. I will never claim that this is a good or even decent film, yet it is undeniable that it is incredibly entertaining. And, after all, isn't that what counts most? George P. Cosmatos' film, to which star Silvester Stallone wrote the screenplay himself, shamelessly rips off the ""Dirty Harry"" series as well as a variety of other superior action flicks, but in a delightfully exaggerated manner. Everything in this film is stereotypical to a point that is impossible not to enjoy.Stallone stars as super tough cop Lieutenant Marion ""Cobra"" Cobretti - a massively exaggerated Dirty Harry-style ruffian with more muscles and less wit. Constantly criticized by superiors and the media for his violent manner of crime-fighting, Cobra wears Ray Ban sunglasses, biker gear and always has a match in the corner of his mouth. The guy talks mainly in silly but entertaining one-liners (such as the title of this review). He even has a cobra embroidered on the grip of his gun. LA is being terrorized by a group of psychos called ""The Order"" lead by an exaggerated muscle-villain called 'Night Ripper' (played by Brian Thompson, who is basically Stallone's evil twin). Followers of the Order kill people in order to establish a 'New World' (for whatever reason). When hot Model Ingrid (Brigitte Nielsen) becomes witness of one of their crimes, her life is in danger. Luckily for her, Cobra is assigned to the case...The storyline may be among the most predictable and stereotypical things ever written, but it doesn't get boring for a second. The film is filled with action and violence, apart from a lot of shooting, there's stabbing, hacking, burning, etc. The role of Cobra suits Stallone extremely well. Young Brigitte Nielsen is very sexy in the female lead, though, for whatever reason, she sadly keeps her clothes on (not that boobs are mandatory in every movie, but it's definitely nice to see them in films like this one). As stated above, the film shamelessly rips of the Dirty Harry series. The cast even includes two major cast members of Don Siegel's original 1971 masterpiece ""Dirty Harry"": Andrew Robinson, who was played the psychotic Scorpio Killer in ""Dirty Harry"", plays the arrogant a**hole colleague who doesn't approve of Cobra's violent methods; Reni Santorini, who played Dirty Harry's partner named Gonzales, plays Cobra's partner named Gonzales (!) here. The action scenes are very well done, and the violence is bloody and brutal. ""Cobra"" isn't one of the best films Stallone has ever been part of, but it's definitely one of the most entertaining ones. The film, which runs less than 90 minutes, has quite an enormous body-count, lots of ultra-violent action and a super-cool Stallone and promises pure entertainment. Pure, silly, action-packed fun, and highly recommendable as exactly that.",Cobra
72,masonsaul,Enjoyable action thriller,5,10 July 2020,"Cobra is a mixed bag but ultimately an enjoyable action thriller.

It's reasonably well paced and well filmed with enjoyable action sequences. Both the soundtrack and the music by Sylvester Levay are good.",Cobra
73,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,An Underrated Classic,10,15 December 2011,"What is it that makes police thrillers so interesting to watch? Some comical dialog, high-strung action sequences and a menacing looking killer. Cobra has all of these elements in this movie and it works really well. Cobra is based off a book called Fair Game by Paula Gosling. Sylvester Stallone has ramped up the action and added some extras into it. Stallone plays Marion Cobretti (or Cobra as he's called) who is one of the best cops on the force but is only used for the major emergencies. What's funny is that many times, when there is trouble he's called in - so why bother saving him as a last resort if he's needed all the time anyway? Oh well. You can't have your cake and eat it too.Starring with Stallone is Reni Santoni who plays his partner Gonzales. Usually when the camera is focused on them together, this is where most of the funny scenes come from. There are other funny parts but this is the main source. For some reason, Gonzales loves to eat all unhealthy food and Cobra is always trying to persuade him to eat healthier. It is cheesy but it delivers the chuckles. In a movie where everything is tense, there's got to be a little light- heartedness. These kinds of things are included so that the viewer knows that the main characters know what they're doing. This movie was panned by many critics saying that the dialog was very boring and the acting was terrible; sorry but I didn't see that. I had some good laughs and I think Stallone's character was written to be the way it was in the film, nothing more.Action sequences - what makes them good in this film? Basically how they're executed. Because much of the story is a chase, it will keep the viewer on their seat. Some action sequences are so unique in this movie, I could bet that you won't find another film before its time doing such a stunt. I'm sure this is what got this movie to earn so much money. With a budget of 25 million, they earned back almost twice as much. That's pretty good for its time.The actor who plays the killer (or Night Slasher) is Brian Thompson who I'll admit is pretty scary looking. He grunts, snorts, and has a bellowing voice that would make you cower in fear if you were the person who was going to be murdered by this dude. Seriously, in one scene he wears a wife beater where his muscles are enormous. In an arm wrestle alone, I don't think Stallone would stand a chance. Someone like Arnold Schwarzenegger probably would be better for the job. But this is a Stallone movie so you work with what you get and either way it's a great film.Stallone's version of Gosling's book, Fair Game is action packed and quite thrilling. Adding to the action in this film, director George P. Cosmatos has a great cast that makes the characters very likable.",Cobra
74,PredragReviews,You have the right to remain silent!,7,6 April 2017,"I had almost forgotten what a great simple thriller this was. Simple plot, maverick cop Marion Cobretti (Stallone) is assigned to protect a beautiful female witness from a cult of Neo-Nazi style supremacist bikers who are terrorising Los Angeles with a spate of brutal murders - You get it all here; a scene reminiscent of Halloween 2, where the cult leader (a monster of a man known as The Night Slasher) goes on a Michael Myers style killing spree at the City's hospital, plenty of bloody shootouts and fights and a couple of superb Car & Bike chases that are second only to the Mad Max movies, in terms of violence and spectacle. Really, really good stunt work and special effects! Also, there's lots of firearms, including Cobretti's hi-tech, laser sighted Jatimatic sub-machine gun, well deployed throughout the many chases and firefights!The tension throughout the film is well sustained and it is superbly atmospheric, creepy at times, but always entertaining and gripping one way or another. Brigitte Nielsen is also terrific as the model witness who they are forced to protect and she is convincingly terrified a lot of the time. Brian Thompson plays the killer in no doubt one of his first roles, and he of course later went on to play the bounty hunter in The X Files. The direction is top notch, and it was a shrewd idea, possibly by Stallone to bring in George P Cosmatos who Stallone had previously worked with on Rambo 2.

Sylvester Stallone is Marion Cobretti a.k.a Cobra who drives a custom 1950 Mercury. It's a story which has little interest in the villainous characters and centres on action and stylisation. There are similarities to the later films in the Dirty Harry series, especially the nihilistic tone, but ""Cobra"" goes further in its hyperviolence and bodycount. It has a gritty feel and a high intensity for graphic violence, showing the dark side of a Darwinist radicalism, and works as much as a horror than thriller. It is effective in creating a marked difference between good and evil as a theme but it is a gratuitously violent film with simplistic action tropes and plotting. The main character is an empty vessel. Attempts to temper this with a love interest fail. It's a film intending to show a violent, disintegrating society, but it aims high at making violence entertaining.",Cobra

81,baumer,You're the disease and I'm the cure.,8,26 July 1999,"Cobra is one of the most cardboard characters I have ever seen. I know I don't have a monopoly on that opinion but what I do think about the movie is not the general consensus. I actually love this movie. I love all the cheeseball scenes of violence. I love the macho lines. I love the supporting characters. I think we can all agree that Cobra wasn't going for the Oscars here. But what it does is entertains you for 90 minutes, and the script is so fresh with one liners that you can't wait for the next one to pop up. One of my favourites is when Ingrid? says to Cobra "" What's wrong? You look so mad. "" and he replies, "" I always get this way before breakfast."" If these are the kind of lines that you can stomach and not really care about seeing the next Gandhi or Out Of Africa, then this is the film for you. George P. Cosmatos has directed some excellent pictures with Rambo and Tombstone, Cobra is about as fun as those ones. Sure the plot is lacking and we never really find out what the New World was supposed to be or what it was supposed to accomplish, but it is the execution that makes this film the hoot that it is. And did I mention the script? Because it really is funny, and it makes Stallone's Cobra look to be the toughest man alive. There is a review in here ( I think it is the one below mine ) where the person who wrote it was talking about things that I have never heard of. His review may as well been a foreign language. All I know is that he ultimately didn't like Cobra, that much I can understand. But if what you are doing is going into this film and comparing it to Shakespeare or Dionyses or Thropolese or whatever it is that he or she said in the review then my recommendation is to curl up with a really good Jane Austen hook and have a brandy by a warm fire. That is what your speed is, and I guess there is nothing wrong with that. But if you want to be mindlessly entertained for 90 minutes, rent Cobra. It action packed, the characters are clichéd so that you can laugh at them and the script is funny. Don't look for Cobra to be something that it was never meant to be. It's not going to teach you anything valuable about life. It's just good, fun entertainment. That's it.",Cobra
82,blott2319-1,"Nonsense, but perhaps a bit of unintentional fun",4,4 February 2021,"Back in the 1980s there were so many movies that asked you to turn off your brain for some over-the-top action with a tough-as-nails police officer who doesn't play by the rules. Cobra is just one more in that long line of films. Stallone gives his typical wooden performance of the infallible hero, and he only brings the occasional smile when telling other people what to eat. That is a strange runner throughout the film that I guess might have been intended as a joke, but it doesn't really work (particularly considering the advice is coming from a guy who eats scissor-cut pieces of pizza while he works.) The action sequences have moments of fun, even if the strategies used by police in these fights are complete nonsense. At times I wish the entire movie just took place in a post-apocalyptic wasteland where there were no police. At least then I could justify how a cop could get away with these irresponsible and highly dangerous tactics. But I don't think we're supposed to think too much about any of the logic in the film. If you're in the mood for a bombastic shoot-em-up and not much of a plot, then Cobra could work for you. I found it largely dumb, but occasionally it was dumb in a fun way, so it's hard to complain too much. Finally, there's one scene that is easily one of the strangest and most hilarious editing decisions I've ever seen. As a song plays they flash between the cops doing their job and Brigitte Nielsen modeling with a bunch of giant toy robots for no comprehensible reason. The journey from confusion to hysterical laughter that sequence took me through might have been worth watching Cobra all on its own.",Cobra

I freakin love the movie Cobra. I saw this in theaters when I was 12. I thought this movie was the greatest movie ever made until I saw Commando. Now twenty years later Cobra is making history as the greatest guilty pleasure of all time. Where do I even start with this one? Well for one the Reagan era right wing message make this one fascinating. Indeed Stallone says so few words and like his turn in First Blood goes into a rant with head bad guy Brian Thompson over how the system works. The action sequences are very well staged however and the scene where Brigette Neilsen is attacked by the slasher even inspired Child's Play's scene where Chucky stabs through the wall while a blonde woman screams. Cobra's beginning sets the tone where Stallone tells a bad guy to blow up the store because ""Go ahead, I don't shop here!"" only minutes later to tell a liberal reporter to tell excessive force to the dead guy.

Sylvester Stallone plays a cop named ""Marion Cobretti"". Get it... Cobretti: Cobra. Get it? The Hound is certainly not Italian, but he strongly doubts there are too many people back in the old country with the last name ""Cobretti"".Anyway, Stallone is a cop on the trail of a serial killer known as the ""Night Slasher"". Keep in mind that the bulk of the film takes place in L.A. where about the same time there was a real serial killer known as the ""Night Stalker"". See where we're going? Our killer in the film, as Stallone keeps trying to tell his superiors, does not act alone. He in fact has an entire army of like-minded henchmen who are out to kill people they have deemed as simply ""weak"". The Night Slasher is played by a big and ugly actor named Brian Thompson. I went to high school with a guy named Brian Thompson. He was a geek. I think he's a plumber in Omaha now, but I digress...Stallone gets assigned to protect a woman (Nielsen) who witnessed one of the group's killings. By the end of the film he has taken her all the way out of the city to hopefully avoid the army of killers, but all this does is set up a ""one man against an entire army"" scenario that was so prevalent in 1980s action films. The film is packed with stunts and shoot-outs and some of them are actually quite good. The film lacks skillful plot construction and any decent dialog, however. It's basically a mindless film designed to excite young boys about 14 years of age which I was when I first saw it. I loved it then, but now I've moved on to appreciating much more intelligent cinema. Here are some interesting notes:1. The film has two major players from Dirty Harry. Andrew Robinson (Scorpio) and Reni Santoni (Gonzales). That doesn't by any means make this a good cop film, though. 2. The film is supposedly based on a novel called ""Fair Game"" which was also the basis for the terrible 1995 film of the same title in which we are lucky enough to catch a glimpse of Cindy Crawford's breasts. At least I think they were hers. Maybe it was a double. 3. In one scene, Stallone uses a pair of scissors to cut a piece of cold pizza in half before consuming it while at the same time cleaning his handgun. 4. There is a really hot nurse in a nighttime scene at a hospital. 5. And yes... the mother of all trivia associated with this film: The Night Slasher's main henchman is played by a man named John Herzfeld. His biggest claim to fame is that he directed that awful 1983 film called ""Two of a Kind"" staring John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John.

88,ivo-cobra8,Stallone's 80's best underrated Action Horror film Cobra!,10,6 October 2015,"My favorite best Stallone action movie. But from the 80's that Stallone made action films is the first stand alone film not meaning Rocky and Rambo. Cobra will never stop been my favorite best action movie horror thriller from the 80's that is out there. It is one of my personal favorite movies. I wish only the movie wouldn't be that short but still it was directed by George P. Cosmatos who directed Rambo this movie was made right after Rambo: First Blood Part II was released. Cobra is also a Cannon film and one of the best action horror thrillers that is out there. Cobra simply rocks! And it is a highly entertaining underrated action flick that guarantees the viewer a great show. Cobra is another one of those movies. It's not deep, it has a social message but doesn't really care about it. Its just pure old fun. The night slasher kills people randomly. He targets anyone, anywhere. The police don't have a clue, they can't stop him, all they can do is wait for the next death. But that all changes when Ingrid gets a good clear look at the chief of the gang. Yes, it's not one person, it's a group of killers that have set their minds on hunting the weak of society. Now they'll do anything to kill the only witness, the woman that can finish their 'dream' but they didn't count on one man: Marion Cobretti. The movie plays with the idea that murderers use the system to get away with their crimes. It explores the fear in society, the impotence of the courts and introduces Cobretti, a cop who doesn't care about the law only his justice. Although I don't agree with this I still enjoyed the movie since Stallone didn't spend much time making his point, rather went fast for the action.YOU'RE THE DISEASE, AND I'M THE CURE!!!!!!!! Cobra is a 1986 American action film directed by George P. Cosmatos, and written by Sylvester Stallone, who also starred in the title role. The film co-stars Reni Santoni, Brigitte Nielsen and Andrew Robinson. The film received negative reviews, with much criticism focused on the overuse of genre tropes, yet it debuted at the number one spot on the U.S. box office and became a financial success.The film was loosely based on the novel Fair Game by Paula Gosling, which was later filmed under that title in 1995. However, Stallone's screenplay was originally conceived from ideas he had during pre-production of Beverly Hills Cop, whose screenplay he heavily revised. He had wanted to make Beverly Hills Cop a less comedic and more action-oriented film, which the studio rejected as being far too expensive. When he left that project, Eddie Murphy was brought in to play the lead roleA tough-on-crime street cop must protect the only surviving witness to a strange murderous cult with far reaching plans. The cult and their leader The Night Slasher are killing people all over the town in Los Angeles for believing in their New World so that will the strongest people survived but their is one tough cop that stands in their way and he must protect a surviving witness that cab identify the Slasher. I seriously love this film from the 80'a and I wish there would be more films like this. The Action sequences, the explosion, death scenes are fantastic after Rambo here comes Cobra.Is one of my best Stallone Action movies beside Tango & Cash (1989), Rambo, Rocky, Cliffhanger, Demolition Man and The Specialist it is one of my favorite action movies of all time! 10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval",Cobra

So much for hype.Stallone's screenplay sees him cast as a tough guy with overlarge sunglasses, a matchstick fetish and a girl's name. Turns out he's really called Marion Cobretti (in a possible John Wayne reference) and that Cobra is just a rather silly macho handle. ""You're a disease... and I'm the cure"" sounded like a cold, terrifying line on paper. On screen it's just a glib catchphrase, trotted out by a through-the-motions Sly who desperately wants his own ""I'll be back."" Boringly, Cobra is a no-nonsense cop who bucks the system - the sort of character who only Stallone thinks is original.Some unusual casting vaguely stirs interest. Sledge Hammer, Garak from DS9 and the bounty hunter from The X-Files all share screentime with Stallone's wooden ex-wife Brigette. However, the most notable thing is the blatant product placement for Cools' and Pepsi.It's weird what relics 80s action movies are nowadays. Apart from all the fashions, we get the dialogue-saving montage set to an MOR rock track. (Robert Topper's Angel of the City containing the classy lyrics ""Working their fingers to the bone, trying to get blood from a stone"") And gratuituous car chases are very tedious things indeed.Even aged fourteen I could understand ambiguity and hoped for some, though it seems aged thirty-nine Stallone couldn't even comprehend such a concept. Any sense of ethical debate is as sophisticated as that in a Michael Winner film. Criminals are mindless, psychotic animals, there to be wiped out. Any objection is met by Cobra displaying a boy's corpse with ""You tell that to his family, huh?"" These guys even park in disabled parking spaces, should their moral convictions be in any doubt. The following exchange between Neilson and Sly spells out his right-wing, singular view on things: ""There's all these crazy people everywhere... why can't the police just put them away and keep them away?"" ""You've gotta tell that to the judge.""As far as dire Stallone movies go, then this one doesn't sink to the depths of, say, Judge Dredd or The Specialist. But in many ways its worse because it doesn't really feel like a film at all, more a half-baked series of action set-pieces crammed noisily together. I did smile at the end credit which advised: ""Patrons are warned not to attempt or imitate any of the stunts or situations portrayed in this film."" And, on the subject of decent bits, I liked the infra-red gun on the grenade, which was a rare example of (very minor) ingenuity. On every other level though, this movie is generic, derivative, moronic, turgid and dull.",Cobra
90,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Ridiculously 80s,5,26 March 2005,"This is one of those non-sensible 80s movies that require you don't think at all while watching. By today's standards this is more of a slapstick joke than an action film. Laden with violence and action... and sloppy 80s editing makes this one a real mixed bag. If you liked films like 'Commando' you'll get a kick out of this as it is pretty much the same over-done nonsense.Stallone stars as Marion Cobretti, aka Cobra. Complete with a cool car and personalized custom weapons which include a laser-aimed submachine gun and a Colt with picture of a cobra on it. And did I mention that his name is Marion (yes, Marion). But, don't let that get you down, Cobra is a pretty macho guy who is good at doing what tough-guys do best: kick ass. His nemesis is a vicious serial killer called the Nightstalker and his gang of goons which go around killing women and, of course, any witnesses. After one woman gets away after witnessing a brutal murder, Cobra is assigned to protect her. Action and carnage ensue.The film is pretty much filled to the brim with action scenes and seeing that Stallone wrote this script for himself it is not a surprise. The highlight of all the fireworks would have to be the insane car-chase which takes us through back alleys, the highway, lawns, jumping over foot bridges and from multi-story parking lots, and, finally ending with a heap of twisted metal. The final action scene is even more over the top with an outrageously high body-count which does in fact echo Arnie's big shoot-out in 'Commando,' which came out only the year before. I guess Stallone was trying to catch up on on-screen body count. I wasn't counting, but I'd say he did. 5/10Rated R: strong violence, and profanity",Cobra

In my opinion, this movie leaves a lot to be desired, I think this movie has some script problems, I thought this is one of those movies where ""Good Guy"" always escapes from ""Bad Guy"", also I thought it had too much action and little history. But besides, I really liked the movie, and I recommend it to a lot of people, I think the special effects were fantastic, the actors were very good, the story was captivating and the villain had a good motivation.

92,Maziun,"Classic cult so bad it's good"" action movie from the 80's",6,11 August 2013,"""Cobra"" is pretty much Stallone's tribute to the quintessential maverick detective thriller ""Dirty Harry"". Stallone even went as far as casting Andrew Robinson and Reni Santori in his movie , both of which starred in ""Dirty Harry"". The film tries to say something about the inadequacies of the American legal system and that's the main reason why it was criticized by many people.It promotes vigilantism and breaking the rules, if it's necessary to destroy the evil. It also reminds that there is some kind of evil that can't be negotiated or reasoned with and that sometimes the violence is the only answer. The justice system is failing, letting monsters re-enter society causing a risk to the innocents. I agree with what the movie says and I'm not ashamed of it. It's not a movie for people obsessed with political correctness. I can understand people who hate ""Cobra"". You're either going to love or hate this movie.It is extremely stupid , cheesy and violent action movie. There's not really much plot here, the characters are less than one dimensional , the dialogues are sometimes flat and it all falls apart when you think about it for a second. It's so bad it's fascinating. That's why I love this movie. This is an very entertaining movie if you don't take it seriously. This is one of the best cheesiest action classics out there. It's a corpse littered escapism . It has a message , but it's mostly pure old school fun. It's a movie where the good guy never gets hit and the villains get what they deserve. A silly, campy, unrealistic and illogical but an entertaining fun action film. They simply don't make 'em like this any more... Cobretti (Watch the movie to hear his real name !) is one of the coolest characters in movie history. He wears long overcoat, sunglasses, chews on a match-stick with a Cobra embossed handgun down the front of his tight jeans. He drives custom 1950 Mercury , cuts his pizza with scissors, puts his newspaper on the barbecue and has a witticism for almost every occasion. His one liners are certainly memorable : ""You're the disease , I'm the cure"" , ""I don't shop here"" , ""You got a life preserver?... Cause your fries are drowning."" , ""This is where the law stops, and I start... sucker"". Cobretti is invincible and arrogant , but he does have heart and sense of humor. Stallone has been unfairly criticized by his performance . He mumbles his lines with barely any emotion , but that's the whole point of his macho cop. He plays his character the way he should play Judge Dredd – as a tough , barely emotional bastard.The screenplay was written by Stallone himself and is loosely based on a novel ""Fair Game"" by Paula Gosling. He just took the basic premise of a cop protecting a woman and going on the run with her. Stallone was also obviously inspired by the ""Night Stalker"" killings of the previous year (1985), so he gives his villain the similar moniker of the ""Night Slasher"". Stallone also used a lot of ideas in ""Cobra"" he developed for ""Beverly Hills cop"". ""Cobra"" is an action extravaganza full of violence. Director George P. Cosmatos keeps the movie at quite fast pace with some exciting action scenes . The car chase is one of the finest chases in history of cinema. Cosmatos also manages to successfully add a touch of slasher/horror into action genre. The photography by Ric Waite is excellent. It has a wonderfully moody/Gothic atmosphere at times . The editing is tight thanks to Don Zimmerman . The score by Sylvester Levay is good. There are some great songs here : John Cafferty and The Beaver band ""Voice of America's sons"" , Jean Brauvoir ""Feel the heat"" , Robert Tepper ""Angel of the city"" and Miami sound machine ""Suave"". Brian Thompson is quite scary and Lee Garlington quite creepy as the villains. Brigitte Nielsen is just bad and she has no chemistry with Sly (it's hard to believe that they were a couple in real life).""Cobra"" is one of the iconic images of the glorious 80's American pop culture. It's a perfectly agreeable time-waster. A fast food for the mind. Too bad they never made a sequel. It was reasonably successful at the Box Office . I've seen a lot , lot worse movies. This is a bad movie , kitsch , but a very likable one. I give it 7/10 , but deep down in my heart it's 10/10.",Cobra

A car with all the turbo and nitro gadgets you can imagine, but that can't get pass an old Chevy or whatever the model. He knows they're coming, but he just sits on the bed and wait for them to arrive. So many clichés. There's nothing in this movie we haven't seen before in better films. 10 bad guys get killed before Stallone's partner gets hit (do you really think he's dead?), 26 before he's got to drive through some burning cars forming a barricade, 37 before finally having to deal one on one with the villain. And oh! the classic scene at the end. You know, an old industrial plant, a foundry in this case. The director's brain must have been going at least 3 miles per hour! I was sure the villain was going to end up in a bucket of acid. But I must admit I was slightly wrong on that prediction. Thanks Cobra for a job well done!

Cobretti(Cobra/Stallone) is a renegade cop that they call in to do the ""dirty"" work, not unlike the Dirty Harry films of old. Stallone is a nice fit for this loner character.The opening of the film is, much like the entire first hour, a pretty good thriller with some horror elements. Cobretti and his partner have good chemistry, and Bridget Nielson surprisingly isn't all that bad here either.The film has a little style and the car is sweet. There are many moments with genuine scares, but the film loses steam down the stretch. It just seems as if patience and funding fell short. There are some really ridiculous scenario's and plot-turns late, and the whole ""gang"" theme is poorly developed and a bit over the top. It truly ends with a thud.This is a trip down nostalgia lane.

95,RonellSowes,Bad movies are a disease and this ain't the cure,4,12 December 2020,"It's pretty clear that Cobra is supposed to be a Dirty Harryesque film. A rough cop who rebels against the system and fights a psychopathic serial killer.The movie even includes two actors from Dirty Harry in minor roles,Andy Robinson and Reni Santoni who also played The Scorpio Killer and Callahan's partner respectively. But this film is a far cry from the 1971 cop classic and struggles to gain any entertainment value.
Sylvester Stallone starred in the titular role and he adapted the script from a novel. Stallone wrote many of the films he starred in perhaps because he recieved a well deserved Oscar for Rocky but other than that one, everything written by Sly is pretty mediocre to say the least. Although the catchphrase for the film is pretty cool.Cobra doesn't lack any amount action but it fails completely in creating any action of substance.

There really is no need to speak about plot, as this movie makes as much sense as, well, blind watching a TV. There's nothing in the film that could be describer as logic or sense in the story; it just happens and you are amazed of the lack of intelligence.If you can name a cliché, the changes are that Cobra has it. There's bad blood between cops, traitors and nonsense murderers. There even is silly sidekick, and ""clever"" throws. And it all is crowned with a classic 80's soundtrack of the hottest bands of the hour. And yet I couldn't care less.The bottom line is, Cobra is garbage. Idiotic piece of trash action directed in the midst of the 80's. A movie that would have been better left undone.Score: 2/10. The film is just too illogical and the actors do very bad job, but really, no one could lift the script into any level of adequacy.Camp value: 7/10.

98,PeterMitchell-506-564364,Not bad Sly actioner,6,22 November 2012,"The cover for this movie is awesome, totally inviting, in a movie that delivers big on action, but lesser thrills that are still sufficient. We have loner cop, Stallone who rids criminals with more disregard than Dirty Harry. He doesn't care what he has to do to get the job done. He's part of the zombie squad who deal with the worst offenders out there. At the moment he's dealing with a real bunch of crazies, the most frightening I have seen on film, the worst there are, determined on taking out all of society so they can build their perfect world, one member a cop, who could of been revealed later in the flick I thought. Stallone, I don't believe, is the worst actor in the world. He runs rings around Arnie, Van Damne, Norris, and especially Seagal who's always the same in every film. Here Sly, plays a character who works to his own rules, doesn't talk much, and doesn't like crowds. He could be the father of Dirty Harry. He's the guy who's gonna take down this scum. A witness to the latest killing, model Bridgette Nielsen, who became Sly's other half, is taken into protective custody. The crazies make several attempts on her life, one that culminates in a spectacular car chase, in Stallone's 50's Mercury Montery, worth the watch alone. Stallone with his added gadgets to this eye catching piece of transport, can really make this mother go. I loved how he spun a one eighty, and with one hand, unleashed a hail of bullets into an assailing vehicle with a AK 47 I think. There's no denying this is a cool and fresh action movie, and Stallone knows how to bring in the big bucks at the flicks with his Rambo and Rocky escapades. This just sadly wasn't as popular, running for a few weeks. This is my favorite sly film, and he looks great with a toothpick and dark shades that suit his character perfectly, but again this flick falls into that category of mind numbing violence, over brain matter. A film built more on image and style that I like. There isn't that much nasty gore displayed. When compared to the last Rambo film, it shows us how far we have come in the violent stakes. Brian Thompson, the leader of the psychotics, makes a repulsive villain, just what the character calls for. It's great to see him and Sly square off at the end, with Sly delivering a line of finality with cold hatred in his eyes, and a remorse that never existed towards this hated enemy. Weirdly enough, Stallone's cop foe here, Monty (a fine Andrew Robinson) played the psychotic in the first Dirty Harry, delivering a magnetic performance we could never forget of a villain we loved to hate. He's toned a lot since then. He went on star in Hellraiser. I loved how Sly punched him out after his apology. Also Sly's quizzical look off of Nielsen as she drowns her fries in ketchup. At least she eats more healthy than Sly's Partner, Gonzalez (Reni Santori) who's daily diet consists of chocolate, lollies, and cake. The film's opening sequence is one of the best of it's genre, opening on a big striking tattooed Cobra, of course, followed by a V.O regarding factual homicide statistics from from Sly's character, get this (Marion Cobretti) before we're soon introduced to the first psycho who goes rampant in a supermarket. What a great place to start a flick. Actually inspired from a novel, this film, called ""Fair Game"". Where have I heard that name before?",Cobra

It's especially funny to watch Nielson pass off as a credible actress, she was awful in everything else she did, why not here? Yup, you guessed it, bad too!

100,jhaggardjr,Entertaining but sleazy,6,30 April 2001,"""Cobra"" is not one of Sylvester Stallone's worst movies. Some people might say it is, but I disagree. However, it's not one of his best movies either. I found it to be an average picture, nothing more than that. It has exciting action scenes (with the exception of the conclusion), some dark scary moments, and another hero played by Stallone who was about to turn this into another franchise following Rocky and Rambo. ""Cobra"" didn't jolt the box office into the record books and therefore there were no sequels to this. That was good, because we didn't need to see ""Cobra 2"", ""Cobra 3"", etc. On the downside, the movie is so sleazy and ugly that it became such a downer. Plus, it's incredibly stupid, with incredibly stupid supporting characters. I loved Leonard Maltin's review of this film. I totally agree with him when he said in his review of ""Cobra"" quote: ""Typical low-grade action fare, where all the other cops are stubborn dummies and all the bad guys are repellent creeps"". He nailed it on the dot with that quote. But as a whole, I liked the movie a little better than he did. Like I said, good action sequences that kept me entertained, but too dreary. Also, it has the former Mrs. Stallone, Brigitte Nielsen, on hand. She made this at the time when she was married to the action star.**1/2 (out of four)",Cobra
101,mcfly-31,slithering hilarity...,6,21 March 2010,"Hard to believe this is the film Sly wanted to turn ""Beverly Hills Cop"" into. You'll notice a ""based on the book"" credit in the opening titles, but I feel that was just a courtesy. Paula Gosling's novel was (apparently) based on a woman who falls in love with her cop-protector. The amount of the book used probably amounts to that previous line.From there, Sly puts his own unmistakably vain 80s stamp on this gut-busting mess, which he at least makes watchable in that ""what a POS"" kinda way. Penned by the man himself, in full self-serving flower, he plays yet another near-comatose renegade. Always adorned in mirrored sunglasses, scratchy beard, and obligatory mouth-matchstick, he mumbles his way through dialogue I can't imagine him not howling at as he typed it.Obviously inspired by the ""Night Stalker"" killings of the previous year (1985), he gives his villain the similar moniker of the ""Night *Slasher*."" His change to the actual events is that it's not just one psycho, but a group of them, who spend countless hours in a factory, clanging hatchet blades together and spouting interminable rhetoric about ""The New World."" Our first evidence of this is the utterly infamous opening sequence involving a supermarket nutbag.Upon randomly blasting a number of Charmin and Cocoa Pebbles buyers, Stallone's ""Cobra"" is called in to put a stop to the madness. No mention is made of him being a hostage negotiator; he just roars up in an aged car and storms the building, to the dismay of his cop-detractors. Several memorable one-liners later, we're off to the main plot involving Nielsen's character being targeted by said wacko regime.Throw in some Rambo, Friday the 13th slasher elements, and Halloween II hospital madness, and you have ""Cobra."" You know you're in bad shape when the first MTV montage is only about twenty minutes in. Then at the hour mark the film's tank hits empty, limping to its 600 shot-dead motorcyclists and steel factory finale.With all that said, if you like embarrassing star-trips, you may last through the whole thing. Sly's knee-slapper characterization (bumping gang-bangers cars, using a remote control despite being inches from his TV) has enough stunningly stupid moments to pull you along. There's also eye-squinters like the bad lady cop who speaks at times like a drag queen, and the innumerable amount of back-up nutcases who show up on motorbikes, who had not been seen to that point.Not to be overlooked, Sly even gives himself John Wayne's original given first name: Marion. The ultimate thrill would be to sit down with him to watch this thing, no doubt counting the times he puts his hand up over his face in shame.",Cobra
102,Cinemaniac1984,"Not the greatest movie, but a worthy time filler.",6,9 June 2016,"Despite Cobra developing into a cult movie, many agree that this is not a memorable movie for Sylvester Stallone. The plot is somewhat nonsensical, it is riddled with 80's cheese and glam, and the villains are over the top. Many could pick the movie apart but that would just make them dislike Cobra a lot more. While Cobra was a box office hit in 1986, many critics disliked the movie dismissing it as unoriginal, derivative and unpleasantly violent.Cobra starts off with a bang when a gunman (Marco Rodriguez) goes on a shooting spree in a supermarket and takes hostages. Lieutenant Marion Cobretti aka Cobra (Sylvester Stallone) sneaks into the store, locates, and is able to negotiate with the gunman. Armed with a sawn-off shotgun and homemade bomb, the gunman starts to rant about the rise of the New Order in society where they crush the weak and strongest and smartest rule the world. Though Cobretti neutralises the situation, he is berated by Detective Monte (Andrew Robinson) for his blatant disregard for police procedures with Cobretti's renegade methods for using violence as a means to an end to take down violent criminals. The supermarket incident is one of many random and brutal thrill killings that are reoccurring throughout Los Angeles. The killing sprees are led by 'The Night Slasher' (Brian Thompson) who is also behind the rise of the New Order. The LAPD is at a loss to explain why these killings are occurring and many citizens are living in fear. Cobretti and his partner Sergeant Gonzales (Reni Santoni) finally have a lead when they are assigned to protect model Ingrid Knudsen (Brigitte Nielsen) when she becomes a witness to the Night Slasher's crimes. Cobretti and Gonzales successfully repel further attempts on Ingrid's life by the Night Slasher and his supremacist followers. Though Cobretti's prophecies about the rise of a supremacist army fall on deaf ears, Captain Sears (Art La Fleur) authorises Cobretti and Gonzales to relocate Ingrid into a safehouse outside of Los Angeles.Sylvester Stallone, who also wrote the movie, does what he does best by kicking butt and take names as Marion Cobretti. While I love him in the Rocky and Rambo series, as well as Cop Land (1997) Cobra was not one of his most memorable movies. Cobra might be good to revisit every now and then but it is certainly not on my top list. I forgot how hokey the movie was, and some parts I had a groan to myself at how corny some parts of the movie were.Brian Thompson, who has since forged a cult following as an actor, made a formidable villain who faces off against Sylvester Stallone.Reni Santoni and Andrew Robinson, who were in Dirty Harry (1971) as Harry's rookie partner and the main villain respectively, reunite here as Cobretti's partner and Cobretti's pencil pushing detective who his openly critical of Cobretti and his unorthodox methods (more or less a homage to Clint Eastwood's Harry Callahan).Brigitte Nielsen wasn't the most memorable as Ingrid, the model who finds her life turned upside down after being placed into protective custody after she witnesses a murder.The late George P. Cosmatos who directed Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985) and Tombstone (1993) did his best with what he had but apparently it was Sylvester Stallone who was the main driving force behind Cobra.Apparently Cobra suffered through a lot of re-editing and Sylvester Stallone wielding a lot of power to have the movie edited into a manageable length and not as graphically violent. Who knew what the movie would be like if it wasn't slashed up (so to speak).Cobra has earned its reputation as a cult movie however over time it hasn't really aged that well. It is a good time filler to revisit very occasionally however, as awesome as Sylvester Stallone is, Cobra was not the most memorable movie.6/10.",Cobra

'Cobra' must fight both against a Nazi-Satanist cult fueling extremely lawless, ruthless and violent far-right maniacs and the puppets of a corrupt, hypocritical and sick system that cares more about the rights of the criminals than those of the victims.Cobretti has had enough of the fascists who protect the aggressors and accuse the victims, and when fierce creatures rape and kill innocent victims in excruciating suffering, when they enjoy committing such horrific crimes and take intense pleasure in doing so, when a society and its 'justice' accepts this fact by not strongly condemning these dreadful acts - whether it is a question of will, capacity or corruption - Marion is a Humanist, who protects the most basic of all Human Rights: The Right To Life!What do criminals who are infatuated with having other people suffering atrociously deserve?

The result is what you would expect from the man riding high on his roles in the ""Rocky"" franchise and ""First Blood"". Stallone struts around chewing on a match, wearing slick, tight clothes and muttering cheesy lines like ""You're the disease, I'm the cure"" and racks up a body-count of 40 plus with his Jatimatic submachine gun - a very quirky weapon that never saw mass-production. The film also contains the most outrageous hand-break turn in cinema history. Stallone plays Marion Cobretti - the cop LAPD call in when they are dealing with situations that no other cop can deal with, apparently. Essentially, they just call him in when they want some dirt bag laced with bullets. There's an apparent serial killer on the loose in LA, slashing random people to death. When the model Ingrid (Brigitte Nielson) sees the culprit in action, she becomes the next target, and Cobretti is detailed to protect her. It turns out that they are not dealing with one twisted killer, but a whole legion of them, and they are organised and even have connections...""Cobra"" was never going to be more than braindead action but that is the appeal, and Stallone never has notions beyond that. He set out to make and star in the film he wanted, which is a credit to him. He shamelessly turns himself into a marketable product like Pepsi and Coors - two brands that feature throughout the movie - but what a fun, testosterone-dripping piece of work this is; a quintessential '80s action movie. According to the trivia section on IMDb, Sylvester Stallone complained to cinematographer Ric Waite that they were falling behind, and said he and his crew needed to work harder. Waite reportedly responded by saying that maybe if Stallone ""gets his hands off Brigitte Nielsen's ass and stops showing off to his bodyguards"" then maybe they'd be up to speed!

First came Rocky, then he was Rambo, and now Sylvester Stallone (""The Specialist,"" ""Cliffhanger,"" ""Tango & Cash"") plays his toughest character yet as a police officer dirtier than Harry, who must protect a beautiful witness from a cult of serial killers. Explosive action from the director of ""Rambo: First Blood Part II.""I am fan of Cobra with Rambo: First Blood Part II, Rambo III, Rambo, Hard Target and Predator 2 it is in my top favorite action movies. Sylvester Stallone is Lieutenant Marion ""Cobra"" Cobretti, a Los Angeles police detective one man army against an army of killers. With his pearl-handled colt .45, laser-mount submachime and grenades he is a bad-ass the strong arm of the law. ""This is where the law stops and I start... sucker!"" This is my comic book hero my superhero and I love Marion Cobretti so much. I love his car, his gun his sun glasses this to me is an action hero ever.""In America, there's a burglary every 11 seconds, an armed robbery every 65 seconds, a violent crime every 25 seconds, a murder every 24 minutes and 250 rapes a day. ""I know this movie is not likeable by many people I love this movie to death, it grow on me. George P. Cosmatos directed Rambo: First Blood Part II and Cobra. He directed this action masterpiece brilliant. Some people are saying that Stallone more directed the film not George P. Cosmatos whoever did, It did a great job. It is a top notch pure action , pure Adrenaline pure Testosterone that movies nowdays don't have. No CGI in the 80's all done for real, real actions, real explosions. Real practical effects, all done for real.Stallone's best performance. Brigitte Nielsen is beautiful and gorgeous she looks like my mom like a model my mom was in the 80's. Brian Thompson was great as a Night Slasher. ""The Night Slasher"" is actually based on a real serial killer Richard Ramirez ""The Night Stalker"" he was a psycho in 1985 before he got caught. So the movie wasn't fiction at all, it was realistic. A murderous cult believes in a New World and they start killing off people one by one in Los Angeles. They kill the weak so that strongets survive. A cop must protect the only witness. I understood what the movie was about. I love the night scenes filmed I just love everything about this film.Cobra to me is better than The Terminator (1984) or Raw Deal (1986) that Arnold Schwarzenegger made money and profit out of it. Cobra chews and spits these movies. Since Rambo: Last Blood come out this year all people are rushing to see that movie that made money profit. I rather watch Cobra. I will never choose new movies over Cobra. I love Rambo: First Blood Part II, Rambo III, Rambo (2008), Cobra, Hard Target, Predator 2, I will never choose Rambo 5 over those movies.This is old school 80's action film where heroes were born. Chuck Norris was born in 1985 with his action movie Invasion U.S.A that's what I mean that is one of Chuck Norris bad-ass action films. This is mine Cobra I love this film to death. It is an action slasher film. I am not the only one who likes this movie. I would say Rambo: First Blood Part II, Rambo III and Cobra are underrated action films. I love love Rambo: First Blood Part II and Rambo III to death I am always greatful for my mom giving me money so I could rent Rambo III on VHS as a kid. I have a beautiful childhood memorie on that movie.I love Cobra blasting bikers to pices or he shoots bad guys with his colt .45 gun but I absolutelly love his Submachine gun Jatimatic SMG with laser. I love how they filmed the film it is an anwser to Dirty Harry. I love the soundtracks: Feel the Heat by Jean Beauvoir, Hold on to Your Vision by Gary Wright and Angel of the City by Robert Tapper. The movie is fast paced, it is short and of course it was the first Stallone's action movie that wasn't Rocky or Rambo movie.Rambo: First Blood Part II, Rambo III and Rambo (2008) and Cobra are the best action movies that come out ever on this planet. I am a huge Stallone fan I love this movie to death.Cobra is my personal favorite bad-ass action movie of the 80's ever period.",Cobra
109,ReelCheese,Neither Particularly Good Nor Awful,5,13 May 2007,"When critics complain that Sylvester Stallone is failing to adequately use his talent, COBRA is the sort of effort they're talking about. This is one Stallone probably wishes he had back, but the truth is, there's been much worse. The end result is something that is neither particularly good nor particularly awful. Here Sly is a workaholic, tough-as-cinder-blocks, matchstick chomping (don't ask) cop on the trail of a deranged serial killer. Some of the sequences are semi-suspenseful, and Stallone makes a great hard-ass police officer, but COBRA too often feels like a low-rent Charles Bronson actioneer. The violence is contrived, and the ending is particularly unpleasant. For die-hard Stallone fans.",Cobra

111,stormhawk2021,One of my favorite 80's action films,10,14 May 2017,"Cobra has had the reputation of being a Dirty Harry rip-off, and in many ways it is. However, this is still an entertaining action movie that doesn't deserve the flack it received. I agree that the movie is imperfect and it does look dated, but nonetheless it is a fun movie. Director George P. Cosmatos, who is most famous for directing Rambo First Blood Part II and Tombstone, directs, and he knows how to make effective mindless movies that are fun. I really enjoyed this film, and though it's a clichéd affair, it's quite good in its own right. If you love 1980's action films that are low budget, this is a perfect film to enjoy. The performances are decent at best, but the action is what keeps you involved. The plot does suffer, but what do you expect from a low budget action feature? This is meant to be a popcorn flick, nothing more, and it succeeds at it very well. There were better films than Cobra during the 80's, especially the bigger productions such as Die Hard, but if you enjoy these films, then give it a shot. I found Cobra to be a flawed film with an average script, but it delivered in its action content, and if you're an action film fan, that's all that matters. I thought that Sylvester Stallone's performance was pretty good considering that this is such an overlooked film. He has had better roles, but in Cobra he's perfect for the part and it's hard to imagine someone else in the role. Like I said, this is a good movie that is flawed, but it more than makes up for the lacking material with its tense action. The film is cheesy at times, but it's what makes it all enjoyable.",Cobra

Groovy, funny, over-the-top bombastic, violent, and verbally effective and catchy. Such movies are not as numerous as you would think. A perfect entertainment for a cosy evening. Shut the lights, pop in the DVD, and enjoy the brutal superhuman powers of the 1980s cinema heroes. They are stuck in those dark gracious times and in our memories forever.Of course it will never hit the same heights as ""First Blood"" (that one IS phenomenal) but it rubs shoulders with ""Commando"", ""Return of the Dragon"", ""Armour of God"", ""Black Eagle"", and other cool movies about cool guys.It is simply outstanding how the American directors of the 1980s could with ease blend over-the-top violence and tongue-in-cheek comedy together.Funny, violent, ridiculous, bloody, laughable, grisly... These are the best words to describe ""Cobra"" substance and the way it is presented. The name ""Cosmatos"" also sounds... well... groovy...8 out of 10. Thanks for attention.",Cobra
114,happyendingrocks,One look at the poster will tell you everything you need to know about whether you will enjoy this movie or not,7,25 April 2011,"This Sylvester Stallone action vehicle is assuredly a goofy mess, but since it embodies all of the best elements of cheesy '80s action movies, there's still something inherently awesome about it no matter how nonsensical the majority of the film is.Sly portrays Marion ""Cobra"" Cobretti, the type of cop that only exists in movies like these, who flagrantly disregards the law while zealously upholding it and uses deadly force as often as most police officers issue parking citations. While on the hunt for a ruthless serial killer, Cobra finds himself appointed personal protector for a witness who becomes targeted by the murderer. The witness happens to be a model portrayed by Brigitte Nielsen, and that part of the subplot pretty much writes itself from that point.This rather simple premise is augmented by the twist that the ""Night Slasher"" Sly is hunting is actually part of a band of similarly-minded blood-crazed killers who gather in the sewers to stand in yoga class formations and clang their axes together. Since the plot primarily focuses on the handiwork of the ""Slasher"", it's never made clear exactly what function the rest of his cult-like peers serve, although there seems to be a virtual army of them given the impressive number of henchmen who attack Stallone and Nielsen during the film's climactic gun-battle.The ""Slasher"" is ably portrayed by the menacing Brian Thompson, who looks like a vicious killer whether he's playing one or not. Thompson's serial murderer is a perpetually sweaty and scowling figure whose singular character trait in the film is that he likes grunting and stabbing people.Every action movie ""supercop"" is partially defined by his obvious superiority to his department's inept top brass, and Cobra gets the perfect foil in Andrew Robinson's Monte. In one of the finest bits of police stupidity ever portrayed in the genre, Monte refuses to believe Cobra's assertion that there are multiple murderers at large, despite the fact that Cobra guns down a group of masked, axe-wielding killers a few minutes before Monte voices his skepticism.Among the film's highlights is one of those car chases that could only appear in an '80s action flick, during which Cobra engages in a lengthy and treacherous pursuit while the woman he's supposed to be protecting is in the car with him. Despite the chase exposing Nielsen to an onslaught of gunfire and concluding in a horrifying crash which totals Cobra's car and would have most assuredly killed both of them if this wasn't a movie, Cobra's model/witness continues to steadfastly depend on him to keep her safe.The most noteworthy thing about Stallone's love subplot with Nielsen isn't that they have zero chemistry on screen, it's the knowledge that despite the mechanical lack of sex appeal displayed by both of them, they actually became a couple in real life. In the film, their romantic pairing is rendered especially silly by a glaring reality that no amount of movie magic can hide: Nielsen is about 8 feet taller than Sly. The one scene that attempts to show us the attraction brewing between them features one of the clumsiest come-ons you'll ever see, when Stallone watches Nielsen cover her french fries with a deluge of ketchup and utters the immortally clever line, ""You got a life preserver?... Cause your fries are drowning."" In fact, the opportunity for Stallone to mumble Ah-nuld-esque one-liners seems to be one of the driving forces behind the film. (My personal favorite: ""This is where the law stops, and I start... sucker"").Though Cobra never comes close to matching any of the best films on Arnold Schwarzenegger's classic '80s genre roster, this humble offering doesn't skimp on the action, and Sly handily proves himself capable of carrying a non-Rambo film on his own. His climactic massacre of the swarming band of murderers is an ambitiously epic sequence loaded with ample explosions and thrilling stunts, not to mention a body count that just won't quit, and his final showdown with Thompson boasts some truly priceless dialogue (and spittle) while bringing the film to a nifty conclusion.Regardless of how utterly ridiculous most of this movie is if you really sit down and think about it, Cobra is still a very fun and very entertaining time capsule for any fan of B-grade '80s action films. If you fall into that category, this outing is most definitely worth 85 minutes of your life.",Cobra
115,ivanmessimilos,Action classic,7,7 September 2020,"I may not be objective when it comes to action movies from the 80s or 90s of the last century, but I can by no means classify them as bad movies. I watch them through nostalgic glasses because these very action heroes were my first idols that I followed with admiration on small screens. I didn't care about the acting, or the story, or the plot, or the development of the characters, or the landscapes, or the atmosphere of the film, absolutely nothing mattered except that the main protagonist, who must be a real deal, would beat or shoot dozens of irrelevant characters and then in the end, also ruthlessly, after a great fight, to take down the main villain. This is a generic description of most action movies from their golden age, so this movie is no exception.Stallone plays Lieutenant Cobretti, aptly nicknamed Cobra, who is called upon to handle extremely dangerous situations. We quickly get to know what kind of character he is, he wears sunglasses, chews a match in his mouth, has a picture of a cobra on his gun, cuts pizza with scissors, lives on the edge of the law and practically kills anyone who gets in his way even though he is a police officer. As I already wrote,he is the man. The plot of the film is actually irrelevant and short, one cult kills people, the police are powerless, Cobra has to protect the only surviving witness they want to kill and that's it. The film is quite short, not even 90 minutes, so they didn't want to waste time on unimportant things like logical dialogues or a meaningful story. We can also say that there are elements of horror because of the way the villain slowly approaches the victims overnight and kills them with his big, specially designed knife. The film was considered quite violent because of the murders and did not get good reviews, but it still earned a lot and today is even considered an action classic. The film kills 52 people, and Cobretti himself is responsible for the deaths of 41 of them. A ruthless killing machine.
The director of the film is George Cosmatos who had already shot Rambo 2 a year earlier which has the same premise, and there is also the lead role of Stallone. The main female role is played by Stallone's then-wife Brigitte Nielsen with whom he filmed Rocky 4, and the following year they divorced. As they had a marriage, so did they make a film, short and without much meaning, but with a lot of shooting.The film is exactly what it pretends to be, an action shooter of a character who himself takes down dozens of villains with a gun and then finally says one of his one liners.You're a disease, and I'm the cure.

118,homecoming8,Underrated but Highly Entertaining Action Classic !!!,9,9 February 2010,"""THIS IS WHERE THE LAW STOPS, AND I START.. SUCKER!"" Just one of the great lines in this action classic.""Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985) was one of the biggest commercial movie hits from the '80's. Shortly after, director George Pan Cosmatos and action superstar Sylvester Stallone were once again reunited for 1986's ""Cobra"". It was not as big as ""Rambo"" but it did play in a record-breaking number of theaters in it's opening weekend back in 1986. The press was very negative which was bad for the smashing commercial success this movie could have been eventually. Strange, since they did not receive any screening copies in fear of bad publicity.After 25 years, it is still a great action flick. The kind you do not see anymore. It still is not outdated, because ""Cobra"" features state of the art weaponry and a great car that still amazes the audience now. The cast and supporting cast is quit good: Reni Santoni reprises his role from another action classic, ""Dirty Harry"" (1971). In that one he also played the partner of the leading cop, Clint Eastwood's Harry Callahan in that movie. And ""Cobra"" is a modern adaptation from the ""Dirty Harry"" movies. Andrew Robinson is well known for his leading role in the horror classic ""Hellraiser"" (1987) and was also in movies like ""Pumpinhead II"" (1993). But his best part is playing the psycho killer in.. ""Dirty Harry"" ! Art LeFleur was in Van Damme's ""Death Warrant"" (1990). And let's not forget Brigitte Nielsen ! She is a Danish model and was at the time actually Stallone's wife ! Her part is OK, she was better in ""Rocky IV"" as Ivan Drago's (Dolph Lundgren) wife, she has some really good scenes in that one.""Cobra"" is a violent, macho action movie. The ending was brutal, reminded me of the final scene ""Exterminator 2"" (1984). So I understand why people do not like this movie. The same people that do not like movies like ""Death Wish"" and ""The Exterminator"".But if you want hard-hitting, brutal and explosive '80's action at it's best, ""Cobra"" is the one to watch. The great final 20 minutes can be compared to the explosive finals of movies like ""Commando"" or ""Hard Target"": They just do not make them like they used to.. too bad.",Cobra
119,erwan_ticheler,Very good.......if you appreciate fascism,6,24 May 2003,"Cobra is probably the worst movie ever,together with the other Sly movie Rambo 3.What makes it so bad is the message of the movie and of Stallone since he wrote the screenplay.It all comes down to this:If you are a criminal and by any chance a murderer,you don't have rights and you should be killed without prosecution.This message is to me the message of a pure fascist!The rest of the story is also inferior,together with the usual parody of acting by Stallone.If it wasn't for the first Rocky I would say that Stallone also plays in very bad movies.Still,he is of course the worst actor of all time.This movie only makes that even more clear.However,if you like this kind of stuff this is your movie to watch.

120,nims-1975,"Wow man, I love this film and it was absolutely awesome with high powered action",10,27 July 2019,"Cobra is an absolutely brilliant film starring Sylvester Stallone and Brigitte Nielsen. The film is about how the streets of LA are becoming a danger zone for the residents because a group of malicious and maniacal killers lead by the malicious and maniacal terrorist The Night Slasher. The cops are finding it too chaotic and dangerous to deal with because of these maniacs so they have to ask for somebodies help. Lt Marion Cobretti aka Cobra(played by Sylvester Stallone) is a cop who the other cops don't like because he has his own way of dealing with the killers which is a very powerful and brutal way. So many peoples have been torn apart because of the dangerous Night Slasher and his maniacal killers. Even Model and businesswoman Ingrid Knudsen(played by Brigitte Nielsen) becomes terrorized, but when Cobra saves her, she and Cobra become closer. An Undercover cop called Nancy Stalk(played by Lee Garlington) becomes involved with Cobra in the search for The Night Slasher and his terrrorist gang, but suspicions grow and Cobra and Ingrid become very suspicious about her and find out that she's linked to The Night Slasher and his terrorist gang. Cobra has a lot to deal with but is also assisted by Tony Gonzales(played by Reni Santoni) and is out there to kill the malicious and maniacal man The Night Slasher and his terrorist gang. The film was full of very intense, dramatic, scary and high powered action with awesome fight scenes, explosions and loads more. It is a film which Stallone fans will love and it definitely doesn't disappoint.

Brian Thompson and Lee Garlinton did excellent acting as the malicious and vicious criminals The Night Slasher and Nancy Stalk. The Night Slasher and Nancy Stalk were part of a big gang of malicious and vicious criminals who killed people using Axes etc during the night and day and Cobra a very tough and powerful cop was out to get his revenge by stopping deaths of innocent people happening by killing these malicious and vicious criminals so that peace could be brought back to the city.

121,Benjamin_Cox,Venomous - 43%,4,18 July 2012,"Aaah, Sylvester Stallone. Forever in the shadow of fellow bodybuilder-turned-actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, his movies have always tended to lack a certain something. Aside from a couple of classics like ""Rocky"", his action outings tend to have a gimmicky feel like ""Demolition Man"" and its semi-futuristic mayhem and as an actor, his monotone delivery leaves much to be desired. However, he does have his fans and I suspect that they'll lap up this mid-Eighties effort because as far as I can tell, this is a film about how macho Sly can look at any given moment.Sly plays Marion ""The Cobra"" Cobretti, a hard-as-nails street cop who commands fear from his colleagues rather than respect. Only his partner Gonzales (Reni Santoni) seems to be able to work with him as the city is gripped with fear due to a crazed serial killer known as the Night Slasher (Brian Thompson). Cobretti's unconventional style seems suited to best cracking the case and when a witness emerges in the form of bouffant-haired waitress Ingrid (Brigitte Nielsen), Cobretti and Gonzales must keep her safe from the Night Slasher who appears to be just one member of a crazed biker cult.This is famously the movie that Sly wanted ""Beverly Hills Cop"" to be when he was offered the part - a more violent and less amusing action-cop thriller - but as it turns out, ""Cobra"" is by far the weaker movie. Despite a running time of less than 90 minutes, this drags on as the baddies flash their shiny knives in moody lighting while Stallone struts around the place looking as macho as possible. His character couldn't feel more like a cardboard cut-out if he went all wrinkled in the rain - you know that the only reason he has a match in his mouth is just in case a baddie gets covered in petrol but hey, at least his jeans are super-tight! I'm also fairly sure that grenades and machine guns with laser-sights aren't standard police-issue but how else is he to take care of the baddies? Nothing about the movie feels special or note-worthy in any way and certainly nothing that you haven't seen a dozen times in other films. Acting is pretty much what you expect in a Stallone film although Nielsen is astonishingly unconvincing, considering all she has to do is scream and go gooey-eyed at Stallone (who was still her husband then!).The film's biggest problem is that it simply doesn't feel like a quality product. The opening sequence in particular feels like a music video with odd screen effects, close-ups of the motorbikes spinning wheels and the clanging of axes which, I noticed, the killers hardly ever used. The action, I suppose, is satisfying when it does arrive but only in a mid-Eighties kinda way - big pointless explosions, stock sound effects in a fist fight, you know the sort of thing. But throughout the film, I kept wondering why Stallone thought this would have been better than ""Beverly Hills Cop"". ""Cobra"" is a film with little in the way of fun in it, it's a film that's far too serious despite the supposedly humorous interaction between Cobretti & Gonzales. When Ingrid asks him ""Do you ever get involved?"", he answers ""With a woman?"" as if he's not sure what one is. This is a shallow, joyless excuse for Stallone to try and look good while blowing away loads of anonymous baddies - remind you of any other Stallone movies you may have seen?",Cobra

As long as you're not expecting too much, it delivers on a no-brainer level. In fact it's about as good as one can expect from anything Cannon Films did in the eighties. It moves at a good pace, looks slick (groovy lighting) and has a decent car chase. As expected, it's very right-wing, but as long as the occasional speechifying doesn't bother you too much, that kinda adds to its charm as an artifact of its decade.

How could you possibly think this was worthy of feature film release, where people actually PAY hard-earned money to see something like this? The first time I saw this, I sat there in stunned disbelief at the utter stylish incompetence exhibited throughout this film.Then I found, to my surprise, that I was actually entertained by how bad this was. Now I watch it every chance I get. Perhaps that was what they were shooting for. I am so fascinated by how bad this truly is. Was Stallone spoofing this, or was he really trying to create a character who we should actually take seriously? I don't know...hard to tell. In movies like ""Demolition Man"" and ""Judge Dredd"", you understood what they were, and Stallone jumped into the cartoonish characters with enthusiasm. It's hard to tell exactly what he's going for in ""Cobra"". His character, maverick Detective Marion Cobretti, is really nothing more than a slug. No personality and grunting is his communication method, along with bad one-liners.

It's just lazy writing all around with no redeeming qualities of any sort.The only few enjoyable moments are in the first act where the action sets the movie up and introduces Stallone's badass cop character. It's cheesy but it's fun cheesy.Overall, it's just a bad movie with a nonsensical plot, but at least Stallone looked cool as hell so maybe there's that.",Cobra
129,mat-mcnaughton-254-33257,Sy is quite a strange guy.,5,18 November 2012,"This has been the most enjoyable 'How Did This Get Made' movie so far. It's an 80s Stallone vehicle that should stay in the 80s, but it's still really funny and at times, confusing as hell. But in case you actually want to watch it, I won't spoil anything. Sylvester Stallone plays what seems to be the least ish-giving cop on the force who everyone hates but still let do his job. The romantic interest is the girl he's protecting, Brigitte Nielsen, inexplicably wears wigs throughout the entire movie. (It's that type of movie.) The villains are an ax-wielding gang of weirdos who the police are certain is one guy. There are car chases, explosions, and monotone one-liners aplenty in this film. I'd totally recommend it to Stallone wannabes.",Cobra
130,alahmed-55673,Good film with great badass ruthless yet smooth and romantic main character. Underrated,9,1 December 2020,"One of the toughest manliest most badass main characters I have ever seen what I like about his character is he doesn't care about the law. He's an excellent cop but when he catches maniac killers he kill them with no hesitation. Thats rare. Reminds me of John wick.
When he confronted the main bad guy The main criminal said you can't kill me that's against the law even I a crazy serial killer have rights. Stallon said well here's where the law stops and i start sucker! And he tortured the main bad guys in the end. I pretty much enjoyed that. The revenge was very satisfactory.The film overall is nice and enjoyable but has a little bit of boring scenes. And a little bit of poor scenery's thats could've been done Way better.But the film was made in 1986. So I have to give it credit. I have to give this film a 9 out of 10 because of the badass and ruthless but yet smooth and romantic main character.",Cobra
131,BlueSkies765,This is where the law stops and I start,8,24 September 2019,A dark and gritty movie from the 80s. How can law enforcement constrained by civility win against the bad guys who are unrestrained in their evil? I think Cobra perfectly captures the tone of a lawless society. It's unsettling at times and makes you think about what if it would happen for real? I think the dark atmosphere created by the director and the choice of actors make Cobra a memorable movie.,Cobra
132,trevorwomble,Really cheesy but watchable 80s Dirty Harry clone,6,6 November 2018,"This film really is the biggest cheese fest from the Cannon films stable. It has its moments and is competently directed but it lacks any surprises.The film rocks along at a decent pace and unlike other Cannon films of the mid 80s it actually has some decent production values and a decent budget. A half decent cast helps it too (although Brigitte Nielsen wears a very unconvincing 1989s big hair wig).The story itself of a woman being pursued by a dangerous psycho gang and needing the protection of an unorthodox cop (Stallone) is reminiscent of the Clint Eastwood film 'The Gauntlet' made a decade earlier. In fact I think this is Stallone's attempt to become the new Eastwood but for all the gloss of this film it fails because it is so unoriginal and predictable.The Eastwood comparison is even obvious in the casting with Andrew Robinson from Dirty Harry (1971) having a significant role. And the dialogue also leaves a lot to be desired in places, being ridiculously corny in places.Time hasn't been kind either for this film reeks of the 1980s, not just in the fashions but in the forgettable rock soundtrack. Having said that Stallone does look ridiculously cool in his black leather jacket, shades and vintage
souped up car, even if he does sport the clichéd nickname 'Cobra' for his character Marion Cobretti.So to summarize, this is a big budget but very average effort (although quite good by Cannon films standards). It certainly isn't anywhere near as good as the Mel Gibson/Danny Glover action movie Lethal Weapon which came out the following year, which managed to have a sense of humour
and some great acting despite the even sillier plot. But having said that 'Cobra' is still a serviceable and competent if unexceptional and unoriginal action film.",Cobra
133,phillafella,Another Ludicrous Stallone Vehicle.,2,11 April 2003,"COBRA is a desperately unpleasant action vehicle for Stallone, who must protect a model from a hit man's gang.  You can see why he ditched BEVERLY HILLS COP for this clunker because his performance here is ludicrous, and the actors act like idiots.  Brigitte Nielsen, who was once Stallone's wife, looks attractive, and some of the action scenes are bearable, but not even that can save this piece of trash.  A pitiful rip-off of Dirty Harry that also has one of the sleaziest soundtracks ever contributed to a motion picture.1 out of 5",Cobra

It ain't exactly revolutionary cinema or riveting art-house fare (duh!), but it is however, one of the iconic images of the glorious 80's American pop culture. This is a page of History! For those who have a soft spot for 80's movies and the campy genre in particular, ""Cobra"" should definitely get special credit. You've got to admire Stallone for not trying to pose as something that he's not. He's no Shakespearean actor and never claimed to be one.

135,tenthousandtattoos,Corn-Cobra,5,12 February 2008,"Los Angeles, 1986. A band of killers is stalking randoms on the mean streets of the City of Angels. The by-the-book, Malibu-livin, Lexus-drivin cops are clueless. Meet John Rambo, um, I meanMarion Cobretti (Sylvester Stallone), a street tough cop with an attitude.What I find hard to believe is that this cheesy piece of cinema was actually based on a novel. What I find EASY to believe is that Stallone wrote the screenplay. This was 1986  back when Stallone was still regularly receiving blows to the head. And it shows. This was also during the time when Stallone and Schwarzenegger had a weird ""who's the biggest tough guy"" run of movies. By and large, Arnie's hold up better these days, but that's not to say Stallone was not also capable of delivering some fun.The fun begins with the infamous supermarket hold up. Forget the goofs, this is a great scene! The dumbass cops outside simply surround the place and try to negotiate. Pfft! Then ""the Cobra"" shows up, and just wades on in. Innocent bystanders? Please. I love the end, where he helps a woman to her feet. Notice she's a pretty girl  forget helping the poor old guy huddled in his wheelchair or the pregnant mom cowering over in frozen goods, no, Sly reaches out to the only attractive woman in the place. That's my boy.Then he goes home to his beachfront apartment where he snacks on a frozen piece of pizza (I swear he takes it out of the freezer not the fridge) while he cleans his gun and watches the news. This is a complicated individual we're dealing with here.I love bad guys in these 80's actioners. They are just totally dedicated to being bad guys! These aren't complicated units were dealing with here. These guys are from the old bad-guy school - they don't have lives, wives, kids or personal affairs, nor do they have complicated reasons for why they were forced into lives of crime...no, in their spare time they sit around in warehouses playing with knives. They gather in abandoned buildings, where they stand in line dancing rows clapping shiny new axes together in a weird bad-guy symphony. Whatever. Anyway, I love that they appear to be a cross-section of society (we see suits alongside leathers at the axe-dance) united in wanting to start a new world order by killing off ""the weak""...exactly what they plan to do once they've finished with the weak is left to your imagination.And the cops! Stupid liberal tree-huggers! Sly knows that to really deal out some serious justice, all you need is some tight jeans, a big gun, an even bigger car, and of course, an Attitude. And Sly's got that in spades. He wades through this role in his leathers and sunnies, chewing on a match and spouting grumbly threats and grievances in between capping off bad guys left right and centre. He even finds time to crack onto a witness he's protecting, his then-wife Brigitte Nielsen of all people. Hence the strange montage early in the film that has her inexplicably dancing around a bunch of prop robots in a swimsuit. Okay And speaking of Brigitte Nielsen Good God...she's not ""eye candy"" she's goddamned eye beef-jerky...how Stallone could tap that once, let alone marry it, is beyond me.Anyway, suffice it to say he manages to protect the witness, kill 32 more bad guys, and bait a meat hook with the main villain. Then he grabs his girl, punches out one of the liberal, tree huggin cops and rides off into the sunset on the bad guy's motorcycle. Oh yeah!",Cobra
136,MovieGuyFunTime,Dirty Harry on Steroids!,7,27 February 2021,"This film has all the classic elements of a Clint Eastwood Dirty Harry film: Renegade loner cop of few words working outside the system, a psychotic bad guy, a partner that gets shot and a big, BIG gun!In fact, it would not surprise me at all to learn that this film was originally planned as a Dirty Harry project but due to Eastwood's age and a similar plot element as a previous Dirty Harry film (evil cult), it may have simply been rewritten to suit a younger and even more ""Over the Top"" cop, Sly Stallone. Even the opening sequence featuring a pistol shooting at the viewer after some haunting narration is almost exactly like the opening sequence of Magnum Force (I believe).While the motivation for the ""bad guys"" is not very well explained or explored, they seem to be everywhere and highly dedicated to their cause which is apparently ushering in a ""new world order"" which also isn't very well explained. For all the blood that gets spilled in this movie, I would have liked to have had a bit more background into why all these people feel obligated to murder all the time for no reason... but maybe that's what makes them so bad. Evil doesn't particularly need a reason or an excuse to be evil.The action scenes are great as expected and the plot and other characters really only serve to justify the Rambo-with-a-badge moments (same director as Rambo). The movie boasts one of the best cars and car-chases ever filmed which is probably the highlight of the movie now that I think of it.Stallone (Cobra) attempts a few Dirty Harry-like one liners that come off a little forced and flat with dialog that is tough one second and awkwardly compassionate the next. But don't watch this movie for the snappy dialog or great acting... get it for the action scenes and for the underlying message which is: ""Some people need to be dealt with harshly because they are pure evil and do not deserve their day in court.""If this WERE a Dirty Harry film, I would say it is better than Dead Pool but not as good as any of the others. A decent-enough film for anyone who vicariously enjoys seeing satanic Marxist cults get destroyed with cool weaponry boasting bottomless ammo magazines.",Cobra

Cobra came along at the right time and thank God it did, unlike the films of today that have to be polished and conform to strict guidelines, Cobra made up its own rules and did whatever the Hell it wanted.It's cool without really trying at all, Stallone is slick and his appearance oozes machismo, his black mop of hair, the sunglasses that are more manly than anything you see in modern action films, his no nonsense attitude, man he'll kick your ass for just looking at him wrong, the plot is simple but oh boy does it work!The opening scene and the action within sets the tone and you know exactly what to expect from Cobra thereafter, a lone gunman walks into a supermarket, without warning or clear motive he begins to shoot up the place......In steps Marion Cobretti, more commonly known as Cobra, without breaking a sweat he immediately puts the scarers into the gunman before taking him down like a pro, awesome. What follows is a simple story of the police, plus Cobra, trying to take down a murderous cult who's sole intention is to kill, as simple as that, nothing fancy, nothing elaborate, just some plain old bad guys doing some seriously weird bad guy stuff. Personally I really enjoyed the car chase scene involving Cobra and a girl he has just rescued, Ingrid, chasing down the bad guys, again a simple car chase with some awesome, realistic stunts, like racing up and down a roller coaster of a road.Aww breathe it in, when action films were seriously cool, if you intend to watch Cobra, remember one thing, just enjoy it, nothing more, don't analyse it, don't expect extravagance, this is pure action from a bygone era, OH the 80's!",Cobra

Sure the film needs some work in the acting, plot, and dialogue department, but it has several enjoyable action scenes that are quite entertaining, including the opening shootout and the top notch car chase.  Sylvestor Stallone was trying to make a DIRTY HARRY style action film, and COBRA is definitely a lot like it, right down to having Reni Santoni as his partner, and having Andrew Robinson, this time as a cop rather than a killer.It's kind of sad that critics take this film seriously and thats why they give it bad reviews.

140,McFrogg,The Cobra: Darwin's Death Dealers,5,9 November 2017,"It's sad that Cobra is so darn violent, because it has a lot of good stuff in it, stuff like:1. How Cobra feels like something out of an old pulp magazine, like The Spider. The tough vigilante gunslinger dressed in black, a secret society of villains that are pure evil, helpless police, a super-fast car, a damsel in distress. It's a low budget movie that feels so big and epic. ""Cobra"" even sounds like the title of a pulp magazine. If you changed a few things, this could have been a pretty good Spider movie.2. The villains are scary, and believable. A secret society based on Darwinian principles. One can easily imagine a group of psychopaths inspired by someone like Richard Dawkins or Peter Singer kill off of people they deem ""weak"". And Brian Thompson is great as the boss. Almost makes me forget his role in Mortal Kombat: Annihilation.3. Robert Tepper's music sets the mood.4. Stallone as Cobra. He's a tough guy with a heart of gold. It's amazing that they didn't make more movies about this character. The matchstick, the sunglasses...he's so cool and tough that it becomes hilarious.5. Surprisingly, no unnecessary sex scenes/nudity. There is, however, some disturbing references to sexual violence, and the movie is pretty violent and gritty. I know, I know...it's an action movie where Rambo fights a gang of dangerous serial killers, but still. It is possible to make dark and gritty movies without all of the gory violence. And then there's the language. Had they toned it down a bit, I would have liked it much better.But, for all it's faults, I'll admit that Cobra still is a pretty exciting movie. A combination of pulse pounding action and chilling horror. If you like pulp magazines, you will probably like Cobra. And if you like Cobra, maybe you should check out some pulps?",Cobra

142,KillerLord,Classic Action Genre Movie,6,4 October 2008,"What does an action movie require? Unlike other movies, an action movie does not have to spend time exploring the development of the plot and the characters. The reason it is called an action movie is that it gets straight to the point. It is meant to show a scenario that sets the stage for people to battle each other, the type of resources that can be exploited to eliminate each other and viola - show the battle itself. Cobra fits this definition of an action movie perfectly. It starts out by showing the main exponent - Stallone. He plays Marion Cobretti, a bad cop with a weird lifestyle. Wears goggles, always carries a stick in his mouth and speaks very little. He does the fist do the talking more than his mouth. A tough guy and an inspiring one indeed. He starts out by handling a hostage situation and shows himself to be unconventional but effective in his methods of dealing with the crime.And next we are shown somebody witnessing an event and needs protection. And that's it - the stage is set. Marion needs to protect her and goes to any length in order to do so. From this point on, all the movie showcases is guns and blows from Stallone to all the bad guys. And viola, the movie ends. Of course, one cannot say that the movie can be watched again and again. But it is a fun movie to watch. Cute one liners, lots of action. But nothing more. Do not expect depth in story and characters. Just fun, mindless fun, that's all.",Cobra

Just don't expect a Stallone classic.,7,27 January 2020,"Look this is certainly not as fondly remembered or as great as Sly's finest flicks(mainly the Rambo movies plus Cliffhanger, Demolition Man or Copland), and it has some pretty wooden acting and a bit of daft plot if you think about it.But if you want a action movie that just goes to town on the gunfire, bonkers explosions and cheesy one liners, then Cobra is a good watch.I enjoyed it more a second time and as it was only about a hour and 25 minutes, so it never bored me or felt too long.Stallone's ultra macho Cobretti aka Cobra trying to save model Ingrid(played by real life wife at the time Brigitte Nielsen), from the bonkers Night Slasher and his crew, is a bit of silly plot tbh, that only really belongs in the 80s heyday of Sly(or Arnie and Van Damme).Saying that though the villain and his followers were darn good fun, and are pretty brutal throughout, butchering people for no reason in nasty ways(what he calls the weak of the population). That aspect of the movie worked a treat, especially when they just seem to love killing innocent folks, so as villains go Night Slasher was top notch(shame the very wooden Brian Thompson aka Shao Kahn from Mortal Kombat 2 played him again in a laughable way. Guy was huge though so he worked in the tough guy stakes).Its still great fun as I said, plus Sly utters some corking one liners, punches his boss at the end, looks awesome throughout and looks like he's having fun. Its action sequences too are great, especially the beginning with the supermarket thug and the shootout at the hideout.Just don't go expecting a Sly classic, a 80s classic or a top notch action flick, as it ain't.Just enjoy it for its cheesy appeal, its scary bad guy, Sly looking cool and its 80s type one liners(''Crime is a disease, I am the cure''.

I understand that Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger and other action stars were trying to make profit at the box-office and had all their different fan bases and stuff, but that doesn't mean that all their films were enjoyable. Now, I did love Arnold's ""COMMANDO"" because it had a basic premise, awesome ""over-the-top"" ( I just mentioned another Stallone stinker! ) violence and cool one-liners.

146,dixxjamm,The vivid imagination of a teenager gone haywire,3,23 May 2006,"And you know who that teenager is? Yes, it's Stallone. And he's been a teenager all his life. You remember when you were a kid/teenager and you played with toy guns? If you happened to be the good guy, you probably imagined shooting 100+ bad guys, saving the innocent, saving the beautiful girl, saving children, doing justice (maybe because you were frustrated because of the C- in Math and you wanted to kill the teacher). You remember how you felt small because the captain of the football team got all the attention and the girls? That you sometimes craved for attention from everybody, that you sometimes wanted to be the hero of the day? Well maybe not, but regardless of the frustrations and naive dreams that you may have had, most of us grew up. Stallone apparently didn't and he made movies. All his movies portray what he would like to be: that common man that became uncommon because of his deeds, and who shines like the sun and everybody looks up to him. And of course, doing it alone, all alone. No wonder he's a favorite with children, teens, bodyguards, night clerks, and other inherently frustrated people. Cobra is a perfect example of that Stallone ""wet dream"". I mean, cutting a pizza with scissors and eating it with his glove????? Oh right, he's an unconventional rebel helping people, Mr.Justice himself.And those bad guys keep coming in waves. Bring'em on, Cobretti is gonna waste all of you, preferably in as many ways as possible and without as much as getting a scratch. And the ammo never ends...And the main bad guy has too be clichéd, because it wouldn't fit with Stallone's fantasy if he wasn't.And of course he's a pain in the a*** with the police department, he is misunderstood in his methods...Well what can I say, I wouldn't trust a guy who cuts his pizza with a scissor either.

There's something about a New Order with quasi-religious stuff going on, but somehow it doesn't quite jibe with their main job of killing people at random.  It would be different if they were some sort of thrill kill cult, but no one seems to be having much fun. I guess one joins these guys, is issued a machine gun and a motorcycle, yells at some sweaty leader, and then drives around in a van holding people down for from guy called slasher to kill.  When Stallone shows up they drive into his bullets like lemmings.  The incompetence of the directing makes it look like they're doing it deliberately.  Never have anonymous villains had so little dignity in death.  (Except maybe for the storm troopers who got their butts whupped by Ewoks.)  The villains are almost abstract in their devotion to being part of the carnage at the end.The rest of the movie is not as remarkable in any way.  It's yet another action movie where the hero has to assault an enemy base/stronghold/hideout to extract the babe who got nabbed.  This one has a Dirty Harry character.",Cobra

He here again did not disappointed me but made me more enjoy and entertain through his artistic action ability. Playing a new breed of cop he really showed up as cure for the rapidly growing disease of crime. Fighting against a group of serial killer led by a ruthless psychotic murderer known as Nightslasher he now must also protect a woman becoming witness by watching the killer very closely. Here that woman' s role is played by his ex-wife Bridget Nielsen. She also had been with him in Rocky 4 as playing Ivan drago' s wife. It contained very marvelous king of car chases and gun fights and suspense when she is being stalked and tried to be hunted by the serial killer. But above all it was Stallone who was the life of the movie. Just remember his quotes from the beginning till the end. Especially in the end ,"" You are history !!! and "" this is where the law stops and i start ,' sucker!!!!!"". But he also encounters some problems too when some of his fellow officers confront him for doing things his own way , as perhaps they were little jealous of him and with one he had very serious disagreements. I even was also impressed by the villain Bryan Thompson , he was quite handsome and in good shape , even he could had played an action hero. Well he met very brutal end by the two heavyweight giants of Hollywood, in Cobra by Sylvester Stallone and in Terminator by the hands of Arnold Schwarzenneger.

But they seem to love motorbikes, leather studded clothes and senseless violence. This is the extent of their amazing plan.Stallone plays Cobra, a maverick killer who the cops call when they don't wanna get their hands dirty. He has a gun engraved with a snake, and it seems to grant him the incredible ability of never missing a shot. His real first name is 'Marian', which elicits of lot of amusement from the other characters but surely not the audience in today's gender-sensitive world(!)There's a meathead officer, who's only role is to disagree with Stallone at every turn and always be wrong. Not to worry, he gets punched in the face at the end. Hardy Ha Ha.Christmas is also on the way, so expect to see lots of cheap decorations, plastic Santas and other assorted tat in the background. To me, spotting them all on the derelict city streets was by far the most interesting thing in the movie.If you can wake up in time for the climax, there's a mildly diverting road chase into a boiling hot factory, where some of the most gory deaths in the movie occur. My favourite: A guy getting covered with a barrel of liquid methane, and Stallone very kindly offers him a light. You can guess what happens next.There's barely anything else in the movie, from Stallone's chemistry-free relationship with Brigette Nielsen, or in the cliched banter, that hasn't been done better before. In other words, this is a considerable waste of time.Over fifty minutes was apparently trimmed for theatrical release, and it shows.

150,Sharkey360,"Cobra is a treat for Stallone fans, action lovers and police story enthusiasts",5,17 January 2009,"We all remember how Sylvester Stallone arguably conquered the action genre in the 1980s. 1985 was a massively successful year for him as his movies Rocky IV and Rambo: First Blood Part II combined for over $600,000,000 in movie ticket sales worldwide.In 1986, his winning streak continued, albeit on a lower gear, with the release of Cobra, a production of the notorious Golan-Globus team.This film is a loose adaptation of the novel Fair Game. Stallone plays Marion ""Cobra"" Cobretti, a member of the Los Angeles Police Zombie Squad. As the film opens, viewer will witness the chaos crime brings to ordinary citizens.Yet something happens one night - a lady (Brigitte Nielsen) accidentally encounters the Night Slasher and escapes. This man, who earned his name from the media due to his killing of people in the night, turns out to be the head of a gang of psychopaths who feel that they are ""the future"" of civilization.The Night Slasher wants Nielsen killed, which causes her to go to the police and get protection from Cobra. Unknown to Cobra, the Night Slasher has a spy in the police.You just have to watch the film for more on the story.Technically, Cobra is obviously outdated by today's standards. True, its style of shooting action scenes and stunts were cool for 1986 but they all aged poorly. The story, which was toned down and involved Stallone, is pretty simple. Don't expect major plot twists or deep characterization here...Cobra is all about action and it is crafted to show that Stallone is very bankable with police-oriented action flicks.In some ways, this film is literally an attempt for Stallone to dethrone (or complement) Clint Eastwood's legacy in cop movies. Oh yeah, one of Stallone's co-stars here also worked with Eastwood.Considering that this was released in 1986, and that the same guy who directed Rambo: First Blood Part II called the shots here, some viewers might be surprised to find out that Stallone did not appear shirtless.Cobra was financially successful with a global box-office gross of $160 million (just $49 million in America). It was easily panned by critics but was accepted by moviegoers who simply wanted action and/or Stallone himself.Despite its overall weakness, Cobra is still somewhat fun to watch all thanks to Stallone. This movie is available on DVD and I can only recommend it to hardcore Stallone fans, nostalgic action fans and police story enthusiasts.On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 5.2 http://sharkey360.blogspot.com",Cobra

There is some good action scenes though, but they are spaced out from each other to give the audience a pretty good breather. However, these scenes between the action failed at giving the characters some character development.I was not sure if ""Gonzales"" (Santoni) was ""Cobretti's"" partner before ""Cobretti"" was called in to protect the witness or not. It was pretty obvious that they respected each other more than ""Cobretti"" respected others on the force who always confronted him on his ways in doing his job, especially one vocal one in particular. There was also very little character development with the villains, who the police believe is only one person due to one using a very distinct weapon to slash victims.One character that should have been developed more, not to mentioned had a bigger role than she did, was the mole. This character had the least amount of lines, and never interacted with the witness, ""Cobretti"" or ""Gonzales"" after being assigned to help protect the witness. I would have liked to have seen this character more developed, and attempting to steer the others away from her as a suspect when ""Cobretti"" figured out there is a mole in the department.The action scenes are pretty well done. With only two that are real graphic in comparison with the others. We get a good car chase, with gun play on the highway, the lead villain visiting the witness in the hospital with intent to kill her, and a final confrontation between the villain and ""Cobretti"" near the end of the film. That final scene between our hero and the villain is the only time the two have any interaction since the general public is unaware of ""Cobretti"" protecting the witness. I would have liked to have seen some scenes where they meet eye-to-eye, with the villain having a ""cat me if you can"" attitude before escaping.The acting is surprisingly good in this movie. Stallone portrayed his character as a jerk only when needed, and allowed his softer side to show. I liked the interaction between ""Cobretti"" and ""Gonzales"", who would tease each other as if they knew one another for awhile. The interaction between Stallone and Nielsen, who married some time after this film, was also good, but not great thanks to the script not being that great.I personally would have liked to have seen more of a love subplot between ""Cobretti"" and the witness. You didn't really seeing them glancing at each other until the two ended up in bed before the climatic final battle. I also would have liked to seen more from the villains and supporting cast that worked with ""Cobretti"" and ""Gonzales"".The motive for the killings are never investigated by ""Cobretti"" or ""Gonzales"". In fact, I don't think any of those involved in the investigation came up with a probable motive that was proved pretty much wrong by one of the lead characters as their investigation slowly lead them to the villains. It takes the lead villain's dialog in his final confrontation with ""Cobretti"" to explain their motive. Not once is the audience given even a hit as to the motive for the killings anywhere in the movie.One thing that sticks out is product placement. I have no problem with product placement, but they made it pretty obvious when you see the Coca-Cola and Pepsi logos all over the place, or when a character is drinking a beer or soda with the logo facing the camera. You even had ""Cobretti"" turning on a TV in his apartment just as a Toys 'R' Us Christmas commercial is starting as if the TV was programed to play it as the set switched on. Good product placement should make it less obvious than this movie made them. Heck, even products that were in the grocery store at the beginning of the movie happened to fall to the floor with logos facing the camera.Another thing that is seen a lot of is the cliché of the hero spouting one-liners. Stallone had some good one-liners through the entire movie, but none have gone down as memorable lines in movie history.With some good performances from the main cast, this movie is pretty watchable. I would not put it on your Must See List though. If you like good action films, this one should go on your To See List, but don't put it high on your list considering action scenes are spaced out a bit too much if you ask me. The movie gave too much of a breather for the audience between action scenes in my opinion.I would have to give this movie a B-minus overall. Catch it on TV, or the On Demand section of your local cable company. I personally watched it on my cable company's website, which has movies and TV shows much like Hulu does.",Cobra
152,zofos,Unfairly Overlooked Action Movie,6,4 June 2008,"This movie has probably had the harshest criticism of any action movie I can remember. It is rarely shown on television and Stallone hardly ever talks about it. All of Stallone's other movies have been released on DVD again and again every year, Cobra has been released maybe once or twice. I wonder why, as I've seen a lot, lot worse than this.Stallone had just had his biggest year ever at the box office in 1985 with the one-two punch of ""Rambo: First Blood Part II"" and ""Rocky IV."" The late George P. Cosmatos, director of ""Rambo II"", also directed this film and there were high hopes for it. However, it was a critical and box office failure. I don't know why, it's far superior to most other action movies from 1986.Stallone wrote the script for ""Cobra."" It's allegedly based on a book by Paula Gosling, but I don't recognize anything from that book in this movie. I think Stallone just took the basic premise of a cop protecting a woman and going on the run with her. The serial killer aspect is entirely Stallone's and doesn't feature in the book.The main problem with the film is that it apes ""Dirty Harry"" too much from its rule-bending cop on the trail of a vicious killer, right down to casting Andy Robinson and Reni Santoni from Eastwood's movie in it. It's even made by the same studio - Warner Brothers. Having said that, ""Cobra"" is better than most of the ""Dirty Harry"" sequels (It's certainly better than ""The Enforcer"" and ""The Dead Pool."") It also has the coolest poster of any of Stallone's movies (Stallone looks like he's auditioning for Arnold's role in ""The Terminator"" on the DVD cover!) Perhaps one reason people don't like this film is that they take exception to the casting of Stallone's then-wife, Brigitte Nielsen as the heroine.There are also some laughable ""tough guy"" moments (delivered seriously) like when Stallone rips a guy's vest and tells him he's bad for his health. Perhaps Stallone was believing his own press at that stage and he was getting too big for his boots after dominating the box office the year before.The photography by Ric Waite is excellent if a little too MTV. The score by Sylvester Levay is also good, you wonder why he never did more movie music.If you like Stallone and you like action movies, you'll like this. It's a perfectly agreeable time-waster.",Cobra

It's a cult wot's doing it, it transpires, but exactly why, it never does. Call in 'Marion' Cobretti, 'Cobra' to you. Stallone's fascist ways are anathema to his superiors, but he's the only man who can save the city ... and he does, of course, although he's so dumb he doesn't even take his gloves off to eat pizza. Stallone's death count must get into the hundreds here, with our hero suffering ne'er a scratch in the process. The deaths become increasingly violent until the last, predictably gruesome one in an iron foundry (you can possibly guess how he goes). Brigitte Nielsen's there to show a bit of leg and bulging blouse, and there's an hispanic sidekick (à la 'Dirty Harry') who's a complete waste of space. If we were to be kind, we could say that Stallone had done better things. But what the heck, let's come clean and say it - this is utter bilge from start to finish.",Cobra

And you will be left in a state of awe at what the 80s audience would buy from an action hero. And you will wonder how he survives those car chases, has no accountability, is a perfect shot, has that sixth sense of an assassin and above all, just how big of an issue crime was back then, when consider a criminally homicidal gang that kills people in a major city with such frequency and rapidity that today Seal Team 6 would be deployed on their ass, came across as acceptable to the script writers and audience back then.

See, I was workin' as a security guard at the time, and the theatre management thought people would use it as an excuse to get rowdy.

157,j30bell,Take it out back and shoot it,1,2 February 2005,"Every now and then I get an urge: I don't like to talk too much about it, but there it is, lurking this urge. I can't tell my girlfriend, and once I've satisfied the urge, well, naturally, I feel quite disgusted with myself. You understand, though, I can't help it I should explain. Mostly the urge involves turning down the lights, flicking on the TV and baying snobbishly and unpleasantly for 90minutes at films like Cobra. So far, I haven't found a support group for this compulsion, but I'm looking into it.So I suppose in some ways I should feel grateful to Cobra because if films like this didn't exist, I should be forced to watch Star Wars again. And while this would undoubtedly sate my feelings of smug superiority, it would nonetheless be masochism, and I have enough of a problem with my urge as it is.I suppose I should feel grateful, but part of the problem with my condition is that I can't. Cobra has to be one of the worst films ever made. If the illegitimate child of Miami Vice and Dirty Harry mated violently with the less poetically inclined twin of the Death Wish brothers it might bear nagging resemblance to Cobra. Cobra is living proof that, were it possible to surgically remove the 1980s from the sphere of human history (thereby losing my childhood, Gandhi, Bladerunner and Live Aid) it would be a price worth paying.Both dialogue and delivery make the fromage of Bruce Willis positively Shakespearian in comparison. Take the following line as a sample: ""Hey dirt bag, you wasted that kid for nothing. Now I think it's time to waste you!"" or perhaps the following (Killer)""The court is civilized, isn't it pig?"" (Sly) ""But I'm not. This is where the law stops and I start - sucker!"" Sly got a screen writing ""credit"" for this film, by the way. I mean, Rocky isn't exactly Hamlet, but what a comedown. It's incredible to think that two scant years later Die Hard was in the cinemas.What is more extraordinary about Cobra is that the performances, camera-work and score are more lame than the script.Anyway, unless you suffer from a similar compulsion to mine, avoid this film. It shares the credit with Commando for being the sphincter of 1980s cinema  and boy  as mister 'cott would say - that's saying summut. 1/10",Cobra

You know not to take the movie too seriously, just try to have some fun with it. Regardless of the fact that it's a copycat of ""Dirty Harry"" (which is one of my all time favorite movies), and has some one liners that you want to roll your eyes at, I still like ""Cobra."" My rating: 7/10",Cobra
163,grenmonkey,the 80's back!,5,18 October 2009,"I had some expectations for Cobra (1986) because the poster of Sylvester Stallone as Lieutenant Marion ""Cobra"" Cobretti is some sort of an icon in popular culture: I thought I'd be seeing a great 80's action rampage, with loads of bad one-liners, a cheesy sex scene with the ""hero and the woman in trouble"", stereotypical bad guys and so forth. Indeed I got most of those but there wasn't anything so great about it.The film's about Cobra (Stallone), who tries to track down a serial killer called ""Night Slasher"" while trying to protect a witness (Brigitte Nielsen) that could help him solve the case; Cobra's answer for both of those problems is shooting everything in sight, throwing a bad one-liner in after and pausing for a moment to let the audience laugh for the line in peace. But usually there's nothing to be laughed about other than the movie itself.The plot is thin and there's very little if any character development in it, but I don't think anyone even expects a decent script or versatile characters from an 80's action thriller starring Sylvester Stallone. Sly does OK job with the character of his and he does look cool with his tight jeans, long coats and aviator sunglasses, not forgetting the matches he constantly chews... but I wouldn't be praising him for his performance. Rest of the cast is also OK, though some of them dangerously balance on the (broad) line between serious and laughable – the often ridiculous dialog does not help the case.The action is also OK but I expected there to be more of it. The action that is just about to get interesting is often interrupted with more mellow or thrilling scenes in which the film doesn't shine at all – the pacing is off.Cobra is a decent film that still rides on with it's cool 80' feel. The film experience for me was more about the curious examples of what was considered cool in the decade that I was born, not so much about the action or story themselves. 2/4",Cobra
164,michaeljhuman,Excellent 80s action movie,8,26 April 2014,"I give this an 8/10. Now, that seems like too much for this movie. I rate movies in their context. This is very well executed movie in the 80s action movie genre hence the 8/10.It's a stupid plot. So is the plot for most 80s action movies. So what does it have going for it?First off, Stallone is part Harry Calahan, part Rambo, part whatever that character is played by Arnold in Commando. He has the one liners and the attitude. He's funny. He's charismatic.I like the leading lady. She has little personality, but is very cute. She's a damsel in distress, she hardly needs much for personality.And we get the obligatory music video. You may only appreciate this if you lived in that time and place, but it's nostalgic for me.Then we get a bunch of amusing psychos. One is completely over the top. I can't think of many psychos I like better. He's as amusing as the psycho from the movie the Warriors. In fact, he should have stolen the line 'I just like to do crazy things like that.'Then there's Stallone's hotrod. That is a very cool ride, and I think most hot rod lovers would watch the movie just for the car.This is the dark future of some crazy new world order gang, except they are so stupid and obvious they are hardly the threat they are portrayed. But I LOVE the scene with them in their lair with their ""weapons"" banging in time. Almost poetic.You should only watch this for the ""so bad it's good"", ""total cookie cutter 80s' action movie"" vibes. I would guess 20somethings and many 30somethings won't see the charm. But I do.

So the movie, and the character, kind of defined my teenage years. Interestingly, I only watched the movie recently, at forty one, even though I had purchased the soundtrack back in 1987, and the songs/music still have the power to emotionally transport me to that good old era and time. Stallone plays the role of an ultra-macho, match stick chewing hard hitting cop with aplomb, and has the face and jawline of youth to carry off that role with panache. The action is hackneyed, but the Uzi with the laser scope fitted has since become an icon. Brigitte Nielsen does not have much of a role, other than playing the stereotypical blonde in distress with Stallone as her savior. Plenty of gunfights, car chases, one line wisecracks and macho posturing. In other words, there is not a single thing that is not enjoyable and entertaining enough for an 80s movie buff.

One is how well it correlates to Paula Gosling's ""Fair Game"" (the crime novel on which it's based). Also, the memorable lines like ""you're a disease and I'm the cure"". And finally, the fact that Stallone introduces us to a new character besides Rocky and Rambo. Although the plot line is not terribly original, the action scenes are well done and believe it or not, Brigette Nielsen actually turns in a very good performance.

Kind of like that first time you accidentally stepped in a big pile of dog crap.Stallone plays the absurdly named title character, ""Marion Cobretti"", who is responding to a hostage standoff in a supermarket when the movie opens. The first 15 minutes of this pathetic excuse for an action film must hold some sort of record for having the most product placements in movie history. From Coors Beer to 7up. This rapid fire montage of continuous product placement eventually culminates with Cobretti returning home after the unexciting opening sequence. There, he cuts off a sliver of Pizza Hut pizza as he sits down in front of a TV, where he proceeds to watch an entire commercial for Toys-R-Us.The remainder of this wretched movie plays like a cross between a bad 80's MTV music video and an even worse Dirty Harry ripoff. Stallone casts as his love interest his then-wife Brigette Nielsen, who would soon divorce him and take him to the cleaners. The villains have zero dimension and are basically nothing more than props for Stallone to spray bullets at.As with most other Stallone action films, there is never any sense of excitement or danger because you know that no bullet will ever come close to nicking him, and no bad guy will ever be a worthy match in a street fight.Just like in any number of his ""original"" screenplays, Stallone the writer comes up with one outrageously corny line of dialogue for his character to mutter. The entire movie revolves around this moment, which coincidentally happened to be the tag line: ""Crime is a disease and I'm the cure"".All the clichés are here: renegade cop who plays by his own rules, inability to obey orders from his superiors, yet idolized by his fellow officers on the force. Cobretti's blow-dried hairdo is forever perfectly moussed and will never get disheveled amidst all the mayhem and chaos as he wipes out the mysterious gang of thugs after his love interest. Forget about action, Cobra plays more like a comedy without laughs.Horrible movies are the disease. Stallone retiring from acting and film-making is the cure.",Cobra

YET his role is also that of Michael Biehns Kyle Reese. He must protect a young woman from an unknown force of even more ruthless killers.(Replace futuristic cyborgs with unfeeling cult murderers. Not that different from the murderous AI, right?)Even the car chases, settings for the final showdown and cheesy one liners are staright out of Terminators playbook. The desperation of Cobretti being the only man capable of protecting a loan, oblivious woman reeks of Kyle Reeses plight!If you loved the first two Terminators, then this movie is as close as you can get.Watch Cobra with these thoughts in mind and tell me I'm wrong!It's gritty, violent, horrifying, and overall, good old fashioned fun",Cobra
173,DamianThorn,Stallone in an action classic that grabs you from the start and refuses to let go.,10,11 June 2014,"This is a true action movie. I feel no hesitation in stating that and no hesitation in watching this movie as such. It's solely about a Dirty Harry style police officer known as ""The Cobra"". He works on what's called the Zombie Squad and when the regular cops can't get the job done, they call the Cobra.When a cult like gang of serial killers begins targeting random civilians in an attempt to bring about anarchy, Cobra is set on the case. One witness, a fashion model played by the gorgeous Bridgette Nielsen is the only witness to one of the gangs murders and they are bent on hunting her down and slaughtering her. Only Cobra stands between her and certain death.Good god this movie is fantastic to watch. Stallone once again shines in the lead role kicking ass and not bothering to take names. He deals with your typical thugs at times and faces down a whining sniveling by the book cop who despises Cobra's tactics. That whining cop is played fantastically well by Hollywood veteran Andrew Robinson of Hellraiser and Dirty Harry fame. At its core though, this film is about the battle between Cobra and the gang of psychopaths. The film rarely strays from that and appropriately so.As for the rest of the cast, they all do a wonderful job in their roles. Bridgette Nielsen is jaw dropping and this is one of those movies that I love to refer to as a ""perfect storm"". On the surface, it should be a mediocre film that probably wouldn't work at all. But because of the cast, because of the story writing and direction, because of the cinematography and even because of the era in which it was made this film simply instantly became a classic.One final note about the cast. If you've watched enough in the way of movies and television, especially from the eighties and nineties you will instantly recognize Brian Thompson. Thompson plays a character here known as the ""night slasher"". A ruthless psychotic who enjoys murder more than he enjoys breathing. Thompson is fantastic in these types of roles and it's almost as if he was born for them.If your an action fan you will love this movie. There are plenty of high speed chases, gun battles and insanely intense moments. Nielsen and Stallone work fantastically well together and Stallone plays Cobra to perfection.

He wanted it to be a ""Stallone Film(tm)"". Thank the stars that those in charge dumped Sly and retooled ""Cop"" for Eddie Murphy. ""Cobra"", as the story has it, is Stallone's idea of what ""Beverly Hills Cop"" should have been.There are always people who will say ""oh, just because it's a brainless action flick doesn't mean it's bad."" That's okay for a small budget production like ""Death Race 2000"" (which also features Stallone). ""Cobra"", on the other hand, is a big budget movie with a 2 dollar script and 50 cents worth of direction. It's hard to believe that this is essentially the same guy who wrote ""Rocky"".This movie is more than stupid; it actually reaches out from the screen and transfers some of its stupidity right into your head. You walk away with a feeling of being dumber for having watched it - especially if you paid to see it.Stallone acts horribly. The script makes no sense - any episode of ""Starsky & Hutch"" seems like Hemingway by comparison.

179,Cobretti_1986,80's entertainment at it's best,10,17 June 2003,"First of all....to all the people who bash this film, I have one question for you. Did you see the cover? If after seeing the cover, Stallone with sunglasses an Uzi in his hand and a match in his mouth, and you still rented this and hated it you deserve what you get. If you want to watch ""Masterpiece Theater"" and pretend not to be bored then go ahead. Leave action movies for the fans of the genre.This movie doesn't pretend to be anything that it's not. It's a violent, campy, 80's Stallone vehicle that is a lot of fun. Cobra is a cool character with catchy one liners and an awesome 50 Merc Coup. He wears sunglasses and a match in his mouth. A rouge cop who works the zombie squad and is a lonely guy until he meets an aspiring model who he's been hired to protect. If you dont like Stallone then this film will not change you're mind.
4 **** starsPs. The movie is an editing masterpiece. Edited by Don Zimmerman who edited ""Being There""",Cobra
180,tp320,One of my favorite movies,10,4 March 1999,"Let me start by saying that I fully understand all the people who hate this film. After all, it is a violent, often extremely stupid macho-actioner which falls apart if you start to think it's contents for a second. Its characters are one-dimensional and there's really not much plot or dialogue. But while many others think of the above as a bad thing, I think I've just described the recipe for a perfect action film.I recently watched ""Vampires"" on DVD and listened to John Carpenter's commentary and one comment amused me. When James Woods and his crew were outside a building supposedly filled with vampires, everyone was wearing vests and neckpieces which protected them from being bitten except James Woods and Carpenter said about this something like ""You can see how everyone is wearing vests except James Woods because he's so tough"". Such is the case with Cobra also. All the other cops are dressed like...well, cops, but Stallone, he really stands out from the crowd in a positive way with his tight jeans, T-shirts, a pair of really cool (and very 80s) sunglasses and a match in his mouth (which I thought was a very nice touch). And why does he look like this? You guessed it - because he's so tough.As I said before, there's not much plot and what there is, is pretty stupid and generic. We have seen it many times before and we will (I hope!) see it many times in the future but hey, if it ain't broken, why fix it? Of course there are several people who think it has always been broken.. There are some sequences and dialogue in Cobra which are almost embarrassingly stupid such as the opening shot where the team of killers are weaving axes to the air and then there are the legendary lines ""The court is civilized, isn't it...pig?"" ""But I'm not.. This is where the law stops..and I start..sucker!"" but I'm just so glad that they included these scenes (even though they probably knew that the critics wouldn't like them) because they are my favorite scenes in the movie.This is a movie which has a very, very specific target audience and the reason for all the bad reviews is probably the fact that unlike other movies like this, this was for some reason targeted to a wider audience and of course, many people didn't like it. Not because Cobra is a bad movie but because they just don't like films like this. Surprisingly the other movie which was also based on Paula Gosling's novel, the William Baldwin-Cindy Crawford -actioner ""Fair Game"" suffered the same fate. Needless to say, I also liked that film a lot.I know most people don't like the movies that I like and that's OK but I want others to know that I personally have seen probably over a thousand action movies and this is one of my all-time favorites and that there are many, many others who have truly enjoyed Cobra and it has become a cult classic to action fans worldwide. And when everyone starts to really think about it, Cobra may just be the perfect movie. There are so many films made in the 90s which are OK. They are not great but they don't suck either. Cobra, however, has all the ingredients that action fans love and others hate. It doesn't leave anyone cold, you either love it or you hate it. But I'll say this: If you like films like ""Schindler's List"" or ""Shakespeare in Love"" and you rent a film with a tagline ""Crime is a disease. Meet the cure. COBRA"", you truly deserve what you see!Cobra is an excellent action movie because of a great macho performance (I loved the deep voice!) and screenplay from Stallone, a truly phenomenal score from my favorite composer Sylvester Levay, tight editing by Don Zimmerman and good cinematography by Ric Waite (who was also the director of photography in my other favorite, ""Marked for Death"" starring Steven Seagal). I also praise the director, George P. Cosmatos, although I haven't liked his other movies as much as this.Anyway, the name and the tagline really says it all. You're either going to love or hate this and all I can say is, if you look for any intelligence in a movie, don't see it. I do, but not in an action movie. Actually, I don't even want action films to be smart or sophisticated. For me, Cobra delivers! I give it a full 10/10.",Cobra
181,Lovechild_77,Underrated cult actioner with our all favourite Sly in good form!,7,4 January 2006,"I get confused when I see that this cool movie has a score under 5. Are those peoples who kill the average score jealous or just not real action fans? If you don't like real macho action movies then don't see them. It's simple as that! I forced myself to see this movie although its bad reputation, because I like Sylvester Stallone really much, and I was positively surprised I must say. First of all, the picture itself. Really nice! Nice colours, not too dark, not sloppy edited, not too fast paced. Perfekt! The story is so so, but Sly is really cool and the villains looks quite nasty too, so you just want them to die and you know that Sly will get them. And Brigitte Nielsen looks astounding too! :)So, if you are a great fan of real macho action movies with a nice 80s touch, like Sly and movies like Rambo and most of Seagal's efforts, then don't hesitate with this one. It's a winner.It's also perfectly edited, it doesn't feel too short or too long, there are no dead periods in the movie, everything just runs along in a perfect pace. And this is although the movie isn't longer than 80 min.Recommended!",Cobra
182,THEPIPEMAN64,80's Stallone,8,3 May 2003,This is by far one of Stallone's greatest actions movies.  If you love the 80's action cinema were the good guys rarely get hurt and they act so cool its funny you will love this movie.  It is on the top 10 of the best action movies to ever come out of the 80's.  I will admit that it is as cheesy as all get out but arent most good action movies cheesy.  Plus it is directed by George P. Cosmatos the same person who directed Rambo II and Tombstone. The movie is pretty dark and pretty violent plus the other cool part about it is the car Stallone drives and that his boss is the killer in Dirty Harry.  So trust me if your an action junkie this is the movie for you.,Cobra
183,moviefan-85,Underrated Stallone flick!,8,2 March 2004,"I dont understand why everybody are trashin this movie. This is pretty good movie. Atleast the movie is entertaining. The story is: Some crazy killing gang kills young pretty female. One woman becomes witness and so Sly must be the hero and save her. Its pretty funny because in the movie there is a line: ""I dont want to be a hero I just want to be involved"" We all know that star of this movie is Stallone. The leader of the gang is Brian Thompson who you might know from X files series and Van Dammes Lionheart.The director George P Cosmatos (Rambo 2). Brigitte Nielsen who plays the victim that that Cobra must protect is awful. The movie was nominated several Razzie awards when it came out. Few people actually like it. Im not very big sly fan but still i enjoy this movie wherever I see it. Trust me it is entertaining! Any Cobra fans, just write me!",Cobra
184,DragStrip,Great fun for Old School Action Fans,8,13 October 2007,"Stallone released Cobra the year after he ruled the box office with a second Rambo and a forth Rocky. Although the film was reasonably successful at the Box Office, it was much maligned by critics, as it has often been since. But in the years since its release, many people, including some who weren't even born when this film came out, have developed a fondness for this kind of action film, where the heroes were tougher, the plots simpler, editing more restrained and ratings higher. Such people will likely have a blast with this film. The action scenes are exciting and masterfully edited. The one liners are memorable and often downright bizarre. Although it's difficult to call this film ""gritty"" it has a wonderfully moody/Gothic atmosphere at times, and the cinematography, particularly in the opening scene is some of the best I have ever seen in an action film. The film does have a somewhat Right-Wing stance on crime and the legal system, but I think it would be a bit silly to get too worked up about what a film in which the villains are a cult who bang axes together has to say about society.So if you're an old school action fan, don't listen to critics when deciding whether to watch ""Cobra""; play by your own rules. Why? Because it gets results, damn it!",Cobra
185,lorenzoadd,"Mediocre, eye-candy action movie with Stallone in his prime",5,18 July 2020,"This is definitely not Terminator.If I had seen this in the late 80s, early 90s, I would've probably given it a 7,8 stars. But, I've seen it in 2020, so it gets an indulgent 5*
Stallone probably looks the best he ever had: trendy haircut, fit, muscle t-shirt, ass-tight jeans. And we have Brigitte Nielsen doing a photo-shoot for 3-4 minutes in some of the most iconic and provocative skimpy outfits of that time.However, the screenplay is mediocre, so is the directing and the sound mixing is pretty bad. Gruesome serial murders on pop songs that are repeating throughout the movie.

I loved it from start to finish with the highly notable first scene being the stand out centrepiece. Everything that is good about the male action hero is summed up this 20-minute bloodbath, little care is taken to dialogue and the one liner is king. From the moment when Stallone gives his crime wave countdown monologue you know this is a no thinking required action fest with plenty of violence to boot. However, watching this film is at times like one of the police chase shows. You know its simple chaos but you just can't take your eyes off it. Please watch this film...but leave your brain at home.",Cobra
187,JaniceBackFromTheDead,Cobra still bites,6,31 January 2005,"One of my all time favorite go-bad-it's-good flicks; Stallone action vehicle COBRA (1986). Well, one man's action-packed thrill ride movie is another man's giggle-fest, I suppose. And I am that giggler. There is just so much to laugh at here.Stallone at his mumbliest: ""You're da disease.... and I'm da cure.""He's a cop who drives his own custom chop-shop hot rod on the job. OK, he's undercover. Still... do a lot of cops do that? I bet he parks it next to the little trailer on the beach that Mel Gibson lives in, in LETHAL WEAPON. You know; because he's so poor all he can afford is LA beach front to park his trailer at. But I digress...Back to COBRA. The bad guys are this huge cult of axe-wielding, drug addicted, bulked-up, profusely sweating, *chanting* psychos with a maniac stare. A whole raft of them, each so choked with crime-loving, law-hating rage 24/7 that it's all they can do to spit cop hating sentences out from between their clenched teeth. If I saw just one guy like this in a movie, I would probably get a chuckle. But THE WHOLE GANG IS LIKE THAT. Excuse me, did anyone happen to see my suspense of disbelief around here? I seem to have lost it. I must have dropped it when I was laughing.This same bunch of uber-bad guys are always several steps ahead of the cops (except for Cobra, natch). OK, they have a spy in the police feeding them info. Even so, this bunch of barely cognizant, drug maniac psychos (see above paragraph) have a covert spy and command network that surpasses anything LAPD can manage. They pull off operations that would put the Impossible Missions Force to shame. Yet they can cannot so much speak, as growl. They find time to do all this in between lengthy sessions of lovingly slow knife sharpening work, and crazed group chanting about the joy of doing crime. Amazing.A fun perk; we get to watch Stallone crank up a screen romance with on-other than ex-wifey-poo-to-be Brigitte Nielsen. Which with hindsight, we can appreciate as a symbolically bad move, what with Sly and Brigitte destined for a well publicized real-life divorce a year>or so latter. When the kissy scenes start, join me in my worse Burgess Meredith, cigar-chomping impersonation; ""DON'T DO KID! SHE'S POISON! SHE'LL BREAK YER HEAAAAART!"" Oh, the tragic irony.So anyway, one crime leads to another, people get killed, Cobra gets lectured by his gruff boss about following procedure, delivers rants about the uselessness of the court system and extols the virtues of vigilante-cop justice, yada yada. It's been a while and I'm embarrassed to say that I don't actually remember if we get to hear his boss bark the hallowed demand; ""Your gun and your badge!"" Maybe Cobra just tosses his badge without waiting to be asked, I forget. Shoot, I can't remember if there was any badge tossing going on at all. It's merged into a blur with all the other maverick cop flicks.Things wind up with Brigitte and Sly hiding out in farm country, but soon chased on foot through an orange grove. In the middle of, and let me emphasize, the ORANGE GROVE, is a old corrugated-metal building. So... in the middle of farm country, in the middle of an orange grove, the pair are pursued into the old metal building, inside of which is... No, it's not a orange crating warehouse! What were you thinking? It's a deserted factory with huge furnaces and foundry-like thingys! Sheesh, weren't you paying attention? I said it was in a orange grove; so of course it's a foundry. Orange warehouse, yeah right...A baddie shoots the lone security guard and a few stray bullets hit a control panel, naturally firing up the entire shebang to full>throttle. Oh, and what a factory it is! Flames spew into the isles from every piece of machinery such that you can barely turn around without risk of incineration. Automated hooks traverse the hellish place, unencumbered by guard rails or safety devices. It's the factory that OSHA forgot! Well, THAT'S WHY THEY PUT IT IN AN ORANGE GROVE! Who's gonna look for a foundry there? What product do they make in this orange grove factory? We see no sign of it. I'm thinking; orange juicers?The final glorious battle and mini-debate between good and evil transpires. The biggest baddest of the uber-thugs literally spits out his contempt for the law, and is duly met by Cobra's mumble finale. Cobra is victorious of course in this the ultimate battle of the speech impaired. Cobra sees to it that the spit-hulk's arguments go right up in flames, so to speak. Cobra makes amends with his LAPD bureaucratic nemesis by punching him to the ground, and all is well. As the aroma of barbecued maniac fills the air, Sly rides off happily with... Brigitte?!!! ""Noooooooo! Kid, I'm begging' ya! SHE'S POISON I TELLS YA! POISON!""I laugh out loud every time I see this movie. It's a masterpiece of action/maverick-cop cliché.",Cobra

Yes that isn't a typo. I gave Cobra a nine out of ten. Why? Because Cobra is one of those few movies that you could watch again and again and never tire of it. It is without question the funniest non-comedy ever made. Sure you have your low budget Z-graders like Plan 9 and Manos, but they were shot on a shoestring budget with no talent hacks making them. This was a major studio picture with a huge budget. In 1986 when this film was released Sly was the most bankable movie star in the world just coming off of two mega hits Rocky 4 and Rambo 2. Did you know he dropped out of starring in Beverly Hills Cop to make this film. I hope Eddie Murphy still sends him a Christmas card every year. This movie is great for all the wrong reasons. Bad lines, outrageous action sequences, cheesy music, but I love it. Just for kicks next time you watch it count the number of bikers Cobra kills in the chase while he is standing in the bed of the pick-up truck. I can't remember the exact number off of the top of my head, but I can tell you that it is definitely over 40!!!

The movie stars Stallone in a Dirty Harry type role who's name is Marion Cobretti as he battles the streets of L.a. The movie is an underrated action flick with a good story, and awesome action. The movie was the original script for Beverly Hill's Cop, but was too violent for a comedy, not only that but it also drew inspiration from the Clint Eastwood series Dirty Harry with an iconic gun and some cast members in both movies. I personally think that Stallone is treated unfairly especially the dick suckers at Razzie and this movie shows. If you get a chance, watch the movie because it is a good movie as I said and one more thing that is a highlight, Rambo fights Shao Kahn.",Cobra

Is the message this movie screams. 'Authority is wrong, Vigilantism is right.' Is another message (it screams). I suppose Cobra is a Sherlock like figure - anti-social, solving crime, called in by the police when a situation is beyond their control, loyal sidekick with whom he rallies back and forth some truly shite banter ('you should eat fruit.' 'I don't like fruit.' 'Eat some fruit.' 'I don't want to eat fruit.' 'some grapes or something' Jesus, you get the idea). Yeah, Cobra is essentially Sherlock, only he substitutes brain for brawn, charisma for brawn, and likability for brawn.From the weak plot line, sexy supporting actress, random robot shots, over-the-top car chases, unanswered questions at the end - this film vomits eighties clichés like a drunk girl vomits kebab at three o'clock in the morning.And yet. And yet. I can honestly say this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Sylvester Stallone once said something like: 'If you want somebody to confess to murder, just put them in a room with one of my old movies. They'll confess to anything within five minutes.' Well Stallone's self-deprecation may be affable, but it is wrong. You could put me in a room for ten years with this on repeat, and I would not confess to stealing a stick of gum - for 'Cobra' is quite frankly, cinematic gold.

I'd give it six stars alone for the car chase where Stallone's driving backwards at God knows what speed and firing a fully automatic machine gun out his window at the bad guys and does it so skillfully you'd think he's never driven a car forward in his life. Cobra has an 80s slasher horror thing going on as well that was taken straight from the headlines at the time. Not long before the movie released the ""Night Stalker,"" Richard Ramirez, terrified L.A. until his ultimate capture. In Cobra, the main villain is--a long stretch--the ""Night Slasher.""

Stallone plays a Dirty Harry-esque tough cop who talks in punches and one liners. His job is to safeguard a woman who was privy to a murder against a bunch of axe wielding maniacs- who happen to be the unnamed bad guys.

This is the main fault of the movie, plus the bad guys are implausible (you never understand their motives, this is a very poor comprehension of the criminal mind, an ideologically misguided view of it as an innate -non social- psychopathy). On the other hand, this film bears a message which is too transparent to be effective (not to speak of its primitiveness). Stallone keeps repeating throughout the movie things like ""Hell, without human rights and rules to follow, my job would be much easier"". The thing is that he repeats it over and over, so it becomes annoying, it's like right-wing propaganda for dummies (other movies are right-wing propaganda for not-so-dummies), and on top of that, the obligatory pretty-girl-to-rescue says ""Yeah, you're right, i can't believe what the judges do!"" etc etc (like US hadn't the largest population of inmates by far).

The story follows a series of murders that some believe are connected to one person, however we all know better. A model is witness to a brutal killing by the New World Order and now it is up to Cobra to serve and protect her. This movie has a great soundtrack as well and the writing by Stallone is solid, filling the film with witty one-liners and comebacks and even the subtle references to social commentaries and so forth.

203,stephenclark1,Cobragenre killer,1,30 September 2007,"Sylvester Stallone's Cobra (1986) is a delicious example of how a second-rate effort can illuminate a genre. Reportedly, Stallone had walked away from the lead in Beverly Hills Cop (1984) when differences arose regarding his input for the script. Many of his ideas were subsequently transplanted into the script for Cobra (much to Eddie Murphy's benefit).Cobra provides a point-for-point demonstration of the mechanics of the ?action cop film. The movie starts big, introducing our hero via dramatic shoot-out in a grocery store only tangentially related to the rest of the movie. It is a unintentionally comic sequence, indebted to Eastwood's Harry Callahan, who first nailed he ""urban western"" that is the action movie. Except the derivative nature of the effort shows. Item after item that was intended to convey originality instead sounds a false tone. Stallone looks ridiculous posed behind mirrored over-sized Ray-Bans. He worries a cooking match in his mouth because, well, cigarettes are not cool. He sports a three day growth because, hey, it's the 80's. Next, the fetish handgun, again recalling Harry's .44 Magnum, Sly sporting a ridiculous Colt .45 with ivory grips, a la Patton, a silly gun that would never be chosen by anyone actually serious about such things.Next comes the comic-relief partner, (played joylessly by Rene Santori, who did similar thankless work in the original Dirty Harry), and the hard-ass police captain with little patience for his rogue detective. ?The charismatic car, in this case, is Stallone's own 1950 Mercury coupe, which may be sort of neat in its own way, but looks absurd in the requisite chase scene. The ""cool"" bachelor pad is a converted warehouse in Venice Beach that just looks like space borrowed from the film lab that was processing the dailies, where Cobra lives on cold pizza he trims with scissors whilst keeping his lonely watch over the city in the smog. The female lead is a sadly dated Brigitte Nielsen, looking very 80's with big hair and skin-tight jeans, blessed with acting chops that are similarly stiff and tight. The bad guys are absurd, motive-less, frankly insane right-wing kooksusually a safe ""go-to"" choice when it comes to bad guys, from Magnum Force (1973) to Lethal Weapon 2 (1989). But here they just come off as relentlessly stupid.Of course, the depiction of traditional lines of authority as suspect, and of violence as a the chief instrument of morality is central to the movie and the genre. As with all other aspects of this movie, Cobra reveals the creaky stage machinery behind its derivative conceits. The climactic shoot-out/car chase is an illogical, patently ridiculous, gratuitous blood-letting that culminates in the villain being impaled on a hook and then burned alive, with our hero looking on with smug approval. It was a termination Himmler would have been proud of, and of which Cheney may still only dream.I could go on about the poor quality of the script, the indifferent cinematography, and the rancid acting, but suffice it to say that all are in keeping with the rest of the product. After watching Cobra, it is difficult to go back and watch a decent urban action film without becoming aware of the clank and creak of genre's formula.",Cobra
204,tdk007,Could this be Stallone's worst movie?,1,22 November 1998,"Somehow I missed ""Cobra"" when it first hit the theaters over 10 years ago. I finally caught up with it last night on cable and realized that I hadn't missed a thing.  This is even worse than ""Tango and Cash"".  Absolutely nothing makes sense in this brainless film.  Example:  After Stallone wastes two axe-carrying members of a death cult at his home, his superiors still say he is offering no proof that the killings are being done by a team rather than a single man.  At least there are a few members from the cast of ""Dirty Harry"" to remind us that a superior film can be made having the same theme.  Rent that instead of ""Cobra"".",Cobra

A lone wolf hero. A statuesque blonde heroine. A goofy sidekick. A spineless, petty law and order organization. A relentlessly cruel and mindless evil. Then when you factor in all the pluses: ""you're da disease and I'm da cure""; outright mayhem at a shopping center with the hero walking away doing a riff on being the thin blue line separating evil from good; the Pier Six brawl at police HQ between our hero and the epitome of bureaucratic evil. All of this and the patented Stallone style of emotionless mumbling with a 1000 yard stare while sucking on a toothpick. They just don't make them like this anymore.",Cobra

I think we need to have a Come-To-Jesus about this movie. I can't believe I actually saw such low approval stats from all age brackets. Lemme just holler and the children of the '80s: what the hell are you thinking? Stallone and Schwartzenegger were bigger than life back then, and there's no love.... Now there's nothing but CGI, bigger explosions, crazier guns, fake boobies, more authentic-looking aliens, all the things I like in movies -- wait a second.You know, I realize Stallone will never win Best Actor... I realize Stallone will never die, probably, he's always in such damn good shape... and I also realize that his face will never straighten up so he can talk correctly, but there's one thing I do know... I give this movie a 10, and I hope it feels like the giant peanut butter sandwich you just ate without a glass of milk anywhere in sight! I need a glass of rootbeer... BARTENDER!",Cobra
207,wayne_b43,Amazing movie that was hugely underrated!,8,5 August 2014,At first glance the movie seems like mindless action flick and Stallone just another empty headed action hero but upon a closer look you realize that he has deep feelings underneath the surface and that the movie tells a story about true justice and those who try to stand in its way.A story about the flaws of the justice system that sets criminals free and encourages crime(the night slasher is a direct product of flawed justice system) The soundtracks are awesome as well! In time this movie will earn its place among the classics when people finally come to an understanding about its TRUE quality!I recommend it to everyone!(except the faint hearted),Cobra
208,curley1970,Utterly dreadful 80's action flick!,1,8 April 2006,"I recently saw Cobra again, much to my misfortune!I had not seen it since it was originally released on VHS in the 80's, and it has not aged well, although it was very bad to begin with! It is so typical of macho shoot-em up movies of the era like the equally awful Schwarzenegger movie 'Commando'. I have never been a big Stallone fan, but Cobra is even by his standards very, very bad! Stallone stars as tough as nails cop 'Cobretti' or 'Cobra' as he is called in the movie. I don't want to go into a detailed description of the movies story, but I would not advise anyone with any taste to watch this dreadful film, it is so dated, the clothes, the hairstyles and those absolutely hideous Aviator shades stallone wears for most of the movie, whilst chewing on a match. The only good thing in the movie was his car, a customized 1949 Mercury which sadly he thrashes whilst trying to escape baddies. Anyway, this is one to avoid at all costs, if at all possible. I voted it one out of ten, only because I could not give it zero out of ten, which is what it deserved!",Cobra

Frank Cobretti a.k.a Cobra is one tough cop.  So tough that he can kill over 60 people by himself and never be disciplined.  Impressive.  And the one liners - You're the disease, and I'm the cure.  This film would be better if there were subtitles on the screen when Stallone talks.  I seriously couldn't understand what he was saying. The bad guys are so pathetic, they have the intelligence of ducks in a shooting gallery, which is pretty much how the action scenes play out. This movie is great if you like to mock (MSTie) movies with your friends. Otherwise, stay away from Cobra.  He's one tough cop.",Cobra

It is but it's also a movie that even Tarantino would be proud off.Stallone did a good job and he even wrote the screenplay.And Nielsen probably did her finest acting job ever in this movie.The supporting cast is also good, especially 'the night slasher'character. The movie opens very hard-boiled and very comparable with today's issues,even in the country where i'm from.Belgium that is.A clear case of snapping and to be part of something,like 'the way of the new world'. Lot's of cool violence,car chases,killings,shoot outs and off course Stallone. i think this is a rough mix of Dirty Harry meets John Woo meets Walter Hill movies. A violent comic book coming to life. If you like action/thrillers,SEE IT! If you like action/Thrillers and you didn't like it,you're no action movie fan,simple as that. If you don't like action movies,or Stallone,cause lot's of you don't(have you ever seen a movie with this guy actually?'Nighthawks','First Blood 1' cause that's the best,'Rocky series','Cliffhanger','Copland'???) anyway ,if you don't like action films,go and see The Notebook...",Cobra
213,jedi_knight900,80's Nostalgic Cinematic Experience,7,31 May 2009,"One of those rare gems that comes on TV in a blue moon and I had the opportunity of seeing it recently. The story itself is basic enough involving a ""tough-guy"" cop with no inhibitions and a style of justice that other vigilantes would be envious for. The film opens with a hostage situation at a local grocery mart and presents it's first opportunity with Sly to do his thing. Although the movie is quite derivative with other 80s cop/detective films, it still garners its identity as one of those nostalgic B movies we've come to love...especially when it comes to Sly. So do not expect great dialogue, although I must say I do have a guilty pleasure for those one-liners. The photography and some of the cinematography in the film are excellent and the final act is a great set of action to witness. Furthermore, I am a big fan of 80s music and it was marvelous to hear all those tunes played throughout the film.Note: The violence in the film is not gratuitous but be prepared for a high body count.Cobra rates a good 7/10.",Cobra
214,Cobra2003,"Where Rambo stops, Cobra Begins",7,15 September 2003,"With two Rambo movies, First Blood (1982) and Rambo : First Blood part II (1985) under his commando belt, Sylvester Stallone had confidently confirmed himself as the Box Office king of the Action Thriller genre. With all the gingoism and American flag waving that went with the comic strip adventures of the worlds favourite fictional viet nam vet, Stallone steps up a gear into Cobra (1986), one of the tightest, exciting, well written and under-rated action movies of the past few decades. Stallone takes British crime novelette Running Duck (US - Fair Game} from celebrated writer Paula Gossling and gives it the full Rambo gloss treatment. Gone from the novel is the alcoholic schizoid lead character and in his place is Marion Cobretti, the typical, four square Stallone character, and the story is all the better for this. Stallone' screenplay is pretty simple, and so is the under lying message that evil is a force that must be met on its own terms. So what we have is a violent actioneer chock full of punch ups, car chases and shooting. Sadly, the script isn't developed enough, and the Rocky elemnts so typical of Stallone's movies at this point, IE, the underdog hero who everyone is against, is used to the maxim here. Unlike the Rocky movies, the glare of humour isn't up to scratch, and so a great many of the lead characters are unlikeable. So what? Wasn't this the case with thrillers such as Seven or Resovoir Dogs? However, Rambo Director George Pan Cosmatos gives a fresh coat of paint to this particular movie, adding stylish touches of film noir to the action genre in a way that precceeds Face/Off (1997) and a whole host of successors. Bridgette Nielsen is the movies real surprise, giving a likeable and sincere performance as Helgar, under the watchful eye of her then Husband. What is really surprising is that Cosmatos manages to succesfully blend into the action genre touches of classic and contemporary horror movies such as Friday the Thirteenth and John Carpenters Halloween with the chilling depiction of the Night Slashers. The movie also contains some of the most exhilerating action and chase sequences, particularly in the movies climax, where Cobra lets rip unto the Night Slashers men. This is an under-rated gem, a very efficient Stallone/George Pan Cosmatos vehicle, and very possibly the best ever Menahem Golan, Yoram Globus/Cannon Film Group picture ever produced. .......................................................................8/10",Cobra

Its not the most tactful film to watch, but none the less i still enjoyed watching it and those classic 80's songs with the electronic drum machine still have a place in my heart.If your after a classic 80's action film which is slighty more gritty than the rest then watch this for sheer enjoyment.",Cobra

218,sherlintristan,"Extremely corny, extremely predictable, thoroughly undeniable fun!",10,29 December 2018,"This movie is all things said to be asked out of a Sylvester Stallone 1980's low-budget action flick. The movie rotates around probably the corniest cult to come to a big screen. This cult every now and again gathers in what seems to be an abandoned recreation center, and simultaneously clickes hatches together above their heads as some sort of freaky ritual before they commit murder, this is shown in the first 30 seconds of the film after an extremely corny voice over about American crime statistics voiced by Slyvester Stallone. At this point, you haven't even gotten in the first minute of the film and you already know you're in for a hell of a funny and action packed ride.
The director of the film worked previously on Rambo: First Blood Part II, so the actions sequences are helmed quite well, however, the writing is so laughably bad that you will love the movie for its seriousness on the matter. One small example will speak much about the writing of this film, Sylvester Stallone in the movie is nicknamed Cobra... yeah badass, but his full name is Marion Cobretti.... What in da f*#$! Who names a badass cop Marion, later in the movie there's and scene that specifically exploits how ridiculous this is! All in all, definitely worth the 90 plus minutes that it packs in, one of the best and worst action movies of the 80's, a must see classic of its time!",Cobra

So those of you who have not watched it please immediately and instantly watch, and those of you who've seen it, can watch again. and there is a bit of advice from me,Cobra is an excellent action movie because of a great macho performance (I loved the deep voice!) and screenplay from Stallone, a truly phenomenal score from my favorite composer Sylvester Levay, tight editing by Don Zimmerman and good cinematography by Ric Waite (who was also the director of photography in my other favorite, ""Marked for Death"" starring Steven Seagal). I also praise the director, George P. Cosmatos, although I haven't liked his other movies as much as this.Also by then, 1986, the soft-on-crime angle and cops who don't go by the rules to get the job done movies were already wearing thin with the American public. Tough on crime politicians and law enforcement personnel were being indited and jailed for being in many cases worse then the criminals that they were supposed to be fighting against.

This movie is soaked in over-the-top action, one-liners and everything you would expect from an 'R' rated 80's action movie. It's not perfect, but it does scratch that 80's action movie itch nicely. There are product placements in all their 80's glory. Psychopaths killing innocent people. A cult banging axes together in unison. A car chase through hilly streets. And Stallone, chewing on a match, hunting down bad guys with his laser scope automatic rifle. The first lines of the movie are Stallone reciting some inflated crime statistics in his creaky ""serious"" voice. Why there was never a Cobra 2, or 3, or 4 may remain an unsolved mystery.",Cobra

223,mrhagen_official,Non-intelligent entertainment,6,18 March 2019,"Basically the movie was made to make Sylvester Stallone wearing sunglasses, saying cool lines and taking down bad guys. That's all. And it's okay.Cobra is one of those 80s action movies that lives up to the genre. The ingredients are simple. The movie starts with a bad guy killing people in a supermarket. The scene was made for one thing: introducing the main character: Sylvester Stallone as Cobra.And yes. He is cool. Wearing a leather jacket, has great sunglasses, and has a Dirty Harry like attitude (don't know who has the baddest one).But as always there is something lurking on the background. A group of fanatics who want to create a 'New World' by wiping out the weak. Leaving a trail of murder.And there is a woman. A beautiful one. Standard ingredient. And there is an old factory with sparks, steam and hooks. You guess what happens with bad guys and hooks.And in the end the hero set outs with the girl on a bike to the horizon.Conclusion:
Cobra is what it is. An action movie purely made for entertainment where you don't have to think. No deep layers, no big story. It's overdone and everybody knows it. The producers, the director (did Rambo First Blood Part II) and Sylvester Stallone. And that is fine.

Now here is a film that may be a bit misunderstood, but it is an excellent movie that keeps you excited from the first minute until the last. Sure it has some predictable action sequences and dialog, but honestly the most important thing for me in an action film is not that it's totally unpredictable. We all know in action films, what's going to happen. Bad guy dies horribly, good guy gets girl, etc. What Cobra did is not unprecedented, but it's so much fun to watch. Great action, great villains, great sets. And as far as I can remember the first time a laser sight is used on a weapon in Hollywood. Back then it was unheard of, and Cobra's was as big as a house. This is before laser diodes, back when laser sights were actual LASERS. This thing probably didn't need a gun below, just shine it in the bad guys' eyes. Anyhow, excellent action film, wish they made more like this, where the good guy takes down 100 jerks just because he wants to help someone. Too many laws on PC film-making these days.",Cobra

There are some really great quotable lines that you will be repeating over and over. Like: ""This is where the law stops, and I start... Sucker!"" and ""Hey dirt bag, your a lousy shot. I don't like lousy shots. You wasted a kid, its nothing. Now I think its time to waste you."" and of course ""Your a disease, and Im the cure.""

It then wound up making circa $50m domestically and around $160m worldwide.

This time we brought my mother and grandmother to watch it.
