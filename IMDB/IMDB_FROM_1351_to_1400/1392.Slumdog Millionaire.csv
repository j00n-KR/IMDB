0,MartinHafer,Not quite up to all the hype and perhaps not for everyone...,9,25 November 2010,"With eight Oscar wins (including one for Best Picture), you can't help but assume this will be one of the best films ever made. Well, although it is very good, it's hard for ANY film to live up to this much hype I was a bit disappointed as a result.I began watching the film with my wife and oldest daughter, a short way into the film my wife left--saying the film was just too violent and depressing. Well, it IS both of these things and shows in awful detail what life can be like for the poor orphans of Mumbai. Vomiting, a kid jumping into a pool of excrement and evil thugs deliberately blinding kids--this movie WILL make you flinch and comes by the R-rating honestly. Now I am NOT suggesting they should have completely cleaned it all up--after all, this is a terrible sort of life and showing it any other way would be wrong. But, be forewarned--this is a very tough film to watch--especially in the first half hour.I would talk more about the film except it has already been reviewed 10000000000 times--and adding my two-cents worth isn't going to add much that hasn't already been written. Extremely well acted and constructed--this is a fine film.Perhaps the Oscar nominees that year were really bad. I dunno. All I do know is that this film probably has killed the Indian travel industry!!!",Slumdog Millionaire
1,TheLittleSongbird,"A very clever idea, constructed into a very interesting film.",9,27 July 2009,"Slumdog Millionaire was so much better than I expected, after reading mixed reviews in general. The very talented director Danny Boyle directs with a very sharp focus, that made the film as clever and engaging as it was. The film also allows an insight into the fully fleshed-out characters, that we do empathise with, and has very relevant themes presented throughout. The story for the film was a fantastic and very original one, and was beautifully constructed. The script was well crafted, and the excellent performances from all involved brought it across fine. Though I must say, the real star is the city of Mumbai itself, captured perfectly on cameras, thanks to the superb cinematography. My only minor criticism was that I wasn't sure what the dance at the end was all about;apart from that the acting, direction and scripting were all top notch, and made it the wonderful film that it actually is. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Slumdog Millionaire
2,bkoganbing,It's not supposed to be in his experience,8,9 July 2016,"Slumdog Millionaire which earned 8 Oscars including a Best Picture has some elements of a couple of other films that I liked. It also has no nominations in the acting categories.For the latter I think it's a combined performance. Protagonist Dev Patel whose life we see in flashback gives a performance with two other juvenile actors. It's a combined look at his life so I think no one actor could or should be credited that way. In fact Patel is telling his life in the interrogation room of a police station.Patel is a slum kid referred to as slumdogs by the Indian cops. He's a guest on the Indian version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire and he's one answer away from the all or nothing grand prize jackpot. He's hauled away and interrogated by the Mumbai cops who just don't believe some slum kid from Mumbai could know things like who is on the American hundred dollar bill and who invented the revolver. But it turns out that as they question him and rather brutally at times, he's acquired this trivial pursuit type knowledge through life experience.I was so reminded of Stand And Deliver when the cops haul away Dev Patel because they won't believe some uneducated slumdog kid could know so much. If you remember Edward James Olmos's math class all got retested with strict monitoring to prove they were the real deal. As for the scenes of Indian life and what the ragamuffin kids go through the influence of the Brazilian film Pixote is clearly visible. Occidental director Danny Boyle did a great job of capturing the overpopulation and dire poverty so omnipresent in the world's largest democracy. If population trends keep going India may well pass China as the world's largest country.With a Best Picture Oscar, the Indian cinema has clearly arrived on the American consciousness if nowhere else. Oscars tend to do that with Americans.",Slumdog Millionaire
3,Leofwine_draca,Style over substance,5,15 February 2012,"SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE shines through as one of the more fresh-feeling British films of recent years. I say that as somebody who's no fan of Danny Boyle, even though I've previously enjoyed a couple of his movies (namely 28 DAYS LATER and 127 HOURS). What stands out about this movie is its structure: the film has an unlikely contestant playing the Indian version of Who Wants to be a Millionaire? and his back story is told via flashbacks relating to the answers of each question that he happens to know. It's gimmicky, but on a second watch I found this style-over-substance hyperactive approach to be distracting more than anything, and more than a little annoying. It also feel like Boyle overcomplicates things in order to hide plot holes and the simplicity of his plotting.As for the storyline, it's completely clichéd, a familiar rags-to-riches tale of a youngster's rise from poverty in the slums of Mumbai to where he is today. Along the way, there's a sub-plot involving lost (and found) love, which screams 'predictable' if you look at it too long. The most harrowing scenes are those involving violence against the innocent. The story is set against a backdrop of corrupt policemen, religious violence and gangsters who have no qualms about mutilating children. Boyle doesn't hold back, and the film strengthens as a result of this realism. The cast are hard to fault; Dev Patel gives the one performance that he's entirely suited to, and Freida Pinto is the one to watch. On a second watch, I found my attention flagging; for a far more mature and complex look at slum life, CITY OF GOD walks all over this.",Slumdog Millionaire
4,SnoopyStyle,The only thing I don't like is the game show,7,11 May 2014,"Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) is a resident of the Mumbai slums. He is on India's version of 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?' He is one question away from winning it all, but the police arrest him on suspicion of cheating. The police (Irrfan Khan) tortures him and Jamal tells them his life story where he learned the answers to each one of the questions. Brothers Salim and Jamal are left orphans after a mob killed their mother. They take in Latika who was also left alone by the same mob. Jamal would spend his life rescuing his one true love Latika.This is directed by Danny Boyle. It's done with great skills. I love the exotic locations of Indian. It is beautifully filmed with great energy. I love the little kids. The little kid covered with excrement is hilarious. Their stories are compelling. The one thing I don't like about the movie is actually the game show. It feels very cheesy like that TV game show. It revels in its cheesiness, and that bleeds into the movie. I think it's meant to increase the fun content of the movie and it's a great way to construct the backbone of the movie. For me, the game show and police interrogation are more like speed bumps that break up the more interesting story of the 3 kids. I almost wish to watch the movie without the game show backdrop. Quite frankly, I wish the show and the questions were more interesting. The only thing that I find fascinating about the game show is the host's attempt to trick Jamal.",Slumdog Millionaire
5,Hitchcoc,Sprawling Humanity,9,1 September 2009,"I am always hesitant to see a movie after hearing all the hype. I was wondering if the Film Academy had just kind of decided to go in a different direction (as they often do). I was greatly moved by this film and the story of the young man who overcomes not just the horrors of his existence but the prejudice drummed up by those who assume he must be too stupid to do well. l was greatly impressed by the squalor and the long shots of the city. This movie shows the slums so well. It reminded me of the Casbah, where one lives in a maze and can find his way around in it when being chased. These kids are products of their culture and know no other way. There are so many scenes that are so impressive. The boy who drops into the excrement of the outhouse so he can get an autograph of his favorite actor. The horrors of the Fagin character who exploits children, makes them a band of beggars. There is, mostly, however, the story of the central figure who is complex and worldly and suspicious and brave beyond his own years. The other mass character is the Indian people who begin to follow the boy's successes on ""Who Wants to Be a Millionairre."" I will never forget the portrayal of the city and the filth and the spirit that runs through here. This is masterful storytelling.",Slumdog Millionaire
6,mark.waltz,Truly strikes from the heart.,10,23 September 2021,"There is so much to praise about this beautiful Indian film that shows the world the plight of a sweet young Indian man (the awesome Dev Patel) as he reflects on the circumstances which lead him to become the top dog on the Indian version of a rather tedious and often obnoxious American quiz show. I despise the show but adore details of the Indian culture throughout history even if the cruel treatment of the lower class disgusts me. Young Jamal is played by three actors, the youngest being Ayush Mahesh Khedekar whom you'll just want to hug, even after he is forced to jump down into the human waste underneath an outhouse that he was locked in. Tanay Chheda is precocious and opportunistic as the middle Jamal, toughened up by his youthful experiences yet still sweet underneath his bravado con games of gullible tourists. Of course Dev Patel is the most remembered, soft spoken as his notoriety for winning the game becomes well known. The reason he probably didn't get an Oscar nomination is because of the lengthy time he is off screen. But he is subtle and cunning as he deals with the condescending host and the law who believes that he cheated. Like how possibly could he cheat?This film will draw you in from the moment it starts, showing the squalor of the peasants and the evil ways and they are treated by Authority. Poor Jamal must explain himself in the most condescending of ways, and the fact that they don't believe him simply because he is poor is truly disgusting. You get excellent photography, a beautiful music score by A. R.
Rahman and a story that has you rooting for him from the start. This shows both the beauty and horror of growing up in the lower caste, a common theme in many Bollywood movies which Broadway audiences got to experience with the musical ""Bombay Dreams"" which also featured music by Rahman. This is perfect in every way, probably the best ""Best Picture"" of the millennium so far.",Slumdog Millionaire
7,claudio_carvalho,The Three Musketeers,10,23 January 2009,"In Mumbai, the eighteen year-old orphan from the slums Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) is tortured by the policemen in a precinct accused of cheating a game show. Jamal, who has no education and works in a call center serving tea, is close to win twenty million rupees in the show ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" hosted by Prem Kumar (Anil Kapoor), giving precise answers to the questions and raising suspicion of fraud. The police inspector shows the videotape and after each question, Jamal tells parts of his childhood with his brother Salim, his crush for Latika and their fight to survive on the streets to justify each correct answer, guided by his common sense and past experience, and prove his innocence.The awesome"" Slumdog Millionaire"" is one of the best movies I have recently seen. The story is an original and simple tale of love, serendipity and fortune, in the environment of poverty and criminality in the slums and streets of India; but the screenplay is fantastic, using flashbacks to disclose the life of the lead character, his brother and his passionate and pure love for another orphan in a perfect development of the characters and the plot. The acting is top-notch, and the boys and girls that perform the lead roles (young Jamal, Salim and Latika) have also amazing performances. In the credits, there is a great surprise with the cast singing and dancing like in most Bollywood productions. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): Not AvailableNote: On 22 February 2009, this movie was awarded with eight Oscar, including Best Picture and Best Director.",Slumdog Millionaire
8,kosmasp,Feel Good Fairy Tale,8,12 August 2009,"When you watch the beginning it's almost clear, what will happen at the end. Still Danny Boyle keeps it fresh and gives us flashbacks of what happened up to that point. Flashbacks that are sometimes pretty violent. No wonder some Studios seemed to have a problem with promoting the movie. Although as Historz will show, it was their miss (just count the Oscars the movie won).Danny Boyle really went all the way and took some chances. Casting unknowns (Freida Pinto makes her first on screen appearance, I don't even know what she did prior to filming ""Slumdog""), tackling a subject matter that is unusual to say the least and being graphic and sometimes pretty brutal too, this was anything but a calculated Oscar movie. For that you alone you have to salute him.Overall a very good movie then (see my Summary line), with a few things that I didn't quite like. The story is too fairy tale, the brothers decision to change his mind and help Dev's character etc. etc. Things that were almost too fairy tale for my taste and didn't work 100% with the rest of the movie. Those are only minor things and 8/10 is pretty good in my book.",Slumdog Millionaire
9,classicsoncall,"""When somebody asks me a question I tell them the answer.""",7,18 October 2017,"A lot of buzz when this film came out, both from movie goers and the industry itself. Since I'm usually well behind the curve on pictures like this, my reaction today with almost a decade gone by is that I don't see what the fuss was all about. It may have been a good old fashioned rags to riches story, but it was a contrived rags to riches story. One expects the kind of coincidence needed to carry a story forward in films of the Forties, Fifties or Sixties, but this was 2008, and seemed to require some lazy writing to pull off. To wit, each and every question that Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) was presented, there was some association with it during his past life. I won't deny that there may be occasional times when some element of cosmic serendipity enters one's life but the repetition that took place here defied the laws of probability. And the idea that Jamal would actually be hauled off and tortured by authorities because they thought he cheated, well I don't know, that seemed brutally excessive, don't you think? I think the game show moderator, if he felt that his popularity was being challenged by the chai wallah whiz kid, could have fixed the show's questions with ones that no one could have possibly answered. Heck, I got half of them myself with a lucky guess or two, same as Jamal. Well, you just never know. Best Picture with four additional Oscar Wins? Good deal if you can pull it off, but I just don't see it.",Slumdog Millionaire
10,gavin6942,Danny Boyle's Best Work to Date?,8,30 November 2010,"A young man (Dev Patel) appears on the Indian version of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"" He wins, but is quickly suspected of cheating because of his lower-class background. But he is able to explain how he knows each and every answer.The film is directed by Danny Boyle, who had previously dazzled audiences with a wide variety of films including ""Trainspotting"" and ""28 Days Later"". This took his status as ""great"" and pushed it up over the top, into Oscar status...The film is, on the surface, the story of one man who strikes it rich. But this is, of course, not the real story: it is an exposition of India and Indian culture, showcasing the poverty that runs rampant there in the world's largest democracy. We see piles of trash, pits for excrement, and more unsavory things being just a part of life for the people in this film. Having one of the biggest economies may not mean much when you also have an overpopulation problem.I love the rocking soundtrack with a distinct Indian flavor, but also plenty of suspense and energy. And not just in the music... will he or will he not win the money? There is no doubt this deserved to be noticed by the Academy. In fact, Danny Boyle's earlier films deserved to be more than the cult films they have become. But better late than never, I suppose. Please do yourself a favor and see this film.",Slumdog Millionaire
11,lee_eisenberg,India wink,8,26 July 2010,"The Best Picture winner of 2008 depicts young Jamal (Dev Patel) from Mumbai's slums winning on India's version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"" but getting suspected of cheating. During the interrogation, Jamal tells the police inspector how he learned the answers through his childhood experiences.First of all, this is a fascinating look at the subcontinent. I got a feeling of how it is to come of age in these cramped, gritty ghettos that dot South Asia (although that's probably nothing compared to living the experience). By gritty, I mean squat toilets, raids by Hindu mobs on the Muslims, and forced labor. And in the end, the ghettos get cleared to make way for modern high-rises. But Jamal does whatever he has to in order to pull through, and never abandons his love for Latika (Freida Pinto).""Slumdog Millionaire"" is one impressive scene after another. Whether showing dance sequences, chases, or an entire focus on the Taj Mahal, director Danny Boyle (of ""Trainspotting"" fame) does everything right. I should say that I probably wouldn't have given this movie Best Picture over ""Milk"", but this is still a good one. Given India's rising international clout, I wonder if we'll be seeing more Oscar winners, and hopefully ones that focus on the social status in the world's second most populous country. Definitely worth seeing.",Slumdog Millionaire
12,jboothmillard,Slumdog Millionaire,8,17 March 2009,"This film has surely put British film-making back on the map, a fantastic success for versatile Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning director Danny Boyle (Trainspotting, 28 Days Later). Basically 18-year-old orphan ""slumdog"" Jamal K. Malik (BAFTA nominated Dev Patel) is being interrogated by the Police Inspector (Irrfan Khan) with Sergeant Srinivas (Saurabh Shukla), after appearing on the Indian version of ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"", hosted by Prem Kumar (Anil Kapoor). Because he knows all the answers to the questions, they are accusing him of cheating, but he explains how he knew, and we see how through a series of flashbacks. The flashbacks see Jamal (middle - Tanay Hemant Chheda, youngest - Ayush Mahesh Khedekar), with brother Salim (older - Madhur Mittal, middle - Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala, youngest - Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail), and their life in the slums of Mumbai, and the adventures and vicious encounters they go through. This includes Jamal meeting Latika (older - BAFTA nominated Freida Pinto, middle - Tanvi Ganesh Lonkar, youngest - Rubiana Ali), the girl he loved and lost. Each chapter of his life reveals how he learnt the answers to all his seemingly impossible questions, until reaching the present day, where one question remains. With sixty million viewers watching, having used Ask The Audience and 50:50 already, Jamal uses the final lifeline, Phone A Friend, for his brother Salim, but instead (after a little wait), Latika is the one who answers the phone, she and Jamal cared more about talking to each other than the question, which she didn't know the answer to anyway. But it doesn't matter, Jamal decided as long as she saw him on TV, he might as well take a guess, a big risk, but it pays off, and he walks away with the jackpot of 20 million rupees, and it ends with he and Latika reunited. I wasn't expecting a dance sequence during a few minutes of the credits, but this just adds to sure enjoyment to be had with this energetic rags-to-riches tale full of tragic, comical and enlightening moments, with a wonderful use of colour, good on location cities, and terrific music, a brilliant British film. It won the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Music, Original Score for A. R. Rahman, Best Song for ""Jai Ho"", Best Sound, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published and Best Motion Picture of the Year, and it was nominated for Best Song for ""O Saya"" and Best Sound Editing, it won the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Music, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Sound and Best Film, and it was nominated for Outstanding British Film and Best Production Design, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Original Score and Best Screenplay. Very good!",Slumdog Millionaire
13,ccthemovieman-1,Deserved The Oscar For Cinematography,8,15 April 2009,"I thought the best part of this movie was the photography. Check this film out on Blu-Ray, if you have the opportunity: it's magnificent-looking. They even make slums look beautiful! I'm glad it won the Oscar for cinematography. Scene after scene is gorgeous.Story-wise, it's okay; good, but nothing super. For the first half of the film, it reminded me of ""City Of God,"" about the homeless kids in Brazil, but that film had far more violent kids. This one mainly had kids as pranksters and then victims of some sicko adult who wants to use them to make money.The story will be fun for those who used to be hooked on the ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"" quiz show, but the host here in this Indian version is no lovable Regis Philbin. You won't like him.Almost all of the story is told in flashback, so be prepared for that. It's one of those stories where all the little pieces fit together in the end to explain why things happened in the start of the film.I wouldn't have voted for this as the Best Picture Of The Year but it is entertaining and a feast for the eyes.",Slumdog Millionaire
14,Tweekums,A modern fairy tale,10,3 August 2009,"I'd heard plenty of good reviews of this film before watching it and obviously knew it had raked in the Oscars but that often isn't a great indicator of a great film, in this case however I think it deserved all of the critical acclaim.Dev Patel plays Jamal Malik, a young man who grew up in the slums of Bombay and is one question away from winning the Indian version of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"". It seems to those running the show, and to the police that he must have cheated after all it isn't very likely that an uneducated boy from the slums could get further than anybody else had done in the programme. What follows is a series of fantastical episodes each showing how an event in his life had taught him the answers to the questions.Throughout most of the escapades Jamal is accompanied by his brother Salim who later gets involved with gangsters in the now renamed Mumbai. They are also joined by a young slum-girl called Latika who is loved by Jamal; each time they get separated he does all he can to find her again, even after several years of separation.The acting is pretty good, especially from the three young children in the earliest flashbacks who were thoroughly enchanting. While it is sold as a feel-good film there is an awful lot feel-bad before things turn out as they do, of course this makes the feel-good feel all the better. I really enjoyed this film and would certainly recommend it to any adult wanting to see something different.",Slumdog Millionaire
15,Quinoa1984,one of Danny Boyle's best!,10,7 December 2008,"When film can uplift someone emotionally by having two characters who should be together, (mostly) want to be together, and who are as the cliché goes ""made"" for each other, and it's done without false sentimentality (different from sentiment, which Slumdog has in spades), it can be one of the best things in movies. Danny Boyle's film is one of those and, like another masterful take on romance from this year (WALL-E), it utilizes cinematic style, urgent and sometimes feverish and joyfully passionate turns with the camera and editing, to take us to incredible heights.In fact, this is very much a Capra-esqe picture, but in a manner that doesn't insult today's intelligence or betray any of the characters' genuine emotional components. Boyle plunges us into the story of Jamal (Dev Patel, as older Jamal, in an outstanding breakthrough performance), who lives a young life in the slums of Mumbai and Bombay and other places, with only his older, mischievous brother Salim, and a girl named Latika. They're the ""Three Musketeers"" of the story, but they go through a series of circumstances and events that pulls them apart, brings them together, and tears them away once more via gangster connections with Salim and Latika's basic imprisonment under the mob or whoever's control.Like in any strong love story, we got to have someone to root for, and Jamal is one that makes us root for him so much along the way (not least of which when he is in the midst of his nail-biter of a shot on ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"") because he is a good person, a genuine one, so much so there may be one or two scenes we might wonder if Latika is ""good enough"" for Jamal's overwhelming desire to be with her, to take her away from all the terrible elements of slum life. But ultimately, they're a as pure souls as are, in their own rotten way, the criminals, and even the (eventually) conflicted brother Salim.A lot happens that I could go on more about in Slumdog Millionaire, but it's moot to try and go into the big plot points or even some of the surprising twists. This is just absolute, crystal-clear terrific storytelling by a director who trusts his actors to find the ripe nuggets of truth with the characters- what makes them basic and honest or dishonest- when faced with the various clichés or conventions or a story like this. And on top of having a great cast, and having such a wonderful and varied taste in music (some Indian, some not), and of a deft attention to the plot as it skips from back and forth from the interrogation of Jamal to childhood and back in little flashes, it's also as dazzlingly filmed and executed via cinematography as anything from Boyle's cannon.He's never one to lack appropriate style or to push the envelope just a little further to make his stories so absorbing (Trainspotting and 28 Days Later come to mind as prime examples), but rarely has one seen so much attention to the raw power of the characters and the actors as in here. Even with Millions, also dealing with mostly child actors, Slumdog Millionaire gives Boyle a showcase for his talents as a provocateur with the camera, as a constant experimenter, while making sure we don't lose sight of those he's got in his sights. It's more than just appropriate to use such force as a filmmaker for such a tender and tragic/hopeful story, it's almost required. Boyle reaches up to that and then some: some of the shots in this movie are hard to lose out of your mind (that sudden vision of the blue Hindu child during the massacre is one, but there are countless others), and I for one can't wait to revisit them again.

16,tavm,"Slumdog Millionaire was pretty entertaining, if a little okay, as a recent Oscar winner",8,11 August 2009,"Just watched this on a Blu-Ray DVD with my brother-in-law, an elderly aunt, and my mom and dad, both of whom left for long periods. This Best Picture winner being awarded at this year's Oscars, not to mention that of Best Director for Danny Boyle, was heartfelt to me when I watched the ""Academy Awards"" earlier several months ago. Despite that, I'm not sure if it actually deserved those awards. Still, I was for the most part touched by the various actors that played Jamal, his older brother Salim, and the girl Latika. And the suspense that surrounded Jamal's answering questions on ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" were certainly pretty nail-biting especially concerning the host's treatment of him. So on that note, I highly recommend Slumdog Millionaire.",Slumdog Millionaire
17,michaelRokeefe,Unswerving love and determination.,8,1 April 2009,"An absolute winner from director Danny Boyle. Without a penny to his name, Jamal Malik(Dev Patel, his fate is verging on change in a major way. The young boy, a product of the slums of Mumbai(formerly Bombay), is one question away from winning India's version of ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"". While answering each question, Jamal reminisces of watching his mother being slaughtered in an attack on Muslims. He and his brother Salim(Madhur Mittal)battling to survive the harsh streets as orphans and the thoughts of meeting true love Latika(Freida Pinto). Jamal would be arrested and tortured by the police under suspicion of cheating, for how could a ""slumdog"" possess the knowledge to be so close to winning the popular TV game. Millions of viewers are watching in awe and admiration ...probably more important than that final question is the fact he may be losing his beloved Latika.A definite feel-good movie.

The recognition given to this film like its 8 Oscars together with the other 104 awards is a testament to that.The acting in this movie is solid.Dev Patel provides great performance as the older Jamal as he is able so solicit our empathy and care for his idealistic character. Frieda Pinto,who played older Latika,was effective as Jamal's love interest. While Madhur Mittal was excellent as the pragmatic and tragic older Salim.All the rest of the cast were commendable as well.Special mention should be given to Anil Kapoor as the annoying and arrogant game show host;Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail and Ayush Mahesh Khedekar as the youngest Salim and youngest Jamal respectively as both child actors carried the first 1/3 of the film superbly; Irrfan Khan as the brutal police inspector;Saurabh Shukla as the police sergeant;Ankur Vikal as Maman; and Rubina Ali for her screen presence as the youngest Latika.The direction of David Boyle to say the least was prefect.There was no dull moment in the film for it was flawless from first scene up to the end.Credit also should be given to Simon Beaufoy's screenplay.And last but not the least,A.R. Rahman's original score and original song,"" Jai Ho"" is definitely worth the praise and the Oscars and other awards presented to them.If one is feeling down and upset about the situation in life,watch this film and capture the warmth,hope and inspiration it provides.Just as it is written that Jamal's destiny it to win the grand prize and to be with Latika for the rest of his life,it is also written that this film is will fill the viewer with a great pleasure for it is a masterpiece for it is not only the best picture of 2008 but of the decade.Highly recommended. A 10/10 rating. It truly deserves to be among the top 250 films of IMDb.",Slumdog Millionaire
19,Theo Robertson,A Film That Works Better As An Inspiration Rather Than A Film,7,4 June 2009,"SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is a movie that's a victim of its marketing . The screenplay is adapted by Simon Beaufoy from a novel by Indian writer Vikas Swarup . These two things should be remembered before watching the film . Beaufoy was the writer of THE FULL MONTY a film that was marketed as a comedy of sorts when in fact it was a rather downbeat gloomy narrative saved only by the upbeat ending . SLUMDOG is the same type of movie except it's even more gloomy , not to mention violent at some points . "" The feel good movie of the year "" ? yes but you'll have to wade through a lot of misery to get there The entire subtext revolves around the Hindu philosophy of Karma ie things happen for a reason , even the worst things happen for a reason and it's important to remember this . This is the only thing you should think of before watching the movie . The plot turns are not coincidences because Karma has chosen Jamal Malik for great things but first he must undergo heart breaking soul destroying things that he can never forget . In short this film is easier to respect than to enjoy or even like but the fundamental core of the story is food for the soul . You suffer heart breaking divorce ? Take comfort that in a future part of your life that you're free to live your life the way you want . You have no life , no friends , no future and every day is composed of watching dire movies ? Slag off the films on a website and someone will you give you Roger Ebert's job . Make a film set in Indian slums with subtitles and expect it to go straight to DVD because there's no way no one will watch it or nominate it for awards. Or will they ?Anything is possible screams SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE and anything is . It's not a film that's likable and while Danny Boyle is an exceptional film maker I doubt if this is his masterwork , certainly 28 DAYS LATER and TRAINSPOTTING were better films . But as far as SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE goes it's a reminder that the future is unwritten and perhaps maybe destiny has great plans for all of us",Slumdog Millionaire
20,dbborroughs,I liked it I didn't love it,6,6 January 2009,"Probable Oscar nominee didn't float my boat. Its a good film but I don't know whether too many people have told me how great it is or is it not that great and people are simply reacting to the exotic nature of the film, either way it didn't blow my skirt up.This is the story of Jamal who is on the verge of winning 20 million rupees in India's Who Wants to be a Millionaire. Certain this lower class kid must be cheating he's in the police station where some extreme methods are being employed to find out how he's cheating. Insisting that he is not cheating Jamal recounts his life's story with appropriate pauses to explain how he knows the answers.Far from what I expected, I didn't expect the level of violence, this is a good little film. Its the sort of thing where luck, or is it fate, allows you enough information to get ahead. Its the sort of thing designed to make you feel good.As I said I'm not in love with the film. I like it but I'm not in love with it. Perhaps its a little too cute at times (The kid in the poop) and it didn't help that the romance vital to much of the later part of the film didn't feel right to me.As an exercise in film-making its a masterful achievement blending a variety of styles into something uniquely its own. Danny Boyle is quite simply one of the best filmmakers working today one need only look at the last four films he's directed to see the range he has. Its a dizzying, great looking, great sounding film that makes even the squalor of India seem magical. I wish more directors had Boyle's abilities.That said the film didn't click with me. I respect the people who've fallen in love with the film enough to give the film a second go down the line., but for now Its a good film that I don't think is one of the best of the year.(For those, like me who didn't realize this was as violent as it it be warned- There are shootings, clubbings, torture, people set on fire, and nastiness to children. Its not a film for kids, though reviews I've seen made it seem so)",Slumdog Millionaire
21,Bunuel1976,"SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE (Danny Boyle, 2008) ***",7,18 March 2009,"A curious mix of CITY OF GOD (2002) and QUIZ SHOW (1994), this surprising multi-Oscar winner is a good film to be sure but also somewhat overrated (as was director Boyle's TRAINSPOTTING [1996] after all). The editing is deftly intricate (spanning several years, the story continually jumps back and forth in time) and the exotic score certainly effective; however, Boyle's flashy technique rings false within the context of its underprivileged setting! SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE may have alerted the rest of the world to the dire conditions of life in (the so-called) modern India but, at the same time, it cannot have benefited the country's tourist industry any! The film's trump card is actually the 'impossible romance' at its core: the two young leads are believable and undeniably appealing. The whole ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"" angle, then, has a decidedly contrived feel to it: though apparently based on fact, the film was clearly intended as a fable. That said, some of the flashbacks do not really illuminate us as to how the hero knew the respective answer: for instance, does someone need to know who invented the revolver just because he owns one (much less an uneducated person) and would the final all-important question of such a show be one to which the answer could have easily been arrived at by common sense (had it not been a recurring motif)?",Slumdog Millionaire
22,zardoz-13,"Bravo, Danny Boyle!",10,4 March 2009,"British director Danny Boyle, best known for ""Trainspotting"" and ""The Beach,"" has made the rags-to-riches feel-good film of the year with ""Slumdog Millionaire."" Mind you, Indian co-director Loveleen Tandan, who served as a second unit director on ""Monsoon Wedding"" (2001), helped Boyle out. Set in contemporary India, this winsome tale about three dirt-poor orphans who rise above abject squalor and poverty to attain their most outlandish dreams of romance and riches qualifies as modern day Charles Dickens morality play. Indeed, you could also compare ""Slumdog Millionaire"" to those vintage 1930s' Warner Brothers crime classics where one kid plunges down the wrong path while the other takes the right path. Ultimately, the brothers here find themselves at odds with each other on different sides of the law. The bad people are punished in ""Slumdog,"" while the good people are rewarded. ""Full Monty"" scenarist Simon Beaufoy based his lively script on diplomat-turned-novelist Vikas Swarup's first book, ""Q & A,"" about an Indian waiter who was arrested for cheating on a quiz show. Don't let the foreign oriented storyline discourage you from enjoying this inspirational yarn. Boyle provides interesting, off-beat looking subtitles for the Hindu dialogue, but the cast deliver most of the lines in English. If you're looking for a change of pace, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is just the ticket. As upbeat and optimistic as ""Slumdog"" is, prepare yourself for some scenes that may make you wince. ""Slumdog"" deserved its R-rating as much as it deserved his Best Picture Oscar. This movie is far more entertaining than the imaginative but long-winded Brad Pitt epic ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button."" Basically, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" concerns the coincidences that land a teenage Muslim refugee from the Bombay slums, Jamal Malik (Dev Patel), on the Indian equivalent of the ABC-TV show ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire."" Since he is a product of the slums, our long-suffering hero is regarded with considerable suspicion. Jamal keeps surprising the slimy quiz show host Prem Kumar (veteran Bollywood actor Anil Kupoor) with one correct answer after another and the jealous Kumar turns him over to the authorities. Kumar is convinced that Jamal is a cheater. Kumar is far from saintly himself and doesn't want Jamal to steal his glory. It seems Kumar's meteoric rise in show business came about as a result of giving the right answers on a game show. At the outset, ""Slumdog"" creates suspense for audiences with the important question: ""Jamal Malik is one question away from winning 20 million rupees. How did he do it? A. He cheated. B. He's lucky. C. He's a genius. D. It is written."" Indeed, Jamal is poised to win more wealth that he can possibly imagine when the police subject him to a night of torture. They beat him up and finally attach jumper cables to his toes to make him confess. Our stubborn hero refuses to capitulate. The chief police investigator, Irfan Khan (Irrfan Khan), finds it difficult to believe that a kid from the slums could know so much.Boyle's strategy in ""Slumdog"" is to alternate each unusual question that our beleaguered hero answers with an episode from his traumatic life that relates to each question. The scene when Jamal plunges into an outdoors toilet, covering himself from head-to-toe in human feces, so he can obtain an autograph from his favorite movie superstar is hilarious. Actually, the fecal matter consisted of peanut butter and chocolate. (This scene is reminiscent of a similar episode from ""Trainspotting"" where an Edinburgh junkie dives into a toilet to retrieve a narcotic suppository.) During his youth, Jamal and his brother Salim (Madhur Mital) encounter some genuinely sleazy characters, especially one unsavory fellow who likes to 'rescue' orphans from the streets so that he can turn them into beggars. This part of ""Slumdog"" may remind you of Charles Dickens's second novel ""Oliver Twist."" Anyway, this scoundrel likes to blind small children and send them out to beg and sing for money. Jamal and Salim escape from this life, but in doing so, Jamal abandons--against his will--a girl named Latika (Frieda Pinto) for whom he has sworn his undying love. Of course, the evil child exploiter sells Latika to men who want to see her dance. Hmm, I wonder what the Indian Tourist Bureau thinks about this saga. Ten years ago, ""Slumdog"" would have taken place in Brazil. Suffice to say that the hero and heroine are separated with little chance of being reunited. Happily, however, ""Slumdog"" takes several astonishing twists and turns before fade-out that will surprise you, and ultimately make you feel good, perhaps even great, depending on how much you love fairy tales.Although it runs two hours in length, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" never wastes a second. Boyle and Tandan turn this helter-skelter saga into a roller-coaster. As a glimpse of India, ""Slumdog"" is enlightening as well as horrifying. If nothing else, you'll learn to never shed your shoes around the Taj Mahal. The casting of our heroes from adolescence to teenagers is nothing short of brilliant. This is no Hollywood hokum where the children look nothing like the adults. Jamal follows the straight and narrow after Salim and he indulge in juvenile delinquency that recalls the shenanigans of the Jewish kids in Sergio Leone's gangster classic ""Once Upon a Time in America."" You won't forget ""Slumdog Millionaire."" The irony of all this is ""Slumdog,"" which received 8 Oscars as well as two more Oscar nominations, almost wound up going straight to DVD because nobody believed it could recoup its $15 million budget. At this point, ""Slumdog"" has coined over $116 million dollars!",Slumdog Millionaire
23,grantss,Great movie,9,13 October 2014,"Great movie. Very moving, brutal in its portrayal of the poverty the main characters live in, but with humorous moments too. Bitter-sweet. Deserves all the awards and award nominations it is getting.The only negative thing, and the reason it isn't a perfect 10, is the way the movie got fairly formulaic towards the end. I can think of at least one ending which would have been more impactful than the actual one.If you liked this movie, see ""City of God"".

24,Boba_Fett1138,An original but far from perfect movie.,7,6 March 2012,"Really, I am an enormous Danny Boyle fan but his most acclaimed movie, which is this one, is one I consider to be one of his weakest and is only one that still works out because of its originally.Danny Boyle is one of the most versatile directors out there. He can do a movie in basically every genre and turn it into something totally unique. This movie however doesn't really fit into one genre. Is it a drama? Is it a crime movie? Is it a romance? It was a bit of all really, which in my opinion was a bit too much for the movie to handle.The idea of the movie itself is good but the approach and execution of it was often slightly lacking. I just didn't always bought into its concept and the movie always gave me a feeling it could had done so much more with its with its main concept, also to make the movie a bit more credible and interesting at times.The movie was trying to do too much different stuff in my opinion. The storytelling techniques and the story lines themselves let this 2 hour long movie feel like a 3 hour long one.And I just don't understand some things about this movie. Why India? Why this main character? And why oh why would a TV program ever literally torture a contestant, just because he happens to know the right answers and why don't they want him to win? As this movie shows, they got more viewers than ever before when he was on and there are over 1.5 billion people living in India, so surely it must had earned them a lot of money and given them a lot of free press.But clearly, this is not a bad movie. I still liked it more than I didn't, which was mostly due to it that this is simply one original and simply a truly one of a kind movie. You can't really compare this movie to anything else, since it's simply at all times doing its own thing, with its visual style and storytelling.I believe that it's actually foremost its visual style that still makes this a truly good watch. It's a fast going movie, which in my opinion goes a bit at the expense of the drama and character developments at times but it does add to the movie its overall style. It strengthens its visual style and lets its dynamic camera-work, work out even better.I also really liked Dev Patel as the main lead. Perhaps he is the most underrated thing about this movie, since I feel he didn't got enough recognition for it at the time.So it's definitely a good and also original watch but still far from a great movie in my book.7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Slumdog Millionaire
25,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,As if we required more proof that the Oscars are nothing to go by when trying to find out about quality,7,30 April 2010,"It's not a coincidence that I didn't watch this when it was playing in theaters. Honestly, the notion never even crossed my mind. I found myself wondering why people whose opinion I respect were going to see it. Since then, I saw the high rating, and recently, someone that I know to have impeccable taste in movies(with the odd exception) suggested it and lent it to me. I haven't read the book, but I understand it's quite different from this. Part of what sold me on this was also Danny Boyle, as I've loved everything else I've seen by him. He brings his stunning visuals, impeccable energy as well as his ability to deliver gripping cinema, with very different plots. Wait... there's... something's missing. And I think I know what it is; the psychological/disturbing approach(let's face it, The Beach, 28 Days Later and Sunshine are thrillers to which the two aforementioned adjectives apply perfectly, and whilst it is a drama, the same can be said of Trainspotting). This is the most sentimental flick I've experienced that I would, with a straight face, call intense, brutal and unsettling. I wonder if that sounds as jarring as it is. Another big issue is that no one, least of all the leads, has *any* charisma(with that said, the acting tends to be great). Who are we supposed to care about? I suppose the Jamal dude, by default, on account of everyone else mistreating him(for crying out loud, 8 Mile wasn't *this* excessive in that regard). That's meant to awaken our sympathy for him, I would wager. I can't claim that it did for me. After two hours of film, covering rather a lot of his young life, I couldn't tell you any personal traits about him. ""He was poor, he fell for a girl and stuck with that(no matter what), and he got a chance to get out of the poverty."" Do me a favor. Copy and paste the sentence in quotes to an empty document, share it with a friend of yours, and ask if that seems familiar(not revealing that it's about this picture). If they say no, ask them how they've managed to not catch a single one of those stories before. No, it doesn't need to be original; you have to draw inspiration from somewhere. Just do... well, anything with it. All this does is put it to excellent-looking images, not bothering to give us a reason to care. Yes, it's ""grand""; so? It's fiction. Nothing's stopping it. Many characters are one-note. I read that they made the subtitles exciting, though that evidently isn't true of the version released here in Denmark. The DVD comes with a music video, and the documentary Slumdog Dreams, that I will review on its own page here on the site. I recommend this to fans of schlock or features that have an incredible appearance. 7/10",Slumdog Millionaire

27,neil-476,Excellent,9,21 January 2009,"Slumdog Millionaire uses the deceptively simple device of telling young Jamal's life story from being a small child in the slums of Bombay in order to explain how come he knows the answers to the questions on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, leaving him one question short of the top prize. The answers/his story involve (among other things) the death of his mother, a short career as a beggar, the interaction with his less scrupulous brother over the years and, beyond everything, his ongoing search for Latika, the girl he befriended when they were small children.It is not a pretty story, but it is always gripping, always visually fascinating (and sometimes appalling) to these western eyes at any rate, sometimes very humorous, and very often sufficient to make you despair at the sheer unfairness at how life - and some very unpleasant people - treat Jamal and Latika.I've heard it described as a feelgood movie, and it's certainly not that but, if I can liken it to anything, I would liken it to The Shawshank Redemption in that it is a story about the ability of the individual to strive for something positive in the face of every obstacle life can throw in your path, and the soaring joy to the spirit when that elusive goal is finally achieved.The cast, most of whom are unknown to western viewers (Dev Patel, who plays Jamal, has had some TV exposure in the UK) are uniformly excellent, and the youngsters who play the 3 principals at two different stages of childhood deserve special mention.And India plays a huge part - the film is so immersive that, much of the time, it is like being there.

28,evanston_dad,The Final Answer Is: Fake,6,17 November 2008,"""Slumdog Millionaire"" is the kind of film that many people will probably rabidly adore, because it's energetic, invigorating and, at first glance at least, feels like something we haven't seen before. But a whole other group of movie goers may find themselves resistant to its questionable charms, as I did. ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is a fake. An accomplished fake, to be sure, but a fake nonetheless.The film tells the story of Jamal, who grows up in the slums of Mumbai, India, only to find himself in the hot seat on the popular Indian television version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire."" Each question he's asked during the game show triggers a flashback sequence that fills in a little bit more of his story -- we see him become estranged from his brother, who gives himself over to the life of a gangster, and we see him stay true through all of his adversity to his one love, a girl named Latika.It's fairly clear that director Danny Boyle intends this film to be a fairy tale, with the love story providing the film its heart. But much of the film is nasty and unpleasant, reveling in every distasteful detail about Jamal's childhood. Within the first 20 minutes of the film, we've seen Jamal tortured with electricity, Jamal jumping into a vile pit of human excrement in order to get an autograph from his favorite Bollywood star (this scene is played for laughs, because isn't someone covered in sh*t always good for a laugh?) and we see his mother bludgeoned to death by anti-Muslim extremists right before Jamal's and his brother's eyes. Later, we see small children getting their eyes burned out with hot spoons in order to make them more effective beggars. Everyone in the movie but Jamal and Latika, who remain blank slates as characters, is hateful and repellent. Boyle heaps calamity on top of calamity for so much of the film that its facile, simplistic conclusion wrings impossibly false. You can't have it both ways. You can't have your film be both a gritty, slice-of-life indictment and a frothy romantic soufflé. The end product is like ""City of God"" meets ""Moulin Rouge!"" This isn't the first time I've felt this way about Danny Boyle movies. He frequently strikes me as a director who's not in control of his own films. His brand of film-making mistakes the fast and furious for interesting and compelling, and he gets in the way of his own narratives, distracting us when he should be drawing us in.A lot of people might mistake this for a great film. And who knows? -- maybe it is. After all, greatness is a matter of opinion. But my opinion is that this film falls very short of greatness.Grade: B-",Slumdog Millionaire

One of my favorite overlooked films of the past five years is ""Millions"", also directed by Danny Boyle (best known for ""Trainspotting""). The screenplay is by Simon Beaufoy (""Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day"" and ""The Full Monty"") and is based on Vikas Swarup's novel ""Q&A"". Not really sure how to describe this other than a classic love story wrapped in a rags-to-riches story of survival.We get a glimpse of India's underbelly without it being a guilt-ridden social statement. The movie is actually three parts interwoven beautifully. The working class pauper is having a nice run of success on ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"". Of course his success brings with it the assumption of cheating. As he is being wickedly tortured and questioned by the police, we are provided flashbacks into Jamal's childhood which explain each of the answers he ""miraculously"" knows.The only actor most American audiences will recognize is Irfan Khan as the sadistic police interrogator. Mr. Khan will be remembered as the wise father in ""The Namesake"". Despite that, the acting is superb and we are treated to story lines of our three main characters at three different stages in their life.This is purely expert film-making with a creative and multi-faceted story.

Madhur Mittal appears as Jamal's brother, Salim, who resorts to crime while Freida Pinto plays, Latika, the girl Jamal loves.If you're not used to the horrors of overpopulation and poverty in modern India you're in for a culture shock as this movie shows India in all its glory and shame. A friend of mine lives in Hyderabad and he regularly sends me pics of orphaned kids living on garbage, etc., just like in the movie; of course he does his small part to try to save them.The big question of the film is: How does Jamal, a teen who grew up in one of the worst slums on earth, possibly know the answers to the questions on the TV show? The charismatic-but-somewhat-sinister host (Anil Kapoor) thinks it's dubious, so he delivers Jamal over to a detective (Irrfan Khan) and his cronies (Saurabh Shukla) to find out how he's cheating. If Jamal's not cheating then how does he know the answers? The movie shows you.This is a hip, kinetic film with a potent message that you might not fully grasp upon your first viewing. Pay close attention to the interrogation & conclusions of the detective. Notice Jamal's integrity, persevering faith and idealist love for Latika.

34,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Slumdog Millionaire,10,14 February 2009,"Deep down inside, I personally believe some game shows are rigged to a certain degree. After all, organizers do try to profile you through a questionnaire which also contain clauses such as telling-nothing-but-the-truth-or-you-risk-forfeiting-any-prizes-won. So you're presenting yourself on a silver platter for opportunities to exploit both your strengths, if they choose to make you a hero, or your weaknesses, should you so be deemed as being there for entertainment value. This of course does not apply to some situations where obvious hints are provided so that you're given an idiot-proof situation to make away with some cash, should the sponsors be generous.Game shows are mathematical and probability at its best, and of course one that can be programmed such that the house can win all, or choose to let you go for a little bit of laughter at the side. You can be asked questions that you know or to do something that you're comfortable with, from the profile you built, or when the stakes are too high and the house's appetite for risk is somehow subdued, in comes the real challenge to see if you'd buckle under pressure, or can overcome your fears. For Jamal, (Dev Patel), he's one question away in India's Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, hosted by Prem Kumar (played by Anil Kapoor, and in real life hosted by Amitabh Bachchan who gets some mention here), to winning 20,000,000 (count the zeroes, man) rupees, given that he's answered seemingly random questions correctly, but on the show's logical break, get arrested on suspicion of fraud and tortured during interrogation to spill the beans.Based on the novel ""Q&A"" by Vikas Swarup, this Danny Boyle-Loveleen Tandan co-directed film brings us on a spiraling journey through the chapters in Jamal's life, where each episode of his tremendously rich tale of survival had Destiny place every nugget of required information toward those million dollar rupees. Hailing from the slums of Mumbai, we see how Jamal and his brother Salim carve a living out of exploiting their street smarts, even at one point being little artful dodgers themselves in a Charles Dickens tale. It boggles everyone that someone without a formal education could nab those random questions correctly, a tea boy working in a call centre, beating participants like lawyers and doctors. He captured the imagination of the entire nation, that sometimes the wildest of dreams can come true.You'll find yourself rooting for Jamal, because here's a character crafted so earnestly by the storytellers that it's hard not to root for the underdog. And his story as told to the police inspector (played by Irrfan Khan), especially in his early life, set the stage thanks to the two adorable boys playing Jamal (Ayush Mahesh Khedekar) and Salim (Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail) who arrest your attention in a solid tale of two brothers growing up who eventually set foot on very different paths - one unassuming, while the other ambitious. And nothing better to drive the wedge between them than a girl Latika (Rubiana Ali) they knew by chance, and grew up with.One of my favourite films of Danny Boyle's was Millions, where a cute little boy with tremendous imagination, held court when a bag full of cash come literally crashing down on his play house. Boyle seems to hold court again with a tale of the little ones overcoming impossible odds of survival through the honing of their street-smarts and instincts, and again shows his eclecticism in direction with some dizzying cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantle. And providing the score and music to punctuate the movie is none other than the Mozart of Mumbai A.R. Rahman, whom I hope gets his due recognition with non-Indian film fans, and even though I felt that his work here might not have been the best I've heard, it's still a great introductory platform to everyone caught up in the buzz for this movie.For a story with events firmly written in the stars, and had plenty of coincidence and luck playing a part, it never for one moment felt forced nor contrived. Everything seemed possible, which makes it magical with Destiny having a big say, but one primary fact here is that Jamal had entered the gameshow not to win money beyond his wildest dreams, but to try and reconnect and search for a love that is lost, through a media platform. It's not that far fetched an idea, because I do know from personal experience that this type of scenarios do happen, with differing success results of course.Slumdog Millionaire is up against very strong contenders for the Best Picture Oscar, but it firmly has my support as one of the best this year so far, and I'm rooting for it to take home the statuette. It's a magical film with Destiny playing a huge part in changing the lives of underdogs, where hope and belief are made chic themes again.",Slumdog Millionaire

The question is posed: how did he do it? We are presented with four answers, A) He cheated, B) He's lucky, C) He's a genius, D) It is written. The film opens with Jamal being roughly interrogated by the police, who believe that the true answer to that question is A). Jamal works as a tea boy at a call centre and lives in the city's slums, and the police refuse to believe that a mere ""slumdog"" could have the vast general knowledge needed to answer so many questions.The film then goes on to show just how Jamal knew the answers to so many questions. The gameshow itself is used as the framework of the film, with a series of flashbacks showing us key events in his childhood, many of which have some connection with question in the show. For example, one question relates to the famous Indian actor Amitabh Bachchan, whose autograph Jamal obtained as a boy. Another question, about a Hindu god, recalls communal violence between Hindus and Muslims, in which his mother was killed.Although the film is set in India, and most of the cast are Indian, it is officially a British movie with a British director, although it is very different from most previous British films about India (such as ""North-West Frontier"", ""Gandhi"" and ""A Passage to India""), most of which are period pieces set in the days of the Raj. When I reviewed ""The Kite Runner"", another film with an Asian setting, last year, I described it as a triumphant success that breaks every rule in the Hollywood book. The same description could apply with equal, if not greater, force to ""Slumdog Millionaire"". It is setting will be unfamiliar to most American or European viewers. Much of the dialogue is in a foreign language (Hindi). There are no major, or even minor, Hollywood names among the cast, nearly all of whom are Indian and some of whom (including the female lead Freida Pinto) are not professional actors. (Some of the children who appear are slum dwellers in real life). And yet it won eight Oscars, including ""Best Picture"" and ""Best Director"" for Danny Boyle. I cannot think of another ""Best Picture"" winner which has won in spite of so many potential disadvantages; ""Gandhi"" was another British film about India, but it had the advantages of being about a well-known historical figure and of featuring several well-known actors, both American and British.Why, then, has the film succeeded so brilliantly? I think that part of the answer lies in the way it draws upon what may be described as literary archetypes. It reminded me strongly of the works of Dickens. (And not only me; the critic Ann Hornaday called it ""Charles Dickens for the 21st century."") It has similar ingredients to those found in many of his novels- a combination of social realism with humour, sentimentality and a rags-to-riches story with a happy ending for the virtuous hero and his beautiful girlfriend, although not necessarily for all the other characters. ""Oliver Twist"" seems to have been a particular influence. Like Oliver, Jamal is an orphan who grows up in poverty after the death of his mother. Like Oliver, he falls in with criminals; in Jamal's case the Fagin-figure is a gangster named Maman who intends to use him as a beggar (after blinding him to increase his earning potential). And like Oliver, Jamal is able to escape from poverty through a twist of fate. (Dickens' choice of his hero's surname has clear symbolic significance). As in the novel virtue is rewarded and vice punished; in the film vice is personified not only by Maman and his fellow gangsters but also by Jamal's brother Salim, who goes to the bad and becomes a gangster himself.Other factors which contribute to the film's success include Simon Beaufoy's screenplay and Boyle's fast-paced direction which creates a sense of vibrancy and excitement, especially in action scenes like the one where Jamal and Salim escape from Maman by climbing on top of a train. Some, including critic Mick LaSalle, have criticised the film's non-linear narrative structure, which relies heavily on flashbacks, but I never had any difficulty following the action and, indeed, found this the most logical way of presenting the action. Had Boyle and Beaufoy told the story in a strictly linear fashion, with the gameshow and Jamal's arrest and interrogation being reserved until the end, this would have deprived the story of much of its drama and immediacy.Another criticism which has been made is that the film is too sunny and optimistic; one Indian critic wrote that ""Most people in the slums never achieve a fairy-tale ending."" Well, that is no doubt true, but then most poor orphans in nineteenth-century London never managed to escape from poverty, as Oliver Twist did, by turning out to be the long-lost son of a wealthy family. ""Slumdog Millionaire"" was never meant to be a documentary but a romantic melodrama, a genre of film which has always enjoyed a certain licence to depart from strict verisimilitude. And a very enjoyable one it is too. 8/10",Slumdog Millionaire
37,StevePulaski,Brings light to a drab and gloomy year,9,28 March 2012,"The year 2008 was a very bland year for films. It was a year of mediocre comedies, some fair dramas, and mixed bags all around. Great films were few and far between, and one of the biggest recessions in American history was beginning to take effect. Yes, 2008 was a dark, gloomy year, but in the pile of so-so films, emerged a surprisingly involving coming of age story that was equal parts Bollywood (despite being released by a British company) and equal parts its own American/Indian hybrid. That, of course, is the Best Picture winner Slumdog Millionaire.At the time of its release, this was likely to be the first Indian film American audiences were exposed to. It was mine, definitely, but not my first foreign film. I try and make an effort to watch not only mainstream films, but some of the lesser known pictures every year not only to showcase variety, but to inform readers that there is a world of film that doesn't involve million dollar ad campaigns and monotony. Independent/foreign films are becoming increasingly popular, and thanks to a wise decision from the Academy, Slumdog went onto get wide recognition and is honored and celebrated for the real gem it is.It follows Jamal Malik, played by a real find of a teenager, Dev Patel, a young orphan, now sixteen, who grew up in the slums of Mumbai. He was an imposter and a thief for most of his life, and had to do things he isn't proud of, but managed to pick up life lessons and impeccable knowledge despite grand limitations. He is a contestant on the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, where he is one question away from winning Rs. 20 million when the horn sounds, meaning he will have to wait until the following day to finish his run.Following the episode, he is arrested under suspicion of cheating, tortured and manipulated until forced to confessed. The film then evolves into a sort of nonlinear story of Jamal going through each of the questions he was asked and discussed what life event he had to endure for him to know the answer, proving that he is really intelligent, not a cheater.One thing struck me watching the film, something I believe very few will pick up. It must be insanely insulting to go through life a street child, having no mother or father to look up to, roaming the streets of the slums every night, searching for a place to sleep, garnering intelligence and knowledge along the way, only to go on a popular game show to be arrested under suspicion of fraud. As if you're not good enough or believable in your own roots. When you're arrested for being smart and knowledgeable, what does that say about the way the world thinks of you? Nowadays, coming of age stories about unfortunate misfits, mainstream or independent, are a dime a dozen, so it's wonderful to see attempts at breeding creativity, innovation, and intellect to a genre searching for new direction are being made. Danny Boyle's slick directing and Simon Beaufoy's intelligent writing avoid corniness and heavy-handedness by constantly moving the story in a fast-paced and entertaining way. Beaufoy and Boyle would later reunite to work on the claustrophobic thriller 127 Hours I would come to dub ""a masterpiece on film."" It's next to impossible to compare the two works, since one's goal is to evoke the same sort of fear endured by a victim, while the others' is to prevent fear and inferiority from bringing down ones' feeling of self-worth.A friend told me going into Slumdog that despite the film being very good and a nice nod to Indian cinema, it is a rather cliché story. It is, when contemplated. There's a bit of a contrived love story between Jamal and the ravishing Latika, played by Freida Pinto. Sometimes, I sort of wished that was left out. At other times, I am glad the film incorporated it. Call it perplexing, but I prefer to dub it critical indecisiveness. It depends on which angle you're viewing the subplot from. You can either see it as a fair, plausible addition to Jamal's checkered life, or as an Indian movie desperately trying to fit in by playing dress up in American clothes.Slumdog Millionaire, despite all the mixed views, hype, and questions, is a wonderful character study, set in places rarely explored. My favorite scene is during the end credits, involving a massive and well-choreographed dance scene to the infectious anthem ""Jai Ho"" by A.R. Rahman. I knew the tune long before seeing the actual film, and was amused like a young child when I finally saw the dance that concludes the film. Tell me again; how did the film bag the Best Picture award, but not Best Original Song? Starring: Dev Patel, Freida Pinto, and Mahesh Manjrekar. Directed by: Danny Boyle.",Slumdog Millionaire
38,Smells_Like_Cheese,"What I'm feeling for this film isn't love, it's pure admiration",10,22 March 2009,"Slumdog Millionaire, the best film of 2008 by far, I saw this back in December after hearing a little bit about it on the net. I was so excited to see that it was playing at my local theater and I didn't hesitate to see it when it was released. There are a lot of people who are just asking why this film is so popular or loved, the reason why in my opinion is that it's just a happy film. We usually have a best picture winner that is depressing, but instead Slumdog Millionaire just lifts your spirits and makes you cry in joy. I couldn't believe how much I loved this film, after reading a summary on what it was about, I was just confused and wondering if this film was really going to be good. But we have these unknown young actors: Dev Peitel, Freida Pinto and Madhur Mittal who pull in heart wrenching performances and you can't help but love their characters and just keep rooting for them. All in all, this film is a love story. Most film lovers fear those words after Titanic because everyone thought it to be a predictable puppy love story, this love story however is made in strength and faith and you can't help but keep wanting Jamal and Latika to be together. Even though I saw the film a while back, I still remember it like I saw it yesterday.A title card is presented: ""Jamal Malik is one question away from winning 20 million rupees. How did he do it? A) He cheated, B) He's lucky, C) He's a genius, D) It is written."" Jamal is a contestant on the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? hosted by Prem Kumar in which he was on the show and won 20,000,000 rupees (about US$500,000). Jamal then explains that, while at least the question about Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan was very simple, he knew the answers of most questions by chance, because of things that happened in his life. This is conveyed in a series of flashbacks documenting the details of his childhood. This includes scenes of him obtaining Bachchan's autograph, the death of his mother during the Hindu anti-Muslim violence, rekindling the memory of the 1993 anti-Muslim attacks in Mumbai by Hindu nationalists in the slums, and how he and his brother Salim befriend Latika. The children are eventually discovered by Maman while they live in the trash heaps. Maman is a gangster who ""collects"" street children so that he can ultimately train them to beg for money. Salim is groomed to become a part of Maman's operation and is asked to bring Jamal to Maman in order to be blinded. Salim protects his brother, and the three children try to escape; but only Salim and Jamal are able to do so. Latika is re-captured by Maman's organization and raised as a culturally talented prostitute whose virginity will fetch a high price. The brothers eke out a living, traveling on top of trains, selling goods, pretending to be tour guides at the Taj Mahal, and picking pockets. Jamal eventually insists that they return to Mumbai since he wishes to locate Latika. When he finds her working as a dancer in a brothel, the brothers attempt to rescue her, but Maman intrudes, and in the resulting conflict Salim draws a gun and kills Maman. Salim then uses the fact that he killed Maman to obtain a job with Javed a rival crime lord. Salim claims Latika as his own and when Jamal protests, Salim threatens to kill him and Latika intervenes, accepting her fate with Salim. Years later, Jamal has a position at a call center. When he is asked to cover for a co-worker for a couple of minutes, he searches the database for Salim and Latika. He gets in touch with Salim, who has become a high-ranking lieutenant in Javed's organization. Jamal confronts a regretful Salim on tense terms. Salim invites Jamal to live with him and after following Salem, he sees Latika living there. He talks his way in as the new chef and tries to convince Latika to leave. She tries to discourage him, but on the first day that Jamal waits at the train station, Latika attempts to escape with him, but is recaptured by Salim and Javed's men. One of the men then slashes her cheek with a knife, scarring her as Salim drives off, leaving Jamal with the onlooking crowd. Jamal again loses contact with Latika when Javed moves to another house. In another attempt to find Latika, Jamal tries out for the popular game show because he knows that she will be watching.I cannot wait for this movie to be released on DVD, it's a terrific uplifting movie that just captures your heart and makes you feel good. I couldn't believe that people were just complaining about the ending dance sequence, it was a TERRIFIC way to end it, to see everything that Jamal went through and that dance just makes you feel happy because you can tell the joy of him having his Latika in his arms. It was a beautiful ending and makes you extremely joyful. The story is brutal, funny, sad, original and beautiful. Danny Boyle, I knew that this director had something special when he made the horror film 28 Days Later, but who knew he could pull of such an uplifting beautifully made film? He picked the perfect actors, made the film wonderfully, and the whole crew seemed to enjoy making this together. Who wouldn't? It was a pleasure to watch on the screen and if you haven't seen this film in the theater, buy it when it comes on DVD, it's one of the most terrific experiences I've had watching a film. We haven't had a film like Slumdog Millionaire and it's one of my new favorite films of all time.10/10",Slumdog Millionaire
39,blanbrn,A film that proves no matter how harsh one's life has been thru those experiences can help one master knowledge and win big in the end!,9,23 January 2009,"Director Danny Boyle's film ""Slumdog Millionaire"" clearly has hit the jackpot with this picture an uplifting tale for anyone that sees it especially those that are poor and unlucky. Because those viewers can relate to the central character of Jamal so well. And Boyle's direction is life and storybook like as his direction of the film tells most of this troubled young man's life as the whole film is told from a flashback point of view. It's just so touching to see how each life experience of Jamal's past relates to his present as it was able to provide him with unlimited knowledge of the world that he gained from life experiences.Set in the slums of Mumbai, India we as viewers see a journey of harsh living that is experienced by one young man named Jamal Malik(Dev Patel)who along with his older brother from a young age have to deal with many problems from losing their mother, and being abandoned during war time. Along the way the streets are a way of life and survival for them as they drift from location to location only Jamal gradually learns the culture of how to break from the thug world. As without much money Jamal had to survive on his wits to make money this knowledge would benefit him greatly later. Aside from a journey of dealing with the harsh world of cynical thugs and learning the streets Jamal is in part involved up in a love story. When meeting the beautiful Latika(Freida Pinto). Her beauty and love provides some escape for Jamal.It is then when upon Jamal working after leaving his brother and the beauty behind decides to go for the gold so to speak. Jamal becomes a contestant on the Hindi version of ""Who Wants to be A Millionaire"" as he feels this is the only way to the path of a good life and a way to escape poverty. Ironically as we see from question to question as the film is done in flashback Jamal reflects on his harsh upbringing and dangerous street days of dealing with thugs as it's many of these experiences that helped him obtain powerful culture knowledge. And oddly enough many of these questions can be answered by his knowledge he picked up from the past.As in life the film proves many simply have a destiny often expected or unexpected as in the end Jamal knows his destiny and the only way that he will establish love with Latika is thru this game show! This may seem like a fairy tale ending to some still it shows destiny is often meant even though it takes many strange paths for some it's those like Jamal that struggle thru a harsh upbringing and that living in slum conditions makes a man stronger especially mentally. And in the end this makes him a master because he's found his destiny. Super work from Danny Boyle proving no matter how tough and harsh life can be for some it can end striking the jackpot.",Slumdog Millionaire

41,sddavis63,A Creative Story Of Destiny Being Fulfilled,7,22 March 2009,"I found the biggest (and, for that matter, perhaps the only) problem with this movie was the opening 10-15 minutes. We're immediately confronted by young Jamal being tortured in a local police station. The purpose of the torture isn't entirely clear, but as those opening minutes gradually unfold we discover that he's been accused of fraud, after authorities believe he cheated to win 20 million rupees in the Indian version of ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"" - their suspicions backed apparently entirely by the belief that a lower class person such as Jamal couldn't possibly have enough knowledge to have answered all the questions! I found the opening strange, to be honest, and it didn't pull me in - but here's where I have to give the movie credit. When a movie loses me off the top I usually don't get back into it. ""Slumdog Millionaire"" accomplished that. Once the story really got going I was impressed by the creativity involved. Basically the plot follows the ""Millionaire"" episode Jamal was on question by question, explaining how he could know the answers by telling us of his background. That was a very imaginative plot device, and the account of Jamal's background was stunning - it portrayed a gripping account of India's poverty-stricken lower classes, and a real study of love and commitment as we follow Jamal, Lakita and Salim through their adventures. Director Danny Boyle deserves credit for creating such a believable picture of Mumbai, and one is truly drawn into wanting to discover the fate of Lakita. In the end, this becomes a love story - a story of destiny being fulfilled in spite of all the odds that seemed to be stacked against it. I wouldn't personally place this on the heights that some have assigned it to, but would still highly recommend it as a very good movie indeed.",Slumdog Millionaire
42,Buddy-51,enjoyable if occasionally outlandish melodrama,8,14 June 2009,"Winner of eight Academy Awards, including one for Best Picture of 2008, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is like a Charles Dickens story updated to the techno-savvy 21st Century. The movie focuses on a trio of impoverished orphans living and loving and contending with a slew of heartless villains in the slums of Mumbai, India. Jamal, his older brother, Salim, and their compatriot, Latika, a young girl they take under their wing, undergo enormous trials and tribulations as they struggle to survive in a world that has pretty much abandoned them to the vagaries of fate. In true Dickensian fashion, the story also provides generous doses of melodrama, implausible coincidences, hairbreadth escapes and heart-tugging sentimentality to help mitigate the suffering.Based on the novel ""Q & A"" by Vikas Swarup, the movie starts off with a now 18-year-old Jamal being interrogated - and, indeed, tortured - by the Indian authorities who don't believe that an ordinary kid from the slums could be racking up so much money as a contestant on ""Who Wants to Be A Millionaire?"" (he's fast approaching the 20,000,000 rupee mark) without somehow cheating. With this unlikely but clever narrative device serving as a framework, the movie then travels back in time to show the skeptical police investigator just how it is that Jamal does indeed happen to know the answers to all those questions.Written by Simon Beaufoy and co-directed by Loveleen Tandan and Danny Boyle (""Trainspotting,"" ""28 Days Later""), ""Slumdog Millionaire"" somehow manages to push the envelope in the areas of plausibility and credibility without sacrificing its authenticity in the process. One moment it may be being brutally honest in its depiction of the effects of grinding poverty and cruelty on the human body and spirit - and the next it's indulging in the veriest of feel-good fantasies, as Jamal stands on the brink of the ultimate rags-to-riches fable, getting both the money and the girl, in the best Horatio Algers tradition. Yet, the movie never feels exploitative or compromised as a result of this dichotomy - a dichotomy, in fact, that clearly reflects the Indian culture of both wealth and poverty, traditionalism and modernity from which the story arises.The flashiness of the editing and the liveliness of the directing keep the film hurtling ahead at a breakneck pace, while the cast of mainly amateur actors - playing the children at various ages - engages our sympathy from the outset. Dev Patel and the gorgeous Freida Pinto are both splendid as the oldest incarnations of the two main characters. And don't step out before the closing credits, a fun and lively bit of Bollywood hoopla designed to send audiences out of the theater with a spring in their steps and a smile on their faces - a smile that is well and honestly earned, I must say.",Slumdog Millionaire
43,Lejink,Who wants to see a great movie?,8,7 February 2009,"There's a real buzz about this unlikely Oscar contender but it's fully merited. Danny Boyle's off-beat parable, with at its centre, the unlikely premise that a poor young ""phone-basher"" (call centre worker) could win the Indian version of ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"" grips the viewer immediately and conveys a marvellous episodic story, leaving some indelible images along the way.With a start that reminded me of the similar-territory Oscar-winning ""City of God"", we are quickly introduced to the three main characters in their infancy Salim, the (street)-smarter, often crueler older brother, Jamil, the trusting, caring younger brother and Latika, the pretty young girl who crosses their path looking for shelter from the storm, just when they're all made orphans. From there, we're taken on the hugely entertaining journey through their lives as their paths criss-cross to a background of poverty, criminality and cruelty before we reach the deserved ""happy-ending"" as Jamil and Latika finally come together.Boyle also makes India the star of the movie but not the ""Bollywood"" version, (although I loved too the Bollywood concession over the final credits). Here, right from the start, we're landed in a grindingly poor ""shantytown"" with piles of rubbish everywhere, are then moved into the shockingly cruel world of procured child-beggaring (where in a no-pun intended, twist on the enduring image of Fagin and Oliver, adult criminals think nothing of blinding young children to bring in more money from donors), graduating finally to adult crime with Salim's employment as hit man and Latika as in-house concubine to the same Mr Big gangster.The film is unusually constructed - just who is interrogating Jamil over his win and why it's not revealed until the plot is well advanced (and the answer is surprising too!) and the coincidental reason (""It is written"") that this young man can answer all the questions on his way to the last question is cleverly fed to the audience as the movie progresses.The young actors are all terrific, each character goes through three stages as they grow to maturity and all nine are convincing. Director Boyle intersperses his rollicking story with myriad unforgettable images, (the early airborne shots of the shantytown village, Jamil emerging from (let's be polite) a dung-heap to claim the autograph of his Bollywood idol, young Latika standing outside in the rain, I could go on and on - realising these images are all from only the first 20 minutes. There's plenty of earthy humour too (plus, being Scottish, I laughed out loud at the call-centre interview with the ""wifie"" from Kingussie - I've had that conversation, as I'm sure has director Boyle!) to leaven the toughness and severity of what surrounds it and of course a genuinely gripping climax too as Jamil, now a symbol of hope to the whole country gets asked the big question, that properly takes us back to the start as this story of our three young musketeers, although not without cost, is brought to a proper conclusion.A wonderful film, I'm still recalling other scenes, images and laughs even as I finish this. Do yourself a favour, ignore everything else at your local cinema and go see this.",Slumdog Millionaire
44,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Average enough, but a bit mis-sold as a ""feel good"" film",7,22 June 2009,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Slumdog Millionaire is not a conventional 'rags to riches' film. That is, to say, it's not a rags to riches story told in a conventional way. It doesn't play out like the sort of heart warming family tale that you could sit down and enjoy your Sunday roast with that the genre is famous for following the convention of. Indeed, it feels a tad mis-sold with the front cover loudly proclaiming it 'a feel good film.' Instead, it unflinchingly takes us feet first into the cold and unfeeling world of the poverty and desperation of the slums of India that are as awful as those in, say, Jamaica. It's strange as India does statistically have a stronger economy than the UK, not to mention being much bigger than us, yet it's still known as 'a poor country.' And Indians do have a reputation as quite affable, gentle people. Yet SM shows us some of the more unsavoury ones who are truly rotten eggs. Which brings us onto another downbeat aspect of the film, in the shape of a truly unsettling scene involving a child being blinded so more pity will be taken on him as a beggar. It takes a nasty jolt like this to wake us up to the true human cost going on behind the poorness and despair, and the parasitic exploitation that festers behind it.Indeed, The News of the World ran the story of how the child stars were made to return to their lives of poverty after the film enjoyed Oscar night and how the father of one of them was even driven to sell them so she could have a better life. There is poverty in the UK, but I can't imagine a situation where a child would be sold out of poverty. All in all, the film serves as a depressing eye opener to the unseen world of India and you come away with less of an impression of having seen a 'feel good' film and indeed actually having seen quite a downbeat and disturbing one. That's not to say it doesn't have it's more positive moments or that it's any less involving, just you go in for one thing and come out with something a bit different. And that never works for me. ***",Slumdog Millionaire
45,ElMaruecan82,"Question 1. How was ""Slumdog Millionaire"" ruined by the last ten minutes ?",6,12 January 2011,"ANSWER A. Jamel's final won wasn't destiny, it was pure luck, which was in total contradiction with the message of the film.------------------------------------------------------ ---------------------------------- ------------------------------------The structure of ""Slumdog Millionnaire""'s script was based on a simple premise : Jamal, a slum boy wins in the ""Who Wants to be a Millionnaire"" game because every question has a connection with something that happened in his life. Original and clever, this was the basis of the film : Jamal's destiny was to win, because his destiny made him know all the answers. It's never been luck. Even at the 50-50 question, when the TV host gives him the wrong answer in the toilet, he's indirectly guiding Jamal who naturally chose the other option because he learned from his past not to trust anyone. Everything had a connection with his life. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying Jamal shouldn't have given the right answer, but the way he did betrayed the spirit of the film. Jamal says ""Answer A"" and then ""A"" rhymes with Deus Ex Machina.* Some would say : ""that was the point, he didn't care about winning, he knew Latika would be with him from that day and that's what mattered to him. He had the love of his life, he didn't care for money"" Then, let's go to Answer B.ANSWER B. Because Latika was the most important thing, Jamal shouldn't have won the game. ----------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------- He loved Latika, he played the game to be rich enough to provide a good living for the love of his life. BUT Latika didn't care : remember, she came at the rendezvous in the train station. She loved Jamel, rich or poor. Now, let's say the game was important, because it was the only way so Latika could reach Jamal, as long as she escapes from the house. I accept the idea of Salim (the brother) deciding to free Latika as a redeeming act. Then, all she has to do is to find Jamal. Then Latika sees Jamal on TV, she remembers about the cell-phone, she answers, she declares her love, BUT Jamel gives the wrong answer. The movie needed a happy ending, but Jamal with Latika was the perfect happy ending. And it would have been a legendary twist ending, everybody expect Jamal to win, but he doesn't, he only wins Latika's heart, THAT'S a beautiful and modern fairy tale. To give you an example, Jamal having Latika AND the money felt like a forced artificial ending, like Rocky Balboa winning the fight against Apollo. All Rocky wanted to do was to go the distance. All Jamal wanted was Latika.* Some would say ""It was Jamal's destiny to win, the whole point was that he had to go from wags to riches, people wanted an underdog story"" Then, let's go to Answer C.ANSWER C. Latika should have been the one who gave him the right answer. ---------------------------------------------- --------------------------------Think about it, every protagonist in Jamal's life played a big role in his knowledge of the right answers, Salim for the ""Colt"", the poor blind kid for ""Benjamin Franklyn"", his mother for the Hindu question etc. Imagine if Latika knew about the answer, how magical it would have been : the most important question of the game, and he knows the answer thanks to Latika. Imagine how the climactic scene would have been even more thrilling, she hears the phone ringing on TV, she realizes she left it in the car then we would have been like ""Faster, Latika!"" What a hell of a climax if we knew she knew the right answer, making Jamal rich and still having the opportunity to say ""I love you""* But the point is that they never knew the answer, how could Latika know?That's simple, she was in a crowded street, full of thousands of people, she could have heard anyone say ""Answer A"" : that would have been simple, plausible, and leading to a more brilliant climax. Instead, she just says ""I don't know"", and Jamel who doesn't even care still gives the right answer! Anticlimactic, yes, ironic, maybe, but don't start with the whole 'destiny' thing, if it was Jamal's destiny to win, then every single thing that took part in his life would have helped him to know the answer. And in that last case, it would have been Latika's intervention. Isn't she part of Jamal's destiny after all. Instead of that, Jamal had the money and the girl, and the whole celebration thing.* Some would say ""that's what people wanted, he had the girl and the money, it had to be a happy ending"" Then, let's go to Answer D.ANSWER D. Because of the forced stereotypical Bollywood happy ending.-------------------------------------- --------------------------------------That probably explains all the previous criticism. It seemed like Danny Boyle wanted to please the foreign audience, to remind them that they were watching an 'Indian' film. How condescending to support the cliché that any Bollywood film should end with a musical choreography, even for a drama handling very serious subjects. That's how you start a great film with an incredible screenplay, and ruin it with one of the most forced and badly written endings. Maybe the whole stupid choreography at the end was intended to confirm that the movie wasn't to be taken seriously.« Slumdog Millionaire » is the perfect example of a great film ruined by the last ten minutes and inspiring in terms of 'story-revisionism'. The movie had all the elements to be considered one of the greatest of the last decade, all it needed was a good ending. And this is my final answer.",Slumdog Millionaire
46,paul2001sw-1,An Indian fairytale,7,13 April 2010,"Danny Boyle's successful film 'Slumgod Millionaire' is a vibrant tale of life at the sharp end of modern India; but it's also essentially a fairytale, with a happy ending and details that don't quite ring true. Most notably, it's based around the quiz show, 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire?', but it makes the assumption that the programme's makers don't actually want anyone to win, whereas I suspect that in reality, the occasional big winner is exactly what generates most publicity and subsequently revenue for the show. And while I am certain the life of a ""slumdog"" is not in any senses easy, the truth is that millions of Indians live, sadly in poverty, but without constant threat from people trying to kill them. Indeed, to me this felt like an outsider's view of India, and perhaps the films popularity stems from the fact that a global audience can share Boyle's perspective; the novel 'White Tiger' tackled similar themes (and in a similar semi-comic fashion) with more authenticity. Indeed, the dramatic tension of Boyle's film comes more from the quiz show embedded within it than from the thin surrounding plot. It's vivid and entertaining for sure; but aside from 'Trainspotting', I've never been wholly convinced by those who think Boyle a genius; and I wasn't convinced here either.",Slumdog Millionaire
47,dromasca,powerful social melodrama,8,22 May 2009,"I confess that I have too little knowledge about the genuine Indian cinema, and I need to rely on films like this one to understand the culture and the people of the country. Danny Boyle's surprising Oscar blockbuster is a strong and colorful explosion of images of different segments of the Indian society, from the lowest unlucky kids in the slums, born to violence and abuse to the gangsters and nouveaux riches privileged of the developing India of today. Kids abuse, crime, poverty, religious and ethnic tensions, the old and the new India all get their place on screen, and the viewer can feel the rhythms and the immense power of this country even if he never visited it.The structure of the story is inspired by the trivia 'Millionaire' TV show, the main hero being a semi-an-alphabet tea boy in Mumbay who reaches to the almost final win stage raising the suspicions of the police. Under a harsh interrogation he starts revealing the secret of his matching answers - all questions relate one way or another with experiences of his life. It's a little bit like the Forrest Gump hero connected to all important events of the American history of the second half of the 20th century. Here it is his own life, a life of violence and tragedy that seems to fit with the show questions and provide him all answers. One can interpret this as a fine saying about the relationship between popular television and life, but this is not the focus of the film. The biography of the superbly acted hero feeds the colorful and realistic rendition of the Indian landscape presented through the eyes of kids unhappy by birth and destiny and filmed with pace and non-hesitating realism, sustaining the interest for most of the film.It is the final part that changes the tone and turns the movie into melodrama and romantic story. I have mixed feelings about this change of tone, including the finale which makes a deep reverence to the Bollywood style. On one hand the director seems to give up to the cruel and dark vision that dominates the first part of the film. He seems to have feared that if the register stayed there we would have got 'just' a strong and violent social drama, lacking too much the human dimension. With the romantic component controlling the final part of the film the whole message looks different, the film is closer to popular entertainment, and even the TV trivia game ends by being seen from a different perspective. The success of the film is no doubt due to this change of register in the final quarter of the screening time. Maybe all successful films (and certainly these who aim to wining Oscar awards) need a certain dose of melodrama. Due to this final the film achieved success, but I am not convinced that it really got better.",Slumdog Millionaire

54,inkblot11,"A cinematic plum, is Slumdog M....you will be overwhelmed by the power and beauty of this tale",10,18 January 2009,"Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) is being beaten, and more, by the Indian police. This is because he has been winning on the Indian game show, Who wants to be a millionaire, and they suspect he is cheating. But, when the chief really begins to listen to Jamal's life story, he starts to realize that the young man has not cheated. From an early age, Jamal has risen out of absolute misery to make it to the final questions on the show. As children, he and his slightly older brother, Salim, had to run and hide from the police, if they were caught playing in the wrong city place. Their mutual love for a minor film star provided Jamal with the ability to correctly identify one of M's beginning questions. Then, they lost their mother, brutally, to an ethnic cleansing but the apparel of the attackers aided Jamal in answering another of the show's queries. And, so it continued, throughout the brothers survival in life, from their time as members of a beggars group, run by unbelievably cruel Hindi-Fagins, to their pickup jobs near the Taj Mahal, etc. The brothers were joined by a beautiful girl orphan, Latika, for a time but Salim took her away from Jamal, for a spell. But, Jamal's life journey has, miraculously, provided him with the responses he needs to ""win"" a million. Will he, ultimately, succeed, or will he go away with nothing? This is a brief, sketchy report on a plum of a film. Slumdog is ingenious and brilliant and touching, in the extreme. To see this unbelievable tale of the triumph of the human spirit, under extremely challenging circumstances, is the ultimate in the ""feeling great"" category of cinematic experience. As Jamal, Patel excels in his role as the most under of ""underdogs"" who, nevertheless, rises to amazing heights. All of the other cast members are likewise terrific, from the woman playing Latika, to the television host, and, especially, to the gentleman taking on the very difficult role of Salim. Needless to say, the scenery is a mixture of the sights of India's great beauty and its abject, abysmal poverty. Production values for the film are also great, while the story and direction are flawlessly well-conceived and executed. In summary, do not delay in making time for Slumdog M. It is a perfect plum of a film and everyone will feel like a ""million bucks"" when it reaches its triumphant conclusion.",Slumdog Millionaire
55,tabuno,"Even With Its Weaknesses, This Movie Was Moving and Inspiring",8,20 January 2019,"30 January 2009. It's hard not to admit that ""Slumdog Millionaire"" can grow on some people. Even with its irritating, jarring, and perhaps unnecessary flashback approach along with underdeveloped characters and subtext, this movie remains riveting, emotionally satisfying, gritty, and overall well-executed. The music stands out as a fantastic spicy flavor of energetic and captivating background melodies. The flaws in this movie occur with its confusing opening, its somewhat glossing over a number of the characters only to become stereotypes like the head criminal boss and the show host. There is lost motivational and background material on most of the characters, they're feelings, thoughts for their actions as they changed over time. Where and why would anybody and how could somebody give $100 to a blind boy? Where does a gun just come from? There are a number of fascinating cultural topics that are assumed or just overlooked and given a fast go-over, the caste system for example is thrown into the movie graphically, but never really explored in depth. A linear chronological presentation may have been a better approach as well as the ""gimmick"" of a game show may not have really been necessary to really bring this movie into classic fruition. For such flaws, this movie may not been classic status, but it remains an compelling and engrossing movie nonetheless. 8/10.",Slumdog Millionaire

The preposterous notion that a game show contestant suspected of cheating would be tortured by the police is an insult to India. A competent director may have overcome the shortcomings of the script, but Boyle is obsessed with his distracting visual style (tilted camera, fast inter-cutting, excessive closeups) at the expense of story and character development and acting. His over-indulgent style is better suited to music videos. Also, as with his earlier ""Trainspotting,"" this one features a revolting toilet scene. What's with that?",Slumdog Millionaire

59,Dr_Coulardeau,The future is coming,10,25 January 2009,"America, I mean the United States of America are changing sides, from Hollywood to Bollywood. They have to answer that unfair competition from the deprived Indians and go directly on their turf, since we can't really speak of a lawn, and bring the biblical truth to those pagans. That's what I found most fascinating at first: the image of the USA seen through the filter of Mumbai. First, make some simple questions fuzzy and difficult to capture. Moslems and Hindus are sure there but we don't know who is who. They speak the same language. No more difference really between Urdu and Hindi. Only the names of the main characters sound Moslem, that's all and the anti-Moslem pogrom or riot is just an unclear detail, especially since the dregs of this society are them, the Moslems. First serious blurred issue. The second is of course the problem of the Untouchables, the Dalits. They cannot be Moslems since they are a Hindu caste. And sure enough our characters who are living in the ""slums"" or shantytown, on the pile of garbage, are not Hindus, hence are not Untouchables. Then we are surprised because taking care of toilets is one of the tasks of these untouchables, or doing the washing for the fortunate who can afford that kind of service. So where are they? Invisible of course, but not in a city like Mumbai where there must be several millions of them. The episode of the little kid jumping into the toilet hole is just unthinkable for a Moslem child. If we go on with that fuzziness, we find out that the orphanage must be on the side of evil, since exploiting the Moslem orphans, hence Hindu. And the gangster who recuperates one of the boys when they are running away from the orphanage people after saving the girl and killing the main organizer of that begging and whoring ring, since he defines himself as the friend of the enemy of his enemies, must be Moslem. All that is unclear and that is done on purpose and it keeps some ambiguity about the Moslems in India without giving the slightest real knowledge about the real situation in India. But then of course we can speak of India itself and of its emergence from the mud-pit of the world. The picture that is given there is this time a reflection of and on what the West was fifty years ago, and some will say still are. Anything is good for these super poor people to do something to improve their lot, essentially by using any kind of opportunity that comes along that is half honest and half dishonest, like borrowing something that has been left somewhere like shoes at the entrance of a temple, but with the firm intention of not bringing them back and of making them circulate further for a little profit. This great poverty is not at all nurturing resignation but all the opposite, determination and the will to gamble everything to get up at least one step if not two. The film is entirely centered on a TV game, Questions and Answers that can lead the winner to 20 million Rupees. A game of punctual knowledge for a lot of money and nothing else. And yet out of that game popular fame is produced, the conviction that you can never keep people down longer than they will decide, that the survival instinct is nothing because it leads to killing, but the instinct to improve one's lot is a lot more stronger because it is supposed to lead to improving your lot in society itself. Then the story is of course a comedy because of the love affair that is intertwined and entangled in that story and the rewriting of Stephen King's ""Running Man"" (with Schwarzenegger) has become pleasant and even funny and not the gruesome drama of the model. The final scene is a typical Bollywood scene with hundreds of actors and actresses dancing in Mumbai's Victoria Station and it is some kind of cherry to top off the ice cream. This film will entertain you deeply if you try to use your brain to see the social discourse that is hiding behind the flashy and colorful surface.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",Slumdog Millionaire
60,zkonedog,Can't Quite Put My Finger On Why It Wasn't Great...,7,12 March 2017,"I just recently finished watching the film sensation of 2008-2009, Slumdog Millionaire, and I wanted to share with you my initial reaction: It was a good film, with a few touching moments, but nothing that will really stick with me long after viewing.I'm not exactly sure why I'm not caught up in the hype surrounding this film (plus its selection for Best Picture at the '09 Academy Awards), but I just don't consider it to be in any way groundbreaking or special. I don't want to steal a thread that has been circulating around the reviews for this product, but it does seem to be a bit contrived in its storytelling method, where a poor contestant on the Indian version of ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"" wows the entire nation with his knowledge of matters that should be beyond him. Over the course of the movie, though, viewers are shown exactly how he came to know the answers to those questions through a series of flashbacks.The film did a good enough job of building suspense that I could give it four stars over three, but I think its biggest downfall was that the central romance of the film was not a little more fleshed out. The romantic angle is supposed to provide the great drama at the end of the film, but instead (at least to me) it fell a bit flat in the notion that there wasn't enough romantic chemistry built up along the way.Thus, while I loved the ""Millionaire"" segments and the ensuing drama that this film created, I felt that the background stories weren't quite compelling enough to turn this film into a classic. However, it is one of those unique movies that a person must see for themselves to make an accurate judgment on, so I would urge you to check it out. You may not LOVE it, but you will almost certainly LIKE it.",Slumdog Millionaire
61,johnnyboyz,"Wonderful and engaging film about an apparent no-hoper breaking through the breach told amidst a canvas of the funny, touching and of the eerie.",8,15 January 2009,"Slumdog Millionaire is a journey; a trip down an individual's memory lane as he recounts the struggles in his life that has, ultimately, given him his opportunity to win big amidst struggles to do with the fact he is suspected of cheating. The film is of the humbling variety, the uplifting and of the downbeat for good measure  chances are you'll laugh; chances are you'll cry and the chances are you'll feel most everything else in-between. English director Danny Boyle has created something that throws just about everything into the mix, but arises as something far, far more than a disposable gimmick. The film's visual approach is one that teeters between the chaotic and the calm, pausing for those tense and dramatic moments of thought and recollection whilst nicely integrating the urgent scenes of chase and memory recollection. The film's pacing and approach is one of a careful nature, one that criss-crosses numerous genres yet remains focused on its study.Boyle identifies the route the film is going to go down in the opening few shots. After an establishment that we are in India, 2006; Boyle presents us with two extremes immediately announcing the overall tone of the film. Jamal Malik (Patel) sits in a chair in an interrogation room and is hit around the face as he is questioned in urgent, close up format. Running parallel with this and in the past tense, he is sitting in another chair  the self-proclaimed 'hotseat' - attempting to win big on India's 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire?' quiz show. Still being grilled and still the central figure of ridicule from the host and the audience, he wades onward.The juxtaposition of being interrogated and electrocuted as a part of that, twinned with the fun; seemingly good natured; rather upbeat and familiar setting of the 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire?' television studio is an instant and sticking one. Boyle manages to get across the range of emotions he'll deliver in the film, often all within a short space of time, as well as establish the manipulation of time that he hopes to accomplish.Needless to say, he achieves it and how. Frequently, there will be passages during which the film will flicker from something quite light hearted to real potential danger and then back again to the television studio as the tension is racked up to do with being the focus of attention. Some incidences include, very early on, when Jamal and some other boys from the slums play cricket on a runway and happily play away despite the immediate danger from landing planes. This activity is then interrupted by hostile guards who pose a new danger but then the kids seem to have fun in escaping.The film is an account, an account of times past by someone who many deem to be in a position they do not feel is possible. The primary theme is underestimation, that a 'slumdog' as Jamal is called, cannot possibly know anything and thus, when he's on the brink of cracking the show's top prize he must've cheated. But the accusers do not know any better. All through Jamal's life, incidences and objects have forced him to pick up on tidbits of trivia that have stuck and on the quiz show, it has aided him in getting as far as he has. The delving into the past as a new question arises consistently offers a refreshing tale within an initially gripping premise. During the film, we learn of his brother and his predicaments as well as the scraps, jobs and potential love interests he finds himself in offering a range: from the humorous, to the touching, to the downright creepy.Jamal sits opposite Prem Kumar (Kapoor), the game's host. They aren't in direct competition despite the banter they share but the study is quite clear and that is to do with what's on the surface and what's below it. Nobody believes a 'slumdog' could get to where they are in the game but through Jamal's accounts, it is possible; whereas Prem comes across as a friendly and upbeat television personality who's game for a laugh although backstage, we see him for what he really is. This is the key distinction between the two and the chief study for these sequences: underestimation and what is on the surface vs. what is below the surface.Although essentially a love story and a film that strongly believes in its themes of fate, the film doesn't concentrate on any particular aspect too much or too little thus creating a mystical aura as all these emotions and events and so forth flash by, dragging you through each of them but always giving you a chance to absorb what's being presented. The liberties to do with the questions being presented to him in the chronological order of his life anyway did not bother me, nor did the fact they paused for a commercial break during a live question. Slumdog Millionaire is effective dramatically and touching at the other times it needs to be; tapping into hope and the errors of people's ways when labelling a certain 'type' of individual. It is certainly worth a look.",Slumdog Millionaire
62,Red-125,Did they see the same movie I saw?,6,27 December 2008,"Slumdog Millionaire, directed by Danny Boyle, is a fairy tale about the obstacles to true love amidst the poverty of India. As I write this review, the movie has an average rating of 8.6, putting it in the top 250 movies of all time. All I can ask is, ""Why?""The movie has its strengths--Dev Patel, the male lead, is a good actor, and Freida Pinto, the female lead, is a beautiful woman who acts well enough. The film shows graphic, repeated images of ghastly poverty. If one picture is worth a thousand words, imagine what this film would be worth.Beyond those positive--or at least valuable--aspects, this film is mainly fantasy, interspersed with scenes of horrible violence, cruelty, and brutal torture.

63,filipemanuelneto,Totally unrealistic and overvalued.,3,23 September 2016,"This film features a less tourist and romantic side of India: a society where traditional social castes are still subject to discrimination, where the immensely rich are very few, and the absolutely miserable are millions. I'm not in India to see if this film shows the reality, in these issue, but it might be close. The two main characters are played by Dev Patel and Freida Pinto (a possible descendant of Portuguese, judging by the family name), and we can say that both are quite reasonable, given the circumstances. However, this film is just that good.To begin, credibility is not the big point of this film, especially for those who do not believe in coincidences. Otherwise, we would never be able to believe in the possibility of a person without instruction win a general culture contest thanks to answers are things that these person was memorizing lifelong, by chance. Nor would believe that one contest normally transmitted deferred would be broadcast live, or that such a popular winner could walk in public immediately after the contest without anyone looking at him more than twice. None of this makes sense, only serves melodramatic purposes, but this is the basis of the film and the script, written by Simon Beaufoy, based on a book I've never read, by Vikas Swarup. This lack of logic fatally victim the main character, despite Patel's efforts to look convincing. His romantic couple seems more consistent, but never ceases to be a highly secondary character.Far-fetched and unrealistic from the beginning to the end, this film is a failure. The way was thinking is too imaginative and bet too much on coincidences. This works with some, but not all audiences. This film does not have the value that most critics gave him, nor deserve Oscars who won. If there is overrated films, this is one.",Slumdog Millionaire
64,howard.schumann,A celebration of life,10,23 November 2008,"Winner of the Audience Award at the Toronto Film Festival, Danny Boyle and Loveleen Tandan's radical Slumdog Millionaire is the feel-good story of an orphaned, street-wise young man trying to make it big on India's version of the TV show ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"" while hoping that the girl he has loved since childhood is watching. Based on the novel Q&A by Vikas Swarup and supported by the stunning cinematography of Anthony Dod Mantle and the music of A.R. Rahman, Slumdog reflects the chaos of Mumbai (formerly Bombay) India where it was filmed. Submerging the viewer in a cacophony of color and sound, the camera swoops and swirls in an often dizzying pace, taking us from the desolation of back alleys and garbage dumps to modern high rises and the fantastic beauty of the Taj Mahal.Boyle uses nine different non-professional actors in three different time frames, each faithfully representing their character as they grow and develop. In the opening scene, the hero Jamal Malik, brilliantly performed by Dev Patel, is being questioned by Police Inspector (Irrfan Khan) who simply cannot understand how a ""slumdog"" like Jamal, without any education, can answer question after question on the game show without lying or cheating. In a city of 13 million people where the police know they can get away with almost anything, the methods of torture used to extract a confession are graphically displayed. With Jamal, however, they only succeed in uncovering the deeper truths of his character as the film flashes back to specific incidents in his life that reveal how his knowledge was gained by personal experience.He knows, for example, that the star of the 1973 film Zanjeer was Amitabh Bachchan because he was his favorite actor as a little boy and was willing to cover himself with filth just to get his autograph. Built on memory, the film relives Jamal's life from the death of his mother to his entry into service to a cynical gangster who turns street children into blind beggars, reminding us of the millions of third-world children, not as lucky as Jamal, who fight against unending poverty each day. Jamal is fortunate to have allies, however: his brother Salim (Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail) and Latika (Rubina Ali), another orphan that Jamal becomes attached to form the ""Three Musketeers"", ready to do battle with the world.Though circumstances lead the three into different areas when they become adults, Salim (Madhur Mittai) into the criminal underworld, Latika (Freida Pinto) to be ""kept"" by a rich man, and Jamal to become a ""chai wallah"", a server of tea to telemarketers, Jamal does not give up, knowing that his life is governed by destiny and ruled by love. Using their wits to survive, the funniest scene is when Jamal and Salim find themselves as tour guides at the Taj Mahal, inventing stories about the history of the building that are probably as true as the official versions in the brochures. The center of the film, however, revolves around Jamal's contesting for millions of rupees on the game show ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"", not necessarily to become rich but to woo Latika whom he knows is a fan of the show.We root for Jamal try to win his jackpot and get his girl. While we are aware that the film is an unlikely fantasy, we also know that as barriers between individuals and nations break down and the world moves toward a greater sense of unity, the distinction between what is possible and what is not is less rigid. Slumdog Millionaire may or may not be the best film of the year, but with headlines telling us daily that the economy is sinking and that climate change threatens our very existence, a film that is a pure celebration of life is welcomed with a grateful heart.",Slumdog Millionaire

There is absolutely nothing wrong with an occasional feel good, happy ending to a movie, especially a movie which is fairly well written n has a good story. Slumdog Millionaire is one of those rare films that comes along every once in a while that is simply breathtaking. At times it is hard to watch the violence towards the children in this film. But a true feel good in the end. Ultimately, the victory that counts is off-screen: it's the artistic triumph of one man, who delivered the feel-good movie of the decade. Best direction by Danny Boyle. Slumdog Millionaire is much better than City of God. The message of grit and hope the movie carries has resonated with the people world over. It gives them the hope that not all is lost, things will become OK if you hang in there. Luck would favor you if you tread the straight path with perseverance. ""Jamal, son is it you? You have my blessings, go win it all"". That poor lady's wishes n prayers really came true.Professional actors always look like they are acting - its just that we get used to it. The people in this film for the most part are not professional actors, especially the kids, but they acted very well. Truly this film is the ""world's first globalised masterpiece"". One of the reasons why this is a feel-good film for me because one cannot help but along the way, rooting for Jamal to succeed. From every point of view, acting, direction, cinematography, music to any little detail of the film you name it, has been worked on almost to perfection, to create refreshing tale of love, betrayal, crime and Destiny.

Danny Boyle knows when to do something memorable.He did it with ""Trainspotting"" in the X-Generation and makes a new landmark film this millennium.""SM"" gave me more than expected and I will try to convince you why this is one of the greatest achievements in recent film history...First, the plot. It gets as simple as describing that a very poor guy that lives on the most disgraceful zone of Mumbai wins the Indian equivalent of ""Who Wants to be a Millonaire?"" but Indian authorities believe he was cheating.How did such a poor and supposedly ignorant boy win a contest of knowledge?. Well, my answer, and without fear of making a mistake, is that destiny and his hard life made him wise. I mean, through many events that dealt with his mother's death, the betrayal of his brother, the loss of his love interest of his life, witnessing crimes (young boys getting their eyes burned, mafia gangs, murders), living in poverty, etc; he stood up his principles and fought back trying to recover his long lost love and build his destiny.There were some haunting moments that will stick for a long time in my mind... plenty of symbolism. First, when Jamal and Malik, after watching their mother being killed, watch a divine appearance from Rham. The Goddess appears on a key moment when religious hatred is happening and changes Jamal's life forever. Jamal later tells that if it wasn't for Rham and Alah, his mother would've never died. That scene was powerful, meant a lot.Then when Jamal and Salim escape Mamann's attacks, when they're leaving on the train they watch poor, invalid, sad Latike in the middle of the mist, night with no apparent future. Then the scene is repeated with M.I.A.'S ""Paper Planes"" song in the background. Excellent moment! Now a classic in my book.Then the ending... The powerful ending. The collage of moments Jamal remembers were extremely moving for my tastes. I mean, when he remembers the big Indian star that gives him the autograph, then when they watch their mother before being killed, then remember himself as a boy, and the most touching, moving scene...remembering Salim smiling next to him.Well, there are MANY more moments that will stay with you for a long time. Also, all the Three Musketeers references were excellent and demonstrate that as a child you can learn a lot in school but it's life that makes you wiser.The directing is excellent. Danny Boyle gives us a fast paced, beautifully shot tale of fantasy and hard moments settled in poor India. The cinematography is just perfect for the movie. Mr. Boyle is a modern director and his techniques are nowhere else to be found. Thank you.The acting is superb. Dave Patel shines through the movie but it's all about the little actors who deliver tender, adorable, and moving performances. The three of them deserve more recognition and more roles. Excellent choice. Freida Pinto is not only super sexy, but she delivers a fine romantic performance. Anil Kapoor delivers a strong but hatred performance. He's an excellent actor. The rest of the cast is strong and believable. Not a conventional Bollywood experience.The soundtrack is just PERFECT. It fits perfectly with the movie's tone and gives a new meaning to Boyle's work. Marvelous combination.Overall, this movie is a modern masterpiece that will stick in your mind. It's a great experience for those who are into Boyle's work and for those who are into ""something different"".There is way more to tell about this movie but it would be unfair to spoil it. Please give it a chance and witness why it's the best movie of the year.",Slumdog Millionaire
67,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"""Slumdog"" beautifully bridges life in India and Western film",9,22 December 2008,"It doesn't seem like a stretch to suggest that America might now be ready to embrace films in the style of India's Bollywood films. While ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is far from a Bollywood tragic love story filled with singing and dancing, the way director Danny Boyle will rivet audiences with his film that is authentic to Indian culture while using a distinctly Western style of film-making might be enough proof that there is a profit to be made here.""Slumdog Millionaire"" is a drama exposing the tragic effects of poverty in gigantic Indian cities like Mumbai that is also fused with a modern day Indian fairytale. Jamal Malik is a young man on India's ""Who Wants to Be A Millionaire"" and is a question away from one million dollars when he's arrested on suspicion of cheating. Because Jamal is from the slums of India and has no educational background, it seems entirely improbable if not impossible that Jamal could make it this far, but each question is connected with distinct and sometimes painful memories for Jamal. It's as if he is destined to win, even though he only went on the show to impress a girl he has loved his whole life, Latika.Danny Boyle (""28 Days Later,"" ""Sunshine"") takes us from memory to memory as Jamal advances question by question toward the million dollars. These memories offer vivid insight into poverty in India as well as the lives of Jamal, Latika and Jamal's older brother Salim. As children they are left parentless and taught how to swindle tourists, leading to lives of little fulfillment or even corruption. Despite being separated, Jamal and Latika are reunited several times and in fact Jamal's only motivation in life is his love for her.While the young, unknown, Indian actors are absolutely amazing in this film, the biggest kudos go to director Boyle, who creates an astonishing film. For Boyle to go from science fiction and zombie thrillers to taking on a project as daring and unusual as ""Slumdog Millionaire"" proves that he's not only a brave director, but a versatile one. His great success with making this film intense, eye-opening and full of heart all at the same time prove that he's also an incredible one. ""Slumdog"" is just the beginning for Boyle who might be one of the most progressive and talented directors working today.It's hard to be completely blown away by a film whose core message is about destiny and leans on the fact that Jamal is simply fated to do this well in explaining what has unfolded, but like any good film ought to, Boyle makes you a fan of the characters and not care as much about the logistics as you might normally do. The fact that this film starts out so dramatic and real makes it hard to embrace the fairytale it blossoms into, but it's the great visual storytelling along the way that makes it so enjoyable. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com/",Slumdog Millionaire
68,Anonymous_Maxine,Mumbai Teen Amazed to Discover Corrupt TV Show.,10,29 January 2009,"There are two completely different story-lines taking place in Slumdog Millionaire, and they take place simultaneously and involve mostly all of the same people. Director Danny Boyle Has woven the stories together with such precision, such seamless skill that it presents an almost impossibly clear picture of this kid's life up to the point where he is a contestant on the Indian version of ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire.""Jamal Malik grew up in a Mumbai slum and has lived a life of of devastating poverty and drastic heartbreak. As a child, he and his brother Salim formed a close friendship with a young girl named Latika, but the happy times they had together ended with a tragic separation that continued for many years. As an 18-year-old young man, Jamal found his way onto the Millionaire program, and a chaotic reunion with his brother and Latika ensued.The sequence of events that led to Jamal's participation on the program and the reasons that he sought to be a contestant in the first place are major plot points that I don't want to reveal, but it seems a little unnecessary to do that anyway. t's nearly impossible to do justice to a movie like this by explaining plot points, so suffice it to say that Slumdog Millionaire is the intricate work of a master director at the top of his form.He has created a story of ordinary people living in terrible poverty and extraordinary situations. There are no caricatures in the movie, every character is developed with such clarity that it's almost impossible to determine who the good guys and bad guys are because we understand how every character has come to be the person that he or she is.The movie is told in a wildly unchronological order. The timelines are so mixed and blended that it is a spectacular feat in itself that Boyle has managed to craft such a compelling story and that it never becomes confusing. Many people were confused by Christopher Nolan's brilliant film Memento for much the same reason, and while I can't understand much criticism of that movie, I don't think Slumdog Millionaire will receive many of those kinds of complaints. Jumps back and forth in time and from one simultaneous story to another with such ease that it all feels completely natural.It has been said that Danny Boyle has reinvented the crowdpleaser with Slumdog Millionaire, which is a pretty apt statement. It never once panders to anyone, it never compromises its integrity with weak, sugary plot developments, it doesn't even appear to have any influence whatsoever of the Hollywood machine. There is terrific payoff at various times, intertwined with heartbreaking disappointment and struggles. But probably best of all, it provides astonishing insight into the lives of the Indian people.Jamal's young life took place in an slum of such complete destitution that the people almost seemed not to realize it was happening. The people are filthy poor, but its all they've ever known, and the way the kids play with such glee, it makes us understand that they don't view their lifestyle with the same understanding audience that those of us on the outside would.For the full effect, Boyle juxtaposes this level of existence with the polished world of a successful television show, hosted by a man who is so incapable of accepting that a kid who came from this background could possibly know the answers to his questions. In fact, possibly the film's only real weakness, the thing that will be difficult for us to believe, is that every question asked by the show happens to coincide with remarkable accuracy to some traumatic incident in Jamal's life.But that is a good part of the movie's message, as well. About 70% of India's population, which I believe is nearly 1.2 billion people, live in small, poor villages, probably not terribly unlike the one where Jamal and Samir and Latika grew up. Slumdog Millionaire is the story of one kid from one of those villages for whom, after a childhood of unbroken poverty and beggary, all of the stars finally aligned.",Slumdog Millionaire
69,jzappa,Bollywood Dickens,7,7 January 2009,"Like 2007's Juno, Slumdog Millionaire is essentially a feel-good film by a good director that is given much more credit than is due. Juno was cute like an emasculated Wes Anderson film. Slumdog is like modern live-action Disney film in spite of its violence, which hardly rivals what Disney films have been doing recently. This fictional biography is based entirely upon deus ex machina. It is concerned with building a harmonious world founded on the marble floors of dreamy ideologies and sated with a pleasant, immediately gratifying style.Danny Boyle's $15 million Hindi fairy tale radiates with the feeling of a call to action. This is a breathlessly paced film, moving all around the emotional map, about a Mumbai orphan who emerges from the slums on the might of his sparkling ability to retain minutiae. The story's shy, pure and heroic protagonist reaches remarkable, vindicating heights merely with the mental and social experience of being a slumdog. He is a beacon of idealism for the hopeful masses. What I admire objectively is that this hyperkinetic melodrama's general allure will acquaint millions of moviegoers with the real India for the first time.We react to the tragedy of the India of social classes that appear as if to be estranged by dimensions. A woman crawls from a cardboard box. Men bathe at a fire hydrant. People excrete waste on the sidewalk. On the other hand, the world's largest middle class, mostly lower-middle, but all the more highly regarded. Millionaires. Mercedes-Benzes and Audis. Luxury condos. Education is bursting at the seams. A thriving computer section. A cascade of doctors and neurosurgeons.Complete with a musical sequence at the end, but also an early scene of electric shock torture, Boyle's rags-to-riches tale balances these two Indias by cutting between a hell of destitution and predation and the Indian version of Who Wants to be a Millionaire. It tells the story of an orphan from the slums of Mumbai who is born into a brutal existence. A petty thief, impostor and survivor, mired in dire poverty, he improvises his way up through the world and remembers everything he has learned. He finds a small place in the Mumbai gangland, and even falls in idealized love with a girl who keeps eluding him.Sort of an Indian City of God, the film's flashback storytelling follows his life until his appearance as the show contestant. At the point in his life where he is a contestant on the show, the film takes on a Bollywood-laced magical prestige. Proposed as a ""slumdog,"" he gives the correct answer to question after question and becomes a nationalized idol to audiences who are watching the show live. The flashbacks show the experiences through which he happened to pick up the observations that are now winning him millions of dollars. He doesn't volunteer this astonishing information. The film opens as it's beaten out of him by the show's sweaty, violent security staff. They are convinced he must have stolen the answers.This crowd-pleaser, scripted with a brisk pace by Simon Beaufoy, uses attention-grabbing cinematography by Boyle's regular DP Anthony Dod Mantle, Chris Dickens's machine-gun- speed editing, and Boyle's trademark energized, driving, uber-modern soundtrack. One could expect from that description a gimmicky film directed by an insecure show-off. But Danny Boyle is one director whose films are made in that style and yet, like a more diplomatic Spike Lee, our abstract familiarity with delight and social ecstasy are stimulated by his work, even by his lesser films such as The Beach and A Life Less Ordinary. Slumdog Millionaire has no underpinnings beneath the marble floors of dreamy ideologies and immediately gratifying style, but I can't deny that it does have that Danny Boyle touch.",Slumdog Millionaire
70,Turfseer,Cheesy Bollywood-like Production Still Entertains!,6,27 November 2008,"Slumdog Millionaire chronicles the odyssey of Jamal Malik from the slums of Bombay to now modern Mumbai. The film's framing device is Malik's attempt to win the Hindi version of ""Who wants to be a Millionaire"". He ends up answering each question correctly and a day before he attempts to answer the final question for the grand prize, he's whisked away by the police on suspicion of fraud. The police want to know how a kid from the slums could possibly answer all those questions correctly. As they question him (sometimes using torture at first), the viewer is treated to a series of flashbacks which explains how he's able to successfully answer each question.The first half of the movie (the much better part) involves Malik first as a young child (of about five) and later at about the age of 10 (played by two different child actors). Malik's older brother, Salim, is the more aggressive of the two, in contrast to the sensitive younger brother. We see how they are orphaned at an early age when their mother is killed during a riot where Hindus attack Muslims. The children must fend for themselves in the slums of Bombay and there are many memorable and shocking scenes that chronicle their tactics of survival. One indelible scene involves Malik securing an autograph from a famous Indian singer who is on a publicity tour in the area. Malik extricates himself from inside a locked latrine and appears at the autograph signing covered head to toe in human excrement. Eventually Malik and Salim are lured by a gang of criminals who end up training them to become professional beggars. The gang goes so far as to increasing their profits by blinding certain children who have sweet singing voices. The blind children are used by the criminals to manipulate unsuspecting tourists who feel sorry for the now handicapped children. Salim alerts Malik to the gang's nefarious plan and they escape along with another child, Latika who Malik falls in love with.At the midpoint of the film, with Salim now a young teenager, he takes revenge on head of the gang who almost blinded Malik by shooting him to death. But Salim incurs Malik's enmity by raping Latika. Flash forward to the present as we find Malik working at a menial job as a gopher at a large international customer service company. Malik eventually locates Salim who is now working for the boss of Mumbai's biggest crime syndicate. And he finds out that Latika is basically an indentured servant in the boss's mansion. In the film's climax, the police release Malik who goes on to answer the final question correctly and hooks back up with Latika who escapes the crime boss's lair (with the help of Salim, who, in a final act of contrition, sacrifices himself by murdering the crime boss and in turn is killed by the boss's bodyguards). Slumdog Millionaire has a lot going for it. It's highly entertaining and features some great performances (especially by the child actors in the first half). Dev Patel as Malik is also excellent as the low-key hero who eventually gets the girl. The passionate conflict between the two brothers adds to the verisimilitude of the story.Slumdog is really designed to be a gritty fairy tale. But even fairy tales must have some kind of internal logic. The weakest part of the story for me was the whole idea that the producer of the 'Millionaire' show was some kind of crook who wanted to fix things so Malik would lose. And was it at all believable, that Malik, who had become a national hero, would suddenly be brought in by the police and tortured merely because they could not believe a kid from the slums could answer such the tough questions on the show? In reality, the police would never have chanced abducting Malik while the show was going on and risk losing their jobs due to possible adverse press coverage. And why would the producer of the show want Malik to lose? If he wins, the producer's ratings go much higher and he makes more money.Slumdog also stumbles by becoming a Bollywood production in the second half. The villain in the first half, the child exploiter is much more believable and menacing than the crime syndicate boss in the second half. And Latika is wholly an underdeveloped character—she has nothing much to do except being the love object of Malik.I'm not sure if Slumdog Millionaire deserves to be nominated for an Academy best picture. But as a solid piece of entertainment, it will keep you riveted in your seat.",Slumdog Millionaire
71,Chris Knipp,Horatio Alger in Mombai,9,18 November 2008,"An exhilarating entertainment, an adrenalin rush, and a non-stop two-hour blast of colorful image and sound, Danny Boyle's 'Slumdog Millionaire' is a feel- good fairy tale but also a rough guide to the Dickensian low life/high life contrasts of modern Bombay/Mombai. In the story, by a fluke 18-year-old ""chai-wallah"" Jamal (Dev Patel) has gotten onto India's version of ""I Want to Be a Millionaire."" He's been delivering chai around the offices of the TV station and they've discovered he's smart. He's been winning hugely as the contestant and has reached the 20 million rupee mark when, right as the movie begins, he's jerked out of the TV studio to be interrogated and tortured by the police because they think a ghetto kid would have to cheat to get those answers right.The interrogation becomes a frame-tale worthy of the ""Arabian Nights,"" because each of Jamal's explanations of how he knew the answer to a particular ""Millionaire"" question takes the form of a hyper-kinetic flashback to yet another exciting, heart-stopping moment of his tumultuous emotional roller-coaster slumdog life. Fast-paced, fluent editing integrates sequences of Jamal's TV show performance, the police interrogation, and his recollections to explain how he knew a particular answer. It's a juggling act that never falters, and the high-energy film-making ensures that all three settings are consistently exciting and suspenseful. Every childhood reminiscence is a shocker, a tearjerker, and a cliff-hanger as Jamal strives to survive poverty and exploitation and unite with his childhood beloved. We don't know how the interrogation's going to wind up. And most exciting of all, the whole country is waiting to see if Jamal, the poor boy making good, will win the big jackpot or sink back into poverty, and we don't know how that's going to end.Eschewing the machinery of the huge city's Bollywood studios (though utilizing several of its stars), Danny Boyle and his Hindi-language co-director Loveleen Tandan took lightweight digital cameras directly into Mombai's side streets and ghettos and worked with non-actors to portray the young life of Jamal.When accused by the police of cheating, Jamal sullenly replies that he simply ""knew the answers."" As we see the questions actually being posed during the show, Jamal is cool, rather dazed, in front of the boisterous TV audience, being played and teased by ""Millionaire"" show host Prem (Anil Kapoor, one of several big Indian stars in the film), yet coming up with the right answer. Then the scene shifts to a flashback of an anti-Muslim mob that slaughters Jamal's mother. Jamal and his brother Salim must flee and live on the streets by hustling and stealing. They take on the pretty Latika as a partner, who becomes the love of Jamal's life. At one phase they're kidnapped by the evil, Fagin-like Maman (Ankur Vikal), who makes them think they're at a spa for poor kids and then puts out his little captives' eyes and trains them to be street singers (the blind ones make more money). Jamal and Salim escape by hopping a train but lose Latika. Later the boys steal shoes from tourists visiting the Taj Mahal and sell them in a street market, and they act as charming but uninformed guides while allowing their host's cars to be stripped by pals. Eventually Jamal is betrayed by Salim, who's always cheated him and turns into a criminal.'Slumdog Millionaire' is like an animated history of John Locke's theories of memory. Every recollection contains the answer to a question in the show as a fact engraved on Jamal's brain by the power of the accompanying joy or trauma he was experiencing when he learned it. In the later phases of Jamal's story, he tracks down Latika, finding her beauty being exploited in a low-life activity, and in seeking her, he runs back into Salim, whom he remains linked to, but cannot forgive. Eventually everything gets resolved appropriately and the ending is happy, with Jamal and the now gorgeous Latika (Freida Pinto) united in a kiss. The closing credits boldly flaunt the film's unreality as the principals and a host of extras do a light-hearted dance in the Mombai train station.'Slumdog Millionaire'' tells a story more notable for its ingenuity than its verisimilitude, but there's a tumultuous reality about it nonetheless. It can be admired--not to say loved--on many levels, and seems likely to stand as one of the year's best films. There are dozens of good actors. Superstar Irfan Khan (whom Americans have seen in 'The Namesake,' A Mighty Heart,' and 'The Darjeeling Limited') adds inestimable subtlety and warmth to the role of the police inspector. Anil Kapoor is vivid as the show host--and the film is highly successful at capturing the drama and suspense of ""Millionaire"" shows. Dev Patel, actually English-born (only the young Jamal actors speak Hindi), was a star of last year's realistic British comedy series about Bristol teens ""Skins,"" which from all reports is an absolute gem and ought to be seen. Tall and thin, Patel projects a perfect combination for the role of nerdiness and purity, innocence and will-to-succeed. Much credit goes to 'Full Monty' and 'Miss Pettigrew' screenwriter Simon Beaufoy who adapted Vikas Swarup's ingenious novel, 'Q&A.' This is a wonderfully cinematic effort whose essence is its intense visuals by DP Anthony Dod Mantle, coordinated effectively by editor Chris Dickens and underlined by the lively music of A.R. Rahman. Boyle has always gone for the wild stimulus package ('Shallow Grave,' 'Trainspotting') and the exotic adventure ('The Beach,' 'Sunshine'). He's also shown skill at working with children ('Millions') as he does in the many scenes of Jamal's early life here. This is his most intensely sui generis effort. It's one of his greatest successes and a disturbing, thrilling, heart-warming pleasure to watch.",Slumdog Millionaire

74,freemantle_uk,Boyle for the Oscar!,8,25 January 2009,"Before I start, I personally think that Christopher Nolan and the Dark Knight should win the awards for Best Director and Best Film, but since its are not nominated my vote for Best Director is for Danny Boyle, the brilliant director of Trainspotting, 28 Days Later and Sunshine.Slumdog Millionaire has a bit of everything, it has moments of comedy, gangsters, religious tensions and violence and the themes and hope.The basic plot of the film is Jamel (Dev Patel/Ayush Mahesh Khedekar/Tanay Chheda), an 18-year-old call-centre workers from Mumbai and is one question away from winning 20 Million Rupees on India's version of Who Wants to Be A Millionaire. He is arrested and tortured by the police and the film is told in flash backs about how he knew all the answers. It tells how Jamel grew up in Dharavi, the slums of Mumbai where he lives with bullying older brother Salim (Madhur Mittal/Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail/Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala). Their mother is killed during a attack by Hindu extremists because she was Muslim. It tells how they went to an orphanage with Lakita (Freida Pinto/Rubiana Ali/Tanvi Ganesh Lonkar), an orphan girl, which was run by a gangster who used the children to make money. It then shows Jamel and Salim ran away to Dephi and worked at the Taj Mahal in an unofficial capacity. After living as street children Jamel and Salim go back to Mumbai to free Lakita who is trapped with the gangsters. Salim himself ends up as a gangster whilst tries to live a normal life working in the Call Centre.It is the direction which is best element of the film. You get to feel the violence, the tension and the streets. They are great moments within this film, such as during the attack in the slums someone throws a rock at the camera and breaks the lens. I also personally enjoyed Jamel's tour of the Taj Mahal. The acting is good and it is a well written film: Simon Beaufoy has a good shot at best Adapted Screenplay. However, the marketing for Slumdog Millionaire as 'the feel good film of the year' is misleading. It is grim, it is bloody, but it makes the film work. I personally never really like Bollywood film; I find them too cheery and I don't like the singing and dancing in the films. What Boyle did was bring in British Social Realism which I think was needed. I hope more films from India take this approach.Good luck to this film in the BAFTAs and Oscars.",Slumdog Millionaire
75,Polaris_DiB,Uncanny acumen,10,4 January 2009,"Danny Boyle world: a place that's achingly gorgeous, seriously tragic, terrifyingly dangerous, and that I love to visit but have nightmares about living in. While zombies on steroids are attacking people in a poeticly empty London, while astronauts hide from sun-deranged madman, and while kids are trying to do the right thing with money they've stumbled across, down in India an 18 year old kid destroys the caste system while only attempting to get the attention of someone he loves. Sure, Boyle has nothing like a View Askewniverse or anything like that, but all of his movies seem to exist in a space where characters' struggles for survival get second-place for their need to fit in, belong, and justify having hearts. His genre-jumping techniques belie an inimitable style that really makes everything he does worth watching.Slumdog Millionaire is almost like to City of God what 28 Days Later... was to Dawn of the Dead--there are some major parallels both in story and structure, but Boyle's monster eventually takes sway over any comparisons and turns the movie into its own unique journey. Both Slumdog and City of God could have been really shot down critically due to seemingly excessive styles for such non-digital worlds they represent, except that they were so superbly done that you cannot help but fall in love with them. Boyle's acumen is such, though, that he's able to lead you through fear, longing, shock, and grief before taking you to probably the purest of happy endings deftly and articulately, whereas Moreille's City sometimes lost track of the emotional background while playing with its techniques.Everything is in high form here. The script is amazing, creating believable characters and painful dialog while deftly juggling three different points in time until they all arrive in their poignant destination (from the most rote meaning of the word, sharing its roots with Destiny). The acting is superb and it's nearly impossible to see the actors through it, especially when three different kids play the same characters and it's hard not to believe that they weren't really the same person. Danny Boyle gets into Mumbai and other locations in India and shows it from many different perspectives that don't just show what he see's it's like, but represents the characters' vastly chaotic integration into a varied and uncertain world. He also picks out a superb soundtrack capable of both blowing out the speakers with awesomeness and also deftly increasing the drama in the scene--something he does often, but this time is even more worth mentioning because he mixes Indian rhythms with the well-known dramatic digital sounds of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire with an original score, and the mix is seamless.However, technical specifics aside, quite frankly its nearly impossible not to like this movie. Jamal's romantic view of life mixed with already well-ingrained drama of the show, thematic plays with destiny and true-love, an alertness to the troubles of the world without the need to turn the movie into its own sentimental essay, all are powerful ingredients in this concoction. For all the intensely visual play with style and hand-held cameras, Boyle has remarkable reserve in alluding to the passions that drive him but making sure that the story drives the audience. It's actually really uncanny. One of the things that impressed me a lot about 28 Days Later... when I first saw it so many years ago is how even as a good horror movie it managed to both have the ability to make a point without slamming it into people's faces, and to coexist with the perception that there is more to the world than just what's happening to the characters. This approach comes out stronger than ever in Slumdog Millionaire, and as long as Boyle keeps up with it, I will continue to be an avid viewer of his works.--PolarisDiB",Slumdog Millionaire
76,dfranzen70,Well worth the hype,9,14 December 2008,"A young man sits in a chair under bright lights, his face a cypher. He is on the popular Indian game show “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,” and he’s just correctly answered a question worth ten million rupees. As the episode ends - a cliffhanger! - the young man is arrested and taken to police headquarters on charges of cheating in the game. How could a boy from the poorest area of the country do so well on this knowledge show? The tale unfolds under the withering questions by the police inspector. Jamal (Dev Patel) explains how he came to be able to answer the show’s questions by describing his life, from his impoverished beginnings in Mumbai to his involvement with a Fagin-like misanthrope to his stint as an illicit tour guide at the Taj Mahal. Through it all, Jamal’s relationships with the two closest people to him - his brother Salim and their new friend Latika - strongly inform his own decision-making abilities. Jamal’s love for Latika, who we shortly learn is the impetus behind Jamal’s appearing on the game show, and his envy (or fear) of Salim are the crucial cogs in Jamal’s frightening existence.Director Danny Boyle doesn’t just show us the life and times of a poor Indian boy; if anything, that might make the movie more of a maudlin rags-to-riches story. No, this is a romance story, full of passion and undying love. No matter how many times Latika is separated from Jamal - he always finds her again, his heart pounding whenever she is near. It is for her that Jamal is on this game show, and as we learn, he knows the answer to each question he’s been asked because he remembers a specific event in his life on the run that connects him to that question.Jamal’s journey from boyhood to early adulthood is fraught with danger; his mother his bludgeoned to death in front of him by an anti-Muslim mob, and the Fagin-like creep who takes the brothers in does horrible things to boys like them, especially if they can’t carry a tune (and thus make money). But no matter what happens or where he lands in life, his thoughts are first and foremost with the beautiful Latika. Jamal believes it is written that they will be reunited, and because he believes it so strongly, we believe it, too.Hardly a false note is rung in this spellbinding, electrifying movie. Everything feels authentic, not a show staged for the pursuit of Western dollars. (There cast is composed of mostly Indian actors, not ringer Americans with “Indian” accents.) Boyle’s commanding, sure hand tells the dual stories of Jamal’s upbringing and his time on the game show, bringing them both to the same - and powerfully emotional conclusion. Dry eyes are not likely in the final third of this movie.",Slumdog Millionaire
77,PWNYCNY,Has its flaws but nevertheless a very good movie.,8,3 March 2009,"It must be admitted that this is a very good movie. Expecting to find an overrated, over-hyped piece of Hollywood bluster, instead this movie was riveting, evocative, well acted and upbeat. What a relief because whereas usually their is an inverse relationship between hype and artistic quality, here the relation is direct ... for once. The movie deals with a number of themes, poverty, love, crime, child abuse, and has a number of plots which are all woven together to produce a coherent and watchable work of art that restores confidence in the artistic credibility of commercial cinema. Most compelling was the effective use of flashbacks and the portrayal of the main characters as the audience observes their development. Although a high quality movie, it does have its faults. First, there is the scene where Hindus attack Moslems. This scene is entirely outside of the context of the story, more so since religion does not define the characters. Second, the child actors playing the older brother simply were not menacing looking enough to make their performances entirely believable. Third, the Taj Mahal scenes where the audience is supposed to believe in young kids passing themselves off as tourist guides was ludicrous. Fourth, how the main character manages to get onto the game show is not clearly explained. Fifth, by the end of the movie a huge slum had been cleared away with no explanation other than ... ""we used to live there."" Sixth, the questions on the game show were challenging but, considering the sum of money at stake, not overly difficult. Seventh, the use of torture to extract a confession was completely inconsistent with the nature of the alleged crime - cheating on a game show. The show could have told the young man to leave. Yet, despite all these shortcomings, the movie was entertaining, compelling, well acted and deserves praise.",Slumdog Millionaire
78,kevin_robbins,This is a very well made film that I would strongly recommend,10,1 September 2021,"Slumdog Millionaire (2008) is a movie I recently rewatched on Tubi. The storyline follows two brothers and their female best friend, who happens to be the younger brother's love interests, as they grow up in the harsh streets of India. This movie is directed by Danny Boyle (28 Days Later) and stars Dev Patel (Lion), Freida Pinto (Rise of the Planet of the Apes), Irrfan Khan (Jurassic World) and Anil Kapoor (24:India). The storyline for this is awesome and very intricate. The circumstances and script is a healthy mix of hilarious, sad and triumphant. The actors deliver their performances to perfection and I loved every character. Overall this is a very well made film that I would strongly recommend and easily score a 10/10.",Slumdog Millionaire
79,dee.reid,A real treat for anyone who sees it,10,31 March 2009,"""Slumdog Millionaire""This was the true winner of 2008, a true rags-to-riches tale that took everybody by surprise and gained all of the praise and recognition it deserved. It's brilliantly acted, written, and directed by a mostly unknown cast of Indian actors and actresses, and their performances are true-to-life and phenomenal. ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is also one of those rare instances where all the hype and talk of multiple Oscar nods is actually true. And I'm glad I finally got to watch it.The setup is pretty simple: Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) is a ""slumdog,"" a poor, uneducated kid who grew up on the rough streets of Mumbai, India, who by some unbelievable stroke of good luck has managed to land on India's version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire."" However, he is soon arrested and accused of cheating by the show's producers because he knows the correct answers to the seemingly impossible questions that have been stumping scholars for years. The answer is: by sheer coincidence, that is how Jamal knows the answers to these questions. So, desperate to prove his innocence, he relates his life story and experiences, and his life-long quest to find his long-lost true love Latika (Freida Pinto).Directed by Danny Boyle (""Trainspotting,"" ""28 Days Later..."") and adapted from the novel ""Q & A"" by Vikas Swarup, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is that unexpected masterpiece, a true winner in every sense. I had the opportunity to see the movie several weeks ago but due to a shortage of funds at the time (I had just seen ""Watchmen""), I was unable to do so. But this movie pretty much came out of nowhere, and took everybody by surprise because it was the real deal, a real winner, a real underdog story, a real rags-to-riches fantasy come to life. We've read about and seen this sort of stuff in books and movies for years, but it's never been done this good before.""Slumdog Millionaire"" is a movie that deserved each and every one of its eight Oscar wins this year. This film is a real treat for anyone who watches it. Trust me, you won't regret watching it.10/10",Slumdog Millionaire
80,meeza,"Millions will love ""Slumdog Millionaire""",10,13 January 2009,"""Slumdog Millionaire"" is rich with so many magnificent qualities: It is a vibrant, inspiring, and audacious film. And it just might be the apex of cinematic releases for the film year 2008. ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is the story of impoverished Indian teen Jamal Malik's Dickens-like life adventure during his childhood and juvenile years; from his turbulent childhood in India's slums to his destined juvenile experience of being a game show contestant of India's version of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"" Director Danny Boyle does a divine job of orchestrating on how Jamal is able to answer Millionaire questions correctly by Jamal's adventurous ""lifeline"" childhood & youthful slum experiences; the two interrelated juxtaposed narrative structures is the storytelling nature of ""Slumdog Millionaire"". Jamal and his older brother Salim together go through many childhood slum trials & tribulations and evade seizure & mortality in the most unique ways. Salim as he grows older eventually ventures into the bad seed of living a thug life, while genuine Jamal turns the other cheek and is just focused on living a love life. You see Jamal's foremost drive is to reunite with the love of his life Lakita, which he befriended as a child but were separated in a slum escape from some horrific opportunistic criminals. Jamal as a young man does eventually find the beautiful Lakita and is aware that she is an avid fan of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"" Therefore, that is what leads our main slumdog Jamal to the game show experience. India's law enforcement is dubious on how a slumdog like Jamal can answers questions correctly on the game show, so they shake up Jamal a bit. Jamal then has no other choice but to tell his life story to them and fortunately for our cinematic delight to us viewers also. Dev Patel as Jamal was no slum in his motion picture acting debut with his brilliant performance. Anil Kapoor was captivating as Millionaire host Prem Kumar; and the steady veteran Indian actor Irrfan Khan did contribute yet another admirable performance to his underrated acting resume. The drop dead gorgeous Freida Pinto not only paints a pretty picture as an Indian sex symbol but she was also ready as Freddy, I mean Freida, with her thespian contribution to Slumdog. Simon Beaufoy's electric screenplay was one of the year's elite and Simon says ""you best believe that it is a lock for a Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar nomination."" The wondrous cinematography, production design, and editing of ""Slumdog Millionaire"" should also bark up more Oscar nominations on the Slumdoghouse. The celebratory theme song of Slumdog is entitled ""Jai Ho"" which means ""Victory"" in Indian. The rousing ""Jai Ho"" is also worthy of an Oscar jai ho as Best Song. The true hero of ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is Director Danny Boyle for his precise composition of this gem of a film; thank you Danny Boy! How do you say ""Best Director Oscar"" in Indian? Will there be many Jai Ho's for ""Slumdog Millionaire"" come Oscar night? I believe so and that is my final answer! ***** Excellent",Slumdog Millionaire
81,FilmCriticLalitRao,Burden of a white man's false vision about India.,1,9 January 2009,"It is rather bizarre that this inane flick is currently at spot 205 in the IMDb top 250 list. It may be because these days it has become a fashion to trash the strong homogeneous cultures of developing economies. This is the reason why so many films are being made which try to belittle booming economies of Brazil, Russia, China and India. Slumdog Millionaire is one such film which is a half baked attempt to mix realism with social message. It fails on both counts. The biggest fault one can find with Danny Boyle's film is that it looks at poverty, poor kids only from an exploitation angle. This is the reason why so many negative scenes about poverty have been put in order to create a sensationalist approach. This can work wonders for those foreigners who have always looked upon India with their myopic eyes full of contempt. One can be sure that things would have been different if a solution angle had been applied to the film's narrative. The vision of Danny Boyle is so conceited that he feels that ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is his prerogative to suggest that India is nothing but a land of poor people where snake charmers merely rub shoulders with hungry elephants and crime is the only thing which pays. Slumdog Millionaire is a trashy film which will please only those who choose to ignore the real beauty of India. It is a sad fact that Danny Boyle has been able to fool people in the west. His real test will take place when his film is shown in Indian cinema halls where it would surely be trashed as a stupid white man's discriminatory vision of India's misery. It would meet the same fate as that of Mira Nair's ""Salaam Bombay"" when it bombed miserably at Indian box office after being shown for commercial distribution.",Slumdog Millionaire
82,GiraffeDoor,Of course this won best picture...,7,9 September 2019,"Solid, if sentamental little crowd pleaser that oozes so much exotic both the glamour and squalor that it sort of feels like an Indo-aryan Dickens novel with the same substance (NB I'm not that into Dickens).Fun enough and realized with vision and professionalism but that doesn't stop it being rather trite and over long.",Slumdog Millionaire
83,alindsay-al,A fantastic feel good film,9,6 September 2015,"This is one of the most talked about films in recent memory and I think it is fantastic. The premise of the film is that a young Mumbai teen is one question away from winning the jackpot on a game show until he is accused of cheating. To prove his innocence he explains his hard upbringing. Dev Patel plays Jamal the lead, he is an actor I have always liked but he has never been better then this film. He was your true underdog but you connected with his character and you root for him all the way through the film. His romance is also really good in the film and their chemistry works for the film and you are really roofing for these two to succeed. Jamal's brother salim was a really interesting character in the film and even though he is the antagonist I liked his character development. A big shout out has to go out to the young kids in the film as they really do a great job in this film. The story was really interesting, the use if flashbacks gives further development to the characters and really invests you in this underdog story and its romance. The script is OK, there is some dialogue but I guess the overuse of Hindi didn't help at all. Also the script lacks humour quite a bit of the film but the TV parts are written superbly. The style is the best thing about this film. This is one of the best films for its style that I've ever seen. The editing is very fast paced but well done so you know what's going on. Also all the vibrant colours and soundtrack make you feel apart of the world. Overall this is a fantastic movie that deserves all the praise it gets.",Slumdog Millionaire
84,CubsandCulture,"Disturbing subtext aside, this is a real crowd-pleaser...",10,18 February 2019,"The film doesn't really deal with a thorny philosophical issue that is at the heart of its story. I can't think of a way to view this film that isn't forwarding fatalism metaphysically. That being all events are predetermined and inevitable. Jamal knew the answers to all the questions because his life experiences were arranged by fate (or God) so that he would know the answers. This is great for Jamal, for in the end he gets the money and the girl. It is not so great for the kid who has his eyes scooped out by a spoon so Jamal would know the answer to one of the questions. This fatalism is clearly indicated by ""D: it is written..."" at the end and the characters repeatedly talking about destiny. It is simply disturbing to think how many people fate killed so Jamal could win a million bucks and get the girl.Likewise, the film's treatment of India is a little grotesque. The film gives you the false impression that India is all slums, ghettos and crime. The film stomps around troubling aspects of Indian society, such as the sectarian violence between Muslims and Hindus, mainly to provide material for this fairy tale story. In light of it being an British film this is even worse. Likewise, the film really isn't a Bollywood film, for one thing the love story is very Western; it steals, through, some Bollywood things, i.e. the big dance number in the credits (through weirdly it isn't integrated into the text as in Bollywood). The film gives off a vibe of India being mostly used as a setting of ""exotic"" flavor for Western filmgoers.But why am I rating it as a 10? Because the film works! Jamal is a great everyman. The framing of a rag-to-riches story via a game show where the person wins because of their trouble past is innately engaging and engrossing. And the Salim-Jamal are a great pair of brothers to see grow up and the way their fates diverge is emotional.But mostly it is Boyle's visual flare that makes this film. None of the objections to the story occur to you while watching. And boy do you want to start dancing after Jamal wins.Just don't think about the story!",Slumdog Millionaire
85,Chris_Docker,Impressive conjuring tricks from Mr Boyle,8,29 December 2008,"In his most mainstream movie to date, director Danny Boyle successfully transfers Trainspotting's renowned raw realism of economic deprivation to bustling, modern day India. Colourful and ingenious, Slumdog Millionaire adds that pure warmth of the child's smile to the kick of a curry made from a moneylender's intestines, well-laced with raw spirit distilled from fermented slum-dwellers. Rich and poor come together in an orgy of excess, bolstered with a love-song whose words you barely decipher but whose tune stays in your heart. Boyle has been reborn in Mumbai.India is a country of inimitable charm. Yet asked to describe what is good, I am usually stuck for words. It's dirty. Corrupt. Unreliable. Disingenuous. It leeches off you like a starving African stealing food at a Band-Aid concert. Oh, and it stinks. Quite literally.Yet, if you lean your weight against the old buildings near the Taj Mahal, something magical can happen. Somehow it is easy to feel your spirit leave the body. It will flow back through thousands of years of rich and vibrant history. Gandharvas and mythical kings. Back in reality, look up at the monkeys as they scamper across parapets, the sun dazzling you, and Hanuman and Lord Krishna echo from past aeons. Or walk through the mess that is modern Mumbai. Suddenly there's the architectural wonder of the railway station. An incongruently colonial splendour bizarrely appearing in the teeming twenty-first century.Slumdog Millionaire uses the Taj Mahal and Mumbai Station as iconic reference points, rising from the dirt and chaos. Like the boy dressed as Rama, who pops up early in the film. Timeless and almost mythological. But conflict simmers broodingly beneath such visual wonder. Muslim versus Hindu. Strong versus weak. And Slumdog versus Millionaire. Something says the twain ne'er shall meet, so when a kid from the slums succeeds on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, everyone is suspicious.On the other hand, unpredictability is the norm in India. The sense of this is so strong it could almost be described as 'spiritual.' Disconcertingly, it is easy to believe that India is a land where miracles could still occur. Even a child of the slums becoming fabulously rich.The freshness with which Boyle paints the country, the punchy editing and charismatic performances, all conspire against our recognising this is a standard against-all-odds story, a standard rags-to-riches, and a standard do-anything-to-get-the-girl. It is standard pulp. But done so well we barely notice. He has put together a film of surprising maturity, and perhaps his first to win general audiences in a big way. It's a film that uses lessons from Boyle's earlier movies  the gross-out shock value of Trainspotting, the lovable rogues of Shallow Grave, the exoticism of The Beach and the bold visual experimentation of 28 Days Later and Sunshine. It repackages them in feelgood form for all but the most delicate of tastes.True, the sight of a young boy diving through an ocean of sewage (with filmstar photo held aloft) recalls the stronger images from Trainspotting. But here it is done for humour and too brief to be offensive. Everything about the film is refreshingly clever and a delight to watch. If occasionally there are subtitles, they are inventively inserted at interesting places on the screen with their own background colours.The plot starts just before the question that lays the golden egg and cuts engagingly back through the boy's life using flashbacks. Why is he being tortured? How did he get on the show? Why doesn't he care about the money? In the background is his love, Latika, whom he has known since childhood. Both orphaned, she saw him by chance (standing abandoned in the rain) and he lets her share a corrugated iron shelter. It's a touching scene without too much sugar. And chance is the theme of the film. How does a Slumdog like Jemal guess the answers to general knowledge questions that could baffle the educated? That's what everybody wants to know.Few Western directors have managed to embrace India so convincingly. Colours become sanitised, dirt becomes exotic. Boyle leaves us in no doubt as to the degradation, but makes it palatable through daring cinematography. This is no work of realism such as that of Satyajit Ray. Apart from a joyful closing credits scene, neither is it Bollywood. And although I thoroughly enjoyed it, I can't help feeling that some critics have gone overboard in estimating it to be more than the sum of its parts. As if Mamma Mia! could become art-house if it only had had one more ancient artefact. The film has nothing very deep to say. It is entertainment, pure and simple. Boyle's hodgepodge talents have been brought together for once in a recipe that any professional chef should be very proud of. It might even be his best film since Trainspotting, but it is heralds no new frontiers. A rounded display of talent that holds its own against the best in the Hollywood tradition. I would hate to think that the future of British film-making is in India, but I'm pleased Danny Boyle has firmly found his wings again. And I was also very pleased to see one of the stars of the outstanding TV series, Skins, conquer the lead role.Slumdog Millionaire is a bag of very colourful tricks. The end result is great entertainment. It would be more remarkable if, in a later film, we were to see these stirring skills used for real comment on the human condition (for instance) and take us off the popcorn ride. When will the real Danny Boyle stand up? Near the Taj Mahal, I once looked down and saw boys pretending to levitate a corpse. They wanted tourists to throw money down to them (with a cut, no doubt, for the boy beneath the stretcher). It was all good fun. But made me wonder when the real fakir would appear.",Slumdog Millionaire
86,MaxBorg89,A true winner,10,7 February 2009,"After the rather disastrous response to The Beach (which wasn't completely unjustified), genre-hopping director Danny Boyle declared he works best at home, in the UK. How ironic, then, that his best film since Trainspotting - which was released in 1996 - is set in the low-life areas of Mumbai (better known to foreigners as Bombay), India. Then again, Slumdog Millionaire remains an eminently British production since, alongside Boyle, producer Christian Colson (The Descent), writer Simon Beaufoy (The Full Monty) and star Dev Patel (Skins) were all born and raised in good old England.The director's versatility pushes itself to the limit, considering the story revolves around the famous TV quiz Who Wants To Be A Millionaire. As the opening title card informs us, a certain Jamal Malik (Patel), is one question short of winning the top prize. How did he do it? The show's sleazy host (Anil Kapoor) is convinced the boy cheated and calls the police, who arrest Jamal as soon as he leaves the studio (the final question will be answered the next day). He is questioned/tortured all night, simply because no one believes an uneducated ""slumdog"" can be that smart or lucky (and let's not forget the host tried to set him up at one point). Jamal chooses to tell his story, revealing that the clues to the answers are all hidden in the key events of his brief, tragic life.At this point, the film follows a flashback-based structure: as every question of the quiz is displayed on the screen, Jamal recalls a specific incident that contributed to his current status. We are thus enabled to see the various tricks he and his older brother Salim used to earn money when they were kids, the religious persecution that led to the death of their mother, the multiple challenges in the form of local criminal gangs and, most of all, his pure, honest love for a girl named Latika (played by Freida Pinto in the present day sections). All these elements are connected. Or, as Jamal says: ""Maybe it is written."".Shot with gritty realism on the real streets of Mumbai, the film reeks of hand-held energy and comes off as Boyle's most dynamic and vital movie in a long time. There's a certain similarity between Jamal getting by on the sidewalks and Mark Renton escaping from the police at the beginning of Trainspotting, and Boyle bravely acknowledges the connection by openly inserting a homage to his cult masterpiece's legendary toilet dive scene (the Slumdog Millionaire version takes the concept quite literally). He never looks away when things get ugly, but fundamentally this remains his most uplifting picture to date, so beautiful and touching it almost feels strange to know he nearly turned down the project, based solely on his lack of enthusiasm - to put it mildly - for the quiz aspect of the premise.The truth is, of course, a whole other thing: the game element is merely a MacGuffin, an abstract factor that serves only one purpose, namely starting the story and thus leaving room for the extraordinary circumstances under which Jamal, Salim, Latika and dozens of other children had to (and still have to) survive. In the end, no one really cares whether Jamal will win the top prize or not (although Boyle deserves credit for making the quiz sequences even more suspenseful than they are in real life); what matters is his story, the human story, the one everyone can relate to on some level.Ultimately, the victory that counts is off-screen: it's the artistic triumph of one man, who against all odds (given his rather dark back catalogue) delivered the feel-good movie of the decade. Calling him a millionaire is a tad inappropriate (the film was made on a shoestring budget), but thanks to this amazing story, Danny Boyle is a real winner.",Slumdog Millionaire

88,juneebuggy,"Beautiful, gritty, hopeful and exhausting",9,29 September 2014,"Visually stunning, moving, gritty, violent and hopeful. Not sure if it was worthy of all the awards it received but a movie I'm very glad I saw. I liked the way Jamal's (Dev Patel) story was told, clever storytelling there, following a Mumbai teen who grew up in the slums and became a contestant on the Indian version of ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"" He is arrested under suspicion of cheating, and while being interrogated, events from his life history are shown which explain why he knows the answers.If I'm honest I didn't really ""enjoy"" watching this, I found it exhausting even though it's a very good movie. It just gives such an unflinching look at poverty and exploited children that even with the beautiful love story and closing dance sequence I still came away depressed. I usually love these types of movies too but Slumdog hit me on a base level that really affected me. For that reason alone I have to give it a high rating 7/19/14",Slumdog Millionaire
89,rooprect,Gumdog Godzillianaire,3,8 December 2010,"I'm usually pretty good at coming up with witty, poignant titles for my reviews, but this movie doesn't even deserve that.Every few years someone from a rich Western culture makes a film about a poor Eastern culture which makes rich Western audiences feel better about themselves because now they somehow connect with poor Easterners. Slumdog Millionaire is one such film.It's horribly contrived, like an ABC afterschool special. Themes which could otherwise be handled with interesting complexity are bashed over your head with all the subtlety of the Bhopal disaster. The good guy is lily-white good, and the bad guys are evil satans. Even when the good guy must do something unpleasant (such as fighting to protect a loved one), he cowers and lets his evil friend do the dirtywork. This film is nothing but a polarization of good vs. evil which reduces it (and Indian culture) to a silly comic book. But they cloak it in lots of tear-jerking footage of poverty, beggars and injustice so it makes you feel like you're watching something of social significance.I lived in India for several years. I've seen the slums, the poverty, the despair & the hope of the people. It's much more complicated than what this silly travel brochure offers. I keep hoping one day someone will get it right, but alas, not this time. I'm sure someone will try again in 5 years or so.",Slumdog Millionaire

91,3xHCCH,"Shades of ""City of God"", But Still Very Good",9,26 January 2009,"Jamal Malik is poor young man from the slums of Mumbai joins the TV game show ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"" From that simple yet ingenious plot and setting, this most memorable film unfolds, detailing the events in this boy's miserable life which (very) coincidentally enables him to answer the trivia questions in the quiz show.I like that the movie delved on the relationship of two brothers, Jamal and his elder brother Salim. While Salim goes the gangster/hit-man route, Jamal strove to make a more decent life for himself as a call center gofer. While there is violence in their relationship, brotherly love still comes through in repeated occasions.In addition, there is also a love story here. A slum girl named Latika had her life intertwined with the brothers during an ethnic massacre when they were kids. Jamal and Latika naturally become fond of other, but are separated two traumatic times, but can they find each other again at the end? The story was told as flashbacks from their childhood, teenage years and their young adulthood. The child actors were most affecting in their portrayal, especially the boys. The child Jamal had that wide-eyed innocence, while the child Salim had that worldly-wise jadedness. Very effective! I do not know why the adult Jamal (Dev Patel) was acting in such a flat manner in several parts, but he is most effective in his scenes with Latika (Frieda Pinto).Honestly, I really felt that 'Slumdog"" had a big similarity with the Brazilian classic ""City of God"" when it came to the brutal and unforgiving depiction of the squalor and violence in the slums. The unmitigated violence in the treatment of the poor slum kids is most disturbing. The big difference of course is that ""Slumdog"" is more neatly tied up and positive in its final message when compared to ""City"".This movie already won the Best Picture Drama in the Golden Globes. Yesterday, it won the Best Picture in the Producers Guild of America. And just this morning, it won Best Cast in the Screen Actors Guild Awards. It certainly bodes very well that this movie is the film to beat come Oscar time for Best Picture.The treatment of Director Danny Boyle (of ""Trainspotting"") is very exciting and dramatic. Though story elements can be quite contrived (like that final 20M rupee question could not have been that easy, could it?), it will still hold you at the edge of your seats until the last scene.",Slumdog Millionaire
92,EUyeshima,Emotional Connectivity Blends with Visual Panache in Boyle's Hindi Fanciful Tale of Destiny,9,4 January 2009,"It's difficult to categorize a film that takes as many precariously driven dramatic turns as this 2008 picture directed by the versatile Danny Boyle. So why even bother since he manages to navigate fluidly between the feel-bad and feel-good extremes of Simon Beaufoy's (""Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day"") emotionally dense script with aplomb? The apt title refers to someone who grew up in the slums of Mumbai, and in this case, is on the verge of becoming very wealthy due to a serendipitous situation that leads him to be a finalist on the Hindi version of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"" On the surface, the premise sounds rather silly, but the familiar game show, already a trivia footnote in this country, provides the catalyst for the vividly rendered events that unfold for one particular boy named Jamal Malik, a coffee carrier at a local telemarketing company. Contrivances aside, it is his life experiences that feed him the answers to the increasingly difficult questions, but the producers suspect a scam at work and have the police torture him in order to confess. What really emerges is Malik's undying devotion to his one true love, Latika, from whom he has long been estranged due to the desperate circumstances in her life.The movie's childhood flashbacks have a Dickensian quality set against a cultural tableau unfamiliar to most of us. They focus on young Jamal and his older brother Salim, who are soon orphaned after their mother is killed for being a Muslim. They are joined by another abandoned orphan Latika, and together they dub themselves the Three Musketeers. They eventually find themselves indentured under the servitude of the deceptively kind Maman, who goes to extremes in keeping the children as street beggars. The brothers escape and eventually figure out how to scam tourists at the Taj Mahal, while Latika suffers the consequences of being left with Maman. The rest of the plot shows how the brothers diverge in values and how Latika becomes an unwilling mistress for a rival gang leader. Amazingly, Beaufoy's screenplay juxtaposes these spiraling events with the multiple-choice questions posed by Prem, the jocular ""Millionaire"" host, a popular figure who reveals his own sleazy underside in short order. There is such a swirl of activity with every episode in the film that there is little time to question the plausibility of the many plot turns because the resulting implausibility is what makes the movie so arresting.Boyle gives co-directing credit to Loveleen Tandan, previously a casting director specializing in India-themed films like Mira Nair's ""Monsoon Wedding"" and ""Vanity Fair"", and it's obvious that the combination of their talents gives us a greater intimacy into India than one would expect from Boyle by himself. Other than his charming fable, ""Millions"", there is little indication in Boyle's resume (the sci-fi shocker ""Sunshine"", the post-apocalyptic thriller ""28 Days Later"", the drug-infested ""Trainspotting"") that he would have been capable of telling such a fanciful tale so convincingly. At the same time, the visual flourishes (thanks primarily to the stunning cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantel) and fast-cut editing reflect his familiar touches. The no-frills performances befit the story with Dev Patel bringing emotional focus to the grown Jamal and Frieda Pinto appropriately fetching as the grown Latika. Smaller roles are filled with a few more familiar faces with Indian movie icon Anil Koopar playing Prem and character actor Irrfan Khan (the father in ""The Namesake"") as the determined police inspector. There are times when the film feels overly manipulative, but the buoyant spirit keeps thing afloat just when you feel you've been left on sensory overload.",Slumdog Millionaire
93,jaybob,Another film that did not deserve the best film Oscar.,9,31 March 2009,"Let me start off here, with a reason for my rating of 9. It is based on the excellent production values and some very good acting. The direction by Danny Boyle is excellent.The script however is lacking in believability.As we all know our young hero is a contestant on a TV program, Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, I for one hated the Version of this show when it was on the air in the US. The parts we see see in the movie are as annoying as it was on TV. (spoiler alert)_I tend to agree with the reasons why the police arrest our lad.There are some very grim scenes in the first part of movie but then like all fantasies we have the happy ending.The last 20 minutes were exceedingly long & very repetitious. I was getting bored, I knew what was going to happen they took forever getting there.Over the 80 some odd years of the Oscar, there have been quite a few that did not deserve the best film award.Add Slumdog Millionaire to the list. Here are just a few of the others, that do not belong.Crash-----Gentlemens Agreement-----The Sting-- The Apartment. all are very good movies BUT none deserved best film Oscar.Ratings:***1/2 (out of 4) 93 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10)",Slumdog Millionaire
94,aharmas,One of the best cinema offered in 2008,10,9 November 2008,"Danny Boyle has come up with some interesting cinema, certainly defining himself as someone above average. What he achieves in ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is transcend the line between inspiration and a miracle, awakening an emotional connection to the very special element great cinema can deliver. The packages might have changed, and the contents are more controversial and maybe a bit more tied to reality, certainly taking us to an exotic local, teaching us that our world extends beyond our freeway and limited perception of how more than the other half of the world's population has to deal without certainly preaching to us.The tale of two brothers' lives is told to us through episodic flashbacks tied to an episode of India's ""Who Wants to be a millionaire?"". At first, the story introduces one of the brothers as being the subject of a very strong interrogation to find out whether he is being truthful about some knowledge that might be relevant to the game. As he answers the questions, we discover that this young man's life story might be more interesting than we originally expected.There is an element of freshness in the way the story is presented, as we accompany Jamal through his life odyssey from a young child in the slums to a man who is determined to save those he loves. There are some strong emotions in the film, and Boyle's direction keeps the film dynamic and engaging.Prepare yourself to be overtaken by emotions as varied as joy, pity, happiness, anger, revulsion, surprise, and an exhilarating conclusion rarely seen in movies anymore. This film has made me grateful to be alive and that we still have people in cinema like Boyle who understands the power and beauty of the medium. He knows that the perfect mix of a great story and the respective imagery can provoke unforgettable memories in its audience.",Slumdog Millionaire
95,questl-18592,Slumdog Not a Millionaire,7,1 October 2020,"This was an interesting movie, but I think the method it uses to tell the story hurts it more than helps.Slumdog follows Patel's character as he strives to win the Who Wants to be a Millionaire game show in India and the many, many flashbacks that get him there. That's really my main problem with it too. It feels like the structure is off, there's so much jumping around to the past and present, constantly breaking up the flow of the story as Patel stairs into the distance and waits for the next flashback to commence. That's really my only legit problem with the movie, but it's substantial.On the upside, the acting is strong, the story is interesting and it really shows a side of Indian culture we don't often see. In an effort to show how game changing winning this prize is, we get to spend a lot of time looking at the horrible lives people are living in this city/country. So, the moral of the story is that you should live a nightmarish life so you might be able to win a game show later!Solid acting and story elevate this but the choppy style keep it grounded. It might not be a masterpiece but this is still a solid film and worth checking out.",Slumdog Millionaire
96,valleyjohn,Good but not Danny Boyle's best,8,25 January 2009,"If the title ""Slumdog Millionaire"" was mentioned six months ago when discussing Oscar Nomination most people would not have heard of it. Yet Danny Boyle seems to have come from nowhere and won the hearts and minds of many movie goers with this visually stunning movie but do i think it is worthy of it's ten nominations or of winning the best picture Oscar?........... Today is the biggest day in Jamal Malik's life.A penniless, eighteen year-old orphan from the slums of Mumbai, he's one question away from winning a staggering 20 million rupees on India's ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"" But when the show breaks for the night, suddenly, he is arrested on suspicion of cheating. After all, how could an uneducated street kid possibly know so much? Determined to get to the bottom of Jamal's story, the jaded Police Inspector spends the night probing Jamal's incredible past, from his riveting tales of the slums where he and his brother Salim survived by their wits to his hair-raising encounters with local gangs to his heartbreak over Latika, the unforgettable girl he loved and lost.Each chapter of Jamal's increasingly layered story reveals where he learned the answers to the shows seemingly impossible quizzes. But one question remains a mystery: what is this young man with no apparent desire for riches really doing on the game show?When the new day dawns and Jamal returns to answer the final question, the Inspector and sixty million viewers are about to find out...I am a bid fan of Danny Boyle . He is an unassuming , humble man that makes great movies with the minimal of fuss and sometimes with very little publicity.Slumdog Millionaire didn't need much publicity because critics loved it and word of mouth has made this film the success it has become.I have to admit , although i really enjoyed this movie i was ever so slightly disappointed with it too.I felt an hour in that it was dragging slightly and that the film lost it's focus and direction a little. I also felt the ""Who wants to be a millionaire "" presenter ,played by Anil Kapoor was way over the top. A little too bollywoodish ( i just made that word up!) for me. Thankfully it came together in the the last half hour and i must admit i had a tear in my eye at the end. There are some great scenes in the film. One where Jamal goes to extremes to get the autograph of his favourite movie star by jumping through the hole in the outside toilet into what lay beneath and then running through a crowd of people covered from head to toe in muck to confront his hero.The other , altogether far more sinister , when Salim watches as the gang blinds his friend just so he can double his begging income. That scene really made me wince.Strangely enough , despite ten Oscar nominations none are for the acting and i think that is because they characters are played by several different people because of the ageing process.Dev Patel does deserve a mention for his performance as does the beautiful Freida Pinto and i really enjoyed the scenes at the railway station in the final credits but they were not quite at the standard to get a best actor or actress Oscar nomination . So we go back to the question "" Is this worthy of winning the best picture Oscar"" ?. In my eyes no. But because of past greats such as ""Trainspotting"" , ""Shallow Grave"" and ""Twenty Eight Weeks Later"" , Danny Boyle might just be due one .8 out of 10",Slumdog Millionaire
97,truemythmedia,A Beautiful Film,8,23 May 2019,"There are times when we look back on the Oscars and wonder how certain films won over others. Not in the 2009 Oscars; it's still clear today that ""Slumdog"" deserved its win.Things that make this film stand out in particular are its unconventional method of storytelling, the spellbindingly saturated cinematography, the breakneck editing and general pacing, and most of all, its overall message, which feels incredibly hopeful for a movie filled with so much darkness.
It had been a while since I'd seen this movie, so when it was requested as a review I was more than happy to sit down and watch it again. Honestly, I enjoyed it more than I remembered. I had forgotten about some of the moments of darkness, and some other moments of humor. Watching it again was a treat. Though there are some melodramatic moments, it more than makes up for it with the beautiful cinematography and message. This story is one that makes the audience cheer for the characters to be together, and then it rewards them greatly.",Slumdog Millionaire

99,Galina_movie_fan,Three Musketeers from the slums of Mumbai,9,10 January 2009,"Slumdog Millionaire (2008) is a very good movie with the astounding cinematography, virtuoso directing, and the heartbreaking yet optimistic story. The acting by three main characters especially by a newcomer, Dev Patel, is compelling. Patel plays a street kid Jamal Malik (Patel), an 18 year-old orphan from the slums of Mumbai, who made it to the Indian version of the TV show Who wants to be a millionaire?"" and keeps answering correctly every question. The secret is that every question represents a chapter of his own life, his growing up and surviving on the streets, his adventures and experiences often dramatic and even tragic. When he is just one question away from winning 20 million rupees (around $450,000), the time is up, and millions of TV-viewers who root for Jamal would have to wait for the following night to see him go for the big prize. Jamal is arrested by the police right after the game and he will spend the next day been rather brutally interrogated by police officers who want to find out how the street boy with no education can answer the difficult questions correctly. Fifteen years from the lives of Jamal, his older brother Salem and another orphan from the slums of Mumbai, ""the third musketeer"", the girl named Latika (Frieda Pinto), Jamal's true love since their childhood will reveal in flashbacks, and by the end of Jamal's story, it won't surprise us why he knows all answers. IMO, the only weak point in the story was the big 20 million rupees question. I won't reveal it but trust me, the whole reading or movie watching world knows the answer, and the question was too easy for such high stake BUT it fits the story very well, so I tend to be lenient.The best part of the movie is IMO the look at India from within, the glorious views of India's beauty and horrifying captures of its unspeakable poverty, from the slums of Mumbai and the dizzyingly crowded streets of Bombay to the heavenly magnificent Taj Mahal.Boyle's directing very much reminds Fernando Meirelles inspiring movie-making in Cidade de Deus aka City of God by its dynamism, fast and furious camera movements, and amazingly deep and compassionate understanding of the material. I won't be surprised if Doyle receives the Oscar nod for directing. He very well deserved it along with his camera-man, editor, writer, and the young actors.",Slumdog Millionaire
100,RainDogJr,Wish You Were Here,9,21 February 2009,"Sunday of Oscars means Friday of Oscar-nominated films coming finally to the theaters here in Mexico City certainly. Actually this last week has the first day of the FICCO (Festival International de Cine Contemporaneo de la Ciudad de Mexico), certainly a chance to see very interesting films (The Wrestler, Maradona by Kusturica (which I'm going to see this same night, for free, at the Zocalo for the first time on the big screen since I already saw it a couple of times on DVD), Waltz with Bashir, Bob Marley: Exodus 77, The Good, the Bad, the Weird are some of those that I don't want to miss), certainly I'm glad it began and it began precisely with a film that the Academy nominated for Best Picture, it began with Milk. And I missed the chance to see Milk on the big screen before the ""big night"" (it will be released during the first days of March). Yesterday I had planned to see my first film of the FICCO yet Slumdog Millionaire came finally yesterday to Mexico City so is very very probable that tomorrow I will be watching the Oscars after seeing only two of the five pictures that are ""fighting"" for the big prize of the night (Benjamin Button being the other) yet after seeing what for most is going to be the winner of the night, certainly this one that was my fifth encounter with a Danny Boyle film and if not a perfect one sure it is a great film. Is a surprise to see a normal boy enduring a torture by some police men, certainly they want that the boy, who is our main character and who is played by Dev Patel, Tanay Chheda and Ayush Mahesh Khedekar, Jamal Malik talk but they will end saying something like ""he's a tough guy"". So we go back to see that certainly Jamal during his childhood had no other chance but to fight for his life. This is absolutely my favourite part, when Ayush Mahesh Khedekar and Tanay Chheda are Jamal, the City of God. Realistic, we have who is apparently nothing but a hero, he sees street children and he comes with a tasty Coca-Cola for the heat, for them he must be good since he allow them to eat a little more, these are just children, many but certainly we known Jamal, Jamal's elder brother Salim (played by Madhur Mitta, Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala and Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail) and Latika (played by Freida Pinto, Tanvi Ganesh Lonkar and Rubina Ali). Very early in the picture we see that of the two brothers one is more of a Zé Pequeno and the other is more of a Buscapé, and we see moments of happiness yet very tragic moments that become more tragic for the boys because they can't do anything, they are just there trying to get by day by day so when that mentioned hero comes their life has a little light, they don't have to worry for food, they have their minds in other stuff that is different from the stuff that is in the mind of the hero. So we now very well since the beginning both Jamal and Salim, we know that if it depend only on him Salim would have never return to Mumbai, after all they found something completely different, something more like the heaven of their heads, I guess seeing the Taj Mahal is more than impressive. But also we know that Jamal's heart is only for one girl, this is a love story, a magical one, why Jamal was that tough? We have realistic answers, a realistic background, powerful part. Why Jamal knew all the answers when he was on the Indian TV show ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" if he never had a formal education, if he was just a slumdog? He certainly not cheated, for the police men was not too complicated to find that after Jamal talked about those moments of his past that came to his mind that night when he was on the TV show. Here the point, the most ""love moment"": when Jamal, during the second night on ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"", is only one question away of the 20 million rupees he uses one of those lifelines, he doesn't know the answer, we know that when he says that on TV he is not lying, he marks the only telephone number he knows, his brother's, yet we know where is that cell phone, time to a dramatic little moment before he hear her voice, now the answer is not important, even if so she can't give it but he after all came to that show not for the money. So let's dance, why? it is writtenin the script.",Slumdog Millionaire
101,Kingslaay,"Terrible film, disgrace to Hollywood and film",1,5 February 2017,"How can this film be described? A number of things pop up quickly such as Inaccurate and Exaggerated. The plot just like the portrayal of India is completely unrealistic While film has the ability to be imaginative and creative it should never cross the line where it insults the viewers intelligence. And boy does it insinuate a lot. We have to believe that some person from a poor background has a memory that just so happens to answer every question in Millionaire. First the movie puts down a great country and people who do not have very good lives and then it is plausible for this person to know all the answers because he has 'experienced' life. Unless he is similar to Michael Ross from Suits and has a photographic memory this is ludicrous.This movie portrays a flawed but beautiful country in a very poor and negative light. It focuses on the negative aspects of India such as its poverty and sadly that is all we see. However in reality Mumbai has a number of beautiful parts and in certain areas it is quite heavenly. A number of key settings and themes is completely exaggerated. Bribery does exist in government but this is mostly at an administrative level, where a 'gift' can expedite something. Slums are a problem and exist on the outskirts of the city - very important to note. Over time they developed as a result of people with no education, prospects or savings who started living on the outer side of the big city because they found it hard to earn a living. Sadly India does not have welfare or assistance in the commercial and capitalist capital of the country. They lived illegally and still do on city grounds and rake in income by an means possible, sadly this involves having many children to beg for money. As you can imagine this behavior has compounded and out of control but - not a central part of the city. Slums and slum live is not Mumbai or India and is a lie in film to show a country exists in this state. What is disheartening is Dev Patel and Frieda Pinto and the Indian production staff who exploited their own country and they know is a lot better for some Hollywood stardom. When you have cowardice and people with no backbone within the country what do you expect? They were too happy to serve India's head on a platter to a Western audience that is constantly happy to see poverty and sadness in other countries to feel better about themselves. An audience that would like to see differences of a third world so they can ignore the shortcomings in their own backyard which is why this film was well received, lets not deny it.This movie showed waste in India but the real waste is the film itself. It is a disgrace to a great nation, a lie broadcast to Hollywood and an over exaggerated movie. I think I can pin point when the Academy awards lost its credibility.",Slumdog Millionaire
102,bobbysing,An Intelligently directed & well scripted movie but portrays India in a bad taste. (Part One),6,21 February 2009,"It's the most appreciated movie in the last few months (2008), winning several awards at various film festivals all over the globe. So I was excited enough to the see it, expecting another movie which will be added in my ""Movies to See Before You Die"" list. No doubt it is one of the best movies of recent times but sadly I didn't find it worth adding my ""Must See Movies"" List and I will surely give you my reasons for that here in the end.Firstly talking about the movie, an interesting observation is that if the viewer is not told about who directed this flick, then, he is bound to take it as a movie made by an Indian or a person with an Indian origin. But surprisingly it is directed by ""Danny Boyle"" of 'Trainspotting' and '28 Days Later' fame. Though he has done a brilliant job but in my opinion he selected this subject and directed this movie keeping in mind the festival circuit and attention he would get because of the Indian touch and feel of the movie. You might get my point more clearly after watching it and reading my points at the end of this review.The story of this movie is about a young teenage boy winning millions at a TV Show (KBC of Indian Television) and how each question asked by the anchor has a relation to his past life. He knows most of the answers as all the questions have something similar to the circumstances of his real life. So the anchor at one point of time doubts that he may be cheating in the show. In order to investigate his loyalty, he is handed over to the police for one night, but nothing is found against him and he is allowed to play the game, the next final day.Each question put to him in the game show has a sequence attached to it in the screenplay which is well written and enjoyable. The growth of the children from a small age to their teenage youth is well executed. But the thrill which should have been there regarding the game is missing. May be it's because from the title itself you already know that the contestant is going to win. Moreover, the narration of the movie is more towards an artistic offbeat film (like that of ""Salaam Bombay""), which reduces its chances of becoming a big hit in the Indian circuit (But may do well in multiplexes).Performances wise everybody does a fine job especially Dev Patel and all the child artists featuring in the movie. Their expressions and dialogue delivery has been directed perfectly and they never seem to be acting. Anil Kapoor, Irfan Khan, Saurabh Shukla & Mahesh Manjrekar are just fine doing their parts with nothing extra-ordinary to talk about. But they are lucky enough to get this project which has become world famous by now. One thing i couldn't understand was that why Anil Kapoor did not want the slum boy to win in his show and why he tried to give him the wrong answer. Camerwork showing the slums and riots is brilliant. In fact the opening scene is the most well shot sequence with all the kids running followed by the policemen.Musically, there are no full length songs in the movie and the soundtrack alone is more enjoyable separately. The best song is ""Jai Ho"" which was shockingly refused by Subhash Ghai for his movie ""Yuvraaj"". The background music is superb giving an ample support to the direction. A. R. Rahman gives another good score in this International project and has already won praises and awards, making his presence felt in the International Film & Music Circles. We are really proud to have him as a National Treasure.Now coming to the points why this movie could not impress me as expected and why it is not being added to my ""Movies to See Before You Die"" List.",Slumdog Millionaire
103,Matt_Layden,Silly Mistakes Took Me Out Of The Experience,8,1 February 2009,"Slumdog Millionaire is a love story, about the troubles one young man goes through in order to be with the woman he loves. Jamal is a contestant on the game show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, and is interrogated after answering all the correct answers, he explains how he knew those answers and we are taken on a ride through his life and through India.This film is marvelous to watch, from the opening shots of India and the hyper kinetic chase through the slums, I was immediately captured by the beauty this film offers its viewer. Both beautiful and depressing, violent and peaceful, dangerous and safe. Slumdog rises to be one of the better films of 2008 and was so close to being a top contender, but faults with the film are technical and it immediately took me out of that zone of beauty and made me realize I was watching a movie.I'll get to that later, but first, let me tell you how good the film is. It's really good. The vibrant colours hit you and never leave, you actually feel like you are in another world. The sound design is immense and astounding, great attention to detail that is backed with a joyful soundtrack.The cast is wonderful, Freida Pinto is beautiful beyond words, playing the love interests of the main character in the present time. Each character (Jamal, his brother Salim and Litika) are portrayed at different stages in their lives, by different actors. I enjoyed the really young child actors the most, their innocence and voice worked so well. Dev Petal plays Jamal on the show and despite being new to the acting craft, feels comfortable in the role. One would not know that the kid is actually British.The film is an all around feel good flick, you will cheer for the kids and their adventures. I will admit, when I first heard about it and saw a trailer I was not really interested, the India background turned me off. I didn't think it was going to be an endearing and thought provoking film. First mistake ladies and gentlemen is going into a flick with preconceived notions. Of course after hearing all the praise I decided to give it a go. I'm glad I did.Now on to my own little personal rant as I said earlier. I was taken out of the movie experiences a couple times and it ultimately ruined bits for me. One would be after the show is turned on the television and Jamal is being questioned we see a boom mic over his head. Bobbing away up in the air, the second is when we see Latika for the first time after she was captured. The continuity with her piercings in her nose were totally off. Normally the continuity thing wouldn't bother me if it weren't so apparent, but the boom mic really did take me out of it. Or what about the fact that these kids speak English when they are older. Where the hell did they learn that?That said, the film does have some minor flaws, it's not perfect in anyway. I wanted a bit more from Latika, she was under used. The millionaire questions were incredibly easy, I could be a millionaire right now. you'll enjoy the flashbacks more then the present, but I'm assuming you're suppose to. All in all, Slumdog is a good film.",Slumdog Millionaire
104,pc95,Great 1st two-thirds/ Standard last third,7,17 August 2009,"This Oscar winner may not be deserved as a Best Picture of the Year especially compared to the Reader, but it marks a big improvement over the past several Best Pictures especially including Crash and No Country for Old Men - 2 awful movies which prove the utter distaste and clownship that the academy has eroded into recently. At least Slumdog Millionaire is a good movie. It's first half is quite enthralling in setting, pacing, story, and detail. The child-actors completely shine for this movie. Especially captivating were the brothers together dynamically and their adventures (spoiler) into the darker reaches of society with child peddlers and literal garbage heaps. However the story and really the actors by young adulthood seem sort of standard and hackneyed. They're not terrible, in fact satisfactory, but they didn't hold my interest level the way the children and story did earlier. Part of it may have been the sheer grotesqueness of the slums portrayed early on. Slumdog Millionaire's storyline is overall well developed and paced, with a simple and effective narrative. It was one of the better movies of 2008 - for me maybe not an Academy Award winner (I thought The Reader should've taken honors), but a movie with quite a few high points and definitely recommended.",Slumdog Millionaire
105,moviewizguy,Is that your final answer?,9,2 January 2009,"There's no need to phone a friend, ask the audience, nor choose a fifty-fifty to determine if you should see this film. The answer is obvious: SEE IT NOW. The film follows the story of the life of an impoverished Indian teen Jamal Malik, who becomes a contestant on the Hindi version of ""Who Wants to be A Millionaire?"", wins, and is then suspected of cheating.Throughout the film, we learn that Jamal is able to answer the questions in the game show correctly because of key points in his life. Not only is this about a game show, it's about Jamal's life story. The film mixes the flashbacks and present flawlessly. Probably telling a life story of someone is not new. Just last December, there was ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button."" However, the fact that the film mixes Jamal's life story with his ability to answer the questions in the game show is quite clever and ingenious. It adds another fresh twist to what might be another story about someone's life.Even too, the game show plays a crucial element to the plot so the whole puzzle fits together perfectly in the end. It's just another thing that makes this movie so great. Now let's talk about the performances. Wow! Weren't they great? Dev Patel gives us a breakthrough performance. Everyone else, although not as memorable as Patel, gave us their all in here too. The soundtrack is also very good. I loved it.So what makes this movie so great? Just watch it. I really can't spoil it. Maybe I can just say it's about fate and destiny but then you might roll your eyes. It's just a captivating film with fantastic performances from unknown actors and in the end, I'll admit it, I really can't find anything to not like about the film. It's what I call a nearly flawless film. Compared to Danny Boyle's previous disappointing film, ""Sunshine,"" ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is several steps up to the right direction, not to mention one of the best films of this year.",Slumdog Millionaire
106,bob-rutzel-1,It was okay,6,7 May 2009,"Malik (Patel) goes on a TV game show Who Wants to be a Millionaire in the hope that his long lost love Latika (Pinto) sees him and still cares. The setting is India.If the powers that be wanted a FEEL GOOD movie to win Best Picture they got their wish. It was okay. I wouldn't have nominated it for Best Picture (it won for that), and I certainly wouldn't have nominated the Director for the Best Director Award (it won for that too). (Don't hold back Bob, tell us how you really feel)The beginning of this movie was confusing. I had no idea what was going on, the scenes shifted so fast and the sub-titles came and went with the wind. The sub-titles were too small, often yellow on a gold background and they didn't stay on the screen too long even if they weren't yellow on gold. I never did take that speed reading course. Oh, and get this: the sub-titles were not always in the same place, like on the bottom of the picture where sub-titles usually are. No, you had to look for them depending on who was speaking. Creative, but annoying. Also, the Nervous Camera was much in evidence quite a bit in the beginning. And, a lot of the scenes were dark like it was always night time. I almost shut it down.But, I figured out the key and just let everything go and then half of the movie came around and things began to make sense and, thank God, things slowed down so we could all understand what was going on. Sort of. And, the sub-titles went way, good riddance. And, you will (like me) figure out all the answers to the questions put to Malik on the show. Very clever, I must say. Really clever. Reminded me of The Usual Suspects (great movie, btw).But, here is the KEY for those of you who really try to follow everything in the beginning: THIS IS A LOVE STORY. As long as you know that and you remember the names Malik and Latika, that is all you really need to know. Don't bother to memorize anything else. You'll hurt yourself like I did. The music from time to time was very good (won for Best Original Score and for Best Original Song).Why everyone went ga ga over this is beyond me. It's okay. The acting all around is excellent, but ga ga? No way. I guess the other nominated movies weren't of the Feel Good ilk. And, we want to feel good, don't we? Huh?Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: I really didn't hear anything, but they talked so fast",Slumdog Millionaire

The first hour is a hectic pseudo documentary about the quite brutal childhood of two brothers in the slums of Bombay. It's funny and barbaric and very well cut.The other half is a quite conventional melodramatic love story and both the tempo and your interest gets lower and lower. 9 points for hour 1 and 4 points for hour 2.

Those episodes show enough of the misery, violence and corruption that reign in some Indian social extracts, corruption that affects also the authorities and not only them. The images are strong and suggestive. The sound track in musical terms is of great quality.

Now some 230 reviews later I am back to where I started with Danny Boyle again...That film was Millions about a boy in Scotland I thought it was brilliant: an honest, moving, fantasy, all centered on hope in desperate situations.And that pretty much is Slumdog Millionaire: a film about hope and a film about romance, eternal love, with a neat plot device of using Celador's Who Wants To Be A Millionaire to frame each extraordinary chapter. Borrowing from sources as wide apart as 30s Westerns and the classical Arabic tales, as well as the questions themselves this opens up a vista of wonderful possibilities.The other star of Slumdog is Mumbai - and this is the breakout film for India - unlike Gandhi which was very Attenborough - this really looks like an Indian production team has worked at this - amazing colours, sounds, and settings - just a shame smellovision isn't ready yet! It is a tale of pessimism and optimism, it is fun, intriguing, and charming - and if course, exciting.It is deeply romantic, but as with all of Danny Boyle's films, it is not cloying or sentimental: honesty in film is the keystone here.It's above all entertainment, and entertainment with a conscience.A clear winner for the Awards and all we can say is please Mr Boyle can we have some more?",Slumdog Millionaire
111,DeeNine-2,Top ten reasons Slumdog Millionaire is a mediocre movie:,6,9 April 2009,"(With redeeming qualities in cinematography, acting, music and sharp editing.) (And please spare me the hate mail.)10. 20,000,000 rupees is ""only"" about $411,000. 9. No toilet paper in the outhouses. 8. All the kids are healthy looking with nice teeth. 7. Latika experiences no sexual abuse! 6. No (gaunt) slum dogs are seen.5. ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"" is not a live show in India. 4. After step five the contestant does not lose ""everything"" with a wrong answer. 3. The questions were in chronological order of his life!2. Police in India TORTURE people if they think they're cheating TV shows? 1. Giving a $100 bill to Arvind would be giving it to the hated men who blinded him.Additionally I wonder: Did the copyright owners of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"" okay this? I mean, would Regis Philbin or Meredith Vieira try to cheat a contestant? Would the producers want a ratings sensation to lose?Is it okay to celebrate a movie that entertains the privileged with a rose-colored view of poverty and overpopulation?Good, however, is a City of God/Bollywood/fairytale film made for the poor of India. Only problem is this film just exploits them by water coloring over the squalor of their wretched lives. And, incidentally, by the way things are going, there is an enormous mountain of poverty to come worldwide, degrading much of humanity.(But, hey, I just got the DVD to be entertained. I don't need to hear about the troubles of the world.)(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

112,sme_no_densetsu,Top Dog,8,15 August 2009,"""Slumdog Millionaire"" tells the story of Jamal Malik (Dev Patel), a teenaged orphan from the slums of Mumbai who is in the middle of an improbable run on the Indian version of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"". However, all is not well, since the film opens with him being interrogated by police in response to accusations of cheating. Thus, Jamal relates the story of his life.I have to admit that I was skeptical of this film and half-expected a hokey feel-good story with little depth. However, while 'rags to riches' stories are indeed a dime a dozen this one is different. For one thing, the setting is one that hasn't been done to death in American film. Also, the film's romantic subplot adds an extra dimension to the proceedings.The cast is a good one, even though it includes no familiar faces. While none of the film's ten Oscar nominations came in the acting categories, the acting is consistently above average.Danny Boyle's direction is top-notch and resulted in a well-deserved Best Director Oscar. This, along with the Oscar-winning editing and cinematography combine to produce a vibrant, dazzling film. Also worthy of note is the score, which netted the film two more Oscars (Best Original Score & Best Original Song). The music is quite unique throughout and is as energetic as the visuals.I'm glad to see Danny Boyle return to form with another film as solid as ""Trainspotting"". This one is top-notch entertainment; slightly lightweight perhaps, but eminently satisfying nonetheless. In my opinion, a worthy Best Picture Oscar winner.",Slumdog Millionaire
113,michaeltrivedi,Pretty Good,7,29 December 2019,"This was a rough and tough movie. It was good. It was funny, adventurous. It was a rags to riches story. It was a very fun watch. Entertaining all the way through, except it lost steam near the end.Watch it7 stars",Slumdog Millionaire
114,KUAlum26,"Interesting and compelling,but I don't fully buy it",7,10 February 2009,"Jamir(Dev Patel,who should be bracing himself for plenty of work offers here in the states and shortly)has had anything but an easy young life. At eighteen,he's witnessed his mother get killed,his brothers get separated from him and lost contact with a girl who'd become the love of his life AT LEAST twice. He's been beaten,kidnapped,robbed and humiliated in various ways and has had to scrape and scratch for every rupee,pound and rupee as he's made his way to a safe,if perhaps lowly and disrespected ,job at a call center not far from his hometown province in Mumbai.So when he's able to somehow correctly ""guess"" his way through the Indian version of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"" on his way to a fortune(20 million rupees,which I'm guessing would equal about $5 Million American),there is more than a little suspicion and skepticism as to this ""Slumdog""'s conquest of the show.Firstly,I have to say I'm probably far more aligned with those who've reviewed this that were NOT in love with this film,and I'll dispense with my reasons first and thusly: this film's central struggle--the boy Jamir's calm,almost mystic and improbably march toward the grad prize on the game show--taxes my own personal suspension of disbelief to the point of snapping. EVERY single one of the questions has a cosmic ""connection"" to his life to that point,and his completely uncanny ability to divine the answers through that,while it may make for an interesting,compelling and,yes,romantic story,it leaves a less stock-committed viewer(such as myself)gawed in disbelief through much of it. Also,the pacing of this movie moves in such herky-jerky,stop-and-start patterns that unless a viewer is fully invested in it(which I gather many people have been),then one is either going to be agitated,distracted or even drowsy(as I was,I must confess,at one point)trying to keep up with the weaved or blended story lines.It's most principally in those reasons(plus the decidedly cultural disconnect of the sort of larger-then-life Bollywood style film-making,particularly toward the end,which may be more of a problem of my just not being greatly familiar with rather than any real quality inferiority of the show)that I cannot give better than a decent rating of this film.NOw,that having been said,why I cannot give this movie terrible reviews lie mostly in the fact(hinted in the summary line)that the movie,for all its quirks,inconsistencies and challenges to one's suspension of disbelief,STILL manages to possess human stories and conflicts that really are interesting and compelling. I credit the actors,most notably PAtel,Freida Pinto(as the girl of his dreams,a one-time friend),Saurabh Shukla(As the highly skeptical police Sargent,charged with trying to shake down Jamir when the show gets suspicious and calls the authorities in the middle of taping),Ayush Mohammed Ismail(As young Salim,JAmal's friend),Ayush Mahesh Khedekar(As young Jamir),Rubiana Ali(As a younger LAtika)and Anil Kapoor(as the host of the ""Millionaire""show,a both charismatic and yet potentially shady character)as being the ones who give this show the kind of sympathetic qualities that both salvage it for me and has made it such an emotional fan favorite elsewhere.Director DAnny Boyle,one NOT shy about incorporating dense,jarring,gross and all-around-disturbing images to his movies,does the same here,but is able to temper it with more tender,intimate and humane moments to give it the kind of fanciful,romantic spirit that it so desperately needs to make this film have any chance of walking and talking. While I cannot claim to be a fan of this show,I can appreciate the qualities that it brings. I just cannot say this is the best movie of 2008. Worth a look,however,absolutely.",Slumdog Millionaire
115,pyrocitor,"Cinematic life imitates art; an uplifting, unexpected triumph",9,16 February 2009,"If there is anything director Danny Boyle seemingly refuses to do, it is play to expectations. Following a slew of praise circling around his recent delving into science fiction (superb zombie film 28 Days Later and existential space travel film Sunshine), it is hard to imagine a project more out of left field for Boyle than a game show centered romance set in India. But however unconventional it may appear, the conviction and passion Boyle invested into what is arguably his strongest piece of cinema makes Slumdog Millionaire, much like its subject matter, seemingly overcome all obstacles and adversities to end up as the almost universally recognized smash hit of the year. Upon attempting in to zero in on the film's massive source of appeal, it would seem that it is the odd juxtaposition between the gritty urban realism of its setting and magic realism of its central conceit which makes the film such an appealing oddity. What might have emerged as a relatively typical story of underdog romance in a different setting or set of circumstances is transformed into an honest, pathos tinged yet triumphantly uplifting hymn to life and persistence through adversity. Boyle's emphasis on the hardships of growing up in a poverty stricken Indian slum makes protagonist Jamal's inevitable triumph all the more jubilant, as the audience's sympathies are so resoundingly behind him after surviving his incredible, harrowing journey together. After two hours of struggle, hardships and despair, one can't help but earnestly wish for him to overcome the obstacles in his path and have his stubbornly single-minded determination be rewarded by the sort of happy ending only the movies could truly deliver, making what otherwise may have proved a cop out of a happy ending instead a rejuvenating entry into the pantheon of movie magic. Of course the technical plaudits of Boyle's film are inescapably masterful, combining A.R. Rahman's pulsating powerful musical score and director of photography Anthony Dod Mantle's raw, violently mobile Scorsese-esq camera-work for a depiction of Indian slums erupting into urgent cinematic life. Dealing with potentially tricky setting, Boyle deals with his subject matter with the utmost of sensitivity and tastefulness, never exploiting the poverty to the point of formulating an urban testament to the horrors of humanity's excesses, but instead driving home his dramatic point while still extracting a hauntingly beautiful as well as chilling aesthetic out of mountains of garbage, violence and destitution. However, beautiful or not, the film is often a difficult watch, with Boyle refusing to shy away from some of the more brutal aspects of Indian slum life, including orphaned beggar children having their eyes put out with hot spoons to attract more pity and money from passers by, and the infamous torture sequence where Jamal is interrogated under suspicion of cheating at the game show. Far from being senseless, these moments of brutality establish a deadly reality to the tone of fantasy romance which might otherwise overtake the film, keeping an appealingly balanced and understated tone throughout. Nonetheless, countless plaudits or not, the film is hardly perfect, as it cannot be denied that the basic premise of Jamal's life experiences coincidentally serving to provide him with the answers to each ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"" question strains credulity to excessive points (as well as the latter questions of the game-show coming across as conspicuously easy to fit the narrative), but so firmly does Boyle manoeuvre audience sentiment that this potentially hokey approach instead becomes one the viewer urgently wants to subscribe to, regardless of the plausibility of it. Similarly, for all of the screenplay's strengths, for the sake of narrative speed or cohesion, character development occasionally suffers. Moreover, the ""history/social context of India in point form"" approach through telling Jamal's life through flashbacks may prove unsatisfying to some viewers, but Boyle's neat cinematic sweeps, daring sentiment and punctuations of brutal honesty and realism make the film a lasting, troubling and eventually supremely satisfying experience. Co-director/casting director Loveleen Tandon's influence becomes most prominent through the selection and direction of the film's exceptional cast, who contribute an alluring energy and authenticity to the complex subject matter, unquestionably bringing the film to life. Dev Patel is truly heart-warming as the stoically irrepressible Jamal - while initial criticisms may dismiss him as overly bland, over time the harsh reality to Jamal emerges, and what at first might seem a lack of emotion later becomes apparent as a protective exterior of stoic resolution. Patel knowingly interjects with moments of caustic fury or sly wit which add nuance and substance to a tortured character, making Jamal instead one of the most inspirational pieces of characterization of the year. Similarly, the luminous Freida Pinto makes Jamal's love interest truly human in the midst of the horrors beset her, making their unconventional budding romance just quirky and understated enough to work, and not be consumed by melodrama. Despite an underwritten character, Madhur Mittal builds layers of devastating depth to Jamal's Jamal's ruthless, self-serving but ultimately human brother Salim, refusing to bank on antagonistic conventions and keeping his character frustratingly yet believably complex throughout. The supremely talented child performers playing the lead trio at earlier installments of their lives also demonstrate surprising versatility and authenticity, maintaining a human context to the troublesome story. Finally, backing up the lead performers, Anil Kapoor is slickly despicable yet perversely charming as the host of the Indian incarnation of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"". The combination of flashy, operatic exteriors and the old fashioned, intimate story lying on the interior make Slumdog Millionaire a winner, melding unashamed sentiment with enough realist social context to make it uplifting without being a guilty pleasure. While advising seeing the film may seem slightly redundant considering the swarms of critical praise circling it, reflection and distancing from the hype still reveal a film, which, while hardly perfect, has more than enough unassuming charm to warrant the recognition.-9/10",Slumdog Millionaire
116,Sirus_the_Virus,One of the best films of 2008.,10,22 September 2009,"I loved the best picture winner Slumdog millionaire. I mean, it wasn't my favorite film of 2008, but it was one of them. The film is was, uplifting, romantic, and many other things. It really was a great film. I think it may be a bit overrated, but really not that much. Slumdog millionaire has a unique way of story telling and it's a unique film all together.Young star Dev Patel stars as Jamal, a young man who had a troubled life in the Slums of Mumbai. The film focuses about him and his brother Salim, and Jamal's friend and love Natika(Freida Pinto). Jamal is on Who wants to be a millionaire. When he is accused of cheating, they interrogate him into telling them how he knew the answers. He knows all of the answers because a lot of them happened or something that reminds him of something from his past. Slumdog millionaire is a great film. I see why it won best picture, because of all of the nominated films of 2008, I think it was one of the better ones. I didn't like it as much as The Dark Knight or Doubt, but I liked it more than the overrated Benjamin Button and I liked it more than The Reader, which was another great film. It was a good film season in 2008, and Slumdog millionaire was one of the best.Slumdog millionaire:****/****",Slumdog Millionaire

Certainly, this is a subjective question, but after experiencing this wondrous achievement, I can't imagine anyone picking another film but this as best picture of 2008. British director Danny Boyle perfectly crafted this picture and it is more than just a great story but also a great movie. It is entirely entertaining and will certainly lift your spirits as well. All the actors, whether Dev Patel as Jamal, Freida Pinto as Latika, or any of the rest of the cast, young and old, are perfectly cast and completely bring us into this world of poverty, dirtiness, sadness, and hope.So, I say you must see Slumdog Millionaire before the Oscars are announced. I can say with confidence it will win Best Picture, but you owe it to yourself to experience the expert storytelling, acting, directing, visual style, and music that wraps you up and transports you to a feeling of exhilaration and joy.

Some people were even hailing it as one of the best movies ever, and it's easy to see why. It is a superbly written and produced film with an uplifting and thoroughly engaging storyline. Dev Patel delivers a near faultless performance as Jamal, though the entire cast are terrific.'Slumdog Millionaire' is one of those films that you hear so many positive things about and are somewhat reluctant to watch in case it lets you down. But unlike a lot of other hyped up movies, this one lives up to expectations. It grabs your attention from the start and keeps you absorbed right until the end. It takes a special kind of movie to successfully achieve that.This is undeniably a great film that deserves the praise it gets. It's not one of my personal favourites but I thoroughly enjoyed it nonetheless.",Slumdog Millionaire
120,Philby-3,Colorful saga from a fast-changing land,9,27 December 2008,"Danny Boyle is a versatile director, having done productions as diverse as Inspector Morse episodes, the mordant comedy-drama ""Shallow Grave"", a celebration of the junkie lifestyle in ""Trainspotting, misadventures on the hippie trail in ""The Beach"", plausible science fiction in ""Sunshine"" and this colorful Indian romantic fable based on Vikas Swarup's novel ""Q&A"". It's Bollywood meets Hollywood all right, but there's also a little of the British Ealing comedy in it, where the good little guy takes on the bad establishment. He does so as a contestant in the Indian version of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"".A cynic might say that all we have here is another way to exploit the ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"" franchise, since one of the production companies, Celador (now itself owned by Sony Pictures), also owns the TV show which is given plenty of screen time here. But Jamal Malik (Dev Patel from ""Sins""), 18 year old Mumbai slum dweller and and chai wallah tea boy) in a call centre, has non-monetary reasons for wanting to win the contest. He seeks instead to win the affections of his childhood friend, Latika (Frieda Pinto), a rose from the gutter who has fallen into the hands of an obnoxious gang boss, Javed (Mahesh Manjrekar).The story is cleverly framed around the quiz questions. Jamal gets each answer right because each question happens ('it is written"") to be connected with an incident in his own life (fortunately more or less in chronological order). He manages to convince the policeman who has arrested him for fraud (how could a slumdog answer all those questions?) that he is on the level. The climax of the story is the last question. Unbeknown to Jamal, Latika is watching and - not far away.The two hours running time is filled with people, incident, noise and music. There's even an interlude at the Taj Mahal, where Jamal briefly becomes a (very) unofficial guide.) I note the film has not been released in India, and given the stark portrayal of some of the less attractive aspects of life there (police malpractice and corruption, communal violence, stinking slums and wide-scale gangsterism) I doubt it ever will  appearances are everything on the sub-continent. Unlike films such as ""Earth"" and ""Water"", serious pieces made for Indian audiences but banned or never screened there, Slumdog Millionaire, despite the almost all Indian cast and crew, is a Westerner's view from someone who knows how to make squalor entertaining. Danny Boyle doesn't care who he offends as long as he entertains. The last almost post-credits scene of hundreds dancing on the railway platforms to Abba-like music says it all. This is one cheeky film director. But in Noel Coward's words, he has a talent to amuse.I'm not sure what impact a film like this has on tourism  it might repel as many as it attracts  but one thing does emerge very clearly  India and countries like it (eg China) are changing faster than we imagine. Your correspondent recently spent a few days in Abu Dhabi. This Persian gulf oil sheikdom has gone from a few grass huts to a shining modern (if car dominated) city of nearly a million people in less than 40 years  most of the work having been done by ""guest-workers"" from Muslim South Asia. Is it not possible that in 40 years time the slums of Mumbai will be history, just as Dicken's London has become?",Slumdog Millionaire
121,gizmomogwai,"The audience loves Jamal, I did not",6,16 December 2014,"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? was a show that took the US and Canada by storm in 2002. It was sensational, suspenseful, dramatic, immense (a million dollars!) and made for one heck of an event. But as Regis Philbin admitted, the network needed to make it a regular show rather than a rare event. The novelty wore off.A few years later, here's a film, Best Picture-winner at that, trying to recreate that feeling. Jamal is a character on the Indian version of the show. But when the question is posed at the beginning- how is Jamal winning so much money- my sentiment was still, ""Who cares?"" As the film then goes through Jamal's life story and how it provides him with the information that comes in handy in the game show, I still never built an attachment to his story. There is a story here, not necessarily a bad one, but who is our hero? A rather flat character to whom things happen- he doesn't come across as much of a person, a send-in for ourselves. The same can be said of his love interest, Latika. Even as a story about poverty in a foreign culture and the descent into criminal life, there's not much here than can hold a candle to, say, City of God (2002). How Slumdog Millionaire wraps it up- destiny in finding a lost love, destiny in picking a random answer and getting it right- appears to have inspired much of its audience, but I didn't find it believable and was unmoved.",Slumdog Millionaire
122,jaredmobarak,"Dreams of so many, on the floor  Slumdog Millionaire",10,9 December 2008,"With this new film, Slumdog Millionaire, the Boyle treats us to a touching love story, backdropped into a world of crime and poverty in Mumbai, India. It is such a simple tale, yet told in gorgeous flashback, peeling back layers when necessary and enhancing the relationships between our lead Jamal and those around him; those on his ""friends and family"" plan. Here is a young man from the streets, a boy who witnessed his own mother's murder, living only to be reunited with the one person he truly loves, Latika. His bond to her leads him on an adventurous life full of violence and cruelty, events so harrowing that one would be hard-pressed to forget even the smallest detail about them. This is a great fact for Jamal as it will soon be shown how his life was lived with a destiny to be achieved. When he becomes a contestant on ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"", it's as though the questions were written especially for him.Accused of cheating and arrested by the police, (talk about rights violations, at least we have rights in America), he is tortured to discover how he was able to trick the system. Only when nothing yields results does the Inspector, (the great Irfan Khan), decide to hear Jamal out and find the truth. What transpires is the film we have come to watcha story told from a police chair, one of how the rough and tumble life of a slumdog gave him the exact right experiences to keep going towards a purse of twenty million rupees. Boyle, never one to go conventional, cuts between flashbacks of childhood, (the actual event being remembered), with Jamal in the hotseat on television, thinking of his past tragedies to continue the game as long as he can, in hopes that his love is watching, wherever she may be. With gorgeous cuts at the startflashes of memories jumbled together as he is submerged in water or electrocutedthe structured chaos soon calms down to a normal pathway of three converging timelines: childhood, the previous night's game show, and the present incarceration. We are shown exactly what we need at exactly the right time. The film couldn't have been shot any other way and be nearly as successful as it is.It all began in the slums with Jamal and his brother Salim. The two were inseparable no matter how much the older sibling would wreck the younger's joy for his own laughter. They always believed in each other, even though they took diverging paths in life, the bond was never broken. These two Musketeers did what they needed to survive, looking out for one another and also for their surrogate third ""brother"" Lakita. Separated often, the three had a knack for finding one another through the years, until an event risks shattering any love between the brothers  an event that proves crucial to what characters do once the final trivia question is asked. Only when the bottom drops and one sees the monster they have become can he finally try to make amends. It's a journey through time that proves how strong love is. Money is meaningless unless there is a life to live spending it. Who knows, if you live your life correctly, without regret, good things can happen. One doesn't necessarily need to seek fortune in order to earn it and that fortune doesn't always have to be monetary.Boyle orchestrates it all with a steady hand, creating stunning visuals with composition, editing, (especially the numerous chase scenes on foot), and tempo changes; adding mood with a stellar soundtrack, (I'm enjoying it as I write); and allowing his actors to breathe free and give some powerfully natural performances. You have to give all those involved credit, for controlling three different actors as each of our three leads, all of which stay true to each other, never allowing you to believe they aren't the same person just at different stages of their lives. Straight across the board, Jamal, Salim, and Latika are three-dimensional people trying to survive, no matter what they must do. I really enjoyed the youngest Salim, Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail, with his infectious and mischievous smile when he tricks his brother, and also the middle incarnation by Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala, a boy at the crossroads of a path towards salvation or a descent ending with an eternity in the slum. Freida Pinto's oldest Latika is wonderful as the troubled girl knowing only the kindness of one man, a man that she pushes away in fear of his death should they run away. However, it is Dev Patel's Jamal that steals the show. With his blank stare and unceasing drive to find his love, Patel pushes on through it all. Severing ties and mending others to get closer to his dream, this young man never strays from his quest and you can see the wheels turning behind his eyes, calculating his next step.A tale of destiny and striving to be good, Slumdog Millionaire is an uplifting parable showing how karma works. Everything happens for a reason, nothing is left to chance. Perhaps it is all written, but that doesn't make the journey any tougher to endure. Jamal could have, understandably, given up at many times in his life, but his drive would not allow him that convenience. Conquering all odds, coming from the streets, to the point he didn't even know Ghandi's face was on his own country's currency, Jamal gets the chance at a fortune and an opportunity to finally be free. I seriously found myself hoping he'd get the final question correct; it engrossed me that much. You'll have to watch yourself to find out.",Slumdog Millionaire
123,hall895,Rather dire and very contrived,6,18 August 2010,"In all the various international versions of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? a few things remain constant. One of those things is that the show is not broadcast live. Except in this movie. That's just the first of many contrivances you have to be willing to accept if you're going to watch Slumdog Millionaire. This movie asks you to believe so many unbelievable things. The fact that the game show upon which the whole plot is centered plays out in a way that is quite frankly impossible is a problem. The game show being broadcast live isn't the only issue. Other key moments of the game within the movie play out in a way which, back in the real world, simply could not and would not happen. So the very heart of the movie brings with it incredible flaws. Some may say let it go, it's just a movie, you're thinking too much. That would probably be easier if the setup of the game show itself was the only major contrivance. It's not. This movie piles contrivance upon contrivance to the point the whole thing strains credulity.The movie tells the story of Jamal Malik, a young man from the Mumbai slums who rather unbelievably is on the verge of winning Millionaire's grand prize. The show's host certainly doesn't believe it. He's convinced Jamal is cheating and hands him over to the police who are to beat the truth out of him. Doctors, lawyers, the best and brightest of India's society have gone on the show and been stumped. But Jamal, the simple slumdog, somehow has all the answers. And we, and his interrogators, are about to find out how exactly that came to be. We flashback to Jamal's childhood and then, as we watch him grow into a man, see the incidents in his life which enabled him to know the answers to every question he was asked. It's an interesting story to be sure but so contrived in so many ways. It's just too perfect that every question has a corresponding event in Jamal's life. And the fact that the key incidents in Jamal's life proceed chronologically in the same order in which the corresponding questions are asked on the show? Very convenient that. This whole movie has more than a hint of impossibility to it.So it's contrived but maybe that's OK because Slumdog Millionaire is, as the film's marketing breathlessly tells you, the feel-good film of the decade. Really? This is the most bleak, dire feel-good movie I've ever seen. Jamal has led a life filled with unimaginable hardship. Hardship which is portrayed in unsparing, brutal fashion. People love a rags-to-riches underdog story and that's what we have here. But if the film is destined to be ultimately inspiring, and that's clearly what the filmmakers are going for, it sure is rather depressing along the way. Depressing and all too often not particularly entertaining. The flashback structure comes off as somewhat gimmicky and robs the film of much of its momentum. You're interested in Jamal's story but never completely captivated. There's not enough energy in the movie for it to really grab you. The key romantic storyline falls a little flat as the girl over whom Jamal obsesses is someone who in actuality he hardly knows at all. For most of his life he has had no relationship whatsoever with this girl. That makes it hard to sell this as some kind of great romance. Eventually the flashbacks catch up to Jamal's present-day life which sets up the big conclusion. But by that point the movie has kind of fizzled out. It's already been robbed of any joy that it might have had. Honestly the only time this movie enjoys itself at all is during the closing credits. And by then it's much too late. It's not as much of a feel-good movie as it's purported to be. It's certainly not as entertaining or enjoyable as it could have been. And the story is so contrived. Honestly if you think about it the whole thing doesn't make much sense at all. Somehow despite all of that the movie doesn't fail completely. There's enough good stuff here to make the movie passable but that's about it.",Slumdog Millionaire
124,Karl Self,Indian Love Story,5,8 July 2010,"Slumdog Millionaire tells a fairy tale of a young Indian ""slumdog"" (i. e. slum dweller) who wins his childhood love, alongside a handsome cash prize of two million rupees, through the Indian edition of the internationally popular game show ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"". With each question, we get to see another chapter from his life, starting as a young kid working on a skip, until we return to the present of him working as a humble chai wallah (the Indian male version of a tea and cakes lady) in a call center.I'm a big fan of Danny Boyle, and as usual his visual style packs a lot of punch. But this time the story is terribly thin and cheesy. Romantic as it may be, I don't buy that someone can fall in love at the age of about 6, and for this love to work when he's a young man. And I don't buy that someone who barely learned to read and write can win the jackpot at WWTBAM.That's not ""modern fairy tale"", that's just bad storytelling. Sorry.",Slumdog Millionaire
125,crossbow0106,Experience Is Everything..But,5,14 December 2008,"Having read about all the critics falling over themselves praising this film, I thought I would be greatly entertained. I was, but only mildly. The story of a contestant on ""Millionaire"" whose knowledge all stems from experiences in his life is a great idea, but by the end of the film I just did not care enough about him to see whether he would take the prize or not. I don't think Jamal's character is particularly sympathetic or likable enough for me to be behind him. The relationship with Latika was, to me, not explored all that well. I was in a theater with a fairly sizable audience and no one laughed. I shrugged my shoulders throughout. Well made as it is, it just didn't matter to me what happened to Jamal. Thats unfortunate. Thats why I recommend the film as a film that has merit in its execution but little merit in its characters. I wouldn't want to know anyone in this film. Thats why I didn't love it, only kind of liked it.",Slumdog Millionaire
126,Andy-296,Not great - but far better than it sounds,6,8 March 2009,"On the face of it, this British made film (winner of a best picture Oscar) sounds a terrible mixture of unbelievable melodrama, full of improbable coincidences, and western condescension. A teenage boy, raised on India's awful slums, manage to win millions in a tacky quiz show by answering all the questions, neither of them terrible hard. He knows the answers, not from having read about them, but from having learned in life about them (for example, he knows who invented the revolver from a shootout he was once involved). From the first scene, where the protagonist is tortured with electric wires to find out if he's a cheat, to the very end, when his lifelong female friend crosses a busy street to reach a cell phone in order to tell him in extremis the answer that will let him win the show, the whole film is ridiculous, sentimental, manipulative, condescending...and yet, this film is nowhere as bad as it sounds, and despite all its low punches, it is eminently watchable. Maybe this has to do with the actor's earnest performances, but this film ends up reaching a deeper emotional chord than it should have. Recommended with reservations.",Slumdog Millionaire
127,vip_ebriega,Sure feels like a million rupees!,10,21 December 2009,"My Take: The Best Picture winner of 2008 an enjoyable and uniquely-told rags-to-riches story. Saying anything, good or bad, about Danny Boyle's SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE won't be nothing more than a preaching with the crowd, not that it would affect the film's reputation. With an overwhelming response to its viewers, SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE has since become almost critic-proof upon its release. It was a critic and awards darling which eventually swept most of the awards it was nominated for. It was indeed a success, which is much to say for a movie that's simply about a story of an underdog winning 20 million rupees.So what makes SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE such a great movie? Is it the masses' hankering to see a simple rags-to-riches story? Is it the eventual word of mouth that spread afterward? And if it was that last one, what would have made such a word of mouth even spread? Well in my opinion, the strength of SLUMDOG might have not just been on the story, but more on the telling. The story of SLUMDOG has already become something common: It's about Jamal (Dev Patel), an 18-year old teen who has lived on the streets of Mumbai all his life. But when he enters the Mumbai version of ""Who Wants to Be A Millionaire"", without having a formal education. Did he cheat? Probably. That's why before the winning last question, he is kidnapped by guys who want him to confess. Is he a genius? Probably, but he does need help from the audience when asked about the meaning of emblem of India. Or perhaps, is it destiny that's driving him to the finish line? The story could probably be anyone's underdog story, and yet on the screen, it isn't. The film sports an indie-film look, where the cinematography, lighting and even music accurately captures a Bollywood film. There's even a lively dance sequence during the finale. You swear Boyle has done this sort of thing before! The soundtrack is wonderful too. But sporting style over substance would be nothing to the audience if it doesn't really do much for the story. SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE may have added style to its story, but in the end its the story that rings true. Audiences could easily involve themselves with the characters and their plights. In telling the story, Boyle has not just made it visually stunning and inviting, he has made it effective and effectively entertaining.Rating: ***** out of 5.",Slumdog Millionaire
128,CitizenCaine,Slumdog Wants To Be A Millionaire,9,1 March 2009,"The accolades for Slumdog Millionaire are many, and they criss cross the globe coming from people from all walks of life. Many people from the region protest the film as undignified and patronizing to the region where they live. Danny Boyle, the Oscar-winning director of the film, combines unknown actors, a largely unknown region of the world (to most people in the United States), crisp cinematography, editing, and sound to tell the story of Jamal, a Mumbai teenager, and how he ends up on the Indian version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? Each of the answers to the questions he's asked are rooted in his past, and the audience learns where the young Jamal has come from. Along the way, Jamal falls in love with a childhood friend (Latika) and spends the rest of his life (his life to that point) searching for her. The film is consistently compelling and entertaining, despite a conscious effort to somewhat sanitize its subject matter.The film's juxtaposition between aspects of the television show and the harsh realities of Jamal's life are often jarring, but ultimately the film disappoints us by stumbling over the many contrivances necessary to reach the film's Bollywood-like conclusion. The characters are all mostly either all good or all bad. The film utilizes elements of Oliver Twist, Romeo & Juliet, and Bollywood films to sprint to its predictable conclusion. For those of you who think the plot's unfolding is so great, have you asked yourself why Jamal continued to return to both Latika and Salim after being treated in such a despicable manner? Have you wondered why Jamal wanted to continue to ""save"" Latika after she refused Jamal's request to join him, indicating ""and live on what""? How about why Salim suddenly changed his tune and assisted Jamal in his rescue plan? These are only a few of the film's many contrivances. Although the film is definitely over-rated as an ultimate feel-good romantic film, it's still an above average film in terms of drama and suspense with some comic bits. The Oscar-winning song ""Jai Ho"", which has nothing to do with anything in the film, is tacked on for the end credits. It won eight Oscars, including best picture and screenplay. ***1/2 of 4 stars.",Slumdog Millionaire

I felt that way. So a ton of crap happens to our protagonists. Too much to be realistic.And yet is just so well done that I don't mind.
The pacing (and editing) is ridiculously good. You can't wait to see what's going to happen next.In the end. It might not be the most refined movie ever (again, way too many contrived things happen, plus too many terrible things involve the same set of characters, and the ending is...not subtle), but is well done regardless of that.",Slumdog Millionaire
130,Stampsfightclub,Boyle generates feel good motive in stunningly set drama,8,17 June 2009,"Jamal Malik (Patel) is accused of cheating on Who Wants to be a Millionaire with one question left and when questioned by authorities, he recounts his life story.Danny Boyle's 2008 Oscar winner brought many to see the light in the dark dramas of the other Oscar potentials amongst David Fincher's Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Ron Howard's Frost/Nixon. All strong conceptual dramas and amongst these stood the Englishman's sentimental feel good picture about an apparent cheat on a game show that delighted viewers all over the world.Filmed in Mumbai, Slumdog is a complex rags to riches story that shines with a warm intensity whilst generating a strong drama of life in the slums of India with Boyle once more establishing himself as one of the finest scenery directors to grace our screens.At first the Oscar dominator starts as a slow paced establisher by bringing out the sequence of the present of Dev Patel's Jamal being punished in Prison, through a literally shocking manor. From there he starts explaining his life story and how he came to be on Who Wants to be a Millionaire and how he was doing everything for one person.Danny Boyle certainly handles flashbacks exceptionally well. From Trainspotting to The Beach he swerves the story into a conundrum of possibilities and expectations. As we travel back and forth through events we learn more and more about the accused and Boyle again is establishing the character to fit our viewing requirements. From the desperate surge of rivalry with his brother to the desperation of finding his lost love, Jamal's sentimental plot resounds around the tightly woven Oscar winning script.What is astonishing about this film however is Boyle's direction and never before has an Oscar been more deserved. From the sharp sweeping shots of India to the sophisticated televised moments Boyle's continuity is to be greatly appreciated as the way the story flows in comparison to Boyle's established scenery setting helps generate the importance and hardness of growing up in the slums and being the most popular person in India.Dev Patel's first major role is vastly different from his beautifully lively Anwar in Skins. The sentiment and repressed desire fits exquisitely to the story's emotional core whilst Frieda Pinto gives good balance.There are flaws in this picture. The first part of the film is immensely boring and the pace and energy of the situation takes a while to generate the feeling of proclaimed ""destiny"". Anil Kapoor is exceptionally annoying as the TV presenter whilst the dance sequence at the very end gives of an unforgivable cheesy vibe.But there can be minimal doubt that Slumdog deserves its praise with a sentimental feel good motive and once more Boyle is on top form with stunning scenery direction.",Slumdog Millionaire
131,fwomp,Bollywood Trumps Hollywood?,10,3 January 2009,"I'm going to try and do this film justice by reviewing it with as keen an eye as I can muster, but I fear I'll still fall far short of the mark ...so here goes...SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is the best movie of the year for a couple of reasons. The first is that it is both compartmentalized and global at the same time. It harkened me back to my love of another favorite film of mine, THE USUAL SUSPECTS, in which a man sits in a police station and tells his story in flashback. But any similarities between these two ends with the police station and their equally excellent scripts (sidenote: The Usual Suspect remains my top favorite film script of all time but this one's pulling up close).Slumdog takes place at a police station as young man named Jamal (Dev Patel) goes through a tortuous interrogation at the hands of India's police force. Having recently been on India's version of ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire""  and answered all of the questions correctly so far  he was whisked off to the local constables office on the possibility of having cheated. The show has had lawyers, doctors, physicists, and many other well-educated people on the show who didn't get as far as Jamal, so how did he  a chai tea delivery boy  get so far (only one more question remains and he'll have his million)? The story is complex, funny, grotesque, horrible and loving, all within the same breath. Each answer comes not from Jamal's limited education, but from his time on India's hard-bitten streets where he grew up an orphan along with his brother, Salim (Madhur Mittal). Having watched their mother murdered during a religious uprising against Muslims, Jamal and Salim had to make their way in the world on their own, their paths separating wildly and then re-merging, often years later. But during their younger days as little kids, they encountered a pretty young orphan girl named Latika (the amazingly beautiful Freida Pinto), whom Jamal finds an instant fascination with. And it is his fascination and love for her that will drive him for the rest of his young life ...which include his chances on the millionaire show. Separated time and again (including thanks to the departure from his brother as he falls in with some very bad gangsters), Jamal never gives up his quest to be with her, even when it seems impossible.It is Jamal's remembrances of his street life that are the hardest to watch, making for some gritty scenes (and some funny ones, including a scene where Jamal must jump down a latrine hole in order to escape and get a much-wanted autograph from a local movie star). Forced child labor is nothing new in India's slums, and it is brought into nauseating focus as we watch kids beaten, deformed (""Blind singers earn twice as much"") and sent onto the streets to beg for money ...all at the hands of adults wanting to take advantage no matter the cost.The stories back and forth nature (like the aforementioned The Usual Suspects) was a great way to show Jamal's life in a bubble. The audience really, really, really cared for him and wanted to see him win (the show I went to had audience members applauding  loudly  when the film ended), showing how well the script was put together and how well acted the film was by these relative unknowns (the only actor I was familiar with was Irrfan Khan who was in another favorite Bollywood film of mine entitled THE NAMESAKE ...note: see that movie, too!) Hollywood should take note of this film, and apparently has as the Golden Globes have come out with their nominations (2008) and listed it among four categories (Best Director, Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Original Score, and Best Screenplay).One final note: This film is truly an independent, tolling in at $15 million for production costs. I've seen much, much lesser films (in terms of quality) that had a budget ten times that. But one can't forget that filming in India is much cheaper than here in the States. Still, Hollywood, take notice! This is what great cinema is all about.Oscars! Here comes Bollywood!",Slumdog Millionaire
132,jon.h.ochiai,It's About the Girl,10,9 February 2009,"Young Jamal (Dev Patel) is a contestant on the verge of winning 20 million rupees on the Indian version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" How it is it possible that orphaned ""slumdog"" Jamal can answer all the questions so far, when so many others have failed? Sergeant Srinivas (stalwart Saurabh Shukla) would also like to know, in his interrogation of suspected cheat Jamal. I had heard about much of the storyline of Director Danny Boyle's ""Slumdog Millionaire"" prior to finally seeing it. The ""Millionaire"" game show plot device initially on the surface seems contrived, as a way for Writer Simon Beaufoy to explore the story of Jamal through a series of riveting and captivating flashbacks.However, about half an hour through the movie I got it: ""It's about the girl."" Perhaps, midway through, there is a scene of movie magic where direction, story, and performance culminate together. Jamal waits for the love of his life Latika (stunningly beautiful Freida Pinto) at the train station. Jamal is distraught thinking Latika has dismissed him. Suddenly, she arrives. She looks up and sees Jamal, and lets out a smile. Not a word is spoken. It's about the girl.""Slumdog Millionaire"" is a timeless love story, and the best movie of the year. ""Slumdog Millionaire"" follows the story of Jamal, Latika, and Jamal's older brother Salim (Madhur Mittal) from the time they were orphaned children to now. Theirs is a story of tragedy, innocence lost, courage, and love. Danny Boyle is the mesmerizing and poignant storyteller. Simon Beaufoy's screenplay based on the novel ""Q & A"" by Vikas Swarup is beautiful and touching. All the actors, who play the lead characters at various stages of their lives, are amazing and authentic. Boyle generates the enrolling spirit throughout ""Slumdog Millionaire""-- the story he tells is passionate and inspiring.Jamal and Salim become orphans as children following a Muslim massacre. They befriend orphaned Latika. Latika is destined to become the love of Jamal's life. They are all taken in by a ruthless group that enslaves children as beggars. Jamal and Salim manage to escape, but lose Latika. Years later Jamal and Salim rescue Latika, but at the cost of Salim's very soul. Salim chooses the dark path, one from which he can not return. Jamal is really now alone. His redemption may lie in ""Millionaire"", but not for the obvious reasons. His is for love and for Latika.Eventually, Jamal reunites with Salim and grown up Latika. Life has not turned out as all had envisioned. At the story arc Jamal confesses to Latika, ""I love you."" She replies, ""It's too late."" She implores Jamal, ""Forget me."" Dev Patel and Freida Pinto are amazing, and the heart and soul of ""Slumdog Millionaire"". Yes, it's about the girl. More to the point: it's about the power of the human spirit, and love. There is tremendous pain and suffering, and at the same time deep compassion, selfless sacrifice, and redemption. ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is a very special movie.",Slumdog Millionaire
133,cultfilmfan,Slumdog Millionaire,9,25 January 2009,"Slumdog Millionaire is based upon the novel Q & A by Vikas Swarup. The film takes place in India and is centered around a young man named Jamal Malik who has just made it onto the Indian version of the popular television game show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire. As the show goes along we are told in flashback scenes of Jamal growing up in the slums of India and eventually falling in love with a girl named Latika. Jamal's past experiences whether they were good, or bad, have helped shape his life and provide the answers to many of the questions in the television game show that he is now on. Jamal has had a lot of difficult times in his life, but through personal growth and determination he wants to take the top prize and get in touch with Latika who he has not seen for years. Early last fall I remember reading on several different movie websites that Slumdog was definitely going to be nominated for several Oscars and become a huge crowd pleasing hit. Back at that time I knew very little about the film, but those early predictions were right as the film is now nominated for ten Oscars, has won tons of other awards and is on many critics' top ten lists as one of the best films of last year. I wanted to see the film quite badly, so I repeatedly e-mailed my local theatre to see if they would get the film. They replied back with an article from The New York Times entitled Films Reach Theaters a Drib Here, Drab There by Michael Cieply. The theatre closest to my home did not get Slumdog, but another one not so far away did and that is where I saw it. Overall, I quite liked it. I would not go as far as saying it is one of my favourite films of the year, or the best of the nominated films, but I did like it. The script having been based on a novel is very original and I liked how we saw Jamal grow up in a very harsh and disturbing way, but to grow out of it and become what could be a huge star. The film shows the greed, corruption and danger he has to go through along the way and I found it all quite interesting and it almost played out like a modern day fable with a good lead character, many villains and untrustworthy people along the way as well as a big prize at stake. Not too mention the love story aspect of the script as well. All of this worked for me and did a fairly good job of keeping my interest and involving me with the characters and the story. Visually this film was quite spectacular as well. It had a gritty tone in some scenes and is bright and illuminated in others. The cinematography, visuals and fast paced editing gave the film a certain style and I for one really liked it and found it appropriate to the story and overall movie. A lot of the actors in the film did quite a good job and I think the location shooting in India shooting the scenes showing Jamal's upbringing was quite well done and needs to be acknowledged as well. Sometimes, I felt Slumdog had a little more style than it did an involving story, but there were still times where I was quite fascinated by what was going on in front of me and there was so much to admire here that I found it hard not to give this film a favourable review. While not my favourite film of the year I still found lots to like about Slumdog Millionaire and for the more curious of filmgoers it is definitely worth seeing once, or perhaps twice to truly appreciate it.",Slumdog Millionaire
134,Rogue-32,(d) It is written,9,31 January 2009,"Highly acclaimed and rightfully so, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" has one of the most unique structures of any film I've seen: the main character, Jamal  a superb performance from the young Dev Patel  is on television, on India's version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire. He is presented with the questions and we are shown, through extensive, vivid and sometimes brutally shocking flashbacks of his incredible life experiences, how he has come to know each of the answers.Without giving away too much, we see how Jamal and his brother Salim grow up in the slums of Mumbai, India, where they meet Latika. Jamal and Latika realize very early on that they are soulmates, and the film, we find, is actually at its heart a story of how of the power of their love survives all of the many (and there are many) obstacles thrown in their way. It also reminds us, brilliantly, through the structure of how Jamal has come to know the answers to the questions on the game show, that in life, things do happen the way they're meant to happen, when they're meant to happen  it's the energy of the Universe, which works with our own energy, giving us the tools to achieve exactly what we are seeking, on a deep soul level.Danny Boyle has said in interviews that the city of Mumbai is a city of contradictions, where the slums exist literally in the midst of the more affluent sections, and he wanted to capture that reality. He has most definitely succeeded, both in the film's kinetic energy and in the way the story veers from horrific brutality to lyrical moments of beauty and everything inbetween, sometimes all at once. And Dev Patel is a real find, who can register childlike hope in one second and intense, gritty resolve in the next  a perfectly modulated performance. And the actors who played the 3 characters as children were all brilliant and perfectly cast, as well.I did have a little problem with the writing in some of the off-camera game show scenes, plus in the scenes with the older Jamal and older Latika (the gorgeous Freida Pinto), it seemed that she was older than he was; it turns out she indeed was born nearly 6 years earlier. This sort of detracted from the power of these scenes, for me; if they could have either made Pinto look a little younger or made Patel look a little older, it would have been more effective, I think. It's a dazzling piece of film making, nonetheless, and make sure you stay for the dance sequence, over the end credits. It rocks.",Slumdog Millionaire
135,agmoldham,Very enjoyable,6,17 January 2009,"Danny Boyle has a bit of a hit and miss record directing films. This is very much Boyle on form.Slumdog follows the fortunes of Jamal who is a slum dweller from Mumbai. At it's heart it's a love story between Jamal and Latika told as we watch Jamal's appearance on ""Who Want's to be a millionaire"". Although it tells the story of a tough world it's a feel good movie that lifts the heart. Boyle obviously referenced some of his old movies and the films toilet scene brings back memories a similar scene from Trainspotting.It seems like this movie is going to pick up a number of awards and you can't really object to this as it's very nicely played and has a good script.",Slumdog Millionaire

It's so stunning that it can easily make you miss the fact that underneath it's empty, and none of the characters hold any real depth or interest. Why is it that Tarantino would never get this many Oscars for directing a similar tribute to cinema from Hong Kong or China? It's definitely an impressive piece of cinema, and Boyle's most accomplished visual work, but as storytelling goes it's a decent effort, no more, and definitely not the masterpiece it's made out to be.

137,jem132,Makes you feel like you can touch the sky...or at least win the million!,9,2 February 2009,"The film that's probably going to Best Picture at the Oscar's isn't brilliant, but it's mostly excellent, very enjoyable, and such a crowd-pleaser. Danny Boyle takes a scenario most Western viewers are familiar with (the show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?) and sets it against one underdog slumdog's journey to winning the ultimate prize. Of course I already knew how the film would end (very happy, with dancing all round), because it's a Bollywood hybrid, and the fact that the promo posters are all so brightly coloured and happy looking. You can also tell pretty early on that The Three Muskeeters will be the big question. Even if it is obvious, it's utterly irresistible and that's why audiences and critics are loving it. It took me about 15-20 minutes to adjust to the very frenetic filming style (shot after shot), but I enjoyed it's energy. Dev Patel is cute as the lead.",Slumdog Millionaire
138,jpschapira,"""It's our destiny"" , ""Kiss me""",8,22 February 2009,"""Slumdog Millionaire"" may not be the film you'd expect from someone like Danny Boyle and, although it has some elements that could refuse this statement, it's certainly the riskiest work he's completed, and maybe his best. About this last thing I'm not entirely sure, but if this is the movie that gets him an Academy Award, it's precisely because of not doing the same thing he'd been doing until now.That's right, against all odd, Boyle's little film about a story bigger than life is a classic tale that you'll find yourself defining with many important words: love, poverty, betrayal, friendship, brotherhood, familyDestiny. And the trick my friends is that, among all these beautiful but unlucky people, in this enormous city where the British director took his camera, everything seems perfect; but the viewer who knows Boyle's pessimism can never know for how long it will last. Is it really possible for a guy from the slums to become a millionaire? Can he also get the girl of his dreams? ""The most beautiful woman in the whole world"", that's how Jamal (Dev Patel) speaks about Latika (Freida Pinto), the girl he met when he was living on the streets of Mumbai with his brother Salim (Madhur Mittal); the girl he gave shelter to when he saw her crying under the rain. In the most unusual of circumstances, Jamal will tell a police inspector everything about this girl who he never forgot, his brother and their suffered experience through life. ""I don't know where she is now"", will be the last thing the inspector will hear from him.The movie reveals a lifetime to the viewer's eyes. There's never a clear indication of the moment being showed in this lifetime, but the edition (Chris Dickens) and cinematography (Anthony Dod Mantle, finally recognized) present the structure of the plot and we never get lost. The score by A.R. Rahman, although mostly made of songs and not too showy, sets the mood for every new exotic and captivating location the picture presents by the minute.Three different actors (most of them children and unprofessional) play the main roles in their different ages, but Patel and Pinto stand out because the movie demands it so. The love Jamal has for Latika is what keeps him and ""Slumdog Millionaire"" alive, as he imagines her everywhere and remembers her face constantly.If the movie has a problem it's this one. The constant remembering and repetition of images is an unnecessary reminder of things and a factor of distraction for the viewer in some of the film's most moving scenes. Because, yes, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is moving on its own terms; because in the end it chooses the light and it has its heart in the right place.Maybe you could think there's manipulation involved, but you're wrong; the manipulation occurs inside the story and its structure (and we can't even blame it so much for that because it looks like it really needed it), but there's nothing being forced towards the viewer. Patel's performance makes the love Jamal feels for Latika so sincere and believable that we don't doubt for a second when he tells her he loves her, that it's their destiny to be together, that he will always find her.And yes, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" may not be a true Oscar deserver or a great film, but it is, for the viewer, definitely a well done fairy tale that makes you root for its heroes no matter what; for the critic, a little film that silently and with time wins it heart (of course that works for the viewers too), kind of like ""Juno""; and for institutions like the Academy the picture that, in this time and age, apparently has the virtues to take home the biggest prize they deliver.""Kiss me"", says Latika to Jamal.",Slumdog Millionaire
139,gelman@attglobal.net,Good but not Great,9,27 March 2009,"One never knows what goes through the collective mind of Oscar voters but one suspects that it is the squalor of India -- in this case, Mumbai, though it can also be seen virtually anywhere -- that won this film the Best Picture Award rather than the love story or the contrived ""Who Wants to a Millionaire"" mechanism that contributes the title. Freida Pinto and Dev Patel are a handsome couple, and Danny Boyle is an accomplished director but the star here is the settings and the cinematography which capture the vitality, poverty and violence of the city. The most famous of Mumbai/Bombay landmarks are not shown (or I missed them if they were). Instead of the scenic tour the viewer is confronted with the slums and the impoverished children and the harsh life they lead. One supposes that the love story was required to lift this film out of the documentary realm but it is the reality, not the fictional frame, that delivers the wallop in this film. The quiz show maintains a modicum of tension but one knows how it will come out in fiction if not in fact and the reunion of the young lovers is foreordained -- a Hollywood flower grafted onto a Bollywood stem.",Slumdog Millionaire
140,witster18,This is a great movie.... here's the problem with the detractors.,10,26 December 2008,"Contains MIld Spoilers.Reading through the negative reviews I couldn't help but feel regret that those more associated with Indian culture have turned on this film. I can say that, personally, I can't speak with any knowledge of the subject(Indian Culture and History). I can only say that I don't believe that racial stereotypes were the focus of the director(s) and nor should they be the focus of the viewers. And it is important to note the Boyle doesn't claim to be an expert on India and that he employed the services of many to help him with this vision.However!<, I can say that I have seen over 5,000 films from many different countries including many from India and to say that Slumdog Millionaire DOESN't belong with some of the quality Indian films would be unfair. As for quality(cinematography, music, acting, etc), you would be HARD pressed to find better films than this in India or in America.Fact is, there are poverty stricken people in both countries that could end up in similar circumstances.... and to criticize this film for racial discrimination would be selling this movie short.Slumdog Millionaire is EASILY one of the years best. The film follows the life and struggles of two brothers. One of the finest aspects of the film is how Boyle and Co. found a group of young actors to play the roles of the brothers throughout different segments of their lives. So many times this shows the weaknesses of one group of actors or another, but in Slumdog, they do an equally fine job in each segment.Another unwarranted criticism of Slumdog concerns the plausibility of the film. To say that this could never happen would be like saying that no one ever hits the lottery. Sure, the chips rarely fall into place, but it happens none-the-less. How many times have you watched 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire' and just happened to know some of the huge dollar answers because of happenstance? It happens all the time. The smallest and least significant moments of our lives can be the most enlightening. You just never know when some piece of information you thought you'd never use will become useful.Jamal Malik perseveres because he's tough. He's been through so much that he's wiser.... smarter than he appears... an education outside of the realm of education. At one point in the film his rough childhood is the only reason he gets an answer right... It was a lesson about trust that he learned a long, long time ago. It marked one of many great moments in this film.Slumdog entertains from start to finish. At times it is hard to watch the violence towards the children in this film, but that violence is at the very center of the story. This is definitely not a children's film. The line from 'Shawshank Redemption' comes to mind... ""Andy Dufresne crawled through a mile of the most God awful smell and came out clean on the other side"".... That is Slumdog in a nutshell. I loved this movie. They make movies about poverty, violence against children, and religious upheaval in America and England too.

That's what 2008 Best Picture winner,Slumdog Millionairea,is about-people living in the slums of India. In conditions so atrocious, they make American subsidized housing programs look like Buckingham Palace.The film is about one boy and two storylines entwined into one. The first, he's on a game show and on track to win millions. Then he's arrested on suspicions of cheating and questioned on how he knows. The second is told through flashbacks him growing up in the slums with his brother and love for a girl he met there.

142,deatman9,Great movie but gets a little too romancy.,7,28 October 2012,I only give this movie a seven because near the end it gets really sappy and kind of lame up until then though the movie was really good and actually quite intense. It shows you life in India but its done from a western film style. The actors all did a good job and of course Danny Boyle did some great directing with some stunning cinematography.This movie is about a young man named Jamal that is on the Indian version of who wants to be a millionaire. He is an uneducated slumdog but somehow is answering all the questions right. They clearly suspect him of cheating but he explains through certain life experiences he was able to obtain the answers.I really enjoyed this movie and the ending was not bad it just got a little sappy for my taste I bet a lot of women really liked that scene but was not for me.,Slumdog Millionaire

I enjoyed it a lot.Though the plot seems somewhat stretched, the story goes beyond a coming-of-age story. This is a story of modern-day India as a whole. Loved the setting, love interest, disliked the Bollywood dancing at the end.4/5. 1 star off for the end-credits Bollywood dancing.",Slumdog Millionaire
144,jdkraus,One of this year's best pictures!,10,30 December 2008,"I'll be honest, I did not even hear about this movie until I roamed around on the Internet and found it at IMDb. Seeing that it had a high rating and being nominated for 4 golden globes, I chose to see it. After the two-hour movie flew by, I couldn't help but think how amazing it is. ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is about an orphan who grows up in the slums of Mumbai. It is told through flashback by an 18-year old boy named Jamal as he is questioned by the police of the crime of cheating on the Indian version of ""Who wants to be a Millionaire?"" The movie does follow the typical rags to riches scenario, but it is made creative by the Indian performers who I thought were well excellent in their roles. Dev Patel as Jamal is on his way for a very promising career. In addition to the cast, Danny Boyle's direction not only tells the story but also makes it alive. The way he filmed it made me feel like I was in the slums of India, right in where the people sleep in trash heaps and poop in little outhouses that are right by the river. His use of wide and master shots makes this magic believable. Such use of camera shots, as well as quick editing and close ups helps build the tensions in the scenes throughout the film.At the same time, he captures another India of the wealthy. He reveals the real, modern-day India, unlike films such as ""Passage to India"" or ""Ghandi"". One thing I couldn't help but notice about this film is the work of the photographer. The cinematography is different than any other movie I have seen. There's something very ""surreal"" and vibrant about the lighting and color in the film, as if the sun is the primary source of light (which to a degree is in the outdoor sequences). However, I noticed that in the indoor scenes, this surreal look is still present, particularly based on light sources within those scenes. In addition with the cinematographer, the sound editors put a lot of emphasis on the background noise. This adds more to the authenticity of the film. For instance, when a train goes by at a train station in the movie, it is very, very loud, as it is in real life. But the one thing that is always louder than the field sound is the thunderous and heart pounding score by A.R. Rahman. I will note that his love theme at the end of the movie is very touching and moving. Overall, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is a unique film that explores a world that no one would want to be apart of, yet millions of people live it. There is some very good humor at times and there are some very shocking and disturbing scenes. Not the gory kind like in a war picture, but rather the depictions of starving kids running away stealing and lying to earn money and get food maybe emotionally intense for some people. It is a hard film to watch, but it is a very good one. It's not one for everyone, but I love it and I consider it to be one of this year's best pictures!",Slumdog Millionaire
145,DonFishies,An amazing film you won't easily forget,9,20 January 2009,"Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) is an uneducated young adult, one question away from winning India's version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. But not many people believe an orphan from the slums of Mumbai could ever get that far without cheating. He is arrested, tortured and interrogated under these increasing suspicions. To prove his innocence, Malik tells the police the story of his life, and how he managed to know every answer.Slumdog Millionaire is quite simply, one of the best films of 2008. It tells a timeless and endearing story, and is one of the most unique films of the decade. Danny Boyle, a unique and enigmatic director in his own right, has crafted one hell of an adventure piece that deserves every ounce of praise it has gotten. It starts up, and it is almost a crime to look away.Rather effectively, the film covers Jamal's life with his brother Salim as orphan children of the slums, before moving onto their lives as teenagers scraping together cash and their eventual very different adult selves. The editing is fast-paced for the most part, and the transitions between life cycles are just fabulous. It also manages to capture the relationship between Jamal and Salim quite magnificently through the use of various actors. Whether it is Ayush Mahesh Khedekar and Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail, or Tanay Hemant Chheda and Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala, or Patel and Madhur Mittal, each actor makes their relationship have a deep seated amount of genuine emotion injected into them. And for a group mainly consisting of actors with little to no experience, they do better than anyone could have expected. It is particularly amazing seeing Khedekar and Ismail working together, being so young on the screen but ensuring no one would question the believability of their plight or their relationship as brothers.While fantastical, the film depicts a very dystopic and gritty life of a kid in the slums. But while the film does not all take place in the slums, it still manages to be very vivid in its colour scheme. Cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle and Editor Chris Dickens at once command the screen with beautiful colours in one instance, and then drab, darkened colours in another. Even the jumpy timelines work like I could never have imagined. Anyone who thinks they may end up confusing one time for another will be pleasantly surprised. You would have never expected this was a film primarily made by a group of British filmmakers.But the success of the film mainly hinges on Patel. Without question, he is the absolute best thing about the film. He may not have much experience, but he makes it look like he has acting for years. The emotion he conveys with his face is enough to make any American actor jealous. It is not quite method acting, but he says a lot without even uttering a word. Just watching his expression inside the train station late in the film is enough to make anyone want to weep. He gives just enough emphasis in the areas needed, and stands back and watches everyone else do the same in other instances. This is someone who has a lot of promise, and I would be surprised if he does not walk off with a nomination later this week. He has a lot of promise, and I can only hope he continues after such an amazing performance.The rest of the supporting cast, experienced or not, do a great job with their characters. I would have liked to see a bit more from Mittal, but sadly, his character is already beyond developed by the time he gets to him. Irrfan Khan gives the right amount of menace as the Police Inspector questioning Jamal, and Anil Kapoor does a great job as the skeptical and shady game show host.While the acclaim comes easy, the film does have a few faults. The character of Latika is way too underwritten. We understand early on the bond Jamal has with his fellow orphan, but we never understand any of her motivations or development. She is simply the girl who was there, and who he continued to pine after years later. The themes of fantasy and love are inherent at the very core of Slumdog Millionaire, but with how much we learn about Jamal and Salim, it seems like a bit of a cheat to not really learn much outside of the one-dimensional traits of Latika. Hell, there was more description and volume to the bad guys they encounter than there was for her. I will admit however, that Freida Pinto does an excellent job as the adult Latika, portraying her with plenty of finesse.It is also easy to come down on how much seems to be left to the imagination, or is merely explained in a sentence (how he even managed to get on the show stays a mystery), but the film compacts down so much that it becomes easy to forget what is not mentioned, and even easier to forget what was. Its two hour running time is by no means breezy (nor is it as agonizingly boring as The Curious Case of Benjamin Button), but it lacks the ability to feel cohesive at the end. Not everything gels together. Fantasy or not, it leaves a little too much out. As much as I enjoyed it, it feels incomplete in certain areas, like it wanted to accomplish even more if it had the money or the resources.Slumdog Millionaire is an excellently well done film, worthy of all the recognition it is getting. It may not be perfect, but this fantasy-adventure will draw you in like no other. The film excels where very few did in 2008, and is truly one of the best films of the year. This is not a film that will easily be forgotten.9/10.",Slumdog Millionaire
146,sashank_kini-1,Has its cons but still emerges as a winner,8,30 March 2009,"I saw the movie with my 11 years old sister yesterday long after its release at home. My sister liked it a lot and I too didn't mind it. The thing that worked in Slumdog is that it is appealing. I enjoyed the whole movie and even though I did feel that the Oscars were a bit hasty in giving all the awards ( I haven't seen the other films though), but I do feel that it should have been nominated for many awards, which it was.There were some problems in the movie. The English of the older children with an accent is not understandable. Some cliché scenes and weak dialogues were present. Also, there were some things in the story that could not be understood clearly. Also, I did not feel so much connected with all the character. The host of the show Anil Kapoor was nice at first, then became rude all of a sudden and then became nice in the end!What I liked was that the story was very enjoyable. I could watch the entire movie without yawning. The humor in some sequences was good and didn't look corny. The best acting came from the children. The background score was really good. I do feel that O saaya was a bit better than Jai ho. Also, M.I.A's Paper Planes was great and it perfectly fitted the scene.I'll go with an 8 out of 10 for this movie.",Slumdog Millionaire
147,moviesleuth2,Exhilarating!,8,18 March 2009,"Danny Boyle's ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is at the same time a blur and a rush of color, emotion, and action. It moves so fast that one would think that it would be in danger of getting the audience lost, but no. Boyle may go a little over the top in directorial style, but the audience is with the movie every step of the way.Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) is on India's ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"" Question by question, he gets them all correct and is racking up a huge amount of cash. So much so, that the host (Anil Kapoor) thinks he's cheating. But under interrogation, he reveals how he knows the answers through flashbacks of his life.While the story could (and for the most part, does) succeed on its own, Danny Boyle turns it into a director's show. Mostly, it works. He draws us into the story and keeps things moving. Unfortunately though, sometimes the quick cuts become a bit much, and the frantic pace allows for only limited character development and identification.Fortunately though, his actors are so good that it doesn't matter...almost. The trio of actors that portray Jamal (at various stages in his life) create a protagonist that is impossible not to root for. Likewise, the actors and actresses that play the other two central characters (Latika and Saleem) are very effective as well. The very root of the story is the romance between Jamal and Latika, and the performers deliver (particularly Patel and Frieda Pinto).""Slumdog Millionaire"" is a terrific movie, and though Boyle draws us in and keeps us there, ultimately its the actors who make it special.",Slumdog Millionaire
148,griffolyon12,Danny Boyle's Best Film to Date!,10,26 December 2008,"Slumdog Millionaire is one of those rare films that comes along every once in a while that is simply breathtaking, and it achieves this status not through big flashy special effects or massive Hollywood set pieces, but rather through its unique direction, superb writing, amazing acting, and genuine heart.Slumdog Millionaire is the story of a young man named Jamal who grew up in the slums of India. Jamal has found his way onto India's version of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"". The story starts, Jamal is only one question away from winning the jackpot, 20 million rupees, but the show ends shortly before he can get to the final question, so he must wait until the next episode to finish his run. After leaving the show, Jamal is kidnapped by the Indian police and is accused of cheating. Through his interrogation, Jamal describes in flashbacks just how he knew all of the various answers to the questions from different points in his life, as well we end up learning why he even went on the show in the first place.This film is quite easily Danny Boyle's best film of his career thus far. It has all of his usual trademarks that you expect from his directing, but it has something more that many of his previous films did not have, a true heart. That's right, Slumdog Millionaire is one of the most heartfelt films I have seen in years, and Danny Boyle's kinetic direction keeps the film rolling at a terrific pace, while never forsaking the true heart of the story.The film as well features terrific acting from all of its cast, especially Dev Patel who plays the oldest incarnation of Jamal. Also the film's script, written by Full Monty scribe Simon Beaufoy, is simply marvelous and is one of the best written scripts I have seen in a long time.To sum it all up, Slumdog Millionaire is easily one of the best films I have seen in a while. It is Oscar worthy in every single sense. If you see just one more film this year, make sure that it is Slumdog Millionaire, you will not regret it.I give Slumdog Millionaire a perfect 10 out of 10!",Slumdog Millionaire
149,WriterDave,Not Even Bizarrely Plausible,5,8 December 2008,"A young call center worker from Mumbai with a rough-and-tumble past named Jamal (a likable Dev Patel) becomes a contestant on the Indian version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" in the hopes that his true love (the beautiful Freida Pinto) will see him on TV and come back to him for good. Much of ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is done in flashbacks as the audience learns the personal story behind each of the questions. For some strange reason the filmmakers want us to think a person like Jamal wouldn't normally know the answers to these random trivia questions, but he does because of his unique life story, see? Well, it's a mildly interesting central conceit that quickly falls apart. At one point, a policeman questioning Jamal remarks that his story is ""bizarrely plausible."" I wish I could say I felt the same.It seems to be a trend this year for movies to contain wildly shifting tones. This is the type of film that thinks it's endearing and cute when a little Indian boy is given no choice but to dive into a pit of raw sewage to get a chance to meet a movie star, and then tries to be gritty and deadly serious when a man takes out an orphan's eyes with a spoon so the kid will make more money on the street as a blind urchin. Combining elements of ""Oliver Twist"", ""Romeo and Juliet"" and ""City of God"", Danny Boyle and his co-director Loveleen Tandan create a flimsy mosaic of convention and post-modern pastiche. With its sometimes fascinating look at Mumbai and its strange juxtaposition of modernity and immense wealth run amok with the biggest slums on earth, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is not without some intense and keenly interesting vignettes. However, the paper-thin script full of lazy characterizations and arbitrary moments leads to a painfully predictable denouement with a silly message about Destiny.Boyle is a director whose style has run out of steam. All of his trademarks are here: the shoddy editing; the shaky, grainy digital photography; the hyper-bright lighting that washes out most colors and makes whites and yellows blinding. Why is it I always feel like I'm getting an eye exam when I sit through his films? It left me with a headache that wasn't helped by the loud soundtrack. Any compelling moment, like the train ride that ends at the Taj Mahal or the early chase scene through the slums of Mumbai, I credit to Boyle's co-director Tandan.""Slumdog Millionaire"" is an energetic film I desperately wanted to like. Had it a sharper focus and harder edge that more thoroughly explored just one of the millions of enthralling stories that exist in cities like Mumbai, it could've been a rousing success. Instead, with its slapdash enthusiasm that feebly tries to thread some meaning into the barely plausible tale, I'm left thinking that Mumbai deserves a far better film.",Slumdog Millionaire
150,LoneWolfAndCub,One of the year's best!! Danny Boyle delivers another masterpiece of film,10,10 January 2009,"Slumdog Millionaire is a true cinematic achievement; a fast-paced, exhilarating and gritty drama with an amazing cast and interesting story. I will not be surprised if this is rewarded at all the upcoming award ceremonies. Danny Boyle has taken what is a seemingly basic story about a young man on India's version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" and transformed it into a realistic, powerful and, at times, gut-wrenching Dickensian picture. It is a journey through the slums of India, and what a journey it is, at times funny, at times incredibly sad and disturbing, but always captivating from start to finish. This is another masterpiece in the vein of Trainspotting - a stunningly original piece of film-making.This is one of those independent films that grabs audiences by surprise. This is not the summer blockbuster, this is more like Little Miss Sunshine, a piece of art that will not be seen by everyone, but will be treasured by those who see it. It is interesting to note that not all of the film is in English, but some Hindi, and the subtitles are placed rather uniquely, but suit the eccentric tone of the film. Do not let this prevent you from seeing it, in fact, it should encourage people to see it, as this should be viewed by everyone (especially younger audiences who take what they have for granted). Funnily enough Simon Beaufoy's script was originally entirely in English, but Boyle's decision to have the Indian kids speak in Hindi is the right. Having the children speaking in their native tongue makes perfect sense, especially because Boyle and Beaufoy depict the realism of the children's situation very well.Boyle and Beaufoy (bravely) do not shy away from showing the squalor of Bombay. These kids live in deplorable conditions amid the sewers and trash dumps of the slums. And, yet, thanks to Boyle's true ingenuity, he creates many humorous moments in the slums. Slumdog Millionaire is a dramatic comedy at heart; a film about friendship, gratitude, love, betrayal, poverty and hope. It will make you laugh, weep and cheer as you can't help but marvel at Boyle's talent as a director. Everything Boyle does, including the Bollywood touches, makes sense. There's so much kinetic energy in this film that it is impossible not to be enthralled by it.""Slumdog Millionaire"" is not to be missed. It is the best movie of the year. And it is one of the ten best films of the decade.5/5",Slumdog Millionaire
151,the-movie-guy,Slumdog Millionaire is the best 2008 sleeper film of the year,10,18 December 2008,"(Synopsis) ""Slumdog Millionaire"" tells the life story of two orphan brothers, Jamal (Dev Patel) and Salim (Madhur Mittal), who grew up in the slums of Mumbai and Bombay, India. Jamal works as a chai wallah (tea boy) at a call center where he calls in and gets a chance to be a contestant on India's ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"" The uneducated Jamal is put in the hot seat to answer each question. While playing the game Jamal remembers the answer by having a flashback of his life. The show's host cannot believe how a street ""slumdog"" like Jamal can correctly answer all the questions. As the show breaks for the day with only one question left, the host gets the police to interrogate Jamal to find out how he is cheating. After being tortured by the police, Jamal explains the sequence of events from his life in which he learns the answers. Jamal is released in time to answer the final $1,000,000 ($20,000,000 rupees) question.(My Comment) This is the 2008 sleeper film of the year that should win an Oscar for best film. The movie, describing the real India and the harsh life in India's slums, follows the life journey of three children, Jamal, Salim, and Latika (Freida Pinto), that is told through Jamal's eyes. These children lived in deplorable conditions growing up in abject poverty, crime, violence, also friendship, love, and hope. We get to see a slice-of-life that we really don't want to see; children living in squalor and adults taking advantage of them. However, all this will change if Jamal wins the TV game. If we played the Millionaire game, we would know the answers from what we learned in school, whereas, Jamal learned the answers from living a hard and eventful life. Jamal's flashbacks, revealing the details of Jamal's journey, are done in such a way that the film flows with ease. Stay through the closing credits and see the Bollywood dance number. This is one movie not to miss. (Celador Films, Run Time 2:00, Rated R) (10/10)",Slumdog Millionaire
152,LazySod,"Life, love and millionaires",8,9 February 2009,"When a young guy from the slums of Mumbai makes his way to the final question in the TV quiz ""Who wants to be a Millionaire"" there are people that are so doubtful of his sincerity that they have him arrested and interrogated - in their eyes there is no way he can know all the answers to the questions, so he has to be cheating. And as the film rolls on the question gets answered.The quiz is not the only red line running through the film - there are a few more things that keep re-appearing.

153,doctorsmoothlove,"Haven't been there, done that",6,7 February 2009,"The story behind Slumdog Millionaire is as enchanting as the film itself. Danny Boyle's and Loveleen Tandan's flick was originally going to be released straight to DVD. It has since been nominated for eleven BAFTAs and ten academy awards. If it wins Best Picture, it will become the most adored small production since The Last Emperor. There's a lot to love about this movie. You've seen the poor person who becomes wealthy plotting device before, but you probably haven't seen it like this. Slumdog Millionaire is a richly formulaic recreation of Hollywood's mid-twentieth century epics. Danny Boyle is an adventurous filmmaker. No genre or cultural difficulty escapes him. This must have been a difficult project to direct. Hindi is spoken in several scenes and numerous shots were captured in actual slums. The film, if nothing else, will provide Western audiences with an opportunity to experience a realistic portrayal of India. This idea is even used as a comedic device multiple times as the film progresses. I find it odd that the movie has received as much praise as it has. Some Indian film critics have argued that the movie is an opportunity for Westerners to see their own conventions in a new paint. The critic Gautaman Bhaskaran stated ""there is nothing Indian about this film"" in his review for Seoul Times. Bhaskaran has a point in his statement. Take this movie back to storyboard, insert any area of poverty and adjust the leads to create a new film on the same premise. I enjoyed Slumdog Millionaire for the same reason any other Westerner would like it. The film only stylistically invokes the viewer and only for certain audiences. After watching movies like The Wrestler, The Reader, and Milk I think Slumdog Millionaire is a pleasant diversion but a forgettable motion picture.Jamal Malik is interrogated by police officers following his astonishing success in the Indian version of Who Wants to be a Millionaire?. Everyone asks how a telephone operator with no formal education could know enough to advance to the final round. Jamal insists that he isn't well-read and was fortunate to have received the right questions. He reveals his life's story to the officers. Malik and his older brother Salim go through hell until they reach adulthood. Their mother is killed during a village raid and they meet a young girl named Latika. All three are whisked away to an orphanage where children are trained to be street performers. Salim and Jamal escape and become vagabonds, picking pockets when able. They encounter Latika again when Jamal insists they travel to Mumbai, where they meet their old orphanage leader. Salim dispatches him, uses his new street cred to join a gang, and claims Latika as his prize. He loses that prize to his boss who makes her his wife. Jamal is left alone, so he applies for Who Wants to be a Millionaire? in hopes that Latika will see him. The narrative switches to present time once the police accept Jamal's story. His success becomes a national phenomenon, and Salim sacrifices himself so Latika can finally be with Jamal.Jamal and the other central characters are played by three different people throughout the film. The child actors have the most screen time and deliver the most impressive performances. All of them cope with homelessness through dry wit. When Jamal and Salim meet Latika, the former is hesitant to allow her entry into their shelter because she is a girl. Jamal responds by suggesting that she could be the final musketeer, whose name they never learned. I found moments like that one, of which there are many, to be the best part of the film. When the young adults appear, humor ends and the tone is more serious. Dev Patel is seemingly expressionless as older Jamal. He looks worried, hustled, or whatever but his body doesn't respond, like a statue speaking for the first time. Freida Pinto does much better as older Latika, even though any other actress could have played her role. She hasn't acted in a movie before and delivers the quick, emotional punch from her earlier work as a model. I liked her performance because it filled in the gap created by Patel's rigidness. Boyle has made the same mistake he did in Sunshine. He doesn't pace the movie well. Sunshine begins as a noir science fiction film and becomes a slasher. Slumdog Millionaire changes from a loose childhood bonding movie to a romantic thriller as it ends. A Bollywood dance sequence follows to remind you of why you enjoyed the first two thirds. The discrepancy is less obvious in this movie, but it still bothered me. For purposes of plot, such alterations were necessary, unlike Sunshine. Forest Gump is a film very similar to this one and presents the same story favorably. Both movies feature characters in impossible events, but that is irrelevant. The main difference is Slumdog Millionaire is unable to create unique characters. Take Forest out of Forest Gump and the movie would be a failure.The world is experiencing a gigantic financial crisis now. What better way to separate oneself from it than watching a film about an impoverished person who legitimately earns his wealth? Add to that a love story, and the result is Slumdog Millionaire. Its resonance with filmgoers was guaranteed at any time of release but especially now. *** out of *****",Slumdog Millionaire

I don't think I'm quite willing to go that far for this simple rags to riches story. Its merits, excellent and brutal depiction of life in the slums of Mumbai, as well as an optimistic and exciting tone, are undeniable. I love Dev Patel, and his honesty and genuine nature shine through wonderfully here. Despite being told that he won at the very start, I was still on the edge of my seat and nervous for the entire climax. The way Boyle connects each question to the street smarts Jamal needed to survive the cutthroat streets of Mumbai was brilliant, and underscored the immense challenges faced growing up there. Where it falls short is in its overly simplistic plot and the incredible coincidences that were just impossible for me to ignore. Jamal manages to know just the right things and has exceptional luck in repeatedly finding Lakita. The romance plot was the most disappointing part for me, as he basically just had a connection to her from early childhood and remained obsessed with her ever since. I also didn't think the relationship and events relating to Salim, especially later in the movie, were cleanly shown. I love its early slice of life style and the connections between street smarts Jamal needed to survive and the show were truly wonderful, and the third act was still exciting. But when I look back on it and think about my relationship with the characters at the end, I'm left distant from the forced romance and the unbelievable run in the show.

Unique setting for a well worn subject, rags to riches, star crossed lovers, betrayal, destiny, etc. Pop culture inspired, music and TV shows which cross cultural boundaries. Novel narrative structure, and use of flashbacks. Its fun, and not every movie is. It's engrossing and over all enjoyable, it will please most, and I was smiling at the end.Its a good pop corn, movie fun, light, you could pop it in on a bad day, and be whisked off. I don't think its fair to say don't nitpick this cus its nice, it is, but its not perfect, and its being hailed as the best thing since sliced bread. Its a great romantic comedy though, and as an exercises in genre, it works well. The torture sequences really weren't as brutal or prolonged as they were being made out to be(not that any torture would be easy).The signature scene is the boy dipped in s&#t, to get his heroes autographs(its referenced at the end too), sometimes you have to suffer, wade through crap, to get what you really want. But the ""it is written"" ending was a cop out, a pleasant one, but it is what it is.

157,CinematicInceptions,Great movie provided that you buy into the story.,8,28 June 2016,"Something that should be clarified in regard to this story is the definition of destiny. The overall theme of the movie centers around destiny, but I think this is too easily confused with fate. When Jamal says that he and Latika are brought together by destiny, he means that she is his purpose in life. This does not mean they will necessarily be together, rather that they can only be together if Jamal pursues her ceaselessly and against all odds, as he does. At first, I thought the whole ""it is written"" thing meant that Jamal and Latika were brought together by supernatural forces, but when I reevaluated with the idea that destiny does not mean predestination, it gave me a greater respect for the story. If you don't believe in things like fate and destiny, then there's nothing I can say to convince you of this being a good story.It certainly has plenty of space for holes to be poked in it. It all depends on what you buy into. Danny Boyle and company did a good job of selling Jamal's knowledge of most of the answers through the events of his life, as well as his final reunion with Latika. But that doesn't mean that everyone will buy into the unlikely aspects of the story. Even if you don't, it can still be a pretty enjoyable experience. The story of Jamal's life is a pretty compelling one. It shows the joys and pains he has, his good and bad breaks, and especially his relationship with Salim.The contrast of Salim and Jamal comes from their definition of success. Salim sees success as breaking out of the slums by whatever means possible to gain financial security and a degree of power. Jamal on the other hand, follows his passions to find success. It's a bit sad to see them divided by this more and more as the movie progresses. This makes the ending with Latika choosing Jamal and leaving the life of relative luxury and security with Salim satisfying, but also bittersweet. The one thing I didn't understand about the ending was why Salim filled the bathtub with money. The only purpose this seemed to serve was to add to the theme of money being irrelevant since it happens at about the same time that Jamal wins 20 million rupees that he doesn't seem to want or have any plans for. Plus, this is consistent with how Boyle ended Trainspotting with the protagonist acquiring lots of money that they want for reasons that aren't really financial.The execution was amazing. The way that the editing, script pace, music, and cinematography flowed together was just so entertaining to watch, particularly during the montages. Even if you don't like the fairy tale style story, it's hard not to be impressed with the technical execution. The acting was above average, even from the various kid actors. In terms of the script, the dialogue isn't noteworthy, but the pacing is very good.This could rightly be called an adult version of a stereotypical kid's movie. It certainly bears enough resemblance to the rags to riches stories that riddle most fairy tales and such, all but blatantly putting a ""happily ever after"" at the end. I was actually surprised at how much I was okay with the happy ending, because I normally get annoyed by them. I would go into it with slightly low expectations. Most of the Oscars it won were well-deserved, being the technical ones for directing and editing. But it might be disappointing as a best picture winner. Overall Rating: 8.6/10",Slumdog Millionaire
158,ClaytonDavis,One of the best pictures in ages...,10,15 December 2008,"Truly deserving of all the praise its receiving, Slumdog Millionaire is the best film in years. Director Danny Boyle completely outdid himself with this touching tale Jamal Malik, a ""slumdog"" who makes it to the final question of the Indian version of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"" When he is suspected of cheating, he explains his extraordinary tale of how he knows each answer.Dev Patel in a terrific breakthrough role, gives a daring and emotional performance as Jamal. Freida Pinto stars as his love Latika, and as beautiful as she is, the role doesn't demand too much of her.Cinematography is the chief technical point of the film with crisp editing, a score to die for, and an amazing story that you couldn't believe it true unless you witnessed. This might be, (in my humble opinion) the best love story of the last 25 years and definitely the best picture of the year.****/****",Slumdog Millionaire

And as befits such an energised director, Boyle bounced up and down with sheer delight on collecting the hardware for Best Director. As he'd promised his kids, ""if this miracle ever happened, I would receive it in the spirit of Tigger"".Bouncing alongside him (at least metaphorically) was a relieved British film industry who'd possibly never imagined in their wildest dreams that this transparently un-commercial little number, with a budget of $15m, would ever make it out of the pit-stops of minority-interest cinema - even packing out final performances on Sunday evenings; unheard of! And which would, of course, be forgetting how escapist entertainment always cleans up during recessions (especially rags-to-riches fairy tales like these), and how a steady stream of Bollywood films and Bollywood-flavoured cinema over the past decade has proved popular in multicultural Britain, paving the way for Slumdog's success. If Boyle never makes another film, his elevated status in contemporary British film-making will remain as set as concrete.",Slumdog Millionaire

162,ethanbresnett,Totally blindsided by the power of this film!,9,4 February 2021,"I somewhat naively went into this film expecting a heart warming rags to riches tale, which in some ways Slumdog Millionaire is, but it is also so much more. It feels more like an epic, tracking the brutal upbringing of an Indian boy in uncompromising fashion.Really the quiz show elements are somewhat inconsequential for the most part. They are used as an ingenious creative device by Boyle to chart the seminal moments in our protagonists life, tying the present moments to the flashbacks brilliantly and seamlessly.Speaking of these moments, so much was crammed into this story. From devastating cruelty, to abject desperation, to unconditional love and redemption, Slumdog Millionaire has it all. The cast rose to the challenge of expressing the melting pot of emotions, with the young cast deserving extra special praise. This film will have you on the edge of your seat, laughing, and crying in equal measure.My only real criticism is that some of the film hasn't aged that well in terms of its cinematography and camera work. There were a few elements that just felt dated for me and detracted slightly from the overall tone and style of the film. Despite this, Slumdog Millionaire for the most part looked gorgeous. From the stunning vistas, to the cramped slums, to the heaving city streets, the majesty and frenetic energy of India was captured perfectly.This film is a real triumph of cinema, and thoroughly deserved its Oscar success.",Slumdog Millionaire
163,estreet-eva,"The ""Rocky"" of game shows.",8,5 December 2011,"""Slumdog"" precisely lived up to everything I heard about the film: the concept is gimmicky (the life story of an Indian untouchable is told through a series of game show questions) but the execution is brilliant. The first half of the two hour run-time is a tough sit as Jamal the protagonist faces the worst a brutal Indian society has to offer but in the meantime learns the answers which will eventually make him successful on the Indian version of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"" However, that emotional investment of watching slaughtered mothers and intentionally blinded children pays off in the second half as you become emotionally invested in Jamal continuing his dream run on the show and his continued pursuit of his oldest friend from the slums / love interest. The very end of the movie veers into Disney Bollywood style (stay for the dance number) territory but up until that point any ground gained by Jamal is paid for in torture and betrayal. In short, the film's emotional resonance is hard-won by the audience and is well-worth the effort. By the way, the central conceit for the ending of the movie came from the first winner of the American version of the game show who used his ""Phone-a-Friend"" lifeline to get in touch with his father not to ask for help but to let him know he was about to win a million dollars.",Slumdog Millionaire
164,SkullScreamerReturns,I don't get it...,5,19 June 2021,"This movie is famous for winning many oscars. I remember when it was new, everybody was talking about it. But only now I finally watched it.When I saw the name Danny Boyle I started to expect the worse. (I don't like ""28 Days Later"" at all, I think it's one of the worst directed films I've ever seen.) Well, the directing isn't quite that level bad in Slumdog Millionaire, and the story is better. Pretty much every aspect is better. But...I wouldn't still go as far as give oscars, let alone...8 of them! I really don't understand where did those awards came from. All I can see is an all around ""ok"" film which is not terrible but nothing special either. The story itself is somewhat interesting and unique so you want to keep watching how it unfolds, but I didn't find it super enjoyable as a film.I also struggled to find any kind of meaning from it - which I expected to be there because this is a favorite of critics who always seem to want everything to be so very deep. I only found two messages: 1) believe in impossible love the same way as in romantic comedies with Julia Roberts, 2) believe in money because it's cool to be a millionare. It almost feels like a 2-hour commercial for ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"" show. Well, I think that kind of mood and style (and especially the ending) comes from bollywood movies which this film pays tribute to (at least little bit). But where the oscars come from I still don't know.I don't mean to be excessively rude ( just a little bit edgy). Am I missing something? Because I think it's just an average film. Possible to watch once but I'd be really bored if having to watch it again. Maybe it's good but just not my cup of tea.

You'd think there was something more to it than its novel setting, the slums of Mumbai. But if there is something noteworthy about it, it's not the ideas expressed in it, but rather the direction which is pretty impressive. I'm still not sure how Boyle pulled it off. The whole first half-hour or so I was really distracted trying to figure out just what had been done to capture the action in the way it was. It was as if it was captured as it happens where a lot of what you see has already started by the time you focus on it. It's very effective and in no way reminiscent of a documentary but rather real life experience. Aside from that, however, the story is fairly lame. It's well acted and filmed, and I wouldn't call it a waste of time in any way, but it left me with little more knowledge than I had had before I'd seen it. Possibly for people who haven't experienced third world slums, it might be enlightening, but I've been there and it didn't shine a bright light into any dark corners for me.",Slumdog Millionaire

Worse than that all the Oscars it won, the only one I can understand was best original song. I like Danny Boyle & am sure he has a great career ahead of him. He's already done some really enjoyable films including ""Millions"" which is twice as good as this. I don't know how this won so many awards or what film they saw because this can't be it. It's full of clichés, the story is completely transparent with absolutely no surprises, & the script is middle of the road...at best! It will also help that you really like the show ""Who wants to be a Millionaire"" because it's a large part of the story. If you don't like I don't, well it's even harder to get in on the story. On a plus note the acting was good especially the male lead Dev Patel & both of the little boys playing the young versions of Salim & Jamal are great. I can't figure out why this is any better than the other films nominated for Oscars, but this did not deserve Best Picture at all. I'm betting in 5-10 years this will be one of those films that people will wonder how this won all these awards. I'll wait for you all to catch up, but in all honesty stop doing/rating what everybody else is doing because it's the ""IN THING"" & ignore the fact it won all the awards it won & rate the film on it's own. No bias no awards just how the film rates as it's own separate entity. It really is mediocre, not bad, but it's not good either but it definitely is not worthy of #42 of all time as it is ranked right now on IMDb. That puts it above ""Chinatown, The Departed & Forrest Gump?"" (Just to name a few) What planet are you all from?

At times brutal and at others smirky smart, the characters play their parts without the need to fully explain everything.

Despite one clinker (28 Days), he has managed to earn my respect as a talented director. 'Slumdog Millionaire' is just another hands down winner for Boyle. The film concerns a homeless ""Chai Wallah"" (tea dispenser)who manages to get himself on India's equivalent to 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire'. The film works within the frame work that it's believed that he is cheating, and is carted off to the local police department for a confession (under some brutal torture). Within the use of flashbacks, we find out about just how he got to where he is. The film's cast includes actors known from Bollywood musicals,including some others recruited from their work in Indian television. The romance angle also works,as well. This is a film that manages to evoke a myriad of emotions for the central character. It has a certain Charles Dickens feel to it,as well as a rough & tumble inner city drama (think in terms of 'City Of God'). Rated 'R' by the MPAA, this film serves up some brutal violence & rough language,as well as some unpleasant child abuse. Okay for older teens,but you may want to leave the younger children out of it.",Slumdog Millionaire
172,tastyhotdogs,Brilliant,8,24 January 2009,"Took wifey last night to ""La Premiere"" (the Hoyts version of Gold Class) to see ""Slumdog Millionaire"". It's pretty similar to ""Gold Class"" except you get complimentary soft drink and popcorn, which is a pretty sweet deal, but you don't get a reclining chair (which sucks) and you sit with others along a balcony which is overseeing where the poor people sit. One of the highlights of the night was watching the poor people work out how they got upto our seats. I wanted to shout something insulting to them, but I'm pretty humble.The movie was excellent. It's about a boy named Jamal who gets to the last question of India's version of ""Who wants to be a millionaire"". The movie starts with him being interrogated the day before he gets to the last question as the host of the show is suspicious he's cheating, especially because of the fact he's a ""slumdog"". We then retrace Jamal watching the video of the show with the police and him telling stories about how he knew the answers.It's a brilliant idea for a movie (based upon the book ""Q&A"") and played out well as the story was so good. The cast is really solid, especially when it follows Jamal, his brother Salim and friend Latika as little children. The cast is really good, the cinematography excellent and the story is a masterpiece. Don't just take my word for it though- it won the Golden Globe for best picture and is No. 34 on the IMDb.com Top 250, 3 spots ahead of ""Wall-E"".2 amusing side notes.1/ About half way through mum rang me (she was babysitting) asking how to get the sound back on as Isaac had fiddled with the TV set-up.

One caller phoned in and told him it wasn't and that he thought it was based on a book but Andy countered that the book must have been based on a true story.

175,markgorman,Flawed but great in parts,7,25 January 2009,"Well, the critics are getting awfully excited about this film, so I'd like to join the debate with a strong note of caution.This is a pretty good movie but I think the imperfection that lies at its heart is what stops it being a great movie. namely, the acting. Of it's 10 Oscar nominations not a single one is for the performances of its leading players and that is, in my view, totally appropriate.This movie is too much of a pick n mix affair to truly satisfy. The central cinematic device at its core, telling a life story (in three sub-generations; infant, child and teen means that its too stop-start to really fully engage.) What you find is that the two younger sections of the film are both more believable and more engaging than the latter stage which starts to unravel in credibility the more it develops.The performances of the two younger Jamals are light of touch, frequently hilarious - particularly in the movie's highlight where the youngest Jamal exits the latrines in true Trainspotting style - and quite moving. Poor old, rather wooden and not especially engaging, Dev Patel has to deal with a plot that is becoming more ridiculous by the moment as his pursuit of the beautiful Latika verges, at times, on the preposterous. How Salim can continually cross paths with the object of his affection so often in a city with a population twice that of the whole of the UK was beyond me.OK, that's all the bad stuff out of the way, now let's turn to the positives. The cinematography (an Oscar nod for Anthony Dod Mantle) and sound design in this movie combine to stunning effect at times. It's like a Discover documentary at its best and you simply cannot get enough of Mumbai, which is given added oomph by the music of A.R. Rahman who picks up no less than three Oscar nominations. Nice use of MIA's music in places too.It's actually all the technical disciplines that this movie excels in and has been recognised for (sound, sound editing, music, cinematography and editing). so that neatly brings us to its direction.Danny Boyle.What to make of him? Well, a director's job is to realise all aspects of a production from performance to technical. I think the script blew his chances of the former but he has excelled at the latter and to many it is seen as the highlight of his career. I beg to differ. His track record is patchy to say the least. Trainspotting is by far the most overrated film of its generation (not a patch on his brilliant Shallow Grave), The Beach and A Life Less Ordinary are best glossed over. But 28 Days Later is as good a horror movie as has been made since The Shining, and Sunshine is as good as it gets in Sci fi. Both are, in my humble opinion at least, better movies than Slumdog.But you lot don't seem to agree. A quick look at Boyle's IMDb ratings shows that the public consider Slumdog his masterpiece with a rating of 8.7 (astonishingly, that places it 34th in IMDb's all time list). How is this possible in a seemingly foolproof ratings mechanism? Early enthusiasm? Maybe as the ratings mature he will come back to the field. I'd think that will indeed be the case as old moaners like me get our way.Here are all his cinematic releases and how IMDb rate them; and my own views. Please feel free to scoff or agree as you see fit.Slumdog IMDb 8.7 Me 7 Sunshine IMDb 7.3 Me 9 28 Days later IMDb 7.5 Me 9 Shallow Grave IMDb 7.4 Me 9 Trainspotting IMDb 8.2 Me 5 (this is ranked 182 of all time on IMDb - Holy cow!) The Beach IMDb 6.2 Me 5 For the record, A life Less ordinary picks up 6.4 and Millions gets a 7.2 on IMDb. I haven't seen either, but the bit of ALLO that I saw looked poor.I like Slumdog a lot I have to say, but its imperfections were too significant to overlook. Much as I hoped it would indeed be the feelgood movie of all time (or whatever the marketing blurb claims) it wasn't, but it was a great visual and aural spectacle that merits a trip to your local cinema. 7 out of 10.",Slumdog Millionaire

180,dvc5159,"This decade's ""Rocky""; undeniably appealing and masterfully done.",6,24 February 2009,"First off, I want to rant (sorry) - for the year 2008, there were three films I gave a 10/10 rating, this film, ""WALL-E"", and ""The Dark Knight"". The latter was snubbed of its Academy Awards Nominations for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay, all because that the Academy does not deem superhero summer blockbusters as art. I was mad as personally I think TDK is the film of the decade, and had it been nominated for the three, I'd think it win them.Thankfully, this film and WALL-E, two romantic films, do the Oscars justice. WALL-E is a marvel. However, I'd give my hats off to Slumdog for giving me the biggest movie surprise of the year. The movie is energetic, has a kinetic pace, a touching story, and a main character that we all root for. Director Danny Boyle takes a story and crafts it into one of the most startlingly original films of the decade, and it stands tall over most films.We have Jamal, a Mumbai ""slumdog"" who participates in a ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"" TV game show in hopes that the love of his life will see him. He apparently knows all the answers to the questions and shows no sign of losing. This prompts investigators to interrogate him, and, clues to how he knows the answers are represented in flashbacks of his life leading him up to where he is.The movie cannot be praised without the fine, innocent and heart-stealing characters that the young actors portray. They embody the innocence, curiosity, and enthusiasm of youth. Without them, the film would be nothing. They can all stand up and take a bow, for their performances mold the film to near-perfection.The film's story, while uplifting and inspiring at times, is gut-wrenching, gritty, powerful, and, filled with realism. How the screenwriter makes the story believable is truly remarkable, as it takes talent and dedication to do it, and it shows on the silver screen. Having the kids speak Hindi for 1/3 of the film adds more realism to the film, as the young starlets are more comfortable speaking in their native tongue, as well as showing real life in the slums the way a Hindi kid would see it. There is not one scene where you do not cheer for the main character, Jamal. And the ending is truly marvelous, an ending that will be remembered for a long time.The direction is superb. Fast paced, giving little time to breathe. Obvious Danny Boyle. But, he livens up the atmosphere of the movie, which is dark and gritty. This is Boyle's best film yet, he is truly a filmmaker for his time, and this film certainly proves it. Hell, even in the poor slums there are moments that we can laugh and reflect at! Now that's something that Boyle can be proud of, making the audience feel and care for the characters, to which he succeeds enormously. There is a scene involving an open toilet and Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan, for which I will not tell, that has become one of the most memorable movie scenes for the decade. Academy Award Winner Danny Boyle, you deserve it.Technically speaking, the music by Bollywood regular A. R. Rahman is perfect for the film. It is uplifting, gritty, beautiful, thrilling and atmospheric at the same time. He deserves the Oscar win. The cinematography shows the ugly slums of Mumbai in full glory, capturing the essence of the film while making it beautiful at the same time. The editing is nicely done making it fast paced.""Slumdog Millionaire"" is an uplifting, near-flawless masterpiece. It drips with movie magic and reminds us why we fell in love with the movies in the first place. To be honest I wanted ""The Dark Knight"" to win, but since it was not nominated, Slumdog was my clear favorite to win the coveted Best Picture award. And hey, it did! Congrats to everyone on the film. Bravo! And finally, Bollywood has something to be proud of, and Hollywood should partner up with them again sometime soon.Overall rating: 9/10",Slumdog Millionaire
181,Sanpaco13,Absolutely loved it. That is my final answer.,10,6 April 2009,"I'm writing this review before I read all of the ""I hated it so apparently I'm unique because I hate anything that's popular"" threads, because every time I read those first I end up defending the movie and feel like I'm writing a personal message to those people instead of just saying why I did or did not like the movie. So here goes.I loved Slumdog Millionaire. I am still somewhat baffled over the R rating. First of all as far as language goes I don't remember one single use of the F word although apparently it was used like twice. Which still shouldn't make it rated R because I've seen quite a few PG-13 movies that have used the F word twice or more. I do remember a couple of times hearing the S word. But hey its a movie. Lots of movies have the S word. Nudity/Sex: well you see a little kids bum and there's a scene where it is implied that a young girl is coerced into sleeping with a young boy. OK well, I see that on the news every time a kiddie porn ring is busted. They didn't show anything. They just imply that it happened. Blood/Violence: there is some violence and some pretty intense scenes but there is literally no blood or gore. You see people get shot and hit in the head with a crowbar and have acid poured into their eyes but you don't actually see any of the gore. Intense yes. Take a child to see it no. But I do remember watching an episode or 60 of 24 where Jack Bauer more than implies that he killed some dude by biting his jugular vein. I mean come on. Point = TV shows are more intense than this. Drugs/Alcohol etc. again TV is worse or equal to what was seen in this movie. I mean couldn't they have just put a Parental Discretion is advised instead of slapping an R rating on there just because it was made by Danny Boyle? Wow. OK rating rant over. The movie is a very charming story about two young brothers living in the slums of India who lose their mother and are forced to fend for themselves. It is also a love story about one of the brother's quest to reunite with a girl they meet who also has no parents. The way the story is told is interesting. We get to see the main character Jamal on the Indian version of the show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire answering all kinds of questions and at the same time he explaining how he knew the answers to the questions to a police chief who is trying to get him to confess to cheating. Each question leads to a flashback which is where the main story comes in. It is a very creative story and I thought very well crafted. While the actual elements are quite text book, (hero starts at home, goes on a quest, has adventures and whatnot, rescues the princess from the evil dragon, etc. whatever) but since when is that kind of a story not welcome? I like stories with happy endings. I don't think there is any hidden political agenda in the movie. I don't think Danny Boyle is naive or pompous or trying to talk down to anyone. I think he just wanted to tell an interesting engaging story about three very likable characters who are trying to deal with life, but in a very different setting than a lot of people are used to. Its kind of like Oliver Twist meets Homer's Odyssey meets -insert love story here- in India. I knew what the 20 million rupee question was going to be from the second he gets whacked over the head with the book in the beginning by the way, but the predictability of the movie doesn't take away from its enjoyment because it doesn't try to present itself as a movie that trying to keep you guessing or surprise you with intricate plot twists.Great there I go. I haven't even read the hater's posts yet and I'm still defending the show based on what I'm sure they are all saying. Well whatever. I give the movie a 10. It deserved Best Picture of 2008.",Slumdog Millionaire
182,gary-444,"A Colourful, Visceral Triumph",9,18 January 2009,"Very occasionally a film comes along which has the potential to change the face of Commercial Cinema, Slumdog Millionaire is one of them. Hollywood represents the bulk of cinematic history and is still the driving force behind it. But we live in a changing world. Politically we are seeing a resurgent Russia, and the emergence of China and India as economic super powers. Cinema is only now starting to pick up those shifts.The American Film Industry, like its Motor Car Industry, has grown fat and lazy. Tired plots, formulaic scripts, predictable locations and a wearisome reliance on big budgets, CGI and big explosions to ""deliver"" have made it increasingly less interesting, and relevant, to World audiences, and I suspect to home ones too.So here we have a film shot totally in India, mainly in Mumbai, with no Western actors, no ""names"", and a substantial amount of dialogue in Hindi, sub titled into English. (You can almost hear the LA Exec writing the reject slip for the pitch, can't you?). At first glance English Director, Danny Boyle, is not the obvious choice. But on closer inspection you consider the visual big budget feasts which were ""Sunshine"" and ""The Beach"", the pacey drama of ""A Life Less Ordinary"", the visceral grittiness of ""28 Days Later"" and ""Trainspotting"", and the low budget/ gallows humour of ""Shallow Grave"" and you have the ingredients which make ""Slumdog's "" success.Cinematically it is a joy, rich colours, beautifully shot, blaze across the screen. The locations enthral. OK the Taj Mahal is predictable, but nonetheless breathtaking, the slums a vibrant cesspit. The acting is convincing and compelling, wonderfully led by Dev Patel as Jamal Malik the eponymous hero. Heaving with brilliant cameos, watch out for the Police Inspector, his fat side kick, and the evil Orphanage ""Fagin"".It is true that Hollywood cliché may have been swapped for Bollywood cliché . But as a ""cross-over trailblazer for a largely unsuspecting audience, that is forgivable ,it works. Beware that although the story does have the advertised feel-good ending, the content has the trademark Danny Boyle rawness which is frequently uncomfortable, and in one case unwatchable. But that rawness also delivers the funniest, "" shittyest"" scene of the picture!A classic ""rages to riches"" premise, told with style and innovation, a landmark film.",Slumdog Millionaire
183,barrys82,The movie of the year,10,2 March 2009,"Slumdog Millionaire tells the story f how impoverished Indian teen Jamal Malik became a contestant on the Hindi version of ""Who Wants to be A Millionaire?"" -- an endeavor made without prize money in mind, rather, an effort to prove his love for his friend Latika, who is an ardent fan of the show. A movie so raw and real, it shows us the difficult life of children in India and teaches us that no matter what you always must have faith on what you want in life and fight for it. The cast formed by new actors, delivers flawless performances full of intensity and dram, so natural and convincing. Directed by Danny Boyle, with this film , he manages a very heart warming story full of emotions. The movie may start a little slow but its never tiresome to the viewer. In conclusion, Slumdog Millionaire is an emotional movie that will touch your heart and at the end will leave you with a smile on your face.",Slumdog Millionaire
184,disinterested_spectator,A Simple-Minded Fantasy,3,14 December 2016,"If ""Slumdog Millionaire"" were generally disliked, I would never bother to write a review about such a ridiculous movie. But as it was praised by critics, won many awards, including the Academy Awards Best Picture, and was incredibly successful at the box office, I find myself stunned. Sure, I could dismiss the whole thing as being a matter of taste, about which there can be no dispute, but that still leaves me wondering, ""Why is my taste so different from everyone else?""Let us sort out a few of the elements. First, I do not know what India is really like in general, but that which is presented to us in this movie is horrible. The great pessimist Schopenhauer, reflecting on the pain and suffering of existence, declared that the world ought not to exist, that the moon is a better place than the Earth, because there is no life on the moon. Overall, my life has been pretty good, living in middle-class America and being in good health, but if there were such a thing as reincarnation, and if I were given a chance to come back in a new life, I think I would pass, preferring oblivion instead. In the movies, people always come back in good health as white, middle-class Americans, but I would be afraid that I would end up in some country like Syria, suffering the ravages of war, or some famine-stricken or plague-ridden country in Africa, or end up as an untouchable in Calcutta, scrounging around for my breakfast in a garbage dump. In other words, if the India in this movie were typical of existence on this planet in general, then I would never want to be reborn. This is especially so when one considers that most of the suffering in this movie is not the result of war, famine, or plague, but of cruelty. Instead, I would have to agree with Schopenhauer that it would have been better had we never been born in the first place. Nevertheless, the tone of this movie is, beyond all reason, life-affirming.Second, the movie centers around a quiz show, the equivalent of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" I have never cared for quiz shows. I have never bought a lottery ticket. And, in general, I have never dreamed of getting rich in one big, lucky stroke. I suspect that the people who love to gamble and watch game shows are probably the same people that loved this movie. In other words, Slumdog Millionaire plays into the fantasy shared by so many that no matter how bad things may be, there is always the hope, taken very seriously by such people, that one day they may hit it big. Never having indulged in such a fantasy, however, this movie was simply not believable to me, not even qua fantasy.With quiz shows like ""Jeopardy!"" the successful contestants are those with prodigious memories for facts, figures, names, dates, and places. But the quiz show Jamal participates in is multiple choice, which means that, as Jamal himself notes at one point, you don't have to be a genius to answer those questions. In fact, pure luck might get you by. Most of the time he is able to answer the question correctly because some horrible thing was going on in his life at the moment he happened upon the information that allows him to answer the question, such as his seeing a statue of a god just after his mother got her brains bashed in. But if he is asked a question for which there was no corresponding traumatic event in his life, he is in trouble. So, when he is asked about India's emblematic motto, whether it says that it is truth, lies, fashion, or money that triumphs, he has not the slightest idea what the answer to that question could possibly be. The policeman who is torturing him into confessing that he is cheating says that his five-year-old daughter could answer that question. Quite right, because nothing more than common sense is needed. In fact, Jamal does seem to be something of a mouth breather.But this plays right into the above-mentioned fantasy. Most of us know we could never win at ""Jeapardy!"" but since we could do even better than Jamal at that point, we can easily imagine winning such a game show, especially if we are lucky enough to be asked questions about trivia that happens to come to our attention when something awful happens to us like jumping into a cesspool of human dung.The final question is the name of the third musketeer in the novel by Dumas. We all know the answer to that question, especially when prompted by the multiple-choice format, so now we can really fantasize about how we might win such a contest. He does not know the answer, but that's all right, because he just guesses that it is Aramis. Why is he so lucky at this point? Because Latika was Jamal's and his brother's ""third musketeer."" How could he lose?On the night he wins the twenty million rupees, Latika is freed from the gangster who has been beating her and raping her for years, so now Jamal and Latika can live happily ever after on his millions. Schopenhauer once said, ""Lovers are traitors to their species. For the sake of a mere passion, they perpetuate the want and misery that would otherwise so speedily come to an end."" And so, as the musical finale takes place, as uplifting as the ending of ""The Music Man"" or ""Grease,"" my only thought was that they are going to get married and start having babies, oblivious to nightmare world that has characterized their lives up to that point.The only way this movie makes any sense to me is if the whole thing is Jamal's hallucination while being tortured in a police station for stealing a bicycle.",Slumdog Millionaire
185,come2whereimfrom,What a terrible film.,3,29 December 2008,"Firstly if you don't like 'Who wants to be a millionaire?' then steer clear of this film as it's like watching a feature length interrupted episode minus Chris Tarrant. Secondly, if like me you have a cold dead robot heart, avoid this at all costs, you have been warned. Danny Boyle's 'feel-good film of the decade' (News of the world) is so packed full of clichés it feels like its trying to reach a million itself. The rags to riches story will melt even the hardest of hearts, the 'oh look he used to be covered in sh*t and now he is a millionaire' stick starts wearing thin pretty early on and doesn't get much better as Boyle tries to inject some pace by including chase sequences to a thumping soundtrack that consists mostly of M.I.A. tracks. The film is long and boring with each flashback explaining how this dumb kid could possibly know the answer to a certain question, honestly he didn't cheat he knows because (cue some horrific part of his upbringing which he just happens to now be being asked a question about) of his experiences. But honestly it is so cool when the whole nation gets behind him and the suspense comes thick and fast as when filming the show they have to take an advert break, I was on the edge of my seat (desperate to leave the cinema). The idea is weak to begin with but stretching it out to two hours is excruciating, but he's only got one lifeline left, I tell you I still had long nails by the end, yep definitely no biting there. All in all a waste of time movie that offers nothing new or indeed anything old revamped. In fact the only reason I can see that this film got made was to once again rinse the pockets of the idiots who made 'Mamma Mia' the biggest British film of 2008. Yeah that's right she can't afford to heat her house but she can afford to go see this rubbish, your granny will love it whereas I hated it.",Slumdog Millionaire
186,Eternality,A masterpiece of sight and sound.,9,3 November 2010,"Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire is a masterpiece of sight and sound. Nominated for ten Oscars including Best Picture and Director, Boyle's film is an unexpected frontrunner in the Oscar race whose stiffest competitor is David Fincher's The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, which is nominated for thirteen Oscars. British director Boyle made his filmmaking debut with Shallow Grave (1995). But it is the critically-lauded drug drama Trainspotting (1996) that made him a sensation. While his films can range from the dreadful such as The Beach (2000) to the inspiring such as Millions (2004), there is a commonality that runs through many of his movies - they are energetic and vibrant.There is probably no other film in Boyle's body of work that exemplifies the essence of his craft than Slumdog Millionaire, a motion picture that encapsulates the wondrous power and beauty of cinema. Slumdog Millionaire is shot on location in the slums of Mumbai, India. After a harrowing introduction that establishes the understanding that this is going to be a unique 'flashback' film, viewers are treated to a phenomenal opening sequence that is captivatingly-photographed and frenetically-edited to a pulsating, hypnotic Oscar-nominated soundtrack by A. R Rahman whom remarkably is also nominated for a further two Oscars for Best Original Song: ""O Saya"" and ""Jai Ho"". This sequence is an eye-opener; the gritty and frantic filmmaking allows Boyle to bring out the vibrancy and color of Mumbai slums with startling immediacy (including a nice touch to the presentation of the subtitles).Slumdog Millionaire has romance at its core. This is more obvious towards the second third of the film when Jamal (Dev Patel) and Latika (Freida Pinto) become teenagers and begin to feel the flitters of love. Jamal hopes to prove his love to Latika by joining India's version of the popular game-show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire. He makes his way to the top albeit accusations of cheating. Well, how can a slumdog know everything? He is arrested and interrogated, but explains that he knew the answers already. The film then pours everything it has to the viewers in numerous perfectly-staged flashbacks that reveal in detail how Jamal's turbulent life in the slums is linked with the questions answered during the game-show.Boyle does a brilliant job guiding untrained slum kids to act in front of a moving lens. Furthermore, he does not shy away from capturing true images of unsightly Mumbai and to use it as a beautiful backdrop for his film. The acting is not of the highest order, but it is easy to forgive because most of the cast are either non-professionals or greenhorns in their field. As an ensemble, the cast deliver. But individually, the characters only merely connect to the audience and feel slightly distant. Thus, Slumdog Millionaire lacks in raw emotional power of some of this year's best films including The Wrestler and Doubt. Boyle wraps the film up neatly and throws in a high-impact Bollywood dance sequence cum end credits that is not to be missed. It has been quite a while since I left the theater with such high spirits. Recommended! SCORE: 8.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",Slumdog Millionaire
187,dy158,Feel-good as you can get,8,4 July 2011,"What do you get when you have an underdog story, the essence of India, a gameshow which has gripped a country? It would come to be British film director Danny Boyle's Oscar-winning film of 2009 of Slumdog Millionaire, based on Indian novelist Vikas Swarup's Q&A.It tells the story of 18-year-old Jamal (Dev Patel), the former street child now working as a tea server at a call centre being on the Indian version of 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?'. Just as he was one question away from the big prize where his incredible run has captured the nation's imagination, he was being suspected of cheating. On the basis of how a 'slumdog' knows the answers on the gameshow.As the gameshow progresses, we are being treated to flashbacks of Jamal's life which corresponds to where every step of the way on the gameshow, where each round provided a clue as to how he knows the answers which he constantly stuns the jealous host Prem Kumar (Anil Kapoor) who had even tried to frame him in the penultimate round. Along the way, the flashbacks also included his brother Salim and the person he has considered to be the 'third musketeer' Latika who comes from the same slum as him and his brother, based on the famed Alexandre Dumas novel of 'The Three Musketeers'. And the various adventures the trio had after they escaped from gangster Maman (Ankur Vikal).One of the reasons why this is a feel-good film for me because one cannot help but along the way, rooting for Jamal to succeed. Only cynics does not like an underdog story, where the main character overcomes all odds to come up tops at the end of the day. Not only that, Patel's character who comes from the slums before he would be a tea server at a call centre shows not only the unglamorous sight of India via the slums, and what the world knows about India through what happened in the final scene in terms of what Bollywood has presented to the world. And the final reason is partly biased on my part because the fact that it also uses the element of the gameshow 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire' brought me back to the days when I was a big fan of the gameshow when it was still very popular a decade or so ago.A recommended film for some feel-good factor, especially if one needs a pick-me-up.",Slumdog Millionaire
188,nicolechan916,A creatively made film with outstanding performances.,10,16 June 2014,"The three main characters include Jamal, his older brother Salim (Madhur Mittal) and Latika (Freida Pinto). There were three actors behind each character; for when they were about 8 years, 15 years and then all grown up (I'm guessing the ages). And all of them, I must say, gave incredible performances.I've been wanting to watch this film for awhile and I think I actually did watch a bit once, but didn't finish it for some reason. Also, I was unaware that this was based on a book, Q & A by Vykas Swarup.Anyway, the director of this film juxtaposes scenes of the past and present stunningly. The audience is fed the information one by one and so it is more of showing us what happened rather than telling us along the way. This made it incredibly relevant for the audience as they knew what the characters had been through.This film also did not shy away from telling us how things really were in India. I've never been to India myself but making 20% of the film in Hindi really adds to the authenticity. The scenes in the landfills as well clearly showed the high rate of poverty and orphans in the city.Read the full review at championangels.wordpress.com",Slumdog Millionaire
189,greene515,who want's to be a millionaire?,10,22 February 2009,"Slumdog Millionaire (2008) Directed by Danny Boyle is certainly one of his best film's to date, our story begins in the poorest slums of Mumbai Jamal as an orphan, running around with his brother Salim on the streets, scavenging through the rubbish dumps to survive and getting into trouble with the gangs who operate in the city. The chances of a rags-to-Raja story are slim for anyone growing up in an environment where traditionally the only way out is in a box or into a prison cell. That could be the fate of his brother who has adapted to the hard way of living by throwing in his lot with the city's top gangster, but Jamal, working as a lowly tea-boy in a call center, has been given a golden opportunity to escape through an appearance on a popular national television quiz-show. He's only doing it for one reason however - he's hoping it will buy him the freedom of his childhood love, Latika, the third musketeer in their little group of adventurers. it's a great story which is all the more compelling as the unclean and very dangerous environment offer's lot's of various escapades with our young protagonist's Slumdog Millionaire is undoubtedly on of the best film's i've seen so far this year, it look's tipped to take the Oscar's by storm and deservedly so.",Slumdog Millionaire

The fact that partially it is based on something that was a reality makes the feeling even better and shocking. It shows us poverty, it shows us love, determination, greed, hierarchy, dominance, pain, betrayal, family and many other things that define life, and all of that just trough a TV show.

191,anhedonia,A stunning achievement: The best film of the year and one of the most exhilarating film-going experiences,10,3 November 2008,"I won't see a better, more exhilarating movie this year than Danny Boyle's ""Slumdog Millionaire."" If Academy voters have any sense, they will nominate this for Best Picture and Best Director and then vote overwhelmingly for it for both awards.Boyle has taken what is essentially a story about a young man on India's version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" and transformed it into a gritty, realistic, powerful and, at times, gut-wrenching fairy tale. It's a Dickensian picture about a world rarely, if ever, seen in mainstream movies, a film that grabs us from the opening frame and doesn't let go until the credits roll at the end.This is why I love movies. Films like ""Slumdog Millionaire"" are rare. They are things of beauty, works of art that make me fall in love with movies all over again. Boyle has done it twice. First with ""Millions"" (2004), which also, coincidentally, was about a young boy and money; and now with ""Slumdog Millionaire."" This is Boyle's masterpiece - a stunningly original piece of film-making.Every once in a while there is a sleeper film, usually an independent movie, that comes along, takes everyone by surprise, then gets terrific word of mouth and becomes a huge success. ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" (2002), ""Little Miss Sunshine"" (2006) - though I did not care much for it - and ""Juno"" (2007) are such films. But, frankly, those films can't hold a candle to ""Slumdog Millionaire.""What might surprise many viewers is that a third of the dialogue is in Hindi. (And Boyle's placement of subtitles on the screen makes such good sense!) Please do not let that dissuade you from seeing this marvelous film. Do not let the R rating prevent you, either. What was the MPAA thinking? Honestly! There are far more offensive, vulgar and violent movies that are rated PG-13. ""Slumdog Millionaire"" should never have received an R rating. (This film should be mandatory viewing for young people, especially those in industrialized nations.) Simon Beaufoy's script was originally entirely in English, but Boyle's decision to have the Indian kids speak in Hindi, instead, is the right call. Having the children speaking in their native tongue makes perfect sense, especially because Boyle and Beaufoy depicts the realism of the kids' lives.That's what incredible about this film. Boyle and Beaufoy do not shy away from showing the squalor of Bombay. These kids live in deplorable conditions amid the grime, sewers and trash dumps of the slums. And, yet, thanks of Boyle true ingenuity, he creates uplifting and even humorous moments in the slums. There is one moment - and I shan't spoil it for anyone, but you will know it when you see it - that very well might be my favorite film moment in the last five years.Boyle doesn't do a thing wrong here. From his choice of actors to the music to his choice of colors, Boyle works his magic.The performances are uniformly good. Irrfan Khan finds the right balance between a tormentor and a quasi-father figure as the police officer. There's young Dev Patel as Jamal, playing with confidence, bringing a wonderful swagger to his role, as well as a sense of fear that we completely understand. Freida Pinto as the love interest is superb. And, of course, there are the three young 'uns. Perfectly cast, they actually make the film work. Their performances as Jamal, Salim and Latika are so utterly convincing that they completely draw us into the picture and make the jobs of the older actors playing them much easier.""Slumdog Millionaire"" is, I suppose, a dramatic comedy at heart. But it is also much more. It is a film about friendship, gratitude, love, betrayal, poverty and hope. It makes you laugh, weep and cheer as you can't help but marvel at Boyle's sheer genius.The film moves along at a breakneck pace, yet none of the cinematic flair - and there is plenty - seems superfluous. Everything Boyle does, including the Bollywood touches, makes sense. There's such a brilliantly kinetic energy to this film that it is impossible not to be enthralled by it.What Boyle has done is truly miraculous. He has turned a film about street life in Bombay into a visceral, genuine crowd-pleaser. And you will walk out of the movie theater feeling inspired and hopeful, knowing you've just seen something very special.""Slumdog Millionaire"" is not to be missed. It is the best movie of the year. And it is, without any doubt, one of the ten best films of the decade.",Slumdog Millionaire
192,higherall7,Chances to Dream,10,7 September 2020,"This is a fascinating film on many levels. I'm glad I read several of the reviews before I began my own. There is very little I have to add to all the raving and the hoopla. The technical merits of this piece I believe have been adequately explored by others, leaving me little room to appear as the know-it-all as is my wont. There are, however, a few observations I would like to offer into the mix.First of all, there is something I remember Miss Barat mentioning in Art History Class while I was attending the College for Creative Studies. She stated casually that when people are enduring depressing or troubling times, you often find the Art unexpectedly optimistic and cheerful. There were examples she showed via PowerPoint. The point I am making is that pain, suffering and misery generated from extreme privation and poverty can provide an excellent motivation for dreams of a better life. Most of the reviewers I read gave fodder for a debate as to whether or not this film was a successful alloy of reality and fantasy. This particularly relates to the Dance Scene over the closing credits. What came to mind to me were the closing credits to PREDATOR (1987). Here, after all the grisly violence, Richard Chaves, playing 'Poncho', looks at us with a smile from between the covers of a SGT. ROCK comic book. This gesture is an echo of an often quoted remark made by Alfred Hitchcock that I think serves well here. That is, ""It's only a mooovie..."".I recall one reviewer talking about how ludicrous it was for a person who is winning on a Game Show to find himself afterwards being rewarded with police interrogation, torture and electric shock. This definitely is an inversion on the principle of Rewards and Penalties. But I seem to recall a fellow in the middle east who also got the right answers to many things who fared much worst. So this experience, while fictional in this film, is not without precedent in real life. The other thing that was remarkable was how the lead character, Jamal Malik as played by Dev Patel, seemed to get many of his right answers for the Game Show from traumatic experiences in his past. Usually, it seems to me, people tend to remember most vividly the more pleasurable impressions and winning is often followed by rewards of some kind. This was a novel twist that I didn't actually see as representative of real life, but the kind of cultural inversion that might well be what people in extreme poverty experience on an every day basis. Hence there lies the misery. You come up with the right answer and you get punished; and most of your right answers or solutions are from grappling with painful incidents in Life rather than the realization or contemplation of pleasure. Whether you agree with this central idea or not of screenwriter Simon Beaufoy, I have to admit it was an original tack to take.The scene where Jamal's brother, Salim, played by Madhur Mittal, shoots down a Crime Lord he is working for while sitting in a bathtub filled with money is particularly insightful to me. He is subsequently massacred immediately by the Crime Lord's henchmen, but the symbolism is unmistakable. Here you have an individual who has been poor all his life, and could only achieve upward mobility through wielding a gun and committing murder. What does he dream about in his final moments? Making his past die and coming back in a future life so wealthy he does not have to resort to criminal activities and the gun to survive. This is a particularly Eastern concept swaddled and wrapped up in a Western style shootout. The villainous brother Salim transforms himself into a hero and while in uttering his last words, ""God is Great"", indicates that he fully expects the one on high to keep his end of the bargain.Danny Boyle's direction is crisp and exhilarating. Freida Pinto is a suspenseful surprise towards the finale in a narrative constructed out of twists and unexpected reversals. These finally lead to a Bollywood Dance Off between the three lead characters in all of their temporal incarnations to 'Jai Ho', one of the memorable pieces that make up the award winning score provided by A. R. Rahman.There was a reviewer who commented on the fact that most of Jamal's answers were based upon a chain of coincidence. He did not feel that it was particularly true to life. But I remember something I once saw on WHEEL OF FORTUNE. Pat Sajak spun the wheel for the last time and hit the one thousand spot. He added another four thousand to it, I believe, to make it an even five thousand. The first two contestants had money to bid, while the third contestant, I think a Hispanic gentleman, looked like he would go home with nothing. Anyway, the contestants started calling off letters and the Hispanic gentleman called off a letter that appeared in the answer more times than the other two contestants. Suddenly, he had come from nothing to leading in the last few moments of the game. He went on to get the right answer to win the whole thing.It might have been coincidence, but it was real life, too.",Slumdog Millionaire
193,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,One of the most inspirational and beautiful stories ever told on film,10,18 December 2008,"First off, you need to believe the hype surrounding this film. Whether it be one of the most gripping and heartwrenching stories ever shown on film, or the wonderful direction of Danny Boyle, everything you've heard about this film is true, as Slumdog Millionaire is not only one of the best films of the year, but one of the best I've ever seen.I've never been more sure of a film's greatness this quickly before. Even for my all time favorite films, it took a few viewings to make them my favorite. Not this one. The story behind this incredible journey is inspiring, as are the technical achievements of it. It's a capsule that will transport you into an entirely different culture, and give you an experience that should stick with you for a long time.For those that do not know, the film's plot follows Jamal Malik, who is one question away from winning the Indian version of ""Who Wants to Be A Millionaire?"". However, once he is suspected of cheating, Jamal uses his past as a ""slumdog"" to explain how he knows the answer to every question. What follows is easily the best story of 2008 on film, and it would be a crime to tell you any more.Though Slumdog Millionaire focuses on three characters in particular, it's hard to review all of the actors...Mostly because a grand total of NINE different actors portray each of the characters in total, three each for each time period. However, that doesn't stop Dev Patel from turning in an Oscar worthy performance as the oldest version of Jamal. His performance, as well as those of the other two boys who play Jamal, carve out one of the most likable characters you'll ever find, because of his perseverance, determination, and unwavering kindness. This is more of a case of an actor riding the coattails of such a well written character.Freida Pinto as the oldest version of Latika did a wonderful job in such a pivotal role despite limited screen time. She was a joy to watch, both from a movie goer's standpoint and a male's standpoint, as she's unbelievably gorgeous. There is no weak spot in the cast, right down to all the other actors who play the kids, as well as the adults in the film. It's one of the best ensembles of the year.Though Slumdog Millionaire is an ""inspirational"" movie, it is not without its darker themes, as it deals with deception, betrayal, and the brutality of living in the life that Jamal must lead. It's even more amazing how kind and caring Jamal is despite the environment the film takes place in.The awesome genre director Danny Boyle may already have his masterpiece with this film, and I really think he hasn't even hit his peak yet, as this would be tough to top. It takes a lot of ability to bring such a fine script to the screen without messing it up, but Boyle does a beautiful job with his vivid sets, as well as camera work that reminds me of his excellent film, ""28 Days Later"". Though this film is vastly different, they share the similar theme of survival, something that is a recurring theme in all of Boyle's films. He was already one of my favorite directors, but now he may be getting close to David Fincher for the top spot.As I've already said, the sets, camera work, and editing are all flawless, but I think it's the film's score that really sets the tone, as it flows so well with the setting, characters, and the story itself. This was part of the reason I was in tears at the end, which really doesn't happen to me all that often. Every aspect of the film is at such a high level that it all blends together perfectly to craft what may be the best movie of 2008.Slumdog Millionaire, in short, is a film that cannot be missed by anyone. It's an inspiring and beautiful story that will move anyone. I know it's already one of my favorites, and it may end up staying there for a very, very long time.",Slumdog Millionaire
194,ikanboy,A decent attempt for Bollywood to go Hollywood.,7,26 December 2008,"Even though the movie is directed by a Brit, the movie still has it's roots set firmly in Bollywood. I don't know if it was intended for a wider western audience, but it was certainly intended to appeal primarily to it's base: the Indians. All of the usual Bollywood touches are there; the soap operatic drama, the manufactured tension, the boy gets/loses/searches for girl, and of course the dramatic ending, where hero wins both fame, fortune, and the girl. Unfortunately what is also there is the unsophisticated/adolescent populist tone of most Bollywood movies. But fortunately we get spared the dragged out musical number. Or perhaps, for western audiences it was expunged!The idea is fascinating. Put a boy from Mumbai's slums and have him become an overnight sensation on the Indian version of ""who wants to be a millionaire."" How does he know so much trivia? For every question we see something in his harder than hard scrabble life that has given him the answer, and which he has retained. The death of his mother to anti Muslim mobs; the stint in a beggars prep school run by asocial thugs - shades of Fagan and Twist; the growth of his brother from street gamin to mobster gunsel.The view of life in the slums goes from depressing to horrific, and while one brother Jamal stays centered to a basic morality, his brother, more unstable from the start, sheds his street punk facade for the big time, and sheds his brother (and steals his girl) in the process.What doesn't work is the host of the TV show. A self serving, preening, ambitious, hollow character, who acts more as a cattle prod than an MC. What definitely doesn't work is the way he decides to find out how the boy knows the answers. This may play in Mumbai but it ain't going to play in the west, where TV hosts who project their insecurities out on the contestants sadistically don't survive. Arrogant pricks, sure, but sociopaths? Will he answer the final question? That one question we know will be asked, because they give us several hints early on. Who will he call as his ""phone a friend?"" Here the movie separates itself from the well known rules of the show. Those who are ""friends"" are holed up somewhere next to a phone, and a computer, and probably a gaggle of helpers, not, as in this movie, at the end of a cell phone whose owner doesn't even know she/he's being called. And the final question? In the US or Europe it would go for a third of the price.",Slumdog Millionaire
195,Jay_Exiomo,Jai Ho!,8,16 February 2010,"Slumdog Millionaire is the schmaltz that Hollywood is known for. But credit Danny Boyle, characteristic visual artist he is, for delivering an earnest crowd-pleasing melodrama that unabashedly embraces its characters' oh-so heartfelt triumphs against adversities and cynicism, and hits the right notes in the process. Ditching complicated narratives that usually take the better of his films' characters, Boyle's film (co-directed by Loveleen Tandan) entrenches itself in its glorification of love, friendship, and destiny (or perhaps karma), composing them and their cacophonous Indian backdrop in cross-processed film colors, slanted camera angles, and fiercely rapid editing. Brimming with joy and sentimentality, Simon Beaufoyt's script (from Vikas Swarup's bestselling book Q&A) narrates through a fractured timeline the saga of Jamal (Dev Patel), an 18-year old Indian boy who despite having raised in the slums and having no formal education, manages to get to the final round of the local edition of the TV show Who Wants to be a Millionaire? Such feat catches the attention of local police who, believing he is cheating, interrogate, torture, and mock him; and to whom he calmly explains every momentous detail in his life - diving in a pile of poo to have an autographed picture of his favorite Bollywood actor, watching his mom die in the hands of anti-Muslim rioters, his misadventures with older brother Salim (Madhur Mittal) etc -- that ties into his knowledge of the questions' answers, as well as why he joined the contest in the first place -- to meet the girl he loved since childhood: Latika (Frieda Pinto). Slumdog Millionaire is absolutely predicated to the notion that the staunch devotion one has to achieving something and the unwavering love for someone is ultimately rewarded by destiny -- or any Higher Being for that matter -- a concept not lost on Boyle, who relentlessly surrounds his characters with the festive environment of their country as they circuitously find their ways into reconnecting with each other, capped by the Bollywood-style musical number in the end. It's an unabashedly romantic fairytale, and Boyle's eye for beautiful images and proficiency for crisp storytelling enhance a tale where well-meaninged people are rightfully rewarded in beautifully mysterious ways.",Slumdog Millionaire
196,mardalsfossen01,Good movie but feels too polished,7,18 March 2020,"I don't know if it's the actors, the screenplay or the fact that it's Bollywood, but something feels off for it to be the perfect movie. But it does stand out and is worth seeing. Good idea for a movie.",Slumdog Millionaire
197,Bob Pr.,Fascinating look at modern India,9,16 February 2009,"Tentatively -- 8 out of 10 stars (I'll have to see it a couple more times to finally decide) This is a movie about life primarily in Mumbai/Bombay, India, as seen through the life, struggles for survival, challenges, and aspirations of 3 street urchins, two brothers (Salim & Jamal), and a girl (Latika) as they grow up from their preteens to their twenties.The 3 are Muslim in a divisive culture -- Hindu & Muslim -- and their parents are murdered, they are orphaned in a fratricidal attack by fundamentalist Hindus on Muslims. The film's narrative shows how they survived from then through early adulthood.I had problems understanding probably 25-33% of the dialog, sometimes because of accents, sometimes for whatever other reasons (my own hearing problems?) -- soundtrack, foreign language, etc.The panoramic views of India's civilization, its mixtures of poverty and wealth, ancient and modern, means of surviving, its varied levels of comfort, are unparalleled. Have you ever called a Customer Hotline and been answered by someone you figured was in India? Then you'll appreciate some scenes.Most critics give this movie a 9/10 or 10/10. I need to see it again to really decide.I can say that the background music was superb, the actors playing the early, middle, and later years of the principal characters, the ""3 musketeers,"" were excellent and Latika -- in her various ages -- became increasingly more beautiful. As a professional family therapist, I found the later divergence between the two brothers to be quite plausible (although not inevitable). Nothing was out of place, out of belief, for this clinical psychologist -- a level reachable by maybe only 30-40% of films.Some people who want a very propelled, tight and structured narrative may not much appreciate this film.But those of us who especially appreciate a film that conveys a very intimate glimpse into other cultures will feel greatly rewarded.",Slumdog Millionaire
198,tnrcooper,A bit too credulous for me,6,14 November 2010,"Yes, this is a good film, but for my money it isn't a great film. It's a feel-good film, sure, but to me the good feeling isn't earned in a plausible enough way. ""Oh tnrc75, you're just too bitter, it's just a movie"" I hear you say. Well fine, it's a movie, but given the immense poverty in Mumbai and the unfathomable societal problems, I find a movie which is so feel-good is like ignoring an 800 pound gorilla in a room. Yes it's wonderful that the plucky protagonists Latika and Jamal wind up together at the end. It's great that the boys escape from the slavery to which they at one point seemed destined. It's wonderful that Latika (Freida Pinto) escapes the clutches of mob boss Javed (Mahesh Manjrekar) who runs Mumbai. But given the problems and the extent of the problems in India, I found that adhering this feel-good story to such a mass of intractable problems pressed me to suspend my disbelief more than I felt comfortable. It's nice we can find an inspiring (fictional) story....but what about telling the story of the wrenching poverty, short life expectancy, and gross corruption in the government of Mumbai? There is some wonderful acting in the film, in particular from the actors playing the youngest versions of Jamal, Latika, and Salim (Ayush Khedesh Mahekar, Rubina Ali, and Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail). Given the tragic nature of the material, I found their performances astonishingly affective. I hope that they are able to remain actors if that is what they so desire. The direction from Danny Boyle is excellent, the cinematography is moving, and the music is great. There are many things to credit in this movie. I just can't find it in myself to give this film a higher rating given the welter of massive problems which beset India. I find that crediting work such as this distracts fortunate Western audiences to giving money or choosing government leaders who will try to diminish the problems which make the ultimate triumph so inspiring to so many.",Slumdog Millionaire
199,mistoppi,Amazing and thrilling,8,26 March 2017,"The story is intriguing, and it shows the worst and best of India. It shows the slums and brutality, but also the glamour of the rich. And the line between the two is clear, because not everyone is happy to just let a ""slumdog"" to become a millionaire and change the dynamic. But of course that's not just India, this is pretty much every country, where the differences between the poor and the rich are growing.And this movie is so thrilling. Towards the end I was ready to scream, because I was so excited. I was hopeful and scared at the same time and had no idea what would happen to Jamal, would he get the answer right or wrong. One of the key features of this film is the structure. The narrative isn't chronological, and instead it's mostly told in flashbacks. That's always risky, but in Slumdog Millionaire it's used amazingly. It tells you what you need to know and when you need to know it, not sooner than needed. This gives that certain air of mystery when you don't yet know everything, but you want to.I wasn't really into the love story, but also I couldn't think what would make it better, so I probably shouldn't go into that.Slumdog Millionaire is an amazing movie, very thrilling. There were several little things bothering me, but all in all it's astonishing and definitely deserved its win.",Slumdog Millionaire
200,CineCritic2517,Krusty presents: The Cheesy and Schmaltzy Show.,1,18 May 2009,"Since it received no less than 8 Oscars, I foresaw that Slumdog would not be of my liking, but I was frankly still baffled that the picture did not even meet my poorest of expectations, turning out to be just another overcheesed melodrama and an altogether quixotic mess of a film.With leads totally bereft of any charisma and zero chemistry between them, I progressively wondered who exactly I was supposed to root for. I think at some point I went for the game show host, since he was apparently paying the game money out his own pocket? and was obviously the victim of a swindle, much like myself.Come on, people don't instantly become of interest or garner sympathy just because they had a rough time. It takes a believable backdrop, a solid script and character development to achieve this. This picture fails terribly on all these counts and does so rather conspicuously, much like a cartoon or a parody. Oh, this was a realistic portrait of a typical slum in Bombay? They must have recently painted and vacuumed the place then.Heavy handed and utterly contrived situations furthered my annoyance as the movie turned into an inconceivable question and answer game where queue back sequences, in perfect chronological alignment, conveniently allowed the main lead to be able to rush through the game show, never showing the proper emotion or physical reaction such a tense situation surely would bring. No wonder the comic book villain cops didn't buy the lead's explanation that he simply knew all the answers. Our poor lead is beaten and tortured as the morally bankrupt cops try to force out a confession. But after a few weepy lifetime tales, the cop miraculously turns from foe to friend acting like the father one never had. Please give us a break.And what was up with these kids being able to speak perfect English all of a sudden? Since when is the WWTBAM show broad-casted live? Since when do you only need to answer 6 questions in this quiz and what in God's name is so glorious or symbolic about being shot to death in a bathtub full of money? Why is it that nowadays films with a story line that would really only be suitable for young children with its simplistic and utterly unrealistic plot points, seem so fit to gather so much general acclaim from a mature audience? I know people are easy to manipulate with these sorts of rags to riches claptrap, but surely this level of schmaltz and insultingly lame and predictable story progression would open up a few eyes here and there?I guess that the better the movies come, the worse they actually are.",Slumdog Millionaire

It's premise, that the various events in the tough life of a kid from the slums of Mumbai enable him to know all the answers on ""Who wants to be a Millionaire?"" is brilliant and Danny Boyle translates this idea to the screen very well.Although overrall this is unashamedly a feelgood movie and the ending is fairly predictable this doesn't mean that it doesn't pack a few tough punches as it depicts life of the poor in India. Boyle has said that once he arrived in India he went the flow and surrendered to the hectic pace of life in Mumbai. This is shown in a number of excellent scenes in the shanty towns of the city.The performances are all excellent particularly from the child actors in the first half of the film and from Amil Kapoor as the quiz show host. I'd definitely recommend this film to anyone.",Slumdog Millionaire

Throughout movie you are being feed with a great deal of life altering moments, sometimes pure survival moments that have led to final moment and pure happiness after all tragedy, pain and suffering that Jamal experienced. At moments it was extremely painful to watch the movie because of cruelty and pain that was obviously present on our lead man but sometimes it felt like is just taking too long to get to real story telling. Script was amazing with such great and heartfelt moments alongside with beautiful and magnificent directing of Danny it was a recipe to success. Movie is also light as some points where there are songs being singed and it just elevates movie.

203,ssvikas,"Improbable instances, but scores on quality storytelling",8,29 January 2009,"The word ‘slumdog’ really doesn’t exist, or is it, especially after the movie’s success at getting itself nominated at the academy awards! Probably, the usage has to do with the context of the story that emphasizes fate in the case of a boy from the scum of the society winning twenty million rupees in ‘Kaun Banega Crorepati’; our very own desi version of ‘Who wants to be a Millionaire?’ The story emphasizes destiny’s power.The protagonist Jamal is seen in Police custody, being interrogated over his successful run in the game show up to the penultimate question. While the inspector (Irrfan Khan) plays the questions on TV, the boy narrates the bizarre and sometimes touching stories about the past involved with each such question based on his years in the underbelly of the country’s economic capital. Some stories seem highly improbable though.Three actors portray the youngest, adolescent and adults for Jamal, his brother Salim and his love interest Latika. That makes it 9 actors! In my opinion the youngest three were the best, in their effective portrayal of life in slums and nursing dreams of a decent life. The trio are effective in scenes where they lose their family and the one in which they are captured by the local begging cartel from where they make a close escape.What makes the movie impressive its emphasis on the story rather on the usual stuff on individual performances. While specific performance of actors is nothing amazing, each plays his part in the story. However, none of the hosts on TV today would be as rude as Anil Kapoor is to the boy, when he says ‘we have a chaiwala here’ sarcastically. Such brashness is usually seen only in MTV Roadies! What did Boyle really want to show? Showing India to be full of slums seems to be an obsession for foreign filmmakers. Barring a mention by one of them that India is the centre of the world, the film is full of stereotypes. First, the slums, then the slumlords, filth, goons running rife and of course, the call centers. When will Hollywood ever learn that the very same city also has Nariman Point and Bandra Kurla Complex that really look and feel truly global! The movie has really hit the headlines for the simple fact that it has bagged nominations in key categories including the coveted best picture and director. Our desi Maestro AR Rahman is on the verge of getting an Oscar with two of three compositions being nominated! While Rahman has given better hits than ‘Jai Ho’, I am really glad that the international recognition has come last. And there are others for the technical awards.Despite bitter disagreements on the stereotyped portrayal of poverty, why do I rate this as a well made movie? Is it because of the ‘phoren’ tag? Surely not! If you want to see plain story telling with perfect editing, no redundant scenes explaining every little detail, go for it. For the Oscars though, I believe Indian films could have made history long ago; if only the powers that be didn’t succumb to lobbying that led to sending lousy films.",Slumdog Millionaire
204,pivic,"Underwhelming, yet fairly good",6,4 September 2009,"Seeing that this film has won basically every accolade known to humankind in 2008, I'm actually underwhelmed, especially considering how this is from the man who directed ""Shallow Grave"" and ""Trainspotting"". This time, he covers the life of a boy in India, one who competes for several million rupees in a TV game-show. His life flashes before our eyes as he is apprehended post-show, suspected of cheating, while we witness him growing up. Love, loyalty and the despicable caste-system is in focus here. I think the film was coherent, at times nearly made me cry (which isn't hard, though) but sorely missed any type of avant-garde and even - I think - a fresh view on love between the main character and his girl, which was quite supernatural in a bad way. As a collection of entertainment, this film is good, yet slightly disappointing. Including M.I.A.'s ""Paper Planes"" into the soundtrack helped, though.",Slumdog Millionaire
205,brianberta,This is a very violent film which is guaranteed to move you,8,24 May 2015,"This is a somewhat predictable but lovely film which combines an honest look at poverty in India with one of the best love stories in recent years.Jamal who wants to find his long lost love Latika, goes on a game show called ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"". After he's suspected of cheating, he's interrogated and he starts to explain how he knew all the answers.To say that this is expertly shot would be an understatement. It would be nearly impossible for another movie to win ""Best Picture"" over it. Every shot is amazing and not a single one seems worse than the last.The clever structure of the film uses the backstory to explain how he knew each of the answers to show what life is like for much of India's population. Even some of the more disturbing things that go on are detailed very well in the movie.The actors all did a great job. Especially the younger cast which is rather surprising considering that this is their first time acting for many of them. They acted well and I was sold in the first 20 minutes.Unfortunately, the film's strength falters near the end. Blaming plot contrivances on ""fate"" seemed lazy and the happy ending felt a bit hollow to me. But besides this, this is still a powerful and moving film which will entertain you all throughout it.This is a great movie. It has great acting and it was expertly shot.

206,galensaysyes,The feel-bad movie of the year,4,17 May 2009,"""The feel-good movie of the year!"" promises the quote headlined on the DVD jacket; and that certainly was how the movie was sold. Remembering previous movies directed by Danny Boyle--stories about miserable people in dead-end situations--I wondered what his idea of a feel-good movie would be.I found out soon enough: a story about even more miserable people at a dead end even more definite; a story that begins in torture and ends in a double murder, with betrayal, abduction, theft, robbery, mutilation, and more murders along the way. The movie's claim to feel-good status rests on a ""happy ending"" that takes up perhaps five minutes and feels more like an appendix, the story proper having concluded as it commenced, i.e. miserably. The ending didn't make me feel good, and I don't see how it could inspire such a feeling in anyone who was paying it close attention.How did it make me feel? Confused; because it seemed to follow from nothing that had preceded. The boy and the girl live happily ever after, in prosperity and contentment--but no, that isn't actually the ending; that's only our inference from the ending. The movie doesn't show it, and what a movie doesn't show in effect doesn't happen. The actual ending is that the boy and the girl meet and kiss. And even that is...well, what is it? It isn't realistic, and can't have been intended to be taken as such. But neither is it romantic, since the movie lacks the layer of sentiment that such an ending would require. It isn't fantastical, and it isn't satirical. In fact, it makes no sense, however you try to read it.The inexplicableness of the conclusion led me to look back at the story more critically, and when I did I found it the same all through. I don't know what mode it's supposed to be in. It's based on what sounds like the ""happy idea"" of traditional comedy: a poor boy competes in a TV quiz show and amazes everyone by knowing all the answers, since every one of them is something he has discovered during one of the major events in his life. But the movie isn't a comedy. And supposing it were, I still wouldn't know what the point of the idea was. Again, it clearly isn't an observation from real life. Is it intended as an optimistic statement, showing that all experience yields knowledge? Or as darkly comic, showing that after the many horrors the boy has endured, all he has to show for it is a few negligible bits of trivia? Or as inspirational, in that he turns a life of defeats into victory? One can only guess.The best clue the movie offers is the structure, as far as it can be discerned in spite of the director's efforts to fragment it. From it I would guess that the original novel was a step or two distant from reality. The story is laid out in a series of discrete episodes from the boy's life, each containing the answer to one of the questions on the quiz show. In the movie we hear the question, we see the flashback relating to it, and then we flash-forward again to the answer. This seems more artificial and tedious when acted out literally than it would on the page. And paradoxically, the movie's attempts to disguise its repetitiveness only make it seem more intrusive. Had it been treated in the same way as a recurring pattern in music, it might have given the movie a solid form. As it is, it's constantly broken up: sometimes we're in the TV studio as the quiz show is going on, sometimes we're in a police station watching it; the shifts are so random that often we don't know where or when we are. In fact, it wasn't until well into the film that I grasped the boy wasn't only replaying his life in memory, he was also telling it to the police. Once we know this, we can't be sure whether we're seeing events as he's recollecting them, as he's recounting them, or as they originally happened. Clarity appears not to have been the director's primary objective.What he does seem to have been after is to keep things moving. And he does succeed at that. This is a running, jumping, and not-standing-still film. For instance, it contains two street chases that go on much longer than needed--if either sequence were needed--with no apparent purpose other than to add some physical action. The scenes of violence raise the same suspicion, and come off seeming sensationalized, however undoubted the reality they reflect. Probably Boyle has a genuine concern for the victims he portrays, but his hyping of the atrocities they have to endure tends to call that into question, as does the fact that the same kinds of bad things happen in his zombie and space movies as in this purported social document. And frankly, I couldn't help feeling that a lot of it was just the director superimposing himself onto the material. At the end, indeed, he does so almost literally. In what would have an enjoyable dance number in the Bollywood style, he continually pastes credits on top of the dancers, as well as cutting away from them every few seconds. He seems unable to keep himself out of it.Similarly, he hashes up the narrative, jumping from one stage of the boy's life to the next, while paying scant attention to how he got from one to the other, and never slowing down enough to show what he feels and thinks. That is especially true when it comes his relations with his brother, so critical to the story, which are depicted only in the most generalized and movie-ish way.If I'm going to watch a meaningless movie, I'd rather it were a feel-better one.",Slumdog Millionaire
207,jemps918,"funny and heartwarming, modern without being cold...",9,12 January 2009,"Slumdog Millionaire deserves its Golden Globe sweep (Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Director, Best Original Score, Best Screenplay). The surprise hit will jolt you out of your ennui from all sides.

He is accused of cheating, however, and to explain how he managed to answer each question, he recounts the fascinating tale that is his life.Director Danny Boyle (Sunshine, 28 Days Later, The Beach) and director for India Loveleen Tandan produced a frenetic film that still manages to be riveting enough to focus on equal parts colorful Indian landscape and gritty human reality, allowing you to experience a wide range of emotions. The original score by A.R. Rahman complements the visual assault with a fluid infusion of Indian-flavored electronic beats.The film is brilliantly cast, with Dev Patel as the older Jamal, Madhur Mittal as Jamal's older brother Salim, and Freida Pinto as the older Latika, Jamal's childhood friend and ultimate love interest. The three main characters' stories unravel from their past lives, and the actors who play them in their early teens and childhood all contributed marvelously (Boyle was reportedly crushed to learn of some of child actors' real poverty-stricken lives, and ensured them of their education and trust funds).Slumdog Millionaire is a socially-relevant drama that's also funny and heartwarming, modern without being cold.

The adult Jamal, played by Dev Patel, comes off a little wooden. Freida Pinto as the adult Latika does a bit better, but all she is really asked to do is look beautiful, which she does effortlessly.This movie is relentlessly depressing, living in a world of a nearly sub-human subsistence struggle. India is presented as a filthy, corrupt, and thoroughly disgusting place; one spends much of the movie thanking God for allowing you to not have been born there. There is the occasional inappropriate background song. And there are some elements that simply do not work, such as the child diving into a pit of excrement and then obtaining a celebrity's autograph. For these things, I gave it nine rather than ten stars.Well worth a viewing.",Slumdog Millionaire
210,kyle-cruse,I am impressed,9,5 April 2009,"It's hard to know what to say about ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" but I will do my best to put my feelings to words. The simplest way I can express my thoughts on this film is to say that I am impressed. First of all, this film has a completely unique concept, something very refreshing to someone like me who has seen quite a few movies. The plot involves a young man who has lived in the slums of India his whole life. When he has a chance to go on India's version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,"" he knows the answers to nearly all the questions. He is arrested on the belief that he is cheating, since someone who has lived a life such as his should not know as much as he does. The rest of the film is told in flashbacks as he tells his life story, and how events in his life helped him know all of these answers. It's a fascinating story, especially when told in this manner. Although the plot seems fairly predictable, you'll find yourself watching every scene carefully to catch the details that make it interesting, and you'll soon realize that almost anything you predicted about the plot is wrong. I also liked this film because although it was a drama, the events were never so heavy and depressing that the film was unwatchable. The film is an eye-opener to the conditions of the slums in India, but there are some funny moments as well, such as the young boy pretending to be a tour guide of the Taj Majal, though he clearly knows nothing about it. Perhaps it's not an absolutely perfect film, since the events of the man's life and the questions on the show can be a bit coincidentally. Truthfully, however, I didn't mind. This is a watchable, moving film that entertains and fascinates. Recommended, and worthy of Best Picture.***1/2 out of ****",Slumdog Millionaire
211,ozjeppe,"Most of the way an exhilarating, visually blinding rags-to-riches tale!",7,28 July 2010,"In contemporary Mumbai, teenage telemarketing company clerk Jamal gets a shot at winning the jackpot on the famous TV quiz show ""Who wants to be a millionaire""... and after suspicions of how a poor, uneducated slumdog like him can get so far, he is arrested, accused of cheating.Oscar-winning, widely praised urban rags-to-riches story gets a tremendous boost from the ingenious, dream-like (yet not too unrealistic) idea of connecting Jamal's ability to know the answers with crucial details of his hard childhood as an orphan, beggar and petty thief. Most of the time an exhilarating movie, filled with both harrowing and joyful scenes of impoverished street children's conditions.Told like a blindingly visual tornado, swirlingly paced, edited and photographed, in the similar style - and in bits, theme - of ""City of God"". It could have used more of that latter film's jagged edge, though, as the overall impact is marred by slightly sugary and conventional finale and the one-dimensionality of surrounding characters: The bad guys are extremely bad, and the role of Latika is unfortunately diminished into a flat love interest without a personality of her own. Still extremely sympathetic and an interesting comparison to ""Salaam Bombay"".7 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",Slumdog Millionaire
212,krzysiektom,spirituality defeats materialism,9,24 February 2009,"Wow, that is some beast of a movie. I mean, it can be analysed and commented on from various points of view, there are a few layers in it, it is rich, whether structurally and technically, or story-wise. It is even difficult to describe it in a few words, a film depicting acts of violence, including against children, the extreme poverty and humiliation, yet leaving one with a good feeling at the end. A piece of real life melodrama without a hint of melodramatic cheap effects, a story told in a western modern way yet reaching for the Bollywood or soap-melodramas inspiration and their simple stories about basic human yearnings and feelings. A modern story which is Dickensian in scope and method. Not to mention the invigorating, flawless musical score, the direction and editing. The only moment I raised my eyebrows was when the brother of the main hero had the sudden change of heart and character which, I do not think, is likely in real life, but I guess they wanted to show how religion played a part in his spiritual being and also defend the film a bit in the eyes of the Muslim community. Nothing wrong with that, I guess. I also doubt that the feelings of 10-year olds can win the test of time, especially in harrowing circumstances. The main theme of the film for me is the duality of human existence: the material and the spiritual inner life, with Boyle showing himself to be an idealist, a romantic on the side of the spiritual, the film juxtaposing in a striking manner the stark, brutal poverty and humiliation on the one hand and the persisting purity of thought, feelings and actions of the main pair on the other. They suffered so much since early childhood, yet their love is pure and conquers all. I know, it sound corny, yet the marvel of this film is that it works just fine!",Slumdog Millionaire
213,kunalkhandwala,The sensational rags to riches story,8,29 November 2008,"The country of 1.6 billion watches the gripping moment of Who wants to be a millionaire being hosted by Anil Kapoor as Jamal Malik reaches the penultimate question. The throbbing background music of the show resonates with Jamal's heart beat and the beatings that he suffers in the police remand room as he is taken in for interrogation on the suspicion that he might have cheated his way to come this far on the show that usually requires a well educated genius to even get half way through. Will he survive the night? Will he face the question tomorrow? Will his destiny fall upon him or will he make his own? 'Slumdog Millionaire' answers all your questions and in epic style.This is your quintessential rags-to-riches story with Jamal (Dev Patel) playing the protagonist, raised in the filthiest slum of Bombay with a series of horrific events that led him to escape from the city after a communal civil war took away from him whatever he had. A brief encounter with an underground ring of child beggar trainers shows us the grim reality of how humans can fall to unknown levels to achieve their sadistic objectives, from which, our hero runs leaving behind another memory, another piece of the puzzle that makes up his traumatic yet eventful childhood. Jamal's childhood is influenced by his only brother in crime, Salim (Madhur Mittal) and the beautiful Lathika (Frieda Pinto) who is the angel he has adored since his early days of being abandoned in the city's rain. Each of the characters is played by different actors at various stages in the character's life and one does not realize that because of the brilliant screenplay and performances. From the filth of the slums to the ring of beggar trainers to knick picking in trains and tourist attractions in Agra to make a living and then to the underworld crime lords of Bombay; Jamal and Salim together find devious ways of living until an incident involving Lathika sends Jamal on a more righteous path by himself and he takes up an assistant (Chaiwala)'s job at one of Bombay's call centers. Fate brings him to the glamorous set of Who wants to be a Millionaire and as he answers every question, by reflecting upon his past and unfolding each event, he makes considerable progress. But his background of being a slum dweller and an uneducated 'chaiwala' at a call center puts the host in utter disbelief, thus leading to the Police interrogation. Irrfaan Khan and Saurabh Shukla are outstanding in portraying the typical roles of Bombay's Policemen who soon realize through Jamal's narration of his life that every piece of the puzzle that fits in to make Jamal's life so far is also a clue to the answers to the questions on the show. The screenplay in this aspect is exemplary even though it may have adapted from the novel 'Q&A'. Director Danny Boyle has a good understanding of the city and its eccentricities but he may have gone a little too far in portraying how dirty it gets but he's a foreign director and that is much expected of him. Meanwhile, on a parallel level, there exists a petulant love story between Jamal and Lathika that gives us the escapist romanticism that somehow blends in beautifully with the more intense, brutal and dark side of the film's story. This underdog tale is what we need for our escapism from life and as we see the slum child emerge through the grey shades of life onto the glittery world of fate's game, we cannot help but laugh out loud when in a moment of overjoyed disbelief, he asks the host (Anil Kapoor) if he is nervous before the next question! Such is the film's connect with the audience in all its splendor of colour, darkness, horror, filth, loss, deceit, hope, aspiration and love. We have seen heroes in films but this underdog is somehow more pleasing. Just go celebrate the film and its grand showdown of Bollywood song and dance with Jamal and Lathika swinging to A.R. Rehman's upbeat tunes.8.445 on a scale of 1-10.",Slumdog Millionaire
214,axlrhodes,The set up drags a little but the pay off in the final act makes it all worthwhile,8,8 December 2009,"A late comer to Slumdog ,i realised from the start i was watching a film that people loved and that i ought to love too.I was surprised to find myself tempted to stop the whole thing about 40mins in,as i found the set-up to the the inevitable conclusion to be a little tedious.That said, i stuck with the film and ended up coming away impressed. The last third of the film is the most engaging as we step into uncharted territory. The first two acts are basic set and explanation as to how we got to where we are,which i found more than a little tiring. The cast are all excellent though. The young actors in the film are a delight but be warned,the film features some surprisingly unpleasant moments. It had been billed as the 'feel good movie of the year' and it is 'feel good' although it seems that tag doesn't quite sit right. It is feel good in the same way that Shawshank is,our characters have to climb through the mud to get to the good stuff. We join them on that journey and the central love story of the film, which is in essence, what the film is, drives home the last third with an undeniably satisfying and quite joyful conclusion. Just stick with it if you find yourself wavering because the pay off is worth it.",Slumdog Millionaire

What a heartwarming journey three young Orphans take in a tale that is so reminiscent in the story of Romeo and Juliet, but you have to wait to the end of the film to see if Romeo gets his Juliet. The film locations, action scenes and the drama set against a Quizz show brings to the screen a story that is a global one and makes you laugh and weep all at the same time. It is just so exciting when you find a jewel of a film in SLUMDOG that brings such tremendously interesting characters to the screen. Bravo Simon Beaufoy on your writing SLUMDOG and for the collaboration with Danny Boyle in a film that jumps off the screen with such energy and zest. I can hardly wait until the Globes and Oscar Noms and I look forward to SLUMDOG right up there for awards.",Slumdog Millionaire
216,maximkong,Cheesy Ending was A Great LetDown to its Unconventional Perfection,7,24 November 2012,"just when i thought 2008 is lacking good movies, i didn't expect a movie of this calibre to come out. I understand why it wins all the categories in all of critic awards. The key -- A one-of-a-kind originality and level of raw detail unlike anything i have seen in my life. Boyle manages to make this movie so unconventional, via many award-winning aspects from the script (well done making a good story linking to the game who wants to be millionaire?) , screenplay, background detail, soundtrack etc. (camera-angle is very different to other movies, music score refreshing and unique, very intrinsic detail on India's poverty, though i doubt some parts of its accuracy. No matter how good other movies can be, they all have to bow hands down to slumdog's raw, unconventional power for these award categories.The style in this movie makes me wonder if this should be classified as a British film -- so unlike one. It may be like a documentary too...so like one. Again, the marvel of its unconventionality.However, there are flaws in this film as well, though i think these flaws somehow also make up to its unconventional features. Don't expect top-class acting here...besides the slum kids' performance (I heard that they are actually real slum kids getting paid to act), the rest are like what u expect in a low-class soap opera. Certainly the director fail to master all the details about India, especially towards the second half of the movie.The adult actors do not connect well with their past childhood characters, e.g. I don't believe the adult Jamal-version when he has been living an active, attentive and dangerous slum life throughout where survival with lots of guts and wits is a constant routine. I expect him to be more angry and street-wise, shown when he was in his teen stages.And note that the adult actors are too good -looking. Speaking of that, the teenagers jamal and Kamil are too clean to look like slum kids.Certainly it deserves to win whatever it won, but i have to say it is far from being the best movie of 2008. Apart from all that, the storyline is filled with many clichéd elements ,especially the disappointing cheesy ending, it might be more memorable if it based on something much larger and deeper than just a love story. Or if the director avoids the clichéd parts (he has already successfully win the hearts of millions with his unconventional work, so why does he resolve to that kind of ending?? how disappointing is that?). If u think about it, it is just an upgraded version of a typical bollywood style movie.",Slumdog Millionaire

The production values were excellent - as one would imagine - but the story just failed to pull me in.If you like predictable dramas spoken in a non-English language to boost the artistic value of a film clearly aimed at winning awards, then let the fact that it did achieve critical acclaim sucker you into wasting time better spent doing something else... like watching a film that's actually good.",Slumdog Millionaire

219,ltlacey,An uneducated orphan makes it to a popular game show and manages to answer all the questions.,3,26 June 2009,"First, I'll get out of the way what did work in this film. One, the scenery and cinematography. Two, though cleaned up, the abject squalor one sees in India, even in areas of prosperity. Three, that the audience is shown, for the most part, how Jamal knows the answers for most of the questions. That aspect of the film I really liked, and how his past was revealed through these questions. Otherwise, this film was a mess. First off, I found this movie one of the most boring films I have ever seen. I had no sympathy for any of the characters, even though we get a decent back story on the 3 main characters. None elicited any emotions from me whatsoever. The acting was sluggish, and for the most part, actually quite bad, and by most everyone in the film. I could see why the production company had so much press, even negative, to promote this movie. Another problem I had was that for a lot of the Hindi spoken we did not get subtitles, and some of it was important to the story. And though I noticed that all these uneducated, lower caste people spoke such good English, for some reason this did not bother me. Much. A ""smart"" street kid would learn a major language; otherwise, how else to survive? Well, that's how I saw it. And I waited a long time (Netflix) to get this movie, only to take 5 hours to get through it. It's a basic love story (for a girl; for one's brother; for one's life), and a story of how even the lowest can ""make it"" (have to have that happy ending you know), so if you want that, then this is the movie for you.",Slumdog Millionaire

But that's not to say Slumdog Millionaire doesn't deserve it, even if I think Benjamin Button should have gotten it instead. This movie is a very eloquent, artistic and cinematic venture that honestly left a smile on my face. Sure, it's a bit hammy and heavy-handed, but it works, and the story is told masterfully. There are some really tense dramatic moments here, and the movie being two hours long only feels like about ninety minutes - it flows wonderfully. The acting is great, even from the children, pulling you right in and keeping you there. And Freida Pinto is hot - even though she doesn't look a damn thing like the child version of her character. The only thing I did find a bit unbelievable was how every question Jamal was asked tied into his past and childhood somehow. I guess it's kind of realistic, because that's just how we learn things, but it's still a bit odd that every single question would tie in so snugly. Oh well. So Slumdog is a really good movie that I feel deserved the Oscar at the end of the day. It isn't really perfect, and I liked a few films from 2008 better, but am I going to complain when a film this good is getting such widespread praise? Hell no.",Slumdog Millionaire

The credibility of the academy awards has taken a severe beating due to constant and regular stoop downs over the years.Take for example Rocky (1976-77) or Training day .Please forgive me but i seriously have my doubts over the claim of Gandhi as an Oscar winner. A Beautiful Mind, American Beauty ....you name the movie and all that is there for us to see is mediocrity. mediocrity in direction,in screenplay writing and most importantly in characterisation and acting. Just like the mannerisms of Kingsley in Gandhi were hardly Indian Slumdog is hardly in touch with the reality which it wants to realistically potray. Firstly, Indians do not speak or talk or laugh or react the way they do in this movie. All their sensibilities, dialouges emotions and reactions are completely western. The movie is melodramatic to the point of being called bollywood jargon. I can bet my life on this that there have been brilliant Hindi movies with brilliant Hindi actors which should have won Oscars but didn't merely because the content they supplied was intrinsically Indian.I would like to compare Slumdog with Khosla ka Khosla . KKG is a new generation mainstream Hindi movie which quite realistically depicts the life of a middle class Indian and his family. their manner of speaking, laughing, their emotions are so honestly depicted that one cannot think otherwise.Slumdog to be honest is a farce . Not only does it lack honesty but also credibility. It is a typical feel god movie with ordinary performances by most of the cast. Dev Patel and Frieda Pinto are not impressive at all. The success of Slumdog thus once again proves that the Americans cannot treat foreign cinema like it deserves to be.

224,Benjamin_Cox,"Boyle's best for many, many years - 90%",9,14 September 2009,"A word of warning for those who like their Oscar winners - having seen it, I have to question whether this film is a deserved winner of eight Oscars. I don't think it's that good but this certainly is one of the best films of last year, fuelled by a fantastic story and frankly superb performances from every level of the cast and a director with a real passion not just for film-making but also the subject and setting. So it's a great film, OK? Just not a absolute time-defying classic.Newcomer Dev Patel plays the 18-year-old Jamal, a slum-dwelling street kid who gets onto Indian's version of the TV quiz show ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"". To everyone's amazement, he is just one question away from winning the jackpot when he is arrested at the request of the host (Bollywood legend Anil Kapoor) for cheating. Interogated by the police, Jamal explains how his life led to the answers through his childhood with brother Salim (Madhur Mittal) and his pursuit of the love of his life, Latika (Freida Pinto).One thing I can confidently say is that ""Slumdog Millioanire"" does for India what ""Lost In Translation"" does for Japan - it immerses you so completely in the culture that you feel you're almost on holiday. Not that India is all curries and the Taj Mahal - you get a sense that this is the real India, undiluted and as raw as you'll find on film. Thank director Danny Boyle for maintaining his vision and keeping the film grounded in reality to such a degree that the various dream shots (slow-mo and staccato effects, of which there are plenty) don't interfere too much. The non-linear storyline may confuse those with a short attention span as will the subtitled Hindi but again, because the younger actors are flawless in the roles, it still holds your attention despite the jumps. And to those who say the story is too much of a fairy-tale to be believed, that's never been a problem in movies before. I've never heard anyone criticise ""Casablanca"" for being too melodramatic or predictable, after all.It might not be the all-conquering movie-to-end-all-movies some of you may have expected but that doesn't stop ""Slumdog Millionaire"" being an essential movie to watch. Boyle has fashioned an incredible film out of something that, on paper, really shouldn't work and that IS worthy of an Oscar. I was expecting more of a cheery Bollywood feel to it and aside from the closing number, there isn't any of that - Boyle did do ""Trainspotting"", remember. But the best film are often the simplest and given the love and affection this picture earns from director to best boy, this is a film of class, colour and quality. It might not float your boat straight away but like a good chicken Madras, it slowly creeps up on you before blowing your head off. Brilliant.",Slumdog Millionaire
225,joestank15,Good little movie.,7,28 December 2008,"Slumdog Millionaire - A former street child Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) from Mumbai is arrested and questioned for knowing all of the answers on an Indian version of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"" He explains, in flashbacks, his past and how he has come to know all the answers to the questions. The film is shot and diced up with three time lines: Jamal's childhood, his experience on the show, and his recounting of both to the police. It's a cool novel way to tell a story that is essentially a love story between Jamal and Latika (Frieda Pinto)The first half of the film is gritty, urban and akin to realism in aesthetics. The rundown lived in qualities of India are rich and very human. I enjoyed them in Salaam Bombay and I liked them here. It's very pleasant to see India's culture unadulterated. India is beautiful and beautifully shot. I expect this film will get many props for Cinematography. The soundtrack is also very good, with many catchy easy-to-groove-to songs. The performances are all top notch. It's a sweet little journey Jamal and his big brother Salim (Madhur Mittal) are on. They commit all sorts of trickery and get into much hi-jinx to survive. It's the main contrivance of the plot (the catch) that is irritating, and leads to the pulpy fluff of the second half. Nearly EVERY question asked on the show pertains to this young man's life in some key way? He didn't study at all? I just have to roll my eyes, and did several times. Many of the questions are also dead easy in addition to corresponding far too easily with Jamal's past. It's less a tale of a poor man making it to fame and riches with his own abilities than being carried there by the movie gods.In the end, we have a rather good movie that should not be held up to the hype surrounding it. This happened for me with Babel a few years ago. It's a shame we have awards and award campaigning to cloud our judgments on films. This will probably be held up as better than it is by people looking for hope in our current depression.

227,pere-25366,A highly exhilarating and emotionally uplifting story,9,16 July 2016,"Danny Boyle's ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is an enthralling dramatic film with ingenious storytelling methods. Similar to The Life of Pi, another highly acclaimed film set in India which also includes Irffan Khan, we are given a story that chronicles the life journey of a young, orphaned Indian boy, one that does so with such a majestic, albeit harsh, realism which makes it a highly appealing experience for any moviegoer. Everything in this film was great - from the brilliant editing and cinematography to the general drive that is kept running by strong acting performances (many by children) and a fantastic narrative-style comprised of flashbacks into the life of our game show contestant, each of those which are cleverly intertwined into the ostensibly random questions presented on the game show. And that is what made this film, for me, so memorable. All of those small, seemingly trivial, details in scenes had this kind of inherent importance associated with it. The story necessitated that each detail be recalled and, in doing so, ensured that each detail have significance.Nominated for 10 Academy Awards in 2009 and winning 8 of them (including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay), this film was both a commercial and critical success. Slumdog Millionaire presents us with an exhilarating, descriptive story that dissects the origins of our protagonist and his time growing up in the impoverished streets of Mumbai. The energy in this film and realism of the slums is almost akin to that of ""City of God"" and the game show premise ensures a full throttle, electrifying pace. Seamlessly mixing intense drama and uplifting action, Slumdog Millionaire, along with its emotionally- charged momentum, is an absolute treat.",Slumdog Millionaire

It does have the same distributor and it is set for the same release period, and for anyone who hears this buzz, they will definitely not be disappointed.During the premiere of the final cut (in the words of director Danny Boyle) at the Toronto International Film Festival, the audience gave the film an incredibly enthusiastic response, and it went on to win the People's Choice Award. Boyle, who is somewhat like a British Richard Linklater for yet again surprising the audience with such diverse subject matter, worked his magic. He transcended genres and created a truly unique and energetic picture.Just about every aspect of this film deserves merit, and above all it belongs to Boyle, who managed to assemble such a massive achievement. The score by A.R. Rahman, with contributions from M.I.A., perfectly accompanies the action on screen. Still, it is great enough to be listened to on its own. With India as a backdrop, Boyle and his cinematographer have composed some remarkable images. The acting is roundly impressive, especially coming from the younger cast, almost all of which has never acted before.The film begins as Jamal (Skins' Dev Patel) is under interrogation by Mumbai police for cheating on India's version of Who Wants To Be a Millionaire, being only one question away from winning it all. As the inspector says, even doctors and lawyers cannot come close to the 20m rupee prize, and so Jamal, having grown up on the streets of Mumbai, cannot possibly know these things.

230,cdjh-81125,The Right Answer,8,4 September 2017,"Danny Boyle is known as one of the most unique directors working today, whether it be from his films Concepts or the direction he brings to them his directorial efforts can always be described as different and Slumdog Millionaire thrives as part of his filmography and film I truly appreciate, enjoy and think about. Boyle was the absolute perfect director for this project this has to be one of the most strangely directed movies I've ever seen and that is by no means a bad thing, it creates this flow in the film that ensures that the cuts between the different time periods are never jarring. He uses a lot of Dutch angles and bloated colour pallets that help to give this film its very distinctive tone, which is absolutely perfect, it's quite a light hearted film that has a lot of fun aspects and lightheartedness to it but never shies away from the horrors of the characters situations and never glamorises poverty. The character of Jamal Malik is so well written, he such a great well rounded character, which is even more impressive given the fact that his whole arc doesn't play out in a linear structure, when you see his character in present day and in his childhood you absolutely believe how he got to be the way he is in present day, the film portrays him as a sympathetic character because you see so clearly all the hardships he has been through but at the same time is also a very entertaining character, mainly in the flashback storyline. As I said the pacing of this film is perfect, it's fairly fast and very energetic and it keeps this pace for most of the run time and because the film is so well constructed the cuts between the different stories always as a natural flow to them and they play of each other very well. It keep you engaged and intrigued the whole time all from trivia questions.The location is a very prominent character in this movie, it's always used to its full advantage. When your in the slums of India you fully feel the poverty and desperation of the situation and it irritates me on every level when critics claim that this film glorifies situations like this. The game show itself was also used very well, it creates a lot of tension just at the thought of him getting the questions right or wrong but when the narrative unfolds the tension increases as you begin to realise the full reasoning behind Malik being in that situation in the first place. I have but one big issue with this movie and it is the central love story, my biggest issue being that it just came across as very cliché, in a film that has such a unique structure and directorial style it's disappointing to say that, it never really grabbed me and I would have been more than happy for the film to have simply focused around Jamal and his brother entirely. I truly believe that this is a film that anyone can connect too, it's go such a great central character, distinctive style, sense of location and a great heart that will make this movie enjoyable for just about anybody, while I wasn't a big fan of the love story it didn't take me out of this truly fantastic film that I think I can get more out of the more I watch it. 8.7/10: A- (Fantastic)",Slumdog Millionaire

233,Simon_Says_Movies,"If this film had a flaw, it was that it had to end.",9,13 January 2009,"Slumdog Millionaire is a remarkable film for a number of reasons. Not only is it simply sublime overall (which I will get into later) but it overcomes so many hurdles with such grace and ease, it is worthy of even more admiration. Mirroring director Danny Boyle's genre hopping career is Slumdog's story which seamlessly blends romance, comedy, drama, elements of mystery, action and a devastating portrait of the Mumbai slums. Along with this achievement, it is simultaneously rousing and uplifting, while being intimate and true starring unknown actors, yet has achieved mainstream success in spite of itself. And where so many films this year have failed, the ending, Slumdog only becomes more rewarding. Movies like this come along only once in a blue moon, and are something to be cherished, shared and loved.Following his successful excursion into Sci-Fi with Sunshine, Danny Boyle has teamed up with Bollywood director Loveleen Tandan and the duo have crafted a film that echoes Boyle's character intimacy and artistic style while being richly textured with Tandan's complex love and acceptance of her homeland's tragic dogmata. Framing the narrative is some of the best camera work and art direction of the year, impeccably placed original music and a buoyant score. Taking full advantage of their collective skill, the director's have used hand-held cameras to impeccable results, boasting kinetic energy along with a polish and steadiness that only masters could pull off. From this, the shots open up into breathtaking panoramas of the slums; rich, gritty and beautiful but never in a condescending or exploitative way. Who wants to be a millionaire? Want to or not, Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) is one question away from winning ten million rupees on the Indian version of the widely popular American gameshow. In between episodes, Jamal is whisked away into a police van and interrogated on a suspicion that he is cheating. For how could an uneducated 'slumdog' brought up from poverty make it so far? In custody, Jamal tells the story of how his life's journey along with his brother Salim (Madhur Mittal) and friend and secret love Latika (The stunning Freida Pinto) through tragedy, betrayal and danger had led him to know the answers and how, and truth behind why, he is on the show.The performances of all those involved are nothing short of flawless. From the child stars playing the three leads, to the matured versions, Patel, Mittal and Pinto all should have glowing careers ahead. If this film had a failing, it is that it had to end. For Slumdog Millionaire is such a roar and vibrant celebration of the true nature of the human spirit, and the true cost and meaning of love, it is a film that is both alright to, and effortless to love.

234,Pratik112,A Good Film By Danny Boyle - Worth Watching.,10,30 December 2008,"Not really knowing what this was all about except that it was filmed entirely in Mumbai, India and that it had a Bollywood Actor in it, I was totally surprised with it content.A Indian teenager, who lived in the slums in Mumbai (previously known as ""Bombay"") and works in a call centre as a servant, goes on to the famous game show, ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire,"" known in Hindi as ""Kaun Banega Crorepati,"" which was initially hosted by superstar Amitabh Bachchan when it started in India and then later by an equally superstar, Shahrukh Khan, in the hope of winning his girl, who he has known since his childhood days.The movie stars Dev Patel, Anil Kapoor, Freida Pinto, Irrfan Khan, Mahesh Manjrekar and Ayush Mahesh Khedkar. This is directed by Danny Boyle and Loveleen Tandon and the music score is by A.R. Rehman.Filmed entirely in India and mostly in its financial and entertainment capital, Mumbai, most of the scenes are filmed in the slums and this really brings out the reality of how lives in those slum areas as Boyle captures it as it really is. This also shows the reality of how children, from such areas are sucked into crime, begging and at a later stage of their lives, particularly females, into possibility of prostitution. Dev Patel is very convincing in his role as the teenager who comes from the slums but more than that it is his younger version, played by Ayush Mahesh Khedkar, who really makes it all look natural when it comes to acting a child who lives in the slum. He portrays what a child is like in that area and more so when it concerns big movie stars of ""Bollywood."" Freida Pinto, could have done a bit more in her role, but none the less, she has done a good job. Anil Kapoor as the host of the game show, made one feel rather uncomfortable when sitting opposite him in the chair as compared to the British host of the game, Chris Tarrant and of the Indian version of the game  Amitabh Bachchan and Shahrukh Khan, who made the contestants feel at ease. Irrfan Khan, who has done some good ""Bollywood"" movies, is good in this as well but it is Mahesh Manjrekar, in the role of ""Javed,"" once upon a time a gangster in the slum, that is perfectly cast.Watch out for Amitabh Bachchan's hand in this movie.This is a movie that is definitely one of the best this year and is worth watching.",Slumdog Millionaire
235,billion_mucks,Bollywood/ Hollywood weak morph.,4,29 August 2009,"Basically, Slumdog Millionaire is the transposition of clichéd American cinema into the den of Bollywood. All of the layers and sub-layers are so repeated and overly done that it causes no effect on the viewer. It's the same applied to third world countries, it's a simple deceptive notion.The love story, with the man running desperately to defend his loved one, with his impositions, maybe a criminal undercurrent with already seen and done mafia innuendos, classical tension moments in which time plays a cruel role already examined. Even the moments that seem to ""bring glow"" from the cramped, poor slums just seem overly edited and manipulative. In story terms, nothing is actually new in the movie. Thus, nothing is truly exciting, except for those who are relatively new to Hollywood, who are tricked into believing that ""glamour"" was actually strained from the sets and that India (or at least Indian cinema) is close to whatever Boyle tried to create.You've seen this thousand times, just in other countries and other cultures. Cool trick, uh?",Slumdog Millionaire
236,Craig_McPherson,Cinematic Perfection,10,2 January 2009,"Rarely in cinema has a movie so approximated perfection as Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire. Easily the best movie of 2008, and arguably of the past decade, the movie tells the story of Jamal Malik, an orphaned Muslim street urchin from the slums of Bombay who, as the movie begins, finds himself one question away from winning the jackpot on the Indian version of Who Wants to be a Millionaire.With the final question postponed until the next show, Jamal is whisked away by police for interrogation on suspicion of cheating. After all, how could a kid with no formal education possibly have gotten further than all comers before him, right? It's under this setting that the viewer is made privy to how Jamal knows the answers based on flashbacks to his life growing up on the streets, and a rich tableau it is.Boyle and co-director Loveleen Tandan, working from a script by Simon Beaufoy (The Full Monty) which was, in turn, based on the novel Q and A by Vikas Swarup, tell a tale that rich in plot twists, characterization, and so completely full of heart that it ought to be institutionalized viewing at film schools.Set against the backdrop of the India's rich social underbelly, we are introduced to a love story that spans years, as Jamal relentlessly pursues his childhood dream-girl Latika (portrayed by the stunning Freida Pinto as an adult), whom he meets while scouring India's garbage dumps for resellable scraps, while maintaining a love/hate relationship with his brother Salim. Along the way we are given insight into the moral makeup of each brother, and the ever growing divergent path that each will take later in life. At each stage, the acting by various cast members entrusted with depicting Jamal, Salim and Latika is uniformly seamless, further enhancing the movie's almost mesmerizing effect.Boyle, Tandan and Beaufoy work their movie canvas akin to Rembrandt as they spin their enthralling web, which is as perfectly plotted, paced, characterized, acted and edited, as possible, making this as close to cinematic perfection as can be.If you see one movie this year, make it this one. As a reviewer I can give it no greater accolade.",Slumdog Millionaire
237,Lucabrasisleeps,Danny Boyle's best film,7,29 January 2009,"I didn't expect to like this movie. When I heard the basic plot line I thought it would be a movie with fake characters and a tacky happy ending. Having seen some Indian English efforts, I didn't expect much from this. But I was wrong.The plot is quite unique. A boy Jamal(Dev Patel) from a slum goes on to win the Indian version of Who wants to be a millionaire. The focus in this movie is on how he knows the answers to the questions. This is quite an interesting concept and it has been executed well. What I liked about the movie is the portrayal of the characters in this movie. The characters seem real and down to earth. Unlike in some Indian movies, the main characters here are not entirely moral. An example is Jamal's brother. This is why the story rings true. It shows the travails of street children quite accurately. But it isn't too dark so it still can appeal to a lot of people.I am a bit disappointed to see Irfan khan in a short role here as I feel he is more capable than that. He has done well in his short role. Dev Patel as Jamal is a major find as he aptly expresses the anger of a slum boy who is suspected of cheating. The little boys who did the role of Jamal and Salim in the movie have done a wonderful job. The music by AR Rahman(I am a fan of his) is quite top notch and it shows that he does better music when exposed to a better screenplay. The whole ""suspected of cheating"" part is too unbelievable though. Would a slum boy, who is in the limelight now, be taken into custody without ANYBODY knowing? The last time there was a guy who won a huge amount, there was such a lot of publicity that the contestants became stars overnight. The same thing happened here so it is a bit unbelievable to note that nobody knew that he is missing. The happy ending part was a bit cheesy too but I don't mind happy endings. The scene with the toilet was quite unnecessary though seems to be characteristic of Danny Boyle. A related scene was in Trainspotting too(The only other movie I have seen of his). I have an aversion towards such scenes.Even if the movie is a bit cheesy, it gives a realistic picture of the situation on Indian streets and can be described as an Indian version of City of God. The movie captures the filth and crowded nature of Mumbai in such an exquisite manner. One of my favourite lines is when Jamal's brother proudly says that India is going global and he is at the centre of it. This line shows the influence of the mafia in Mumbai in so many sectors.9/10",Slumdog Millionaire

240,frankenbenz,Why Such Praise?,6,3 January 2009,"http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/One movie that won't be on my year-end best of 2008 list is Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire. What's surprising to me is that I might be the only critic on the web to not have it on their list. After watching it last night, I want to know: why all the love for a routine melodrama dressed up as something exotic?As you expect from Boyle, SM is exceptionally stylish, fluid and kinetic. The more I think about why so many people love this movie, the more I come back to how expertly the film is crafted. It is a hyper film, bristling with action, drama, emotion and energy. India makes for a truly epic backdrop, with splashes of color, clutter and exotic wonder. With the languages breaking in and out of English, Hindi and other regional dialects, SM feels like a completely foreign, yet utterly accessible movie. In nearly ever superficial way imaginable, SM strives to be a palatable form of culture shock. Based on its success, it seems Boyle has succeeded.For the first half of the film, the story's winding structure deliberately keeps you guessing, your head spinning amidst a whirlwind of backstory and puzzling present tense. But by about the halfway mark, I found my bearings, and once I did, the artifice of the film started to reveal itself. At this point, a very simple, but (potentially) revealing question popped into my head: if this whole thing was set in the USA with familiar actors and locations, wouldn't it just be another syrupy sweet romantic melodrama?Perhaps the real culprit was when the story and character's transitioned from childhood to maturity. With the first half of SM reminiscent of the adventures of Satyajit Ray's Apu, I was swept up and completely sucked in by young Jamal's struggles. But once Jamal was transformed into a young man, the events unraveled into a predictable teenage soap opera, with plot lines seemingly plucked from The O.C. or Gossip Girl.By the time the end credits started to roll and the cast of actors broke into a choreographed song and dance routine, I felt like Boyle was mocking me. For a movie that starts out with such a kick to the gut in terms of gritty, gutter level realism, for it to end on such a completely phony level, I can't help but feel Boyle pulled the wool over everyone's eyes. Perhaps that's the point.It's no secret SM is a fairy tale, furthermore, much of it is lifted right out of the pages of Dickins' Oliver Twist. The film also references Puccini's Tosca, a three-act opera considered by many to be the most dramatic of all operas. Since Boyle unabashedly acknowledges SM's operatic and dramatic origins, then perhaps his fault is his ambition. His ambition is to turn a contrived melodrama into a social commentary, to thrust into the spotlight the issues of poverty, a developing India, the caste system, globalization and the injustices of capitalism. Big themes indeed, but Boyle is not Brecht and there's nothing post-modern about SM's shamefully manipulative attempt to hide behind realism. I might be the only critic on the web to dislike this movie...but at least I know why.",Slumdog Millionaire
241,jonnyfendi,The Question About Life is Answered!,8,17 April 2010,"Danny Boyle is one of my favorite Directors of all-time. His films always reflect adventure and humanity. In his latest feature ""Slumdog Millionaire"", Boyle accomplishes the best work of his career. The movie tells about a story of a boy who cruising the rough life in India. As we know, the poverty has been one of the essential problems in the third-world like India. Thiz picture has won 8 Oscars, including prime categories in Best Picture, Director, and Adapted Screenplay. Its Begins at present time, Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) has been taken into police custody, after he was accused of cheating in the game show ""Who Wants to be A Millionaire"". His knowledge to answer all the questions makes them curious. The adventure begins when Jamal tells the story of his life where all the events in his previous experiences lead him to the quiz answers. It starts from Jamal's childhood that tells how her mother died tragically in a riot. After that, young Jamal had to learn how to live in the street. He was accompanied by his brother Salim (Madhur Mittal) and a girl named Latika (Freida Pinto). Later we know that his motive to participate in thiz game show is to find Latika. The story adorn with friendship, betrayal and love. The plots in overall is not naive at all, it also reminds us that life is not always fair. The fact behind the movie-making is so ironic. Some of the Cast members still have to live in the slum, somewhere in Bombay. But they are having the full time education now. I heard that the movie makers wanted to keep the money in trusted fund, so when they turn the age of 16 or 17 they will get their full salary which is about 100.000 dollars each. I really comprehend the idea that the only way to win ""Who Wants to be A Millionaire"" is just like the story in thiz movie.

It is an amazing portrait of today's India, a poor country becoming one of the top players in the global economy. It is the Rebirth of a Nation: I am not afraid to remind the names of Griffith and Eisenstein in the context of this movie. Well, the difference here is that the rebirth of the nation is done through individuals acting on their own: millions of individuals struggling with extreme poverty, with corruption, with criminality, with a police that is brutal while stupid, finding support only in themselves, in their ambition and stamina, in their power to believe in ideals.

Everything about this movie is a winner from start to finish. You really get involved with Jamal Malik's struggle from the depths of poverty (shown in one of its purest forms) to a life of love and riches. The cinematography is outstanding, showing many sights of India's metropolitan and historic landscapes making it a country I wound't mind seeing at one point in my life. The narrative really pulls you in, a way not unlike how English author Charles Dickens managed in his works. You really feel for the three main characters as their stories are fleshed out and bring a lot of emotion, you wonder how they are going to get out of each scenario. I won't reveal the ending, but I will say that this movie will keep you coming back again and again for years to come.

244,basilisksamuk,Having Your Cake and Eating it Too,3,28 February 2010,"I’ve never read the book on which this is based but my main reaction to the film was that it would have been vastly improved by removing all the sections based around Millionaire and just telling the story straight. Oh, that and all the main characters should have died in a hail of bullets in the final scene. It just doesn’t work as a film in any coherent way. I imagine the meeting where the film is first pitched – “It’s about the poverty of Indian children who live in the slums and how they have miserable and exploited lives – no wait, the high concept is that we can make it a feelgood movie with a happy ending and some Bollywood music and dance.” In the end we have film in which the poverty and misery is made to look chic by the way it’s shot and musically scored underpinned by all the usual Hollywood clichés. The result is something that people who really don’t care about movies can think is arty and of course it’s perfect Oscar fodder. It’s exotic, it’s abroad, it’s a bit harrowing but not too much, it has a happy ending. (Goodness knows what kind of sheltered lives some of the critics on IMDb have led if they think the violence and poverty shown here is too horrific for their weak constitutions. The problem is that it’s not real enough). I like fantasy. I like realism. On the whole I don’t think they mix well. (Pan’s Labyrinth being another example where the mixture really doesn’t work.)

245,fablesofthereconstru-1,Slumdog atheist,9,16 December 2008,"Jamal saw her first. Latika just showed up one day near the familial home like a hungry cat, a very wet cat. As the hard rain poured down on her, the young boy, grieving along with his older brother Salim over their dead mother, had the presence of mind to invite the drenched girl inside his house, and heart. As adults, Salim became a Muslim, but not Jamal, not after seeing his mother cut down by a mob of Muslim-hating Hindis. If Jamal became a Muslim, the Islamic faith would only stand in his way. Praise Latika, not Allah. To a self-righteous man, Latika is damaged goods. Sold into prostitution, the girl's formative years were spent in the company of men; she even slept with Salim. From Jamal's point of view, Latika is neither pure nor impure; no label of virgin nor whore to define her in patriarchal terms; no stigma. Since Jamal is godless, the harsh Islamic laws which subjugate women goes unacknowledged by the young man. To his religious older brother, her womanhood is spoiled; that's why Salim has no reservations about sleeping with Latika after they save her from prostitution; that's why he throws her back into sex slavery once he spends himself.Jamal loses her. He also severs the family line, and loses him.Jamal hatches a plan to get Latika's attention by appearing on ""Who Wants to be a Milionaire?"" The popular game show plays in the background during Jamal's reunion with Latika, who lives with a crime boss, Salim's employer. This mercenary finds cricket more interesting than the woman. Structured through a series of flashbacks, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" shows how Jamal acquires the basis for answering the host's questions, all of which are things that he knows. In one such sequence, the contestant remembers seeing the man who's the career leader in goals on Salim's employer's television screen. The correct answer is good for one million rupees. ""Slumdog Millionaire"" recalls an episode of the defunct NBC sitcom ""Cheers"", where Cliff Clavin, the erudite know-it-all mailman, makes an appearance on ""Jeopardy"" and has the good fortune of encountering categories that play into his wheelhouse(""Civil Servants"", ""Stamps Around the World"", ""Celibacy""). Since the questions being read by the show's host drives the narrative, some may argue that ""Slumdog Millionaire"" it much too paradigmatic for its own good: each Q & A composite just happens to push the story forward in linear fashion. While the story itself is formulaic, what we see while the story unravels; a privileged peek into the hard-luck lives of Mumbai Indians, more than offsets the inorganic plotting.To answer the final question, Jamal uses his lifeline. No other person for an Indian man is more important than his own brother. But that lifeline was cut long ago when Salim had sex with the fair figure of his idealized love. Instead, Latika becomes Salim's surrogate, which makes ""Slumdog Millionaire"" recognizable to a western audience, because in Islamic culture, men do not lean on women for support. On the matter of the question about the all-time scoring leader in cricket, the host tries to give Jamal the wrong answer, which cements our topsy-turvy feelings of defamiliarization we get from seeing an American institution being transferred to a foreign culture that his differing social norms. The host's attempt to railroad Jamal is a far cry from Robert Redford ""Quiz Show"", in which the producers of the game show ""21"" supplies Charles Van Doren(Ralph Fiennes) with the right answers. No god can tear this love apart. No god can debase Latika in Jamal's eyes. Love and money, not love of money, or a god, is what's important to these fated lovers when their lips, at long last, press together, outside the jurisdiction of the warring religions. ""Slumdog Millionaire"" quietly preaches secularism in a country where religion weighs heavily on its people.",Slumdog Millionaire

248,howie73,Slumdog is seriously overrated,5,15 June 2009,"Now the Oscar dust has settled, what remains of Slumdog Millionaire? Nothing much. Slumdog was a victim of its own buzz and the hype that surrounded it was, naturally, unsustainable. Watching the film on DVD, I was aware of its severe limitations as a cinematic experience. Originally intended for a DVD/TV crossover, the film very much belongs to that genre. The biggest problem of the film is its adult protagonist played by Dev Patel. For UK viewers, he is best known as one of the ex-cast members of the overrated teen drama Skins, and it's this TV baggage he brings to Slumdog. Furthermore, he is not the charismatic hero of Bollywood film but very average looking and limited in his acting talents. His co-star Freida Pinto as the adult Latika doesn't have to do much except look beautiful, and she does that very well. Embarrassingly, both are upstaged by the trio of child actors who bring a daring self-effacement to their roles. Is is they who bring a haunting authenticity to the film, being slumdog children themselves; and it's this blurring of roles and reality that is so intriguing.Why is it overrated? The film's central conceit of the Millionaire quiz and flashbacks is clever at the start but soon loses its effect. Director Danny Boyle is confused about where to reveal the origin of the answer – sometimes it's revealed after the question is asked; other times it's revealed before. There's an inconsistency about the flow of this narrative strategy and often I found myself guessing the outcome before it came and I don't want to be in this situation in a film. The film's dynamic flow staggers midway and the linear narrative takes hold. What we get is a run-of-the mill Bollywood romance that seems too Hollywood for its own sake. The final scenes are desperately out of place in the film and seem insulting to the audience following many harrowing scenes. To say the film's ending is badly handled is an understatement. Boyle seems to have been confused about how to end the film, so what we get is an abrupt cutaway to the protagonist Jamal, sitting like a beggar in the station despite being the most famous TV star in Mumbai. Just didn't ring true. The Bollywood credits further reinforces the trivial tone. No wonder it won so many Oscars!",Slumdog Millionaire
249,eastbergholt2002,Enjoyable Movie,9,24 December 2008,"I really enjoyed Slumdog Millionaire it is one of my favorite movies of 2008. The story is well told and although you occasionally plumb emotional depths the film is not depressing. Danny Boyle directs the film brilliantly. The camera work and editing are very slick are make for a fast paced and visually stimulating movie.Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) serves coffee to call center workers in Mumbai. The film contains flashbacks to his awful childhood as a parent-less Indian street urchin. His life is precarious and he encounters a collection Dickensian grotesques. Despite his misfortunes Jamal remains positive and optimistic,which makes you care about his life will turn out. There are many humorous scenes which lighten the mood. The story unravels like a Dickensian epic and by the end of the film you are glad you invested the time. Having spent a lot of time traveling around India, but mostly staying at expensive hotels, I almost recognize the main characters in this film. Anytime I went out alone as a well dressed foreigner I was approached by street people, who wanted my money. At the time, the lack of personal space was an annoying intrusion, but this film provides a fascinating insight into the lives of Indian street people, and why hey are so persistent. Highly recommended.",Slumdog Millionaire
250,ciscokid1970,Not bad...but,7,28 September 2009,"This movie was OK. I rented it and sat down with my wife to watch it. The story is very depressing for 90% of it, shows a lot of poverty and cruelty of living poor in India. The story basically centers around Jamal who some strange way gets on the show Who want's to be a millionaire in India. Quickly goes into some strange interrogation where he starts to tell the story of love, happiness, tragedy and some joy. The movie benefited by not having the dance scenes and song scenes in the middle of the movie (as most typical Bollywood movies). Yeah Hollywood gave a lot of Oscars to this movie. I think it was in hope of ""making happy a new market"" close to Bill people. The story was OK but not solid enough to be in the Best Screenplay category (Frost Nixon was still better). Got Oscar for sound and music (Walle should have won both). Just my opinion but this movie does not deserve to be in top 250 of all time.I still enjoyed Monsoon Wedding much more as a example of good India film-making.",Slumdog Millionaire
251,marissas75,Works better as an India travelogue than as inspiring drama,7,1 January 2009,"""Slumdog Millionaire"" uses a clever narrative strategy to tell the life story of Jamal Malik, an 18-year-old former slum kid, and at first, that was one of the things I liked best about the movie. When Jamal wins ten million rupees on ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"", the police don't believe he could have done it without cheating, so he must explain how he came to know the answers. Cue a series of flashbacks of Jamal's life, each of them incorporating the answer to one of the game show questions. It's an innovative way to tell a story, and the flashbacks are all exciting and dramatic. Jamal has confronted murderous religious mobs, sinister orphanage-keepers, and tough modern gangsters in his young life.But the suspense disappears somewhat when you realize that no matter how much filth and poverty Jamal encounters, no matter how many villains pursue him, he will survive to appear on the game show. Furthermore, it becomes increasingly clear that Jamal's story is a fairy tale, and that destiny is going to work in mysterious but positive ways to make sure that everything turns out all right.Thus ""Slumdog Millionaire"" works better as a tour of modern India than as a story about Jamal Malik. There is a terrific montage sequence set on a train, an interlude at the Taj Mahal, and some thought-provoking scenes of the gentrification of Mumbai. Meanwhile, the movie also gives an un-sugarcoated look at some of India's major social ills: religious conflict, extreme poverty, and prostitution/exploitation. Danny Boyle manages to fit this all together by directing everything in an exuberant, colorful, quick-cutting style. Even the subtitles are playful and color-tinted! (Most of the film is in English, except for the scenes where Jamal is a very small child and speaks Hindi.) Dev Patel, who plays Jamal at 18, has an open, innocent face and frequently seems a little out of his depth. This quality is useful during the game-show scenes, when Jamal is in the hot seat and dazed by his own success. But he otherwise seems like a nice suburban kid: someone who witnessed the horrors that the younger Jamal has seen should be both grittier and more soulful. The same goes for Freida Pinto, who plays Jamal's love interest Latika: she is a very pretty young woman but hard to believe as a former street waif. Additionally, Latika is not given much of a personality, which makes the love story hard to really cheer for.Ultimately, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" failed to move me, despite how hard it tried to do so. The flashy cinematography and propulsive action made the movie fun to watch, but also made it difficult to connect emotionally with the characters. And although the movie is meant to be the inspiring story of an underdog who triumphs, it makes clear that Jamal succeeds because destiny has chosen to smile upon him. He's a good-hearted and sympathetic boy, but a passive character in his own life. ""Slumdog Millionaire"" wants us to think ""It's OK that Jamal suffered all these hardships, because it enabled him to win millions of rupees and the girl of his dreams,"" but what about all the other Indian slum kids who suffer with no hope of relief, whom Fate has not chosen to favor?",Slumdog Millionaire
252,ween-3,Open the Bombay Doors,9,14 April 2009,"So this is how you ""curry"" favor with the Oscar and Globes voters. While ""Slumdog"" is, at its core, a happy ending love story, the urban sprawl of Mumbai and the unique manner in which the story unfolds set it apart. Danny Boyle and company have been duly rewarded for their originality and this is one of those instances where all the hype is absolutely merited. Couple of quick shout-outs here: 1) ""The Kids Are Alright""---the child actors in this film are fantastic and worth the price of admission on their own 2)Get yer Bollywood on---that full-on cast-of-thousands dance sequence that runs over the end credits is a great way to wrap things up.

253,blackburnj-1,"""The truth alone triumphs"": Danny Boyle's latest is a joy to behold",9,9 January 2009,"Danny Boyle's latest film, ""Slumdog Millionaire"", is hardly an obvious candidate for mainstream success. It is set in the slums of Mumbai, has scenes of torture and violence and is in Hindi for a third of the film. However, it has been nominated for a mountain of awards, is riding high in internet rankings and is doing well at the box office. When one takes a closer look, it isn't surprising that this film is doing as well as it is. It is a gripping, entertaining and ultimately wonderful piece of cinema.The story, which is about a young man who goes on ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"", is utterly simple. He has, unbelievably, reached the final question. He is arrested between broadcasts on suspicion of cheating his way to the top. However, the fact of the matter is that he just happens to know every answer. As he explains why, his tough and unforgiving past opens up, raising questions about why he's on the show in the first place.This film works because of the flashbacks which tell the story of a boy, his brother and a girl. It is not always an easy watch but moments of nastiness are rare, necessary and short-lived. As the story develops, Boyle's brilliance as a filmmaker pours off the screen. The raw, kinetic energy that he used to the maximum effect in ""Trainspotting"" is always apparent. The numerous sequences set in the slums are mesmerising to watch, accompanied by a magnificent score by A.R. Rahman, and vibrant photography from Anthony Dod Mantle.Boyle also makes sure that this film is more than a ""nuts-and-bolts"" feel good story. The central romance is beautifully done and all of his characters are brilliantly sketched and excellently well performed. Dev Patel (in the lead) is a magnificent screen presence and really impresses in his film debut, whilst the supporting performances of Anil Kapoor as the host of the show and Irrfan Khan as the sceptical police inspector are superb. Boyle has also managed to find some brilliant child actors who inject the film with yet more energy.Boyle also has a lot going on underneath. Like many great films, the location lives and breathes in the film. Mumbai, mirroring our characters, transforms through the film (for the better and for the worse). There is also a great deal about truth and integrity, neatly summed up in one of the answers. What is India's national motto? The truth alone triumphs.Although there is a slight drop in pace in the film about an hour in, this is really gripping, really entertaining and thoroughly enjoyable cinema. Despite the darker moments, this is a feel good movie which, in the present climate, will be taken to people's hearts. The real joy is that this good natured and excellent film deserves every piece of success it receives.5 Stars out of 5",Slumdog Millionaire

256,butchfilms,Overrated movie,1,20 February 2009,"I really don't understand why this film is so appreciated, OK it has a very strong love message and its beginning is very good but it decreases its quality each time the plot advances until the end. I think this film deserves 6.5 stars, but I give it 1 because it shouldn't be at the 250 top IMDb.The movie is divided in 3 parts: 1)when the leading characters are little children, 2) when they are young teenagers and 3) when they are old teenagers. The first part is great, the second part is entertaining but a little silly, and the third part looks like a bad movie, except by the last kissing scene which is very good and touching. If I had to rate the 3 parts it would be like this: part 1: 8 stars; part 2: 6 stars; part 3: 4.5 stars. Ah by the way I liked the final dance at the end.I didn't buy the circumstances under which the leading is questioned by the police by the suspicion he had cheated in the contest. I bought the parts where he knew the contest's answers (I liked the way they made it how he knew the answers) because we have always watched on the news about very rare good things that happen to people. As I said before the third part is very bad developed specially the scenes involving the under world of the Salim character.Jamal is a contestant of a TV program who is being questioning by the police by the suspicion he has been cheating. Jamal tells the police how the contest's answers are related with some facts of his life since he was a poor kid, and that he only wants to recover the love of his life by being part of this TV contest............I recommend watching this movie with your family especially because the children actors are very good.",Slumdog Millionaire
257,axismladen,Good movie but is it overrated!?!?,9,26 February 2009,"Slumdog millionaire surprised me in every aspect.It's a really good movie.Very enjoyable and interesting!The crew is good,the directing is great,music is great,the screenplay is great and the story is original.There is one more thing i was very surprised by in this movie an that's cinematography.There are only few flaw's in this film but they are not relevant so i'm just gonna say one that is.That flaw is that the movie is forgettable.Even though it won eight Oscar's i don't think it will be remembered in fifteen year's from now.It's personality is just not as strong as it's technical aspect's and the movie it self.I don't know,maybe i'm wrong but i just don't think that it will be remembered and called a classic one day.For example when someone mention's Gone with the wind or Dances with wolves or Braveheart or Gladiator or Forrest Gump or Clockwork Orange,i instantly remember every part of them and i remember those strong scenes and dialog's that on some way marked the history of film industry.And that's something that i don't see in this one.When someone says to me that some movie doesn't deserves the Oscar's it got i always say to that person that you have to look at it competition.If the competition wasn't very good then he deserved them.That's why i think that this movie deserved the Oscar's it got because it's competition wasn't that hard.Well,actually on the second thought i think that there are two movies better then this one this year an those are The Wrestler and The Dark Knight.So i think that it didn't deserve the Best Picture Oscar.But when i think again those two movies weren't nominated for Best Picture so it did after all.Just one more thing i have to say an that's not about this movie.It's about the Wrestler on which i already wrote a comment an i don't want to change it so i'm just gonna write it here.I think that it's shameful that Mickey Rourke didn't get the Best Actor in a Leading Role Oscar.Don't get me wrong Sean Penn was great in Milk but he wasn't even close to Mickey.He gave one of the best performances ever in the Wrestler and i think that 'Academy' should be ashamed of it self.Anyway,to come back to Slumdog Millionaire,it's a great movie that's definitely worth seeing but it's also a movie that definitely doesn't deserves a 38'th place on IMDb's 250 list.",Slumdog Millionaire
258,Ron Plasma,The Colour Of Money,6,13 January 2009,"We have long known that the worst toilet in the world is in Scotland; Trainspotting's Edinburgh for Danny Boyle, but the Glen Affric bothy for us adventurers. So the early ""humour"" of a small child jumping into a sea of (word censored by authoritarian IMDb)somehow boded well for what was billed as a feel-good movie. Even when you are, literally, in it deep, you can still crawl your way out.But I'm afraid I saw in Slumdog Millionaire too much that could not be soaped off: Torture; child abuse; mutilation. Come on? Not nice.I'll probably change my mind over time, but such horrors burnt my own retina to such an extent that the  once again literal  riot of movement and colour didn't compensate. A good film, but as far as I was concerned the ""feel-good"" was limited to the 'Millionaire' scenes that Celador present us with every week.Two final points at opposite ends of my muddled mind: I've seen Freida Pinto described as the great beauty of 2009  but wasn't she Candice in Corrie a few years ago? Four days before watching ""Slumdog"" I learnt the word ""crore"" from Raju's resignation letter. I don't have ""dedication"" rights, but I wish all Satyam innocents well in these astonishing times.One more. One more.

259,Monotreme02,"Unique and beautiful; more dark and gritty than ""feel-good""",8,9 January 2009,"Boyle's previous films are all fast-paced and energetic, and Slumdog Millionaire is an incredibly, frantically energetic film. From its opening interrogation scene, the film grabs a hold and never lets go. The exceptionally potent screenplay by Simon Beaufoy creates profuse quantities of tension and excitement, combining three parallel story lines  the interrogation following the game show, all of the events in the protagonist's life leading up to the game show, and the game show itself  and bounding between them frequently, constructing a fragmented chronology that only steps up the tension. Combine that with the natural tension of a trivia game show such as ""Who Wants to Be A Millionaire?"", and we end up with an irresistible brisk, energetic film.Boyle goes all-out with his cinematography; Anthony Dod Mantle combines a wondrous, exciting amalgamation of angles, focal lengths, camera movements (mainly hand-held), wide lenses and lighting set-ups to showcase and emphasize the natural energy and liveliness of the Mumbai slums where the film takes place. In fact, all of the technical elements of the film come together to create an astonishing palette of life and atmosphere, from the naturalistic costume and set design to the delightfully eclectic musical score by A.R. Rahman featuring a modernistic combination of pop songs, electronica and traditional Indian music. Getting all of these elements to come together and complement one another is a difficult enough task; but with the on-location shoot in the slums of Mumbai and other Indian shooting locations, Boyle's task is made even more difficult. It is an incredible directorial feat to undertake, and that's before counting in the local, non-actor, child cast members who deliver their lines in Hindu, when Boyle himself is English and doesn't speak English. The language barrier is broken and Boyle coaxes out of his cast members, both local and internationally known, wonderful and subtle performances that further reinforces his directorial achievement.Many people have been hailing it as ""this year's Little Miss Sunshine and Juno"", the ""little, feel-good indie film that could"", but Slumdog Millionaire reminded me mostly of the 2002 Fernando Meirelles-directed Brazilian film, City of God. Both films are substantially darker and grittier than any American feel-good indie comedic-drama, and both create a gloomy, coarse portrait of the hardships of local life in the slums, City of God portraying the slums of Rio de Janiero, and Slumdog Millionaire focusing on the slums of Mumbai. It's a daily struggle to survive, and people live in the harshest of conditions; but while the exoticness and apparent difficulty of these lifestyles may throw the average viewer off, the incredible thing is that the people who live in these places aren't only used to them, but seem to embrace them and find the good in situations that seem to the average viewer impossible to live in. Going further, both City of God and Slumdog Millionaire feature two characters whose maturity develops in parallel, with one going down the straight path while the other gets desperately involved in a life of crime, the only outlet for many in the slums. In the former film, these are two childhood friends; in the latter, brothers.That said, there is one significant point in which the films differ: While Slumdog Millionaire frames its story and characters with a melodramatic plot of hopelessly epic romantic love that transcends the ages, City of God portrays its characters and story with a far more realistic approach. The love story on display in Slumdog Millionaire is romantic and feel-good, but it lacks that realistic, naturalistic punch that City of God carries with it, and ends up preventing the film from reaching the true greatness of its Brazilian counterpart.Many have been hailing Slumdog Millionaire as the ""feel-good film of the year"". But in fact, it is far from it: While its final message may be heartwarming and uplifting, most of the film shows us a dark, gritty portrayal of people in our modern world living in the most difficult of circumstances. The exotic depiction of the ""real India"" as it is referred to in the film is unique and beautiful; frightening and magical; energetic and lively while at the same time shocking and mesmerizing. Boyle gives this depiction an unprecedentedly skillful portrayal, featuring energetic cinematography and featuring wonderful performances from a very diverse cast, many of whom are local non-actors delivering lines in Hindu. And screenwriter Simon Beaufoy has framed this depiction with a wonderful story of a young slumdog winning the grand prize while playing on the ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" television game show program, his knowledge of the answers to the questions deriving from his various, colourful experiences as a young man growing up in the harshest circumstances Mumbai has to offer.",Slumdog Millionaire

261,joshuafagan-64214,One of the Best Films of the Decade,10,2 September 2015,"I can't be the only one who finds it a bit odd that both this and Gandhi, the two best movies about India, were both made by Brits.Never matter. The best movies about a country don't have to be the ones made in that country. It helps, but the only people who would believe it to be a necessity are hardcore jingoistic patriots, a group with which I've had to many negative experiences to care about their opinions.Many of the best movies made about the fifties were not made during the fifties, as people were unwilling to show an objective view of what their lives were like during that decade. Likewise, many of the best movies made about country X or Y were made outside the country, both because foreign filmmakers are more skillful and because other countries can more openly dissect another without worrying about too many layers of politics. Personally, I would love to see a no frills British film about my country. Outsiders do have objectivity on their side.And this is a good portrait on India. It is decidedly not an Indian film, but it has no trouble diving into the issues of religion, poverty, change, and violence which cover the country. Some of my favorite films are the ones which educate without going out of their way to be educational. This movie fits the bill.It is long but it never feels like a drag. It is a sprawling epic that goes across the decades and entire regions of what is one of the most complex countries in the world. It is a visually striking film, one that unblinkingly shows heaps of trash and filth and even kids being intentionally harmed to make them more effective beggars.It never lets itself get too dark because people naturally don't let life get too dark. We are balanced creatures, always wanting to find light in dark and dark in light. There are too many people who live in dark cynicism or forced cheer and don't realize that. This movie doesn't let you forget it.And it is this balance and the feeling of realism that comes from it that keeps you on the edge of your seat. With a helping hand from a tight but unrestrained script, of course. When I'm searching through my memory banks, I often come across an image or clip that makes me question where it came from. Often, I realize, ""Oh, yeah, that's from Slumdog Millionaire."" It made a distinct impression on me. The unusual frame work of the gameshow is less a gimmick and more a golden road into a kingdom.The acting is superb. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that the lead actor would have become a star if he hadn't ruined his career by starring in the disgusting adaptation of my favorite cartoon. I feel for him.There is no question in my mind that this film deserves the boatload of Oscars it got. If I were to make a list of the five top films of the 2000s in terms of pure greatness, this would likely be on it.There is a scene in the late second act of the film that has stuck with me. Two of the main characters are sitting atop a building in construction, watching their old slums be turned into high rises. It is a complex moment, one that feels completely earned. And it is a moment that encapsulates the experience if watching this film.",Slumdog Millionaire

263,Willie-12,A Masterpiece,10,21 December 2008,"First, I want to say that I have waited two days to post this review. The reason I waited? I wanted to make sure that my feelings about this movie right after I saw it were genuine, and that I wasn't just caught up in the hype that surrounds this film. Slumdog Millionaire is a masterpiece, and quite simply one of the best movies I have seen in the last fifteen years. It is the ultimate story of hope and redemption, and it ends on a note so satisfying, that the only other movie I can even think of comparing it to (as far as satisfying endings are concerned) is The Shawshank Redemption. I don't know if Slumdog is as good as Shawshank, but I do know that it is pretty darn close. What's even more amazing is that I don't think I have ever heard of any of these actors, and yet all of them give powerful, compelling performances. Indeed, the only person's name I did recognize in the credits is Danny Boyle's. And what a movie Boyle has orchestrated here. It is my opinion that one could not ask for anything more from a movie than what is present in Slumdog. We have action, we have suspense, and we have loads of drama. There's tragedy, and there's triumph. It has a wonderfully written screenplay, and is edited in such a way that the pace of the film never slows down. I was so engrossed in this film, and the journey that is taken by the characters, that I honestly could not believe that I had sat in a theater for just over two hours. I know there will be naysayers here. But they will be few and far between. There will be cynics that complain about the unrealistic nature of the ""coincidences,"" and there will be those who are unconvinced by the happy ending. But they will be a small minority. And they are entitled to their opinion. However, it is my opinion that if you love movies, and if you are looking for a powerful story about ordinary people surrounded by extraordinary circumstances, then you need to see this movie. Trust me. It is the type of cinematic experience that only comes around once in a great while.",Slumdog Millionaire
264,commandercool88,A fairytale story you will never forget.,10,20 December 2008,"'Slumdog Millionaire' is something of a miracle. In an industry where heartbreak and tragedy often rule out, here is a movie you can genuinely root for. One that hits all the right notes. Whatever you may take away from Danny Boyle's aesthetic journey through India, it will almost certainly leave you with a smile and sense of wonderment.Oddly enough, there isn't anything particularly groundbreaking about 'Slumdog Millionaire'. It is in many ways a traditional rags to riches story, but told with such freshness and endearment that everything you see on-screen is exciting and unpredictable. A bizarre story, told through the eyes of a young man competing on India's version of 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'. One question away from the million dollar question, our main character Jamal is arrested and accused of cheating. He has, as time will soon show, become a national hero. Because Jamal does not come from a privileged background. He is, in fact, an orphan who has not had a proper education since he was a young boy. But there is an amazing story intertwined, and it's as dazzling as it is unforgettable.To prove his honesty, Jamal traces his steps back to the very beginning. He tells the story of his life, weaving in every question asked on the show and applying it to a life lived without any shortcuts. From innocence to maturity, and a never ending search for one girl's affection. We're given access to a side of India rarely seen by outsiders, as beautiful as it is impoverished. There is such passion behind Boyle's direction, an English filmmaker who has given us a very diverse collection of films throughout the years, and he presents us with a picture that desperately seeks for truth and greatness. A vision that affirms life around every corner even when encountering the lowest of lows.'Slumdog Millionaire' is the right film at the right time. It's an underdog story we can all cheer for, and one that has the awesome potential to move an entire audience. The film's cast, many characters are played by multiple actors as the years pass, all come together to form something very special. Dev Patel in particular, who plays our present day Jamal, is a great young talent who delivers a fine performance. And from its dizzying but fantastic editing to breathtaking cinematography, 'Slumdog Millionaire' is everything you could ask for in a film and then some. Nothing I say could possibly give a film like this justice, you simply have to experience it for yourself and witness the power. 'Slumdog Millionaire' is about as good as they come. A fairytale story you will never forget.More reviews: rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public",Slumdog Millionaire

He does with fresh story-telling and simply with great style. The cast is young but they are so natural and talented. The story is raw and merciless. You cannot help yourself of thinking how happy my childhood has been comparing. It is wonderful that Boyle has decided to tell the story through children. They are the heroes in this movie. They deserve some respect! There is no question that why the movie has been so popular because it is different but people can easily relate to it because of the underdog situation. Boyle reflects the poverty and exploitation of children in Indian society to the influences of USA for instant. In addition there is the turmoil how can so young and uneducated man know so much? Why wouldn't he because he has probably been trough more than educated adults around the world.

Slumdog is a refreshing movie, one which I for one hope will open the gates of Bollywood to the Western world, if it hasn't already. It shows the character of Mumbai, the heart of India, the financial hub. Starting from the communal riots to the life of poverty that is led by the homeless. The cruelty inflicted on them, the inhumanity makes your heart go out. The scene where young Jamal gets kicked in the face by the cab driver when he sees that his cab has been ransacked, and Jamal says,""You wanted to see the real India, this is it!!"" What an ironic and true statement!!This movie apparently has all the qualities of a typical Bollywood flick, but yet so different. Firstly the excellent screenplay and casting of characters. The sequence of young Jamal explaining to the American couple about the Taj Mahal was hilarious. Also the scene when the evil Maman gouges the eye out of a boy, so that he can earn more,just because he has a special talent in singing.(Trust me folks, such things happen, and even more worse things too) You can shudder at the gore, and your heart will go out when a grown up Jamal sees him later and gives him the 100$ because he wants to, makes your heart go out to the poor kid.The casting, I felt was brilliant. Right from the young Jamal and Salim to the middle-aged Jamal and Salim, it was absolutely awesome, and Danny Boyle got the best out of both the actors. Of course Dev Patel, himself was brilliant as well, so was Anil Kapoor as the shrewd, evil host of the show. The film also has its bit for the Western Audience, and the ones who don't understand Hindi, in an innovative way of putting in subtitles. The music, is also too good. A.R. Rahman does it again, like he has done so many times, and an Oscar nod may be on its way, it was a long time coming. Not going to harp on the story, since the trailer pretty much gives you an idea about it. But I'll just sign off saying Kudos to Danny Boyle and the ""Slumdog Millionaire"" team for this wonderful movie.",Slumdog Millionaire
267,valen060,Danny Boyle's Work: Captivating and Motivating,10,28 September 2015,"When I first heard of this movie back when it was still new to theaters, it was thanks to my film professor at my local university that introduced it to me. After witnessing the entire story unfold, it felt so uplifting and provided an insight on India's slums. Stars Dev Patel (in his breakout film role) and Frieda Pinto certainly gave splendid performances as characters Jamal and Latika respectively. After watching director Danny Boyle's previous movie 28 Days Later, this is quite a transition from one genre to another. What both the latter and this movie have in common is that it aims towards main characters who are trying to find a purpose for themselves on their imperfect lives, but not without getting thrown into conflict with people they remain unsure if they should trust them or not, thus shaping their lives in various ways.As the story goes, an impoverished individual named Jamal who pretty much grew up in the slums of India with his older brother Salim tries to make a living in surviving any means necessary, even if it means tangling with the wrong crowd. Despite the hardships, betrayal, and the various conflicts along the way, Jamal tries to make something for himself by entering into the game show ""Who Wants to Be A Millionaire?""Observing the technical portions, I liked how well the film editing tells the story through Jamal's perspective and that the past experiences he went through lead up to the present time back and forth frequently, which helped him achieve the answers he seeks during the game. It's basically fate telling the story through the questions he is given by the host. For it to win eight Oscars that year, I can already see what makes it so significant. The music and underscore of composer A.R. Rahman also had me so immersed into the dramatic settings of the film that I was entranced by how well it accompanied tense situations and enlightened moments. After looking back at this movie several years later, it's certainly not overrated, it is indeed written.",Slumdog Millionaire
268,midas-jacobs,"Didn't deserve all of these Oscars, but that doesn't mean that it isn't a good one!",8,19 June 2016,"Last night I saw ""Slumdog Millionair"", so here is my review for it.Lets start with a little synopsis of the movie. The movie is about Jamal. We see his live, but also see bits of how he won the TV-show, due to an interrogation. Did he cheat? Didn't he? Did he win the maximum prize?This movie was directed by the wonderful director Danny Boyle, but this time he got some help of Loveleen Tandan. I believe she directed the bits that were filmed in India. I've seen another film of Boyle called ""127 hours"" a fantastic movie, with a special style to it. Boyel transferred that style to this movie as well. It was recognizable and I like when this is there Christopher Nolan too has a recognizable, and Quentin Tarrantino as well. Boyle used some very pretty and impressive aerial shots, where I sometimes thought that Cg was involved, but that it just wasn't noticeable. The directing wasn't of course the only good thing about the directing. The cinematography was also on point. But this is of course also thanks to the wonderful directing. There was this cliché shot, but this worked in the movie. The shot is when little Jamal and his brother are being followed by the police. This was pretty early on in the movie. Now that were the technical visual aspects of the movie. An audible aspect was the soundtrack. This was a very good part of the movie. It fitted the overall theme, but also the moments in the movie. The sound effects were also very good. Another thing that I really liked was the editing. It was done very good, without any mistakes that I could spot. But thanks to this editing the pacing was also very good.The acting as well was very good. The main character was played by I believe 3 actors. The adult version and the kid version of him. Jamal, the protagonist, was played by Dev Patel. This is the first good movie that I've seen of him. But that isn't a big surprise because the only other movie that I've seen of him is ""That Last Airbender"". In that movie he over-acted, but in this movie though, he was very good. He did the emotional lines very good, and nailed the funny lines. Actually, all of his line delivery was very good. The kid versions were also very good. They were the most surprising, all of them. For their age it was very impressive. His counterpart for most of the movie was his brother. He too was good. The adult version was less good than the kid actors. The actress of Latika was also very good. The antagonists of the movie were the presenter and Prem. Prem was played by someone who also acted in ""The Last Airbender"" This was Anil Kapoor. He too was good. And the presenter was also very good. With every time Jamal won something you could see the hate in his face, even though he was smiling.The script is something that I'm not so sure about. It had its good parts but also some bad ones. Let's start with the story overall. This was good. It was told in a creative way, with a bit of a ""Usual Suspects"" vibe. I was expecting a twist at the end of the movie, but there wasn't one. Like I just said, the story overall was good, but some bits weren't. Like the scene where he crawled through sh*t. This was for me more of a part to amuse the kids that ended up watching the movie for some reason. This was dull. Another little problem I have with the movie is the conveniences. That it was all to convenient that exactly those things happened in his life that were asked, and that's why I started to speculate that it would go full ""Usual Suspects"" I'm glad that they didn't, because that would've ruined the whole movie. There was also some good humor in the movie. The fat help cop had some funny one-liners and so did Jamal. No that I have that out of the way. How were the characters? very good. That's my answer to that question. Jamals and his brothers characters were well developed throughout the story by showing bits of their past. But due to the acting of Jamals actors I was more invested in his character than in his brothers. The character of Latika was good at moments, but annoying at moments too. Like in the last scene. When she was running to the car with the phone in it. This was rather frustrating, and she was useless at that moment too. You could argue that she was the motivation for Jamal, and I would like to discus that with you, because I think that she didn't have any influence to Jamal at that moment. The dialogue overall was also very good.Well, that was my review for this movie. I don't think that it deserved all of these Oscars, but it isn't a bad movie. It's still very good. That's why I give this movie an 8.3/10",Slumdog Millionaire
269,SimonHeide,Hardship in the slums of Bombay,7,1 March 2009,"We follow a young boy - Jamal - during a jeopardy competition. During this we see different highlights (or lowlights) of his life in either some scary flashbacks or through the interrogation that he undergoes in a police station. It must be considered common knowledge that children in development countries often suffer from hunger and abuse and the movie is a testament to that. It is a quality that the movie never becomes sentimental or tries to impose any feelings unto the viewer. What we see from the slum isn't meant to bring tears into our eyes - it is more a matter of telling us the story of the three musketeers Latika, Salim and Jamal.A basic premise in the movie is that Jamal has a destiny and that he believes that. This means that he never looses his faith during the competition and that he has a firm belief that he will eventually ""win"" Latika.Personally I found that the depiction of survival in the slums of Bombay played to big a part in the movie. It was stressful to watch Salim and Jamal fighting to stay alive and it could have been minized to add more progression in the story.A minor, unsatisfying detail was the host in the Jeopardy program. He was so sarcastic towards Jamal that he became unbelievable.I will most certainly recommend this movie; it deals with an important subject without becoming political or trying to impose feelings unto the audience.Regards SimonPs.

270,the-gossip-king,The best film of the year,10,20 December 2009,"2008 was wonderful year for film, unquestionably. All films nominated for an Oscar were more than deserving of the awards they were nominated for or won as well. I caught this film after it won best picture, having seen the other four best picture nominees. My front-runner was Stephen Daldry's small holocaust film 'The Reader' which I thought was incredible and didn't believe that Slumdog Millionaire could top that. Danny Boyle, the director, proved me wrong. This is easily the best film of the year followed by 'The Dark Knight' for its clever storytelling, colorful characters and completely heartfelt narrative. Technically it is brought to life beautifully, the cinematography is wonderful though I would have awarded Wally Pfister for 'The Dark Knight' in cinematography over this even though this film ended up taking the award. I would have also awarded 'the Dark Knight' editing and the sound award it wasn't given. But that said it is still beautiful to look at with wonderful colors that make the screen come alive. This isn't a story told simply but at the heart of its clever, complex story is indeed a simple love story mixed with a rags to riches tale. It is funny, moving and heartwarming with a brilliant mix of drama and politics. You must see this film.",Slumdog Millionaire
271,paulo20,I will NEVER believe the hype again...,4,8 February 2009,"Or never pay 11 bucks for it again, anyway. All I've heard was good things about this movie and assumed it would be $11 well spent. Well, so much for that.This movie is a ""boy meets girl"" fairy tale story, and I don't mean that in a good way. I know it's supposed to be uplifting and heartwarming but it rings hollow. It's based on nothing more than a gimmick. Seriously, this movie is about a series of improbable events and the rationale by which we're to believe it all is that it's destiny. And, the thing is, I'd buy into it if I could buy that the two characters (boy and girl) had any sort of chemistry. But they don't.To sum up as briefly as possible: boy meets girl (who, along with his brother, is orphaned at a young age), then boy loses girl. Luckily, some years later, boy finds girl again. But, since his brother is a dick, he loses girl again (he loses contact with his brother as well). Some years after that, he is able to find her again (as well as his brother), but things are complicated. She has somehow fallen in with the wrong crowd and is married to a gangster, who then whisks her away, so boy again loses girl. But he doesn't give up and gets the idea to go on the popular game show ""Who Wants to Me a Millionaire,"" which, he reasons, she'll be watching.He then goes on the show and answers all but the last question before the show's hour is over. He then ends up at the police station where he is roughly interrogated on suspicion of cheating. It is this point at which the movie starts, and we are then given the rest of the story alluded to above via flashbacks. That is the film's narrative device, to show each question and flashing back to the point where the boy got the answer (except for a few questions for which he uses his lifelines). Turns out, each answer was gotten in the same order as the questions on the show.As you can probably imagine, yes it's all HIGHLY improbable. ASTRONOMICALLY improbable even. But hey, it's DESTINY and the girl actually does come to watch the live broadcast of the game show and even ends up being one of his lifelines! (Although she doesn't know the answer  more on this later) Then they meet at an oddly empty train station, declare their love for each other and touch lips. Then they, and a bunch of mysteriously appearing other people, go into a funky Bollywood dance number over the end credits. YAY! Except not YAY! BOO! Again, I think I'd be willing to buy this fairy tale if the love angle between the boy and girl was in any way believable. But I didn't see it, feel it or believe it for a second. The characters barely had time to know each other. When the two first meet, they're about seven years old, i.e. a while before puberty, and together for a few days at best before they are separated. When they are reunited a few years lager, they are together for perhaps an even shorter time. When they meet still later, well the girl is hot, but the chemistry between the two still fails to come through, mostly because it's never adequately established before this. The fact that the two characters (as well as Salim) are played by three sets of actors (young, older, oldest) doesn't help. Thus the message of destiny ultimately falls flat.The movie even poses a multiple choice question asking how Jamal could have known the answers to the WWTBAM questions. Choice A was ""he cheated,"" choice D, ""it is written"" (I forget what the other two were). When I saw this, I had no idea that the answer would actually turn out to be D, ""it's written."" Yep, it's written alright. And do you know where it is written? In the script. I'm sorry to say, it really doesn't go any deeper than that.",Slumdog Millionaire

273,nagsaptarshi,There are thousands of Bollywood movies better than this.Then why SM?,6,4 July 2010,"First of all let me say that this movie brought Oscars for three Indians, AR Rahaman, Gulzar and Russel Pukutty.So there was a big reason for the Indian audience to cheer for Danny's team.But frankly speaking, the movie lacks substance as compared to many Hollywood films made in 2008 and also below par than many Bollywood flicks made every year.May be it was with this movie that Western audience got a touch of the flavor of Indian style of film making and Indian way of living.And for this it is a landmark movie in its own right.But then,winning 8 Oscars is a big deal, Isn't it and any Indian would say if that could win 8, what was wrong with the likes of Rang De Basanti,Taare Zameen Par or Lagaan? All of those beautiful movies earned a niche for themselves by their merit, which unfortunately SM could not achieve.I would never say it is a trash but then again its not a gem either. P.S: For those western audiences who think it deserved eight Oscars,I recommend a few Indian movies like the one I already mentioned + Chak De India,Parinda,Satya,Company,Shiva,Parzania,Black Friday,Swades,Ab Tak Chappan.The list will be too long to be accommodated here.So skip SM and go for the ones I recommended. The final thing, thanks to SM and Danny for at least bringing Indian style of film making to the western world, which is a wonderful achievement and deserves loads of accolades.",Slumdog Millionaire
274,petit76,great work! worth seeing!,8,8 April 2009,"There has already been some talk coming from Telluride that this film is set to be this year's 'Juno.' It does have the same distributor and it is set for the same release period, and for anyone who hears this buzz, they will definitely not be disappointed.During the premiere of the final cut (in the words of director Danny Boyle) at the Toronto International Film Festival, the audience gave the film an incredibly enthusiastic response, and it went on to win the People's Choice Award. Boyle, who is sometimes called a British Richard Linklater for yet again surprising the audience with such diverse subject matter, worked his magic. He transcended genres and created a truly unique and energetic picture.Just about every aspect of this film deserves merit, and above all it belongs to Boyle, who managed to assemble such a massive achievement. The score by A.R. Rahman, with contributions from M.I.A., perfectly accompanies the action on screen. Still, it is great enough to be listened to on its own. With India as a backdrop, Boyle and his cinematographer have composed some remarkable images. The acting is roundly impressive, especially coming from the younger cast, almost all of which has never acted before.The film begins as Jamal (Skins' Dev Patel) is under interrogation by Mumbai police for cheating on India's version of Who Wants To Be a Millionaire, being only one question away from winning it all. As the inspector says, even doctors and lawyers cannot come close to the 20m rupee prize, and so Jamal, having grown up on the streets of Mumbai, cannot possibly know these things. As Jamal tries to avoid further torture, he begins to explain to the police how he knew each of the answers. Flashbacks present Jamal's boyhood and explain how he got to the show.At the centre of his journey is his brother, Salim, and a girl, Latika, who is left a homeless orphan after an attack that took Jamal's mother as well. After running from a man who exploits the trio for labour, Jamal replays the incident when Latika left his life when she was unable to catch a moving train. His uncertainty of her fate on the streets of Mumbai and his intense desire to see his first and only love again lead him to the interrogation room where the film began.Like 'Juno,' Slumdog Millionaire is by genre a comedic drama, but it becomes much more. The film asks questions about fate, righteousness, greed, and even urban sprawl. Above all, however, it asks about love in the face of the most dire obstacles, and if it can truly prosper. Jamal's story is a tragic and unfortunate one, but as seen through his eyes, it is still beautiful. The vast colour palate of India overwhelm any negative feelings, and Jamal's hope of finding and being with Latika overwhelm despair. For Jamal, 20m rupees isn't his prize. It would be nearly impossible for there to be a better picture this year.Evren Buyruk from",Slumdog Millionaire

276,alexkolokotronis,City of God Has One Vital Thing Slumdog Millionaire Does Not,7,30 January 2009,"Slumdog Millionaire is one of the most critically acclaimed movies of 2008 but the hype surrounding it is a bit undeserved. Don't get me wrong, this is at the very least a good movie and is quite a terrific movie 2/3 the way through. What the movie does though in the last 1/3 is make the fatal mistake of turning into a Hollywood or maybe in this case a Bollywood movie. It takes away from that genuine and satisfying feeling. The acting all around was very good particularly from Dev Patel and the small kids. There performance are probably the only thing that is overlooked in this film. Without much of these very good performances the movie would not have been at the level it was at.The directing of Danny Boyle was his best yet. The look of the film was amazing and many screen shots of India were breathtaking. The musical score was very fitting to the style of the movie. It was one of the best scores of 2008. Where this film fell apart was at the writing. Towards the end its withdrew into a standard romance. It was no longer the great and amazing adventure we had witnessed for most of the movie. The complex relations seemed to be over simplified and it does the safe thing to do in the approach of tone but if taken into a drastically different direction could have lead it to be a real classic. Yet instead of ever peaking or sky rocketing to greatness it had plateaued and didn't deliver the way I had hoped it would, this largely in part by the failure of the screenplay.Many people have compared this film to City of God because the film are actually similar in many ways. Yet City of God has something Slumdog Millionaire does not have which is depth and character motivations. These things are vital to these kind of movies being successful. City of God seemed to have a more plausible story because the story was more linear. Events took place as a result of other events. This did not happen in Slumdog Millionaire, the story was more chopped up and too many of the events just seemed to pop up out of no where. Slumdog Millionaire did take a very ambitious approach in the way it was made which is commendable. Is this a 1st rate movie though? The answer to that is no.",Slumdog Millionaire

279,starlit-sky,the most overrated movie of the year,5,24 January 2009,"Slumdog Millionaire's premise is so cliché that I cannot believe the hype; it's the story of a poor boy in love with a girl and some bad guys in between them. I don't know how many movies I have seen with this exact same premise. There must be literally thousands of Asian, Mid-Eastern movies with exact same story. Many people here complain about insult to India as a country. How about insult to all the other great movies that have not been recognized by the Academy? How about the great Afghan, Iranian movies that are actually much smarter and original than Slumdog Millionaire but somehow never get to be seen by the American Audience? What about the insult to them? Slumdog Millionaire's commercial success solely depends upon the producers, and nothing more (and maybe due to the fact that most Americans are not familiar with this kind of story or maybe hungry for unrealistic, almost fairy-tale like love story, innocence kept through hard-times). There is not one original idea in the entire movie. I easily predicted everything before it happened, including the ending. No surprises, no clever screenplay, no great acting.... I guess the only cinematic achievement in the movie was the excellent photography. The sceneries from India's ghettos were just amazing in the sense of photographic quality. Lastly, Academy should be ashamed of nominating this movie as the best picture not to mention in many other categories. The Kite Runner, a far superior picture didn't get single nomination.

280,the_rattlesnake25,"""If you get the answer wrong Jamal, you lose everything.""",9,26 December 2008,"Danny Boyle is back behind the camera with a change of scenery and a story of one slumdog's rise from nothing to something in the blink of an eye on the Hindi version of 'Who Wants To Be Millionaire'. Nobody believes what is happening, not the presenter, nor the police, however as Jamal Malik continues to defy convention by getting question after question right, we are not only watching a potential millionaire in the works, but are also thrown into the distant journey of his past. With one question separating Jamal from an astounding 20 million rupees, one question remains; why is Jamal really on the show? 'Slumdog Millionaire' is a story of love, life, family, poverty and ultimately one man's rise from the foundations of dirt to the creation of gold through life itself. In a world where wealth can be won in an instant, it is only those who strive for the inspiration and delve into their own determined mind that can achieve this, which Jamal is, an underdog. And we all know how much we love to connect-to and adopt an underdog no matter whom, why or where he or she is.From the first scenes where we see Jamal being tortured in the Police Station as he is held in the same contempt as a common thief to the final suspense fuelled moment, Danny Boyle manages to tug on every heart string available to viewer all at a swift pace. From heart-warming entertaining scenes, such as when Jamal and his brother Salim pretend to be Taj Mahal tour guides to the foreign tourists, we are juggernauted and catapulted into the emotional opposite with Jamal constantly fighting the demons keeping him apart from the only girl that brings to a smile away. It is this constant emotional battle that keeps our eyes open and our mind ticking. Why? Because we simply want to know how Jamal got there and where he is now headed.Danny Boyle is almost flawless in his melodramatic direction of 'Slumdog'; he allows the film to build without ever dragging out a section of the film to the point where you wish Jamal would stop 'reminiscing'. However I mustn't overlook the other technical and stylistic aspects which allowed this film to flourish, most importantly Anthony Mandle's beautiful cinematography of the various contrasting lands of India and Chris Dickens smoothly worked editing guarantee that the brilliantly written script from Simon Beaufoy flows effortlessly into creating a wonderful modern fairytale that will by the end make you laugh, smile or cry, or all three.When I first heard Danny Boyle, the director of Trainspotting, 28 Days Later and Sunshine among others, was attached to direct a Romantic Drama set within the deep confines of Indian culture and society, I laughed. However it's Boyle who is having the last laugh, as he has created a chilling, yet warm, frightening, yet uplifting film that touches upon pretty much every human emotional response available, but will definitely leave you exiting the cinema with one feeling fresh in your mind and your gut; that you have seen something special.",Slumdog Millionaire

I suppose it still works as something of a modern fairytale, like Pretty Woman, and it definitely does have a couple of very good moments, but ultimately it was just impossible for me to take seriously such an exaggeratedly contrived story.After it ended, my fiancée said that she was half-expecting it to end with a Usual Suspects scene, in which the whole thing would be revealed to be an elaborate tale invented for a policeman's ears by a street-hardened conman; I would have found it to be a much better film if it had been that way, actually!",Slumdog Millionaire
282,vishaal811,A Grand Movie with an Unrealistic Story,7,8 July 2015,"Slumdog Millionaire focuses on a slumdog Jamal played by Dev Patel who happens to win the grand prize in the show 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?'. The movie is set in Mumbai and the director seems to have done quite some research which is evident by the final product. It manages to give us a glimpse of the harsh, brutal life that these people have to live. Despite the beautiful cinematography and visionary direction, there are quite a number of points in this movie that are completely unrealistic. First of all, poor people with limited education cannot speak perfect English, in fact, it is highly unlikely for them to even know a few English words. I guess most of the dialogs were in English to make the story accessible to a wider audience. The acting by everyone is quite credible including a number of untrained street kids who were highly believable in their roles.The Academy Award winning score by A.R. Rahman adds another dimension to this film and it manages to complement the tone of the movie perfectly.The movie was made for a global audience and the prime objective was to show the blatant exploitation of poor children by egregious, unconscentious people who force them to beg and do other abhorrent errands. It managed to win the Academy Award for Best Picture but it is unlikely to be loved by Indians due to how they show us in a poor light. All in all, this is a well directed romance that is in some ways like a typical Bollywood masala film. I would give it 7 stars due to my conflicting views on this movie.",Slumdog Millionaire

However, the game show host suspects the boy is cheating & has the police take him away for questioning.

So, as Mr. buttons is out of the race, slumdog wins it. No doubt it is a nice enjoyable movie but only for western or westernized minds.

It has three things going for it: 1) Freida Pinto is drop-dead gorgeous, 2) the ending 'music video' at the train station is fun and invigorating, and 3) Freida Pinto is drop-dead gorgeous. That's about it.From beginning to end, the story zig-zags around like a snake in a traffic jam. Sensible dialog is lacking much of the time, character development seems like an afterthought, and the film is often ploddingly slow and boring.The plight of the poor in Mumbai is a topic worth exploring, but Slumdog does a poor job of it. There is little depth to the storyline, aside from the outhouse scene. I have to admit -- that looked pretty deep to me!",Slumdog Millionaire
286,anupviswanath,Awe,3,26 January 2009,"I have seen this movie.Its an amazing movie that depicts life of the Metro city Mumbai,the slums,the people,the life and India.This films writer has done the best.But if this film was not directed by Danny Boyle it would never have reached to Oscar nominations for 10 categories.It might just become like Lagaan going after 1 Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Film.It was an awesome challenge by a foreign director to make a film based on Indian Slum.The story is remarkable and i sincerely thank all the people involved in this Great film from The Director,Producer,Music Composer,Writer etc to the light boys(i mean the whole crew) for bringing a joy of some sort to the Indians by canvasing this film into the world market.",Slumdog Millionaire
287,varundelpiero,It's even better than people say it is...,9,17 February 2009,"It is difficult to encapsulate SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE in any single comment/review, as it is a much too powerful Motion Picture to concisely summarise, blending together so many elements of human emotion and humanity, all done in a stylish manner characteristic of Danny Boyle. It is a film that begins with quite dark elements, leading the viewer to believe that it is a film noir, but as this excellent film progresses and unravels, the viewer slowly begins to understand the non-chronological plot.The basic premise of SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is Destiny, for those who choose to believe in such things. For it is only human to embrace the concept of Destiny; that someone is truly destined for something or someone else, and that the Universe tends to unfold as it should in order to facilitate such.The cast is impeccable, as even the younger unknown actors/actresses do incredibly well. Special note must be made about Dev Patel, who it seems was born to play the lead role. He is extremely likable (almost too likable, one might say) and it is inconceivable to think that any audience will be rooting against him. Anil Kapoor is also quite superb as the game-show host, bringing a sense of deceptiveness and deviousness to go along with his charm and personality. Freida Pinto also deserves credit for her part as the eldest Latika. In all, this is quite easily one of the best ensembles to grace the theatre in 2008, and is another compelling argument (for) that Best Ensemble should be added to the Academy Awards.The story is an engrossing and uplifting one, full of redemption and victory following struggle and hardship. It is perhaps one of the most inspirational films of the decade, and of all time.As of early February, much awards buzz has been surrounding Danny Boyle's masterpiece, and it is easy to understand why people gravitate towards this finely-constructed story. I will be posting this review well before the Academy Awards, but I am confident that this film will deservedly walk away with the Best Picture and Best Director awards, just to name a couple.Unreservedly recommended. 9/10. 4 stars (out of 4). Even on first viewing, this film should enter my Top 100 at 77.",Slumdog Millionaire
288,arnieiam,Overrated,1,12 January 2009,"Couple of things.This film perpetuates the western impression of India being a wasteland just filled with vice. Nobody cares that the nation has stepped up its game in so many ways.This movie was the white man's attempt to win an Oscar and that was it. It had no message. A movie like Boyz N The Hood did show a very gritty side of Los Angeles. However John Singleton, who is a native of South Central, wanted to show what he went through when he was a child. His message was clear. This movie is pure fiction. I strongly presume that the director did not grow up in Mumbai's shanty towns.Then comes the story. I heard that Salman Rushdie, a guy who is not welcome in India and who writes stories that make no sense at all, comment that SM's story did not make sense! The story was nothing spectacular, it's the same crap I watch in Hindi films.Overrated.Plus this has to be the most pretentious use of Dutch angles.",Slumdog Millionaire
289,thescholar22,Slumdog Millionaire Review,8,9 June 2015,"I remember watching this in a writing class back in 2009. I kinda knew what the mood of the movie would be like. Think I even heard this thing from ""Mind of Mencia"" where the says ""all 3rd world kids have in the world is being alive."". Wasn't until I saw this film it was sadly true but also made me appreciate what I have in the world. Basically it's about a Indian kid from the slums trying to win the million dollar prize on Indian version of Who Wants to be a Millionaire. This movie was also made made by the same Director that did 28 Days Later, Danny Boyle, and it really shows.It starts of with our hero Jamal's childhood all the way up to him being on the game show. I'm going to try not doing any spoilers since this is one of those movies that shouldn't be spoiled. Seeing Jamal and this brother go though all of this at such a young age shocked me and it still does. At the end it's pretty amazing and so true about good TV, movies, books, and even games maybe.My friend Don also mentioned this was kinda based on the 2002 movie City of God when I bought Slumdog Millionaire at a dollar store recently. Never really saw City of God probably because I was too young and it was an independent movie as well. Anyway Slumdog Millionaire is a classic with all of the Indian music and locations as well. Even kinda mocks the Hindu caste system a little in the game show scenes, at least I think. I recommend watching it when you can. It'll make you appreciate what you have in the world.",Slumdog Millionaire
290,dj_xand325,"Brutality, Corruption, Abhorrence, Drama and Romance intertwine in Boyle's magnificently directed glance into life in the slums of India",8,28 January 2009,"Slumdog Millionaire examines the life of Jamal Malik whose troubled background ranges from struggling to live in a Mumbai slum as a child to narrowly escaping murdering organ sellers. The basis lies in Jamal's stint as a contestant on Who Wants to be a Millionaire. He is one day away receiving the question worth the grand prize of 20 million rupees, yet Jamal's slumdog background rouses suspicion about how he is really getting these questions correct. A violent interrogation ensues in which Jamal explains how it was so that he answered all the questions correctly. From this, the film switches back and forth to Jamal's past which links masterfully to the questions asked. The editing was stunning; the story slowly reveals that Jamal isn't cheating, he is just experiencing some amazing luck! Stupid it may seem but this abstract concept is an expression of fate and destiny; yet this isn't a simple rags to riches story we have seen before.Boyle examines the cold, brutal, corrupt life that is lived in the slums that I can't help but link to City of God. We slowly learn about the somewhat dysfunctional yet beautiful brotherly relationship between Jamal and Salim which leads to a poignant conclusion. Boyle uses a bona fide directing style, oozing with eccentricity, encapsulating the horror of the slums and utilising some truly memorable shots. The film was stunning on the eye, a magnum opus of directorial achievement.Not only was the brutality envisaged stunningly, the compassionate romance between Jamal and Latika was a great inclusion. Although the film could have held its own without it, it added some well-needed happiness to an otherwise grave and morbid mood the film has.The non-linearity and flamboyancy of this picture has won it a dream-like critical acclaim dominating award ceremonies across the cinematic world. At first I didn't agree yet after watching this inspirational film, I can see what the appeal is. The film was entertaining, it plays with your emotions, makes you cry with sadness and happiness. Slumdog Millionaire is truly sensational yet I don't see it being film of the year.The Oscars has given it an astonishing 10 nominations. I feel it deserves, best director, best editing, best sound editing and best cinematography. Gasp you may say by the fact that i don't think it deserves best picture. Well to be honest, best picture is going to be very close this year. Benjamin Button I can see being film of the year. But we shall see.As for Dev Patel, I'm not going to praise him highly for his performance despite it being faultless. His role wasn't a complex one yet he played it to the best that it could have been played. He doesn't deserve his BAFTA nomination and rightfully didn't get an Oscar nomination. Other powerhouse performances (Sean Penn, Mickey Rourke) this year easily overshadow his performance. Freida Pinto was fine as Latika and the actor portraying Salim was excellent. All in all, the cast didn't have one poor performance which is required in such a film. A lack of intensity could have destroyed this film.Slumdog Millionaire is poignant, shocking and ultimately astonishing. It explores the slums of Mumbai whilst building an inspirational story of fate, love and determination. Boyle has really pulled one out the bag this year.Oscars will be close this year.8.5/10",Slumdog Millionaire
291,mfnmbvp,'Slumdog Millionaire' (2008),9,9 March 2012,"Interestingly enough, 'Slumdog Millionaire' was directed by Danny Boyle, the same guy who brought us '28 Days Later', however I have to say that 'Slumdog Millionaire' definitely outshines his earlier work. It's nice when a director can up and change his direction so easily, it's like he didn't even have to stop and think about what he was going to do here, he just knew. The story is inspiring and heartfelt, yet it has its moments of sadness, humor, violence, whatever. In a way, I was slightly reminded of 'City Of God' with some of the camera work and the scenery, although 'Slumdog Millionaire' takes place on the other side of the world from where 'City Of God' was set.The young child actors are exceptionally notable in this case, they do such a great job at displaying emotions toward one another that it almost feels natural. I have never heard of any of the actors in this film before, but our protagonist Jamal, played by Dev Patel, is a wonderful actor and I hope to see him in another movie soon. Anil Kapoor is also notable as our game show host, who is great at playing a two-face. I haven't read the book from which this film was based, but it is a novel, not a memoir or a biography, so it is a tale of fiction. However, it is such an extraordinary triumph of the human spirit, it makes you wish it was real.SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE -----9/10.",Slumdog Millionaire

295,BJBatimdb,get a grip people!,5,28 January 2009,"As I watched this cliché-ridden, manipulative and wholly-predictable film unfold (quite slowly) on the screen, I kept thinking - if this film was set on a Glasgow housing estate, it would have sunk without a trace.I'm gobsmacked that filmgoers have apparently been so dazzled by the fact that it is set in Mumbai that they are blinded to the corny seen-it-all-before nature of the plot and characterisation. I felt throughout that my emotional strings were being pulled by a clumsy child. I didn't believe one single emotion in the whole movie. The brothers Jamal and Salim stuck together when it suited the plot and fell out when it suited the plot. Jamal's love for Latika was poorly drawn and ultimately cardboard. The device of the gameshow was a tenuous link for a series of vignettes which built not to an emotional peak, but a fiscal one. The climax of the show was so predictable that I guessed it in the second scene of the movie. Even so, Danny Boyle found it necessary to beat us over the head with the set-up at least twice more before the end, even using a flashback just in case we might not appreciate the punchline when it was finally delivered with all the comic timing of Stephen Hawking.Nothing in this movie exceeded my expectations, which is a terrible indictment when the film is about a place and circumstance you know very little about. I felt as if I'd guessed every scene in the film before I watched it. The story and characters are so familiar to watchers of small British melodramas that they seem disconnected from their landscape, and I couldn't help feeling that Boyle had failed to exploit the city in the way that would have given depth to the story. Apart from the opening scene on the airstrip, I was never surprised or delighted by the strangeness or odd juxtapositions of the setting.Simon Beaufoy will forever hold a place in the hearts of movie fans for his excellent script for The Full Monty. Slumdog Millionaire doesn't have a tenth of the heart or originality of that film and doesn't deserve the rave reviews it is getting.Stories of young friends or siblings facing hardship and danger are common and I can think of a few excellent films straight off the top of my head that handle the theme so much better (Small Faces, City of God and A Room For Romeo Brass).Simply setting a film in an exotic city cannot - and should not - mask the shortcomings of plot and character.",Slumdog Millionaire

It boggles the mind to think this film almost didn't get made because most in Hollywood thought it would not make any money. Much praise should be given to the brave person at Fox Searchlight who said yes to the production. The adult leads were good, but recognition needs to be given to the actors who played the younger versions of the main characters because their performances were absolutely wonderful. Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail, Ayush Mahesh Khedekar, Rubina Ali, Tanay Chheda, Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala, and Tanvi Ganesh Lonkar have bright futures.

298,middleburg,The sociological ramifications of Slumdog Millionaire in the United States,10,14 February 2009,"Slumdog Millionaire, in addition to being one of the most perfect films I have ever seen, has some very real sociological ramifications in the U.S. Ever since 9/11, there has been a feeling of being uncomfortable around those people with brown skin--from the Middle East, from the sub-Continent, indeed even from Latin America. I would say that Slumdog Millionaire is the first major award-winning film introducing to the audiences here in the U.S. a main character who is Muslim. (I'm trying to think of another movie--but I can't--the main character in Lawrence of Arabia was English--although most of the supporting roles were Muslim--but that's as close as it comes.) The audiences here are seeing Dev Patel--and are identifying with him, cheering him on, hoping he ""gets the girl"" (in addition to the money!) He is a person, a human being--and America is embracing his character. I know this seems like a real exaggeration--but I think it is not all that far-fetched-- to say that in the same year that we elect a half-African American president, we will be giving an Oscar to a film that celebrates the joys and life of a brown-skinned character from the sub- continent, and a Muslim at that. I never thought I would ever see either in my lifetime--but in one fell swoop, it has happened within the same year. Wow! There is hope--maybe there is destiny--that decency, human understanding and compassion will prevail--we are taught this by a big-eared president, and a big-eared lead character in a commercial movie!! All the nay sayers about this film should be ignored--completely! It is not ""Poverty Porn"", it is not prejudicial or judgmental with regard to the country of India. It is not a contrived film, who's sole purpose is to provide manipulative entertainment. Yes--it uses an old-- fashioned, rags-to-riches, boy meets girl-boy loses girl-boy gets girl, where there are good guys and bad guys. This is a story with characters as old as the earliest Greek tragedies, and theatrical presentations from around the world and in cultures in every corner of every continent. But what makes this movie stand out is its glorious beauty, it's rich characterizations, it's basic human morality, it's mind-boggling artistry--I've seen the movie now 3 times--and each time I notice new wonderful details in terms of story line, pure film- making, and structure. This is a classic for the ages--that will live on as long as there are films being shown! And above and beyond the film--is that in having the audience celebrating decency and love and hope and belief in all the possibilities of life--they are forging an understanding of a culture and a people who are no different than any other people--and in so doing, it is creating enduring human bonds and enduring human understanding--this is no small achievement!",Slumdog Millionaire

After all could not this person simply have been lucky in guessing the multiple choice questions correctly. We quickly realize how different things can be in a land different than our own.We do get a sense of the vastness of the country and how different it is than the west. Not only do we get this sense from the shocking way people are treated just from being of a lower class and from scenes of unfathomable squalor, but simply from the questions that are asked on the Millionaire show. When the basic, low value questions will be so obscurely vague to us if we are westerners, but are so rudimentary for Indians, and the hardest most obscure and highest value questions for the Indians are not that difficult for us, we realize the individuality of the country's culture, history and society. When a whole other world of a billion plus people can be obsessed by this person who might win it all, and we would never hear of him, we really feel the largeness of the world and how small we are in comparison.It is fast paced, lots of running and action packed. It seems a bit artificial as cheap thrills and raw entertainment took precedence over realism and a true immersion.The story could have simply been about life on the streets in India and what growing up was like for these ""slum dogs"". The cut to the millionaire aspects seems a bit gimmicky and almost oddly thrown in to make the movie more entertaining.

Much like Danny Boyles work, Slumdog Millionaire has fast cuts, artistic Cinimantagraphy, and a fantastic soundtrack. The raw style mixed with the amazing locations make this film one of the most cinematic experiences you'll ever see. The Sound is perfect, I haven't heard audio like this in a while and am getting the soundtrack immediately. This film needs a Oscar nomination for the soundtrack, it sounds that good. The film itself gives a wide host of emotions; It's funny, sad, thrilling, and happy, basically a very enjoyable film that deserved the numerous Oscar nominations.There are some difficult scenes to watch for the faint-hearted, scenes that make me sad for the slum children of India and everywhere else, and when the movie was said and done, one does feel like the movie had an intense happy ending.

But the game show is only a backdrop to this movie. It's really a romantic film that has something to say about a few other things such as poverty. The story line is fast-paced and the movie is often funny and sometimes challenging. It tells its story in an entertaining way. So, what's not to like about it?Having said that, it's no classic. I gave it 7/10 because it's... err... a 7/10 movie. Enjoyable, fun to watch, interesting, has something to say... but nothing new and the story line is amusing but not gripping.At the time of writing this movie is #34 in to the top 250 movies on IMDb but don't let that fool you... it will slip down the chart as more people see it.

The film's colors are probably one of the best I've seen, in an Indian dominated movie.However, have all the critics gone nuts? If you break it down, this is a very simple 2-3 tiered story involving a boy and his search for his love.The movie has put to frame some of the worst places and conditions on our planet and made it barely tolerable for the eyes to watch. The spoken language is English with very heavy Indian accents at times, but that is comprehensible. It is after all an Indian-centric cast and story.What I do find annoying, and not the fault of this movie, is the fact that everyone now tries so hard to make the Muslim's such victims. I mean we don't have to make them bad, but we certainly do not need to put them on the other end of the spectrum.A few odd-balls do not make the whole population bad or good.Growing up in a multicultural mix in Singapore, I've learn to appreciate each culture's good and quirks. I've also learn that the thing about Indian movies are the dances... it is what's unique about them. However, I don't really see a point for them in this day and age. That said, this movie have left only one dance sequence at the end and it is not obstructive. This is the point where people who cannot tolerate this sequence to leave the theatre. Nice touch for an optional dance.The actors are all pretty believable in their acting. Much to my surprise considering their ages. Seems Bollywood has come of age of late. Even the young ones are getting so good. Of course the veterans are important supporting casts, leading the young actors on the screen whenever they pop up.

I was curious to see the latest film by Danny Boyle since it was praised by regular movie fans and critics alike. I wasn't quite fond of ""The Beach"", but the other 3 Danny Boyle films I'd seen were all incredibly original, compelling and in some way disturbing.I didn't have any idea what to expect of ""Slumdog Millionaire"" except that it was about a slum dog who became a millionaire on a TV game show and that's not really much. But man, it blew me away. The soundtrack was simply amazing and due to its mixture of Indian and Western influence I'm sure it sounds somewhat exotic to anyone listening it regardless of cultural origin. Boyle's smooth editing, excellent sense for soundtrack and cynical world view make this disturbing film a rare gem among anything coming out on film these days.If you asked me to describe ""Slumdog Millionaire"" in one sentence, I would say it's a mixture of ""Citade de Deus"" (Eng: City of God) and a classic romance story, but that would not do this film any justice.

The film then moves back and forth from the interrogation room and the TV sound stage in a series of flashbacks where Jamal calmly explains how each incident in his eventful life made him uniquely prepared to answer the questions put to him.The film is very reminiscent of Danny Boye's cult film and high-adrenalin Trainspotting. There are some really great scenes in the slums of Mumbai. The cinematography is unique including slow motion, step motion and wild camera angles. Even with the direction and look of the film the real power of the film is still in the hands of Patel. All of these items lead to a wonderful film ride, and at times it does feel like a ride. This is hands down one of the best films of 2008 and certainly the best indie film of the year.The poster is also well designed. There are about 8 versions I have found so far and all of them delightful.",Slumdog Millionaire

312,Timbo_Watching,Beautiful film with harsh elements,8,12 April 2020,"This film was absolutely beautiful! It was greatly written, edited and the camerawork was very nicely done! It's one of the few films that made me emotional by making me think about all the people actually living in slums, and that situations like in the film actually happen in real life too.
Besides being so impactful and deep regarding this, this film also managed to make me have a feel-good feeling.A simple teenager from the slums, a so-called ""slumdog"" becomes a millionaire in the famous gameshow 'who wants to be a millionaire' with everyone in disbelief, so much so that he gets tortured into trying to say that he cheated and howso. Because of telling his rough youth he debunked the cheating theory, and thus won the money.Great mix of having deep thoughts to feeling good. Great film.",Slumdog Millionaire
313,John_Truby,A Picaresque Tale,8,7 January 2010,"All the praise for Slumdog Millionaire has been focused on Danny Boyle for his energetic and colorful direction. No question Boyle's direction is terrific. But the real key to the film's success is the script by Simon Beaufoy. Using a unique story structure and scene weave, Beaufoy combines the myth and love genres with some advanced screen writing techniques to build his story to a stunning climax.To appreciate Beaufoy's accomplishment, we first have to look at his challenge. This is the story of a ""slumdog"" orphan boy who grows up in Mumbai with his older brother and ends up competing for the big prize on the game show, Who Wants To Be a Millionaire? Here are just some of the difficulties inherent in the premise: a boy as main character, a story that covers ten years, a mix of myth and love story forms - two genres that are notoriously tough to put together - and keeping the hero's desire for the girl believable and strong. In the Great Screen writing Class I spend a lot of time on specific techniques for developing the premise, since this is where 99% of writers fail. To win the premise game, you first have to identify the structural problems buried in the idea, then come up with structural solutions to solve them. And you have to be able to do this before you write the script.Beaufoy's solution to the daunting challenges of his premise is a triple cross-cut framing device. In this advanced technique (see the Advanced Screen writing Class and the Blockbuster story software for details), the writer cuts between the hero, Jamal, being tortured by the cops who suspect he has been cheating, his performance on the game show, and the story of his life. This is a classic example of how a non-chronological structure is often the right one for a story. But it is very risky, because this much cross-cutting can suck out all the narrative drive.So why does it work here? One of the big problems of telling a myth story that covers many years in a character's life is that it becomes extremely episodic, meaning that individual events stand out and don't build in a single, narrative whole. A storytelling framing device literally puts brackets around these events. They are told from the mind of the hero, so they gain a unity they would not have if told chronologically from an omniscient narrator.Using a child as the main character poses all kinds of problems. A child has limited awareness, he is usually a victim and the audience senses that the most dramatic elements will come near the end of the depicted life. That's why Beaufoy uses the other two cross-cut lines. By beginning with the boy grown-up, being tortured, then cutting quickly to his performance on the game show, Beaufoy brings the most dramatic element of this boy's life story to the front of the tale. Structurally, he has taken the battle step - one of the seven major structure steps that usually occurs at the end of the story - and cut it into pieces. The audience is constantly reminded of the most dramatic moment of the story, and it too builds slowly and steadily as the hero moves closer to winning the big prize.This also allows Beaufoy to connect the game show questions to the key events of the boy's life, a technique that not only undercuts the episodic quality of the story but also makes the thematic point that any life is a combination of chance, freedom and necessity.The torture and game show lines solve another problem inherent in the premise: they are the primary way Beaufoy connects the myth form to the love story. Myth usually covers vast time and space. Love is compact, driven by white-hot passion that tends to dissipate if the story travels. The torture and game show frame allows Beaufoy to establish Jamal's love desire at the very beginning of the story, even though chronologically the hero encounters the girl of his dreams when he is a little boy and then doesn't see her for long stretches of his life. This makes the love story the primary genre, which is a much more unified form than myth.The writer was also fortunate that the writer of the original novel, Vikas Swarup, chose the picaresque tale as the basis of the original story. A picaresque tale is a kind of comic myth in which the hero is a rogue-trickster character from the lower class who succeeds by his wits and in so doing highlights the corruption of the society. This sub-genre is the basis of such classics as Tom Jones, Oliver Twist, and Huckleberry Finn. In the ""greatest techniques"" section of the Blockbuster software, I talk about this rogue-trickster character as possibly the single important element in blockbuster films. From the very beginning this boy is a schemer, able to succeed and even escape death through his quick mind. Faced with terrible poverty and corruption, he nonetheless survives and flourishes. There is even an Indian version of Oliver Twist when a man saves the brothers from their poverty only to force them into his society of beggars.This film is worth careful study by any writer hoping to master advanced storytelling techniques, as well as to learn how to bring together genre forms in unique combinations.FOR MORE REVIEWS, please visit www.truby.com",Slumdog Millionaire
314,Onderhond,Boyle reinventing the Bollywood industry,9,21 January 2009,"Boyle is one of the few directors that manage to work within the solid confines of commercial film but still manage to keep a very modern and unique look. He also knows how to make genre films his own and with Slumdog Millionaire he goes one step further, taking on the whole Bollywood industry. And again, he miraculously succeeds.It's always refreshing to see a new Boyle film. He does things with existing genres. Adds to them, mixes them with others, updates them. It makes his films a little harder to a sell to a hardened genre-loving audience, but for those looking for new things to enjoy Boyle is a most welcome certainty. With Slumdog Millionaire he simple reaffirms that status. While his newest film emits a definite Bollywood vibe it is equal amounts not Bollywood, making sure those who have little affection with that side of the movie industry are not immediately put off by the film.Most notable about Boyle's style is his ever sprawling cinematography. Boyle's use of color is impeccable and what's even better, he is able to keep this up for a whole film. He combines it with strong and vivid camera work and some awesome editing tricks. It gives his films an extra flair mostly nonexistent in commercial film (Tony Scott is the only name that comes to mind, though Boyle is better at restraining himself). Slumdog Millionaire looks lush from start to finish and succeeds in being more than a visual one-trick pony.Equally strong is the soundtrack and more importantly, the way it is applied throughout the film. Though a little too poppy for my liking it flows perfectly together with the visuals and the both of them create a very solid and tight atmosphere. The inclusion of M.I.A. in particular was a pretty welcome surprise and added a lot to the fresh and hip feel of the film, somehow still a very rare thing in the world of film.The film itself is neatly constructed around Who Wants To Be A Multimillionaire, one of the most popular game shows to date. Our local hero is able to participate by chance and through some miraculous leaps of faith sees himself in the final round of the show in no time. Him being from the slums arouses suspicion among the program makers but also gives him a local hero status among the people from his hometown. Our hero is taken to the police station in order to clear his name and through a series of flashbacks we see how he was able to solve every question up until that moment, which are all somehow related to a particular period in his life.A pretty interesting concept which gives the film that little extra and allows Boyle to lean a little more on the drama and feel-good than other movies could've. While the outcome of the film is easy to predict and the whole ending is quite sentimental, no other ending would've done justice to the film. As for the game show part, its function is clear and its screen time limited, so chances are scarce that the film will feel outdated soon simply because the game show goes out of fashion. Boyle really did a good job with that.It's been a long time since I've seen an audience in theaters been this involved with a film. The climax reminded me of young kids watching a puppet theater. Especially when they jump up and shout at the puppets to give them directions (often to point them where the bad guys are). I think more than a few people at the theater were relying on adult conditioning to restrain themselves from doing exactly that during the build-up of the final question.Slumdog Millionaire works on all levels. While it starts off as a light drama it ends as a pure feel-good film and has no trouble making it work. It's a pleasure to behold, the soundtrack is right on the spot and the film never dips. It's good to see Boyle is still developing as a director and even though he might look like a worn out rocker on image, he is one of the hippest and coolest directors working in commercial film today. Slumdog Millionaire is not his masterpiece, but more than an excellent film altogether. 4.5*/5.0*",Slumdog Millionaire

It's a British movie made in India. A wonderfully made film exploring the slums of India. I was momentarily entranced by it. A.R.Rahman as a musician excels in his composing. Cinematography was awesome. A brilliantly, very well written script. Lots of new faces who have performed brilliantly. The movie moves at a wonderful pace. Totally original. The comedy at times were good too. Hahahaaa, destiny is really a funny thing.A touch of the darkness inside India. This movie totally deserves those 8 Oscars. Anyone who sees this film would want to visit the country. If you have not seen this movie yet, well what are you waiting for ? Watch it people. It's worth the money. Definitely going into my DVD collection.I give a 9.3 out of 10.",Slumdog Millionaire
317,Hellrazr360,A Decent Though Unremarkable Film Worthy of Recommendation,7,9 February 2009,"After hearing so many positive remarks about how this was one of the best, if not THE best film of the year my curiosity for it raised. Going into the film, I wasn't quite sure what to expect but I half-heartedly felt that I'd be either horribly disappointed or completely blown away (since I tend to be in the love it/hate it crowd for critically praised films such as this one). After leaving my theater (which was filled with people at least three times my age) I was saying to myself ""eh, it was a good film, but not Oscar-worthy"".While this might sound like I have an overall negative opinion of the film this is far from the case. Slumdog is a perfectly good film that's worth a watch by anyone really interested in seeing it. That said, I can't call it anything more than ""good"" or ""solid"" since it was certainly likable but far from awe-spiring.The story revolves around Jamal Malik who, upon coming one question from winning an Indian version of Who Wants To Be a Millionaire? is confronted and accused of cheating. Up until the last ten minutes the film is told in flashbacks as Jamal explains how he knew the answers to certain questions, with a considerable chunk revolving around him and his brother Salim and the troubled connection he has with Lakita, a girl they meet as kids early in the film. I liked the approach they went with giving the answers to certain questions a backstory from Jamal; I was actually hoping they did a flashback for each question but given the film's overall approach, it's easily understandable why they didn't go with this approach.One of the film's strengths is that it manages to feel authentic with the story revolving around the characters and the struggles they face. While I will say the dialogue felt rather clunky and slightly ridiculous at times the film manages to feel mostly believable thanks to its mostly down-to-earth approach with Jamal and Salim. As for the acting, everyone did a mostly solid job. Dev Patel manages to create a likable character (despite some on again, off again acting), Madhur Mittal creates a very believable adult Salim though Freida Pinto would have to be my favorite performer in the movie as the adult Lakita; she manages to make a great character who's very easy to like and sympathize with.There are a few strong moments in the film that will catch the audiences' attention (almost all of them unpleasant), most of which occur in the first half of the film. Comedic bits are few and far between, which does work in the film's favor since it maintains a core mood throughout the runtime. All told, it's a well-rounded package, with a sufficient ending that feels like it flows well and naturally as with the rest of the film.But why isn't this film anything truly amazing (for me at least)? Mostly because there really isn't anything in the film that's truly impressive or spectacular save for a few select scenes. The acting as I mentioned is solid though some performances are better than others (particularly with the supporting cast), dialogue is hit-or-miss and the film does drag out a bit leading up to the end. These aren't major issues and don't keep the film from being enjoyable, but as the film stands it only holds up as being a good, mildly entertaining watch (and I use ""entertaining"" lightly here).This is a good, solid film that I would suggest watching if you're curious to see what it's like and know enough about the film going in. That said, I can't say this film is Oscar-worthy in my books and is far from being the best film I've seen this year. You may and possibly will like the film a lot more than me for all I know, which is perfectly fine by me; I'd rather at least half enjoy a film everyone else loves than not like it at all.",Slumdog Millionaire
318,PopCulturedwithMovieMike,"An amazing feast for the eyes, mind and heart.",10,29 January 2014,"An amazing feast for the eyes, mind and heart. When I first heard about Slumdog Millionaire, I had no interest in seeing it. As the hype grew for the film and it won an Oscar, it made me even less interested in seeing the film. It was On Demand for free the other day and I thought there's no better way to watch it so I gave it a shot and boy am I glad I did. When I first heard about the plot of the film, I couldn't see how they could make it work. To say that the back story flashbacks and the game show scenes are weaved together seamlessly would be an understatement. From the very beginning the viewer is meant to care for the characters in the film. Even as they grow older, it's believable that they are the same person. Danny Boyle does a great job at capturing the streets of Mumbai. It's filled with life and color even in the face of poverty. Slumdog Millionaire is literally a film that will appeal to everybody. Young, old and everybody in between. I also think that wherever you are in the world, this movie will touch you. I can honestly say it's one of the most original films you will ever see.

It was wonderfully shot; I loved the sequence where the slum boys were being chased with A.R. Rehman's fantastic score in the background. Moreover, the acting of the youngest versions of Salim and Jamal were fantastic.However, the second half kinda let me down a bit. I was not impressed with the older versions of the the lead actors, especially Saleem. He was such a good character at the start but his older version was a poor actor and it just turned into a weak role. Also, the ending could've been better thought out I felt. It was too predictable for me.Overall, this still is a really solid movie, and is definitely one of the year's good ones.",Slumdog Millionaire

I understand people have different tastes but this film is so good that I can't imagine someone not liking it.I don't want to go into the storyline because I think it's one of those films that needs seeing for yourself. When i first went to the cinema I was in awe the whole time, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. When the credits rolled, myself and my two friends (and most of the audience) were just staring in awe at the screen and it was so good i went again the next week and loved it just as much the second time.The first thing that strikes you is the beautiful cinematography, everything is top notch-the direction from Danny Boyle, The writing, the soundtrack, the team work of the production team who seem to love what they were working on and the acting is so good. Not only Dev Patel and Freida Pinto as the older Jamal and Latika but the talent of every actor playing Jamal, Salim and Latika is amazing especially the young boys playing Jamal and Salim (sorry their names escape me) and the 'who wants to be a millionaire' host gives some light relief humour.I highly recommend this film, a friend of mine just rolled her eyes when I told her i had watched this film as for some reason she has a real problem with British films which is a shame because she's missing out not only my favourite film of the year but maybe one of my favourite films ever.When a film makes you not look away for a second, makes you talk about it for days and actually means something then you know it's something special and it certainly is that.",Slumdog Millionaire
323,hbdave_77,film of the year 2008,9,13 January 2009,"The movie has already bagged 4 golden globe trophies & expectations are high to repeat the same history in coming Oscars. More than anyone else I'm happy to see the smiling face of British Director Danny Boyle.He is in his mid 60's & he always remains an underdog low budget filmmaker in Hollywood for years & this is his moment. It's his belief in the script (a novel named 'Q & A' written by Vikas Swarup, which even a few Indians have read so far) & his execution as a director which made the film a history. His best decision as a director is casting an assistant Indian co-director Loveleen Tondon & gave her full liberty of casting. And Loveleen has done brilliant casting to cater the world audience. Especially those slum children including child Jamaal. Apart of sound direction, the movie also scores points in screenplay & gripping editing. Not for a single minute I felt bore in the film.The movie is a moving confession story of a Mumbai slum dweller boy named Jamaal who in the verge of winning a reality quiz show interrogated by the suspicious cops. How Jamaal knows the answers of all questions, how he won 20 million bucks & more importantly his lost love with a platform like this is thing to watch & cherish. The movie is totally Indian in look & partly in Hindi but it's the treatment of balancing fantasy of winning money with stark reality of slum life made it uplifting tale to admire. And it's this balance of film which has touched the right chords of abroad audience.Our 'Madras Mozart' A R Rahman got world recognition on central stage winning golden globe trophy representing 1st ever Indian who won it & it's definitely moment of him too. But the score he gave in the film isn't his best one. All the Indian Rahman fans who have listened his music for years may feel the background score of the film a very normal score compared to his gr8 compositions & themes of last 18 years. Talking about the performances its- Dev Patel & Freida Pinto steals the show with their promising debut performances. Rest of the Bollywood cast- Anil Kapoor, Irrfan Khan, Mahesh Manjrekar or Shaurabh Shukla maintained the nuanced performances assigned to them. But Anil has done exceptionally well with his cheer up anchor of the show with his trademark style. Anil is going to do a thrilling 2nd film with Danny Boyle in lead role. Hope Boyle can exploit well this genius screen legend of Bollywood.Ratings- 8.5/10",Slumdog Millionaire

This movie began Dev Patel's career and he is an extraordinary actor. The music is perfect, at least three songs make the top of my favorite movie soundtracks list. There is even a corny dance at the end (apparently it's a bit of a tradition for Indian films) that I loved and I was so impressed.

325,ilpintl,A celluloid love letter to Bombay...,8,6 January 2009,"Two years ago, I bought Vikas Swarup's innocuously named novel ""Q&A"", but must confess I have not yet made the time to read it. This novel forms the basis for ""Slumdog Millionaire"", a title that is oxymoronic but more apt for the audacious story of Jamal and Latika. Few would be able to resist the disarmingly honest, gritty, but ultimately uplifting and optimistic tale. It is certainly on my personal list of the best films of 2008. The release, in early December, of this cinematic love letter to Bombay/Mumbai could not have been better timed, as it arrived when we needed it most, right on the heels of the 170 horrific murders that took place there on 11/26/08. The film celebrates the resourcefulness and resilience of Bombayites and the live-and-let-live ethos of the city (which survives despite the sporadic outbreaks of sectarian violence and communal riots always instigated by unsavory politicians and sleazy ""holy"" men). Indeed, Bombayites are so consumed with the business of survival, that there is no time to waste dwelling on banal differences of caste and creed.""Slumdog Millionaire"" opens with Jamal (the titular slum dog) as the unlikeliest contestant on the Indian version of the TV quiz show ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"". Equally incredibly, he is just one answer away from the contest's top prize of 20 million rupees. To ensure that Jamal is not a wily cheat, or perhaps to prove him one, the cops are called in and they attempt to beat a confession out of him. What ensues, however, is a series of flashbacks about three interlinked lives, stranger than any fiction, which settles without doubt how the unlettered Jamal could know the correct responses to questions designed to flummox university graduates.While I am a complete cynic in real life, I fell hook, line, and sinker for the film's central romance between the Muslim protagonist Jamal and his exquisite Hindu ladylove Latika. The tribulations of the underdog are a staple of movie plot lines, but this particular story is so much more poignant because it is set in Bombay/Mumbai. We root for Jamal to succeed on all fronts because we're privy to his extraordinary life story.Director Danny Boyle has a playful spirit that was most apparent in his film ""A Life Less Ordinary"". It was about a bungled kidnapping, but his leads took time out to break into song and elaborately choreographed dance routines. Now in ""Slumdog Millionaire"", he gets to indulge this appetite for fun, because his characters though poor, orphaned, and abandoned, are still children, and they unfailingly spot the opportunities for joy and mischief in their bleak lives. There is a wonderful touch of magical realism, where the two rascals Jamal and Salim are mesmerized by an opera performed at night in the environs of the Taj Mahal. But even as they marvel, they remain busy with the job at hand: pilfering the purses of the enraptured oblivious audience.The soul-destroying poverty found in the big city, sinister predators, rapacious goons, underage whores, orphans maimed to better their earnings as beggars, the gleeful scams of street urchins, and get-rich-quick schemes that invariably turn criminal are all depicted without sugar coating, and so might make unpalatable viewing for some. For those who can stomach reality, the payoff is magnificent, for although this is a work of fiction, it closely mirrors the lives of millions. In the human spirit, as embodied by Jamal and Latika, we see that even the most dire, dehumanizing circumstances do not succeed in stamping out decency, loyalty, kindness, and love, and this is what the film celebrates.I'd like to point out that while director Danny Boyle is reaping kudos for his amazing film in the West, the contribution of Boyle's co-director Loveleen Tandan remains unacknowledged. I am certain that Boyle's enormous success in capturing the Dickensian essence and authenticity of Bombay, the nuances of its bracingly blunt vernacular, and the spot-on casting, especially of the child actors, is largely due to Ms. Tandan's efforts. She is listed in the film's credits as co-director, dialogue writer/translator, and casting director-India: proof of her huge portfolio of responsibilities on the film, but not a single critic has mentioned her. Anthony Dod Mantle's spectacular cinematography is another reason not to miss this film: his camera leaps and vaults with the exactly the same euphoria and joie-de-vivre of its child actors,and its restless eye never stops as it sweeps over a city constantly in motion. I am told that he used Canon EO5 still cameras to film in normally crowded locations so as to capture as natural a mood as possible. This works brilliantly in the scenes at the Taj Mahal, and at venues that would otherwise not be filmable.",Slumdog Millionaire

327,Neenee-b,Excellent movie - my final answer,10,18 January 2009,"If someone told me in January 2008 that a film about some street kid winning Who Wants to be a Millionaire, based on the novel Q&A, would be a front runner for all the major awards I would have laughed in their face, but here we are in January 2009 and that is exactly what has happened.With Danny Boyle directing, we follow the story of Jamal, a teenager from the streets of Mumbai who has just won the Indian version of Who Wants to be a Millionaire. With the authorities not able to comprehend how Jamal could win the show and not scholars and doctors he is arrested and told to explain how he did it. The answer is simple - he just knows the answers.We are then treated to a series of flashbacks starting from his early youth and working their way up to the present day, with each flashback intertwining and showing us how he came to know about the answer to the questions.It is a beautifully shot film (right up there with Sunshine), with all the vibrant colours of India contrasting starkly with the brutal life of children trying to survive the streets.Danny Boyle has always been skilled when it comes to soundtracks - who can forget the iconic ""perfect day"" scene in Trainspotting and here it is no different as Slumdog Millionaire is accompanied by a loud, banging, Bhangra soundtrack which fits in so well, especially tracks such as Paper Plane, Millionaire and OSaya (I have downloaded the soundtrack already!) The three main characters, Jamal, his brother Saleem and love Latika are all played by three separate actors, and you cannot fault any of them, especially the child actors who are just so absorbing to watch.It is just a fantastic movie that more than lives up to its hype - it will be impossible not to leave the movie not feeling uplifted. 10/10 in every way and yes that is my final answer (no apologies for the pun).It is also worth staying through the end credits were we are treated to an all singing all dancing Bollywood ending performed by the cast.",Slumdog Millionaire
328,Foux_du_Fafa,One of the happiest films that I have seen!,10,21 January 2010,"I had been somewhat interested in seeing ""Slumdog Millionaire"", but a number of things had prevented me from seeing it until just recently. And I have to say that I'm glad that I finally did. It's certainly now one of my favourite films and – despite its quite dark realistic portrayals of third-world injustice – is one of the happiest, most feel-good films in some time.Having faired exceptionally well on the Indian version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"", the pauper turned phone-operator Jamal is questioned over his lucky streak with the questions posed to him so far. Held by a detective, he recounts the whirlwind story of his life and explains the reasons for his knowledge. The device of the frame narrative works well, allowing intrigue and a brisk pace in a rather episodic piece, yet ultimately providing sufficient character development. As I have mentioned already, the film touches up on the darker aspects of the developing world – child poverty and exploitation, religious and social tension and mafia culture – yet these are not portrayed in a melodramatic way and actually make one question the lack of Western aid in the world's poorer places as opposed to just imploring one to just feel sorry for the characters themselves.Indian culture is portrayed in a kaleidoscope of fancy, yet if there is one problem with the film that I did have, it is that the scenes of the two children travelling to the Taj Mahal, as charming as they may be, do seem like an attempt to showcase as much of India as possible.However, even that doesn't turn ""Slumdog Millionaire"" into a banal travelogue. ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is the perfect film in that it completely embraces the true philosophy of cinema: to send the viewer to another world, where escapism is realism and realism is escapism, and dreams really can come true. It is pleasing to know that a film that is truly made for film audiences as opposed to arguably just critics (read: the countless political/biopic films that come out in the last two months of the year) can triumph at that once glorious now haughty event known as the Oscars.",Slumdog Millionaire
329,nehpetstephen,A gritty fantasy,8,16 December 2008,"Fairy tales have always been pretty bleak, I think because you need a grim landscape from which the goodness can emerge. Morality and virtue aren't that interesting if there's no evil to oppose them. Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire is a Dickensian fable where a huge portion of predestined luck, an underdog commitment to always doing right, and an ability to suffer the system and make it work allows impoverished orphan Jamal Malik (newcomer Dev Patel) to rise above his brutal, oppressive surroundings. More so than ever in Dickens, however, these surroundings are gritty, stark, and disturbing, with none of the comic caricature that surrounded the Scrooges and Fagins in his work.Of course, Boyle's no stranger to horrific morality tales--recall the eye-gougings and blood splatterings in 28 Days Later or the blue baby in Trainspotting. Nor is he unfamiliar with warmhearted family films, as Millions proved. Slumdog Millionaire mixes both, opening with the film's skinny, teenaged protagonist hanging by his wrists, soaked in sweat, about to be electrocuted by two spittle-spewing interrogators.Irfan Khan, as the head police inspector, is convinced that Jamal, an assistant at a call center whose primary job responsibility consists of serving out cups of chai, an orphan with no education, no fixed address, and no recorded background, has been cheating during the smash-hit game show ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"" (the Indian version). Jealousy is a strong motivator; how could a poor urchin who's done nothing with his brain all his life be so close to earning so much money when doctors and lawyers and educated, wealthy people have all failed short? How could an Indian boy who doesn't know that Gandhi's face is on the 100 rupee bank note know that Benjamin Franklin is on an American 100 dollar bill?The bulk of the movie, of course, consists of flashbacks that reveal the twists of fate and important moments that have guided Jamal's tortuous, torturous life--rising literally from a cesspool, escaping with his brother and a pretty girl named Latika from a race riot that kills his mother, living in vast garbage heaps, panhandling on trains, perfecting con games, and falling prey to trustworthy, smooth-talking adults out to destroy their wards. India may be post-caste by the time of the film (in the late 90s through 2006), yet society seems bent on keeping the downcast down: Hindu racists storm Muslim slums, police target poor suspects, and an angel-faced savior toting ice cold Coca Cola recruits an army of ruthless eight-year-olds to serve as deformed panhandlers on tourist-busy boulevards. Some of the handicaps are easily faked; others he inflicts himself, since in this world ""blind singers earn double."" Money costs and you have to earn your pay, even arbitrarily. No boy singer gets money just for a beautiful voice; the eyes have to be taken first. Jamal can't just answer game show questions correctly. First his head must be violently ducked in a bucket of water.So when one of the giveaway first questions ponders India's national motto--""Truth alone triumphs""--Jamal falters. Lies and cons have saved him more than honesty, and having seen what he's seen he knows the reality behind ""Money alone triumphs."" He uses a lifeline and asks the audience, which overwhelmingly knows the answer despite his ignorance. Jamal's success depends on luck and true life experience, not anything he's read. His success is also independently won; when a trustworthy source offers him an opportunity to actually cheat, he struggles with his options, having learned long ago that in his India there are no trustworthy strangers.More interesting than the theme behind his rise on the show--that experience fosters a more worthwhile, meaningful, and memorable intelligence than a memorized education--is his reason for being on the show. Having never known the benefits of money yet having witnessed its destructive power in the life of his ladder-climbing gangster brother, Jamal doesn't particularly want the twenty million rupees he stands to win, probably doesn't even know what he'd do with it. What he desires is more human and more valuable--a chance to be seen by the love of his life, Latika, on the most-watched show in India. Fate has brought them together and torn them apart many times. Crime and money have cursed and fooled and abandoned both of them. With his shy face on the small screen long enough, he might just be able to reconnect with the only person he's always trusted, loved, and been able to depend on, the most beautiful girl he's ever seen, something her billionaire thug husband can acquire but never own, something unsullied by the filth and money surrounding everything.Jamal escapes his interrogation when the inspector realizes, ""You can't be a liar. You're too truthful."" Latika escapes her sexual hostage situation when an important friend realizes that more is at stake than sex and money. And in the end a Dickensian happy ending is earned. It's not one that's incredibly deep--all in all, Jamal and Latika hardly know each other beyond their faces--but its purity shines amongst all the grit.The final question is predictable to anyone paying attention to the details. What happens after the question is a touching surprise.Boyle has earned another success with a fast-paced, pleasurable, and meaningful story. Dev Patel's acting is solid as the skinny, cute underdog, always prepared for the attack but never quite knowing how to prevent it, staring at a bright world at once swathed in color and grime, soaked in a sun that illuminated while it swelters and blisters. The music by M.I.A. also adds a nice touch, with her songs that are simultaneously fun and serious.Slumdog Millionaire is a fable with messages and outcomes that are a little too good to be true and a little too sweet for the most cynical of us, but vivid, on-location shooting and top-notch direction add just the punch to make it rise above.",Slumdog Millionaire
330,michaelxqh,Good but not Flawless,7,28 July 2021,"To be honest I was expecting some more out of this film. For the pros, Slumdog Millionaire has created quite a bizarre story of Indian Cinderella, becoming a millionaire using the sweet and sour life he experienced. However, if we're talking about the sorrow of protagonist out of poverty, I'd much rather watch movies like Capernaum or Shoplifters. The combination of surreal fortune and realistic tragedies is the crack on the bridge between fantasy and documentary. Secondly, the entire story was pretty much predictable, and I didn't feel the slightest emotion of joy as Jamal answered the final question correctly and kissed the girl he got besotted the entire life, because I knew that everything would've ended peacefully and fluently. Compared to Parasite, this work lacked plot twists, more dynamic characters, and viability.",Slumdog Millionaire
331,mbanwait,A great story of an underdog!!!,9,30 January 2009,"SM is a genuinely rousing film about the plight of a young boy who lives in poverty and rises to become a millionaire on a game show. His use of street smarts as opposed to book smarts should a reminder to the many that are uneducated that hopes and dreams can come true. Dev Patel was excellent in his role along with all of the younger actors.I found the film to be immensely enjoyable, with the performances of all involved to be quite three dimensional and believable. The soundtrack to the film by AR Rahman is amazing and he will surely win the Oscar.I read the book prior to watching the film, and it has a lot more details and subplots which were left out of the movie. Although I enjoyed the book, the movie has an emotional punch which leaves you with a smile at the end.A great recommend for those movie lovers who enjoy location filming as well. Danny Boyle did a phenomenal job surreptitiously filming in Mumbai and getting such an authentic film.POST Oscars WIN COMMENTS- Wow it won...amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Slumdog Millionaire
332,jjcremin-1,Who was the third musketeer? I don't know either.,9,17 November 2008,"Before I did, I must admit the only Danny Boyle film I have seen before this is TRAINSPOTTING, desperate youths whose getting high is the thing. It's practically a slapstick comedy compared to what the slumdog kids aka the three musketeers go through. It doesn't matter that the happy ending is improbable. Dramatically it works.The basic storytelling structure is a series of flashbacks. Jamal (Dev Patel) is about to be given the 20,000,000 Rupee question on India's version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire."" The host Kumar (Anil Kappor) strongly suspects Jamal, this slumdog, India English slang for gutter trash, is cheating. He turns him over to the cops who torture him. In fact, it's this torture that launches this narrative.However, when no confession comes out, the Police Inspectoer (Irfan Khan) listens to Jamal's story. It turns out that just about all events that has happened to Jamal's life has been key to all the questions being answered on the show. Also in these images is the smiling Latika (Freida Pinto) whose story gets revealed.In fact, both Jamal's and Latika's characters get played by younger actors along with Jamal's older brother Salim (adult played by Madhal Pattal) who saves Jamal from blindness but who also takes Latika away from him. That these kids survived into adulthood is a miracle onto itself.However, there is humor interspersed. Would you fall into a pile of human excrement just to get an autograph? But mostly, it's the underbelly of child predators, street gangs and even prostitution of barely legal virgins that gets exposed here.I already gave too much away but will close what clinched my like of this movie for me. One of my favorite books growing up was ""The Three Muskateers"" by Alexandre Dumas. I'm glad the last question pertained to that.",Slumdog Millionaire
333,AlienByChoice,A win for mediocrity and political correctness...,5,11 April 2009,"I was afraid of that. Coming to watch an hyped film is always a worry, but never in my wildest dreams would I have imagined the level of disappointment this movie brought on me.I find it hard to explain where this movie fails because it does it spectacularly on many levels.Storyline. You have seen it all before. Honestly, you did. If you read Charles Dickens as a child (Oliver Twist, Nicholas Nickleby) then you have read the script for this movie. And you probably saw it in the movies too, only this time you have also seen it on the small screen at home, if you ever watched ""Who wants to be a millionaire"". It's plain, it's boring, and it's been done before.Acting. B-grade says it all. Honestly, all Dev Patel had to do was act dumb, and he excelled at that. Then of course, there were the kids, but with kids you either get it wrong or right, there is no midway, and this time thankfully Boyle got it right.Score. I couldn't feel that it contributed to anything. Not a fan of Indian music, but I wouldn't care of the music's origins if it did anything to enhance the experience of watching the movie, and the truth is - it didn't. In fact, if I could turn the music off, I don't believe it would have made any difference at all.Camera work. OK, this is somewhat the saving grace, although in a visually rich environment of India it is very hard to mess up camera work, which means that the expectations are very high. And yet again, it is plain, unimaginative, and very very ""play it safe"".Bottom line. The Oscars it received enshrine the mediocrity through revolting political correctness. What a shame. It's boring. It's unimaginative. If you ever read classical novels, you'd have read it all before. And besides the Indian setting, there is absolutely nothing that makes this movie stand out from thousands more like it, including Hallmark low-budget adaptations. Avoid, if you can get over the hype. Or go see it, just to be able to reply ""Yes, I did see it, can we talk about something else now?"" to an excited colleague at work.",Slumdog Millionaire

In owe of the dignity and simplicity of a character forged in the squalor of physical, moral and emotional ordeal of a life  the viewer is enveloped in compulsion of compassion and respectful admiration of integrity and humanity of Jamal's nature.

335,orangeisthenewawesome,Eye opening but a bit cliché,7,7 January 2009,"I saw this film in the theater. By now you may know the gist of the story, but if not, here it is in a nutshell: a slum kid in India gets a chance to win on the Indian version of Who Wants to be a Millionaire. We get to see this young man's incredibly difficult childhood and the hardships he had to overcome through flashbacks. We also gain some insight about his brother and a love interest. The movie is incredibly well made. It's entertaining and I as a viewer was able to emotionally connect with all the lead characters. The acting is fine - neither amazing nor terrible. The child actors are outstanding. Visually it's a great experience. My biggest complaint about this movie is that it is really cliché. No movie like this could be made by standard Hollywood conventions because such a formulaic film likely could not get an approving audience. Only an Indian themed independent film could get away with this. Also, be prepared to deal with heart wrenching cruelty to children. So while it's well made and keeps you engaged you, like me, may get annoyed with how cliché it is.

337,rjyelverton,"""Slumdog"" is visually stunning",6,20 December 2008,"Sex. Love. Death. Fame. Violence. ""Slumdog"" tells an epic story of greed, love, and redemption in under two hours. With an impressionistic style and economic storytelling, director Danny Boyle has crafted a thoroughly romantic tale of treachery and longing. It's a Movie filled with larger than life Villains and a from the slums Hero trying to secure the treasure, win the princess, and vanquish the dragon. But it's also merely serviceable. A way to pass the time.While I didn't dislike the film, I think it falls short of the transcendence it wants to achieve. Boyle wants to create an old school love story with over-sized emotions that sweeps you up and leaves you high on its Movie Majesty and celebration of Love. (See also Baz Luhrmann.) Instead, I was left admiring Boyle's editing as the characters are too thin to leave an impression. Also, the motivations of the film's on again off again villain turn on a dime and wholly serve the script rendering him more a device than person. The movie will give you back what you put into it. An impression of transcendence will have to be supplied by the viewer because the filmmaker is too concerned with crafting a whizz bang movie machine.The film's first fifteen minutes or so are its most gripping. Slum dweller Jamal and his friends play cricket on a nearby airfield and are soon chased away angrily by club wielding cops on scooters. The flight of the slumdogs takes them across the roofs of a Mumbai slum while the screaming police pursue. It's a great, alive scene that gives us an immediate sense of place, poverty, and oppression. Jamal will soon meet the Girl who will become his Quest and repeatedly be hindered by his avaricious brother.""Slumdog"" consistently displays a dynamic visual sense, but leaves much to be desired in the storytelling department. Cynical? Maybe, but the characters are too thin and too motivated by the needs of script to move this viewer.",Slumdog Millionaire
338,chimera-4,One hell of a roller-coaster ride and a great movie.,8,16 September 2009,"This movie came right out of left field and, to be honest, surprised the hell out of me. Everyone was raving about it but it really didn't seem like my cup of tea so I gave it a miss at the movies. Round a mates one night he had a selection that he'd rented out and Slumdog Millionaire was one of them. ""That's meant to be quite good."" I said, so we went with that.....Visually, the movie at first glance seems to lack panache and polish but I think this might have been intentional as the gritty in your face style really conveys the feel of the slum lifestyle. The music as well is excellent and has a definite Indian flare to it even down to the bollywood ending. The acting is good across the board with the young kids in particular being standouts....The plot initially revolves around young Jamal, an Indian boy who is competing in ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"". The story jumps between his appearance on the show, his interrogation after the show by the police who are convinced he's cheating, and the flashbacks which are the stories of events throughout his life that he tells the police of how he knew the answers to the questions. In hindsight some of the reasons for his knowing the answers might seem a bit contrived or a bit of a leap but when you watch how it's all weaved into the story it unfolds beautifully and for the most part convincingly enough...To an ignorant westerner like me who knows nothing of life in any part of India, slum or otherwise, there was also a fascination in the ""slice of life"" attitude of the flashback portions of the movie. Some of it is horrifying, like the whole child-beggar industry and how that all works and the general squalor of some of the disctricts. Some bit's are funny like working at a fast food shop where they fill plastic mineral water bottles from the tap then seal the lids on with glue, plus acting as a tour guide round the Taj Mahal making it up as they go along and then stealing peoples shoes. Not to mention a dive into a latrine then a manic run, covered in sh*t, to a fleeting visiting movie star to get their autograph. There are also heartwarming moments too and a satisfying ending.No matter what kind of movies you're into this one is well worth your time....",Slumdog Millionaire
339,georgebush,not bad,9,16 January 2009,"Slumdog millionaire is an interesting film. Apparently the Millionaire show is shown in other countries with different hosts. The film begins in the slums of India and follows the growth of some kids. The center piece and structure of the film revolves around the game show. When the main actor becomes old enough to be on the game show he is not in the extreme poverty of his youth but he is still struggling. The show may be a ticket to a better life. This is a driving force of the film. The viewer gets to see flashbacks and real time scenes but it is not difficult to understand.So much of this film seems to be something i can relate to. Some viewers will find they have more in common with these people from India than they do with some of the middle class Americans portrayed in some comedies. It would be easy to identify with the characters in this film for some people. You will have to decide which character you like the most. There was another fine film made in this area of the world: City of Joy with Patrick Swayze.The characters in this Slumdog Millionaire think out of the box and some present situations to show honor, betrayal, or loyalty. The film is a drama and adventure. Yes the outhouse scene was revolting and the one short gross scene per movie convention is unfortunately in this one too so I will only watch the film once.. But ultimately, this is a very good film and worth seeing. It is appropriate for mature kids.",Slumdog Millionaire

Compared to anything you can see in a film festival what exactly is so special about this film. Its not Forest Gump which moves and takes you places. The funny thing is the film is moving but going no where. I made no investment in the characters, I didn't care about him. He was not real, his acting definitely want very good either. So character development isn't there. The story is stupid to be blunt. The concept is narrow and just not that interesting. If a script is written from a concept, it is very different from if it is written from a story of human beings on a journey. A collection of unrealistic superhuman independent sketches put together in a cutting room and some of those sketches don't even add anything to the story. Now someone over sold this film and I went out an bought the DVD at the New release rate. Biggest waste of money. I could have got 3 DVDs for the price of this one, I had Valkyre in one hand and I cant believe I put that down for this cotton candy junk. The inter splicing is so over used you would think the director would be able to use it to effect. However it more kills the timing than adds any value. The film takes from cinema and gives absolutely nothing back. There is nothing in this film that you could show to a film student and say here is a good example of Casting is horrid, continuity in terms of the stories intention is amateur. The music is disconnected from the visuals, loud and mood killing save 1 or 2 love themes. It does boast good editing, or good anything.

Alas, I see it is being hyped as just that... when in reality it's just a conventional rags-to-riches movie with an unusual setting (for American audiences). The social commentary in the screenplay is not particularly deep, although I suppose modern India's great contradictions can just stand for themselves. All of the child actors are very good, and Dev Patel is the discovery of the year. Old Bollywood hand Anil Kapoor also stands out as the game show host. Unfortunately the film just seems to run out of steam in the final 5-10 minutes (the resolution of the quiz show final question and also of Latika's situation are rather flat) and apparently Danny Boyle did not know how else to finish the film except with way too many gooey flashbacks and a big rousing Bollywood dance number.

The way it unfolds with Jamal giving us bits and pieces of his life as he makes his way through the questions on a game show is an extremely clever and original way to have a story play out. This is where my admiration for Slumdog ends.The acting isn't bad, but it isn't great either. Danny Boyle used actual Mumbai slum children for the roles so I can give the acting a pass. What I can't give a pass to is the obvious attempt to manipulate the audience using sympathy inducing tragedies.I'm not saying that children in Mumbai slums don't have it bad, I'm sure they do. What I'm saying is that watching a character bumble through tragedy after tragedy just so we will feel sorry for them is neither entertainment nor film. This is an obvious attempt to play on the audience's emotions. You put a poor slum kid through the ringer and then give him a million dollars and the girl of his dreams at the end of the movie and everyone in the theater is supposed to think: ""thank god he finally got some happiness."" Not Me.First of all, if the girl meant so much to him he shouldn't have got the million because that is a much more meaningful message: You don't need money if you have love.Second of all, after enough tragedy happens to one character it becomes meaningless and unrealistic. Every single bad thing in the world is not going to happen to one person, sorry it just doesn't make sense. For true drama to work it has to be at least somewhat rooted in reality, this isn't. They had every tragedy they could think of happen to Jamal just so the audience would feel sorry for him.That is what truly annoys me about Slumdog; the fact that because of this strategy it has received such critical acclaim and won the best picture Oscar.

I haven't been to India in long time, but I find it odd to refer to a computer as 'Mr.' or 'Sir'.I also didn't like the ending where the hero doesn't know the answer to the question who the third musketeer was and he uses his 'life-line' to call the girl, and her answer is, ""I don't know"". So he guesses it and gets it right.What purpose did that serve? She was supposed to be the third musketeer with the hero and his brother when they were growing up. So they could have flashed back and shown another conversation that the three had as children where she remembers the name of third musketeer. That would have been more fun and exhilarating then pure guess.Finally, after his first night on the show when the hero is taken in custody by police and they torture him, even electrocute him, and then they simply return him to the show on next day.I don't know even in India such torture is that brazen. That part of the story didn't fit.In some ways that all fits together because that makes it TYPICAL Indian movie.If you have seen ""Slumdog Millionaire"", you have watched 99% of ALL Indian Movies.Congraturaltions ji.",Slumdog Millionaire
349,youngman44,Best Bollywood Film Ever,9,6 January 2009,"Slumdog Millionaire was arguably as good an ensemble cast drama as any in years ... going back to LA Confidential. It does have a Tale of Two Cities feel to it. But, most haven't read Dickens so that's fine. It really captures the poverty of India but also has humor, excitement, sadness, terror and genuine sacrificial love. The screenplay is lucid and articulate in a way few movies in modern times have achieved. The acting is captivating. This film takes one on a long and winding narrative. I realized after it was over that I had lost myself in this movie - a sign of a great screenplay and great acting. With literally hundreds of superficial, mediocre films in 2008, this film was fresh air. If there is one movie to see - see this one! You will not be disappointed.",Slumdog Millionaire

351,MubukuGrappa,Dis Movie Iz Da Bomb,10,6 January 2009,"This is the best movie so far that I have seen, or hope to see in my lifetime.This movie reflects truth as it is. For example, it portrays how in a city, as populous as Bombay, the police goes relentlessly after one guy, who they suspect of cheating in a game show. This is very important, because usually one would expect Indian police to be corrupt and extract some money from the kid and not do anything more (Bollywood taught us that), but police going relentlessly after a ""Slumdog"" to investigate the possibility of corruption. Now that is what would one call a News!This movie also portrays India as it is: Filthy, poor, hungry and violent. This is something that seems to be very popular theme among the (majority of) Westerners and it exactly fits into their mental picture of India. For example, Satyajit Ray's Apu Trilogy was quite popular (and highly regarded) in the West (at least, among the Intelligentsia), while his Charulata, where people wore clean shirt and discussed literature, is not very well known. This movie also touches upon another very important and popular issue of the present-day India, as seen by Western eyes: The indiscriminate and ruthless victimization of the Indian minorities (such as Muslims) in the hand of the majority Hindu (most of whom are fanatics anyway!). This movie also, for the sake of reality, adds a nefarious, vapid and insulting game show host to the plot (it feels good to see the big-mouthing Anil Kapoor, who said that ""stars"" like him could not just accept a supporting role in a Hollywood movie, even if offered, now acting in an insignificant role in a Western/American/""Hollywood"" production. O, how the mighty have fallen!) This movie could, however, have added a few improvements. For example, the game show could have been shown to be held in the West, and the kid being insulted for being non-white. (This would have sold the movie even better in India, going by the Big Boss/Shilpa Shetty affair.) Also, the title of the movie could have been ""Jamal M. In Da House"".If you have not yet got what I am trying to say, this movie is for you. Go watch it today.",Slumdog Millionaire

When the film was over I did feel good, although the feel good factor was not as great as in other films I've seen, and I did also find that the film was somewhat predictable. I think a film should first and foremost be entertainment, but when that aim has been achieved, a film should also raise issues and make you think about certain things. Although I found this film to be stylistically well-made, I didn't feel that it raised many issues or made me think once it was over. The few issues it did raise (like ""you don't have to be worthless just because you're poor"") didn't seem particular original. If you're just looking for entertainment, then I think it would be worth seeing this film. If you want more than entertainment, then there are many other films I would rather recommend.",Slumdog Millionaire
353,shariqq,"A wonderful celebration of hope, destiny and Cinema.",8,20 December 2008,"Once in a while you get to watch a movie like Slumdog Millionaire. A well-crafted, well-written tale of destiny and triumph, Danny Boyle and Lavena Tandon take us through three timelines simultaneously in Jamal Malik's journey from Dharavi's slums to the Hot Seat of the Indian version of ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"". Encountering a wave of colorful characters along the way and events that leave lasting imprints on his mind, Jamal eventually plays the game with one purpose - and it's not winning.Laced with a wonderful engaging soundtrack by A R Rehman, many scenes of young Jamal are presented with such charm and down-to-earth honesty that you start rooting for the protagonist early on. A few Bollywood actors fill in some of the supporting roles, notable Anil Kapoor, Irfan Khan and Mahesh Manjrekar, to bring added vibrancy to a movie set against and for the undying spirit of a city that's seen it all.Unfortunately, and in a bad choice by the makers, they have made the movie predominantly in the English language. Those familiar with the city, country or the culture will find it absurd that a boy from the slums speaks with a British accent, let alone that most of the other characters are conversing in English (the cop & his ""havaldar"" or the ""bhai"").This glaring issue aside, the movie succeeds on all accounts as a wonderful celebration of hope, destiny and definitely of Cinema.",Slumdog Millionaire
354,uttiyo-sarkar56,Jai Ho!,8,25 March 2012,"Emotional, Disturbing and Triumphant, this is what it is mostly due to the excellent piece of work by Danny Boyle for his effort in making this film with inexperienced actors in a tough location and showing a life of a slum kid, along with decent acting by the ensemble cast, each portraying their character brilliantly and a good,bold and true story with some excellent background music being the cherry on the top. The Story is about a slum kid named Jamal, and the movie shows how Jamal gets a chance in a competition named ''Who Wants to be a Millionaire',and being a slum kid,amazingly going on to win the big prize and answering all the questions. But in his journey to find his answers for this questions, the movie shows his life starting from his village to going around places with his brother and again returning to Mumbai in search of his lady love(Latika), but again parting ways with her due to a fight with his brother(Salim), but how he amazingly again finds to meet her when he becomes an adult,and then miraculously manages to win the competition.The Story is taken from a novel written by Vikas Swarup.The Acting from the ensemble cast is very good mostly due to their guidance coming from Boyle, but every character ranging from the kids to the main actors have done their own roles perfectly. But In My Opinion, the younger and teenage versions of Jamal,Latika and Salim were probably the best actors in the movie, along with great performances from Anil Kapoor and Irfan Khan. The Other actors also did their respective roles perfectly.Danny Boyle has a hell of a job with this film, taking mostly inexperienced kids in the first half of the film and making them act brilliantly,also helping inexperienced actors like Patel and Pinto do their jobs excellently, and has also done a great job showing us the dark side of Mumbai and the slums of Mumbai and also showing how they can try and have such a fun life even though they are slum kids quite brilliantly, and this is probably his best work till date. He Is Bold in making this type of a movie with a very low budget and turning it into an Oscar winner and he really shows his great talents in this movie.The Story written by Vikas Swarup is excellent and bold showing the dark side of Mumbai and how they can have such a fun life even though they are slum kids,they can rarely eat food and have to earn money by selling some items, and he has written an excellent story revealing the ''real India' perfectly. The Screenwriter Simon Beaufoy has done a good job in adapting the story from the novel and making it easy for the crew in making this film. The Cinematography in the film is also very good in showing the slums of Mumbai,and revealing some breathtaking scenery's in Mumbai and going into places no other director/crew can go into, and full marks to the cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle for showing us excellent scenes of Mumbai. The Background Music of the film is just superb,and A.R Rahman has done a superb job in giving the suitable music for this film along with great songs such as '""Jai Ho!', ''Ringa Ringa' Etc etc,and has benchmarked himself as one of the best composers in the world today, and also good job from the other sound crew in making this into a great film with excellent music. This is really a great and bold film due to sheer brilliance of Danny Boyle,along with the decent acting from the whole cast, a great story and excellent music to sum it all up, this really is a must watch for a movie lover.8/10",Slumdog Millionaire

The lead actors have appealing traits and authenticity within their characters, despite some of their actions. The comedic mischief is usually bad, but compared to the atmosphere, seems justified.

Say what? There's no child abuse in this movie. At all. Poor street and slum kids doing what street and slum kids do. It's amazing that Americans' perceive this as abuse. Sorry to shatter your tiny world but the rest of the world lives differently than the US. OK, my rant is over. From what I gather this is based on the book Q&A. Never did read the book but this story plays out great and reminds me a Lot of City of God (which was stellar as well). In a nutshell the movie starts out introducing you to our main hero and his brother who are slum kids that go about grifting for basic survival and kicks. A mysterious and creepy guy named Maman takes in orphans and has sinister intentions. He takes the boys in as well as their new friend Latika but they escape. However, Latika is left behind. Without getting into the plot too much or spoiling the movie, we see our hero and his brother grow older and change all the while we see Jamal hoping to find Latika. Overlaid on this back story we find Jamal in the present and on an episode of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire.Danny Boyle directer a winner and all the accolades and awards this movie will get are well deserved. There are great comedy moments, tension, high drama, and action in this movie. The acting is not forced and comes off very natural and the cinematography is five stars.

361,Diego_rjc,What did everyone saw on this?,6,22 March 2010,"'Slumdog Millionaire' was, without a doubt, the most critically acclaimed movie of 2008. Danny Boyle's picture simply won eight Oscars (including for Best Picture, Director and Adapted Screenplay) and nominated to two others. It also won seven BAFTAs (also, including Best Picture, Director, and Adapted Screenplay) and four Golden Globes, along with tons of other awards, becoming the first movie since Steven Spielberg's 1993 'Schindler's List' to win Best Picture at the Oscars, the BAFTAs and the Golden Globes. The problem is - I'm still trying to figure it out what did all those critics and the audience saw on this movie?'Slumdog Millionaire' tells the story of Jamal Mailk (Dev Patel), a Mumbai teen who grew up in the slums and is participating on a TV program called ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"". In the break of the program, he is accused and arrested of cheating. While he is being interrogated, events from his life are shown, explaining why he knows the answers to all the questions of the program. The Oscar-winning Screenplay is loosely based on a novel by Vikas Swarup and adapted for the big screen by Simon Beaufoy. Through Jamal's story, the movie denounces the hard life in India's slums, showing all the dangers of that little kids suffer when they're alone. But the movie only shows a poor and filthy India, that's why many people are gonna have wrong ideas about the country because of this movie. Even though the story gives the possibility to show a nice adventure, with Jamal, his brother Salim (Madhur Mittal) and a girl named Latika (Freida Pinto) trying to survive in the slums, it is hardly believable. It's impressing how everything in Jamal's life sort of conspires for him to know the answers, how he remembers his childhood in so many details and how the questions are all related to his life. This bugged me throughout the whole movie, but the final question was the most forced one. I'm not going to spoil it here, but you'll see how nonsense it is. I know the basic plot of the movie is how a kid from the slums can win a TV game-show, but that's where I have the problem with.The acting here is a little under average. All the supporting cast does an average job, with the exception of Anil Kapoor, that was very nice as the game-show host. The three main characters are portrayed at three different ages here. Surprisingly, the best members of the cast were the little kids. Even though most of the cast are newcomers, the kids steal all your attention here. All three of them, portraying Jamal, Salim and Latika, are great, and give strong performances. The not-so-little kids that portrayed the three of them in an early-teen age were fine also. The ones that had more recognition were, of course, the actors portraying them in the late-teen age. They were the ones with more screen-time, but not of them were really good. Madhur Mittal was kinda bad as older Salim, so was Freida Pinto as older Latika. And even the most acclaimed one, Dev Patel, wasn't really good. Even though he got a few nominations for his role in this movie, his performance could've better.Undoubtedly (or at least in my opinion) the strongest point of 'Slumdog Millionaire was the directing. Danny Boyle does an excellent job directing this picture. If it's not his best work thus far, since he was also excellent in both 'Trainspotting' and '28 Days Later...', it's certainly one of the best. The camera work he uses in the movie is incredible, getting some unbelievable shots. His job in the transition of each scene is also remarkable. Another good thing that I enjoyed on Mr. Boyle's job were the montages, that served to make the movie much less boring. The only thing that I didn't like on his work was the end credits. After all the events depicted in the movie, every actor started dancing on a train station to the sound of A.R. Rahman's original Oscar-winning song 'Jai Ho'. I know it was meant to be a tribute to the Bollywood pictures, but in my opinion it ruined the movie completely. Your good and old black end credits were just fine, thanks.Chris Dickens was another one that really deserved the Oscar award he got. His editing work is as remarkable as Danny Boyle's directing one. If it wasn't for him, the montages and the shot transitions weren't gonna be as good as they are. Anthony Mantle's Oscar-winning job on the cinematography was excellent. The yellow tones in every scene really set the mood for what's to come, and make the movie feels like India. You get some beautiful shots of India's famous locations and landscapes, like the internationally famous Taj Mahal (of course they had to show it). One quite important thing on 'Slumdog Millionaire' is the Soundtrack. A.R. Rahman composed several songs for this movie, and they are all quite good. Aside from the montages, the movie also utilizes those songs in a very, almost surgically put way. The only time that the music didn't serve well was in the end credits.Overral, 'Slumdog Millionaire' is not a bad movie. Is not a bad movie at all. Danny Boyle's directing work was of the his best so far, the editing is great, so is the cinematography and the Soundtrack. But the naive writing, the hardly-believable storyline and the poor acting keeps this movie alway from being a masterpiece. And the dancing at the end credits served to make the movie worse than it is, ruining the movie's mood completely. So, with all this, I'm still trying to understand: What did everyone saw on this? Even though 2008 wasn't exactly the best year for movie-making, with the writer's strike and all, there certainly were better choices for the Oscars, the BAFTAs, or whatever awards you mention, than this picture.6/10",Slumdog Millionaire

It portrays an India that is as attractive and modern as it is archaic and repulsive. Astonishingly it even succeeds in presenting Indian police as both brutal and sympathetic, both the guardians and prisoners of a corrupt society.

363,bollywoodplusplus,A Bollywood sprinkled Hollywood movie - must watch!,9,10 December 2008,"The making of the film is very Hollywood, but the script is very Bollywood! And I don't mean anything in a sarcastic way - this is truly an amazing collaboration! The Bollywood has been producing dreamy, Utopian, feel-good (or sometimes bad), heart-over-mind, good-over-evil scripts for ages, and it has not only worked for thriving industry, but is slowly expanding way beyond Indian subcontinent. So something that appeals to may be couple of billions of people can't be wrong - can it?On the other hand, Hollywood takes keen interest in realistic, mind-over-heart, fact-over-belief scripts. Nothing wrong with that either.This movie brings the best of both - you cannot afford to miss it. The story will keep you engaged from the word go. Very able acting by the newcomers, Dev Patel (Jamal) as a spl mention. But the young slum urchins played by child actors are absolutely fantastic! Cinematography is pure master craftsmanship - hardly seen Mumbai (Bombay) in such vivid visuals! A.R.Rahman's music brings a bit of unconventionality - miles apart from his bollywood affair, and rightfully so! This kid in the movie reminds me of a clip of a young urchin near a tourist place in India, who has picked up conversation in many languages just trying to sell something to international tourists. (Watch: youtube watch?v=DZOwvQRs-W0). That kid never went to school, yet he can carry on a conversation in more languages than any of us can!

It's a film that is sure to have every viewer hooked and jumping up and down on their chairs! I think the description of Boyle that the film makes you root for Jamal (Dev Patel) is correct. Juxtaposing Jamal's life and struggles, and the tension of a game show makes one see behind the ""oh this is just some scripted segment like Wowowee"" maxim. The idea of ""destiny"" is well-established by Boyle and the editing. The overlapping of the events from Jamal's life makes one jump up and down on his chair on the final question. To think I was screaming all over the shop in tension! The fact that Boyle takes a Bollywood approach makes it a refreshing spring in the selection of the nominees for Best Picture, and that is a great edge, unlike some films like The Reader, or Milk, or Frost/Nixon, which seem to be quite dusty in approach.From start to finish, it's as if I was watching a Bollywood film, and the establishment of India in the film really makes one feel it rather than just see it. At one moment of the film, I almost thought that when I came out of the door, I would be seeing green cabs like the ones they painted in TAR 13! Another element of the film that makes it memorable is the cast. From the fat policeman extra to Dev Patel, one can see that the extras are not your randomly picked guys. They embody their minor roles, and could quite give Viola Davis her male counterpart! I applaud Dev Patel. The actor clearly deserves an Oscar. I don't know about Michael Shannon, but where is the compassion! At parts when Dev Patel's character gets angry, goosebumps just erupt like mushrooms! The guy clearly is a good actor! Kudos! I hope he gets another role which will merit him a nod.' If he would have an Oscar clip, I would recommend the ""There is no message, there is no message, there is no message!"" part. Bone-chilling and fear-provoking.That's the key word--GOOSEBUMPS. When I get goosebumps while watching a film, I know it's a film worth watching and skipping almost 2/3 of Philosophy for (shhhhhh!). The whole film I was just having them! Final thoughts about the film--well, no doubt-- it's an Oscar! No, I mean four sure Oscars (Picture, Director, Adapted Screenplay and Editing). I would be so torn if it doesn't win Best Picture! This is a film that had everyone talking, and I'm sure by the end of the day, you'd be one of them too...",Slumdog Millionaire

But I held my apprehensions intact because I sincerely feel the Americans only love poor and hungry Indians fighting for survival..Look at past Oscar nods for Indian films(Salaam Bombay, Lagaan) the same aspect has been resplendent..Slumdog Millionaire is one of those films which deal with a very tried and tested formula but the way it has been dealt with is what makes it different..Its the story of rags to riches of a Slumdog(a boy brought up by the atrocities of a Slum and thereabouts), his grit, his head on take of adversities and the way he triumphs in the end..Its feel good cinema from start to finish and will put a smile on your face throughout and you would love to root for the ""Slumdog""..The narrative and screenplay is what makes Slumdog Millionaire so different..Its a non linear interplexed way of story telling which basically revolves round the super success of a ""Slumdog"" in a reality game show and side effects thereof..But Slumdog Millionaire is the most realistic take on BPL India and no two ways about that..What astonishes me that an American director has put across a face so realistic of Indian poor diaspora which no Indian had ever managed to represent so convincingly and entertainingly..Dev Patel the protagonist playing Jamal Malik is brilliant and the word doesn't exactly suffice..He is a revelation..He deserves all the accolades he is getting..The only problem I had with him is his British accent which actually sticks out sorely..Anil Kapoor is brilliant as well and I am happy to see him finally getting his due..Irrfan Khan and Frieda Pinto are good..But the scene stealers really are the kids who play the protagonists in their respective young ages..They are lovable and have been directed brilliantly..Danny Boyle who somewhat got lost after the similar gritty Trainspotting redeemed him self somewhat with Sunshine last year and with Slumdog Millionaire he proves that he is one of the very best in Hollywood..His thought provoking cinematography is brilliant and as previously mentioned he has managed the non-linear graph of the story quite brilliantly..And a special mention for A.R.Rehman who just makes Slumdog Millionaire a treat..Each and every interlude is just magnificent and so well thought about..Even the ringtone in the protagonist's mobile phone is excellent..A must watch and highly recommended but I just wish that Americans would look beyond the anorexic starving Indians and make a film on Indian glory and more so because our very own director are impotent enough to do that..Kudos to Boyle and wish him luck at Oscars..9.5/10.",Slumdog Millionaire
370,sudhirkumarpal8,A mind blowing thriller.,8,25 July 2021,"Thriller, or I would say, a rare instance of permutations and combinations, to the point where everything fits perfect. No doubts it can do wonders, let alone making one slum dweller, millionaire. Though these instances are rare and so are these one night rags to riches people.When KBC was on air in 2000's, I used to think how much money they are splurging with every episode. That was the first TV serial solar raining money on people. Earlier and even today the most I see any TV or radio program giving out to people is a meager movie or a restaurant pass worth a couple of hundred bucks. On the other hand it was giving crores to people per episode. After watching this movie came to realise that winning 1Cr is once in a blue moon scenario not everybody wins 1Cr, most settle for thousands, and what the show runners are making is a fortune because the TRP is so high that they still make much more than what they give.The movie is so beautiful, so full of emotions and so full of the real world and how the not so privileged live. Whenever I went to Taj or any festival or a Show I used to think that what was in front of my eyes was the only thing that was going on but what goes on behind the curtains is an altogether different world, that's totally opposite to what we see and this movie is is a window to that world. It shows you what you are not supposed to, at least as expected by the society.Music is amazing and so are the visuals and the acting by the child stars especially those kids from the slums was terrific, and it was so real that in some scenes they don't seem to be acting, seeming more like the real characters.Dev Patel was great for a debutant and so was Freida Pinto. There was something wrong with the makeup of her or may be that's what was required of the character because in real life what she looks much more beautiful and gorgeous.#SlumdogMillionaire 8/10.",Slumdog Millionaire

372,rsa5387,Boyle Triumphs,10,4 January 2009,"The power of education, money, and technology pales in comparison to the strength that an individual can attain through the force of love. An eye-opening, heart-wrenching, pulse-pounding film on so many levels, Danny Boyles Slumdog Millionaire is a brave and novel attempt that both entertains and informs. The film is very novel in the fact that its main story centers around a poverty-stricken boy who ends up on the Indian version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire. As he escalates closer and closer to the top prize of Rs. 20,000,000, the producers think hes a cheat and he cant believe whats happening either as every question somehow relates to an incident in his life. Though the plot initially sounded far-fetched, it unraveled in such a fast-paced and carefully crafted manner that by the end I was on the edge of my seat rooting for Jamal to win that prize, and realize his dreams. Presented in a series of flashbacks, most of the narrative is spend chasing our protagonist throughout India, from the slums of Mumbai to the steps of the Taj Mahal, as he struggles to live in a world that is seemingly against him at every turn. The only shimmering light in this boys life, and the reason he is on the show, is to find the love of his life, a girl named Latika. Though how he manages to find and lose her throughout his life was absolutely heartbreaking, it also helped shape the subsequent events that help him answer the questions on the show. Therefore the film informs through the exploration of three subjects: Depicting the harsh reality of poverty in modern-day India, the ethereal force of love that rings with total purity and absolute selflessness, and the role destiny plays in ones life. Its a very harsh, realistic film while also having elements of a fairytale, ala having an underdog rise to the top. Its very well acted, with the child actors who play the young versions of Jamal, Salim, and Latika leaving the largest impression. Even their adult counterparts and the supporting players including Bollywood stars Anil Kapoor and Irrfan Khan lend natural, engaging performances. Moreover, its gorgeously shot, edited with aplomb, and has a score thats both haunting and irresistibly catchy. In summary, walking out of this one, I felt absolutely floored at the power and beauty of Slumdog Millionaire. This is definitely one that cannot be missed.",Slumdog Millionaire
373,regnarghost,Dishonest and shallow love-story with lots of style and sentiments,4,1 April 2009,"This left me dumbfounded. I cant believe this film has garnered so much attention, let alone adoration. This got some the Oscars? I just realized this from reading glancing over the board, i though it was The Curious Case Of Benjamin Buttom that won best picture. Oh well.I don't know what to say. Its directed with great style and i love that it takes place in Inda.But its a little hard to care for such a flat character as the protagonist. But off-course you root for the underdog right? Oh, i definitely did initially, but as the film progressed and the love-story kicked in, i started to care less. Take the scene where the brothers rescues the girl. First, would she really still have been a virgin? A man that burns children eyeballs probably would have sold her to someone already. Does this matter?Yes because the film shouldn't soft panders us like that.And would she really have been wanted to escape with them?Run away with two street-thugs? No. People are not just trapped physically you know, people are trapped by their social situation. A girl in her situation probably would have chosen to stay as a dancer where she at least could earn some kind of living and had a sense of security.But does this really matter? Its a ""fairytale"" right? Sure, but the film calls this kind of thinking and critics to itself by describing the ugliness of poor in almost gruesome details. It wants to have it both way. Its a dishonest and shallow picture in so many ways.The love-story is underdeveloped. There is little chemistry between the two brothers. And its main-character is, as i already stated, very flat.There are some great scenes. Jamal falling down in crap-house and then getting his autograph was funny and disgusting. But i found the film decreasing in quality as it went along. The scenes in the actually Millionary show was also quite good with the host turning in a good performance, being that kind of character that is written for the audience to dislike and loath.",Slumdog Millionaire

What is good about this movie is that it shows a descent film can be made without lots of animation and special effects, the acting was what made it an above average movie. The fatal flaw in my opinion is the lag, the detail and side stories had some parts that just drug. I think the editing could have been better as it seems that some parts were excluded, and others included that were backwards.

376,rajandey,"Not very realistic, though very well shot",7,9 June 2009,"I watched this movie when it debuted at the box office but didn't bother writing a review till now. The movie was entertaining on all fronts, just all this critical acclaim isn't rightfully earned. A lot of things shown in the movie are just very unrealistic, I know this because I am Indian myself. First things first, performances were very refreshing. Of course I knew most of the actors as I've seen them on screen while growing up. (Anil Kapoor/Saurabh Sukhla/Mahesh Manjrekar/Irffan Khan, all of them were good. Dev Patel as Jamal did a fine job, he is not a thorough looker, but that is what the role demanded. Freida Pinto as Latika was good too, though she needs to polish her acting skills more. Madhur Mittal as Salim was outstanding, I haven't really seen him before but he sure has command over acting. All the kids were absolutely amazing, they acted so natural without having acting classes or whatsoever. Superb! Out of all the younger actors, in my opinion Tanay Chheda stood out as the strongest. Music was of course outstanding, because the music has been done by maestro A.R.Rahman, I have always been a fan of him, though this is not his best work, I'm glad he got an Oscar for his composition, and made his name a trademark in the market of international music. Jai Ho and Ringa Ringa are absolutely foot-tappable numbers.Now the bad points... I understand the kids later grew up at places where tourism is a big thing, so they learned English. But it is certainly not realistic that the police cops were also talking in English to Jamal when he was being questioned, not just them... almost everybody was talking English. It would have been much better if they would have just talked in Hindi with included subtitles for viewers. Instead of letting the protagonists talk in English because it looks better than subtitles, that made it totally fake.Second thing... Kaun Banega Crorepati? (Or Who wants to be a millionaire?) was never a Live thing on TV, sure, of course I understand that they can make it live because someone has reached the last 3 questions, but they should have somehow narrated that in the story, just demands a little creativity. Thirdly, Salims character should have been written better. It still remains unclear/confusing why he changed in the last moment. It would have been better if Danny would have let Salim converse with Jamal first (On the phone even..) that he realised his mistakes and is about to make up for everything.These three things caused me to cut three points off the total mark for Slumdog Millionaire. The hype isn't really needed, its a fine product, but not flawless.:) Overall : Watch Slumdog Millionaire if you love good cinema! Thumbs up!",Slumdog Millionaire
377,adrian290357,"A very good, imaginative film that also depicts India truthfully",8,2 April 2009,"This is an imaginative film that uses the much beaten flashback technique in an unusual way -- as part of a TV competition. The direction is first rate and clearly deserves the Oscar that it got. The acting is also very good, the youngest Jamal and Salim emerging as absolute gems. Main actor Dev Patel is excellent if a bit static at times, seeming constantly puzzled by events around him (then again, had I won 20 million rupees I'd probably look puzzled too! And with a beauty like that to share it with...) The photography is of a very high caliber indeed and it helps convey an image of India that reflects its physical beauty but also reveals many of its shortcomings, especially from a human standpoint. The film laudably does not shy away from depicting the ways children are used, including maiming them so they are more valuable as potential beggars. I was not so sure about the brothers symbolizing the division between Muslims and Hindus but all credit to the film for raising it. Slumdog Millionaire boasts some sound action sequences -- the one involving Salim killing Maman is particularly well done if hard to swallow -- and, in contrast, some fine comic relief moments that help make it a riveting flick throughout. I saw some reviews that compared it to ""City of Angels"" - Cidade de Deus -, in some cases calling it a copy of that Brazilian film. In truth, I think the point of contact between the two films is that they happen in the slums of their respective cities, otherwise they differ, principally in terms of character building and narrative technique.Ultimately, I felt I had watched an engrossing and intelligent film that provided an exciting example of globalization and cooperation across cultural boundaries and which might well serve as a blueprint for the future of movie-making.",Slumdog Millionaire

Not only is it a very well done film and entertaining story, but it couldn't be more relevant.The film is the story of two Muslim boys living in the slums of Mumbai, who are orphaned by a pogrom against Muslims. (Unfortunately, such an event occurred in real life). They survive by their wits, and their wits are considerable. One ends up on a game show where he is poised to be a multi-million rupee winner. How did he end up there, and why is he getting all the answers right? The movie is the story that answers those questions. It is also an intense drama, and an expose of what India is really like.

But it somehow kept my attention up.I doubt if it's a 8 Oscar movie, but I think it really deserves 8 points and worth watching..

380,wolftab-1,Not as Good as All the Hype...But Good Nonetheless,7,4 April 2009,"Slumdog is a good film overall, but I did not understand the massive hype surrounding it. It is not one of my favorite films from 2008. However, in terms of all the Oscar nominees it was the Best Picture of that group. The film centers around Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) who is accused of cheating while being a contestant on the Indian version of Who Wants to be a Millionaire. He is sent to police headquarters where he is subsequently tortured into revealing who helped him and why (apparently in India, you are treated like a terrorist for cheating on game shows). This leads to Jamal regaling his captors with stories from his past that coincide with each question that he answered correctly. As a child, Jamal befriends a beautiful girl Latika (Frieda Pinto) and he falls in love. However, his brother Salim, who doesn't hesitate to betray Jamal at every turn keeps ruining his chances with Latika and makes her vanish from his life. But Jamal vows to find her and save her. One of the main reasons he becomes a contestant on the show, so he hopes she will be watching. The film culminates with Jamal being released from police custody to go and try to answer the final question for 20 million rupees, where in an attempt to phone a friend, gets the surprise of his life.There are some aspects of the film that are clichéd and confusing to me. My favorite parts of the film were the sequences of the main characters as children and the horrific things they have to endure to get by on the streets of Mumbai. Danny Boyle is an exceptional director and once again he does a good job with the source material. The acting was decent as most of the child actors I believe have never been actors before, so they did a pretty good job. It is worth seeing but again, I don't think it was earth shattering.",Slumdog Millionaire

Boyle moves beyond the formula -- not a lot, but enough to keep you smiling and interested and saddened and everything else that comes with the story of one of the billion or so people from the world's slums. He has captured a gorgeous depiction of India and a lovely romance.There are some weak points: The romance is nearly entirely left up to the viewer to provide, unreasonable coincidences must be ignored, and the tragic but happy ending is obvious from very early on.There are worse flaws, though, and here, they make sense. This is a bigger-than-life picture befitting a bigger-than-life locale and paying homage to Indian cinema. The dance scene during the credits is a tiny added pleasure.Go see this to feel good and be entertained.",Slumdog Millionaire

They shouldn't even share a name. There were so many things changed, that it made to movie too different from what the story was originally. Okay, the main idea is the same, but all the details and the parts that made the book spectacular, were removed/changed. I can't stop wondering, why this movie has had so many views and so many praises. Haven't people read the book? Or am I just demanding too much?I can't say much about the acting, because I couldn't continue to watch this.

You can't go anywhere at the moment without someone telling you to watch this film and the industry yaddering on consistently about how its the much amazing thing thing to arrive years. Hype aside, this is one hell of a film. Every part of it is just wonderful. I want to watch it again but i don't want to ruin it. I was so much more moved than i ever thought i could be - disturbingly and unexpectedly so.The very first thing is the incredibly beautiful photography. The colour grading, depth of field, use of lighting and overall feel is just aesthetically perfect. Every single shot has been thought out for the purest stunning film-making beauty. You absolutely cannot fault the camera-work, editing or cinematography. Every director, DoP and production team aspires to make a movie that looks this stunning on screen.It's a fairytale of course, but brutally underpinned by the savage brutality of corruption, exploitation and abuse. It woke me up to the work done by children's aid agencies and the sheer darkness of Homo Sapiens, but also to the steadfast driving power of romantic love and hope itself.The story revolves around a boy from the slums (a ""slumdog"") who is appearing on a game show and has answered all the questions correctly despite his lack of education because each one answer is provided by a memory in his past. The message is that destiny has led him to be there, and he has gone through each situation so he can gradually answer each question at that moment and get to the prize that he was always going to get to, and give everyone hope simultaneously. The reason for the tragedies was so he could get the prize. Suffering has a purpose and is all part of a grander plan - it is written.All the pieces are there - the helpless girl, the corrupted brother who redeems himself, the evil barons exploiting the vulnerable, the romanticism of poverty (as much as there can be one), all in a unique cultural setting. A lot of people will have been cynical of Bollywood (me included) but for me the truly wonderful thing about this film is the real-life pride and hope it has generated in India.The young lady who screamed at me down the phone to watch it as soon as i could is getting a big kiss!",Slumdog Millionaire

I saw this last night with my wife and we both enjoyed it. I'd managed to side-step most of the preceding hype for this one and all I was really expecting was a less violent 'City of God'. The idea for the main story being revealed through flashback while the central character is being interrogated is not a new one (The Usual Suspects) but is it done very well here. Dev Patel is somewhat laconic but very good nonetheless, as is the actor portraying his brother. The gameshow host and the main police Detective are also very good characters. The birds-eye-view shots of Mumbai, and the Bombay slums in particular, are really great and some of the editing is very propulsive and helps carry the story along. Great soundtrack, too. Not overly violent and i think that it could be enjoyed by a wide variety of ages which is definitely a plus and no doubt has had something to do with it's widespread appeal.7/10",Slumdog Millionaire

D: it is written.There aren't many moments in a movie consumer's life when you know that the movie you're watching is gonna be a classic. And I'm not talking about ""Back to the future""- kind of classic, but rather that people will say: ""Once in your life you have to see Casablanca, The Godfather, Forrest Gump and Slumdog Millionaire."" I'm sure, the light of this movie will shine for decades. The plot may sound a little funny: a teenager from the slums of Bombay wins at a quiz show, not because he's educated but because of destiny. To each question there's a point in his life that leads up to the right answer. You could ask: what are the odds of that? But you just have to accept that the story is all about fate. The life of the slum dogs is harder than what any child in the world should be forced to experience. It is heartbreaking how the main character who loses his mother as a child in a street fight motivated by religion, who's constantly exploited by the men, who never knows what he's gonna eat tomorrow, whose brother becomes a criminal and rapes the girl he loves, doesn't lose his confidence in the world nor his power to love. The essence: you learn a lot more about life that way then by going to college. It also shows the development of India from a typical third world country to a global player with a corrupt system overflowed by organized crime. The story telling really is classic. There are tons of unforgettable pictures and little side stories. It definitely is Danny Boyle's best movie, and it is gonna win ""best picture"".D: It is written.",Slumdog Millionaire

393,Egg_MacGuffin,D - Highly Overrated. Final Answer. Where's my check?,1,15 March 2009,"Here's yet another extremely overrated film from 2008 catered specifically to awards and little else. Color me unimpressed.While it's not as dire as Benjamin Button or as erroneous as The Dark Knight, Slumdog is certainly not a good film. It's not technically bad, either. It simply exists. It's a movie you watch rather than experience.I am literally in a state of shock these days at all the films masquerading as high-class or even art when they are riddled with so many *fundamental* mistakes. Screen writing 101...they get that stuff wrong! Not the hard stuff, the simple stuff. How? I am baffled.Slumdog's story relies damn near entirely on coincidence, which is a hugely detrimental factor when attempting to create audience sympathy. I didn't feel for the kid on the show. I wasn't given a reason to. If that were me on that show, I would have never been asked questions that I just so happened to know the answers to by chance. This kid just so happens to know the answer to the questions he is asked and little else. He lucked out! I did not sympathize with him, I envied him! I simply could not put myself in that situation due to it's complete insanity and lack of realism.The search for the girl is introduced rather late, and before then, there isn't much to root for in this story. So essentially, you can begin watching this film at that point and completely understand the plot and miss nothing of importance.The fact that the kid had one question left was not properly communicated to the audience, which diluted the suspense of the situation.The fragmented nature of the story doesn't make it easy to understand the narrative, even when the concept alone creates the plot beats for you. This film seems to go out of it's way to make things extra-complex, as though it's trying to cover up something that's lacking...Another thing that jumped out and bothered me...there are plenty of scenes that simply have nothing to do with the kid on the game show...or scenes that take far too long to get to the necessary bits of info that we need. It plods around for quite some time as if it's trying to make up for something that's lacking...I also do not enjoy the new-age, pointlessly over-stylistic directing style employed here. It was distracting, perhaps to cover up something that's lacking...When something, *anything*, is not right, you look at the fundamentals. This is true in everything from football to film-making. Without knowing, or by simply ignoring the fundamentals, you end up with horrendously flawed films such as this, The Dark Knight and Benjamin Button. And what's really sad is that these are the most highly-praised films of last year.When did the standards drop so low? Did I miss a meeting? And can I still vote?",Slumdog Millionaire

396,Cs_The_Moment,Over-hyped But Interesting and Immersive,6,15 March 2014,"I eventually got round to watching this film and found it intriguing. It had initially sparked my interest after it shot to fame at the Oscars, but I felt, possibly as a result of the hype surrounding it, that it fell a bit short of my expectations. There are no terrible aspects of the film, but there were definitely features that far outshone others. Set in the slums of Mumbai, the filming is raw and honest, showing a vulnerable side to India. The story switches constantly between the past and present, gradually unravelling the tangled events in the life of Jamal (Dev Patel); however this constant switching distracted somewhat from the clever way in which the storyline is woven together, despite the fact that the revelation that past events all link to the current situation. On occasion I found it difficult to follow how one piece of flashback linked to the current scene, and at places in the middle of the film it felt slightly repetitive; thankfully, a balance of well thought through flashback links exists.The flashbacks provide the best acting within this film, as the story is mostly enacted by young children who play their roles well. The relationship between Jamal and his brother in particular is demonstrated best through these younger actors. I found the love story aspect of the film to be somewhat less convincing however, possibly because I felt that this aspect was one of the biggest causes of repetition within the film and was rather predictable from the beginning.There is a distinctly cultural feel, as expected, which I think was the most interesting focus of this film. Many of the scenes, from within the slums, to the way the characters interact with one another, are unlike typical Western life, and are at time shocking. This was the most interesting concept of the film – the scope for thought and comparison between what different cultures consider ""normal"" life – and the film encapsulates you within this context.An interesting watch with a good story, boosted mainly by the visuals of the film which help simultaneously cover the imperfections of the script and enhance the overall immersive feel. Ignore some of the hype and lose yourself in the unusual setting to allow the story to flourish.",Slumdog Millionaire
397,sfiver,Oscar waste...again,3,1 June 2009,"After winning eight Oscars I was all set to experience a masterpiece. I dunno, but I didn't get it. Do I need to watch it again? Is this a new genre? What am I missing? I did not enjoy the cinema theater experience - as I rented it and watched it in HD. That might've contributed to my lack of understanding or sensory deprivation.Hence, I saw what seemed like a ""young love"" story set against the sometimes horrid background of Mumbai, India. The slums and all that goes with it. The flashback sequences with the young children, then as young teens is compelling. Then suddenly we're thrust into the future rooting for the still young Jamal Malik the contestant on India's version of ""Who wants to be a millionaire."" All of the questions somehow reflect and ignite memories of his street urchin childhood. This is not an innovative concept. We can all guess the ending.I grant you - the photography is beautiful and I guess the kudos for sound, editing, etc., that the academy bestowed are probably deserved. Dev Patel as the older Jamal seems out of sync. He's just too pretty and does not fit the part.Well... One of the best movies... ever made? Nope! Not even the best of 2008. Good, compelling, interesting and no more.",Slumdog Millionaire
398,yogsottoth,"Will someone say ""Emperor has no clothes!"" please?",1,28 March 2009,"Because he's full frontal nude! This was not a good movie. Simple as that.Starting from the first scene, my whole enthusiasm was drained off when I saw the cops torturing a guy for doing good in a competition. My mind was boggled. Has there ever been a more ludicrous, more absurd opening in the history of cinema? I mean who shows their script utterly sucks in the very first moments? Even bad action movies don't do that. It felt like a punch. (You thought it was gonna be good because of all those Oscars, eh? Here you go! POW!)The following sequences where we witness our characters' past were far from being sincere, real, or authentic. I can't believe people compare this to City of God. It felt so... amateurish. Danny Boyle has totally lost his edge. There was nothing impressive. I don't know how to quite put it right, but there was this ""We're so happy to be making this film!"" feeling all over the movie and it especially didn't work well for the supposed dramatic moments. They were not real, not new, not original. A little bit of Oliver Twist, and some bad humor. Nothing memorable.And the show... Ah, the show... A vulgar, cheating, lying, conniving bully of a TV show host? Where do they find these ideas? You can't just suspect a competitor of cheating and send him off to be electrocuted! In a place where a TV show like that is being made, these kinda stuff just cannot happen. This is a fact. Nobody can say anything to make it okay. That was the one most stupid character idea ever to be realized on screen.And they even told about their suspicions to the press without so much as trying to frame him with some lie like they found something on him. How disreputable is that for the show? And is it so incomprehensible to think that maybe he just knew the answers? ""Doctors, professors can't go where he went."" my a**!!! As if the questions were prepared for geniuses... The first half was all about India and they even had questions with humorous answers that -like the cop said- a 5 year old could answer. This was *very cleverly* written to legitimize people's suspicions of the cheating thing but instead it made the lead guy look like a borderline idiot. And didn't the host think that maybe the guy could make a complaint, or at least talk to the press? Was he gonna cover it up with his strong ties to the police and threaten the media? He's a TV personality for god's sake! Not a made man! Oh god, it was so absurd.And has nobody warned the writer about the ""perfect chronology between the events in the guys life and the contents of the questions"" angle was way too off? Too forced? You gotta be a bit more subtle when you're dealing with stuff like destiny since you're trying to make a real movie. Either go crazy and say ""In my movie's universe these things are normal."" like Woody Allen does, or make it a bit more realistic and reasonable like it was in the movie Crash. This was just lame, childish, BAD writing. Oh and the lead character must have had such a brain, they should kill the guy and study it. He remembers everything! If our brains stored information like that... Man, I don't even what would happen!And the ending. The *perfectly* thought out ending where the easiest question in the world comes as the last question, just to tie it all up with a not-so-meaningful memory from his childhood. So cheap. The chaotic brother who just can't decide what to be, suddenly goes paladin and he, very quickly, brings a solution to the girl's problems and sets her free, and even handles the communication problem between the lovers just so that they can have the conclusion talk that will wrap the movie up. So cheap. And he kills the boss who, very conveniently, enters the room first. (come on, man... why would a crime boss enter a room like a deer when he knows there's something suspicious going on?) And the third act is done! Writing is that easy guys. And you can even get an Oscar for it.David Fincher must have been so annoyed... When you can't even trust the Academy, what's the point of the whole awards concept?Please let's stop this craze of cheering for bad movies just because of their hype! First the Dark Knight and now this. Teenagers go ape**** over horrific stuff like Twilight. What is going on? I don't think I can handle another one.",Slumdog Millionaire
399,JimSDCal,A great movie,10,30 January 2009,"This movie is rightly considered the front-runner for this year's Best Picture. It is easily the year's best and one of the best of the whole decade. It is directed by Danny Boyle, who should win the year's Best Director Oscar, and is about a young man, Jamal Malik (Dev Patel, who should have been Oscar-nominated) who is a contestant on India's version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"". Jamal does very well on the questions of the show, which are very difficult, and the police believe to have gotten so many questions right, Jamal must have cheated.But in telling the story of his life, amidst grinding poverty and oppression, Jamal tells how he was able to know the answers to the questions that were posed to him. Jamal's story is mainly about how he combated his dire circumstances with his brother Salim and how he has always loved a young girl named Latika. In fact Jamal went on the game show hoping Latika would see it and that the two might be reunited after years of separation.I went to this film expecting a lot and was surprised to see that it was better than I hoped for. It tells an uplifting story and mixes gritty drama, of how Jamal used his wits and courage to get by in a world designed to grind him down as he is only a ""slumdog"", with romance as Jamal never forgets Latika and only dreams that against all odds that the pair can get back together. So, this film gets a grade of 10 and the highest possible recommendation.",Slumdog Millionaire

401,bhatian,Seriously; This film is no crap!,10,24 March 2009,"The film teaches us all a lesson on 'how taking people's crap can lead us to success'. It is not asking us to be an 'ass-licker' but instead making us stronger by showing us the difficult sides of life.Here we have the character Jamal who is innocent, simple, happy, and takes life as it comes. Jamal's simplicity leads him to path which we all think is only possible by being a crook, street-smart, firm, confident or positive. Whereas in this film, Jamal achieves his destiny by just moving on with his life and taking every new day as a 'brand new day'.I think we all have a lot to learn from Jamal, and it's not easy for us to follow in a short span of time. Hence i urge everyone to view this film few times to let the story sink into our brains and hearts.Remember: ""There is no use fighting with crap.....because it is crap"" N.

402,wwefreakjon,I'm sorry it wasn't that great,7,2 March 2009,"OK yes the cinematography was fantastic and the directing was phenomenal but the movie was just not that great. Critics and audiences alike have been praising Slumdog has the best film of the year. I just don't agree. It was too happy in the end. Mainly I didn't like that he won the show. Maybe if he lost the game and still got the girl I would have appreciated it more. I think that there is a reason that this movie was so universally praised; the economic crisis. Everyone is in such a foul mood with either losing their job or not being able to get that big screen TV, that when they see a very optimistic movie they love it. I'm not saying that Slumdog Millionaire was a horrible movie. It was just not as good as the critics imply.",Slumdog Millionaire
403,tracy_flick,"If there are no schools, where do kids learn?",7,30 January 2009,"In obedience to some feeling - a subjective one - I want to embrace Danny Boyle's ""Slumdog Millionaire"" because in a medium of much darkness, here is film that sparkles like a halo in the night sky, with images so visible, and so visibly distinct, they replay in your mind long after the screening. Within a few days of seeing most movies I forget most of the individual shots in predilection of the most fruitful, whatever they should be in regards to visuals or sound properties. I saw this movie a week ago, and can recall virtually every scene, but deeper than that, the number of moments within a scene are unforgettable. Yes, if you are familiar with Boyle's filmography you will not think this notion even mildly curious. He is a very good filmmaker, and a show-off. Could he make a straight-in-front-of-you drama like ""The Godfather"" if he was asked? Could he let the actors pull more of the dramatic crux from their talent? If ""Slumdog Millionaire"" were a novel I would describe it as an aureate piece of fiction. The movie, by chance, was actually based on a book and, sinceI have read the work, I am pre-empting myself by saying it does not fall into the same category of this movie. Q and A, by novelist Vikas Swarup, is a great read, and if you love the movie I suggest you take the time to investigate the source material. Unlike the book, which relied heavily on the main character's sorrow at being refused his deserved winnings, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" rallies to a higher level of narrative complexity, aiming most prominently for a tagged-on love interest. Romance in a fairytale is fair game, but not so much when the actual actors are sidelined by the filmmaker. There are hundreds of brilliant shots throughout, more than most cinematic experts will have experienced all year. The harsh reality is that the style weighs outthe substance, especially if you are an Aristotelian disciple. The screenplay exhibits a discomposure that leaves an inertia on the experience, however magical it may have appeared.The best way to understand a person is to tell stories about them. The best way to tell stories is to jump from one tale to another with no method to the process. In ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" the stories we learn about the young man at the heart of the picture, Jemal (Dave Patel), are told in the actual sequence of order he lived through them. Every scene of his past is grooved into specific episodes that are related to the series of questions he is asked on the Indian version of a popular television quiz show. The movie ponders Jemal's status as a contestant; a successful contestant no less. Time and time again Jemal comes up the correct answer. How is he doing it all - even when he admits to not knowing an answer for sure, his instinct comes up trumps? Lady-luck is on his side if we accept his word as honesty personified. Maybe he is regurgitating information linked to him through some intricately sophisticated crowd partnership? Is he simply fortunate, or a genius posing as a slumdog? Not every man can be great, but greatness in men can appear from anywhere, including the poverty-stricken slums of Mumbai.Read the full review at my personal website: --http://www.sightforallseasons.co.nr",Slumdog Millionaire

407,unbornpaniwala,Watch it at least once while you are still alive,6,25 December 2008,"The movie has already earned a lot of praise,recognition and awards till now and hopefully will go a long way into becoming one of the most watched classics like 'GodFather','The Dark Knight',''Pulp Fiction',etc.Being from the city Mumbai around which most of the movie revolves I can relate to the kind of philosophy this movie follows. It has got a lot of dark and ugly moments. But behind or inspite of these horrible aspects of life there are certain light and beautiful elements and characters that when discovered give hope that survival is possible even in the most unreasonable conditions. This is what makes disgusting look surprisingly awesome at times like many of the scenes in this movie. One aspect of this movie is the literal story about a filthy and uneducated ""Chaiwala"" becoming a millionaire having to suffer an ordeal and his gruesome past with the lost love of his life. But there are many other aspects of this movie each telling their own story from the history of one of the toughest cities in the world to the scandals of child abuse and an apathetic system. In the midst of all of this you find the most unlikely thing called romance and its not as typical as your girl meets boy. The director has done a good job at keeping the story as real as possible although it is just a work of fiction. In a sense many of the things in the movie do happen in a non-glamorous way in a normal Mumbaiites life. He has offered a glimpse in the psyche of some of those devastated by the workings of this city. This movie's success belongs to Danny Boyle because of the way each of its crucial scenes have been dramatised.The actors look real too and apart from Anil Kapur and Irfann Khan, everyone is fresh in this movie. Most if not all have done a good job at depicting the directors vision. My only complain is that sometimes they do appear to be more sophisticated than the people whom they act as in the story the main reason being that English is largely used in this movie, understandably so to cater to international audiences. But I want to clarify that people in India do speak English although not the uneducated especially those living a low life. Being an Indian I found it distracting at times that the actors were speaking in English ever so often because we are not used to seeing a character of an Indian policeman or a gangster speaking it let alone being fluent. Also this movie is not about Mumbai or India in general because we have a vast culture and this is just a dark variation of it.Go ahead and watch this movie with or without expectations, you are going to be satisfied enough to watch it again some other time.",Slumdog Millionaire
408,dataconflossmoor-1,One Question One Experience,10,10 April 2010,"This was a very well thought out movie which deserved to win the Academy Award for best picture in '2008. Based on an impoverished citizen from India who went on to be a contestant on ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"", the whole plot manufactures a very ironic correlation. It appeared as though any question that the ""slumdog"" was compelled to answer on this show, ultimately became a supercilious reflection of some kind of experience in his precarious life. As the plot thickened, so did the depiction relating to the intensity of oppression and emotional disarray that besieged the ""slumdog"" with regards to his whole dubious environment.This American film, which had a lot of Indian actors and actresses, as well as many Indian producers, wound up being one of the best American films ever made in recent history. The cinematography was sensational, the acting was thoroughly believable, and the directing was emphatically first rate! Any film which wins the Academy Award for best picture in the year it is made, will often times make a concerted effort to purport a unique ideological perspective to the movie audience. I thought ""Slumdog Millionaire"" was the well deserved recipient of the Academy Award for best film in '2008! I firmly believe this to be true mostly on account of the fact that ""Slumdog Millionaire"" cleverly articulated a pejorative authenticity with it's set of prevailing circumstances!! Anyone who is interested in seeing one of the best films in American history, they should view ""Slumdog Millionaire"" See this movie!! Five stars!! Definitely!!",Slumdog Millionaire
409,Lover-UD,Good effort to draw story of luck driven Slum-boy,7,12 January 2009,"Slumdog millionaire is a movie, I find over-hyped for everything. Number of movies on the similar line had already hit the floor and not noticed before they perished from memories. The movie is an endeavor to draw the life of a boy, born at Mumbai slum, rolled by his fortune to face all the worst happenings, that can come to a kid's life, controlled by some gangsters, also having a jealous brother, his profound love for a girl, that actually drive the life for boy.Boy Jamaal has portrayed as an extra intelligent human, who learns thing while running, is more knowledgeable than MBA's. The story speeds up in the background of a TV show "" Who wants to be a millionaire"". The way Jamaal's answers being mapped to incidents in his life was sometime indigestible. Pluses are those parts of movie having childhood of kids and story of the 2nd Saleem. Some portions of movie seemed very unpractical. Show host behavior was also unanswered in the movie. Overall this was an good effort to sketch the life of slum guy, driven by his luck and finally landed into the money.

410,hotfrederick,"Really good, and tragic",8,18 January 2009,"Hi,I have been reading the good and bad reviews of this. I hope this might appease the people, especially Indians, who found it insulting to your culture.I want you to know that I, and I am sure many others, will not assume that the 'slums' could sway people to assume that this is the general picture of India, and not be different to many other countries with poverty issues. All countries, however varying, have their slums and wealth, have stupid people bent on power trips, be it with money or with religion. Please, do not think that one commercial film can depict a country in a lesser state than others. I read someone here write that the Chinese would never allow such a film to be released about their country. I lived in China for almost 3 years, and I believe me, in general, the power trippers there have a lot to learn, no less from India. I have never seen so many people live in poverty, and still do their best to be strong in a culture that treats its people so badly. Anyway, this is my opinion, but I have seen it first hand. I did not live in a hotel and avoid it while I was there. I will not go back to China because of it, regardless of what financial advantages I could achieve to live there.I can tell you that, to me, this movie really brought the Bollywood style palatable to the Western viewer. It made my initial aversion of going to India become one of fascination. I have man friends who love India (I can't remember none who disliked it), where reviews of visits to China are mixed. I love the colour, love the determination of these children, and that Jamal overcomes whatever befalls him to be a confident man who gets the girl. I found his and Latika's energy really strong, particularly in the end, and the dance sequences. Above all the tragedies (please do not say they do not exist, as they do in all countries), there is this amazing joy. I see that in the India depicted in the film, above all else.I can't watch again the scenes of horrible people exploiting children (appalling in any culture) , but do enjoy Jamal's tête-à-tête and his not being intimidated by the WWTBAM host. Some people are born with such traits; Jamal could be one. Anyway, I love the film. Very cool.

It's almost comforting, in a way, knowing the best will become of our characters. The film isn't about waiting for some sappy ending, but about building up and culminating a story to enthrall us till the end. And the journey found here is exhilarating. It tells a story that requires us to become a child once more to relate. We don't just sit back and watch, the tale evokes our own memories of grief, hope, and love in a way of contrast. You undergo a truly personal experience with this movie. None other this year has come close to the stirring magic this incites. It doesn't tell a love story, but rather a story of love, friendship, and destiny, tangled up in a web of poverty, greed, and deception. Simply beautiful, sad, inspirational, and brilliant film.

414,The-Kissable-Writer,Rags to riches fairytale that wins hearts.,8,23 March 2009,"Destiny is to drama what codependency is to romance films. At the start of Danny Boyle's ""Slumdog Millionaire"", the audience is confronted with the question: how did Jamal reach the 20 million question? a) he cheated b) he's lucky c) he's a genius d) it is written. During the course of the film the a, b and c options are eliminated as we witness the bizarre ways how a street rat gets to know the answers to every one of the questions on the famous show ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"" Jamal and his brother are orphaned at a young age when their mother is slain in a religious hate crime. They live on a landfill until a mob like figure notices them and picks them up for the use of organized begging. At this point in the story, the two musketeers (as the brothers call themselves) have met up with a third, by the name of Latika. However, they do not know the name of Dumas' third knight. As in most great love stories, circumstances hinder Jamal and his soul mate Latika from being together time and time again: when it's not the ruthless underworld of Mumbai, it's Jamal's pathologically mean and innately jealous brother Salim, and even the game show host plays an intricate part in making their path towards each other labyrinthine.I expected an uplifting family film but came out surprised at how gruesome and bare-boned the film turned out. There's one scene where a child is blinded for life with what I presume is hot oil that is particularly disturbing. Luckily for us, director Boyle also put in a healthy dose of comic relief and heartwarming moments. Especially the way the brothers gather sustenance and money is amusing. They hang upside down on the side of a train to steal food from travelers, and they charge tourists for a tour of the Taj Mahal with completely made up facts.In many ways, ""Slumdog"" follows a traditional rags to riches trajectory, where one's lucky to escape poverty and with means comes love. However, what Boyle's trying to say is not sit on your behind and wait for fortune to find you. He's saying pursue your passion tenaciously. How lucky Jamel may be, he's partly responsible for making his own luck. He uses his street smarts to track down Latika, going in the mouth of madness to do so, namely his former mob begging and whore circuit. He doesn't even give up after Latika rejects him because he knows she's just scared and he needs to be brave enough for the both of them if he wants them to be together. ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is a very good film, no question, but it is not the great masterpiece of 2008, the way ""No Country For Old Men"" or even ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" was for 2007.",Slumdog Millionaire

The movie focuses on a young man named Jamal Malik who grows up in the slums, and plays Who Wants to be a Millionaire so that he can get in touch with his true love Latika. The movie traces his journey as a child with his brother Salim, and his relationship with Latika. We see haw these 3 individuals end up on very different paths. Some may argue that the movie seems very implausible, because this kid is from the slums and he's clearly getting all the questions right, but despite this the movie is just amazing. The actors all very good, including the children from the slums who steal the show. Dev Patel does a good job, Freida Pinto is good as well, and the supporting characters are also done nicely. The movie evokes a lot of humor but at the end of the picture your rooting for Jamal to win, and when he does your on the edge of your seat. Without a doubt the best movie of 2008, and AR Rahman creates a wonderful score for the movie as well. Definitely check it out.

417,TrevorJD,Both heartbreaking and uplifting!,10,13 December 2008,"This film encapsulates the predominant feeling and impression I have had about India ever since I travelled through it  that it is the people's thirst for life despite incredible adversity that so endears me about the country. There are scenes in this film that are absolutely devastating and others that will make your heart soar, often at the same time! Particularly the scenes involving the protagonists as children - one scene in particular will haunt me forever and gave me a devastating new insight into the world of child beggars. Be warned, you are going to cry in this film. I did. The film follows the story of Jamal and his brother Salim, reflected through the Hindi version of 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire'(!), the major quiz show that Jamal manages to appear and become a national hero on. As the show's host cannot understand how a 'slumdog' like Jamal can have the answer to all the questions, he is brutally interrogated by a couple of security officers as to HOW he knows the answers. It is through Jamal's life experiences that he knows the answers, and we uncover it in the film through flashbacks. It is a life that involves abject poverty, religious violence, crime, love and many other 'life' experiences that we witness through Jamal and his brother Salim's life; and also through the relationship with his lifelong love, Latika. The performances all round are excellent, the cinematography mesmerising, and the script both absurdly hilarious and heartbreakingly real. How the two brothers manage to survive is extraordinary, much like the film itself. This film has already won a slew of Audience and Critics awards and has recently been nominated for Best Picture and Best Director at the Golden Globes. It deserves every one of them.",Slumdog Millionaire

422,kjewitt,Not terrible but don't believe the hype,6,7 January 2009,"This isn't a long film by modern standards but I spent the last quarter waiting for it to end. There are lots of good things in it - the images of Indian slums are dazzlingly put together and there is some nice humour in the face of adversity. Best of all is the music, which should definitely bag an Oscar. But there is a lot wrong with it. Here are my main niggles: 1. The device of linking Jamal's answers on ""Millionaire"" to stories of his past life works at first but rapidly gets repetitive. Here the film suffers from its relationship with the novel. This sort of device works better on the page than on film. 2. The central love story, which is imposed on the film in order to give it some narrative drive, doesn't really convince. Frankly when he kissed her at the end I didn't care one way or the other. It was impossible to care, because we had never been given enough insight into the characters' feelings for each other. 3. The author of the book is by his own admission is a highly privileged man who has never been to a slum. He is no nearer to the realities of Indian poverty than I am (in England). Many of the incidents are the sort of things which regularly crop up in outsiders' views of India. For instance, the mutilation of children to increase their income from begging has been described in the memoirs of dozens of English sahibs. I found many of the episodes stereotypical.Overall this is a good film and much better than the usual Hollywood nonsense, but it's too clunky and contrived to be classic as some have claimed.",Slumdog Millionaire

426,turk_rooster,Thanks for All the Fuss,6,25 January 2009,"Slumdog Millionaire, for all the great cinematography, does not really capture the essence of Mumbai. Plenty of Indian movies capture the true stigma of poverty, or the true horror of the underworld, far better. Let us for a moment give Danny Boyle the artistic license, and run through the vignettes here. The depiction of poverty is a sham. The rioting is unconvincing. The beggary racket is trite and equally unconvincing. The fact that each answer coincidentially relates to each (painful) vignette in the life of the protagonist is a cruel joke? Is this even a movie worth making a fuss about? There is great cinematography, but in the end I feel sorry for the legions of Indian directors, unwept unhonoured and unsung, whose far better portrayals of Mumbai go unnoticed simply because they lack the ""brand"" of a Danny Boyle. If this movie is worth four Golden Globes, some of India's movies of 2008 are worth at least as many Oscars",Slumdog Millionaire
427,MadiZone,Slowpaced Millionaire,5,4 July 2009,"This movie has a fairly interesting premise. A young uneducated man becomes a millionaire on a gameshow after getting every single question right. Not because he's a trivia buff, but because each answer is extracted from previous events in his life. The movie primarily deals with flashbacks illustrating these events. They show that the young man has led a hard, impoverished and dangerous life at the bottom of Indian society.This kind of tragic realism is interesting in the beginning, but as the boy reaches adolescence, the flashbacks begins to bore you. The movie tries to compensate for this through a love triangle, but it comes across pretty cliché and unbelievable. Because of this, the main thing pushing the suspense level is the increasing winnings on the gameshow and that's not enough to keep the movie going.If you like scenic landscapes and enjoy watching impoverished children struggling in a cruel world, this is a movie for you. If you are looking for interesting characters and an integrated plot that keeps you watching, you might be in for a disappointment.",Slumdog Millionaire

429,action-man101,excellent!,8,21 January 2009,"Uniquely original fable with charm to spare. The tale of a young Muslim man from the slums of Mumbai who wins 20m rupees on the Indian version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire - and the story of how and why he knew the answers. Told mostly in flashback we are shown the young Jamal and his elder brother Salim, and how they seek to escape their poverty-stricken existence after the brutal killing of their mother at the hands of religious extremists. At the beginning of the film as Jamal is being tortured by the police ,who believe he cheated on the show, we are asked how does a ""slumdog"" from Mumbai know all the answers? Slowly we are shown. For all those people who believe that India is a charming, mystical place full of awe and wonder, need to watch a film like this. Mumbai is shown to be the polluted, disgusting, corrupt-ridden sinkhole it is and the treatment of the street children is heartbreaking, even to a cynical sod like me. Many of the films best scenes are in the flashback sequences as Jamal, Salim and their young female companion, Latika, struggle to survive on the streets. The performances from the young actors who portray the main characters younger selves is astonishing and one forgets that we are watching actors (as its supposed to be in movies but often isn't). If Charles Dickens were alive today he would probably be writing something like this as many of the issues that were close to Dickens' heart (poverty, street crime, family, honour) are to be found here - there is even a Fagin character as well as the gang from Oliver Twist. It also has a Bollywood-style mass dance number as the icing on the cake. A must-see film. Note to Hollywood - please don't remake this.",Slumdog Millionaire

I enjoyed it for the most part but near the end I thought it got a bit tedious. Here are some other problems - Latika and Jamal (the older ones) seemed to have no personality. All this raving for Dev Patel's performance...well I just didn't see it. He was dull and so was the girl who played Latika.This movie is also VERY clichéd. Cartoon mob bosses and the troubled brother that has to redeem himself in the end. Yadda yadda, like you couldn't see all that coming? The earlier stuff was much better and I enjoyed the first two ""Jamals"" a lot more.Good ending credits, though!",Slumdog Millionaire

The people torturing him are asking him how he knows all the answers for a game show on TV that he was participating in. The film goes along with each question on the game show. The question is asked then it goes to a flashback of Jamal's childhood. Through Jamal's crazy young life of stealing and living on the move with his brother, Salim, he gets all the answers to the questions. nobody has ever won before so the show host and the cops think that he is a cheat. This film I feel shows India well in two different stages. One is from when Jamal and his brother were kids. The other point of view is when Jamal is grown up and on the show.",Slumdog Millionaire

Set in the slums of Mumbai, the story traces back through each successive game show question from Jamal Malik's (Dev Patel) tragic childhood in abject squalor, through his life as a teenager in the slums with his criminal-minded brother Salim (Madhur Mittal), and Jamal's pursuit of lifelong crush Latika (the incredibly beautiful Freida Pinto).

This kind of ""curiosity hunting"" is the same for us - Mumbai, which is prosperous and filthy, Taj Mahal in the sun and dust, dark streets and lanes, slums on garbage There are too many elements and symbols.

434,funnycc,Hidden brother's point of view: maybe the only truth in this world,8,6 June 2020,"What attracted me the most in the whole movie was not the love between the male and female host, but the point of view of the elder brother who was hidden from the perspective of the male host. The film also uses a dual-view narrative. Although it is a 2008 film, it still has a strong sense of history, a comfortable and pleasant look, and poeticizes the life and death, love and evil of the past generation of Indian slums. The way of expression is conveyed to the viewer, and the artistic quality of audio-visual language is also amazing. Especially on the eve of the film's climax, the younger brother hovering on the last question was stuck between several choices, but the older brother chose to let the heroine leave. The foreshadowing here already shows that the most intense part is also the part that has been established-when the younger brother wins the bonus, it is when the older brother dies.In the slums, not everyone is as fortunate as a male lord. Born in the quagmire, they can still maintain a clear self-knowledge of the world's lust and love and hatred. More obviously, not everyone can have the same as the male lord. Luck, money and love rely on fate.In fact, the role that arouses the hearts of all viewers in the film may not exist, and the generation who really lives in the slums, their fate is more like those children who have no parents and mothers, and are blind under the control of gangsters. Eye-catching beggars, little girls who were sent to brothels... And as brothers who directly experienced these cruel people, it was the most powerful resistance force in between. From the beginning, he was destined not to be a coward or a crushed person because he had family members to protect. So he was brave, decisive, and fierce, and every decision was a matter of better survival. The film writes very little about the elder brother's mentality. It is more about observing the character through the younger brother's limited perspective, but this does not detract from the character's complex and deep charm. Brother is the epitome of those groups under the worst quagmire of the bottom who still try to protect important people. His death is to open up a path to light for the newborn.",Slumdog Millionaire
435,griffinfinity,Hooray for Bollywood!...,8,5 July 2009,"I love foreign films. I feel this way because storytelling comes first. If explosions, skin or violence is required to accurately tell their stories, so be it. But the story is everything in films made outside the USA. When I think of great 'story' based films, 'The Usual Suspects' (USA), 'Run Lola Run' (Germany), and 'Roshomon' (Japan) come to mind. There is only one element to these films that is similar. They all involve a recounting or revisiting of events that lead up to the finale. 'Slumdog Millionaire' belongs in this category as well.This film has the courage to go almost two-hours. The 'standard' for movies these days is 90 minutes. That's mainly because studios listen more to focus groups than directors. The same standard applied in the sixties with record releases. The cardinal rule: never go over three minutes in length. This 'wisdom' was obliterated when FM radio and 'album oriented rock' ushered in an era of unprecedented creativity. In 'Slumdog Millionaire', Writer, Simon Beaufoy, Editor, Chris Dickens, and Directors, Danny Boyle & Loveleen Tandan complimented each other in a magnificent display of ensemble work behind the scenes. The precious extra minutes were used unselfishly and gave the story room to breath, and ultimately triumph Another aspect of risk (beautifully handled here) was in seaming together multiple time periods. Many potentially excellent films are ruined as the story gets lost in the time tunnels, and confusion ensues. In 'Slumdog Millionaire', we have three characters, interpreted by nine actors. Six of them being children. Each part was brilliantly acted, and the continuity was allowed to develop clearly and naturally. Again, Directors, Danny Boyle & Loveleen Tandan were the reason it worked. They say you get what you give, and they must have been quite generous with the young cast.I would be negligent not to mention a marvelous supporting cast. Not to be outshone, the people and settings throughout were spectacular. Cinematographer, Anthony Dod Mantle, made the most of capturing an amazing country. The film was shot entirely in India. A few months before viewing 'Slumdog Millionaire' I was extremely fortunate to have seen the amazing documentary 'Story of India' on public television. I am certain that it enhanced this film for me.'Slumdog Millionaire' is funny, adventurous, cruel, dramatic and clever. Boyle and wove all of these elements into pure delight. A.R. Rahman's score set the tone for lively, dramatic and humorous sequences. At the end of the film, I felt a sigh of relief; having already known everyone mentioned in this piece was recognized for their excellence. I don't know why, but when I have experienced outstanding film making, I want everyone else to have the same chance as well. If this piece was truly headed straight to DVD, one wonders if it would have been seen at all.Much speculation has occurred in Hollywood over the connection, particularly financial, with Bollywood. But here is yet another example of something originating from outside of Hollywood that is literally defines 'world class' film making. I hope the global boundaries that are falling 'flat' in the business world take root in movies as well. Here's hoping that we can do away with the preface and just call them 'films'.",Slumdog Millionaire
436,TuFNuT,Deserving of not a Million but Billion applauses!,9,2 January 2009,"There are movies and there are movies. Some entertain while some are cinematically brilliant but lack mass appeal. And then there are some like 'Slumdog Millionaire' that transcend all barriers and manage to do both.At its very core 'Slumdog Millionaire' is a magnificent love story, which seems like a fairytale, yet it is so damn realistic and believable. We have all dreamt of the perfect romance, the kind which blossoms and gets better over time like wine. Slumdog Millionaire is living that dream on celluloid for two hours. It's about the perseverance of the protagonist, a Mumbai slum kid named Jamal portrayed brilliantly by the two child actors and Dev Patel, to unite with the love of his life  Latika, whom he met, fell in love and was separated from in the direst of circumstances.Filmed entirely in India, it captures the life, the spirit, the greatness and the follies of the nation and its people in a way, which perhaps no other foreign film has been able to. In fact the excellent production values achieved by this US-UK and Indian joint venture is something that will put many popular Indian film-makers to shame. Of course, it goes without saying that this venture would not shine without the A Grade effort of the Indian crew right from the assistant director to the lower level technicians. The soundtrack composed by A.R. Rehman is a major highlight of the movie. His brilliance in this foreign venture stands out proving that Indian artists can match the best of the best in the business. Each of Rahman's composition has the effect of cocaine injected into your blood stream.The British director, Danny Boyle is clearly the captain of the ship. Slumdog has some clear and refined shades of his other highly acclaimed movie  Trainspotting. But here Boyle outdoes that effort by perfectly understanding the essence of this Indian story, bringing out its soul, thereby brilliantly executing it. In fact, Indian film maker Madhur Bhandarkar would do well to learn a lesson or two on how not to stereo-type and play the same record again and again.Coming back to the film, the game show, 'Who Wants To Be a Millionaire' hosted by Anil Kapoor is the pivot around which the story revolves. Jamal, a chaiwala in a call center is on the verge of winning the grand prize in this popular show. But how could a chaiwala, a slum boy possibly do that? His euphoria is short lived as he is arrested on suspicion of cheating and interrogated by the police inspector played by Irrfan Khan. The story goes back and forth, with Jamaal revealing his adventurous journey with his elder brother Salim and Latika, the love of his life. The riveting tale starts from the slums of Mumbai. With a glib charm it gives us an engrossing depiction of their turbulent lives which take unanticipated turns time and again. It is commendable how brilliantly plots like the massacre of Muslims and the organized child- begging business are woven into the story. As is often the case to gain audience's sympathy for the characters, the film-makers do not resort to any emotional manipulation even in the most intense scenes. Instead, they establish a strong and resilient central character of Jamal backed up by equally powerful characters of Salim and Latika. Whenever they are in a spot of bother the viewer is rooting for them with all his heart just like in a football match when one supports a minnow against the league champion.Slumdog millionaire will uplift you to a feel good pedestal where you are less cynical and in a more positive life state. That there is a thing called DESTINY will force even the cynic to think about once he watches this. Of course, destiny always doesn't have to be as over the top as shown in Slumdog but it does exist in everybody's life and that the elements of the universe conspire for you to achieve your's.Maybe in that envelope for the 2009 Oscars there is a card where it is written : BEST MOTION PICTURE  Slumdog Millionaire.",Slumdog Millionaire
437,johnleemk,A modern fairy tale...for the ages,10,17 January 2009,"I had heard some grumbling about this movie being overrated, and until about halfway through the movie, despite enjoying myself, I was willing to give it maybe 9 stars out of 10. But then it became more than the story of a couple of kids from the slums - it became a great retelling of two ancient stories: the kid from humble beginnings who makes history, and the boy who gets the girl, loses the girl, and...well, let's not spoil it, shall we? The second half, as we see the protagonists mature, combined with the climactic finale of the game show, is easily one of the best pieces of film I have ever seen in my life.Yes, Slumdog Millionaire is incredibly unrealistic. Let's be frank, even giving generous leeway for coincidence, there is no way this could have happened. The women featured in the movie are nearly always perfectly pretty; the prominent usage of perfect English is extremely unrealistic; there is just no way Jamal's life could have worked out in such a way that he would know the right answers.But if you think this is a criticism of the film, all I can say is that I'm really quite sorry for how seriously you take yourself. Great stories are not about the real world; great stories tell us about a world that could be, and make it seem almost as real to us as the world we live in. Slumdog Millionaire is a fairy tale for the ages, and for all its unrealism, is an uplifting and inspiring story of determination, love, and destiny. While I would say that I am often too eager to cut films some slack and give them 10 out of 10 just because I enjoyed myself thoroughly watching them, I have no qualms about giving Slumdog Millionaire a perfect 10. I would give it 11 if I could. This is a movie that deserves it.A side-note on issues of realism: although I have never lived in India, I visited Kolkata for a week and the slums and way of life I saw were very similar to that depicted in the movie. I come from a multi-ethnic country with many Indians and huge income disparities; I have socialised with both the wealthy elite and the squatters living nearly hand to mouth. I can easily tell you that Slumdog Millionaire is off in many ways. But every timeless tale is not quite accurate, and I don't hear anyone ragging on Snow White or George Washington's cherry tree for their realist faux pas. Slumdog Millionaire is a beautiful story, and while I'm not sure it stands in that class, it is one of the most amazing things to have ever been filmed. Watch it.",Slumdog Millionaire
438,PyTom83,Overrated,7,11 June 2009,"It was pretty good, but the critics seemed to overrate it a bit. It just seems that every arty, substantial movie that gets made are sure to win Oscars. The cinematography and direction was great, but the story and characters was mediocre as the character development was ridiculous since the movie doesn't really show why Jamal loved Latika (let's not forget that he saw her only twice since they were kids). This was more of an obsession than real love. The only character that wasn't that two dimensional was Salim. Best directing and cinematography? Maybe, but the fact that the movie won best writing and movie is laughable. Also the little kid actors were awesome and other than that, there were better films released in 08.And are we really supposed to believe that playing for such high stakes on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, they would ask a cricket related question, in India of all places?",Slumdog Millionaire

I had read some critics and I decided to give it a try and after 2 hours I left the theatre with a mix of feelings. First of all I have to admit that If the movie had been 100% American. Meaning that actors, and scenes had been shot at any place in Europe or America the movie would have been completely forgettable. Liked or not, and in my point of view (being European) see some Indian stuff everywhere made this movie enjoyable and I'm not going to judge now if it's or not realistic.Saying that I liked the movie. Don't watch it as a masterpiece or under any big spectations cause in that case it will failed. Watch it as a fairytale based in India. With bad guys, good ones, love and almost impossible endings. The movie doesn't pretend to show us India in deep but it gives you brushes of it and that Boyle makes a really good work with the camera.The movie is predictable, indeed it is. That is not realistic, probably it is not. But it touches you. Makes you feel different feelings along the movie.

440,markymnstr,"Smart, intuitive, unpredictable and refreshing.",9,6 December 2008,"Danny Boyle goes to India. This is one helluva director who really likes to play the gamut. From ""Trainspotting"" to ""Millions"". From ""28 Days Later"" to ""Slumdog Millionaire"". The only thing any of these movies have in common is they're extraordinary works of film-making that both critics and consumers seem to love. And you won't find a blockbuster among them, and you probably never will from Mr. Boyle. But the lack of box office recognition will probably be the last thing on Boyle's mind come award season when ""Slumdog Millionaire"" predictably becomes an Academy Award sleeper. Is it that good? You betcha! The style, the substance, the tone, the story all scream wow! And all defy description. It's a heart wrenching, gut wrenching, heart tugging, heart warming, soul searching, spirit lifting, epic drama that is as much romantic as it is harrowing, as suspenseful as it is funny.Slumdog is the name attached to orphans that grow up in the human cesspool of Mumbai India that somehow manage to survive much like poly wags would in stagnant pools of waste back here in America. Against all odds. Miracle against miracle, this slumdog grows into a smart, streetwise young man, who makes it onto India's version of ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"" And...well, without spoiling the film, all I'll say is ""he doesn't."" ""Want to be a millionaire, that is."" Smart, intuitive, unpredictable and refreshing. With a Hollywood ending that's only succeeded by it's Bollywood ending. Is this one of my favorite movies of the year? You betcha!

But, on the other hand, the movie has romance, real drama, true love, hope, and -of course- suspense. In short, it has the complete recipe for a good movie, while also drawing attention to issues such as India's slum children and Police brutality. However, Danny Boyle follows a tradition set by movies such as City of God, Totsi and others in depicting life in the slums. In this aspect this movie reminds one also of other big-city slums in the world, Central Station that takes place in Sao Paolo, Man of the Year (on the slums of Rio), Totsi (South Africa), and others. The topic is popular among filmmakers, and among these, Central Station and Totsi have won Academy Awards. I would expect Slumdog Millionaire to get not only a nomination, but also an award. The story is very good, the acting, direction and cinematography are also excellent and in all these aspects the movie is flawless. The only problem I had was with the sound, it was excessively loud for the small theater I watched the movie in.",Slumdog Millionaire
444,vince_cadena,One of the best films of the year,10,5 November 2008,"Danny Boyle has been a favorite of mine since I saw Shallow Grave, since then he's gone on to make three masterpieces(Trainspotting,28 Days Later and Millions), a near perfect film(Sunshine) a guilty pleasure(The Beach) and a total miss(A Life Less Ordinary). Slumdog Millionaire comes out of nowhere and it could very well be his best film and one of the best films of the decade. Visually like Boyles previous work it's stunning, Apocalypse Now and City of God come to mind and there are dutch angles galore. The raw style mixed with the amazing locations make this film one of the most cinematic experiences you'll ever see. The Sound is perfect, I haven't heard audio like this in a while. This film needs a Sound Oscar nomination, it sounds that good. I went into seeing this knowing very little about it and the person I took with me didn't know anything about it, so I'll just say it's about a young man that goes on Indias Who Wants to be a Millionaire, it's a very unconventional film where they tell the story of his life in flashbacks while he plays the game. It's funny, sad, thrilling, basically a very enjoyable film that deserves numerous Oscar nominations. Also the lead actress is one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen, if she isn't a huge star after this I'd be extremely surprised. If the academy doesn't honor this film with numerous nominations it will be a shame but this film will be studied in 20 years and whoever sees this will love it, so even if it doesn't get a single nomination it won't matter. Don't miss this film, it's perfect!",Slumdog Millionaire
445,rishi_is_here-1,Excellent but perhaps not for weak hearts,10,25 January 2009,"Slumdog is not a movie for all and specially not for those Indians who love to watch Bollywood romantic movies with all are beautiful and nice things around. It is a film depicting hard realities of slum side of India. These genre of movies even made by Indian directors were never popular amongst general Indian audience as poverty and hard realities of life don't attract people who live inside or around it. So they like to hide in their own world and get entertained by with masala bollywood movies. It is no wonder why it has created so much controversies in India and Indian audience has been splitted up into two groups, one group doesn't like to portray India with its poverty to the outside world, another group is not ambivalent of accepting harder side of poor India. The difference in opinions will continue to be there and even if this movie gets Oscars(till this writing it has got 10 Oscar nominations) many will sniff on this movie saying this is westerners way of defaming India's prosperity. Well, my opinion is accept this great movie as one of the masterpieces and take movie in movie's spirit. There are few of my western friends who also couldn't like the movie. For all of them, take the spirit out of movie and be wondered how an ordinary kid can touch the sky with favour of destiny, also I must add it is nice to be surrounded by wealth and comforts but please do remember you are one of those very tiny lucky percent of population in this earth who can dream of be well-off. If you think this movie is disgusting then thank god that you are lucky and not born like Jamal Malik of this movie. Living in a glasshouse amongst nice paintings on the wall may make you happy but perhaps it is wiser to look through the glass also sometimes to make yourself with a stronger heart. Coming back to the movie, Danny Boyle's best compilation so far added to the flavour excellent tight script , good acting and cinematography and what a Rehman's spell in the musical section. Like I said above if you have a strong heart to see poverty and reality of developing countries then go and watch and be part of the league of real movie lovers.",Slumdog Millionaire

450,thebackofmyhouse,"They are right, it actually is a masterpiece",9,8 January 2009,"Slumdog Millionaire not one of those movies that gets critical acclaim for it's great acting, or eyeball exploding special effects, or any of those award show categories. It is great because it does what movies do, and does it in an almost perfect way. It takes the everyday Joe's fantasy, put it in film form, and make anybody who watches it live the fantasy, even if just for 2 hours.Right from the get go the movie pulls you in. It's not one of those slow burning movies. The movie tells about this kid from the slums of India, who goes on the Who Wants To Be A Millionaire gameshow and reaches the final question. They ran out of time before the final question is asked so they have to continue the next day. The police find it hard to believe a slum kid can answer all those questions so they interrogate him and he tells how he got to know the answers. In telling it, he practically tells his life story. And he has been through a lot. So it shows how he knows the answer to the first question from events from he was a kid, up to the answer to the penultimate question from events just moments before being asked the question itself. However, it is rather convenient that in the movie, the events that lead to him knowing the answers to each question in the gameshow is in the same chronological order to the chronology of the questions that are asked on the gameshow. But hey, it's a movie and I'm not complaining. One of the things that sets this movie apart is how it shows India. This ain't your Bollywood India. It's the slums and how people go about their lives living there. Some scenes are harsh but at the same time, this is not one of those dark and gritty movies either. It actually is a feel good movie. Sure there are some hard reality shown in the movie but overall the movie is overwhelmingly feel good. It's so feel good that you can consider it to be Bollywood in a way. And that's why this movie is almost perfect. Everything was going perfectly in the movie, but how they wrapped it all up in the end seemed too Bollywood for me. Sure it's feel good, and I admit I did feel good, but I prefer my feel good endings have a bit more believability.But why am I arguing about believability when I'm an everyday Joe and I had an excellent 2 hours. Plus, the music is great too.",Slumdog Millionaire
451,alerter,some of the cool stuff Danny Boyle disclosed in Q&A about Slumdog Millionaire,10,29 December 2008,"I attended the San Francisco screening on Danny Boyle's b-day, where he participated in a follow-on Q&A. My impression of Boyle is that he is genuinely down-to-earth, culturally sensitive/astute and an exceedingly humble person. It is equally apparent, from everything we see in this film and come to feel, that Boyle possesses a seething passion about film making and a genius for story telling. These all infuse every frame of this film. The film is powerful and moving, with seamless performances by all three sets of actors portraying the three lead characters. There's also a who's who of Bollywood heavy weights in pitch perfect supporting roles. Two of the three youngest players were cast straight out of the Bombay/Mumbai slums. This casting choice then necessitated that all of the scenes involving the first trio of Jamal, Salim and Latika would have to be entirely in Hindi. Fearless as ever, non-Hindi speaking Boyle turned to his India casting agent, Loveleen Tandan, to direct the Hindi-only speaking actors. Boyle directly credits Tandan for the verisimilitude of the children's' performances and he gladly elevated her to the title of co-director, in recognition of Tandan's and the children's numerous original contributions. I love what was done with the subtitles, too. (The bone crushing poverty and pervasive corruption that exists in Bombay/Mumbai is a harsh reality. It is something that Boyle says has to be accepted for what it is, with compassion, but also without pity. At the end of one shooting day, one of the principal child actors went home, only to discover that the government had dissolved that particular ghetto that same day. Production staff then had to search high and low, across Bombay/Mumbai, to locate the family and reunite them. Then the next day dawned. There are many more stories about these real life children, too.) I never read Vikas Swarup's Q and A; but I take Boyle's word that the book, as written, would be impossible to film. Tremendous credit has to be given to Simon Beaufoy's brilliantly loose screenplay adaptation. It is a feat that withstands direct comparisons with The English Patient and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, for grasping the essence of an original and then lovingly taking it into the stratosphere. Boyle has a deep cultural and artistic appreciation for Bombay/Mumbai and Bollywood's traditions, yet he lensed the story with a respectful Western eye. Suketu Mehta's book Maximum City - Bombay Lost and Found, served as a production bible, and was referred to just as much as the script. (One can only hope that if Mehta finally ever options his book for film that Boyle will get a real crack at making it.) Where ever there were scenes in Beaufoy's script that could be taken as being sacrilegious, creative adjustments were made. One specific example given was the appearance of Rama, which was supposed to have been represented on a t-shirt, but was, instead, turned into a quasi-magical-realism vision/appearance during the Muslim-Hindu riot scene. Not only was this change culturally sensitive, it was vastly more striking. The love story, between Jamal and Latika, is one of Beaufoy's story inventions. Given three sets of actors portraying Jamal and Latika, there is so much that could go wrong with this central and interrupted thread of the story. The seed of love first has to become apparent, then its shoots must bud and become Jamal's quest. No part of this can be sappy, if this is to hold together. Before I saw SM, I had no idea how much of a romantic Boyle is and, at the same time, he is also one who does not wear his heart on his sleeve. You just have to see the film to know what I mean by that. I don't care what any of Dev Patel's detractors have to say about any of his work prior to SM. All I know is what I saw in SM where Patel's Jamal went toe-to-toe and scene-for-scene with Bollywood Royalty, and he acquitted himself decorously as leading man. Boyle also resorted to some special technical innovations. The spectacular scenes running through the Bombay ghettos were captured using a pole mounted camera/lens, tethered to a MacBook (in a backpack) serving as DVR. In addition, the MacBook had to be cooled using slabs of dry ice. This allowed the camera operator to ""roll"" in the midst of all the action. Dry ice had to be cached along the way, in so many locations, that there were surreal swirling clouds of CO2 ""smoke"" seeping from the various hiding places. Boyle's crew also lost access to the Taj Mahal before all of the shots were completed. In a brilliant move, the DP armed an alternate camera crew with a Canon EoS camera and used it, in rapid frame mode, to pick up all of the remaining Taj Mahal shots. If no one had told me, I would not have known the difference. And neither, apparently, did Taj Mahal security. I've seen this film three times already and cannot wait for the DVD to come out. If it's handled correctly, there will be hours of bonus features. One the one hand, there is so much to enjoy, in terms of pure entertainment. On the other hand, there are so many engaging stories about the making of this masterpiece. Finally, I am deeply torn, this year, because I love both SM and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and they are both squarely in the category of adapted screenplay. I love SM for its dense compactness and I love tCCoBB for its sprawling expansiveness. Might it be possible for tie votes to win, in more than one category? The magical realism of the two gives me reason to hope.",Slumdog Millionaire
452,ymsyctai,Overrated but good... far from great,5,7 January 2012,"Overrated but good... far from greatThis movie is more like a 6/10 or 7/10 max but I had to give it a 5/10 just because you know people are giving this flick a 10/10 without really thinking about it. Don't get me wrong, it is a good movie and actually original which and in itself is impressive but still overrated. The acting was good and the storyline is OK but my problem with this movie is that it ignores it's surroundings and the flow is funky. It is a funky type of movie but that doesn't mean you have to have sporadic jumps and pauses that jumble up the flow and pacing of the movie. And when I say the acting is good I mean the acting of the lead kid. In fact his acting is outstanding and helps to carry the movie but the others are notably flat or wide-eyed. Maybe the director was banking on the kid holding the movie together and luck for us he was able to do it but still the director should have known better. Maybe that is why 127 hours was so good, because the film maker can direct only one guy at a time? Who knows?",Slumdog Millionaire

Finally, the flashbacks happen in logical relations to the plot, and each of them is interesting and further explains the back story of the characters. The only problem I had was with the ending, which was too happy for my taste.Other features that make Slumdog Millionaire such a good movie are the music along with the cinematography. The camera angles are used very wisely to capture the feeling of the characters. Furthermore, the music is very engaging and further improves the sense of each scene. However, the final dancing and singing sequence seemed too tacky to me, but I believe it is a substantial feature in many Bollywood movies.In conclusion, this movie feeds you happiness by the spoon, which can either lift your spirit or make you sick; however, it is an excellent film that I would recommend.",Slumdog Millionaire
454,chirag_shah775,good movie but Real India?,7,15 January 2009,"this movie was good...Great direction, acting, music and cinematography...but let me ask something..Did it show real India? What is real India? This film was about the harsh life in the slums and about one kid who goes from rags to riches. When people see a film about the Indian slums they label it ""Real India""...So is growing India, ""second fastest growing economy"" India the ""Fake India""? That is also real isn't it? It's really happening Isn't it? So why is it that the dirty, smelly corrupt India is labeled the ""real India""...Don't get me wrong... It was a well made film, but also a bit one-sided with the whole ""Real India"" aspect. Especially that one scene when the kid is beaten near the taj mahal by the cops and these Americans come up to the kid...The Kid says ""This is real India""...Then the Great American says, ""This is REAL America"" so she gives his $100. So basically the director is saying that real America is positive, beautiful and cultured while real India is disgusting, violent and poor...Is that one-sided or not? What I am saying is that every country has it's positives and negatives. This film successfully showed the dark side of the country but there was no point in adding ""Real India"" because that indicated the fact that India is ONLY the way it is depicted in the film. India has Rich and Poor and BOTH are part of the ""Real India"".",Slumdog Millionaire
455,dineshvasudevan2003,Excellent and engaging Movie,10,24 January 2009,"Words cannot describe the beauty of this movie. It starts with a curse and ends with a dance/song. The journey that a boy makes from being a Slumdog to a millionaire is the plot as the title suggests. But it is not only that. It shows the conditions of the slums in Bombay, what children have to suffer being a part of that and how they are exploited by people. There are moments in the movie which just stick in your mind. Like the scene when young Jamal falls into a pit full of poop and arises to see Amitabh Bachan. The scene when a young boy is made to learn and sing 'Oh Lord Ghanashyama' written by the famous poet Surdas and then getting his eyes amputated was one of the most gripping scenes of the movie. Salim pulling a revolver to kill a mob king was another excellent scene.Several factors of the Mumbai slums, like the Hindu- Muslim riots, child labor and prostitution were shown in the movie with great art. I also thought that Anil Kapoor and Irrfan Khan did great justice to the roles given to them. The ending was some what that of a typical Indian movie. A R Rehman was at his best with the background scores and he clearly deserves an Oscar.A movie I feel has to show exactness and must be entertaining when showing it. It must have a moral/study and must teach the audience a thing or two. This movie has it. It shows that destiny is something that is made by an individual and not the society that he lives in. His fate is chosen by him, by the way he chooses to live his life. This movie is a must see.",Slumdog Millionaire

The movie is an fantastic mix of action, adventure, comedy, drama and romance. The story is uniquely told in flashback as Jamal must reveal how he knew the Who wants to be a millionaireshow's answers. For instance, he knew who was on a U.S. hundred-dollar bill from when he was stealing from tourists and posing as a phony tour guide. The story of Jamal, his brother and Latika is so engaging that even the police chief questioning him wants to know what happens next in the story.The acting is awesome, both as Jamal is a young boy, a teenager and as a young man. There is much empathy with him, though especially as a young man his actions speak more than his expressions or words. The directing is terrific, telling the story in a unique way but without drawing attention to itself. The music is fun and lively, and there is the necessary ""Bollywood-style"" dance number over the end credits 😂Director Danny Boyle is also a favourite of mine with ""Trainspotting"" on my all-time 10-top list. Also ""Shallow Grave"" and ""28 Days Later"" are masterpieces.",Slumdog Millionaire
457,ajmelck,this film is all in capital letters and it makes me like e.e. cummings more than i used to,6,30 March 2009,"I went into this film with high expectations based on friends' ratings, but came out feeling slightly knocked about and empty, as if I too had suffered at the hands of the Mumbai constabulary. I'd like to emphasise though that my problem with the film was not its fable-like narrative - the sketchy, inconsistent and unexplained nature of events and the refusal to explain was rather a strength for me. Rather, it was the overall style and the compulsion to take the symmetries of plot and circumstance (which are a standard part of almost any narrative) and supercharge these to the extent that they become big signs screaming LOOK AT ME! I'M AN ECHO OF A PREVIOUS/PARALLEL SCENE!!! Due to this overworked mechanism, the film lost me at its ""climax"", the point at which one brother wins 20 million rupees and the other brother is simultaneously gunned to death in a bathtub full of banknotes. Up to that point I had been quite happy to coast along on the Lonely Planet aesthetic of penury and picaresque, but after that it was a lost cause. It didn't even matter that the music was by a Singalese girl from West London (M.I.A.), or that Danny Boyle's aggressive jump-cut style turned every conflagration into a wheeze and a romp. But the bathful of money was the point where I pulled out the plug and started to wonder: does this film say anything useful about India? Or even about ""Who wants to be a Millionaire""? Has it got anything to say at all other than slums are bad, crooks are bad, and ""true love conquers all?""A good film should reflect its age and say something about its main subject at least. But this one simply throws its boundless energy at a topic that begs for some sinuousness, intelligence and subtlety. For god's sake, it doesn't have to be La Dolce Vita, but a palette that includes something other than VERY BRIGHT and VERY DARK would have been welcome.

I really think that the movie industry needed that one special film to push for awards season and Slumdog was a safe bet. The film wasn't nearly as gritty and dramatic as City of God (and I was told that it would be) and all in all, I expected a little bit more out of Danny Boyle (Trainspotting, 28 Days Later, Shallow Grave). There were more than a few plot holes that I guess every movie critic that saw the film decided to ignore (like how the heck does he actually get onto the show?). Also, Sri Lankan rapper M.I.A.'s music is terrible for the film and sounds kind of corny when played in context with some of the scenes. I mean, let's face it: ""Paper Planes"" was old the minute the first screening of the Pineapple Express trailer was finished; and Slumdog Millionaire plays this particular song like three different times in the film.

462,amitaishwaryajogi,Why it Works?,9,15 February 2009,"For millions like me raised on a staple-diet of commercial Hindi cinema, there's nothing particularly novel about its plot: the relatively lukewarm response it has gotten from Indian film-goers compared to the rapturous applause elsewhere is proof of this. Its rags-to-riches tale, adapted from a novel penned by a diplomat, could well be a cinematic-metaphor for India's own rise during the period in which Salim, Jamal and Latika's lives unfold. In so many ways, it is the story of India as well as those of us who have lived here through the tumultuous past two decades. Its phenomenal rules-breaking success- to paraphrase the longtime film-critic, Roger Ebert- therefore owes equally if not more to the disenchanted times the world suddenly finds itself thrust into as it does to the movie's delightful intrinsic-charm: after all, what better medicine than a good healthy dose of unbridled Hope wrapped in wondrously uplifting Jai-hos to cure the globe of its seemingly insurmountable Recession-blues? All the other films nominated for Best Picture at this year's Oscars reflect the Gloom around- but also, within- us; none with the solitary exception of this film offers a way-out: even- or, especially- if the way-out is an implausibly exhilaratingly happy ending. And that is precisely what makes it work.I leave you with this particular mise-en-scene: as Jamal weaves his way through Mumbai's reptilian traffic to answer that one last remaining two million-rupee question, a wrinkly old beggar knocks at his car-window. Thinking she has come to ask for money he ignores her at first only to be confronted with the realization that she doesn't want his money at all; on the contrary, she wants him to win it all. Beta, she beams to Jamal as he is driven away, jeet ke aana. (Son, win & come.) His victory, after all, would be hers as well.

And whatever it is that it falls short of, it's more than compensated for by its overflowing vitality and panache.This movie simply was mesmerizing,. slumdog millionaire is the visual equivalent of a mouth-watering dessert. An inundation of flavors, arresting and enslaving like an incipient addiction. The cinematography is so good you forget that what is being shown are images of squalor, poverty, harassment and violence.

Everything just fits together nicely and effortlessly in this one.Jamal Malik is an 18 year old Call Center agent in Mumbai, orphaned by a bloody riot in their destitute neighborhood, --(where the police is more interested in gambling than in peace and order)-- joins the popular game show ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire."" Jamal Malik, minimally educated and a slumdog (from the slums), was able to answer each and every question in the game and by the end of the show managed to get to the very last question for a whopping 20,000,000 rupees. The show's host is outraged and becomes suspicious of Jamal, he calls the police to detain Jamal and interrogate and torture him for his ""presumed"" methods of cheating.... only, Jamal didn't cheat, and he isn't a genius either,. from the interrogation in the police station Jamal narrates to his captors how he knew of the answers--Each and every question in the game represents an episode in his life, these were not book-knowledge, or school lectures, but life experiences that had a rather unusual connection to the game's questions...So by the end of the game, we will have known Jamal's life, family, love and his real motivation for joining the show.",Slumdog Millionaire
466,jk8n,Extreme Cruelty,5,23 December 2008,"I was really looking forward to this movie based on the reviews, and made my two teenage sons go with me. I had to leave after 30 minutes. It was so cruel and vicious I just couldn't sit through one more act of inhumanity against children. If you thought Trainspotting was rough to take, it's nothing compared to Slumdog Millionaire. I loved Trainspotting in spite of the violence, but this movie was just relentless. I've seen much more effective depictions of the victimization of children in India, and the civil war between Hindu and Muslim, without resorting to MTV-style artistic violence. Danny Boyle, the director of both films, did a masterful job of using violence to make his point in Trainspotting; in Slumdog Millionaire I wondered whether he was actually getting off on it. Unless you have a really strong stomach and don't have a problem watching children treated like cockroaches, give it a miss. I feel certain you won't be missing much.",Slumdog Millionaire

469,muditmonfils,Awesome!,10,23 January 2009,"Slumdog Millionaire opens the rotten face of India, does it? Does it show the so called ""dirty underbelly"" of India? Slumdog word is racist as alleged by a chap from Bihar. But really?? If I had one word to describe these comments it would have been a *beep*!!By no means this movie is aimed at showing the chronic poverty of our nation. Many reviewers have criticized this movie for showing only the dirty reality of the country instead of displaying all those swanky buildings, glittering malls etc.Slumdog Millionaire narrates a story of 2 siblings & a girl, who rise from the dirty slum life and move into different directions of life. The older brother (""Salim""-played by Madhur Mittal) ends up working for a gangster, the girl (""Latika""-played by Frieda Pinto) ends up as a show girl with the same gangsters and the hero of the movie the younger brother (""Jamal""-played by Dev Patel) ends up living a rather straight life as a tea server in a call center. Jamal reaches the ""hot seat"" of Kaun Banega Crorepati hosted by an arrogant quiz master Prem Kumar (Anil Kapoor) who don't want him to win the game. He calls the police to get Jamal Malik arrested on the charges of fraud at the end of day 1 of the show. At the police station Jamal is tortured first by the sound thrashing from Constable Srinivas (Saurabh Shukla) and then he is subjected to electric shock, all to make him speak about how a tea serving slum dweller can give the correct answers.The movie revolves around the dingy slums of Dharavi. The heaps and heaps of garbage, dogs with flees, young Jamal jumping in a pit full of *beep* (*sic*), Hindu-Muslim riots, pimps, gangsters, rough language is some of the few characteristics of the film which together with the superb cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantle makes it an ultra realistic movie. Kudos to the director Danny Boyle and co-director Loveleen Tandon for the impressive direction and superb camera takes which shows the minutest of the details of the dirty slum life. The screenplay was outstanding.Acting:If I had to rate the performance of the characters I would surely give a high five to the children artists of the movie. Almost half of the movie shows them and their acting was very natural and realistic. Dev Patel was fine too. Frieda Pinto didn't had too much of the screen time but delivered good performance. Anil Kapoor was cool. Irrfan Khan as the deadly cop together with Saurabh Shukla gave the top performances together with the child artists. Mahesh Manjrekar was looking a real gangster. He was rough, bad and whatever you may call a gangster. Madhur Mittal as the older brother Salim was quite good.Sound/Music: Well the music has so many nominations for the Oscars what more can I write!!??!! The sound effects were superb. The background score was creepy good. ""Jai Ho"" track comes at the end of the movie. The song is classic but I doubt whether it would take away the Oscar. Let's hope for the best. A.R Rahman proves that he is the best in this field!The movie has been given an ""A"" certificate and rightly so. It has some good amount of strong language, violence in the form of riots, torture, a child being blinded with hot syrup (something), murder and other such things happening in the slums. These violent scenes are quite chilling and tense.Overall I would recommend this movie to every person who has a tag ""Indian"" attached to him/her. A detailed insight into the murky life of slum dwellers. Slumdog Millionaire is one of those movies which has a happy ending. And out of the 10 Oscar nominations it would bag at least three i.e in ""cinematography"", ""editing"" & for the song ""Jai Ho"". It is a perfect edge of the seat thriller wrapped in the ghostly realities of slums. Hightly recommended.",Slumdog Millionaire

(""City of God"" with Patrick Swayze is a close second, though.) I made my teen sons watch because they are studying Asia in school, but I'll bet they don't teach content like this! With India emerging as a global economic player, it is evident there is much room for improvement in areas of human rights, and this film says it all (and then some). Totally heartbreaking, very violent, quite moving -- we were glued to the screen. I can only hope that Danny Boyle and the writers were exaggerating some of the more horrific injustices.",Slumdog Millionaire
471,Tom-But,"Rags to riches, Mumbai-style",10,6 September 2010,"In an age of over-done and unoriginal productions, what remains a shining beacon of hope for today's contemporary theatre-goer are fresh screenplay writers like Simon Beaufoy, who offer a diversity in set-in- stone film genres and proceed to mix them up, evoke their underlying significance and define a far more secular and appreciative medium. Slumdog Millionaire is such a film, and one fortunate enough to fall into the hands of eccentrically versatile director Danny Boyle (Trainspotting, 28 Days Later), whose pragmatic approach to filmmaking is thankfully matched by his avant-garde visual techniques, and daring cinematographer Anthony Don Mantle (also a contributor to 28 Days Later), a rare talent who brings his locations to life, presenting them not only as settings but separate characters, as central to the plot as the actors.An exercise in the concepts of ever-lasting love, true knowledge and, quite suitably above all else, destiny, Slumdog is a film made to please and does so resoundingly without even considering to cheat the viewer. This legitimacy is most clear in the hazardous and unstable (not by choice) relationship that is the affection between the main character Jamal and his child-hood love Latika. Leading an eventful and not altogether pleasant existence in poverty-stricken Mumbai, Jamal is searching for the elusive Latika (kidnapped by an extortionist of child ""performers"") and appears on the Indian syndicate of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? so as to indicate to her his whereabouts.After approximately a decade of searching, Jamal is still compelled to seek his long-lost love and simply be with her, by any means necessary. And the audience will choose to believe Jamal could remain this dedicated, despite the odds, after such a length of time. They are not forced to believe it out of pressure from the plot's consistency, but instead accept it by choice and, what's more, care about both the characters, in part due to the emotionally overwhelming chemistry between actors Patel and Pinto (Jamal and Latika, respectively). Filmmaking at its best struggles to achieve this sincerity.It is also quite refreshing to witness a film that acknowledges a life of such adversity as Jamal's as not only something that hardens one's character and strengthens moral fibre, but also incurs the obtainment of true knowledge. Of course, this is represented cryptically by Jamal's ability to answer a random assortment of questions that by chance (or fate) he knows the answers to, but the symbolism of his pure, raw intelligence is not lost, especially during a scene in which he answers a question about the location of a district in London not based on any formerly gained information but simply through the application of logic. Ultimately, however, Slumdog Millionaire is a film that is established on the premise of fate and the ideal notion that if it is meant to be, then ""it is written."" To this reasoning, it is inevitable that Jamal and Latika will wind up together in each others' arms, their quests fulfilled, their undying love satisfied etc. But while the audience may never truly doubt this will be the film's conclusion, all of the misfortune and hardship that precedes it compels the viewer to hope for it all the more.The underlying beauty and clarity of one of the closing scenes of Slumdog is arguably the film's strongest moments, in which Jamal is asked the final question. He doesn't know the answer, to everyone's surprise and so uses his remaining life-line to call his brother Salim, who happens to be working for the man who has kidnapped Latika. Conveniently enough (in the least cynical sense possible) while watching Jamal's run of good luck, Salim encounters a change of heart and allows Latika to escape with his phone. And so she answers After having an intimate albeit brief discussion with Latika, during which she supplied no answer to the final question (but speaks the words ""I am yours"" in Hindi), Jamal is once more asked to answer the question. He chooses A ""A because?"" ""Just A because A.""Then something unexpected happens: Jamal is right! What the viewer might assume would be forfeited in the place of love becomes in reality an additional gain. He wins the grand prize of 20 million rupees, and the entire country goes wild. The rags to riches story has finally come true; they have witnessed the rebirth of a slumdog, and no-one could be happier. Even the film's audience will feel a sense of euphoria at this unanticipated victory. The only person, in fact, who couldn't care less is Jamal. The celebration surrounding him, the studio audience cheering his name and the game show host dancing, Jamal is simply staring into space, a discreet smile on his lips, thinking only of Latika.The next immediate scene is Jamal sitting by himself at a train station, dressed in a plain shirt with raggedy jeans and with no briefcase or over-sized cheque about his person. One can only expect (or hope) that maybe straight after the previous scene, while the festivity was still rife around him and everyone was too excited to notice, perhaps Jamal simply stood up, walked around his chair over to the studio door, looked once over his shoulder, smiled and walked out. I'd like that.(Final Note: The Bollywood-esquire dance scene during the final credits, to the award-winning original song ""Jai Ho"" by A. R. Rahman and choreographed by Longinus Fernandes, is kick-ass! Is time perhaps for the introduction of Best Choreography at the Academy?)",Slumdog Millionaire
472,zendyude,"Horrid, racist movie",1,7 November 2012,"This movie had no soul. It comes from the mind of a very sick, depressed and sadistic individual aka Danny Boyle. His ambition in this movie was to show India and Indians in a bad light, which is not the reality at all as it portrays. There are many layers to Indian society, and being a complex and sophisticated culture, the layers are equally complex. All said and done, even these poorest of slum 'dogs' live happier and culturally rich lives than most millionaires in the west. This is the spiritual aspect which Boyle lacked the depth or the intention to portray.There was this one scene in the movie where the boy is stealing tires from the car of an American tourist couple, and when caught, he tells them: ""This is the real India"", and the Americans give him $100 as say: ""This is some real America for you"". I mean how cheesy is that? Clearly Boyle was trying to patronize the American audience and awards' judges.

However, the boy is arrested for suspicion of an injustice, because he grew up in the slum area in India, and he cannot know the answers. In this story, his growth becomes clear by the examination from the police. This movie draws the present and the past of young people in Mumbai. It is unnatural that he is arrested and tortured, but in this city, it is a reality. A gap-widening society, child abuse, religious disturbances appear in this movie. These problems in India are not familiar for me, so I cannot take my eye off the movie. There are a lot of truths which we have to consider. This movie is also moving.

Well, since Oscars aren't won by TV programs, I understood that this wasn't the case.Right after the movie session started, and the first musics started to play. I felt in love for the soundtrack. The last time I felt this attracted by a movie's soundtrack was in ""Juno""s movie.Then, I really got involved with all history and, the movie's capacity of showing both sides of India.

Like, I still doubt it but, is it really true they cripple kids so that they look more believable when they go ask for money?? It shocked me.In overall, I loved the movie.

Jamal gets a spot on ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire."" There are lots of questions, 1st is how can someone with such little education from the slums of Mumbai even answer 1 question on this game show, let alone ALL! For me the question is how does a child of the slums know enough written and spoken English to answer these questions? The 1st question is answered as the movie progresses. Each question is a flash-back into his childhood where he is able to find the ""Millionaire"" answer as the host of the show mocks him. The 2nd question has yet to be answered, or thought about? Be it as it may, there is a ""witch"" that gathers up hungry stray children unknowingly and brings them to a dark forest far away and feeds them well. The brothers are able to figure this captivity as dangerous and escape and the story goes on from there, continuing to meet the challenges of survival. The ""witch"" too continues to haunt them (at least Jamal is able to keep at arms length away, his brother not so) and Jamal ends up on ""Millionaire."" This movie deserved every award they received.

477,RickBrands,No Top 250 material.,6,1 April 2009,"Overly sentimental, anything but credible and ridiculously over-hyped, this petty excuse of a movie managed to reel in a multitude of Oscars. I have to admit I wasn't exactly bored while watching it, but a second viewing just isn't going to happen.The storyline's a wash - to name just one inconsistency, as Salman Rushdie pointed out: from Bombay to the Taj Mahal by jumping a train? Really? -, the actors don't bring anything truly endearing or sympathetic to their characters, and the 'award-winning' music is more often a nuisance than an extra to the whole movie-going experience. Don't get me wrong: I love M.I.A., for instance, but for the biggest part it just didn't work for me.In fact, the only virtues of this film are the often astonishing landscapes, the energetic, yet dynamic camera work and the rhythmic, punctual direction. But you simply cannot make a good movie out of those three elements - except if you wanna go all 'Koyaanisqatsi', which I love. But they didn't.Hence: six out of ten.P.S.: To be completely honest, I would probably rate this a seven, seven and a half tops if it weren't for the suffocating hype surrounding the film, but I feel like bringing the overall score down a notch in my own humble way, because 'Slumdog' simply doesn't deserve such a high rating.

481,pierrefonds_athlete101,'Slumdog' is pretty much 'Rocky' in India,10,15 February 2009,"There is 'The Dark Knight' that everyone was hoping would be nominated for best picture this year. After looking at all the picks, I only saw Benjamin Button which was the film I was once rooting for best picture this year. After seeing this movie last night, I changed my mind and now I'm rooting for 'Slumdog Millionaire'. The film has much hope for a big win at the Oscars just as much as what people are feeling when they are watching Dev Patel try to win 20,000,000 rupees not just for himself but for the one he loves named Latika and his escape out of a dark world ruled by slum lords.'Slumdog' is pretty much 'Rocky' in India. Rocky (1976) is a poor man doing loan shark work in America. Dev Patel's well realized portrayal as Jamal Malik is also a poor young man in India acting as an assistant to a phone company. Rocky gets the million to one shot to face boxer Apollo Creed. Jamal gets the one chance in a lifetime that many others want which is to compete in ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"" Therefore this film is seen as one of the films to root for making Jamal one of the greatest protagonists in film history. I would say he is a much better hero than AFI's #1 Atticus Finch in ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" (1962).Danny Boyle and Loveleen Tandan's direction is superb. The setting shows a lot of symbols. The set helps make the audience see why it is necessary for Jamal to win the show. Chris Dickens editing is also an achievement because I have not seen a style of editing like his compared to the group of people who edited 'Any Given Sunday'. Even though the editing of 'Any Given Sunday' movie was not nominated for an Oscar, it was still amazing. Academy awards on this film is well deserved. Of course like any other person who writes a review, I am going to have to say if you liked any of the best picture nominations, liked 'City of God' and 'Rocky', I would strongly suggest that you see this film.

485,user-28221,"Oh! Poor Danny, not again...",4,9 February 2009,"Please, please tell me why so many of you people love this piece of crap?! It will probably take my entire life to figure it out! I'm gonna tell you the reason why I still gave it a 4. It's the ambition, the ambition of Danny to make a different movie, which is obvious if only you see half of the movie. The difference lies in the storytelling. A boy reveals his life by explaining to the suspicious policemen why he, an uneducated slumdog boy, managed to win amazingly great money that no one ever did in the history of the program Who Wanna Be The Millionaire. Deservedly it is great storytelling. Yet a great storytelling alone is never enough to make a great movie.Remember the excitement we had after we saw Pulp Fiction? Was the excitement purely out of the outstanding storytelling? Certainly not, we love the storytelling because it is combined with shining acting, fascinating music, deep ideas, and solid ending. The storytelling is just a skeleton, and the other things make the flesh. How beautiful can a great skeleton be if there is little decent flesh on it? Pulp Fiction is strong both inside and outside, however, Slumdog Millionaire, just has a nice outside.Before I saw Slumdog Millionaire, many people told me it is the Indian version of City Of God, and I felt even more excited when I found its director is Danny. But after I saw it, I was completely disappointed. Because Danny did the stupid thing again! After his greatest movie Trainspotting, this guy seemed have turned to someone nobody can recognize. Look at 28 days later, it could have been a milestone if he had added a unique idea for it; The Beach, great acting and story, but the ending, so so disgustingly stupid... You will easily fall in love with these two movies if you see the first half only... Why Danny, why always lack a little bit to be great? Slumdog Millionaire has the same and new problems. The end is as meaningless as The Beach; the lack of ideas is inherited from 28 Days Later. And the new problems this time are terrible! The music is sick; the whole plot is very very far-fetched and unnatural: how did the two characters fall in love; this is a movie talking about things in India, and it is honorably compared with City Of God because they are both about the crime and violence in the worst places of the world(India and Brazil), however, if you wanna introduce something violent and horrifying, you should do it in a violent and horrifying way. So many people that like this movie say Slumdog Millionaire is the City Of God without blood. That just doesn't make any sense! If there is no blood, it's not India at all!!!I almost lost my faith in Oscar when I saw it gave so many nominations to Slumdog Millionaire but not The Dark Knight and The Wrestler...

But then, its a story about the slums and we have a lot of them. I will not say that these kind of things never happens in India. It do happen. There are murders, prostitution, begging, and money involved in all these, but still we have a civilized section too. People who watch Slumdog Millionaire have to keep one thing in mind that...

This film explodes with narrative force and is undoubtedly one of the best films of 2008. Oscar-winning worthy or not, this film mixed the English directing of Danny Boyle with the Indian setting and feel very well. The acting furthermore is very good with the slumdog kids (actually young kids from the slums of India) stealing the show with their intense sequences in the first half of the film. The gradual growing up of the three children depicted in this film show the cruelties of life in the slums and the different paths the unknowing kids get bought into.

It won 8 Academy Awards, the most for its year, to no surprise.The story takes place in three points in time: Jamal's childhood, his experience in the game show in the recent present, and the present with his interrogation. Somewhat reasonably enough, those involved with the millionaire show suspect Jamal of cheating; how else can an uneducated 18-year-old man from Mumbai answer all of the questions perfectly?Slumdog Millionaire concerns Jamal's journey from a cheery boy of around 5 to the young man he has become, from his life in the slums to whatever future he will have. You see how he struggles to survive with his older brother, Selim, who sees life in quite a different way than he does; and how their relationship slowly withers as certain events occur.What I took from this film? That life in the slums of India is terrible and something should be done about it; that with work, anyone can earn money to make a living; that hope never dies; that love is beautiful; that ""it is written.""

489,ande8162,A fairytale for adults: $1 million solves all problems,8,22 December 2008,"This is a great film, it pulses with life, music, and culture, but the majority of its greatness can be seen in the first hour. I tried my best to avoid the hype, maybe I waited too long, maybe I'm part of the 'backlash,' but I would like to think this would have been my reaction even if I'd seen it sooner. The first half has it all. Laugh-out-loud comedy becomes devastating tragedy leading to grand adventure all across India. It's magic, you are right there in the slums, the game show set, the train, but the illusion begins to wear off at about midpoint as things begins to flow, inevitably, toward an ending where everything will come together and be right. Stories can do this while still maintaining tension, and the finale of this film does have its tense moments, but it also loses a lot of steam. I get that it's a fairytale, and this is one of the great modern day fairy tales of our time, but it's hard to relate to characters when they are just purely good or evil for the sake of being one or the other. The only character who struggles with this dichotomy is the older brother, Salim. For this reason he's the most interesting character, because he's the only unpredictable character. I couldn't stand the game show host. He was on the evil side of things, but I'm not sure why. Ultimately, I wanted to see an ending that could equal its beginning, but it didn't hit me like I wanted it to. The guy and girl love one another just because they do, regardless of knowing whether or not they share any interests or actually get along over an extended period of time.",Slumdog Millionaire
490,kgottlicher,"Sounds good ""on paper"", but executed implausibly and sloppily, with extra cheese",4,3 February 2009,"This movie is a great proof that Joe McMoviegoer only cares about the plot in its most simplified synopsis version, and nothing else. I admit: the IMDb synopsis DID sound interesting. But an interesting idea is one thing; how it's executed is a whole new ball game. Let me start by saying that the Who Wants to Be a Millionaire show is not (repeat: NOT) aired live: it's a recording. This makes the entire ending fall flat on its face, as it rests on the premise that it IS aired live. How can people just ignore such plot holes in order to enjoy the movie, I don't know. Speaking of the show - one of the early questions was this:What is written on the national emblem of India:A. The TRUTH Triumphs. B. LIES Triumph. C. FASHION Triumphs. D. MONEY Triumphs.Most of us have never seen the emblem of India, but can easily guess the answer, right? Yet our dumb protagonist uses the Ask the Audience ""lifeline"".Come on, Mr. Director. I know you had to get rid of one lifeline in order to leave only two for your vision of the grand finale, but couldn't you have picked a more realistic question to do so? Is our protagonist such a moron that he actually thought the national emblem might say ""Lies/Fashion/Money Triumphs""?!The premise of the movie is that Jamal, the protagonist, albeit an uneducated slumdog, knows the answers to most of the questions simply because he has ""lived them"", so to speak. An interesting fictional premise, but...Thus our Jamal knows that the revolver was invented by Colt (and not Browning, Wesson, et al) simply because his brother once, when attacked by bad guys, miraculously, deus ex machina-style, pulled a Colt we'd never seen him acquire prior to that and killed one of them. And that's how Jamal knew Colt and not Wesson invented the revolver.In a similarly inane fashion, he knows that the face on the $100 bill is Ben Franklin, because his blind(!) slumteen beggar buddy, after Jamal had given him $100 and described the face on the bill as a ""bald man with hair on the sides"", told him it's Ben Franklin. Are we supposed to believe that underage, illiterate, uneducated Indian beggar kids that have never seen a book or a TV set in their life, let alone a 100-dollar bill, know what Franklin looks like? Please. But I guess anything's possible in a movie in which an elementary school slum dropout talks to British tourists in perfect BBC RP, firing out collocations such as ""in a top-class fashion"" and ""maximum-pileup traffic accident"" like it ain't no thang.Also, the final, million-dollar question is (drum roll): Name the third Musketeer: Athos, Porthos... Come on. If the final questions were that easy, we'd all be millionaires. And how does Jamal know the answer? He takes a blind guess, because it was his destiny to win. ""It was written"". And he guesses right.Just like he told the (also teenage) love of his life that they'll find each other no matter what, because ""it is written"". Come on. I haven't heard such salad-tossers blurted by teenagers(!) since Dawson's Creek. Even The Last of the Mohicans barely managed to get off with similar cheese. I could go on forever.So, in the end, our fate's pet Jamal answers all of the questions, while his big brother frees the girl from the jaws of mafia by killing the boss. Mind you, he first killed bad guys, then joined them, and now he switched it up again while you weren't looking and mended his ways. He held Jamal at gunpoint, raped the love of his life, and cut her face, but now he suddenly wants to help them. Must have been touched by the hand of God off-screen. Anyways, the girl is now free to catch the impossible live airing of the show, reunites with Jamal on-air, and they live happily ever after as millionaires. And she thought they would ""only be united in death"" (direct quote... the kids of today, so profound).Because puppy love conquers all. Especially if your future-boyfriend is about to become a millionaire. So, two hours of an interesting premise ruined by carelessness in details and chuckle-inducing implausibility, slopped with saccharine, drowned in a one-sided portrayal of life in India (read the other negative reviews for more on that), and spiced up with a dash of that straight-out-of-Bollywood fairytale love story - which you couldn't give a rat's ass about even if you wanted to, since the girl suffers from a severe case of character underdevelopment (all we know about her is that she's ""the most beautiful girl in the world"" (of course)), and there's more chemistry in your hamburger than there is between her and Jamal.But I guess the morning after watching the movie you'll only remember the core of the story as summarized in the IMDb synopsis, and that would suffice. Good for you.P.S. Nice hand-held camera work in a couple of shots. And nice colors. The only things hinting, albeit infinitely remotely, at the fact that this is the same guy that directed Trainspotting. Incomprehensible.",Slumdog Millionaire
491,eagleeyedcritic,Salaam Bombay remake,3,13 July 2012,"Don't waste your time on this movie.This is an old, recycled storyline; a poor copy of a much better movie - Salam Bombay (1988) - the real deal which had real street kids as actors. This movie has gratuitous gross scenes and the plot with the lottery was some desperate fairy tale attempt to appeal to the masses which worked, since it got such great reviews.A lot of people refer to this as a feel good movie but I refer to it as a poor copy.It's sad that people have to see a movie like this to feel better about their own country leaving them thinking things are so bad 'over there' when worse human rights abuses happen right here in North America.",Slumdog Millionaire

Hard hitting, challenging, poignant, entertaining, uplifting all at the same time.Really don't understand the BBFC ratings though. This was a 15, but trailers beforehand were for films rated 12 which seemed to focus exclusively on guns, violence & menace. Yet here's a film which contained very little bad language, violence but not in the least bit gratuitous or gory (it was nice to be left to use our imagination on some of the scenes), a love interest with NO sex what-so-ever!, and a message where honesty, integrity, faithfulness & hope prevail - yet this is a 15! Go figure.The scenes of slum life were thoroughly sobering & depressing. They certainly give an appreciation of the rule of law and of economic justice & fair play that we have as our cultural foundation and our inheritance. Got me thinking how would you ever lift a country out of such a malaise, and also how quickly/easily it would be to sink into one. This is cinema at it's best - harrowing & uplifting.

If I had been in a cinema ,I would have walked out .No amount of seeing him get to win a girl / money / get revenge / make good / could make up for the disturbing scenes of children running , crying , being blinded , etc ..I found it depressing that we were supposed to have been uplifted by it all working out in the end.

494,chez123-836-329812,A beautiful thought provoking film,10,4 September 2010,"I have to say I was really looking forward to seeing this film. The buzz surrounding it made me curious to see what all the fuss was about and despite it not being my usual type of film (I'm more of a romantic comedy lover myself) I really felt like I took a lot away from it. It's not just a way to pass a couple of hours on a Saturday night, it was an experience you don't get from a lot of films. It wasn't a funny story, far from it, but it was funny in places where you have the young Jamal taking tourists for mugs, and the youngest Jamal covered in other peoples waste. Doesn't sound that funny but it was oddly cute nonetheless.I was engrossed in the story of how Dev Patel's character Jamal, a contestant on India's 'Who wants to be a Millionaire' explains how, after being arrested on suspicion of cheating on the show, he came to know the answers most people wouldn't. With each question comes a torturous memory and how the experiences of his childhood with his brother in the slums of Mumbai leads him to be one question away from the jackpot. While he explains how he came to be able to answer such impossible questions he tells of Latika, the girl he loved and had let go. This is essentially to do with winning love over money and takes you through what people are prepared to do to get these things. The youngest actors in the film are amazing to me and could out act plenty gracing the red carpets of Hollywood these days. There was nothing about this film I didn't like. The sound track, the story, the actors, the setting - all perfect. It wasn't made on a ridiculous budget which kept the story realistic. It was thought provoking while entertaining all the same. It most definitely gets 10 out of 10 from me.",Slumdog Millionaire
495,uckpshh,A Film With Lots to Offer.,9,17 February 2009,"I saw this film last night with a few friends after hearing some sparkling reviews. While I was expecting a positive experience, it wouldn't be fair to say that my expectations were as high as they were for a movie like ""The Dark Knight"" or last year's ""There Will Be Blood."" That said, my expectations were met, and I experienced what is probably one of the better films I've seen all year, but certainly not one of the best I've seen in recent years, let alone of all time.What I must get out immediately is that the performances by the younger cast, the art direction, the cinematography, and the editing are all top notch. The characters are fully formed for the most part, and are given the necessary time to develop. The film also has a great soundtrack, which should be worth noting. Also positive is the emergence of Freida Pinto, an actress we should all probably be looking out for in the next few years.Having sung all the praises, a few things need to be said about the film's flaws. The male lead, Dev Patel (as Jamal), seems only capable of one expression: intensity. And as the story progresses, and Jamal grows into adulthood, I felt that the character had stopped developing. What would have been a charmingly optimistic childhood fantasy carries over into adult life, something that seems an unlikely occurrence given the film's theme that the children are forced into growing up quickly.Added to this are a few directorial decisions by the film's director, Danny Boyle, which I felt didn't belong in the decidedly more realistic tone of the movie (I'm not talking about the Bollywood dance, which I thought was a fantastic choice). Perhaps this is a matter of taste, but I felt that the more intense scenes were not as intense or suspenseful as I would have liked, nor was there as much humor as there was in a similar film, ""Angela's Ashes"" (I know the subject matter is serious, but there were more laughs in ""No Country for Old Men""). Add to that a few on-screen metaphors, and one over-the-top ""what could have been"" moment, and I felt taken out of the experience just momentarily.As for how the film stacks up to winning an Oscar this 2009, I can tell you now that I haven't seen ""Frost/Nixon"", ""The Reader"" (along with everyone else on the planet), or ""Milk"", but what I can also tell you is that ""Slumdog"" is a better film than ""Benjamin Button."" Of the films that came out this year, I can tell you that I felt ""The Dark Knight"" and ""WALL-E"" were both better movies that I feel should have filled some of these Oscar spots. If ""Slumdog"" had come out in the year of ""Babel"" (a similar film which is FAR more affecting and leaves a much greater impact, and had they both been released in the same year would have left ""Slumdog"" out of Oscar contention), ""The Departed"", ""No Country for Old Men"", or ""There Will Be Blood"" it would not stand a chance at the Oscars whatsoever. Judging by other award ceremonies and its current competition, however, it will most likely win, and probably deserves to.",Slumdog Millionaire
496,epa101,Great all-round film,9,21 September 2009,"This film was a huge success because it has something for everyone: romance, violence, humour, adventure and a good narrative. You need to pay attention to slot together the flashbacks to the answers that the main character, Jamal, makes in the Indian ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"" game. The film shows the numerous setbacks and challenges that Jamal has had during his life, which is a theme everyone can relate to somehow.On a second viewing, I concluded that the torture scene at the start was unnecessary. It can be hard to see how it fits with the game-show at the beginning, and it does seem unrealistic that Jamal would have been tortured so brutally before being sat down for a nice chat. They should have cut the torture scene out.",Slumdog Millionaire
497,hellfire_30,Danny Boyle's Modern Day Fable.,9,20 January 2009,"Where to begin when describing something as unique as Slumdog Millionnaire? Generally, the critics have been lavish in their praise for Danny Boyle's latest piece of work. Others have not been as captivated; the main gripe that the cynics both in the professional field and those making up the membership of various internet discussions is that of shortcomings plot-wise. Let me begin by first acknowledging the relevance of the cynics, there are indeed problems of continuity and realism with the plot. That being said; Slumdog Millionnaire is hands down one of the most captivating pieces of cinema released in the last few years - and as of this time of writing, it was the run away winner at the BAFTA's and looks set to pick up several other accolades in the not so distant future. It seems to me that the nay-sayers pointing to the small plot holes are not taking the whole picture into account - much akin to taking out a DIY home forensics kit whilst trying to work out the 'who done it' of a murder mystery novel. I mean, of course we can isolate parts for individual scrutiny, but this fails to take into account the beauty of the unified whole - and my is it beautiful. A whimsical musical score, intelligently fast pacing, great cinematography and endless charm all blend seamlessly to create something truly delightful to the senses. These all surround a highly compelling story, which it has to be said at times trades off the shackles and stiffness of reality for the more malleable and imaginative artistic vision. A 'compromise' that works to great effect. The Story which consists of child-hood love entwined with tragic circumstances reads at times like a fairytale Which explains why this movie has been described as a modern day fable. This makes for a refreshing change; but to some, brought up on cinema's tendency for the melancholic may appear trite. Definitely a case of the whole is greater that the sum of it's parts; and the whole is by far a magnificent spectacle to behold.",Slumdog Millionaire

Obviously, my mush of a brain was wrong, but after the opening seconds, there was no way I was turning it off.Unless you were told about the plot of this movie in detail, you truly do not have a damn clue what is going to go down. Because honestly, if the descriptions were specific about how this film would play out, I am betting most of us would decide to watch Gran Torino instead. The story line of this movie is outrageous, and beyond coincidental, yet these truths only seem to capitalize on the real reason so many of us absolutely adore this film - we get to feel all of the good and bad emotions that we often unknowingly desire, without a sliver of dread or doubt left at its conclusion.You will definitely laugh. A lot. Because the Ayush Mahesh Khedekar's Jamal is the funniest, most lovable character you may ever see on a screen. His older brother, Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail's Salim, has an ego that may distract from the joy at times, but Rubina Ali's Latika (or the Third Musketeer), instantly brings love and joy back into the story. Each of these child actors, as well as the others playing the older versions of themselves, were so brilliant and each's character seem to fit so perfectly with their true personalities. Rarely will you see such raw talent in acting, let alone, child actors. It is remarkable and an absolute delight to watch, despite some of the despair and harsh realities they have to endure in their worlds.You also may cry. But most likely it will be with the biggest smile on your face. Why? Probably just because it was written that way.",Slumdog Millionaire

501,guillaumerouy,"Great movie, but not for the Indian Tourism Office...",8,16 January 2009,"This is a great film. Danny Boyle is quite of touching-every-kind of genre, from ""drugs-comedy"" with ""Transpointing"" to Horror movie, with ""28 days later"", and many more, ""The Beach"" and his sweet masterpiece ""Millionaire"". Funny enough, this is his second film with ""millionaire"" word in the main title. And for this one ""millionaire"" refers, of course, to the super-matching UK's game from Celador ""Who wants to be a millionaire ?"", the very first TV game in history in which the contestant can win (in the UK where it is originally from) 1 000 000 pounds. The game itself is only a tool to tell a life story : the whole film focuses on the very struggling and tough life of two brothers from a miserable area of Mumbay, India. And actually it is what is all about. While I enjoyed the acting, cinematography, editing and even the music, the description of India, in this movie, is quite horrible. After watching this movie, there is no way you will visit this country. India is : Over crowed and populated, very poor, with Hindus People providing religious intolerance - even to kill the Muslims (which is unfortunately a fact, Hindus being violent with Catholics as well) - very young kids orphaned living in bins with no help but evil people who exploit them, blind them and ask them to beg for even more money, police who - while completely useless according to the situations described in the films - do not hesitate to torture suspicious people in order to them to speak, etc, etc, etc...This film gave me an idea of India who made me sick, and revealed even more how come Mother Theresa had struggled to do what she did.

Once this is done. of course, everyone has a say on the pros and cons, whys and wherefores. Make you wonder why they bother.I've seen a few of Danny Boyle's movies: Shallow Grave, Millions, my favourite Trainspotting and now Slumbog Millionaire. The latter with all it's praise and little gold statuettes is not a vast success. Not for me anywhere. It's a curious hydrid of Trainspotting and A Life Less Ordinary. It has a mix of edgy realism and romantic fantasy and suffers because of it.Perhaps it's me, seeing Danny Boyle's name above the title and creating unreasonable expectations. Boyle is able to make whatever film he likes, and I don't think he'll be fretting over the critical of commercial reaction thus far.Slumbog works best in the first half hour. It's an intriguing story and kicked off with a bang. Children living, playing, stealing and surviving in the slums of Mumbai. For many of us, I'm sure this is quite an eye-opener. All those people!

503,anjru,Top Movie of the Year by Andrew Malekoff,10,11 January 2009,"This is the best movie of the year. And, there were a number of movies that I really loved this year. Slumdog was a clear and unambiguous cut above everything else in what I consider to be a good year for movies. How do I determine that it was a good year? I saw more movies that I loved or really liked than in a long time.At first I was put off by the pacing that I thought was a bit slow with the movie shifting from present to past. But patience paid off as I gradually got in sync with the pacing and structure of the film. And, it was a big payoff that provided me with an intimate view of an orphaned child's harrowing journey to meet his destiny. The nine actors that played the three key characters during childhood, preadolescence and young adulthood were excellent and believable. The were perfectly cast and played their parts wonderfully.Interestingly, when I saw the trailer weeks before, I thought that Slumdog was an Indian comedy about a poor kid who wins the game show I Want to Be a Millionaire. I immediately had an association to My Big Fat Greek Wedding. And, although I loved that movie, Slumdog is a sprawling epic compared to the hilarious sit-com-Greek-Wedding. Slumdog is much more than I expected. A young man, played flawlessly by Dev Patel, is trying his hand at the Indian version of the game show I Want to be a Millionaire. His motives are fuzzy at first. He is not a typical contestant. We learn that it was his destiny that brought him to compete.We discover how he came to know the answers to the questions (did he cheat?, is he a genius? or, did fate have a hand in his knowledge?). We learn about how close bonds and loyalty among three childhood friends are stretched to painful extremes over time despite dramatically different means that each must use to adapt to the cruel circumstances that they must overcome to survive. Slumdog is a hopeful movie, that underscores the value of resilience, and highlights the many faces and means of loyalty, against the overwhelming odds of poverty and evil; this movie deserves to be honored for its achievement.",Slumdog Millionaire
504,muddam,Must Watch...Brilliant Screenplay and Editing...,9,2 March 2009,"Jamal (Dev Patel) is an orphan from the slums of Mumbai. He gets to attend the game show 'who wants to be a millionaire' when he is 18. Surprisingly he starts giving the right answers till he gets into the final round. And all these questions have relevance to certain incidents happened in his life. The game show host and cops suspect that Jamal cheated in the show. The rest of the story is all about how he proves his innocence and wins his lady love that's been playing hide and seek with him since his childhood.The kids who did the roles of Salim, Jamal and Latika are adorable. They are the best in the film than the main leads. Among the notable Indian actors, Saurabh Shukla is the best. Ankur Vikal is excellent. Anil Kapoor is pretty natural as a wicked and biased host of the game show. After some point of time, we start hating him. Dev Patel is adequate. Irfan Khan played similar kind of roles earlier. Hence it is a cake walk for him.When somebody is doing a film on a slum boy, it is bound to show the hard reality in slum areas. That does not mean that India has been projected in the wrong way. When somebody watched 'City of God' which shows the bad side of Brazil country, one expects it to be a poor country with little scope for improvement. But actually Brazil is one of the fastest growing economies in the world along with Russia, India and China (BRIC countries). India is not for the people who judge it by watching fictional movies. Hence, let's not bother about it.Slumdog Millionaire is an Indian film at heart with Indian emotions catering to Indian sensibilities. This film balances arts with commerce. It is also the best example of presenting a story in a realistic way without missing the formula. The best part in this film is the screenplay and most of the credit for this screenplay should go to the Indian writer Vikas Swaroop who wrote 'Q & A' book. Direction of the film is world class and narration balances the sensible humor and subtle tragedy.Background score by AR Rehman is peppy and energetic (especially the beat scored by kids chasing scenes in the initial part of the movie). Cinematography is excellent. Editing is superb with no dull moment. This film shows Mumbai slums in a magnificent way.

Watched it, and after all the awards and praise I was hoping for something to blow my mind or at least be extremely entertaining, instead I got a solid 7. Compared with City of God (which is similar in many aspects) this can't really hold its ground. For one because the first was actually based on a true story and thus also written and filmed believable from the start up to the end and it was a movie depicting things as they really are (albeit maybe a little flashy) and focusing on the life story of one individual in the middle of it all, as opposed to Slumdog, which mainly focuses on the ""Who is Gonna Be A Millionaire""-show (seemingly to be more appealing to the western civilization and TV viewers) all around... No surprise with shows like ""American Idol"" and ""Dancing With the Stars"" leading the ratings in the US and in some cases International TV, while shows with brains get the axe by the minute. If you want to view it as a ""mirror"" into Indian culture etc. I guess it was okay, but again it focused too much on the show and the respective answers. There are movies with a more... subtle approach that I liked more and imo succeeded better in doing that, e.g. Darjeeling Limited for example... Also there were some cringe worthy moments like the flashbacks near the end, how he couldn't answer some of the more simple general questions, but somehow ""circumstances"" allowed him to answer questions in the show, and how winning just by coincidence saves ones entire life and is something to be admired, a few of those ruined it even more for me...

After their mother is killed the two struggle to survive in the streets. They meet a girl named Latika. Jamal falls in love with her. They are exploited as beggars by one of the slum's gang bosses. They escape and get torn apart. While Jamal is lead by hope and love and keeps his mind clear, his brother becomes a product of the violent harsh times they live in and soon enters the crime business. Jamal tries more than once to find Latika and to escape and make a living together. But how, she once asks him? There are no opportunities for the poor people in the slums. You have to subdue to one of the (often) cruel rich guys to lead a passably good life, she thinks.Not for the money but for the love Jamal joins the famous quiz show ""Who wants to be a millionaire"".It's a rich story about friendship, trust, betrayal and love.The film though an independent is very well made. Great cinematography and editing here. I think the way the story is told following the questions in the game show to review the life of Jamal was a very good idea.But there were some points about the plot that bothered me.I asked myself about the security guys who first torture Jamal cause he is accused to cheat on the show. Therefore they can certainly be considered as cruel people who probably don't care much about Jamals rights. Would they even care about what he has to say, would they make the effort listening to him and if so, would they just believe him?Jamal's little conflict with the arrogant quiz master, who fears about his fame being the most important guy in the show, was another good point in the movie though not much time was spent on this. But then (sadly) like in many Danny Boyle movies (28 days later, the beach, sunshine (well sunshine was bad from beginning to end)) for me the last part however falls a little short. When the romance overtakes the story it feels more like a quite ordinary love story ending that is kind of forced like when Latika gets the handy of Jamals brother and is then called by Jamal sitting in the game show I think that was kind of dull.THEN there are the scenes that wanted me to rate this movie 0/10. It's when the movie is already over and the end credits are running over the screen. When the whole cast started to dance around I cringed! What the hell is going on now!? Have I just seen a good, serious movie or was it some sort of Disney/high school musical!? What a ridiculous, cheesy and bitter note was left in my mind ... anyway ...This movie gets a 7.5/10.",Slumdog Millionaire
510,Drifteral99,This is not a 'feelgood' film,8,12 January 2009,"You have to go and see this film if...a) you care a fig about people, no matter their skin tone. b)you like Indian music c) Don't believe the stories about this being a 'feelgood' movie because it isn't. I'd not have gone to the trouble of going to the cinema to see a 'feelgood' film...I'm happily grumpy much of the time. Anyone who thinks this is 'feelgood' lacks a social conscience or a brain in which to house one. d)You enjoy quizzes e)like most people with an ounce of human decency you enjoy the triumph of good over evil.This is no 'Mamma-Mia' it won't plaster a silly grin over your face nor will it give you good dreams. The scenes of the aforementioned slums are an affront to decency. Acre upon acre of corrugated tin roofs which shelter millions of the helpless and the truly hopeless. For hope must be in short supply in such a terrible place. The high buildings which are rising alongside the shanty might offer some of course...a job in a call centre as a 'phone-basher' perhaps.From such a hive of overcrowded industry comes our hero. In unlikely guise. The film is a series of flashbacks detailing Jamal's life so far. And what a life it had been. I'll not spoil it for you but he somehow survived childhood with only mental scars and many of his contemporaries were not so lucky. His big brother Salem had a hand in said survival and the love of his like Latika drove him on. The evil that men do is well depicted. It doesn't stop the lad arriving on the telly facing a 20,000,000 million Rupee question before a 90,000,000 audience. Any fantasy can engineer the outcome. This one was unlikely , but apt. Two hours plus flew by... ...We exited in darkness talking about what we'd just seen - always a good sign. My Wife's instant reaction on leaving the theatre was to gush 'that was excellent' . I was slightly taken aback by this down to earth woman's enthusiasm but had to admit we'd just enjoyed a film extravaganza.A decidedly human story in a place where humanity teems, and the currency of survival is a little less of a lottery now that prosperity -for some at least is knocking at the door but they have a long, long way to go. This was an eye opener and puts the credit crunch in perspective.If you DO go then DO NOT LEAVE before the end credits have rolled.",Slumdog Millionaire
511,hfgirl,Interesting review,9,19 November 2008,There is a really great review of Slumdog Millionaire from two old school Hollywood veterans. These two have made and seen so many films and they have very strong opinions especially about this film. Is it really an Oscar contender? What about the story structure and writing? These two discuss the themes and make comparisons to other foreign films. They are so enjoyable to watch and their explanation of the film and scenes to look out for are delightful. You will find their insight and humor refreshing and they may even inspire you to go out and see Slumdog. Check the review out at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1y55cLe0c6g,Slumdog Millionaire

513,alexmccourt,Not half bad,5,10 February 2009,"The first half of this movie was good. The kids were excellent, the whole effect colourful and fast moving. Although it dealt with some pretty traumatic incidents and serious issues with too light a touch and was a tad condescending, on the whole, it wasn't bad.The second half was pretty dire. Clichéd, syrupy nonsense which spoiled the whole with wooden acting from the adults and far too much simpering about. Of course, some people like the sugary stuff. If you do, go and see the whole thing, you'll enjoy it. If, like me, you hate badly done schmalz, go and see the first half then go for a dunkin doughnut or whatever to make up for what you missed.",Slumdog Millionaire

The road ahead is still full of difficulties Ji, he answered every question correctly, but was suspected to be cheating, just because he was from the slum, which is really ironic.",Slumdog Millionaire
516,oscarfanatic,"Great little film, actually...",8,24 December 2008,"Slumdog Millionaire is a very nice achievement by director Danny Boyle. Combinging the dirty slums of India with the roller-coaster of emotions that is ""Who wants to be a millionaire?"", Boyle gives an appreciative audience an experience not to be forgotten.Performances were solidly good, with props going specifically to Petal. He plays up the story and becomes a character that everyone can relate to. And the music in this movie? I mean... WOW. Amazing is all I can say. Simply amazing. ""O Saya"" and ""Jai Ho"" are two songs I would most definitely like to see around Oscar time. With it's euphoric ending and emotional weight, Slumdog succeeds on many different levels, making for a....... FRESH movie going experience.Now, do I think this is the best movie of the year? No. I think critics have done what they usually do and chosen a champion of the season to lavish everything on. 2008 has proved to be a very good year in film, and so with that in mind, I do think this will and should get a best picture nomination. Do I think it should win? Probably not. Would I be upset if it did? Never =]",Slumdog Millionaire
517,aurora7,An ode to humanity,10,19 December 2008,"Danny Boyle does it again! While being grossly under-appreciated in Hollywood circles, this generation's answer to Frank Capra, Steven Spielberg and Francois Truffault has crafted yet another masterpiece for the Generations X and Y crowd, in the vein of ""Trainspotting"", ""Millions"" and ""28 Days Later"". With visuals reminiscent of ""City of God"", a soundtrack straight out of the hippest clubs of London and a tale which is both evocative of Charles Dickens (in it's depiction of the poor and the slums) and Sinclair Lewis (with his social commentary on ""Progress"" with a capital P), Boyle has finally brought India to mainstream Hollywood and North America. This film will become a historical document as Mumbai itself is the backdrop of the story and we witness the transformation of that city from 3rd world mega-city backwater, to being on the verge of becoming one of this century's financial and cultural hubs, along with Beijing and Dubai. As Asia takes center stage as it shakes off centuries of colonial-imposed self- doubt and lack of confidence, Boyle has masterfully delivered a narrative for the ages on the cost of progress, both morally and historically and on the redemptive power of true love. The cast of largely unknown actors were first-class with an exceptionally talented group of children. It may sound sad at first glance, a story about kids growing up in slums etc. but in actuality this is a film of exuberance, full of life, intensity and joy and to paraphrase Richard Corlis of Time, an ode to humanity. Don't wait for the DVD, see this on the big screen NOW! ( 10/10 )",Slumdog Millionaire

520,Notebooks_on_Cinema,"Again, who directed this Bollywood flick?",1,16 December 2008,"I was ecstatic, elated, on cloud nine after coming out of the theater. What a Bollywood flick I just finished watching! But then I found myself in a confused state. Why revered film critics across the globe have showered so much accolades on this Bollywoodish make. I must be missing something. And I don't.The movie centers around tumultuous life of two boys, their journey from a Mumbai slum to two different worlds, dominated by corruption and adolescence like naiveté.The movie has all the elements of a Bollywood masala flick that is ridiculed by foreign and Indian media on a regular basis because of its filmsy, melodramatic, and often childish like treatment of any and every subject. THIS MOVIE IS NO EXCEPTION. Recall the following scenes from the movie:Two brothers, one treads the path of eternal honesty while the other ventures into the world of immorality. That reminds me of Deewaar (1975). I bet Mr. Danny Boyle must have taken few lessons of Bollywood movie-making from likes of Subhas Ghai, David Dhawan, Manmohan Desai etc. Come on Admit it.Then the love interest of the younger brother is found in Mumbai's red light areas? Reminds me of Sadak by Sanjay Dutta, among others. Damn it! It must be me. Danny simply imagined these stuff from his vast experience with Indian way of life and it has NOTHING to do with Bollywood masalas.Then recall the death scene of the older brother. That's a typical Indian death scene. The last scene where the male and female leads meet each other, are we watching a romantic Hindi flick?The script of the movie is filled with Mr. Boyle's faulty and nonsensical imaginations. Where the older kid gets the gun, suddenly? How these two most shabbily looking kids manage to check into an apparently five-star hotel? How come the older kid knows the address of the local mafia? There are many. What Mr. Boyle was thinking. Then there is efficient selling of world famous Indian poverty filled with filth and pain, and agony and all other stereotypical things that go well with Western view of any ""third world countries"". Ultimately Mr. Boyle dishes out a palatable Bollywood flick.If all these things were captured in celluloid by a NON-WHITE filmmaker, then western media would simply reject it straightaway. But this is not the case here. Its made by a WHITE filmmaker, for a WHITE audience who love those movies made on third world countries, which only reinforce their age-old ideas about India. I can bet that all the Bollywood directors are weeping in secret and thinking why can't I make such a terribly bad movie and garner all these international accolades. YOU CANT because you are not a white. As simple as that. So Mr Boyle thanks for selling India to the western world, making a cliché non-sense melodramatic movie and hiding behind neo-realism film-making shell and at the end of the day just pretend (when you will be receiving some filthy award) that you are such a genius. And for western film critics, you may have some knowledge of good films, but you are ultimately a White person, enjoying deep in heart the poverty of a developing world. What a nonsense.",Slumdog Millionaire
521,pdlaker34,How to make THE BEST FILM OF THE YEAR: Amelie+City of God+Quiz Show+Bollywood+Danny Boyle= THE BEST FILM OF THE YEAR,10,6 December 2008,"Danny Boyle has created a modern day version of what the great old films use to be like, mixed in perfectly with what grounded modern indie cinema is supposed to be today. The film has elements of life determining fate, Crime in poverty stricken streets, heart-pulsing sound, a bone chilling score that should earn A.R. Rahman an Oscar, great soundtrack, performances by unknown actors which adding even more vitality too the film, competition and love between brothers, and a destined romance. what more can you ask of a film today. it is so hard too accomplish something like this today when most of the films that try too this fail, look at Baz Luhrman's ""Australia"". That project failed because it tried too copy the old instead of using the old and too create something more unique. The chase scene through the streets of mumbai when Jamal is a boy running from the cops is just as of an action scene as when Harvey Dent is being transported too the Jail and The Joker is chasing him in the Dark Knight(noticed I said almost). The film is tragic and deals with real issues, but because you are seeing the film through a child's eyes it is not depressing because children never get down for too long. Children and Pre-Teens always find the bright side of a situation, they are really much better at getting by happy then adults. This is a bold film that reached for a lot of different goals and succeeded triumphantly. If the film doesn't win best picture at the Oscars, I will loose all hope in the academy. Look out for a Oscar nominations in editing, sound, screenplay, director, and I wouldn't even be surprised if Dev Patel gets nominated for best supporting actor.SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is the best film of the year and MY FAVORITE FILM OF THE YEAR, because of not being afraid to be about fate and crime and love and death.

Cidade de Deus, Shichinin no samurai, Ladri di biciclette were made in native language and so the originality of the movie was intact even though I watched those movies with English subtitles. Slumdog millionaire is totally lacking on this aspect and it is definitely not a film to be rated in the top 250.I understand that the movie is made for western audience. But, It would have been better if the movie was made in Hindi and was released with subtitles to the western audience (similar to Lagaan)."" ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Movies should be criticized as a whole - picking out one thing to criticize is just too shallow to be helpful! It's like criticizing the color of someone's clothes in a movie. You have to let the creators and director have some leeway in how they present the movie and what audience they are trying to reach. And such a criticism doesn't tell us much about why the reviewer thinks the movie should be poorly rated, it only tells us about his bias about one aspect of the film. If a reviewer can't approach a movie as a whole then what have they accomplished in their review? Only that they are reviewing a bias that their ego can't cope with.

I have to say...I have no regrets for sacrificing my relaxation time on a Friday evening to watch something that literally didn't give me the chance to go to the toilet half way through! Slumdog Millionaire is an absolute masterpiece and there is no other way to describe it. Such a simple idea developed into a very believable story which is a literal 'kick in the face' to the Indian Authorities.It reveals the INS and OUTS of the real India you would never have dreamt of (not all the Bollywood rubbish) and takes you through a journey you wouldn't get lost in or be sidetracked.There is some mild humour in this pretty serious movie, some strong language and scenes which make you cringe away, put your hands over your eyes and literally start sobbing (and not many films have done that to me). There are parts where you wish you could comfort people and wish you could kill them yourself.If I were to criticise any element of this movie, it would be Anil Kapoor's acting. He's lost his touch. Even the younger kids who were real children in India who live in Slums were better than him and they just had to improvise.It's definitely worth the watch and I congratulate Film4 for making it look so easy to create a BLOCKBUSTER.",Slumdog Millionaire
524,mjlevine,Best film in a very long time.,10,26 January 2009,"You can tell that a film was really good. The time passes really quickly and you don't want it to end.The film is told in real time and in flashbacks. It is basically an episode of Who Wants to be a Millionaire in India. The top prize is 20 million Rupees, or just short of £300,000. In a country where the average wage is around £1500 per year this is a fortune. It centers on the life of Jamal and his brother Salim. The fact that both made it to adulthood given their start in life is a miracle. Growing up in the slums of Mumbai the boys face obstacles and life threatening situations from birth. Orphaned and left to fend for themselves these street kids live from day to day. Eventually they link up with Latika, herself an orphan.We switch between present day and the past as Jamal recounts how he came to appear on WWTBAM and how he knew the answers to the questions. He's recounting them to a senior policeman after being tortured because the show's presenter thinks he is cheating. No one has ever got as far as Jamal on the program.This is a truly brilliant film.

525,austinicity,It's OK,7,7 June 2014,"I know this is a well renowned movie, as I am watching it in 2014 after it won all of it's awards and maybe my judgement is skewed. The editing was great, the acting good, but I never could buy into the storyline for some reason. Maybe bc I'm white middle class, or maybe bc it was a fairy tail for the third world country folk. Either Way, it is definitely entertaining, but I can't stop questioning the feasibility of this movie. It's basically another romeo and juliet storyline wrapped up in a different cultural setting. I'm not saying it is bad, I'm just saying that I don't think it should have won the awards it did. I mean seriously, how many times has this movie been made? More than once. Bottom line; Did I enjoy it?; Yes, I inevitably did and It is def worth watching, but I did not get the overwhelming grandeur or feel good moment on which this movie of supposedly calibre grips the audience (which is me) into a vacuum of emotion. You can go to India and witness the grisly realisation of life; of being one in a literally billion of souls meandering their subsistence in poverty; and this film does a good job of representing that, but the overlying storyline was such a fantasy plot that I immediately rejected its heir to storytelling.Real India is cruel and unusual, especially to a westernern, but this was not an accurate representation imho.

526,rossawilson01-1,Rough jewel,8,12 January 2009,"There are a lot of posts and comments about the Indian caste system and the way the movie depicts slum reality. Many feel it glosses over these subjects in order to fulfill its entertainment directive. Not true.A movie about a slum that's positive and uplifting isn't necessarily feel good gloss, the reality about Hinduism, is that the whole point in the drama of life is to see through it to the beauty in life no matter where it may be. Hope then is a wonderful contrast to this environment, the sun, the colours, the people the adventure.. if these things can't give us a reason to go on what can.That's the first part of the movie.The second part, when the kids are older unfortunately finds itself drawn back to the mainstream motorway after the first half took an exciting adventurous turn off. The plot here becomes usual, cliché even, the drama is fairly superficial and you can't help thinking that there could have been a whole lot more depth.That said it's probably this half of the movie that brought in more regular movie goers. I can't help that think if the movie had continued to explore and probe the boundaries of adventure in India, the masses would have given it a wider birth.A tale of two halfs then; but as a whole, and even with the predictable soap opera like ending, it's a real achievement, the energy and euphoria Boyle creates is unique. It engages you start to finish and is very definitely an exciting worth while ride.. deserved of all the Oscars it has won in my humble opinion.",Slumdog Millionaire

This movie was exotic and pretty but unbelievable, empty and asinine.Please don't take seriously its depiction of beautiful, exotic 3rd world poverty. Instead this is a genre mash-up of the good brother/bad brother gangster movie with the Dickensian orphan rags-to-riches story. It does pretty well on those modest terms, but it's a colorful, violent fantasy, not a serious expose or a National Geographic documentary.The use of police torture to build suspense in the first act (not a spoiler - these are the opening sequences of the film); stylized violence against children; reliance on prettified poverty and the exotic ""other""; the gratuitous resolution of the ""bad"" brother's story arc: you know what? If this movie had been made in the 70s it would have been set in Harlem and today we'd call it ""blaxploitation."" This movie is about on the level with ""Shaft"" and ""Superfly.""

532,cheers-2,Pretty darn good...,8,4 February 2009,"So on Saturday my husband and I decided to go to a movie. We originally went to the theatre to see Revolutionary Road but at the last minute I decided that Slumdog Millionaire would be a better choice to see with him and that I could see the RR next time when I go alone. I must admit  I had done a stellar job at avoiding trailers and interviews for Slumdog. I had no clue what it was about. None. And like I usually suggest  try to do this as often as possible. The less you know about a movie going in  the better. In saying that, if you have not seen the movie, I actually suggest you do not read more of what I write about it. Let the film be seen through fresh eyes.Slumdog Millionaire, directed by Danny Boyle, is one of the best underdog type movies I have seen. But because of that, don't think it is a straight forward or as common as those we are used to popping up in Cineplex's across the country. I actually think of this movie as a cross between Hoosiers, The Usual Suspects and Red Dawn. Except...it is nothing like any of those movies. So figure that one out!! SM takes place in Mumbai, India. The main character, Jamal played by British actor, Dev Patel, is a contestant on India's most popular television show, 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire'. In India, this show is much more popular than it ever was in the US and the host is considered an idol. Jamal shocks the audience, crew and police by answering every question correctly. When they break for the day, just before the 20 million rupee question, Jamal is taken into custody on the grounds of suspected cheating. Believing that a 'slumdog' such as Jamal could know so much was impossible for those in charge.After an entire night of questioning and what most of us would consider torture, Jamal goes on to explain what circumstances throughout his life brought to him the answers he needed to win the millions. Throughout the flashbacks, as he tells his story, the viewer delves deeper and deeper in to the lives of these gorgeous Indian children whom were orphaned in the slums of Mumbai. As they grew and faced obstacles the majority of the world could not even imagine we are given story lines which are very fresh and original to the typical American audience.Within this movie there is the magic of rooting for the unlikely, for true love, for justice and for mere survival. I wanted to see Revolutionary Road that day because I was feeling pretty somber and actually needed a good cry. Turns out what I needed indeed was a good cry, but through a smile.While I am usually reeled in by characters and dialogue when it comes to my favorites  with Slumdog, I was drawn in by the remarkable cinematography, film editing and soundtrack. The camera work is artistic without being obnoxious. At the beginning of the movie there is a series of aerial shots of the aluminum roofs which cover the slum homes. It was a marvelous view of the massive poverty in which we were about to witness. The direction was just flawless. This is an all around beautifully made film with a beautiful story about beautiful children. So I guess I give it two beautiful thumbs up ;-)",Slumdog Millionaire

534,villanwilson87,Simply Brilliant Film-Making!,10,23 January 2009,"Who would have thought that Danny Boyle would create one of the finest films this year already, and probably one of the best I have watched. Over the years we have seen the different types of brilliant genre picture's that Boyle has directed, e.g. Shallow Grave (Thriller), Trainspotting (Drug-Taking Drama), 28 Days Later (Horror), and Sunshine (Sci-Fi). But then Boyle went out and decided to look for something completely different, and found (bizzarely) a British/Indian Romantic Gameshow picture. As always, it is another 'rags to riches' story of a young boy named Jamal who lives and survives on the streets of Mumbai, and somehow manages to become a contestant on the Indian's 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire' game-show. Jamal (played brilliantly by Skins-Dev Patel), a young child who grows into his teens along with his elder brother Samil, and which depicts the main part of the story towards the love of his life, as Jamal says in the film, ""The most beautiful girl in the world."" Freida Pinto, stars as Letika, and all three (Jamal, Samil, Letika) encounter difficult stages of their life's, and some that change drastically.The film whilst showing the love story unfold between Jamal and Letika, the other part is obviously focused on the game show that Jamal is one question away from becoming a multi-millionaire, until being arrested and accused by the game-show host Prem Kumar (played sneeringly by Anil Kapoor) of cheating. Therefore, Jamal is then put through torture to explain his actions (beware, this film although shares discomfort as well as joy) and admit his wrong-doing, but instead confesses to the Police, how he simply knew the answers to the questions with vivid flashbacks from his childhood past, which is a brilliant piece of film making by Boyle.The films last's just under 2 hours, but it was so riveting and exhilarating, I could never take my eyes of it, as I thoroughly enjoyed every second of it. The score as well by A. R. Rahman is also one of the best I've heard and was perfectly set in tone for the film throughout, which also gives you a great insight into India's culture and lifestyle, with some of the most gorgeous camera scenes you'll see this year.All of the characters in the film are brilliant, and with a bit more depth (e.g. where was Letika's family before meeting Jamal and Samil?), but that shouldn't bother you as the film goes through humour, despair, and to simply the feel good factor, because at the end of the film I can guarantee you will have the biggest smile on your face you wont be able to get rid of.Credit to Boyle though, he has chosen a difficult and different challenge in film-making but has pulled out his finest film to date, and since the film has already won Golden Globe's for Best Film and Best Director, it is a firm favourite (in my and everyone's else opinion) for the Oscar's as it has already been Oscar nominated in 10 categories.A thrillingly upbeat film which you can never get bored off and watch in admiration again and again, simply brilliant.",Slumdog Millionaire
535,WeeWillie,A crackling good story about the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,9,29 November 2008,"Clever, quirky, romantic, colorful, good story, good action, and violent at times - ""Slumdog Millionaire"" has it all, and I am sorely tempted to give it a 10/10. It also sports a lively sense of the absurd - although this is latent and based on the unfolding of events! The movie is set in India, with protagonist Jamil as an unlikely candidate in the Indian version of ""So You Want To Be A Millionaire"". The gameshow is used to signpost the ""slings and arrows of outrageous fortune"" on Jamil's life and on his relationship with his love, Latika.As far as I can see, the movie puts no foot wrong, and it doesn't hurt that the various incarnations of the seductive Latika are absolutely sizzling, all sporting to the nines that exotic beauty that the Indians do so very well! This movie crackles, and I recommend it for anyone with a pulse!",Slumdog Millionaire
536,WalkThatTalk,Darshan do ghanshyam - India at the centre stage,10,18 January 2009,"This movie is the best film of 2008 and is destined to sweep many awards , deservingly a couple of Oscars as well. It was a true cinematic treat from Danny Boyle (from Trainspotting), who has been able to bring out wide array of human emotions draped in Indian style but with a taste for universal audience. Firstly the script is every bit as interesting as a murder mystery and keeps one on his toes, a true genius from Vikas Swarup (debut novelist from India- novel ""Q&A""). Boyle doesn't go wrong anywhere from start till the end, be it the choice of the cast, the locations, the music (A.R. Rahman). The cast with small kids (espically Shyam) is truly exceptional, and so is the main lead(Dev Patel) and Irfan Khan. The movies reaches to every nook and corner of Dharavi (biggest slum in Mumbai) and tells the story of all the thousands orphans, and the tormenting life they go through.Story of a kid from slum, survives and fights his way to the top with nothing but hope. Being an Indian, i am rather sad to admit that most of it is not far from reality but i do hope that movies such as this one can help bring the wider attention to such problems and help the cause. I would certainly say that movies such as this one are rare and should be treasured.",Slumdog Millionaire

It's a good story, and all the elements that make a good story are there. Unless you're some racist, mouth-breathing, tobacco-chewing hick from the hills of wherever, you should be able to sit down and watch this movie without feeling like 2 hours of your life was robbed. (These days, that alone is worth the price of a rental.) All in all, on an absolute scale of one to ten - with 10 being the greatest piece of cinematic art ever put to film in the history of all humankind, and a one being a piece of mindless garbage like Death Race or something similar - this movie probably rates a solid six.It's good, sure. But it's definitely not one of the greatest movies of all time.",Slumdog Millionaire
538,kandotom,a social commentary on the conditions depicted in this movie,9,14 February 2009,"The movie is admittedly excellent, and real. What gets us, though, is the nearly unanimous use by reviewers and commentators of happy words like ""uplifting"" and ""exhilarating"" to describe this movie. Instead, I would use words such as ""scary"" and ""nightmarish."" The conditions depicted in this film are like Dante's inferno. The poverty and squalor of vast tracts of Mumbai, a typical Indian mega-city. Shanty cardboard towns as far as the eye can see. What we are shown is the Armageddon to which the world may be coming, due to over-population and a globalized growth economy. People living on giant waste disposal dumps the size of mid-size American towns, like scavenging vultures. Human anthills. The horror of garbage-infested streams in which people bathe, a child escaping through feces. The terror of murderous tribal strife, in which people torch each other to death. Child kidnappers who burn out their victims' eyes to make them more effective beggars. Then the grotesque contrast with billion-dollar luxury skyscrapers inhabited by millionaire gangsters. This is uplifting? The movie deserves Oscar nominations, and even an Oscar or two. But uplifting? No. Frightening and horrific, yes. Tom and Anita Kando, Sacramento.",Slumdog Millionaire
539,ankurjayawant,Over-hyped and clichéd,2,14 February 2009,"Only a few films live up to their hype e.g American Beauty, No Country for Old Men, Brokeback Mountain etc. I was eager to see how this one was and I was infuriated. Anyone who has no idea of India, will after viewing this film think that India is an anarchy where cops play cards while watching men burning alive and chase street kids right upto their houses. The same person will also think that India is a morally corrupt nation where winning contestants on a game show are handed over to the police for third degree torture and where the audience laughs in delight when crass comments are passed on the contestant's poverty. Has Danny Boyle even watched the Indian version of Who wants to be a Millionaire? Mr. Bachchan was the most courteous towards all the contestants. He won everyone's heart with his humility. Anil Kapoor here makes the viewer want to punch him in the face. Plus the uneducated protagonist of the film who speaks British English! Wow! And this despite the fact that all around him speak in Indian English.The most angering aspect was the portrayal of the magnanimous hindu community who prey upon the hapless(!) Muslim minority. And the portrayal of Lord Raam should make the blood boil of any devotee. I dare Danny Boyle to make a similar portrayal of Jesus Christ or Prophet Muhammad. He will be promptly butchered.And also all street children don't end up in begging rings and gangs. They fall into good hands too. A guy who's Mercedes has been stripped bare pays the accused kid $100?? Talk about the white man's burden in the post modern world!!A blind beggar knows who is on a $ 100 bill?? A teenage Salim knows Colt 45? Indians are film crazy but no one will jump and wade through excreta to get an autograph of any film star. Plus, is the name of the third musketeer so unfamiliar that one has to pose as a question for Rs 2 million????? And whats the fuss made about Freida Pinto's performance?? Her performance was even more insipid than the rest of the cast. How can a battered girl who is not allowed to step outside drive?? And does Salim's heart change when he sees his lil' bro win millions?? Why cant he escape himself? And can a man who has won two million in a game show go unnoticed in CS Terminus, one of the most crowded places on earth? The only saving grace are the child actors. They are a welcome relief in this otherwise insipid film.Had this movie been made by a Bollywood director or even some prominent Hollywood director, it would have been labelled as trash which it is. And I'm shocked at the academy. Yes, AR Rehman should win at least one, but that's it. But then what do you expect from Oscars which can ignore a movie like Dark Knight? Or which can award a hideous Chicago best picture in place of the Pianist? I think this time the tradition will be followed. And I'm aghast by the overwhelming approval by western audiencesget a life, guys and leave India alone if you cant portray it correctly.",Slumdog Millionaire
540,greenbeavervideo,Shame on you Oscars,1,14 July 2009,"After seeing this movie, I think members of the Oscars should be arrested and interrogated for suspicion of fraud. As others have pointed out, this film is part of a continuing trend of the Oscars trying to shove mediocre movies down our throats. It is as though the intentions of this movie were good enough to make it a ""great"" movie.First off, this movie asks way too much of its audience as far as suspension of belief. This is fine with a sci-fi or horror movies, but for a highly touted Oscar winner that claims to be a gritty drama portraying an often ignored part of a big society, it really goes overboard. The coincidences that you are asked to accept are just beyond human comprehension. I used to watch the American version of Who Wants to be a Millionaire, and to suggest that an uneducated homeless guy could win because just about every question is related to something obscure that happened a long time ago in his life, and which he happens to conveniently remember, is just ludicrous. Please, the coincidence of the little kid in God Rama custom was just laughable, and when movie critics decide they hate a movie, this is the kind of stuff they pounce on, but in this case, a clear example of complete amateurism is ignored.And don't get me started about the TV host character. He blatantly belittles the contestant about being poor, again and again and again, with no subtlety whatsoever, just straight out laughs in his face while millions watch on TV. He is part of a collective that makes taking this film seriously completely impossible.Somewhere between 20 to 30 minutes into this movie you realize how the rest of the movie is going to go. Those who you think will end up together, do. The characters you expect to die, do. The only thing that kept my interest was the notion that, since this was a critically acclaimed movie and a foreign movie, they would not cop out and do a Hollywood ending. I guess I was wrong. And maybe it's an Indian tradition, but what was the deal with ending the movie with a completely irrelevant dance number??? I know they did something similar in ""There's Something About Mary"", but that was a comedy!! Can you imagine a dance number at the end of ""Crash""?Another thing that bugged me was the so called love story. It was a big part of the second half of the movie and it just destroyed any sliver of credibility the plot still had at that point. The main character suffers from what I like to call ""Hugh Grant Syndrome"". This is when a movie gives us a male character who has a nonsensical, and self deprecating, obsession with a woman who obviously doesn't like him and even goes out of her way to hurt him just to show him how much she's not into him, but then the guy, against all logic, persist and eventually wins her. These movies have the audacity to asks us to see these stalker, unhealthy, relationships as ""romantic"" and ""endearing"" when any adult with half a brain knows that women like this (or any person for that matter) don't change over night and that the relationship is already doomed. The girl in this movie, except briefly when they were playing around as kids, never showed the same level or type of interest that the guy does through out the last half! She always followed whatever would allow her to survive. The only time she actually seems to want to be with him as much as he does with her is when he has fame and money. This is supposed to be romantic?I decided to see this movie, despite the obvious red flag that this was hyped by the Oscars, because I wanted to see something different, something that would give me more insight into what I regard as a fascinating culture. In spite of the great cinematography and look of the film, all I got was a bunch of Western stereotypes wrapped in a silly and substandard plot. This was the best movie of 2008?!?! Really?!?! I thought ""The Wrestler"" was a better movie, and it wasn't even nominated!!!! Only the Hollywood elites don't see the big disconnect between their taste in movies and that of movie fans. In a move that reeks of desperation they are adding more nominees to the Oscars categories in an attempt to keep the ceremonies' ratings from going down the toilet even more. They don't get it, it's not about quantity, it's about quality, or in this case, lack of quality.",Slumdog Millionaire
541,ceche,The beauty of excess,10,10 October 2009,"Young Jamal, born and raised in the slums of Mumbai, is one question away from winning the top prize at ""Who wants to be a millionaire?"", but how did he get that far? The first time I saw a Danny Boyle film, ""Trainspotting"" to be precise, I felt awful, as if the crude depiction of Scottish poverty had opened a dark abyss in my soul. I tried again with ""A life less ordinary"", which the critics hated and I absolutely loved, mainly because of the eye-opening ""irony gone wild"" experience it was for me in regard to the famous saying ""men are from Mars, women are from Venus"". Excess, a typically Boylian trait, is also the essential premise of ""Slumdog Millionaire"", although it takes on a very different meaning, as opposed to Boyle's earlier work. In the slums of Mumbai excess is nothing if not crude reality itself : the filth, the hollowing despair and the merciless violence which reign over the people who are trapped in that life all add up to this disturbingly realistic portrait which Anthony Dod Mantle's brilliant photography empathizes with. However, you might feel, at this point, that I'm describing a very well-made documentary and let me tell you immediately that is not so. A story like this one needed to fly by letting imagination run wild with its creative force and only a director prone to excess by definition and, at the same time, morbidly attracted to the darkest depths of civilization could pull off the task at hand. Luckily, Danny Boyle was the perfect man for the job and the final result is, in my opinion, a masterpiece in the contemporary panorama of the art of cinema. A special mention goes out to Chris Dickens's nail-biting editing and to A.R. Nahman's score, literally capable of controlling the blood flow of any human being subject to its rhythm. On the other hand, Simon Beaufoy's script gets rid of any form of rhetoric, seeps through that particular kind of humour which allows the audience to laugh in the very midst of tragedy, winks at Bollywood near the end, speaks through the eyes of a child in the first part and constructs a sturdy family drama with an epic feel to it in the middle. The actors, virtually unknown on our side of the world, are excellent and the crown jewel is the young Dev Patel, who plays the main character Jamal, whose intensity manages to get across what an interminable number of pages of monologuing could not. While the end titles rolled I was flustered and overjoyed, red with excitement and dancing to the music against my rational self and my suggestion to all of you, before I bring about my final thoughts on this film, is to go and watch this in a cinema (or movie theatre, whatever they call it these days) in order to get the full experience of this mind-blowing tale. Another major player in the current award season is ""The curious case of Benjamin Button"" and if you catch both films I encourage you to reflect upon the concept of ""epic"", they stand for two diametrically opposite ideas of what such a concept should mean. I do not presume to lend you golden drops from the tree of wisdom, but I would still like to base my final comment on this aspect. It seems clear to me that this film has an epic feel to it, since it's ultimately a long and star-crossed love story, transcending the immense suffering of he who treads the path to get ""from slums to success"", in the words of histrionic and ambiguous TV show host Prem Kumar and ascending to the role of constant guiding light in every heroic gesture, unconventionally speaking, made by Jamal.",Slumdog Millionaire
542,jones-ben42,Good...Yes. Best Picture...No.,7,18 February 2011,"Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad film, but it just seemed to unrealistic for me to get over. It's got a lot going for it: great acting, a pretty interesting story, great direction, cool editing (video and sound), great cinematography, etc. It's an academy pleaser, but it's a shame they failed to notice the glaring unrealism in the premise.I'll keep this short, given that everything aside from this point in the movie was very good. I can't help but notice how coincidental the questions were in the show, and that they just so seemingly coincided with memories he remembers. Some of the things he remembers I can understand, like the God Rama, or whatever it was, question, given that it was the day when his mother died. But does he really remember so far back as to giving a poor kid a 100 dollar bill and then the kid tells him that Ben Franklin is on the bill? I don't know about him, but I probably wouldn't remember something as simple as that. Also, the question about who created the revolver still puzzles me. Just because a Colt .45 is named after Samuel Colt does that really mean that he created the revolver? I mean one of the choices names was ....something...... Revolver. I mean that's not a common last name, but if I were to create something, I'd name it after myself, not out of greed, but just so people can know subconsciously that someone with my name created it. Maybe I would just want to be nice to people on game shows, I don't know. Another main one though is how the final question of the show just so happened to be the question he was asking when he was a young kid, and he never learned the answer to, and how the movie simply avoids telling us the answer to this question. Then when Jamal is on the phone with Latika, he seems so sure that she knows the answer. Why? She never gave any reason to imply that. But then she says, ""I don't know, I've never known the answer."" Jamal was the one who asked it a couple times at the beginning of the movie. But the way she forms her words implies that WE were suppose to believe earlier on that she knew who it was but never said. Are you confused? Yeah me too. This is all nitpicking, but that's what I do best in a movie, and when seemingly impossible odds are met and surpassed in a film, it sets me off. The movie's excuse would probably be something like, ""It is written,"" but that's just an excuse for contradicting writing. Anyway, the last thing that I didn't get was why Salim put all his money in the tub, then proceeded to get in the tub of money to die. What this suppose to symbolize something that I missed. If you know the answer, then good for you, but it never made sense to me.Once again, it's not a bad movie, but I will say it is very overrated and did NOT deserve to win Best Picture or some other of the Oscars it won. Worth one watch. If you're big on movie romances, then maybe a couple watches. This movie is no means a masterpiece though, check out 127 Hours; it's by Danny Boyle as well and is far superior in my opinion.",Slumdog Millionaire

Now, back to the ears, they are bloody annoying, aren't they, maybe even more than this crappy movie. The only reason i gave this movie a three out of ten is because of the Indian scenery, because the movie was so poor i could spend my time sightseeing.

To me it is one of the five best films of ALL TIME! The dramatic mechanism in this film is almost perfect. By that I mean the way the we are drawn into the plot of the total underdog winning all (classic theme) when he came from the Mumbai slums. The essence of good storytelling is the 'believable coincidence"" and this film has us believing. But more than that, to make a truly great, classic film you need dramatic scope and this is where this film exells. The emotions that are invoked are huge. Finally the visions and lessons of a civilization in transition (India) are very real. I was waiting for everyone to clap at the end of this film.

545,The_Film_Addict,"""Slumdog Millionaire"" is an impressive, visceral piece of film-making that captures the romance of a memorable movie going experience.",10,4 January 2009,"What begins as a ferocious, gritty film initiating the likes of a Martin Scorsese crime drama, quickly catapults itself into one of the most endearing films of the year. With the energy of a high octane thriller, to the subtle, tender romance of young love, director Danny Boyle's operatic ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is an impressive, visceral piece of film-making that captures the romance of a memorable movie going experience. From the violent opening, to the Bollywood-like dance number at the end, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is without a doubt one the year's best.Using his life's experiences to successfully answer questions on India's version of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?,"" Jamal Malik (Dev Patel), is one question away from landing the game's top prize: 20 million rupees. As soon as the show's ticking clock runs out, Jamal is immediately taken into police custody where he is brutally interrogated when he is accused of cheating. Carefully taking the time to explain his situation to a police inspector (played by Irrfan Khan), Jamal reminisces about his nostalgic childhood with his brother Salim, and childhood sweetheart, Lakita, and explains his true intent on why he's on India's highly watched television show: to find his love, Latika, who is a fan of the show.A story of this magnitude could have easily been told within the conventions of a mediocre romantic thriller that reeks anything Hollywood has attempted to produce in the last 10 years. Instead, director Danny Boyle, who gave drug addicts their will in ""Trainspotting"" and zombies their aggressive agility in 28 Days Later, has crafted a film of the highest caliber by injecting it with a heavy doses of heart-pounding excitement. Boyle's camera captures the dilapidated backdrops of ""Slumdog Millionaire"" in a new light by showcasing a devastatingly poverty stricken India, which is emotionally heartbreaking yet oddly engaging. Boyle, once again, proves that a film doesn't need expensive visual effects and overpaid movie stars to be a powerfully emotionally enthralling film. Boyle's technique is superb and it's evident in every inch of this film.Set within the beat down slums of India, outside the comforting, pleasing film aesthetics most films opt for, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" creates a visually stimulating environment by igniting every frame with fantasy like elements. Though grim undertones prevail the film, ""Slumdog Millionaire"", in the end, leaves one with a euphoric feeling of enlightenment. With the illustrative cinematography of Anthony Dod Mantle, Boyle not only captures a striking narrative; but a voyeuristic, genuine way of life that is rarely captured on film. Unlike most films, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" doesn't allow it's audience to remain passive; instead, it's energetic power grabs a hold of you and doesn't let go. It's breathtaking.With their first full length under their belt, Dev Patel and Freida Pinto bring soaring vitality to the roles of Jamal and Latika. Because the story is structured as a thriller with tiny hints of a Shakespeare love story, Patel and Pinto add a fiercely energetic boost to the picture through their charm. Established Bollywood actor Anil Kapoor fills the role of the conniving game show host Prem Kumar, who unleashes a threatening bag of tricks toward Jamal.Because ""Slumdog Millionaire"" features pitch perfect direction and noteworthy performances, the film leaves audiences sucker punched by its astonishing amazement. It's a dazzling, pulse pounding film that'll have you cheering with joy. Boyle, throughout the years, has delivered a versatile amount of work; all of which pertains to people that are trying to survive. To date, Danny Boyle has crafted a film of epic proportions, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is a masterpiece that is sure to be talked about in years to come.",Slumdog Millionaire
546,Dmagic5000,Slumdog Millionaire is one of the Most Incredible Movies I Have Seen in Years,10,17 February 2009,"Slumdog Millionaire is compelling, incredible and wonderful. The awards and recognition that it is receiving is definitely deserving and i cant wait to see it swoop up more. Eighteen year old Jamal Malik is having an amazing answering streak on the Indian version of the television game show, ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"". He's only one correct question away from the big prize. However, some, including those associated with the game show, question how someone like Jamal, a self confessed non-genius who grew up in the slums of Mumbai, can be doing so well on the show when others who are brighter, more educated and wealthier than him have failed. Is Jamal cheating? Is it purely luck that they have asked him the questions to which he knows the answers? Seeing Jamal's life journey to this point ultimately answers these questions. His life journey includes being orphaned at an early age; growing up with an older brother, Salim, who was both his guardian/protector and antagonist; and having a relationship since childhood with another orphaned child, a girl named Latika. His motivation for being on the show also may provide some answers to his success. Perhaps it was all just meant to be.Anyone who remembers when ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"" first came on here, everyone was fixated on it. It was one of the most popular shows on TV. I think everyone was on the edge of their seats when John Carpenter became the first millionaire. Slumdog Millionaire brings back those feelings. As it shows the country watching Jamal play the game it brings back the memories of sitting and watching someone win in the show.The actors are all pretty well unknown. However, Slumdog Millionaire will make them known. They were all so good and so compelling and complex and engaging it was just mesmerizing. The two leads were perfect though Jamal and Latika were played so brilliantly that it was just amazing. The romance feels real and you feel for the two characters. If the romance in a movie doesn't feel real then the whole movie just falls apart luckily in this movie that wasn't the case.Danny Boyle's directing was great. He made great shots and thats really the most important thing. He chose the right actors directed them in good performances and just did everything so perfectly. The last sequence of the movie is so perfect and it fills you up with such joy and it really touches your heart it is really quite amazing. His very last shot in the film is one of my favourite shots of the movie it is just so well done and so gorgeous, it's hard to put into words.The music was great and it fit so well. I think right now it's my choice for best score at the Oscars. It's beautiful and fitting and makes the movie very enjoyable.But really what makes the movie work is the relationship between Jamal and Latika. You see throughout the years Jaml continually rescuing her but only having her getting snatched away again. His ultimate desire to rescue and be with her is ultimately what makes the story so engaging. It almost plays like ""Rocky"" where in the end it doesn't really matter if he answers the last question right or not as long as he gets the girl. It is what moves the movie from a good movie to an incredible movie.In the end Slumdog Millionaire is just one fantastic movie. It's one of the most incredible movies i have seen in years. Im sure it's going to win Best Picture at the Oscars and rightfully so. If it is playing in your town then you should definitely not miss it and go see it. This is one compelling and amazing movie.

But, the major problem in the movie is the list of negative events happening to the main characters. Their is NOTHING positive that comes across these children and no helping hand witch I feel shows Indian people to be non-charitable and not helping. I feel that yes it shows the dark sides of India but what about the positive things in India. The movie is very cliché and you know what is going to happen next. The grown actors don't have much dialogue compared to the children. Freida had barely 10 minutes in the film and her character was not well developed.

However, it stands among very good company: Luis Buñuel's classic ""Los olvidados"", and Cidade de Deus. Having said that, Slumdog Millionaire introduces some original elements, specially the way the story is told. The main character is Jamal, a young Muslim boy from the slums. He enters a very popular game show: ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"". Jamal is an unlikely contestant, coming from the slums and without proper schooling. He does not fit the typical demographic profile of the show's contestants. However, as he is asked the questions, Jamal remembers his various growing up experiences, having flashbacks of his past, putting together a challenging and tragic life story. The Show Host, thinks he is cheating and calls the police on him. He is tortured and while explaining how he came to the answers, he recounts his brutal life. The story is about two brothers (Jamal and Prem) and a female friend (Latika). They share cruel tragedies that mark them from a very early age, becoming orphans and having to survive in the ruthless urban slums. Jamal and his brother take different routes in life. While Jamal works, Prem becomes an enforcer for a mobster. But before the brothers separation, in typical Cain treachery, Prem takes away Jamal's female friend and only love, Latika. Throughout the movie, Jamal is obsessed with her and his attempts of trying to find Latika become an fundamental part of the story. There is some fine acting, specially by the kids. I am sure movie lovers will want to buy the DVD as soon as it comes out.",Slumdog Millionaire
553,sghnmbjb,A movie simply made to Denigrate India.,1,12 March 2009,"I sincerely do hope that my comment gets published because I really want it to!. Firstly, I am an Indian, lived in India for 22 years before moving to US. Moreover, I am a proud Hindu if that makes any difference. And Yes, I am a proud worshiper of Shri Ram. Anyone who has a minute understanding of Hinduism will testify what was shown about him in the movie was incorrect. Anyway, in my entire life I have never gone chasing around ""Innocent"" Muslims. We will come to that later. I am not surprised that this particular movie won these many Oscars and that the movie was made when the government in India is a pseudo-secular supporting party. No wonder the victim was shown to be a Muslim, the Muslim Music Director and Composer who had a field day abusing the image of India won Laurels and Oscars Abroad!.Secondly, the issue about Poverty. Yes, limbs are cut off people to make them beg in India. Yes, there is poverty present. But I have a simple question to ask?. Isn't there poverty abroad in US or UK?. Please don't tell me otherwise as I have been to Detroit, Michigan and South Chicago. For a while I was also at Downtown Los Angeles. At least a poor in India can walk safely in the night but I am not sure it would be that safe from the Homeless in Detroit, Chicago, LA or Downtown New york. My message is this,Get over it West!. 10% of US population is homeless. If call centers and software weren't outsourced to ""Third World"" countries like India where the currency is artificially manipulated to be undervalued to help the almighty Dollar (Wasn't a 100 dollar bill shown in the movie?), much of the west would have already been on the streets by now. And yes, looking at the current Recession that would be inevitable it seems. Entire world knows how rich the west is when most of the Banks in US are bankrupt. Let me not go into our former ""Colonial power"" UK where I have heard that the situation is even worse.Let me tell you one fact to the West whether you believe me or not. The Liberal Left Political party in India, The Congress party has ruled India for 90% of the time. They have encouraged(in fact promoted by all efforts) unimaginable poverty, slums, Muslim ghettoization because every 5 years during election time they ask them for their votes promising the gullible Indian population that this time they will improve their pathetic poverty but they do not. And now they have the audacity to promote this movie and attack the Hindu population who are largely tolerant and hard working but follow the disgusting caste system. (But believe me Caste System is NOT responsible for today's India). It is not a MATTER of pride for us that India is poor. Everyday we cry wishing that someday we can eliminate the poverty in India vis a vis China. But this movie sadly promotes the agenda of the liberal left in India to continue to rule and to make sure that India remains poor.",Slumdog Millionaire
554,omarramonmuniz,Slumdog is wildly overrated,6,22 January 2009,"Slumdog Millionaire presents a refreshingly original concept, but it fails when it plays like a typical action romance. The main problem is that the screenplay follows the same formula that so many other big-budget action romances follow with two major exceptions. One, we have Indian characters, not American (it gives the film a special allure). Secondly, the story is told in non-linear fashion. But the formula is the same. One of the biggest problems in the writing is that everybody except for the two main characters is a villain. Key characters are one-dimensional and that's far too easy to write. For example, everybody with the exception of three key characters are pure evil and even then, one is mostly evil. It's lazy and a way to spoon-feed the audience. It's easier for audiences to identify some one as wholly good and another as wholly evil. Writing complex characters causes more ambiguity and it might make audiences think!Secondly, Slumdog suffers from what I'll call ""Inverse Deus Ex Machina."" Instead of characters always being saved by the bell, these characters are always being harmed by the bell. Just when you think something good will happen, something bad happens to increase drama. This is a problem when it happens at every single opportunity it gets except one. Another problem is a philosophical one. Jamal searches for his true love, a girl that he barely spent any time with making it hard to legitimize this destined love. Now, this can work by giving the main character a reason to love a girl he barely knew. Maybe she reminds him of innocence or maybe she was the only purely good person he ever knew. But the movie does not justify this distant and unknown love, they simply expect us to believe that the overly passionate Jamal would be so unbelievably attached to a stranger and vice versa. Boyle also applies some annoying gimmicks to this film. Almost every other shot is canted dutch (camera tilted at an angle). Critics seem to confuse this as art but it's simply aggravating. The Third Man is the only film that can use canted dutch shots nearly as much as Slumdog did, although it still does it less. Also, every time it happens in 3rd Man, there's an obvious reason for it. Here, there's no reason other than to create never-ending chaos, even during the calm scenes. Also, Boyle doesn't something extremely elementary. He changes the positions and colors of the subtitles, especially throughout the earlier scenes. This is a way of telling the audience, WE KNOW YOUR ATTENTION SPAN IS TOO SHORT TO READ BLACK AND WHITE SUBTITLES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN, SO WE'LL APPLY COLORS AND MAKE THEM MORE VISIBLE BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THE American AUDIENCE WILL WATCH THIS. Man on Fire and El Cantante also did this, I believe for the same reasons, and it's unnecessary. Trust the audience. They're only dumb if you treat them as such. And I won't even get into the end credits. I'll just say this isn't 40 year old virgin, this movie can't pull that off. Also, Boyle has a nasty habit of playing popular, modern songs non-diagetically against scenes that take place well before the song was made. I may be nit-picky here, but this too is unnecessary, sloppy film-making. More importantly, Boyle exhibits a petty reliance on music, making most of the movie feel like a really expensive music video. Slumdog fails to capitalize on the most interesting character in the film. THE SLUMS. There's a brief moment in the film where the camera is sitting on a tri-pod, there isn't any wacky editing, and a serene song plays. We watch Jamal re-enter the slums. Here, the slums are treated with tenderness and a little nostalgia. The film needs more of this. Ultimately, the great reviews stem from the appreciation of an unusual concept made in a fast-paced, City of God-like environment using incredibly epic scenery of Mumbai slums. Unfortunately, the content, editing and cinematography is treated like a Michael Bay film and the theme (and ending) is one to satisfy an audience of teeny-boppers. Slumdog may very well win best picture this year while a simpler, more thought-provoking and more mature film in The Wrestler isn't even nominated for the award.",Slumdog Millionaire
555,eavan_masters,Excellent movie. Worth a watch.,8,17 February 2009,"Saw this movie a few days ago. Luckily it was good enough to still be fresh in my mind. Actually, the only thing that annoyed me about this movie were the askew camera angles at certain points. They were mainly used during the action sequence at the beginning. I think the quick cuts and music would've built enough tension without the aide of the odd angles, but who knows. The directing was still fantastic. Even more impressive was the music. Most impressive however was the acting. Dev Patel was remarkable. His acting was, well, Oscar worthy. Even the children actors were fantastic. I can't give it a 9 or 10 simply because I didn't feel fully engaged in the the movie until the last 30-40 minutes. Nonetheless, the directing and acting were good enough to captivate me until I got there. Not much more to say about it that hasn't already been said or written. The one thing I'm definitely gonna remember from this movie, Dev Patel. I definitely hope to see more from him in the future.",Slumdog Millionaire

Unfortunately, it fell short of the mark. A ""feel good"" film? Are you kidding me? Points scored for A.R. Rahman's soundtrack and the issues played out in the film, but otherwise, an overrated film reaching slightly above mediocre at best. No way should it have won eight Oscars.

557,leenabr,Heart-Breaking tale of a gutsy SlumKing- exceptional,8,12 December 2008,"Slumdog Millionaire was one of the best movies of this year. Danny Boyle was extremely smart while selecting the cast, theme and music director for this film. It has the art aspect for the West to appreciate the slums of Mumbai, the poverty, corruption, sex all excellently handled. Then there is a love story which would appeal to all audiences around the world. Lastly to put a cherry on the cake there is amazing musical score by A.R Rehman whose talent South Asians absolutely salute If one thinks about the movie a few days after watching it, the story seems pretty customary; a poverty stricken boy from the slums of Mumbai manages to score twenty-million rupees on a television game show purely by case of luck. However what makes this movie exceptional is Danny Boyle's narration of ""why"" this boy manages to win the money, and ""how""- By connecting pieces of his life together and finding the answers through introspection. He is a complicated character with disturbed relations with his brother, and a long lost love from the slums he is still searching for. In the end the movie leaves a lot of messages about youth, innocence, vulnerability, keeping your shoes in a bag and taking them inside the Taj Mahal to avoid theft, not trusting every mineral water bottle seal in restaurants etc. But the one that strikes out is the value of money, and how petty the whole charade is. This boy has no regrets about his life, in fact in their younger versions they show how living in the slums is also a lifestyle, and it doesn't mean people are unhappy if they live there. It's our way of thinking that luxuries are intrinsic to survival that makes their condition look pitiable. Moreover it also makes one realize that money is worth nothing without happiness, even if that happiness vests in one person, one object, or a relation. On the acting department, Dev Patel has done a great job. I was surprised to see him so nervous and slightly immature on his interviews especially with David Letterman, but since he's only eighteen, and just tasted the glamor I'll give him benefit of the doubt. Frieda Pinto does a good job as Latika, although my favorite version of Latika is when she is youngest and befriending baby Jamal. Pinto looks older than Jamal in the movie which she also is in real life. Madhur Mittal as Salim does a fantastic job and has a Mithun touch to his looks and acting. He is superb in his role. The main flaws in this movie are in Anil Kapoor's character. Hosts of such shows have been Amitabh Bachchan and Shahrukh Khan and never have they made fun of a guest, mocked them openly and humiliated them. So I don't understand why Anil Kapoor's character was shown to be soo cocky. One other thing I did not like was how Latika had been made a complete prostitute/slut who if imagination may run wild would have slept with 50 people before finally meeting Jamal, and despite everything he treats her like they just met and nothing ever happened. With someone whose gone through soo much, himself and her included, things take a while to get to normal and settle. If she was as in love with him as he was why didn't she ever bother looking for him like he did? why did she go anywhere money called at her? Well these questions crossed my mind but may vary for everyone. Overall the flashbacks in the first half of the movie were superb. Hats off to the little actors who played their characters exceptionally well. The music made it all more entertaining and groping. There was no need for the dance sequence at the end, it almost ruined it. Maybe because none of the leads could dance, or maybe because it didn't do justice to bollywood dances which are superbly choreographed and extremely well performed. Overall, great movie, sort off artsy just believe the story and you won't be disappointed.",Slumdog Millionaire
558,ramchandar_gl,Forrest Gump comes to India,9,3 January 2009,"Slumdog chronicles the life of Jamal who is born in the slums of Bombay. His life journey takes him through some of the dark aspects of India during the 90's. Starting from the forced child begging to the '93 Hindu Muslim riots and the notorious Bombay underworld, the movie reveals everything that is nasty about the country. So why should anyone watch this movie? Well, its because of the amazing screenplay which keeps the viewers interested till the very last moment - and the thrill is not about whether or not Jamal wins the 20 million. Its more about how he gets there. In addition to the screenplay some of the other outstanding aspects of the movie include 1. music by A R Rahman is top notch. 2. casting (Loveleen) was amazing. Especially the 2 child actors who played Jamal. Their resemblance to Dev Patel (as grownup Jamal) was simply uncanny. 3. acting was apt. Nobody overdid their part and thats just what this movie needed. As any other Indian watching this movie, I couldn't help wonder why the movie focuses only on Slums, underworld and other dark areas of India. Why are only such movies critically acclaimed in the West? Is it probably because that is our only USP at this point - which is sad considering 'Salaam Bombay' made 20 years ago offered the same. Don't we have anything else other than Slums and Gandhi?9/10.",Slumdog Millionaire
559,janebrownrigg,"Slumdog Millionaire is a brilliant., genre jumping revelation",9,29 November 2008,"Slumdog Millionaire is a genre jumping revelation that comes across as bizarrely plausible when events that seem impossible are contextualised in flashbacks that illustrate the life of our 18 year-old hero Jamal (Dev Patel), an orphan from the slums of Mumbai. Jamal has entered the Indian version of ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"" in an effort to contact his lost love Latika (Freida Pinto). Much is made of Jamal's lowly status as a chai wallah (tea boy) at one of Mumbai's many call centres.This underdog status helps him to win the hearts of the viewing audience but arouses suspicion from the show's host, who pulls strings and has Jamal arrested and savagely interrogated when the show breaks at the end of the day's episode. Slumdog Millionaire jumps back and forward in time illustrating the parts of Jamal's life experience that have taught him the information he needed to correctly answer questions on the show. Much kudos must go to the cast and crew for uniformly excellent performances, filmed in often harsh and immensely difficult circumstances. Resourceful and resilient, once orphaned at a young age in a religious uprising, Jamal and his older brother Salim (Madhur Mittal) travel widely in their quest for safety and survival. The boy's hair-raising, and often hilarious, exploits on Indian railways and at the Taj Mahal are played out against marvelous scenery. Slumdog Millionaire successfully combines many genres such as history, 'road' trip, crime, coming of age, romance and quiz. All are deftly handled and interwoven in a total package that is hard to fault. Stay through the closing credits and you even get a Bollywood style dance number! Brilliant.",Slumdog Millionaire
560,bodhistore,Excellent work Mr Boyle!,10,27 December 2008,"This movie is really a masterpiece and the directing is brilliant! I've dealt with slum kids in India, and the film really depicts their resourceful nature with great accuracy. Its a movie about good, evil, greed, and innocence - and most importantly, about hope. Really, although fictional it could almost be a documentary about the many shanti towns in Bombay. Rather than wallow in depressing sorrow over their situation, the film deals with the harsh realities of homeless kids in India in a very humorous manner. It also shows two sides of India which is very real: ruthlessness and innocence, all in a huge potpourri. The little kids are amazing, natural, actors in the movie and deserve an award. They are truly beautiful! And there's a lot of funny incidents quite typical for India. The whole story is cleverly intertwining Jamal's life story with his ability to answer the questions in the huge Crorepati (game show) contest. Its quite remarkable that Danny Boyle has been able to depict slum life and the underbelly of Bombay so well, after only being in India for three months! The only criticism I have is that the main characters are too light complexioned to be believable to be from the slum. It would have been nicer to have dark complexioned characters, since light and dark skin is such a deep issues in India.Anyone who sees this movie will be moved by it, and will have a lot of laughs. The added plus is that it also has a happy ending! Go see it and enjoy!Excellent work, Mr Boyle! I think Slumdog Millionaire will end up being at least as popular and widespread as Mamma Mia although its not a musical. It has a happy and hopeful spirit running through it, common in many musicals.",Slumdog Millionaire
561,rayesh_g,A breathtaking and visually stunning movie.,10,18 January 2009,"I must admit that I was a little skeptical in viewing this movie due to the mass hype generated throughout the internet of ""Slumdog"" as a feel good movie. To my knowledge there are lot of filmmakers who use emotions as a gimmick to make audiences embrace a movie despite of major flaws in other aspects of the movie. However it was not the case with Danny Boyle's brilliantly made film. From the very start to the end, I knew I was witnessing a phenomenon of a movie. Based on an acclaimed novel, this movie engages with the audience and keeps them guessing at every moment. Lively and energetic performances ranging from the much younger actors to Dev Patel and Freida Pinto keep this movie running without dying down. The cinematography mixed with great locations and music (composed by A.R Rahman) makes this an unforgettable screen gem of our time.

562,Agent-L,Simply an inspiring movie,10,25 January 2009,"After watching Bakwaas movies such as Ghajini, Welcome, Sing is King (absolutely Bakwaas), Golmaal Returns and Chandni Chowk To China this is truly an outstanding and inspiring movie to watch. Beautifully directed and well written. To those people who are saying this move does not represent real India I suggest they should visit India and one of those slum areas. This movie portrays real life and not Disneyland, but doses it in way which makes us understand the social divide we have in India. Where minority controls the wealth & power and majority live below poverty line, and let's not forget about child labour.Is this movie depressing? NO. It show's us a part of India which I am certain no body is proud of, and tries to explain it by bringing this controversial issue to public which we all like to ignore/oversee.At list this movie is trying to portray less privileged humans who don't have daddy's express account or mummy's chicken biryani to eat everyday. Name me one good Bollywood movie which tried to bring the class/wealth division to the screen without implanting the concept of Romeo and Juliet.I am sorry to disappoint people but this movie doesn't have random song every five minutes nor does it have sexed up vulgar women's with tits out. What it does have it tells the story of two brothers struggling to survive through any means possible. How society exploits them and in the end what it makes each of them. This movie is essentially about how people try to survive through hardship and struggle and still have hope in the end, and how you should never give up. You will not be disappointed when the movie ends.Regardless of what it portrays I have found this movie to be extremely well made inspiring and one of the best I have seen. It has defiantly moved me and also has inspired me enough to believe in hope again. It is ultimately for us (Indian) to change our country for its betterment. It is easy to criticise something from the warmth of your bedroom, but it is another to actually help someone in need. P.S. And when was the time you actually helped one of those slum kids with descent food or clothes? Ask yourself that question before making any kind of criticism.Caution/Warning: This movie requires some USE of something between YOUR two ears called BRAIN.

566,getupday,I understand the controversy.,9,17 February 2009,"I must admit, as a middle of the road, middle-class American male living in the deep-south, I was completely ignorant to the plight of India. In fact, any images I might have retained in my head concerning India usually had Ben Kingsley in them. Or at the very least (and I mean racist least) Apu from The Simpsons. I knew it was a very beautiful place. And I knew it held a certain ""mysticism"" over western minds. But, what I did not know was how dire the slums of India were. There are images from this film that will be with me many years from now. The fact that I left the cinema elated is a testament to how wonderfully moving and uplifting the film actually is. It shows the filth, but, in a very non-Martin Scorsese style, doesn't leave us with just horrendous images of people in dire straights. It actually inspires the soul by showing hope is never truly vanquished. Especially if a person has goal and a journey. True, my heart wondered what became of the mutilated children still left in the slums. And true, I know logically that a population in the billions offers little hope of ""striking it rich"". But, cinema should not be a window into reality. That's what actual windows are for. Cinema should be an ideal reality, a piece of knowledge, a way to educate, and lastly, a way of escape.In closing, I can understand the controversy surrounding this film. It certainly won't help tourism in India. In fact, it might kill it. But, to those with an open mind, it's just the start of a great adventure.",Slumdog Millionaire
567,imdbyes,This movie was nothing but a cliché. It was terrible.,4,13 January 2009,"This movie was a super duper cliché, predictable and obvious. It seemed to be going by the typical cinematic formula. A young kid suffers, and is the underdog that we (as the audience) all root for--he is an honest kid with a heart of gold who must go through tragedy after tragedy---and at the end of the movie--he finds love and millions of dollars. How can we even ""feel"" for these characters when we never even get to know them (besides the fact that they've been through so much). So at the end it doesn't matter one way or another whether he lives or dies. WHy? because I didn't really care for any of them. Why? because we never go to know them. There was no depth to these people , and to this movie. It didn't touch my heart, it didn't move me. It seemed to be more about the way it looked (cinematography, editing, etc). Therefore, it was more flash than anything profound. And too many scenes were trying too hard---they were trying to be ""cutesy"", for example, the toilet scene with the little kid when he's covered in feces---sorry, but I did not find it funny or cute. Actually, didn't evoke anything for me--but I could tell the movie desperately wanted the audiences to laugh out loud. Also, the chili pepper scene (when the little kid get's it thrown in his privates) again, not funny or cute, just kinda like ""whatever""-an if anything, it annoyed me because I could tell the movie was trying too hard. Plus, the whole ""black an white"" thing where there's the ""bad evil"" characters--an the ""good"" characters is just nonsense--life is gray, not black an white. The whole ""WHo wants to be a millionaire"" thing is just a gimmick Danny Boyle used to catch the attention of people--and use it an fairytale way. The premise is very far fetched. The whole movie is contrived. It's very 'on the surface'. If u want to see a real movie--with a third world topic--check out, ""City of God"".

568,telemationltd,Superb Film,9,20 July 2009,"This film will appeal to anyone who loved 'The Pursuit of Happ-y-ness'.However, 'Slumdog Millionaire' is much darker and explores the depths of man's inhumanity to man much deeper. In essence a Shakespearian love story, defined by two brothers contrasting pursuit of love and power respectively.The plot, where Jamal soldiers on answering a series of difficult 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?' questions which coincidentally follow the story of the brothers lives in chronological order at first glance seems unbelievable, until you embrace the concepts of karma and fête, hold on to the expression 'It is written' and understand that he is not there for the money, but for love.Superbly cast, brilliantly directed, filmed and written with an intriguing sub-plot in the developing relationship between Jamal and the policeman (most of which was cut from the movie).Seeing this on DVD there is a good half an hour of deleted scenes, mostly dropped I assume to shorten the film to its still relatively long but highly engaging two hours. I hope Danny Boyle will be invited back to create a director's cut in the near future with at least half of them reinstated. This would make the film a lot easier to follow and clarify some ambiguous points that could be missed if you did not give the dialogue, sometimes hard to interpret to slower western ears, your 100% attention.",Slumdog Millionaire
569,hemal_triv,A great production value but insensible story telling,4,10 November 2008,"I saw this movie yesterday at MIAAC film festival in New York. I had heard great reviews of this film and was really looking forward to watching this film. the first 10 minutes were fantastic! It won't be an exaggeration if I say that it was work of a genius. I told myself that this is going to be a great, Salaam Bombay type of, film. The filmmaker seemed to completely understand the spirit of Mumbai and Mumbaites.But the next hour and twenty minutes of the film were a disaster. Every clichéd and stereotype imaginable about India, Indian class struggle, Indian religious struggle was reinforced in the film in an even more exaggerated form. Every character in the film was either good or evil, black or white. Every system was either fair or unfair. There was no room for nuances and subtleties. The story telling was too much on the surface. For e.g. a scene from '92 riots, where a bunch of Hindu fanatics were attacking Muslims in their slums. That scene was a biggest turn off for me. I was in fact offended by the insensitivity and insensibility of the filmmaker who presented such a big historical tragedy in simplistic and stereotypical way. I have lived through those riots and I know exactly how it feels. It for sure wasn't as simplistic. And the scene where the two brothers were pushed out of the train because they were stealing bread. Common! Give me a break! I have never seen such things happen in India in my entire lifetime. And I've lived in India for most of my life.Also the kind Caucasian couple who graciously gives $100 to Jamal. I've never seen such kind tourists in India ever. I've seen Western tourists sometimes haggle for 10 cents. Forget India I've never seen such a gracious Caucasian exhibiting such kindness even in New York City.And besides that Caucasian couple nobody from the higher economic strata of the society was kind and generous. Everyone was brutal, cruel, conniving...as if there were only two types of people in Mumbai.This was yet another stereotypical Western view of a ""third world country"" gone wrong. I think this film is made purely for the Western audience, so that they feel good about themselves. The film does nothing else but reinforces the stereotypes. And after looking at all these favorable reviews I feel that there is a great divide between the way the West sees the world (or wants to see the world) and the way the world really is. One of the roles of media, in my opinion, is to challenge these stereotypes, whereas this film, to become popular, simply reinforces them. The film in my opinion is shallow, lame and absolutely insensible.I gave it a generous four stars because I loved the cinematography and the performances. But I wish I could give negative points for storytelling.",Slumdog Millionaire
570,tambe,Journey of a Slumdog,10,23 January 2009,"This movie is one of the best movies I have seen. It's a story about the slumlife in Mumbai. The important thing is that Jamal (Dev Patel) dint loose hope in spite that his mother died and he was deceived by his own brother. I felt Salim had a good nature when he was small.Jamal earned a living as a 'chai wala' where as Salim got money doing bad things. Latika was a descent and noble girl, but because of Salim she got into the wrong company. This story is an eye-opener. All the actors acted very well especially Dev Patel (Jamal Mullik) and Frieda Pinto (Latika) Dev Patel should get the award for the best actor.I was really shocked at the treatment meted to the slums. Jamal used his own mind instead of following the answer which Anil Kapoor gave him. Even though Anil Kapoor kept teasing him he dint mind.Even when he phoned Latika, he was more bothered about her than the money.This story tells us that if one is focused in life one can achieve one's goal no matter how many obstacales one faces.It's a beautiful movie",Slumdog Millionaire

572,innatrance,Really Totally Excellent,10,19 July 2009,"It's very very rare I would give a film 10/10, but when you view this with an open mind, the film is basically fully rounded just as the likes of Casablanca. It's full and complete on every level. This of course does not mean perfect. But it's near enough. To summarise it carries all the great qualities - excellent down to earth acting, superb cinematography and directing and editing, great story and script, deep human emotions which capture the heart, appropriate and excellent well timed music and of course action and comical moments. Most importantly throughout and afterwards it leaves one with the increased altruistic wish to help others - great for the bodhisattvas out there! That really is the biggest and deepest beauty of any form of art, film or otherwise. And this hit's the mark deep inside the soul along those lines in so many ways, because indeed it is so real and spiritually stimulating on so many levels. That is finally why it's worthy of a 10. This film is truly divinely blessed! Full marks Danny Boyle and all involved!",Slumdog Millionaire
573,Jim-947,This is an inspiring film.,10,26 December 2008,"A young man, who grew up in a slum, is on one of those television shows where you answer questions to win a lot of money. After each win he has the option of quitting with what he has one or passing the money up for an opportunity to win more. He is a phenomenal success, although he does not seem to care whether he wins or loses.Through flashbacks the viewer learns about his growing up in a slum and of the suffering and degradation entailed in that. Some really terrible things happen to the characters in this tale.There is a love story. This movie has characters you come to care about. It is not like the soulless, puking garbage Hollywood keeps shoveling at us. It is a work of art. See it if you get the opportunity.",Slumdog Millionaire

It is unique, genuine, and tells a wonderful story. Many times I considered watching it but chose something else and when I finally got around to it I was glad I did. It's definitely worth watching!",Slumdog Millionaire
575,xhatitz,Awesome,10,2 April 2020,"A good film that reflects the true nature of Indian society about how people treat each other and how they treat children, a simple but deep film that shows a spark in a dark society.

577,shrinivas_venkatesh,Average Stuff!!,6,25 January 2009,"The other day i was to see SM and honestly seeing the critic's reviews, I thought I will be in for a treat. But trust me, I walked out of the theater quite disappointed. Considering the fact that the film was raved so much that it got 5 on 5 stars by one critic, I really coudn't agree that it was justified. I must say, that some aspects of the film are quite perplexing. Well, how does a bloke, speaking in Hindi for most of the time suddenly speak in English. another bad part is that the script doesn't throw light on things like how Latika reaches the brothel etc. What irritated me the most about this film is that the writer plays with the intelligence of the audience. I say this because most of what you see, simply defies logic. What saddens me is that Danny Boyle paints a very grim picture of India. I would like to prove that with the following examples. 1. The director portrays police as inhuman. But sir, in that case making a film on Guatenamo Bay would yield you better results. 2. The director focuses on how kids are made into beggars. I know places in USA where kids are trained to smuggle drugs. 3. The director shows how little girls are forced into prostitution. In that case, you should make a film on Holland, where prostitutes solicit customers from railway stations and airports. On the whole Danny is quite chauvinistic and doesn't focus on positive things about India. The silver lining is a tremendous performance by Dev Patel. This guy is one for the future. He simply blows you away with his cheeky, yet confident form of acting. The other actors too perform marvelously. Great screenplay and great cinematography are highlights of this film. On the whole, i would say SM is okay for watching once, yet you can't help but feel that this is a glorified masala movie and not one fit for the Oscars of Golden Globe.",Slumdog Millionaire
578,jehrsam,Forget This One,1,2 April 2009,"Slumdog Millionaire is one of the most difficult Academy pictures of the year to sit through. What must they have been thinking to have nominated this movie in the first place? It is not outstandingly acted, has a thin and disconnected plot, and doesn't even tell a good story. Any movie that relies on subtitles (or in this case, ""sidetitles"") is difficult at best and Slumdog is no exception. To the actor's credit, one can almost figure out what is go happening even though the ""sidetitles"" are missed. On the big screen, cannot enjoy the movie and finish reading the ""sidetitles"" before they disappear. On the little screen (and that includes 50 inch HD), the ""sidetitles"" are impossible. One finds themselves watching for where they are going to pop up next and then tries with frustration to read them before the next one pops up on the other side of the screen. This is one to forget and it is a shame that it is even placed on a par with such as Gone with the Wind",Slumdog Millionaire
579,sundeepmukherjee2000,A Charming movie but definitely not Oscar material,9,25 February 2009,"I reviewed the movie on another blog a week before its official release and can safely reiterate NOW what I had told THEN, after 8 Oscars.Its a wonderful wonderful movie. Greatness oozed out of every pores of every department from all the technicians, casts and the crews associated with this movie.But in Indian context, we have seen much better movies than this and so I personally feel it undeserving for its fame.As Boyle commented in Toronto after the pre release screening, there are more movies like this and even better made in India in local language, but if you get a chance to see them with sub titles, it will surely gonna make your day.If you liked Slumdog, please see these Hindi movies, to name a few among a jungle more : A Wednesday, Black Friday, Satya, Company, Shootout at Lokhandwala. And you will realize why when the west is ogling at Slumdog, the East is still weary of it! When 25% of the totalOscars for SM went to Allah Rakha Rahman for soundtrack and lyrics, please lend your ears to the soundtrack of Ghajini or Yuvraj to hear what A R Rahman is capable of otherwise. I personally felt SM soundtrack and lyrics were among his mediocre works. But you need to see them all to know whats the best.For the west when such a movie as Slumdog brings freshness to all the gore around, to east such movies are common and the gore is needed here to make the difference.Thats why the sun rises here and sets there. Two ends can never meet.SM is a great movie but very forgettable in eastern standards as tomorrow we are sure to have a better movie with a better concept and a better soundtrack. It pays to be in tune with reality, so check out the aforementioned movies and then judge for yourself.",Slumdog Millionaire
580,translator_of_t,Fantastic,10,21 May 2009,"ATTENTION: SPOILER...somewhere =.= Maybe it's a bit too late to watch this movie because I've just watched it yesterday. My aunt took me to the cinema and let me choose the movie. I chose Star Trek but she didn't agree and said that she'd watched it enough since 1966. And I explained to her that this is the best version of this series but...no. And I still had to watch Slumdog Millionaire. I'd heard it's a good movie but just see...u come to the biggest cinema in your country (Viet Nam to me) to watch a drama? I'd rather stayed home but she bought the ticket. ""All right, see what u want,Yes, I'm a 14-year-old boy so I have to do what u say, OK...""-I thought. And just in 5 minutes I was attracted to the movie. ""It's quite good""- I thought. A nice place, good music, good camera's angle etc. With a huge bag of popcorn (it's really a huge bag), I started to eat and enjoy the movie in front of the big screen. ""Well, It's worth the price of the ticket...""-I thought when the chase between the bad guys and the kids begin. But when I see the kids stealing the shoes, trainers of the guests in Taj Mahah , I thought: ""Oh dear! I'll never come to this place!"" But it's fun. The most important thing that make the movie exciting is the way it tells the story. Jamal flashed back his life and I could see how he answered all the questions. But I can't believe that everything is so easy, come on, it's just luck. He's a lucky boy but he didn't intend to win 20.000 rupies at first, he just wanted to find his lost love with a little hope that she would see him on TV. But he did it more...I wouldn't say more about the plot, u can go and watch it yourself. Last but not least, If u want to visit India, watch this movie first and be more careful. No offense to Indians but u know, the movie talks about the dark side of a sociality, also love and hope of the people who want to escape from that side...",Slumdog Millionaire
581,nexusfpl,(Almost) perfect,9,2 February 2015,"With the exception of some awkwardly bad scenes, and some exaggeration in the depiction of India's poverty, this movie deserves all the praise it gets, and it's actually quite good.I personally like the fact that this movie is so Indian. No Hollywood star. Only Indian actors. The main character, the guy who plays Jamal, is quite good. He looks very convincing. He does not seem to be acting, he seems to be telling his real life's events. The actors who play young Jamal and young Salim are also very good, though I'd say they are more captivating than talented (after all, they were just children).Now, what was bad about this movie that made it deserve a 9, rather than a 10? The torture scenes were totally unnecessary in my opinion. Maybe the director wanted to show how cruel the world can be to a ""slumdog"" boy who happens to be intelligent, however, to start the movie with such a scene was utterly awkward, to say the least. Other thing I particularly disliked was some scenes of total and merciless cruelty against children, which were of course realistic but did not add to the story, at least not in my eyes.But this movie has some positive aspects that far outdo the negative ones. First off, as I already said, the acting was quite good. None of the actors were bad, but the ""hero"" was the best in my opinion. Quite simply, he ""was"" Jamal. He did not seem to be acting or pretending. Just like every good actor does- he convinces you that what he's living is real. The guy who played Jamal's brother as a young man was also good, as was the girl who played old Latika.Second, the storyline is captivating, you can't help but thinking what you'd do if you were in those boy's places. The fact that Jamal's brother ""betrayed"" him and, in the end, helped to save his life was grand. The brother's death scene almost led me to tears. Third and last but not least, the film has two aspects that all great movies should have: fantasy and a bit of romance. Certainly, it's highly improbable that a guy could ever win so much money answering random questions whose answers he simply ""happened"" to know. This is the fantasy aspect. You have to stop being realistic sometimes, this is a movie, after all. As for the romance, the movie turned out to be a modern love story set in India. Nothing really surprising or new to that, and I must say, contrary to a movie like Titanic, here the romance does not make the movie cheesy or sappy. On the contrary, in the end you actually realize you want the young couple to be together.Now, about the last scene, the ""Bollywood"" scene: some people complain it's cheesy. I think it's fun, to say the least. Surely, the director of the film wanted to make a homage to India's cinema, and he quite succeeded. After all those two went through in their lives, what did they have to lose, why not dance, like children, happy simply for being alive? There's nothing sappy about that, though I know such a ending may look a bit awkward to someone not accustomed to Indian movies.All in all, I'm quite happy with this movie, and I'll certainly watch it again as soon as I can. I am sure it deserved all the recognition it received.",Slumdog Millionaire
582,ajith_jsa,Amazing Movie,9,27 January 2009,"Slumdog Millionaire is the story of Jamal Malik, a slum dweller from Mumbai and his travails that culminates in him landing as the winner of 20 million rupees in a game show and eventually joining is true love.As such, the movie is not a masterpiece or a piece of gem that has been conjured out of thin air. It is a Bollywood movie told Hollywood style.What makes 'Slumdog Millionaire' stand apart is that it is not the run of the mill story that we have been used to over the years. Even in projection of the poverty and the way of life in slums, there is a celebration of the manner in which their conditions are portrayed rather than merely making an attempt to provoke and elicit sympathy of the viewers.The big plus of the movie is its style of narration. Its racy, its engaging and it shifts from one frame to another so fast that your emotional curve will also keep hopping very quickly. Before you start to think of crying, you will be laughing, before you soak in the anguish of the pain or suffering of the characters, you will be intensely absorbed in what is about to unfold next.The movie, as it is originally derived from Vikas Swarup's novel, is a kind of page turner. The editing, screenplay has been woven so well to suit the medium of cinema and keep the interest level of the audience very high without letting them droop even for one moment.For all these reasons, Slumdog Millionaire is notable, yet it is these very reasons that don't make it a hardcore attempt at unraveling the layers of life of the Indian poor.And for the argument of those who say it is a commercial potboiler that exploits the story of the slums to make moolah, they cannot be more wrong. Nowhere has there been an attempt made to glorify the life of its characters in a manner such that it would be deemed as exploitative.Rahman's music is different and vibrant, but it is loud and glaring for the most part. Those who have been mesmerized by the dream music of Rahman will certainly feel it is not his best but who cares? Do the best works always fetch you awards? The awards are more of a recognition of Rahman's talent and it is high time the world took notice of the Mozart of Madras .Cinematography is painstakingly beautiful and suits that vacillating pattern in which the story unfolds. There is one factor that has sat pretty well for the movie though no one will ever want to fathom that connection. Mumbai has been in the news after the 26/11 attacks and so a film with Mumbai as its soul is bound to grab everyone's attention and surely it has grabbed the eyeballs of the Oscar jury by its retina can I say? Everybody in the film has done their role neatly but the pick of the lot was the boy who played the youngest of Jamal, the protagonist of the movie. With his natural performance, abundance of energy and mischievous smile, he steals the show.Go watch it, for it is path breaking in the sense that it will tell Bollywood film makers the way to tell enchanting stories minus the usual formula. Leave all your pretensions and see the film with an open mind and you are bound to enjoy it. After all who will not like to see the rise of an underdog?",Slumdog Millionaire
583,mystery_guy-1,Deserve all its credits.,10,24 May 2010,"This film is my favorite of all time, Yep, I've seen City of God, and if you've seen that too, No need to worry, you should also try this one. The two movies are different to one another, Slumdog Millionaire is a little more of good side of City of God, City of God is much based on reality, which is not a bad thing, While Slumdog Millionaire have that supernatural coincidence, but still realistic, plus its love story is pretty much sweet. The story is perfect, The soundtrack is perfect, The picture is great, The actors were great, I've watched this film with a soft subtitled version so there's no problem about the Subs, But I've tried watching it on a hard subtitle and I must admit, You must be at least 1 meter from the Television to see it, which is unhealthy^^Go and see this movie, this is a must see movie experience, You won't be disappointed, Danny Boyle really did a fantastic job on this one.",Slumdog Millionaire
584,bbqballs,Absolutely Amazing,9,2 February 2009,"This is one of those films that you do not come across very often. It was absolutely amazing. This film is one of the most well written, well directed films I have ever seen. The non-linear narrative was executed perfectly and the plot was astonishing. Every single actor in this film, especially the child actors, played their roles perfectly and the casting was so spot on as it was hard to imagine these characters being anybody else. The character relationship between Jamal and Latika was brilliant and the development of the characters throughout the movie kept you on the edge of the seat wanting to find out what is going to happen to them next etc. The soundtrack (music) in this film was mind blowing, every song selected, every sound effect fitted so perfectly within the film, some moments gave me shivers and goose bumps and the music was so gripping. This movie by far deserves to win the Oscar for best picture and i will not be surprised if it takes out all 10 Oscars it has been nominated for.A definite MUST SEE 9/10",Slumdog Millionaire
585,asylumseeker,"Will make you 'feel good', but lacking in substance",6,1 February 2009,"There are good and bad things about this film. First, the good things. It shows aspects of the reality of slum life in Mumbai that are routinely ignored by 'Bollywood'. In this film, we see the shacks people live in, the way they dry their clothes and how they go to the toilet, and there are allusions to prostitution and to the criminal and communal violence that can be a feature of living in the slums. We also see something of the organised nature of begging and the cruelty of those who control the child beggars. The filming is beautiful, the film is entertaining, and we can all leave on a high and feeling good about how it ends, with its underlying message of the power of love and compassion.However, the key problem with the film is that everything is captured on no more than a superficial level. There are beautiful images in the film of the Dharavi slums and the inhabitants, but they are the kind of images one would expect to see in a guidebook. In other words, these images are taken from the perspective of a tourist, and, like the tourist, the film merely scratches the surface of life in the slum. The superficiality continues in the simplistic nature of the characters and the lack of any real character development. Some of the characters are introduced to simply be one-dimensional 'baddies', such as the gangsters Maman and Javed. The plot itself is contrived, with one question on the game show leading to a 'flashback', another question leading to another 'flashback', and so on. The plot is also implausible in a number of ways. For example, it is never explained how Jamal goes from the slums to a clean-cut looking, English-speaking call centre assistant. Also, the reason for Jamal appearing on the game show is because he apparently wishes to resume contact with Latika, but we are not told how he expects Latika to contact him, given that she is being kept under lock and key by Javed.Despite these shortcomings, there is no doubt that the film manipulates the viewers' emotions in such a way that they 'feel good' after seeing the film, they feel on a high, and they love the film. However, this is a typical feature of many Bollywood films. This is what these films are designed to do. They are there to act like a drug, like alcohol or like sex to give you a kick and to make you feel good. This is not necessarily a good thing because the kick is not going to last. When I walked out of the cinema and into the supermarket, the comedown from the high I felt after seeing this fairytale left me feeling nothing but depression. Watch Slumdog and get your buzz from it, but be ready for the cold turkey as well. Somehow, I think there should be more substance to cinema than this.",Slumdog Millionaire
586,SteveL,What is all the fuss about,1,19 April 2009,"After the Oscars, I was expecting a movie that actually had some merit. Sadly, this is about the worst trash the movies have produced in many years. Boring and oppressively violent, I didn't see any redeeming values, unless you think obsessive exploitation of children is OK. I know some will dismiss my comments with, ""He just didn't get it."" Well, I did get it and this semi-documentary is simply not worthy of any of the accolades heaped upon it. I never ceases to amaze me how films like this advance an unsupported agenda my making the plot hard to follow. Wake up! folks, just because you didn't understand what was going on, doesn't make the move deep or even meaningful. Heartfelt trash is still trash.",Slumdog Millionaire

In order to prove his innocence, he recounts his life story and how its incidental details informed each correct answer.Director Danny Boyle complements this fresh narrative structure with an effusive energy, creating mystery and exciting melodrama. But as the mystery dissolves with exposition, the structure turns predictable and soon collapses in its redundancy. What remains is a long yarn of melodramatic talessome exciting, some heavy-handed but when tallied up, it's fatiguing. Still, the film manages a sweet, uplifting resolution; it's a crowd-pleaser for the less discriminating.",Slumdog Millionaire
588,Luigitoo,"Savage, need a strong stomach",8,1 March 2009,"There is no denying that this is a powerful drama. I have to say that all the awards, nominations and rave reviews paint a pretty picture of this film and its uplifting message. Fine, I accept that, but I was a late viewer of this film and I wish that I had been prepared for the R Rated stuff.I don't usually have a weak stomach, but it was turned by more than one of the brutal scenes in this film. How accurate the depiction is I can only guess, but if the truth is close then it is a sickening portrayal. Clearly my life has been too sheltered if I am disturbed by the graphic and violent scenes, but be warned........ *Spoilers ahead BIG TIME!* Jamal loses his mother when she is beaten to death for being a Muslim, another man is set on fire in front of him, both happen on the same day when he is about 7. His brother appears to be a schizo sociopath, who rapes his best friend and love interest and steals her away from him for the second time out of a total of four. Another orphan friend of his is blinded (graphically) because he can sing and blind beggars make more money than sighted ones.So to all those who are saying wow to the cinematography and directing and message etc etc I agree with all that, the directing especially is excellent, but I did not leave the theatre with a warm feeling of 'it is written' and 'destiny' and the 'strength of the human spirit to overcome'. I am left instead with extremely graphic images of the torture, betrayal, murder and corruption of modern Mumbai. NOT a place I plan to visit Ever and I thank my lucky stars that I was not born to the poverty of the slums of Mumbai. See this movie at your peril or at the very least, follow it immediately with a comedy or cartoon to assist with dumbing down the gag reflex!",Slumdog Millionaire
589,Juliette-10,"Stop reading reviews, just go and see it",10,3 February 2009,"It's finally NZ's turn to see this film and now I totally understand the hype surrounding it at recent award ceremonies.I really enjoyed this film - Danny Boyle and his cinematographers have outdone themselves by managing to capture the 'bigness' of India- the sounds, the sights, the vastness of the landscapes and the sheer amount of people. However the individuals within this place are not forgotten with the nine actors who play Jamal, Salim and Katika doing an outstanding job of making their characters' 'ordinariness' extraordinary.A lot has been made about the way Jamal's story unfolds (in flashback we are shown how this 'cheat' really did know the answers to Who Wants to be a Millionaire). I haven't read the book Q&A on which the movie is based so I don't know whether this is a feature introduced during the screenplay or not. Either way I think it works and stylistically it is very appropriate as it reminded me of Bollywood movies that I've seen.That said it isn't all glitz and glamour and Boyle, as his fans no doubt expect, has not shied away from the darker aspects of slum life. However he does this respectfully and without exploiting his characters. What is perhaps most amazing to me about this film is that, even after showing us the sheer desperation of these characters, Boyle still manages to pull it together for a truly exciting finish.Right now there are vast numbers of positive reviews around about this movie so you will just have to go and see it.",Slumdog Millionaire
590,snehum143,Deserves all the praise it's receiving!!!,10,25 January 2009,"I was hesitant to watch this movie but I am really glad I did! Being Indian, I have watched several Hindi movies and figured all the praise this movie was receiving was because it was different from any Hollywood movie. I thought the experience would not be as memorable for me and that it would be similar to some Bollywood movie I have watched in the past. I was dead wrong. This movie is in a league of its own... a truth people want to ignore. There are moments you want cry and moments you want to laugh. You really feel for the main protagonist, Jamal. His story is unbelievable.What makes your heart stir is the fact that his story of pain is not so fictional to several in Mumbai. This is not merely a story about Jamal on India's Who Wants to be a Millionaire... it's a story about a child who survived the worst obstacles of poverty. On a lighter note, the credits had a refreshing Indian dance typical to many Bollywood movies. It was moving how no one in the theater left. Everyone watched the dance while the credits were displayed.Overall, to say this movie is a must see is an understatement!!!",Slumdog Millionaire
591,prit30,India is not Brazil.,6,12 January 2009,"Shocked! This movie has won 4 Golden Globes. It is crowned high up in Top 250(!) What the hell is wrong with everyone? Who are these critics?From the very beginning this film ""smelled"" City of God. It seems clear that the writer/director had that masterpiece in mind(as many people here have noticed) while making this mere entertainer.I'm Indian and I know this country to the core. This film not only lacks the native flavor it also gives way to some unpardonable medley. It just sounds ridiculous when slum people are speaking English(Slangs in Hindi!)- that makes not a single character in this film something that an intellectual may approve.Evenif you look at it as a great piece of story-telling, there are better ones. Everybody knows. Ask David Fincher!Storyline is not great, flawed actually. Music is good, but A.R.Rahman has given hundreds of better scores. Cinematography is superb. 6/10. No less.

Even some hard scenes to watch, for example the one that little boy had gone blind, it is great. Not only because of the actors, but also the light, the edition, how the camera moves, it's everything.And how the story is triangulated is so creative. Most of Americans movie don't use this artifice, making them so simple. The three vertexes that connect to each other as the movie goes on, made stare at the screen without blinking, wondering why how those fits in the end. It was a perfect combination among Indian story and English direction.I admit that was the first Indian movie that I have seen, but it is the first of plenty that I intend to see now on.",Slumdog Millionaire
593,Horses_rule_da_wurld,Beautiful movie... rated by a teenager,10,11 April 2009,"Okay, before I go on to review this masterpiece, back in 10th grade I took Asian History. And Indian History was one of the Histories taught. Our teacher showed me and my classmates horrid, powerful, disturbing images of India and it's poverty today. So, I was a little prepared for the images to be seen in this movie.On with the review. This movie was amazing, it was totally accurate to what life is like in India. It is so poverty stricken and it really makes you thankful for what you have. I loved the camera movements, and the subplot was good, doing everything in his power, so he can find Latika... very very beautiful and moving.. when they kissed in the end, oh, did I just about bawl my eyes out. All that suffering, and pain, and hurt and poverty... just everything. This movie is moving, but it gives you hope, hope for the future of India...Did you all know that out of the 6 billion people in this world, ONE BILLION live in India? It's so overcrowded, and all these things go wrong all the time there, and this movie couldn't have portrayed that better.This movie, made me so thankful for my mother and father. For all you teens out there who hate your parents, can't wait to get out, go out to parties and get drunk etc etc.... just watch this movie, and you GO and hug your parents. Hug them NOW. I hugged them so tightly after watching this movie... (yes as you can see, I don't like going to parties very much) That beer, my fellow young people, the money for that beer you're chugging could be going to a good cause. It could feed an Indian family for a week.Yes, this movie has also risen my awareness of poverty around the world, despite the fact that I have taken Indian History.

594,prima-angkasa,great movie from Danny Boyle,10,11 January 2009,"This comment may contain spoilers i love this movie. very original and romantic. The way its told very good. Danny Boyle is one of my favorite director. The movie describe India very well. The road, the culture, the people, the way of life. All are very natural. Slum in India is not quite different in the other Asian country. And what makes this movie best. The color the setting the cinematography and the honesty of the main character, Jamal Malik. Why would Jamal Malik so desperately joins this show, called ""want to be a millionaire"" the answer is about to find at the end of the movie. The music is very good too. AR Rahman did the great job on this movie. I hope this movie will win the best picture at the academy award this year",Slumdog Millionaire
595,efrain911,"For love's sake, life is worth it",9,14 November 2008,"Even as we watch the bleak, matter-of-fact portrayal of the existence of people who live among garbage heaps, there is a delightful humor and hopeful strength throughout Danny Boyle's new film, SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE. It's an inspiring, brilliant, funny and epic underdog story set against the slums of Mumbai, India, (the city formerly known as Bombay), and a reminder that true love is worth life's trials, and indeed, worth the wait.The movie begins with an intense, interrogation scene where a young man, Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) is being viciously questioned by local police because of his recent appearance on India's hugely popular TV show, ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"" The law enforcement isn't convinced that this lowly 'slumdog' could know so much and be on the verge of winning 20 million rupees.So when the police review the game show tape with Jamal, each game show question brings up a specific memory in Jamal's life, and the seemingly predestined circumstance in which he learned the answer to each question. He simply tells his stories of the a poverty-stricken life in the slums, where he and his older brother, Salim, grew up, including their years on the road, train-hopping and hustling locals and tourists for survival after a tragic raid on their hometown. and the encounter with their ""third musketeer"", Latika (Freida Pinto)  Jamal's long-lost girl he'd never stopped loving.As his almost whimsical story unfolds, it becomes clear that the driving force in Jamal has always been the love for this lost girl. While Salim, the more entrepreneurial brother, had become hardened and driven mainly by money, it becomes clear as Jamal's almost-whimsical story unfolds, that the driving force in Jamal has always been his love for Latika.Even through the years of odd jobs and hobo-like travels, Jamal never stops thinking of this beautiful orphan girl. Until one day along the way, while working as a ""chai walla"" (the Indian equivalent to a ""coffee boy""), Jamal comes across Latika, now one of the girls belonging to an infamous gangster.I don't want to give away anymore details, but the movie is awesome. And as this tale unfolds, we see how Jamal ends up on the television show, so close to winning the biggest prize ever in its history. He inadvertently becomes the symbol of hope for over sixty million viewers, the inspiration for so many who are like him  from the slums with nothing but faith, hope and love to keep them going.He ends up being a hero in the eyes of millions of poverty-stricken people who watch the show because it's a reminder of the possible chance to escape the sadness around them. Which is partly why SLUMDOG is so wonderful  it is both escapist fantasy, reminding us the importance of dreaming while while never denying the reality around us.So yes, in a sense, Jamal is another Messiah figure  a hero willing to go through anything for love. And by doing so, he inspires millions of people who didn't have a voice  the lost and broken swallowed up in life's toils and snares; the forgotten ones and those who've given up hope.The subtle theme or running commentary of SLUMDOG also happens to be ""It is written"", referring to the predestination of life. The film gives us a 'big picture' view of life and the interconnectedness of all things. We realize that despite the ups and downs of Salim's and Jamal's lives, it all happens and comes together for a reason.Even the smallest incident involving sacrificial love from one of the most crooked characters in the movie shows us that their existence too is a part of the Big Picture  and even in death, they can provide life. Because of this hell and death that the characters experience, life can begin once again, and in many ways, start over. There is a beautiful scene where Jamal has a chance to kiss Latika, and figuratively kisses away her scars, a symbol of restoration and the beginning of a new life.SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE will definitely inspire audiences and put a smile on your face, possibly through tears of joy. The film's message is one of hope and triumph in the face of life's most difficult circumstances. It's my favorite movie of this year so far, and I hope that many others will enjoy it as much as I did. Hopefully SLUMDOG is a reminder that when we 'cross that river' and look back over all the hardships and trials, we'll be able to smile in the face of the Creator and say, ""because of Your Love, it was all worth it.""",Slumdog Millionaire
596,trigger_jam,Okay,6,2 January 2009,"Typical movie about India that western audiences love so it isn't surprising it has all these great reviews and nominations. AR Rahman's score is good. The acting is decent enough. The whole notion of the actors speaking in English was difficult to get over. Especially when the ""slumdog"" busts out English in an English accent. What was the point of having a mix of Hindi and English dialog? Story is very similar to Hindi movies of the 90s like Parinda, Sadak etc. But of course the whole ""who wants to be a millionaire"" is a unique touch over the typical ""slum"" stories. There is nothing extraordinary about it but there is nothing all too dull about it either. It sits comfortably in the middle.",Slumdog Millionaire
597,Wonderkind,Fantastic Insight,9,17 January 2009,"I absolutely love this film. From the first minutes to the last seconds, it was breathtakingly beautiful and heartbreaking all at the same time. Danny Boyle manages to capture the hectic chaos, noise, dirt, colour, vibrancy, dark and light of a Mumbai slum alongside the scenic beauty of modern India. Jamal's story is shadowed by poverty and the grimy underbelly of gangsters and guns from a very early age yet positivity always comes out from the path of unspeakably terrible things and you are left uplifted just as our protagonist is. Throughout his life, his love for Latika, the slum girl we see huddled in a puddle, shivering in a thunderstorm, brings him through whatever happens to him, and drives him to seek her out and draw them back together. The Millionaire premise is what opens and closes the film, like a bookend, the film is open and shut with the same feelings and thoughts. Happiness and love can push you through any despair. In watching this, the day to day despair you feel is infinitely superseded by the misery that Jamal and his companions have to got through, yet it is their youthful outlook to never let anything get them upset, that makes them so amazing and reminds you that as a Western world, we are incredibly self-centred and over-concerned with what is trivial, greedy for more and more when people with nothing have the ability to live each day content with the small things. The young Jamal, Salim and Latika's acting is outstandingly believable and it feels like you are an outside observer dropping in on their lives, rather than viewing a script. I cannot recommend you this film enough. The soundtrack gives me goosebumps and the trailer brings tears to my eyes. If you enjoyed City of God, you will love Slumdog Millionaire. A secret venture into the lives of people that we don't hear about enough, and that are so much more real than any of the other Hollywood blockbusters around. Truly worthy of an Academy Award. My only regret is that I didn't audition for this...",Slumdog Millionaire

It seems obvious to me that Mr. Boyle, having missed every time with western audiences thought that he could cash in with the Bollywood crowd and score himself some Rupees for his overdue retirement party. To make such an unrealistic, manipulative film and simply label it a ""fairy tale"" is an insult to every well-written fairy tale ever penned and to use (and I emphasize the word ""use"") the residents of these slums in such a manner that undermines their abject poverty is boo worthy. Danny Boyle should be booed for having tried to manipulate so many people's emotions with such flaccid trash. Stop bandwagoning this miserable piece of sub-art, Slumdog apologists and cultivate yourself an objective opinion.

600,peterafro,A unique on an old story type,10,6 August 2016,"Slumdog Millionaire is, in a nutshell, I growing up story, something we seen in man other film (ex: Forrest Gump). Of course that is not a bad thing, as this film does twists to the formula. One is its use of the ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"" game show, will this may seem like shameless product placement at first, the film use the mechanics of the show to its advantage, even with the lifelines. Also the film does a good job of merging Jamal before, during, and after the show and fusing them all into one smooth story. Another interesting thing about this film is the clever directing, such as clever scene transitions (ex: filling the screen with smoke from a blower then having Jamal come out of smoke in the next scene). Another unique thing about the film is that the growing up part is what surprises you, rather then the current situation (not that you will completely predict that either). The only flaws I have are a few bizarre editing choices (ex: a viewing from an angle for a few seconds for no reason)",Slumdog Millionaire
601,Biofriend,An overrated movie....,6,11 January 2009,"Though the movie was commendable in portraying the real India, but the script was all too dreamy to cast any effect on the viewers. It was clearly evident that it is made by foreign guys who only knew one thing about India that it is poor and poor people abuse. Direction was good and so was the camera work. The kids who portrayed the younger version were so brilliant that you won't believe that they are kids. Though the main character was well chosen but I guess the casting people were too busy on the lead that they forgot to take interest on other characters.The script had too many loopholes but I guess the slum-boy turning to millionaire sympathy saved the movie. Overall it is a nice entertainment with some excellent music score by A.R. Rehman, but don't go expecting too much while watching the movie. Overall I will give only 6/10 to this movie with credits to the lead actor, direction, music and excellent camera work and the producers should blame the script writers and poor casting for loosing the magic figure of 10/10",Slumdog Millionaire
602,momentsoffilm,A feelgood film about the wealth of life and the riches of love,7,24 January 2009,"Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire is a wonderful feelgood film about the wealth of life experience and the riches of love. At times it feels very unrealistic but we happily suspend disbelief for the pleasure and joy of this fast paced ride.What struck me most is that, though bursting with all the colour and vitality that Mumbai has to offer, the film has a very British feel to it with a cool modern soundtrack, a mischievous outlook and a winning energetic spirit. (And of course plenty cups of chah!) Everything about the film exudes cheeky fun, the music, the title sequence, the colourful offset subtitles and finally the Zatoichi style Bollywood closing number.The cinematography is stunning. It's rich dense colours and the unique vantage points of the shots give an energetic upbeat feel to the footage. Expert cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle used a mixture of 35mm and hand-held digital (shot on the P+S Technik 2K). The digital was introduced as a way to include the fast paced movement through the narrow, densely populated slum streets without getting stuck in them with bulky Indian film cameras or attracting too much unwanted attention from bystanders. About 60% of the film ended up being shot on digital and a small amount was shot on a CanonCam stills camera on continuous burst.The beauty, energy and uplifting qualities of Slumdog enable the film to deal with more sinister elements of the story in an engaging way. Far from being harrowing the films violent points are given to us with hope for overcoming life's dangers, and these punches of the dark side of India are what keeps the film from being dismissed as pure fairytale. Beautifully acted by an endearing cast it is instead a fantastic triumph of meaning and relevance in a growing city that is set to become the largest in the world within the next decade or so.",Slumdog Millionaire

True love how it should probably be felt and shown if the world was perfect - a strong feeling for a person, who you love and don't give up on since your childhood.

I don't know, but seeing this movie just got me the feeling I was watching a soap-opera...and come on.. the questions/answers to the show were coming in the exact chronologically way that happened in Jamal's life - I hated this thing.It's a good movie for this year, but definitely not a great movie. It needs a lower rating!",Slumdog Millionaire
605,PimSollieFilm,"I wouldn't call it a 'feel good movie', but it's definitely great",8,27 March 2009,"(Very) Global: Slumdog millionaire is about a boy who grows up in different towns/cities in Inda, as a 'slumdog'. When he loses the love is his life, he's going to enter a television show called 'Who wants to be a millionaire?' (Dutch people might know it as 'Lotto Weekend Miljonairs'), in the hope she'll watch and come and meet him. In the beginning, no one thought the Slumdog would win ANY money, but because of his rich life experience and is horrible way of living, he knows almost every answer by himself. He ends up winning the jackpot; 20.000.000 rps.At first I didn't really know what to think about slumdog millionaire. I thought people only thought it was great BECAUSE it won eight Oscars, and not that it won eight Oscars BECAUSE it was great. But in the beginning of the movie I was immediately intrigued by the life Jamar and his family had to live trough. And I had the idea (especially in the beginning) that Jamar was the ONLY nice person in the whole movie. From is schoolteacher to the police, and from the police to the showhost, everyone treated him like crap. And the amazingly way of acting (extra compliments for the actors who played the little versions of the characters), made it even heavier, intenser, but more exciting and sweat to watch.Trough the whole movie the watcher is smacked in the face by terrible (and sadly realistic) stuff that's happening in the cities of India and it's slums. Corruption here, child prostitution there. But the movie amazingly balanced it all out by putting jokes in it that really made me laugh (and again; the little actors were a big factor in this matter).So my conclusion is; Besides the predictable and lame ending (and that's not even about the typical bollywood dance part), the movie was a great adventure that figuratively grabbed me from my seat and pulled me in to the screen. The acting, the writing and the AMAZINGLY direction gave you mixed feelings, but not at all in a negative way.9/10",Slumdog Millionaire

Beautiful performances by the actors especially by the kids playing the role of Jamal and Salim. The movie showed the real life of the slum dwellers, through a kid. A must watch movie especially for the acting from young Jamal and Salim to the elder ones. The direction is undoubtedly a master piece, showing the real slum and the people living in.The story show the life of a boy who faces difficult challenges thorough out; and a desire to get his love back.

607,Abhishek_R,The most over-rated movie of 2008,5,30 March 2009,"Over the past few months, I've been hearing a lot of praises for this movie. And the Oscar achievement added more to that. Congratulations to everyone associated with the movie. But I seriously feel its 'much ado about nothing'.I agree that the concept of the movie - the basic plot - is a fantastic one. But all said and done, the movie still doesn't work (at least for me it didn't). Its the screenplay that has been a let-down.I haven't read the actual book. But the movie-plot is full of holes. The major one is the language. I feel the makers were forced to use English as a medium of dialogue, obviously because this was a Hollywood movie. The so-called 'Slumdog' Mumbai kids talking in English is something I cannot digest. It was quite good at the beginning when the kids conversed in a dialect of Hindi which was very similar to the actual one used in slums of Mumbai (including the swear words). But then we find the teenage Jamal, Salim and Latika conversing in fluent English. That's simply unrealistic, especially after what they had gone through in their lives. The villain Mamman too switches over to English while talking to the teenage Jamal and Salim, while he was talking to them in Hindi a few years ago.The way in which the events in Jamal's life were connected to the answers to the questions, failed to impress. Most reeked of poor research. Almost all of them were unrealistic and unbelievable. Trust me, I can guarantee this, no boy from slums would call a revolver a 'Colt'. And how does a blind kid looking for alms know about Benjamin Franklin? The communal riots sequence could have been good connection, but how does a boy disguised like lord Rama turn up in an area of total chaos, and is just standing there absolutely relaxed.At the end, watching Dev Patel and Frieda Pinto dance in the railway station to the tune of Jai-Ho made me roll-over laughing. It was hilarious. The dance moves seems totally disconnected to the lyrics of the song. And Dev Patel's two left feet were not much help either. In fact, it would have been better if there was no dance at all. But hey, after all, its a Bollywood movie, and every western director who wishes to direct an Indian movie always wants to direct a song-and-dance sequence. But this one here has beat many Hindi movies in terms of the ridiculousness of a song.About the performances, the kids did an absolutely marvellous job. Anil Kapoor, Dev Patel and Frieda Pinto did a nice job too. Irfan Khan has been wasted in a forgettable role. AR Rehman rocks as usual, but Jai-ho is certainly not his best.Overall, I think this movie was a loose interpretation of the Mumbai slums, the people there and their lives. Its a confused movie, which just stops somewhere in middle of making a feel-good movie suited to the sensibilities of the western audience, and going for a total 'indianization' of a Hollywood movie. It should have rather sided one end.",Slumdog Millionaire
608,rr614961,The Best Film of The Decade.,10,17 March 2009,"Slumdog Millionaire is film at it's absolute perfection. I won't bore this comment with the story, but rather talk about the underlying genius that really brings out the beauty of this story. Jamal and Latika struggle throughout life to look to lead a regular life. They show how money is important, but not completely a necessity for some people. Love triumphs all and this film tries to perceive love as a basis of story and intrigue. Slumdog has a terrific soundtrack and the music accompanies the story as a constantly building theme of drama and desire. This film has an extraordinary style and it can be watched at anytime by anyone and understood because it is a reminder that the simple things in life are those that are most important.

Yes one such experience is ""slumdog millionaire"". From every point of view, acting, direction, cinematography, music to any little detail of the film you name it, has been worked on almost to perfection, to create refreshing tale of love, betrayal, crime and destiny. If you watch closely there are lots of things one can learn from watching the movie, to name a couple are, never give up hope in life and bitter but a fact no gains come without pains. It is amazing that a movie that almost came close to be released directly to a DVD wins 8 academy awards. I hope that it's just the beginning, because lots will now be expected from Danny Boyle. The director has just raised the level of expectations, for what ever he makes in the future. Well for right nowif you are still reading, you'd better go and experience the story of Jamal and other characters in the movie.

It honestly makes me question what love really is. I still may be a young man and may not find true love for many years but this film will clearly show you what true love really is. Even though this movie gives off the feeling of an emotional drama at the beginning, and even at times a legitimate biography, it still is very much one of the most romantic films that a person can witness. It is about a young Indian man, 18 years old, who lost the one and only true love of his life when he was young. This young boy has also lived most of his life as an orphan. He travels around the country of India in search of his one true love, Latika. On his journey he discovers past acquaintances, enemies and family. Jamal, the protagonist, is now a young man and is on the game show ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire."" Every moment of his painful, dramatic, profound and love-filled life leads to the answer of every question on the game show. The game show, however, is not about money or fame but, simply for love.Once you view this film you will not be disappointed for it involves so many aspects of life that can be related to (even if you cannot relate to the characters themselves).There are scenes in this film that will make you cry, applaud and even laugh but overall, this is a film to be watched and cherished for many years because it shows the true nature of love; it can be perceived when it is observed hard enough but it takes effort to hold onto it and retain it for the rest of your life.",Slumdog Millionaire

I love that movie, it blew me away, but then there was this hidden gem, that I didn't see till this year. Where to begin? There is so much to say about this film but I am at a loss for words. How do I describe the way it made me feel? It's a drama, a romance, an adventure with action, a story of survival and social injustice. It will tug at your heartstrings and stimulate your mind. Shocking images of poverty and violence will assault your senses, but a story of enduring love and perseverance will counter the scenes of sorrow and deprivation. Top notch directing and acting, excellent cinematography, and most of all great storytelling make this a cinematic experience not soon to be forgotten. Told in a series of flashbacks, we see the events that shaped the life of our protagonist and enabled him to answer the questions as they were presented to him. Good character development brings us close to the ones we feel for as well as the villains we loathe. This film is a masterpiece. A work of genius. To put it simply, it's awesome. Of course it will have it's detractors, and some viewers will undoubtedly find reasons not to like it. That will be their loss.

This makes poverty feel like a fun time to the middle class westerner. Wesley Morris of the Boston Globe aptly put it ""I feel like I'm escaping into something that many people can't escape out of."" The most telling scene of the movie in which Jamal cons a tourist reinforces British Danny Boyle's sense of superiority to American tourists and Indian slum dwellers. ""This is (the real India)"" Jamal says to them. ""Here's a bit of the real America"" the tourists say as they give Jamal a 100 dollar bill. Millionaire may be aiming for Dickensian social drama, but unlike Bleak House or Oliver Twist, it rings utterly false. Part of the problem is that Boyle knew very little about India until recently and decided he maybe wanted to educate himself.

If you have a strong stomach AND a strong heart, this may be one of your favorite movies of 2008. It is now, one of mine.It's Christmas time in the cinema. All the good movies are out or coming out. Oscar is waiting in the wings for his darlings to embrace him.I am embracing Slumdog Millionaire. I have yet to see some of the top shelf films but at this point, I'd give this movie every award.Almost any movie that is shot in India is inevitably filled with color. (Think Monsoon Wedding) In Slumdog, the palette is oranges, reds, yellows and golds waving like fabric against cardboard and tin huts in the ghetto. Miles and miles of them.Clothes washing, bathing and swimming in polluted water. Shoeless, brown- skinned children chasing each other at the dump over mounds and mounds of garbage.Squalor like most westerners have never seen close up. Or at all.Slumdog Millionaire is about, Jamal, one of the unlucky boys who grew up in the Mumbai ghetto. Ghetto being a word too small to capture the vastness of this place. Early in the movie we witness the set up of the boy's life. Abject poverty, mother loss, he and his sometimes devious brother, Salim, ( I mean seriously devious) against the world.Then we fast forward to the miraculous event in the boy's life where he becomes a winning contestant on India's ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"" show. But, how is it possible that this ""slumdog"" young man who serves tea for a living can know all the show's answers?Swept away by thugs following his first night of winning, ""authorities"" try to beat an explanation out of him. He must be cheating.Here's the most masterful part of the movie. Jamal, who has been through way too much for this torture session to have much of an effect on him, takes his interrogators through horrendous episodes in his life where he lived the answers to the questions on ""Millionaire.""Superimposed in these scenes is the recurrent attention to a particular girl, Latika, to whom Jamal, is devoted since early childhood. It is this love, maybe the only constant in his life ,that provides the motivation that got him to the TV set and likely gave him a reason to live at all.The story is painful. There are a lot of scenes where I was forced to look away. But, the beauty of it is equally impactful. Upon leaving the theatre I felt myself exhale for the first time in nearly two hours and was exhausted from holding all of the muscles in my body in a vice grip.The characters are beautiful as children and as adults. The contrasting choice of paths chosen by the brothers, stunning. There's some basic good and evil stuff. Love conquering all. But, never did I think the messages were trite.It's how they're told that I find so remarkable.I probably won't be able to watch Slumdog Millionaire twice but I strongly urge you to see it once.

So what did I do? After watching many bad movies, I saved this one for a time when I really wanted a winner. My trust is my fellow man at calling a good movie good is blown. Since when does a movie that is completely disjointed become Oscar material? My whole enthusiasm was gone when I saw the cops torturing the kid for winning the game show. What? That's right. The whole movie is built around a kid that wins the millions on a foreign version of ""who wants to be a millionaire."" Oh come on. The kid while acting the part is so unbelievable - as he wins more and more money.. shows ZERO emotion - no wonder they think he cheated! But the torturing done it for me. WAY over the top unbelievable. Then we get the most bizarre flash backs I've ever seen to try to ""explain"" why he knew the answers. The movie is a humiliation on the intelligence of mankind.

Sounds tacky. Well, it is, but in a good way. It is nice to see that someone who didn't have a very easy life so far will win in the end. That's not the newest idea ever brought to screen, but this film has an interesting narrative perspective using flashbacks, and you will find yourself sucked into Jamal's story faster then you can blink. I really liked this film. The plot may sound lame at first, but it holds a lot of surprises. The only thing that kept me from giving this movie 10 stars was the end, or more precisely that Jamal managed to guess the last answer correctly. He had gotten Latika back, so it wasn't really necessary that he got the money as well. So much luck is just a little to fantastic. But it isn't so unrealistic that it spoils the whole movie, and I was happy for Jamal, nevertheless. It might just have given the film a last twist if he hadn't won, and it still would've been a happy ending. Except for this,the movie was perfect: great atmosphere, music and story. A must see!!!",Slumdog Millionaire
618,e_nugo,One of the best I have even seen,9,9 February 2009,"Some movies try to bring a complicated story line and able to make it really interesting without reducing the quality of the story. Some try to bring a simple story line but with a clever production, they are able to produce a really interesting and enjoyable movie without need to make every thing complicated, and this movie is one of them.The story just plain simple, but the way they tell the story should be considered as an original and clever approach. The children performed a perfect performance, the supporting actors are superb, the camera, setting, and the script are well executed. I put 9 out of 10 because I thing they should think a better closing act (after the movie was over). It does not means that the song and the dance are bad, no-not at all .... just after so much dramatic moments in the movie and one interesting story, it just feel a bit strange to see the leading role dance and sing. I thing it would be much more better if they provide a snap shoot picture of the ""future"" or just a picture from the production. But again, it just a subjective opinion!All and all, it is one interesting movie, one of the best I have ever seen.",Slumdog Millionaire

However, later on in the film, sunk in the the cheesiness, pretentiousness and the banal ending which killed the whole thing.I understand this is a realistic take on a intrinsically cheesy way of storytelling, but nevertheless I felt it should have been a less phony outcome.The film itself stands as a praise for a state of mind which strands millions of miserable souls to those miserable slums...Hence the mega-idiotic and ultimately shallow poster.",Slumdog Millionaire
620,khun-marcus,"One of the best films of the year, if not the best",10,4 January 2009,"On paper, the film sounds like nothing extraordinary. A young man from India gets a chance of a lifetime to go from rags to riches by being a contestant on the Indian version of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire."" Throw in another plot strand, that of the same young man trying to reunite with his long lost love, and it sounds like a been there, done that type of story. Yet director Danny Boyle, in what is probably his best film, comes up with ingenious ways to tell this story in what surprisingly turns to be one of the most original films I've seen in a long time. Told with a hyperkinetic pace and punctuated by an outstanding soundtrack (with songs by M.I.A., one of the hottest singers of this generation), this film, detailing the struggles of two brothers growing up, one a street-smart hustler, the other, the hero of the story, more innocent and good-hearted, is never predictable, and is by turns funny, suspenseful, sad and inspiring  sometimes all in the same sequence. Boyle makes a point to show the side of India we hardly see in pictures  instead of a country of glossy palaces that is home to a more than a few billionaires and an industry which exports four-hour long hyperbolic Bollywood melodramas, we see (in superb shots) a struggling, overcrowded India full of hardship and despair, where slums stretch for miles and life is very cheap, if even worth anything at all. But in no way is this a depressing sob story nor is it a predictable fairytale trying to be this year's Oliver Twist; in fact, it's a hugely entertaining film that offers sharp, incisive social commentary on not just the impoverished of India, but of economic hardships and what people do to overcome such adversity no matter where they may be in the world. That is no easy task, and the fact that Boyle accomplishes it so entertainingly well makes it all the more remarkable. It sounds like it shouldn't work, but as one character notes on Jamal's life, it's bizarrely plausible. It's also one of the most audacious, daring and best films of the year. Stay for the end credits.(Side note: This film, in one harrowing sequence, confirmed for me what my good friend from Singapore told me: That you should be very cautious when giving money to beggars, particularly those in Asian countries, as they are more than likely controlled by the mafia. Especially if they are blind or look maimed in some way  the more pathetic they look, the more they are able to elicit sympathy money from unsuspecting tourists.)",Slumdog Millionaire
621,karlosfandango,Highly recommended.,9,16 December 2008,"I didn't have high expectations about this movie even though it was directed by Danny Boyle. I saw a screening at my local cinema, and to be honest most screenings I have seen there have been a waste of time. I watched the trailer before going but was still not sure what to expect. Well, I can report that this movie was everything you want from a film and more. The storyline was different from any other movie I have seen and it was cleverly pieced together in flashbacks that are all relevant to the main theme. All the characters were believable and likable(especially the two main characters) or dislike-able as they were meant to be and the ending was neither twisty nor a foregone conclusion. It also showed India as it really is(I have been there) which for some I think will be shocking. In fact everybody in the cinema stayed until the credits had finished and unusually people were not speaking when they left? I would describe it as a Guy Ritchie-Bollywood movie! All in all this movie was a roller-coaster ride of emotions and I defy anybody not to be moved, or not enjoy it.",Slumdog Millionaire
622,dwm51,Biggest Product Placement since Cast Away,5,7 January 2009,"Remember Cast Away, with the product placement for FedEx which so swamped the film as to make it seem ludicrous? Well, this film comes close to matching it with its ""hommage"" to Who Wants to be a Millionaire? In the novel upon which the film is based, the spine of the story is provided by the struggle between the boy from the slums who threatens to win the big prize on a local TV quiz show and the presenter of the show and its producers who cannot afford to pay out the top prize and so set the police upon the boy to extract a confession of cheating. In the film, the presenter denounces the boy to the police although his motive is not clear. It is certainly not because the producers cannot afford the prize. On the contrary, the brand image of ""Millionaire"" as a show that loves its contestants to win is strongly reinforced. The production team is shown applauding his success and ""Millionaire"" is shown in a very positive light as being the focus of all India's leisure interest. Shouldn't we be a bit uneasy about otherwise decent films succumbing to product placement on this scale?",Slumdog Millionaire

624,socact-1,How Expectations Affect a Film,8,24 December 2008,"I went to see Slumdog Millionaire based on the words of countless critics, Top Ten Lists, and awards season rumors. Hailed as one of the best films of the year by virtually every news source in the U.S., I had to see what all the fuss was about. So I took my dad (a guy fairly opposed to subtitles and films with a budget under $100 million), and we saw this film the day before Christmas, when Hollywood releases its arsenal of heavy-hitting Oscar contenders.For me so far, 2008 seems to be the year of films not living up to expectations. Unfortunately, Slumdog Millionaire seemed to fit into this category, although this is not to say the film is a bad one. It has a compelling storyline, fantastic actors (young and old), adequate suspense, and compelling visuals. To elaborate, the story revolved around one boy's experience on India's version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, whose success stems from a lifetime of struggle, betrayal, poverty, and death. The film follows Jamal, the contestant, in snapshots of his young life in Mumbai, from his childhood in the slums to his seat in the Millionaire studio. It is a riveting sequence of events, which both define and challenge Jamal as he grows from a young boy to a young man.At the center of the story is Jamal's relationship with his brother Salim and friend, Latika. He pursues her throughout the film, as she is lost and found, again and again. These three characters form the emotional center of the movie that culminates in the final scene, and for me at least, their chemistry held the story together. All of the actors playing Jamal, from age 5 through 18, depict a spirited, intelligent little boy whose innocence ebbs as the game show, and his childhood, progresses. It is a tragic, but powerful transformation.Danny Boyle strings the scenes together with emotion, sensuality, and an innovative soundtrack. He really drew me in to the setting, a difficult feat when trying to bridge American prosperity with Indian poverty (and I especially enjoyed the dig on American tourists). But this film could not have taken place anywhere else, which was especially poignant in the scenes of Mumbai's citizen's watching Jamal on television.Overall, Slumdog Millionaire was a solid film that offers a refreshing storyline, compelling young actors, and capable direction by Boyle. But I can't see it as an Oscar contender, perhaps for its lack of anything truly exceptional. In a year, though, of superhero franchises, tired sequels, and over-budget epics, I will gladly take a little film like this one that captivates the masses, as Jamal did, with its humility and simplicity.",Slumdog Millionaire
625,benjamingsanfr,Nothing Special,7,11 June 2017,"I went into this movie not believing I was going to like it, however, it was not all that bad. In my opinion, it's not a classic or anything, it tells a somewhat corny, but uplifting and believable story. There's not much else to it, does not have any stand out scenes except for maybe 1 or 2. Overall, it is an entertaining film, but I do not see why this film got so much reward and recognition in 2008.",Slumdog Millionaire
626,katusnica,Kitsch,5,30 December 2009,"""Kitsch (English pronunciation: /ˈkɪtʃ/, as in German) is a German word denoting art that is considered an inferior, tasteless copy of an extant style of art or a worthless imitation of art of recognized value. The concept is associated with the deliberate use of elements that may be thought of as cultural icons while making cheap mass-produced objects that are unoriginal. Kitsch also refers to the types of art that are aesthetically deficient (whether or not being sentimental, glamorous, theatrical, or creative) and that make creative gestures which merely imitate the superficial appearances of art through repeated conventions and formulae. Excessive sentimentality often is associated with the term. The term is considered derogatory, denoting works executed to pander to popular demand alone and purely for commercial purposes rather than works created as self-expression by an artist. The term is generally reserved for unsubstantial and gaudy works that are calculated to have popular appeal and are considered pretentious and shallow rather than genuine artistic efforts.""",Slumdog Millionaire

But after watching for 20 minutes, all I felt like was turning it off. Shouldn't have even wasted that much time after they started out by torturing the star in the first 10 minutes of the movie. But since it was so well reviewed, I stuck it out for a little while longer. After seeing horrid poverty in the slums, a boy jump into a latrine, followed soon thereafter with people getting severely assaulted (or worse?) in a riot, I had enough. Good thing I did, I read the Wikipedia article about the movie and saw that the violence and cruelty got even worse.

The characters are all caricatures, the lead character ( Dev Patel) emotes like a British Asian, not like a real Indian.The actress playing Latika despite being an Indian, is unindian in presence.Actors speaking in English reminds us constantly that this is not India and these guys are not real Indians.The hero's brother is the only character who rise above caricature status.But despite my negative impression, I enjoyed the film, just like I enjoy a well made masala bollywood film.

630,thauseefbhai,A grim fairy tale with bursts of originality and beautiful visuals.,8,28 November 2008,"A director like Danny Boyle, who gave us the sickeningly tragic comedy ""Trainspotting"" and the more insane ""A life less ordinary"" (which for some equally insane reason, I loved), and of course, ""The Beach"", takes up a subject closer to my home country; Without doubt, I am intrigued. Also, given Boyle's penchant for seeing humor in sadness and pain, I wonder even before I step into to watch the movie, if he will present a slightly harsher version of the (under?)developing country India is.Surprisingly, Danny Boyle has done a great job of putting together the glimpses of life in the slums, an element that the richer Indian has almost developed an invisible eye to. We know these issues exist, but it takes a movie like Salaam Bombay or in this case, Slum dog Millionaire for us to realize that this is exactly what the city holds in its slums, despite all the fame and glamor of Bollywood and the moonlighted houses at Harbour Road.The movie is technically strong, visually appealing and bristles with the sort of innocence that only young artists seem to bring out so finely. The background score by A.R. Rahman, is simply fantastic and coordinates so beautifully with all the chase sequences in the movie (there are plenty). Parts of the movie, with their rich color and the harsh truths behind them appealed to me as brilliantly unique and brashly artistic. The cinematography and editing blossomed with originality. The script however, was anything but unique. I tried to give it the benefit of doubt and think of it as a sort of crude fairytale version of live, but the harsh realism was too much in contrast with some of the prolonged displays of love, which neither Dev Patel or ""girl with non Indian name and a shot to fame with no real good acting skills"", seemed comfortable or good at. I felt that while the younger artists performed brilliantly in the movie, the older actors for the most part, came out looking unbelievable. Here was the host of the show, who talks and mocks about a Chai waala, something they would NEVER do (and never did) in the original show. Some of his jabs are plain ridiculous and its unbelievable that the sets had an audience that seemed to enjoy it.Dev Patel, as the innocent (confused? nervous? what was he trying to portray?) kid on the seat, was confusing in his expressions. One of my friends asked me during the movie, if he was blind. That was a genuine question, considering how Dev Patel looked a little blurry eyed in many scenes. Same with Mahesh Manjrekar as Latika's husband? His performance was a little over the top. And yet despite these little faults, the movie does stick on to its promise of wrapping up with a fairytale ending. It gives you one last surprise though, and when it finally ends, you are not really unhappy. And it follows up with a Bollywood type number as the credits role, and thats the sweet chutney in your spicy Pani puri. No reservations whatsoever. The Pani puri has worked its magic.",Slumdog Millionaire

Look at any of the reviews on here that are enthusiastic, yes, it is all true. I have to add though that the editing is absolutely superb, I hope to see awards for that too. Danny Boyle has spoke of the fact that lack of English skills with the youngsters forced them to use Hindi with subtitles. I agree with Danny that this in fact improves the movie no end, but not only that the way the English subtitles are positioned next to the person who spoke them on the screen means that no momentum is lost, the subtitles come across as an enhancement which does not spoil the movie in any way.

It started out very slow and continued slow and did not become entertaining until halfway or more through the movie--worth seeing, but certainly nothing much above average. I suspect people liked it because it was not the typical Hollywood movie. I did not like the way it continued to flashback from the present to the past but I typically do not like movies that use this tactic excessively as this movie did. It was predictable in that the main character panned for a girl through the entire movie and circumstances always kept the two apart and only at the end of the movie did they finally get together. I thought it could have been edited better so that it did not drag so much in the first half of the movie. Certainly it is worth it to see if nothing more than it is very different than the typical Hollywood movie--no big name actors and while it is done in English, all of the actors are or appear to be native to India.",Slumdog Millionaire

Having been bitterly disappointed by my last two film outings at the cinema..i won't mention their names as they are not worthy of it..i'll just say that one of them was about a guy in a silly bat suit with a silly voice and the other was about a guy who works for the British Secret Service. Both of these films were total rubbish, boring and a total waste of my time and money and sitting through them had dulled my enthusiasm big-time for seeing anything else on the big screen.

Slumdogs director - Danny Boyle and his team of film makers deserve every award they receive.It was so refreshing to watch a film where it was all up there on the big screen, a film where you absolutely get your money's worth, a film after which when you walk from the theatre you have this wonderful, satisfying feeling flowing through you. All credit to the excellent cast, they are all truly great actors some of which were only as young as seven years old.

The film's storytelling is so compelling that I could not help but catch my breath. I feel that the treatment of using a game show to narrate the simple rags to riches love story is very intelligently done and executed.

I am a person who enjoys all the great works of literature, who thinks deeply over the many joys and sorrows of life, and who sheds tears in almost all situations because, although I am sensible, I am also emotional and find no fault in expressing what I feel. When watching this film, everything depends on how you think of life and what you believe is of greatest value. To explain what I mean, allow me to give you an example: my father is a computer engineer and his reaction to this film was, ""I don't think he would have continued playing the game once he reached 10 million if he wasn't certain of the answer."" To those who value material things more than the love and devotion of one person for another, even if they do not fully realize it or do not wish to admit it to themselves, this kind of a reaction is bound to spring up. However, those who are entirely cognizant, completely aware of the significance of love will reply, ""He did it because he loved her."" And yet, the cynics will not understand. This film is a roller coaster without a single pause. Not one second of it bores you, not one second will you be able to say, ""I know what's gonna happen now."" Certain emotions ascend, only to be overcome by different and even stronger emotions; this cycle goes on from beginning to end and as credits begin rolling, you will either label this film as pessimistic, or as fantastically optimistic.For those with personality traits similar to mine, for those with a mind of feeling and sentiment stronger than anything else, for those who have the ability to search for the meaning of things, no matter how bizarre the exterior, this film will be remembered for a very long time as the most beautifully written, breathtakingly optimistic masterpiece of the past years.",Slumdog Millionaire

This really could be a true story. I bet that the biggest part, of course, not the winning 20 billion rupees, but the life of homeless kids is true. I guess that this film could be shown by UN or some organization like it to show the rich people who they can help. Well, that's what I would do if I had money.I heard that India's government didn't like this film. And there's no surprise  what a poor and corrupted country India is shown in it. Well, maybe they should do something about it? So, the story is great, cinematography is good, talks the film recalled  loud. Actors. Not professional, but more true you could ever find. This was what those kids are living. Some chance for them. Good.The ending... Some of my friends and my lecturer said that it would be more great if a train would have hit Jamel or Latika. But I think that that Bollywood style ending was great. Well, it's still India, still the happy ending A thing people in India are going to watch  it's very hard for a film without a little part of Bollywood in it.Conclusion. I haven't seen other nominated films, but I don't think any of them could have won when a film like this  with a story, directing, filming and acting like this  was competing. Not the best film ever, but probably the best the Academy had seen.",Slumdog Millionaire
647,jalka,A testament to the indomitable human spirit,9,11 December 2008,I had heard about this movie from watching a preview off of one of my my recent rentals..sadly that title is slipping from my memory. I was fortunate however to attend a free preview of Slumdog last night.I will say that the movie touched me in ways other movies haven't. While watching the movie and Jamal's progression through life I kept thinking how many American's are still clueless to the struggles that go on in the rest of the world.Of course being that I'm a newlywed Jamal's love for Lakita and his perseverance throughout the movie is what touched me the most. It was amazing to realize that he would always look for her regardless of how my obstacles were put in his way.Technically I found the film wonderful as well. There were a couple of wonderful transitions visually. The music was spot on and fit the film as well. As for the dance number at the end I thought it was a nice touch and upbeat considering everything that Jamal had gone through to get to his final destination.I would recommend this film to anyone that has ever been in love or that would like to be reminding of what true love can be.Enjoy!,Slumdog Millionaire
648,sit_UBU_sit,A brilliant piece of film-making by Danny Boyle,9,18 January 2009,"An orphaned 18-year old Indian teen named Jamal is within one question of winning the grand prize on the Hindi version of ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire."" When the show breaks for the night, he is arrested and questioned by local police, who can't believe a ""slumdog"" would have such vast knowledge. I really don't want to give too much of the plot away, but this is a brilliant film. The way the story is told is quite unique, especially the stories behind how Jamal knows the answers to some of the questions. Find a theatre that is playing this film and go see it. Hopefully in over a month, it will be announced as ""Best Picture"" at the Academy Awards and it will be well deserving.",Slumdog Millionaire

I watched 'slumdog millionaire'.. 'after' the media advertising saturation it got left me no option(as an avid film fan) but to go and watch it. Im glad I did, but it left me with a feelin of 'did I miss something whilst watching?.. because absolutely no way did it live up to the hype. This has got to be one of the most hyped movies ever! definitely watch it.. but I bet you feel the same as me after.. my point is..

650,udayp_00,A taste of bollywood...,7,27 December 2008,"The first thing I want to mention is that I'm an Indian, an average Indian moviegoer. I never felt the need to mention this in any of my previous reviews. But, this is very important here as the opinion about the movie seems to change drastically depending on your perspective. I have been reading raving reviews about the movie from all over the world and the movie itself is bagging several acclaimed international awards. But for me, it is a ""typical Bollywood movie"". No doubt it is a good movie, excelling both in the acting and technical departments, but typical bollywood. This is exactly the language used by an average bollywood filmmaker. A boy meets girl, falls in love, gets separated, in between some bad guys, drama added and finally they reunite. This is Slumdog Millionaire. As an Indian, I'm very happy that this movie won so many plaudits. That means people all over the world are understanding the language of bollywood. But at the same time it makes me sad that many Indian movies that are many many notches above slumdog not even got close to the recognition this movie got. May be because the dialog is in English. It was annoying for me to listen Mumbai dwellers talking in English. But I think non-Indian audience will not feel a thing or may even feel more connected to the characters in English, in the same way as me preferring a French or German movie with English dialog than in native language. Or may be because the story was told by a British director. The language is bollywood but the accent British. Whatever may be the reason, slumdog's success is good news to Indian cinema. But, if you keep the Indian aspect aside, as a movie, I don't see slomdog as anything superlative. It is ""a simple love story told in the language of bollywood with English dialog"". Good job by Danny Boyle to cut the crap and retain the essence of bollywood story telling. Music and background score by Rahman is fabulous. Performances by Dev Patel, Madhur Mittal, Freida Pinto and the whole cast are well up to the mark. Special mention of childhood Jamal and Salim is necessary as they excel. And cinematography by Dod Mantle captures the essence of Mumbai slums which is the canvas on which the whole movie is painted. But all said and done, the movie dose not have the soul to take it to the next level. It is an average film which is well executed. For showing the world a new language of story telling, Slumdog may be a nomination worthy movie but not win worthy. Again, this is the perspective of an average Indian movie goer who has seen much complex and compelling stories told in the same language. So, for the viewers around the world, enjoy a taste of bollywood but remember we have much more delicious flavors. Indian viewers, have a glimpse of a bollywood film from a foreign director. All in all, Slumdog surely is a worthy watch for everyone.",Slumdog Millionaire

652,bongee,The best Bolly Wood film. Not that its worth talking about.,6,22 October 2009,"Case and point. Bolly wood is twenty to thirty years behind Hollywood. It basically copies 80s movies/TV and poor rap/tecno. Quite frankly it sucks. So, SlumDog... Great, or another Bollywood blunder. Well this movie is done well for its back grounds. It seems to mix Forest Gump with a game show. There are small differences, but not much from a far. Except this movie has huge plot holes that everyone seems to forget. Even the professional critics. This movie is a good movie, but not a great one.The movie starts with a young Indian man being accused of cheating on Who wants to be a millionaire. So they go through how he knows the answers. This is not a spoiler, thats the movie. See my disappointment. But I was told the directing was what made it. Hmmmm. I didn't see that. Terantino in Pulp Fiction was what made it. But this is well directed. I don't care what awards it own. Titanic won before, and other big budget movies won that don't deserve a thing. So those who oppose me here, look at this. Each question was asked in chronological order to when he knew the answer. No matter what your interpretation is, thats crap. How, how does that happen? Further more his brother would help him, after all that happens. And the way it happens reminds me of a stupid 70s action movie. Not even fitting with the character. The ending seems like it couldn't happen and is unexplainable. I mean if you won would you be in a train terminal? You can't excuse these problems, and there is more. What left is the struggle of a Slumdog. I think thats why Americans like it. They can't believe that there is a place like that. So thank the directors India for making you look like a third word country who dosn't care for your people. Its ashame, because the film makers don't try to use it for this effect. They obviously wanted a more dramatic appeal. Like Hollywoods Boy N the Hood, or gangster movies. So instead of the problem at hand, the actors, producers, and directors capitalize on the very people they are portraying. This movie seems like a good movie, but when up against debate brittle. But, in reality it should be a ashamed of it self. Oh and like all Bollywood crap this movie features crappy dancing at the end. Why is there dancing in a drama like this? Could you imagine at the end of Shawshank, Freeman and Robins dancing? I think it would lose points. Under first impression you could be thinking this a decent movie, but give a chance and the crappy direction and righting gleams through.",Slumdog Millionaire
653,ChiscoValdes,Dream high,8,19 June 2019,"The structure of the three acts in this film is broken because the development of the story does not go in a chronological order.
History suggests that dramatic time happens while Jamal is in the television contest Who wants to be a millionaire? answering a series of questions that leads him to be a celebrity because nobody had reached a streak like the one he was wearing. The reality is that the story happens while Jamal is being interrogated by the police, to find out if he was a scammer, while he begins to tell the cops how he knew the answers to the questions, the film puts us in his mind , using the flashback resource to access the information he saw while responding. This resource begins to build the character from back to front. It also makes us automatically be on the side of the character and take as a statement everything we see on the screen, because we are in their memories. Knowing his personal history as well as knowing how the uneducated could answer the answers to the questions of the show.
The story challenges the structure of the three acts because it is told almost from the end, when Jamal is about to win the top prize of television, and is using the future to tell us how it was that the character came to this in that situation.",Slumdog Millionaire

655,Paul-spooky,Poverty-porn sells good,1,20 January 2009,"Its not surprising to win awards by selling poverty from developing nations, rather it is a cheap trick. This has been done from various others such as Satyajit Roy, Mrinal Sen from India and now Danny from Britain. I am not saying they were/are not good directors, but only when they make films on poverty their piece of art gets an award.An award is much dependent upon the jury members and their background. If the jury members were from developing nations it may not have been even noticed.It is perhaps not incorrect to say that some countries are poor because some others are rich. Giving awards for depicting so called reality would not serve any good to the real cause. It will only make someone richer by selling the poverty of someone else.""The whole build-up of hype around the movie reminds one of the new-found appreciation of Miss World and Miss Universe organisers towards Indian beauty after India's economy was liberalized to allow international cosmetic giants to sell their wares in India,""",Slumdog Millionaire
656,slseel,Must-See,8,1 September 2008,"This is an extraordinary film. From the original concept of the novel on which it is based (Q&A by Vikas Swarup), the screenplay by Simon Beaufoy (Full Monty) but especially the masterful creation and direction of the film by Danny Boyle. From the opening moments until the final scene, the audience was fully engaged. I was completely lost in the world that Danny Boyle created. This is not a story that has been told and retold, hashed and rehashed. It is fresh and engaging - all at once quickly moving, romantic, violent, culturally insightful, desperate and slightly fantastic. There are some comic elements to the film but to describe it as a ""comedy"" seems inappropriate. The film was shot on location in India, mostly in Mumbai. Slumdog Millionaire is yet another testament to depth and range of Boyle's artistic talent who has directed such diverse films as Shallow Grave, Trainspotting, 28 Days Later and Sunshine.I saw the film on at the 2008 Telluride Film Festival as a ""sneak preview."" The film was introduced by Boyle who said that the official opening of the film would be the next weekend at the Toronto Film Festival. He also said that there may be some final tweaking of the film prior to Toronto.In the discussion after the film Boyle strongly recommended three Indian made films: Satya, Company and Black Friday. He described each as superb. Boyle also stated that a portion of the Slumdog Millionaire was shot with a Canon EOS still camera, especially around the Taj Mahal, rather than a proper movie camera which creates unwanted attention while filming at popular tourist locations in India.8.2",Slumdog Millionaire
657,pheluda,Much Ado....,6,18 February 2009,"Much has been made of the rather lukewarm reception here in India to Slumdog Millionaire, America's most favorite tale of hope (after Obama) currently. A large section of the West seems to think that this might be the result of a relatively more upbeat Indian population (given the current financial scenario, upbeat can only be a relative term) that does not want to acknowledge the harsh truths behind its own success story. While this may be true for a section of the Indian Diaspora well and truly disconnected with the reality of life down here, it is certainly very far away from the reason why most Indians (and Mumbaikars in particular) can't seem to understand what the fuss is all about.Well, there's nothing to it really. Very simply, it hasn't touched Indian audiences to that degree because we're quite accustomed to watching 'uplifting' and inarguably illogical tales (a slumboy from Mumbai who speaks in chaste English with a Brit accent?) that Bollywood keeps churning out as it endeavors towards its mindless target of producing 200-300 mindless movies every year. While Slumdog may have enough in it to instill 'hope' in Americans, for a people that has to tackle corruption, abysmal governance, politics of hatred, and unbridled competition with a billion of its own kind on a daily basis - not to mention a terrorist attack thrown into this cesspool every month or so - Slumdog can't make the grade for 'uplifting' entertainment.The West often accuses Indians of ignoring or brushing under the carpet the sordid stories of every large and overstuffed metropolitan city in India, with Mumbai being their favorite bashing ground. Well, they're right  we do ignore, because we don't have the luxury to be tourists in our own country, and earning one's daily bread and butter in such a fiercely competitive arena makes us oblivious to any other living thing that walks the earth, except for our near and dear ones. And can you blame us? Does Joshua Bell performing in a Washington subway ring a bell? It's not so different here, just magnified ten times over One interesting point to note is that while Slumdog Millionaire has been nominated for as many as 10 Oscars, Taare Zameen Par, a sensitive 'Bollywood' film dealing with a middle-class, dyslexic child's struggle to cope with this competition, and widely toasted as the best mainstream offering from the Hindi film Industry in a long while, didn't even receive a nomination in the Best Foreign Language Film Category at the Academy Awards this year. Is it just me here, or is there a certain prejudice towards only one particular 'reality' of India, and ignorance towards other equally harsh realities, simply because the protagonists in them have a brick and mortar house to live in, instead of a shack? Let me clarify here that while it may seem so, I've nothing against the film  I found it to be entertaining and quite worth the watch. Neither do I have anything against the subject or the depiction of life in Mumbai  in fact, I would have found it more memorable had it given some more screen time to the dark undercurrents of the Mumbai underbelly, which were easily the most believable and fascinating parts of the film, greatly assisted by a rousing score from A. R. Rehman. My only grouse is with the perception that the Indians have some kind of a sinister agenda to not allow this film to succeed, because we don't  as the film highlights rather well at the end of the day, it's just a way of life out here, so why the hype?",Slumdog Millionaire

I guess I don't have much to say about this movie because IMDb.com keeps making me add more lines. I suppose if that is the case the movie might not be as good as I think?

663,ambush_xx,"Over the top, unrealistic and unneeded",6,26 January 2009,"I think this movies is doing well just because of the shock value; the revelation of violence/poverty in India to the western world. Now, i would have overlooked this fact(in fact i did, for movies such as city of joy) if the plot of the movie hadn't been so unrealistic and bland.Seeing this movie reminded me of another movie The Color Purple. There is lot of talk in the forum about the movie portraying all African American men as sexists, abusive and mean(not surprisingly most of it comes form African Americans). SM portrays a similar picture of India only way worse. Now, I like hardcore realism as much as anyone and an not denying these things happening in India.The plot of the movie is universal and could have worked in any country or culture. Imagine this movie is directed by a french or Canadian guy and is set in America and the protagonist is an African American woman. Her parents get killed in a race riot in Alabama. She hitches a ride and ends up in the streets of new york where she works as a hooker being beat up by pimps and cops( And all this has to be shown repeatedly in the most gory fashion) She then goes on to the TV show to find her long lost boyfriend. This may very well have worked but It wont be as exotic or have won as many Oscar nominations as seeing it happen to an Indian, Chineese or Thai.Like i said earlier i would have overlooked the Gross ""exploitation of poverty"" if it scored well on other aspect. Now, the plot is very interesting and i was really looking forward to seeing it. But the scenes and the stories behind each of the answers(which should have been the charm of the movie) are exceedingly unrealistic. I cant suspend disbelief and imagine that a blind beggar child in Bombay would know Benjamin Franklin is on a $100 bill, or Salim would know that he was holding a colt revolver, or Jamal would be able to pick up good enough English to pass as a tour guide.Overall i found this movie to be a disappointment except for the music.",Slumdog Millionaire
664,acehle,Slumdog is a magical yet harsh journey through India life and culture,8,3 December 2008,"""Slumdog Millionaire"" is beautifully written and amazingly captured by the dual directors. There were many incredible shots of past and current India, starting right out of the gate. Most of the film involved the incredible and scary journey of two brothers as they try to survive and make it in a cruel world. The tale was fully engrossing and captured our hearts. But there also were many gasping and look-away moments showing the harsh reality of the slums. I really enjoyed the score and cinematography, and appreciated the reality of the boys situation and the things that had to be done. The directors left in some biting comments on religious zealots, crime lords, and even economic progress. The tale of Jamal and his brother was told in between bits of a showing Jamal on ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"", and with the current Jamal being interrogated. The ""flashbacks"" were never forced and the audience always wanted more. In all, this was an amazing movie that I would pay to see again. There were great moments of love and hardship, humor and sadness, destitution and success, all wrapped up in a tale of a boy trying to be a hero and striving to win the girl of his dreams too.",Slumdog Millionaire

666,kevin-1750,"A great film, much better than everything else around",10,18 January 2009,"I should declare an interest from the start. I like British Cinema and most of what it offers. That said, Danny Boyle (who I loved from TRAINSPOTTING) wasn't in my good books after ""SUNSHINE"", which I consider to be one of the worst films of recent years.Maybe it's because I was expecting nothing much, expecting an upbeat comedy, a sort of ""East is East"" type film that I found this film so good, or maybe it was the stunning performances by ALL the main cast, especially the younger children.Some reviews have focused on the inconsistencies, especially towards the end of the film, but I felt this was mainly the Bollywood elements and it was nice to have such a strong Bollywood influence in a mainstream film. I'm not someone who likes happy endings, fluffy romance or feel good moments, but the many of these in this film were expertly balanced with the harsh, disturbing and sometimes look-away moments to turn the film into a masterclass of how to get a point across without needing to be too preachy.Many have also slated the image of India this film portrays. Having never been to India, it would be foolish of me to say what does or did go on there, however I feel that this movie explores some of the dark places that exist in every culture. The lack of good Indian people is true, however there are no people who come out of this film clean - it is a film about people, places, stories, realities and dreams. All these have flaws, and it's a relief to find characters who don't fit in a simple black and white, good or evil, category.At a time when almost every movie in the theatre weighs heavy with deep messages or wastes two hours with ""harmless"" mind-numbing ""fun"", it's a relief to find a film that could have you shouting with anger, crying with pain and laughing with joy all in the same short space of time.",Slumdog Millionaire
667,puneet-bhatia-in,Bollywood comes knocking,8,12 February 2009,"Disclaimer: I'm an Indian fed heavily on Indian films, and below is my experience from the perspective of an Indian. If something feels out of context or some Indian words fail to make sense, I'll be happy to discuss.It is the season of over-hype waves and things working by riding on them. An undeserving ""Ghajini"" becomes an all-time hit and now we have Danny Boyle's saga of amchi (our very own) Mumbai, ""Slumdog Millionaire"", sweep awards all across the globe. Though the narrative of a slum-dwelling chaiwalla (tea serving guy), Jamal Malik, holds your attention, haven't we all seen better? Boyle seems to have drawn his inspiration from Bollywood, which over the years has brought the poverty-stricken and dark reality of Bombay/Mumbai on the screen through the likes of a ""Salaam Bombay"" or a ""Satya"". The movie is a tell-tale of all that is wrong with India, only this time it is an outsider who brings to us the plight of slum dwellers, communal riots, the beggar mafia, the fleecing of foreign tourists, the prostitute business, the underworld, the abusive police alongside an eternal love and longing  all in Bollywood style! I don't understand the criticism that is being heaped on the movie about it depicting our country in a negative light. Boyle has presented what our filmmakers have been doing for decades. The film captures the darker shades of Mumbai but hasn't everyone from RGV to Madhur Bhandarkar done it before. I would honor the director's prerogative to not sugarcoat his subject, even if it means stringing in cliché after cliché.Some of us have gone ahead and challenged the film for projecting India as a ""Third World dirty underbelly developing nation"". In fact, I believe it is quite the opposite. Alongside all that is shown as wrong, there is an undercurrent of hope that flows throughout the film. The film manifests the much-talked about ""spirit of Mumbai"" through the resilience of the protagonist. The ability of the characters to survive against all odds, come what may, forms the fabric of the screenplay.The premise of how a slum dweller knows the answers to all the questions in quiz show ""Who wants to be a Millionaire?"" and goes on to win the show makes an interesting story. And it is in the answers that the story of Jamal's life unfolds. Even though the film is in no way extraordinary, what is surprising is how Boyle churns out a potboiler that has Bollywood written all over it. In our typical ""filmy"" fashion, Jamal goes about finding his childhood sweetheart and expressing his love for her. I can't believe a foreign director can see India this way! As an Indian, fed on a staple diet of Hindi cinema, this one barely seemed any different.That the western audience has accepted the film in a big way and that critics are lauding it with awards is more to the credit of the marketing team behind the film. The publicists deserve every bit of praise for being able to package the film in a way no India-themed movie (no not even ""Lagaan"", and I was too young to notice what stir ""Salaam Bombay"" or ""Gandhi"" created in their time) has ever been done before. I do hope it goes on to win the Academy Awards, at least for Rahman's work (even though in the same breath, I should add that the musical genius has far better works that have gone unnoticed).And at a time when (borrowing a dialogue from the film) ""India is at the center of the world"", this is good news for Indian cinema. Going by the response ""Slumdog Millionaire"" has received, ""the song and dance factory"", which Bollywood is commonly seen as by the world, can come up with crisper ideas and market them well to the world. Perhaps, a western audience is becoming willing to hear an Indian story, the Indian way!",Slumdog Millionaire

I loved it, and was shocked to see his name flash up at the end!Although the plot is somewhat convoluted with a bit of ambiguity in its chronology, the story is intriguing, and although I went when I was kind of focused on something else (namely a meal at my favourite Lygon Street cafe), I was engaged quickly, and the film held my attention until the end.There are some great performances from some child actors, and spectacular performances from the adult cast, but the star of this film is definitely the cinematography. From the slums of Mumbai to the Taj Mahal to the beauty of India's countryside, even the most dire of circumstances is presented beautifully, composed with a delicacy that is not common in films about this subject matter.There aren't many films that successfully depict the horrible realities of our world and retain a sense of possibility and optimism, but Slumdog Millionaire does this beautifully.

I can not fault anything about this movie, it is as close to perfect as a motion picture can get. All the cast are brilliant and draw you in to their story, and you don't want to miss anything. It shows India as a beautiful place that has a dark side, I couldn't tear my eyes from the screen, even during the dark moments I was mesmerised.The movie tells Jamal's story. Jamal is a young contestant on ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"". He does well, a little to well however, and is suspected of foul play. After brutal interrogation he explains how he came to know the answers; in doing so he tells the compelling story of his life up to that point. If I told anymore of the story I might take something away from the experience of watching this stunning and inspiring journey that Danny Boyle has brought to life with exquisite beauty and shattering excellence.A film has never made me feel the way that Slumdog Millionaire made me feel and I would urge anyone and everyone to see it. This is a truly magical journey...must see!!!!!!!",Slumdog Millionaire
670,ritabaasch,Very clever and entertaining,8,10 January 2009,"I'm just starting to review what I see. I generally like independent movies, primarily because I got tired of paying high prices at the movie theaters and then getting burned (because of the heavy amount the studios apparently spend on promoting a movie)I did however, see three movies just recently. One of them was Slumdog Millionaire.I really liked this movie. I thought the concept was clever and the direction was superb. I'm a little confused on who directed what, because IMDb has two directors listed. If that is so, then both Danny Boyle and Loveleen Tandan have done a marvelous job.All of the actors were believable and did a great job.The music and editing kept it going at a fast pace. And all of the visuals were an eye opener for meI do recommend.",Slumdog Millionaire
671,mmahadevan,Boyle showed what the liberal left of India have done to their country,7,3 March 2009,"The movie starts off very well, MIA/AV Rahman's O'Saya (MIA was robbed of an Oscar for this) kick starts the movie with the kids ....young Jamal in particular and the ride starts....Its an amazing beginning for this ride....Like a 747 taking off that requires maximum thrust at take off, the song ""O'Saya"" and its intensity was what gave the lifting thrust along with the cute kids running with equal intensity . I have never seen a movie that started with such a bang. However, it peters out soon and by the time the adult Jamal's is in the story, it becomes a cheesy film to tie the lose ends.The good thing I liked about this was the showcasing of the slums as it is for real. The slums and the extreme poverty in India is the work of the congress party (The liberal left). they have ruled India almost 85% of the time since independence and this is what they have to show for it. China seems to have done so much better. India's liberal lefties have failed India miserably. It's time to stop India's anarchy (disguised as liberty) and get a China like government in place to clean up the mess.Recently New Delhi Municipal did not allow new slums to be built in the city...and the left was out in full force demanding the right of poor migrants from rural areas to live wherever they want. India's left help build these slums. and then they have the audacity to point it out and tell the world...""hey look... these poor people are living in slums"" while they have controlled India for the most part(government).so at least we got to see that.There is also this interesting thread in this story. The relationship between Jamal and his ""evil"" brother Salim. This was fascinating. Salim was not an one dimensional character. Salim has let down his younger brother a few times...but where it mattered, Salim came through for his brother. Jamal knew it when he tried to explain to Latika that his brother would help them. He knew his brother.One more thing I did not care for, was the originally story (Q&A) had a pedophile Christian priest exploiting the kids. This was conveniently left out of the story and the ""Hindus"" killing the Muslims was introduced that was not in the original story. India is a country where you hear Islamic terrorism almost every month. This was PC at its worst.So all in all there were some very nice parts...particularly the kids. They were amazing. I guess, its worth at least one watch for the kids performance.There are couple of songs that you may want to download for your ipods.1. O'Saya (MIA and A V Rahman) 2. Paper Planes (MIA)",Slumdog Millionaire
672,pinolaricio,Exploitative and manipulative film,3,9 August 2009,"On reflection I thought the film was exploitative and manipulative. What is its message? That TV game shows can save even the poorest of the poor? And what of the choice of actors? While the film contained harrowing scenes of a poor dark child being blinded, the make-up men clearly shirked from portraying the leading actress with credible scars at the end of the film. As the film progresses the two leading characters get progressively paler until they become 'almost' white and hence - I imagine in the view of the director - more palatable to audiences. Which half of the film are we supposed to believe in: the dire life of the slum dwellers or the cosmetic H/Bollywood romantic ending? I think it uses the former to legitimize the latter: it exploits the real Mumbai protagonists of the film by involving them at first only to drop them out of the picture to make way for its 'attractive' Europeanized leading stars. Likewise it manipulates Western audiences into thinking that India's social problems are not so bad because in the end true love (and true money) can triumph thanks to a TV game show. Or is the film just an elaborate plug for the show itself? The film was clearly tailored for affluent Western or Westernised audiences. I believe its 'social' denunciations are simply a device to fool viewers into thinking that the film is worthwhile so that it can get its real message across: celebrity TV, money, some measure of astuteness and good Western looks are going to save the world (as well as guarantee box office profits).",Slumdog Millionaire
673,imdb-21100,A man from the slums of Mumbai competes in a game show,10,7 February 2009,"Slumdog Millionaire is a rags to riches saga, and it's also the oldest story in the world: Boy meets girl. Boy gets girl. Boy loses girl. Boy tries to get girl back... But yet, in so many ways, it takes what could be such a dusty old story and makes it new again. Even the premise of a game show on first blush seems like it will yield little if anything of interest, but even though I am not a fan of these silly game shows (except of course Jeopardy, which challenges the mind) I was enthralled by this movie.And on top of the compelling story, you also get a most fascinating backdrop: India, and the City of Mumbai, formerly known as Bombay. You get teeming slums filled with poor but resourceful people juxtaposed with the splendor of the Taj Mahal; you get an ancient culture making rapid fire changes to a modern one, transforming before your eyes. Slumdog Millionaire is quite an achievement, and one that seems to have come along at precisely the best time: Like the game show, it offers an escape in times of economic strife.The device of the game show is brilliant, as it allows the questions, and the subsequent interrogations, to each trigger a flashback, an episode in the past that will illuminate how Jamal Malik, the nominative Slumdog Millionaire, came to know the answer. Sure, there is some luck involved, but oftentimes a memorable event in Jamal's past will make the answers stick in his mind. As we discover how he knew the answers we also learn about how much he loves Latika, and how his brother Salim became a gangster. The performances of the three characters in that ""bazaar"" love triangle, as children, and then young adults, were brilliant. Kudos to Dev Patel, Madhur Mittal, and the lovely Freida Pinto. Anil Kapoor was brilliant as the show host, Prem Kumar--a younger, Indian version of Regis, but with an edge.Prem Kumar: So are you ready for the final question for 20 million rupees? Jamal Malik: No, but maybe it's written, no? Prem Kumar: Maybe...",Slumdog Millionaire
674,iampratikk,Seriously ?? 8 Oscars and 8.3 ???,1,21 July 2010,"I don't understand why people like this movie so much. It's a s*it of a movie; nothing in this movie is worth watching. I have not read the book but movie; it's just a waste of celluloid. This movie is a serious let down from Danny Boyle, the man directed awesome movie like Trainspotting and here he is with this cr*p. Pi$s poor acting, weird accents, unnatural scenes make the whole movie experience bumpy and somewhat like a torture. The movie looks as if it was created by some hormone flushed teenager with his pals in summer vacation. I get the attraction in the story; a bottom-feeder gets his chance to set the record straight, change to win a million, but there is no way in hell this could happen in real life. This kind of utterly impossible story pooled together with Indian background and Indian actors makes the movie pure torture. In a very cliché way, the only thing I liked was the end and even the end was not that good, they stood in rows, sang and danced in a typical Bollywood style. City of God and this movie? Seriously? There is no comparison! City of God triumphs this one on everything, City of God is down to earth, serious and gives more realistic feeling. It's original too; Slumdog however is exaggerated, it's out there, up in the air. City of God is a like a symphony, it's in perfect, in sync, real, organic; Slumdog – cacophony, out of sync, plastic, unreal. Finally words, the movie does not deserve all the fame and Oscar it got.",Slumdog Millionaire
675,G_Squared,Visually stunning.,10,3 December 2008,"Pros- ""Slumdog Millionaire"" was a fantastic film. The cinematography was incredible and resembles that of ""City of God"". The performances were great and will definitely put these budding actors on the map.I felt that the use of ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"" was extremely risky and daring, but done in a very unique and interesting way.Cons- I felt as though it had many cheesy tendencies. Im not criticizing anything but the writing. I definitely feel like it could have done without many lines such as ""You are my destiny,"" and so forth.As great and fun as the dancing at the end was, I feel like it did NOT fit at all. Unnecessary and somewhat of a cop-out for Boyle.",Slumdog Millionaire
676,lamaanhamid,"Too much hype, not enough matter.",6,24 January 2009,"The only reason I can think of due to which Slumdog Millionaire has won various awards is that the competition is seriously lacking. I enjoyed the movie, but not all of it.I must give full credit to the children who have performed in the movie, they are the ones who deserve a nomination/award. Bombay is shot beautifully, exposing the harsh reality of slum life. It is realistic and gripping. Then the children grow up, this for me was the turning point in the film. Patel, in the lead role was expressionless and irritating. I still cannot understand the Hindi (with subtitles) to English transition in the dialogue, and where for the love of god did the accents come from? (particularly those of Anil Kapoor & Freida Pinto, who hail from the Indian subcontinent).The entire story after the first half was unimpressive. There was no chemistry between the lead characters, probably due to lack of acting experience.I do not understand the ideology of the casting director for casting an NRI as the 'slumdog millionaire'. He does not suit the role at all. Irrfan Khan/Mahesh Manjrekar have not been used well. A R Rahman probably deserves every bit of the acclaim that he is receiving, but this movie is definitely not his best. For anyone planning to watch 'Slumdog', my advice is not to go with high expectations.",Slumdog Millionaire
677,johnmicheal_kane,slumdog millionaire is a winner.,9,5 February 2009,"A few months back when I heard that a movie called SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE made by Danny Boyle had taken the Toronto film festival by storm, i got curious to know more about it, mainly because of its peculiar name and also that movies successful at Toronto have been classics. Finally, when I saw the trailer, I was overwhelmed to see a movie on Mumbai after quite a while. Since then, I'd been waiting for the 23rd of Jan.Finally I saw it on the 23rd of Jan itself and I was falling short of adjectives to praise this outstanding once-in-a-lifetime masterpiece.It's a movie which got me emotionally engaged from start to finish. Though I feel that the movie could've been more dramatic by showing Salim and Javed's characters as more mean and bad, still I don't want to point out goofs in this movie, you don't find movies like this releasing every Friday. With an outstanding screenplay, excellent music, breakthrough performances by all actors and above all Danny's heart and soul put in the film, this is a movie to be recognized among movies made by Spielberg, Scorsese, Copolla and other such legends. 10 out of 10 from me !Also, I wish the team all the very best for the Oscars. I just wish that SLUMDOG wins all 10 of them!JAI HO!!!",Slumdog Millionaire
678,cb429,"Not deserving of the 34th greatest movie of all time, but still good",7,31 January 2009,"Amidst a lot of positive feedback and reviews, i decided to watch this film. Prior to watching the film i had seen the trailer and was not overly impressed. Not that much changed after i watched the movie. First things first, the acting by the children was spectacular. I heard that these kids were taken from slums and after the movie the directors gave them money for education which is highly commendable. The acting by patel and pinto is average as best but the story is good enough to overshadow this. The movie is exactly what they say it is. Nothing too much out of the ordinary. If an Indian or person from that area will watch this like myself, it will just seem that this a story of an individual person in Bombay. The reason that the movie has had such success is because many North Americans are not aware of the issues in India. The movie basically serves as an eye opener for them which is why the movie has had so much success. It's a good movie, undoubtedly not deserving in the 50 greatest movies of all time, but a good movie nevertheless. Watch it, but perhaps watch it with a little lower expectations that you may have been exposed to.",Slumdog Millionaire
679,vsivakum,Overrated,6,8 February 2009,"I think this movie has been overrated. Maybe it is appealing to the Western audience but for someone who is used to seeing the grandiosity of Indian movies, it is not clear why the movie has got such rave reviews.A.R. Rahman's soundtrack is good, though not clearly his best. I think the lyricist could have done better though (Personally, I think ""Jai Ho"" did not fit well with the song's tune, which I thought was pretty good overall).Anil Kapoor overacts his way to glory, and the movie could have done without him. Amitabh might have been better suited to the role - he was the original KBC host, after all.Having said that, the movie is watchable. But Oscar worthy? Well, I leave that for the committee to decide.",Slumdog Millionaire

Personally i thought the movie was really good but there was so much hype put behind it saying how great of a movie. After watching it just didn't seem to be anything that was spectacular. I enjoyed the performances but the story had a lot of flaws in which some moments just doesn't make any sense. But it being that all these actors are new and so is the directer it was a great first movie from them. When slumdog first came out it was completely underrated coming so close to going straight to DVD. It didn't gain any hype until all the critics started raving about it. After hearing how great it was this movie went from underrated into overrated. The movie is good though and I did enjoy seeing it but if you are planning to see this don't believe the hype it is a good movie but not nearly as good as you probably think its going to be.,Slumdog Millionaire

The story is full of plot holes which show poor workmanship for a film rated best picture. For instance, why is the final question so easy on the game show which is about a children story that is clearly taught to people of Mumbai and should not be a hard fact at all for these people? that does not make any sense. also another lame attempt at writing is ""Javed"" finding out ""Latika"" escaped when he hears it on TV in his own house when he is the crime boss that demanded not to watch that show?",Slumdog Millionaire
682,xleadinglifex,Average...in every way. Disappointing...in every way.,5,23 May 2009,"I put Slumdog into the DVD player and I was psyched! Everyone was raving about how great it was and I just couldn't wait. As I watched it I was looking for the good aspects of the film, that great aspect that made it as great as it was supposed to be. Was it there? If it was I didn't find it. I found predictable, average, and no redeeming qualities.The plot. Okay, I get it, it sucks to live in the slums. Can we skip that because I prefer not to spend hours looking at other's sucky lives. Was I supposed to be amazed they were kidnapped? Was I supposed to be shocked they spooned out their eyes so they'd make more money? I wasn't. I already knew all of that, and, quite honestly, they do that much younger and without all the voice training years. All that was was a plot stall to explain a few questions that no one would remember anyway.The acting. What's supposed to be hard to play there? These characters had so little depth to them that if you can show happiness and sadness and a blank face you get the part. They showed all three of those emotions really well, but...I thought there were more emotions than that.And then it was predictable. The couple ends up together. So wasn't expecting that. Despite the fact that they spent half their life not knowing each other in between childhood and ending up together they still love each other. How sweet.So why did this win the Oscars? Because it was 'Hindi.' It wasn't. White people made it to look like they're not racist. They're not and I don't think anyone thinks they are, so stop embarrassing yourselves.",Slumdog Millionaire

The story of little Jamal and his ""bad"" brother growing up in the slums and what happens in Jamals and his girlfriend's live is like a hit into your face. The thing thats even more sad is the fact that whats happening in the movie is something thats happening daily in reality in Mumbay or other cities in India.(and around the world)Yes, it has Bollywood influence with the way, but if you think its a regular Bollywood Movie than your wrong.",Slumdog Millionaire

This movie is easily one of the best of 2008, I honestly don't know how the people have given this movie a average rating of 7 here on IMDb. This movie is the heart wrenching tale of a person who has everything he ever loved taken away from him, only to try with everything that he has to regain his true love and gain more than he could ever hope. It is preformed and put together in such a way that it forgets and bypasses every love story cliché. The movie starts out a little confusing but is very quickly sorted out and understood. Danny Boyle has made a film that inspires and encourages people of all ages.To summarize the deep and perfectly delivered message of this movie; you don't have to be a genius to know the answers in life, sometimes life is just written(whether you call it fate or destiny). This movie I'm sure will find its place amongst the great love movie's like ""The Princess Bride"", ""Casablanca"", and ""Titanic"". Some people I know have problems over the fact that this movie takes place in India, but if you just for one moment let go of that and watch this movie you will instantly find out just how amazing this movie is.Even though I am writing this review now in November, I hope that you will read this review when the film comes out officially in January and go out and see it. BECAUSE WHETHER YOU GO INTO THAT THEATER ALONE; WITHOUT A GIRLFRIEND OR NOT, YOU WILL WALK OUT OF THAT THEATER INSPIRED, ENCOURAGED, HOPEFUL, BUT MOST OF ALL IN LOVE WITH THIS FILM.For my closing statement I need to mention that recently this film got an undeserving ""R"" rating, but this is one movie you should not be ashamed to have your parents take you to see.

686,thomaswayne-260-577445,We need real stories like Slumdog Millionaire,8,25 March 2018,"If you haven't visited India before, you will not know and understand the huge gap between the rich and the poor in this country. Homeless people dressed in dirty clothes, beggers on the trains, peculiar hijra ignored by the society etc. India has a huge population and to raise such a huge one is not easy. So there will be social and religious problems between Hindus, Muslims and Christians. But what we see on the Bollywood or south India films has little connections with these social situations. The glamourous life mentioned in the Indian film only belong to a small portion of Indian people. 
Some Indians will say that some scenes in the film are not true: like a child jump into the toilet and crawled out to get the signature of Indian film actor amitab bacchan. But one reality is true that in 1990 due to demolition of babri masjid there was a fierce and bloody clash between Hindus and Muslims across the country. The hatred still exit till now followed the Mumbai bombing in the 1990s, Gujrat train burning incident in 2001, 2008 Mumbai attack. People don't want to remove the scar on their heart because it will hurt a lot.
The storyline of the film is very good and flash back with the child memories of three children. The music from AR Rahman is very impressive and really touch your heart. There is no unnecessary dancing and singing in this film which almost occurred in every Hindi and south Indian film.

Mumbai is so wrongfully portrayed in this fantasized modern-day 'fairy tale'. i do not think Ebert or any other film critic has ever seen a better film which portrays Mumbai truly. and let us be true to ourselves people, Slumdog looks like a less violent, more sentimental 'Cidade De Deus'. kids with guns, a humble n honest protagonist, stark lighting, paced-up editing...Mumbai isn't at all like the city of god! about the music, A.R. Rahman is a genius, nobody can deny that. but this is not his masterpiece. he has given way better music than this; in Roja, Bombay, Rang De Basanti, Dil Se. even if he ends up with an Oscar for this, this soundtrack would still remain among the not-so-good Rahman albums.the film is a real let down at least for all the Indians i know of who have seen. its cheesy, Bollywoodish, immensely predictable and, too too clichéd...clichés which do not work...perhaps for the fantasy-driven, fairy-tale, living-in-a-dream viewers.",Slumdog Millionaire
688,clara2,Loved this film - so uplifting - you can see God in this,10,17 February 2021,"Based on an impoverished citizen from India who went on to be a contestant on ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"", the whole plot manufactures a very ironic correlation. It appeared as though any question that the ""slumdog"" was compelled to answer on this show, ultimately became a supercilious reflection of some kind of experience in his precarious life. As the plot thickened, so did the depiction relating to the intensity of oppression and emotional disarray that besieged the ""slumdog"" with regards to his whole dubious environment.This American film, which had a lot of Indian actors and actresses, as well as many Indian producers, wound up being one of the best American films ever made in recent history. The cinematography was sensational, the acting was thoroughly believable, and the directing was emphatically first rate! Any film which wins the Academy Award for best picture in the year it is made, will often times make a concerted effort to purport a unique ideological perspective to the movie audience.

Last Thursday evening at the Odeon Swiss Cottage (London) was the day set for my date with SD on the big screen!!......How disappointed I was! I left thinking was it the UK media sensationalism accorded to the film that was the cause for its success in India?? What was it about the film that caused so much hysteria in India and nominated for 7 Baftas I ask myself! Don't get me wrong. the film was watchable, and endearing in parts, but lacked any deep content that would move or inspire me, there was nothing deeply thought provoking or anything rooted in deep sentiment or fabulous imagery that left me spellbound!!...which for me.. would normally be the general perquisites to justify an award nomination!! This is a film by a talented, humble and amiable British director, Daniel Boyleso the direction was through his perspective on India and issues that govern Mumbai and its Slum dwelling citizens The film unveils how a ""slumdog"" Jalal Malik enters the Indian equivalent of the TV quiz show ""Who wants to be a Millionaire"" and miraculously answers all the questions to win 2 million Rupess!! During his cross examination by the Mumbai police (on being accused of cheating) the camera explains how Jalal knew the answers. By panning to and fro from the interrogated ""Jalal "" to the childhood Jalal, the viewer is shown, through endearing snapshots of Jalal's childhood experiences, how he is able to answer the majority of his questions. His ability to correctly answer a question asking what the Vedic mythological figure Lord Rama holds in his right hand was owed to his childhood memory of a violent mob attack on his community, an attack based on religious intolerance. Jalal recalls how his mother was brutally beaten to death, and in the distance he recalls a vision of young boy clad in a Lord Rama costume armed with a bow and arrow! I didn't think there was a need to show such a scene depicting communal violence within the context of this film, and that too without doing it responsibly, objectively and informatively. and without putting it in its true context, (which is that the dynamics of politics & social history in India have compromised communal harmony to the point that communities of all concerned faiths have been victims). Yet despite this, the country still maintains a semblance of religious and cultural unity. The film did bring to light the darker and deeply shocking side of the Mumbai underworld and its abuse and exploitation of slum dwelling children, and I feel heartened that this film has gone some way in giving such children a voice and making the international community aware of their plight. For me, the real heroes of the film were the child actorsthe young Jalal, Salim and Latikawatching Jalal and Latika's evolving affections for each other, the complex relationship between Jalal and his brother Salim, and the trios struggle for survival in a godforsaken world, was gripping viewing. The free spirited way in which these so very young actors portrayed their characters with such conviction, guile, charisma and on screen talent thoroughly deserve their nominations for the Oscars! ""Feel goof film of the year""???!!...""Mesmerising""!!??...""Unforgettable""??!!....I beg to differ.an ordinary film, depressing for the most part, punctuated with a handful of endearing scenes. Its appeal is in its ethnicity, its ""bollywood"" flavourwhich is very pastiche in the UK right nowso one might understand the popular appeal in the UK (given its passion for exotica), but why in India?? By Bollywood standards, there is nothing in the film that would stand out compared to the thousands of films that Mumbai film industry churns out each year. The fact this was a foreign film (albeit with Indian actors) directed by a Brit and nominated for seven Baftas may have something to do with it?",Slumdog Millionaire

The Indian slum setting is reminiscent of City Of God, and the manner in which a sense of adventure is brought out is excellent.This is the story of a boy who from nothing came within one question of becoming a millionaire just through the amazing experiences life had thrown at him. The romantic element is not overblown and dealt with in appropriate delicacy but this is not a story of romance, this is a story of inspiration, achievement and dealing with what life brings, whether that be sewage or mobsters.It will have a commercial impact simply through being an Indian set movie made by a British director, but an audience from far outside these boundaries can feel the emotional power and take inspiration from this. Impressive effort!!",Slumdog Millionaire
691,gandalf321,The original story Q&A by Vikas Swarup is much better,1,18 March 2009,"If you liked Slumdog Millionaire, give a try to the original story Q&A by Vikas Swarup.There is even a BBC audio drama of the original story, which is what I listened to. You know what? I thought the audio drama was ten times better than the movie. You find that hard to believe? Give it a try! (Don't condemn without giving it a fair hearing. Note that, from Wikipedia: ""The radio dramatisation by Ayeesha Menon, directed and produced by John Dryden on BBC Radio 4, won the Sony Radio Award for Drama 2008 and the IVCA Clarion Award 2008."") The story, as in the BBC audio drama, is quite different from the movie. The movie is only very loosely based on the original story. The original story AVOIDS THE LEFT-WING Clichés of the movie. Starting at the very beginning, for example, the main character's name is Ram Mohammed Thomas and while very young he is raised by a kind Christian priest (not in the slums). The left-wing cliché avoided here is that he is oppressed by society/the establishment from birth, growing up in slums with his mother killed in a massacre of a religious minority by the religious majority. And the comparison goes on and on like this, if you compare the original story to the movie version.You say that I must be a fool because the movie screenplay won an Academy Award? That's one view. My own view is that the Academy Award was political and I've lost respect for the Academy.Again, before sounding off that anyone who believes the original story is vastly superior to the movie script must be a fool, please read the original story or listen to the BBC version.",Slumdog Millionaire

The story, a game show turned into a movie, is not extremely original, but the way this one was depicted made it original and outstanding. The standard love story Bollywood plot mixed with Boyle's trainspotting nature made Slumdog a delightful 2 hour experience that I strongly recommend to all and exceedingly urge Desi's to watch, even my Indian mother loved it, although I know my father also enjoyed he may have a had a bit more bias in him.",Slumdog Millionaire

However while the flashbacks worked well I am not a fan of that type of get rich quick 15 minutes of fame game show. The underlying tone of the show was NASTY with a game show host that was as egotistical as the show trying every trick to put off the contestant, and then having him arrested and beaten and abused. I mean really! this was for me was the underlying tone of the whole programme. NASTY. Where are the 'FAGINS' of Mumbai,they were all BILL SYKES, as as for the ending well really.....The directors 'Trainspotting' had some lighter moments and basically was about self abuse, where as 'slumdog' is about child abuse.So not for me guys...",Slumdog Millionaire
694,Jadn,Just goes to show...,7,17 March 2009,"you should never believe the hype. By all accounts, this movie is good, but it is not in a league of epic proportions. The story is incredible, but nothing that hasn't been used before, and the predictability takes away from the natural curiosities that make us movie-goers interested in the first place. Given, once the movie actually begins, the directors do a great job of sucking in the audience with shock value realism and of course the staples of any good movie: money and women. The problem is that its all been done before in a thousand different ways, and the only twist here is a game show. This is defiantly a movie everyone should see at least once... but your not going to be dying to watch it two months from now. And there is no reason to see it in theaters because its effect is not action or sensory based... although the soundtrack is pretty good. If there was a choice, I probably would have went with a 7.5 but the hype is why I rounded down here. Give it a shot, but don't go expecting a movie that won 8 Oscars, or a top 50 movie spot.",Slumdog Millionaire
695,lem82,"Best thus far, 2008",10,24 December 2008,"Story telling is the original derivative of movies and is truly an art. The best stories and some the longest lasting stories of all time use elements of truth mixed with dazzling arrays of fancy. But without truth their would be no true emotion derived from the story, and with no emotion their is no connection. And you know what no connection leaves you with (just hang up a phone or have some one hang up on you) dead. This film grabs you from the beginning and you never want it to lose it's grip. It just seems to engage every inch of your being without defrauding you in any since. And while the story tetters on edge of reality and fancy you still tend to relate and connect throughout. The start with the children is just so engaging and focused that it makes you want to commission a miniseries if not a television series on the adventures of...their lives. And flashbacks really involve you in the story and the director allows you to relive along with the characters. And even as the children age and the story digresses along with the climatical scenes you still are so enthralled that you heart and head keeps telling the director not to slow done, and at least not to let up, and you hope for an ending with an screeching halt instead of a slow grind. But nevertheless all things must come to an end. I didn't enjoy how the second half was less effective than the first, but maybe that's how life is. Remember when you were a child life seemed so engaging and the days seemed to last forever, and the older you get the faster the days and time goes and less engaging and adventurous life seems. The director might be pushing this direction or maybe he just needed a correct way to end things. Top notch writing, directing, and acting. Even though I was disappointed with the lack of emotion or true drive from the Latika's character especially the aged leads. But spot on recreations and beautiful camera work. I only expected a seemingly better ending possibly less conclusive than live happily ever after with millions while your brother rots ...but, hey hopefully the DVD has alternate endings. If it were my decision the academy would have an easy decision to make for major awards across the board, and the winner is Slumdog Millionaire, Slumdog Millionaire, Slumdog Millionaire!",Slumdog Millionaire

This story about a boy from a slum who competes in the Indian version of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"" is a basic rags to riches story with nothing creative or novel about it. The acting is average, and the story-telling is nothing you would not find in several Bollywood melodramas. (Thankfully, however, what it does not have is the story line interrupted by the random fantasy sequences in a Bollywood film. Otherwise it is a story that has been told by countless Bollywood directors.) It is striking some chord in Western audiences that I don't get. Perhaps it is the realistic portrayal of the slums and Mumbai's underbelly, perhaps it is the feel good emotion that provided much-needed emotional uplift in hard times. At the core it is just a formulaic potboiler.",Slumdog Millionaire

It seems people really like giving awards to movies that show extreme poverty these days as this is the most striking characteristic of this movie.

699,TsarStepan,Danny Boyle takes on the Indian trinity and delivers the year's best picture.,10,21 December 2008,"Slumdog Millionaire is a cinematic typhoon of chaos, corruption, betrayal, chance, and romance. The foul world depicted in this film rivals the violence, the poverty, and the filth of another impoverished world, that of Fernando Meirelles and his magnum opus, City of God.Danny Boyle takes some great risks by making a movie in Hinglish, sans Hollywood stars, with a story revolving around a television game show of all things. But it works. This modern folktale works exquisitely.The cities of India depicted in Slumdog are Boyles's leading characters. Anthony Dod Mantle captures the light, the color, the dirt, and the energy of these antiheroes with an eye that doesn't flinch.Boyle does wonders with his amateur actors and his actors don't fail him. Dev Patel gives a notable performance as Jamel, who is the Indian trinity of pathos being an orphan, a Chai-wallah, and an untouchable. The Academy needs to take proper notice. Jamel's affection for Latika leads him through his odyssey that will go into the canon of great romance films, (Casablanca; The Princess Bride; The Constant Gardner; and The Fountain), where the hero sacrifices his freedom, his life, his honor, and his dignity for his love.Boyle takes the standard boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl, boy flirts with fate in order to get the girl formula and keeps the formula vivid and vital by amongst all things dowsing his protagonists in dirt, crap, and unbridled class prejudice. He does so not out of some kind of masochistic fervor held against his characters but out of deep respect for these spirited souls who will try and triumph at all cost.A warning must be given to those who are squeamish. Beware of several flinch worthy scenes: torture; violence against children; and one infamous crap scene for which I will not waste your time writing about as you probably already know about it.Best Motion Picture of the Year, (***); Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role: Dev Patel; Achievement in Directing: Danny Boyle and Loveleen Tandan, (***); Adapted Screenplay, Simon Beaufoy, (***); Achievement in Cinematography: Anthony Dod Mantle, (***); Original Score: A.R.

700,cthulhu-32,Great except perhaps for certain viewers,9,24 December 2008,"Appearing on India's version of Who Wants To Be a Millionaire, 18 year old Jamal is one step away from winning the grand prize of 20 million Rupees. Millionaire-style, a question is posed: How did he do it? A) He's lucky, B) He's a genius, C) He cheated, D) It is written It quickly becomes clear that the host of the show and the local constabulary believe the answer is C. Jamal is a slumdog, perhaps a step or two above the Untouchables, but certainly not much more than that. How could such a cipher be the very first contestant in the history of the show to reach the final question? Impossible without illegal means, or is it? The movie then reverts largely to flashbacks of Jamal's life and his experiences with his brother Salim and soon their female compatriot Latika. We are introduced to Jamal and Salim as young boys, while Mumbai was still Bombay, and the review of the past continues to a time within months of Jamal's appearance on the show. Turns out, why he is on the show is about as important as how he has done so well Slumdog Millionaire falls almost exactly in between Hollywood and Bollywood sensibilities. The run time of two hours is a bit long for Hollywood standards but short for Bollywood. While there are no true musical numbers (with the minor exception of the closing credits), the soundtrack is heavily featured (and was quite loud in the Arclight theatre where I saw it). The Bollywood chapter-like structure is in evidence but the pacing is far more Hollywood action/adventure. It is quite the unique creature and that, in itself, makes for interesting viewing.As to where the movie succeeds and falters, it is more of the former than the latter. Danny Boyle most definitely deserves consideration for Best Director this year. He sometimes dances close to the edge of music video cliché but manages to avoid triteness based upon the images and set pieces he selects. His rapid cut modes create exhilaration rather than confusion even when subtitles are required (during the scenes with the youngsters  apparently their English just wasn't sufficient). The acting, overall, is more than adequate, though in this regard, the movie might be benefiting from our lack of experience with Indian emotional expression and body language such that we have more difficulty judging realism; the few American/English tourist characters in the movie come off flat and lame, most likely purposefully but certainly not realistically. As with potentially the acting, the writing clearly does come off better in translation to a foreign tongue. With expectations dampened and exotica abounding, simplistic scenes absorb dramatic weight and play heftier than they would in the middling Hollywood fare they would normally inhabit. On the positive side, the script does manage the majority flashback structure well and rarely creates doubt as to where the story is at a given moment. The greatest weakness is the highly elementary fable plot but worse movies than this one have been forgiven for such things.When the movie was over, I thought it was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time, however, I am not sure this reaction should be taken for granted. My wife was, in fact, quite upset at the movie. The main thrust of her critique is valid, I believe, namely the movie does trade upon some pretty horrific events, many of which happen to children, in service of generating positive feelings in the audience. Obviously not the first movie to ever do this but, if one is sensitive to such things, this movie may not be ""entertainment."" Perhaps disturbingly, critics may be inured to such thinking and the average American film-goer may very well be less responsive to the suffering of alien others hence the almost universally positive reviews. Thus a caveat: if you are particularly sensitive to bad things happening to children or extreme poverty in general and you easily empathize across cultural lines, you may wish to think twice before committing to this film.",Slumdog Millionaire
701,benibarks-1,Very disappointing,2,24 January 2009,"I was SO excited to finally see this Oscar-nominated movie, and actually enjoyed it until about 30 before its ending. Then it shot downhill so badly my heart sunk with disappointment. I like Danny Boyle movies and have never been disappointed in his work until ""Slumdog."" The movie started out deliciously compelling and dark. The movie ended like silly, fluffy,contrived Hollywood (Bollywood?) schlock with the ""perfect"" ending, completely ruining the rough edginess of its beginning. Could the ending when Lativa met Jamal at the train station have been any more corny or clichéd? And how realistic that they were the ONLY two people on the platform. What was the deal with the stupid dancing scene during the ending credits? Was I watching a suspenseful drama or a Judd Apatow comedy?

The pacing is perfect, there's not a moment when the audience is not engaged, the story kept rolling, but not lacking in those tender and quiet moments of character exploration. Every scene was full of energy, humor and passion, and the plot was seamlessly put together and everything happens in a way that really hits the spot for the audience.

This is a very nicely shot movie with amazing screenplay, great story, the music is good (not the best of Rahman's work though) However, thats all the positive there is in the movie. Coming to the downside, the acting is very poor (excluding the kids , i thought they gave mind blowing performances). There are reinforcements of stereotypical India that so many Westerners believe (Not everyone works at a call center and not everything in India has to do something or the other with the Taj Mahal). Anyway coming back to my point, there are plot holes that Danny didn't think of, like how the host and the contestant could talk in the middle of a show or how the show became live!! And the worst is the fact that the English language doesn't come naturally to Indians, it sounds odd. It could have been a better movie if the other two sets of kids spoke in Hindi. I've given this movie an 8, so obviously i feel its good. But i can't believe that it won so many awards for best movie and direction. There are so many movies which were better than this one. The only awards it deserves are for the screenplay and music. Thats it.

707,NewFreedomRider,Slumdog Millionaire with 8 Oscar nominations? Huh?,6,1 March 2009,"Last night we went to see what the fuss was all about.While Slumdog is fairly entertaining, I found the overall package to fall far short of an ""instant classic"". My main gripe with this film was that the plot mechanisms were very contrived, in many cases incredibly predictable.By the time we got to the second flashback, the scene was pretty much set. There will be some horrific disaster or injustice; and then, there will be some miraculous turn of events to contrast with the evil. This formula was repeated again and again; I suppose the thinking was that this was an analogue of the Indian experience itself. I thought that it was simply clumsy and self-serving.Another annoyance was the injection of Western arrogance into the film; for example, the ""three musketeers"" scene which of course was just a contrivance to set up the dramatic final question. Two Indian children whose mother had just been brutally murdered, who had just seen a man burned to death in front of them, would be prattling on about the characters in an Alexandre Dumas novel? Really? What in the world was this director thinking? Did he really think that anyone could watch this scene with a straight face? The subplot with Salim as a gangster was quite unbelievable and discontinuous with the rest of the film. This could have been a good concept for a different film, where this plot could have be more fully developed, but it did not fit well in this movie. Another contrivance, and one that did not work well, I thought it was very awkward.With that being said, there is still enough entertainment value to rate this film 6 stars. It was worth the matinée price that I paid, but I am not certain it would have been worth full admission.Best Movie of the year? Spare me. That outcome simply shows how meaningless the Oscars have become.",Slumdog Millionaire
708,anotes,Misleading marketing.,6,26 December 2008,"Well, to start with, the English posters saying ""The feel-good movie of the year"" are not at all correct. Driven by them I went to see this movie expecting something like ""Life less ordinary"" set in India, but the only place I remember I laughed was the loo scene and even that was overshadowed almost instantly by the elder brother's behavior.So on my opinion, this movie is nearer to the City of God than to a feel good movie. It's not to much of a comedy, rather a bittersweet coming-of-age tale of an Indian boy (slumdog?).But I wouldn't say it's a bad movie, although for me it wasn't great either; I've found a lot of what I've seen before. (A bit like ""21"", after which I've felt that I've seen this movie before, if even not specifically in a Vegas setup.) Cinematography, direction is good; maybe not exceptional and the actors are good, believable. All in all, go, see the movie, but know what to expect.",Slumdog Millionaire
709,justinraaron,Review of Slumdog Millionaire: a case of 'The Emperor's Clothes',4,12 February 2009,"The film has been favourably received, gained Golden Globe and BAFTA awards and we are soon to have the Oscar verdict. However, this is a case of 'The Emperor's Clothes'.BACKGROUND Chris Tarrant's 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire?' is a popular programme: the host's manner is distinctive and impeccable and the contestants invariably interesting. I had misgivings about the Indian version being effective, as the programme requires a familiarity with the local culture. Similarly, I had difficulty with the Australian version when I was in Sydney.TV INFORMATION The author was interviewed on television and stated that the Major Ingram 'Millionaire' fraud had sparked the idea for his book. We were fed with glowing reports about the film and various clips on TV.DISCUSSION It is evident that the film is brilliantly photographed and technically assured, although some of the shots were pretentious and contrived.However, within a few opening scenes we see the hero is arrested on suspicion of cheating, is tortured and even given electric shocks in order to extract a confession. This is unacceptable and defies credibility as there was no evidence of cheating. Major Ingram and his wife were not manhandled in this manner. It showed the Indian police in a poor light and made for unpleasant viewing. I was surprised to meet a person (who liked the film) who said that the Indian police are like that! Hmm... The children from the slums uncharacteristically did not seem underfed, looked clean and healthy, had bags of energy and triumphed on various daring-do. Then there was the distasteful sequence of the child immersed in faeces and the unnecessary scene of the quiz host in a toilet with the hero. The quiz host was assured and obnoxious: he taunted the hero regarding his slum background and even did his best to direct him to the wrong answer to the penultimate question, thus violating the spirit of the Chris Tarrant show.There have been numerous intelligent films involving India: Bhowani Junction, Jewel in the Crown and A Passage to India to name a few. Slumdog Millionaire seems fatuous, distasteful and does not bear scrutiny: It gives a distorted image of Mumbai and its inhabitants. Are they all crooks and unscrupulous?It appears that many people succumb to a flavour of India, slum children and an obvious happy ending to the love story, irrespective of the detail.",Slumdog Millionaire
710,cool-buddy1,Surprising for SM to be at #32 on the IMDb top list,3,31 January 2009,"It is really surprising for Slumdog Millionaire to be at #32 in the IMDb list. It is just one of ordinary movies which are churned out in dozens each year in India.I wonder what is the hype all about? Is it because the movie is directed by an American? The highlight of the movie is the way Slums of Mumbai are portrayed (which is great), But then whats wrong with movies like SATYA ...Aamir Khan's ""Taare Zameen Par"" did not find a place at the Oscars and Slumdog Millionaire is making waves .. Boy I am slightly confused.I have myself worked at different top notch Call Centres across India for 5 years, and trust me I have never come across a single Housekeeping boy (chaiwallah in the movie), who was so fluent in English. I was wondering why was he not taking calls and serving tea instead :D .... he would be earning at least 10 times a month.If we deep dive into the plot, a minimum of 25 defects can be pointed out any moment. The one mentioned above was just a single of the lot. And on ""Well here is a little bit of the Real America Son"" ... and that $10 Bill ... Its probably the most disgusting way to discriminate a Nation against another upfront. In the movie only parts of the car were removed, In the US the entire car could have vaporized. Mr, Danny Boyle there are infinite reasons for the plight of people in the SLUMS of India or the people in general ... But the above statement. What exactly did you wanna prove ??? Or was it to melt the hearts of the Oscar Jury members ;) ... Personally to me as and Indian it was sickening, honestly.******* Bottom line ...

It shows the extremes of Indian society; the poverty of the slums with the exuberant joy of Bollywood films. Yes, there is brutality and violence, but like in real life, the scenes of pain are balanced by the sheer vivaciousness of the story.Danny Boyle shows modern India as a constantly moving and evolving place, and that is reflected in the changing destiny of its main character who will do anything to reach his goal. There's a scene involving a toilet that basically sums up the character of Jamal, that he will literally go through sh*t to get what his heart desires.The performances by the actors are amazing, especially from the child actors, the cinematography is eye-popping, zooming you right into the experience of Mumbai, and the pure strength of the story of a persistent underdog, makes this film without a question the best of the year.

713,mukund_rebel,It's a crime to miss this one!!,9,2 January 2009,"When a orphan named Jamal Malik, from the slums of Mumbai, makes it to the final question on the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, his credibility is put into question. Did he cheat? The police arrest and torture the 18-year-old, hoping to uncover some kind of illegal motivation, but instead they get the heartwarming story of his life so far. And that's why Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire is really clever. The film is not really about winning 10 or 20 million rupees on Millionaire, it's a love story, told through flashbacks.There are three different types of people: Those who know a little about everything, those who know a lot about one or two things, and those who just know what they have been exposed to over the course of their life. Jamal fits neatly into the third category. Every answer Jamal got right on the game show, leading up to the final question, was the result of an important moment from his childhood living on the streets of India. And of course there is Latika, a girl who serves as a through-line for Jamal's adventures. She is the love of his life, the love he lost. In fact, Jamal only tried out to be on Millionaire with the hope that Latika might see it and that they could be reunited.Featuring an electrifying score by AR Rehman, Boyle presents India as it has never been seen before, from the slums to the Taj Mahal. Vivid visuals combined with this City of God-like tale of a few orphan kids trying to survive in a gang-infested city. Based on the bestselling Vikas Swarup novel Q and A, Slumdog Millionaire was scripted by Simon Beaufoy, who had also written the script for The Full Monty, one of Boyle's favorite films. My only complaint is that the torture sequence that begins the film felt unnecessary to the story, and out of place in this film. But it's only a minor issue.",Slumdog Millionaire
714,keerthivas123,"A very good movie, but apparently over-rated.",8,26 January 2009,"I must admit that Slumdog Millionaire(SM) is indeed a good movie, complete with enough cinematic liberties taken by the director, Danny Boyle. But this is what also turns out to be the Achilles' heel for the movie. And the fact that the movie drags, ever so slightly though, towards the credits, does not seem to be helping it much either. But nevertheless, the performances by the young kids in the beginning is compelling enough to make you sit throughout the two hours. And not to mention the music by A R Rahman is indeed of very high quality, though I wonder whether its deserving of an Oscar, considering that this is certainly not the best of Rahman. Nevertheless, this is one slightly over-rated movie which should be watched, if your willing to accept a bit of ""violence"", though I, for one, never felt it was violent even for a moment.

This is a great movie, I'm a fan of the show ""who wants to be a millionaire?"" so I wanted to see what this movie was about and I can tell you, it won't disappoint. Danny Boyle uses flashbacks to tell the story of this boy, his memories, life experiences; but does so in a way that just flows and you don't get confused or feel cheated by what's happening, instead you sympathize and want to know more. That's the thing about this film, it's human. No smokes and mirrors here, just pure human emotion and a heart felt story. I think this is a perfect movie, or at least very close to be, it doesn't make the mistakes that many films seem to make these days.

This movie shows that, sometimes, dreams come true even though the odds are totally unfavorable. Two boys and a girl, condemned to live a miserable life with no chances whatsoever to rise above mediocrity, manage literally to turn upside down their whole universe and become nation wide famous.The film also emphasizes the disastrous social background of India's slums, where people struggle everyday with poverty and crime. It is actually hard to believe that someone who lives there has any chance whatsoever to reach a decent life standard. Destiny and love, mixed together, are the recipe of success if one truly believes in their power.

It's complete exploitation of those small kids and Directors even refuse to pay for a penny for their parents? After all, with worldwide gross over $360 million and with a budget of about $15 million, why the hell Danny Boyle ""trusts"" few thousand pounds to their funds and why those kids live in ""free housing"", ""non profit schooling""? The pain you watch in the movie is actually their everyday pain in real life, so Indian lawyers should sue Dany Boyle and his company. Finally, I felt disgusting after seeing it and I don't want to visit India at all.",Slumdog Millionaire
718,ehavig-1,Powerful Film..A Must See,10,21 February 2009,"This is without a doubt one of the most powerful films I have ever seen. I was 'blown away' by this film. The scenery is breathtaking and shocking at the same time. There were times when I had to close my eyes the scenes were so shocking. However, it was certainly an eye opener to the cruel reality of life in India. It is the most extraordinary love story which doesn't follow the usual formulas of a North American plot line. In other words, it is not a wimpy date movie but one which males and females will enjoy. Dev Patel who plays the lead in the film is amazing for such a young actor. I can't wait to see him in more films. He is the male equivalent of Meryl Streep, an actor who can say so much with just a glance, a look. And as he gets older, he will only get sexier. IMO he deserves an Oscar for this one and so does the director, Danny Boyle.",Slumdog Millionaire

Once you've seen how people live (vegetate) in this huge area, you don't believe in anything anymore.. (at least i don't)The Movie has a good pace, interesting story, involving heart, action, thrill and even comedy sometimes. The colourful scenery of Bombay and the good music do the rest.Trust me, it's hard not to like this one..",Slumdog Millionaire
720,mlzzz,An Excellent Movie...A Sure Fire Oscar Nominee,8,23 January 2009,"{This review contains no plot spoilers but there is a structural technique spoiler of sorts (which is revealed in the first minutes of the film and does not really give that much away as I have seen similar references in mainstream reviews) and perhaps some theme spoilers due to the mature content of the movie that I reference.}----------------------------------------------------------This movie was unlike any of my expectations and I like that everything about it was unexpected. It had great characters, dialog, story and structure.The story is cleverly revealed through a series of flashback sequences prompted through the game questions on the Indian version of the ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"" TV show. The movie shows a very raw and gritty version of the real India (good and bad) and is not for the faint of heart (I spent 3 weeks in India living on $15 a day so I know what is real and what most $100 a day tourists never see). The film deals with heavy, mature themes such as torture, child prostitution, poor sanitation, squalor living conditions, crime, begging, child exploitation and homelessness though these are mainly supporting elements to the very interesting journey of the main character leading up to the present and his appearance on the show. This film was successful in bringing up a range of emotions for the viewers that hit home and left a lasting impression; I found the story both shocking and moving and was left very satisfied in the end and happy I took a viewing risk on a film I had so little understanding about. The three main characters were very deep and interesting because the story led each through their own character arc of development. There were also some elements of the film that were humorous but nothing so outrageously funny as in Gran Torino (where I found the mix of comedy, drama and characters to be even more appealing and unexpected). All in all an excellent movie that I expect to have multiple Oscar nominations if not actual wins (Oscars are always harder for independent movies like this to achieve).",Slumdog Millionaire
721,alipardiwala,Phenomenal... Absolutely Brilliant,10,29 December 2008,"I'm born and brought up in Bombay, and when I first heard about this movie I was skeptical. I've seen plenty of the local Hindi movies depicting the city in all kinds of ways, be it good or bad. But this is the first film I've seen on my hometown that has really blown me away. As a fairly well off Mumbaikar, I've never really known how life is in the poorer parts of the city, and just how hard it can be. This movie showed me things I never knew about my own home. Anil Kapoor has never been an actor I'm particularly excited about, and I generally avoid his Hindi films. But he played the part of the game show host brilliantly, and I can now say I have respect for him. Another absolutely brilliant performance was from the slum kids playing the roles of young Jamal and young Salim. With an award winning story and script, this movie is easily the best and most moving film I've seen this year. Two thumbs up to a fantastic film that everyone the world over will love for its entertainment and emotional value, and it'll even tell you a thing or two about a mesmerizing city that no homegrown local would know...",Slumdog Millionaire
722,ladybugbud31,Breath of Fresh Air,10,25 February 2009,"I just got to see Slumdog Millionaire - it was a complete breath of fresh air. I think it deserved any Oscar it got. It's so nice to see a movie where I don't know the actors or what to expect of them. The story was wonderful, the acting so refreshing and the cinematography was amazing.Needless to say the criticism will continue - this movie is not what people are used to so it's obviously not worth considering!! Why is it that everyone needs to watch a movie straight from Hollywood - with a list of famous names before they will consider it Oscar worthy? There is a whole world outside of the USA and this movie gives us just a little insight into it.Maybe it is the fact that seeing how life in parts of India really is makes people feel uncomfortable? Well, it should. We have become so materialistic and take so much for granted. We are so self absorbed that we only want what we know. What about all the kids from Mumbai who came to the Oscars - wonder how they felt? We need to look to movies, TV shows from outside of the USA and see the quality of what other countries produce. There is a wealth of wonderful acting, directing and writing out there - be open and give it a chance. You just might discover something wonderful.",Slumdog Millionaire
723,arkab,"Overrated, overrated, overrated.",5,6 February 2009,"Slumdog Millionaire is one of the most overrated movies I have ever seen. It proves to us once again, that almost any film that 'exposes' the bleakness of life in third world countries/countries of political instability, scores massively with the blissfully ignorant Western audiences. The first half of the film is pretty good, in all fairness. The child artists do a fantastic job, and there are ample bizarre and hilarious moments. However, the flaws are just too many to ignore, especially for a person who is well-acquainted with the situation in these places. The way the slum children speak English is just bizarre. They have had no decent education, yet they speak as freely as any kid coming from an affluent family, incorporating words like 'gonna', 'dude' and 'cool'.(Yet, they don't know what the Taj Mahal is, which every uneducated bloke in every little village knows about). They are supposed to be Muslim, yet their mom wears a sari. Just unnatural. The young Jamal meets a beggar in a subway, who recognizes him immediately, and knows who Benjamin Franklin is.As far as predictability and disjointedness, this film takes the cake, the baker, and the bakery. One moment he is running around near the Taj Mahal, another he is looking for his 'lost love'. They are reunited, and then separated again for no rhyme or reason. The grown-up Jamal, I'm sorry to say, doesn't do a convincing job at all. His British accent comes out in spurts, making the improbable sound impossible. And then you have the villains. Mamman, Latika's husband, the host of the show- are all the absolute-evil types. One would think someone gives them a cookie for every evil laugh and lecherous comment they pass. The gangster is a bad, bad man, so he has to hang out with call-girls ALL the bloody time. Lechery is the only common quality in evil people, didn't you know? Love story is clichéd as usual, and the drama resembles that of any B-grade Bollywood movie, I kid you not. His brother Salim, is another weird character. For some very strange reason, he fills a bathtub with money and lies down in it with a gun while he waits for his nemesis.And the icing on the cake- The song and dance sequence at the end. Why? Why? Why? No reason- just cheap entertainment, the type you see in EVERY Bollywood film. So finally, everything works out for our friend Jamal, with the whole nation behind him, and everybody's happy. Except the bad guys of course. All the bad guys lose. No it's not as bad as I make it sound. However, does it deserve Oscar nominations? Hell no. So many Bollywood films like this one are made every month. Is this one so special just because Danny Boyle is the director? Probably.",Slumdog Millionaire
724,cinemafiendee,'Slumdog Millionaire' is not Exactly Revolutionary.,5,11 January 2009,"I don't know what about this feel-good flick is so much better than a film like 'Bend it Like Beckham' or 'Along Came Polly'. This award-winning film from Danny Boyle is trash even down to the dance/musical number during closing credits so tacky i will never forget. Every individual adaptation of an idea in the novel that Danny Boyle attempts falls through his fingers with the same distracting tilt-angles that 'Doubt' was so heavily criticized for. Believe it or not, somebody thought it a good idea to cast one of the actors from 'Skins', the British, teenage soap opera that recently finished its second season as the lead actor. There are some cute performances from the kids who play the main actor as a child growing up, but not anything like the child-actor performances in 'Babel', a film which most certainly didn't win best picture at the Oscars. 'Slumdog Millionaire' is a British film which focuses not on empathy with another culture but on trying to make India seem 'ethnic' or 'different'. His unnecessary speed, disorientating shots, ridiculous filters and lenses and random subtitles and characters that weave in and out of languages make white people think they're tasteful. Woody Allen did the same think in 'Vicky Christina Barcelona' by simply turning everything yellow (or 'Spanish' in Sundance-Film-Festival-lovers' terms if you know what i mean). There are several plot-holes in this, the ""40th best film in the World of all time"", but that's understandable as it is with any Hollywood flick. Danny Boyle seems to love taking other people's ideas and turning their own art into his own money as well as claiming as many awards he can for his supposed 'creativity'. The fact that 'Slumdog Millionaire' was already a cheesy, emotional and trashy novel with a readable hook, (Jamal is an Indian thinking back on his experiences as a 'Slumdog' which mean he knows the answers to the questions for 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire, winning him 20,000,000 Rupees) only means that Danny Boyle's job as a director was easier, and trust me, he fails. Perhaps 'Slumdog Millionaire' could have been a TV series with an episode for each question, and this film's weak acting, outrageous end-kiss and blatant symbolism may have been more in place. Well, Dev Patel (Jamal Malik) would have been anyway. This is not THAT bad a film. People just need to look farer and widen their minds. five out of ten. enjoy.",Slumdog Millionaire

I had no idea what to expect as I thought it was going to be some hardcore gangster flick (my interpretation of title) It had some gangster stuff in it, but that is far from the core. This movie moved me in many ways throughout. I was so impressed and loved it because I felt my friend pushed me to a gem. I am taking my girlfriend to see it tonight.

728,kneejack,Great Movie,8,18 January 2009,"This recently released flick all set in current day India is very good. I believe the Director/Producer? is British but the entire cast is Indian and in parts of it there are English Subtitles to accompany the Indian dialects but it is not really distracting. The enormous poverty of urban areas is a distraction in the sense of being sad and sadistic but is a necessary part of the story and the child actors are superb. The two young, orphaned brothers pick up a young girl along the way and part and re-group off and on as the story unfolds. It reminds me in a way of that Montana fly-fishing movie several years ago of good brother - bad brother as they matured. The flashbacks deal with the well-know TV quiz show ""How To Be A Millionaire"" whose questions are shown intermittently with the plot dealing with how the young man born in the lowest Caste answers them and whether or not he will go for or win the twenty million rubles which I suppose exchanges to one million U.S. The question also comes up with police interrogation thinking the show is rigged. ""Millionnaire,"" by the way, originated in England just like Idol did and is shown in local versions in many places including what we once called Bombay. The story is very well done even with a few grim, but realistic child beggar scenes. After the movie during the Credits there is a lively group dance scene with all the cast which is really great. /Enjoy./Jack.",Slumdog Millionaire
729,rhs-rohith,A movie which makes everyone thank God for what they have not gone through,10,15 January 2009,"There are so many comments about the movie so in this review i will not concentrate on the story line. Let's focus about some outcomes of the movie. How would I rate the movie, I will give it a 10 out of 10.For a movie watcher who has not seen how India is, this movie will give a bad impression about Indian living standards. In general, if you are watching a movie you would like something unusual, totally bizarre from day to day life. That's how movies based on Aliens, Wars, Animals of lost age, mutations become popular. May it be Steven Spielberg or Danny Boyle, they know this. Slumdog millionaire shows the worst part of Indian slums. Though this may create a misleading impression about India, One should know that this movie is an extreme scenario .people who have visited India know how full of life India is. India is a melting pot of different cultures and offers rich tradition.Some reviewers have rated the movie down as they think the India portrayal is unjustified. I came across many angry comments from some NRI's in many forums. Some comments also say that India is been viewed as a place where there are just few bunch of call centers and slums. Well if people are so much concerned may be its time they share some profits and try improve things in these slums. Just 5 richest Indian businessmen contribute to a net worth of $200 billion dollar. If some of these Indian businessmen, politicians, Bollywood crew were kind enough things would have been better. Coming to the call centres issue India has many other industries including manufacturing, IT, R&D among others. Having said that I have a concern. In this movie most of the Indian characters are shown as selfish, corrupt and sadistic. Not just that in a scene an American tourist guy say ""this the real America Son"",and hands over a 100$ note, was this needed? I don't think Danny is capable enough to judge a country, the movie is customized for western audience.Frieda Pinto(Latika) and Dev Patel(Jamal) have done well but the credit should go to all child actors who did justice to their roles and captivated the audience. Recently the BAFTA announced best supporting actress for Freida, I am not the one to decide whose the best but those kids deserve more than her(no Crab syndrome here). Thanks to Director Danny Boyle who placed the money to be paid to the 3 lead child actors in a trust that is to be released to them upon their completion of grade school at 16 years of age. The production company has set up for an auto-rickshaw driver to take the kids to school everyday until they are 16 years old. Since this movie is a great success I hope the movie crew will do more for these kids and their slums. Coming to the background score as many have pointed out the movie is outstanding due to its music. AR Rehman as usual has given his best. For those who don't know much about ARR, he is a legend. From past 16 years he has contributed so much to music that he deserves a Academy Honorary Award. Just listen to his scores from Roja,Dil se, Bombay, Lagaan, Yuva ..... the list goes on and on. I hope he gets an Oscar. 16 years ago Rahman got an entry to Tamil/Hindi industry through Roja. His work in Slumdog millionaire will get him more projects and I am sure awards will just flow.Very soon he will top the list of all time best selling music artists.",Slumdog Millionaire

Throughout the whole film i listened to every part but i still couldn't help looking around the cinema and reaching for another piece of food, or looking at other things that caught my attention.

Boyle coaxes golden performances from everyone, and its not all black and white, he gets the shades, for example from the older Salim and the wonderful Anil Kapoor as the quiz show host. But the star is Mumbai, which supplies the colour, the drama, tension and pace (helped by a brilliant soundtrack). Thankfully Hollywood didn't get hold of this, although Boyle added the love story (missing in the novel)to make this more palatable to the multiplex audience. This project recognises shifting cultural boundaries and influences, for example that Bollywood is 'the' pre-eminent film industry, 'the' contemporary purveyor of dreams and 'the' supplier of pleasures. Boyles direction is such that the film has you in its grip within two minutes and doesn't give up, even the end credits deliver. Wonderful.",Slumdog Millionaire

If you'd cut down the flashbacks without taking out any really important stuff you could still make this one in 1,5h.. but let's not talk about that. as i pointed out already the first half of the film was quite boring, but it grew better as it prolonged. and therefore it has earned an 8... maybe even a 9. but the slow start is bound to bring it down a little bit. and even the whole last question made it laughable. are the Indians really that uneducated so they can put a question like that as the last? and really the answer to the question which is stated in the beginning can only be one thing...B",Slumdog Millionaire

I bought the movie and watched it that night. Now the reason why I say that I didn't like it at first was because the book was completely different from the movie.After maybe ten or fifteen minutes into the movie, I completely disregarded what I read and actually watched it as a movie and stopped comparing. I found it to be so great, they made a real slum look so beautiful. This was definitely worth watching and I love it.If you read the book first, don't compare it. It is what will ruin a movie for ya.

735,wibas,Not worth the hype or awards,2,27 June 2009,"Just finished seeing this movie. Kept wondering why this film got such much good reviews and Oscar awards, beats me. From the start the storyline is so predictable, the boy is able to answer every question because of life incidents. One more question and a flashback to show how the boy knew the answer from real-life incidents. If such films with illogical scenes can win Oscars, then I doubt the quality of evaluation.The plot is so weak that bad guys are after the male and female leads who are the only good characters in the whole film, so unnatural. Its more like a fairytale or folklore story or a B grade popcorn movie and not something deserving a Oscar or classical status. Only exception being male lead's brother role, this character has depth and to an extent properly developed and has shades of real-life.The incidents are also so dramatic and cinematic like slum-kids in India speaking fluent English. It may be possible after the kid turns adult but not as kid. Also the scenes in which foreign tourists asking small kids to explain them about Taj Mahal.Being Indian, I amn't offended that slum areas are shown, slums exist everywhere and even otherwise lot of tourists see India they know about it and they have seen the difference in India when compared to the past 10 or 15years.The only part that I liked in this film is the innocent kids and their good acting in the first part.

737,xbsd,The masterpiece of masterpieces,8,24 December 2008,"As others have noted, Slumdog Millionaire, is a very unconventional film about a young boy who grew up in the slums of Bombay/Mumbai and goes on to become a winner at the Indian version of Who Wants to be a Millionaire (Indian series title - Kaun Banega Crorepati). The movie touches on many subjects - the hindu-Muslim religious tension, the living condition in Mumbai slums, the abuse of young kids, child labour, the list goes on. Weaving all these unconnected themes into a movie is in itself a very difficult task, but Boyle seems to have not only woven them together, but he has done so remarkably well ! Jamal, the main character represents the ""untouchable"" in a typical Indian society. He lives in abject poverty in the dirt and filth of the slum, where life has little value and dwellers have almost no chance of earning a white collar job. When he finally makes it to the seat of the most popular show of India, the quizmaster parodies that a chaiwalla (tea boy) has made it to show like this. He makes fun of Jamal, often making stinging remarks about how a low class slumdog has foolishly aspired to become a millionaire. But, soon, the show takes a more serious turn as Jamal begins to answer the questions successfully.The story begins with Jamal sitting in the interrogation room, being tortured by police officers who suspect that his feat the night before at the show was attained through deceit. When all methods of torture fails, the head officer demands to know how Jamal knew the answers. To him, it seems impossible that a slum dweller could be so knowledgeable as to outshine the very learned Indian men and women. Jamal then proceeds to explain how he knew the answers, and how living the low life of a slumdog gave him the answers to all the questions. The movie matures with every explanation given by Jamal. This culminates into a wonderful story about love, hope, determination and the real side of life.I don't write reviews in general, and very few movies have made me sit up and make the effort of writing one. This movie belongs to the genre of Shawshank Redemption, of Crash, of City of God, of Cinema Paradiso, or of It's a beautiful life and it seems that the movie has taken the best of all of these masterpieces and molded the pieces together into a movie called Slumdog Millionaire.",Slumdog Millionaire

Because probably they don't have a place like that in their respective countries. But this is all too familiar story for Indians. Have seen loads and loads of movies like this which dint make it big because of 'the no big names factor'. Hope many Indians would agree with that. While many Indian movies of a similar story line would have had a tragic ending this one is on the contrary. The movie has some superb scores by A.R.Rahman who is known in India for bringing some western styles into Indian music after Illayaraja. And the music does make an impact and adds to the story line.,Slumdog Millionaire
739,woensod,"Not worth your time, highly overrated",2,1 June 2014,"This is one of those films that are highly overrated. This movie is just plain boring and also at a very low artistic level. There is just nothing worthwhile in this film.Slumdog is based on the novel by Vikram Swarup, from which it deviates significantly (which Vikram Swarup confirmed). The movie seriously distorts the book. In the book, the protagonist is named Ram Mohammed Thomas, a name that represents both Paganism and Monotheism, and the religion of Ram remains unknown. But the movie changed his name to Jamal Malik, a fully Muslim name. Furthermore, in the movie Jamal's mother is killed by Hindus, while the Hindu god Rama presides over it. In short, the plot was changed into a ""communalized"", anti-Pagan plot. As Dr. Koenraad Elst observed in his review of this movie, ""the effect is to drive the nail deeper into the coffin of Hinduism's former reputation for tolerance and confirm its newly crafted image as hateful and a threat to non-Hindus. "" The movie was thus justifiably criticized also by India watchers Jeanne Devos, François Gautier, and Rajiv Malhotra, and in the review by Salman Rushdie, who didn't like it either.The director Danny Boyle once said that his boyhood dream was to become a missionary, and that the same spirit still influences him. Boyle also said that he made the film in part because he was unfamiliar with India - and it shows.It's a disgrace to the Academy that this movie won the Awards, when much better movies with India as a theme have not, like Wes Anderson's excellent ""Darjeeling Limited"". I also found Boyle's earlier film ""Trainspotting"" much overrated (watch ""Another Day in Paradise"" or ""Drugstore Cowboys"" instead of that crap).",Slumdog Millionaire
740,smallbob,Beautiful Made but a script a teenager could make.,2,24 January 2009,"This movie is beautifully made with an amazing look at the slums of India and I'll be going out tomorrow to see if I can't find the soundtrack somewhere. That said i found the script had the feeling that it was written by a love sick teenager with some absolutely cheesy lines and a cast of characters that feels so clichéd it's just annoying. Every Indian is either rich/powerful and a complete asshole or poor and trying to screw everyone over, including the host of Who Wants to Be A Millionaire who is played with the evil malice of a man looking to crush Jamal beneath his heel. That is except, of course for our two lovers, who it seems are the only honest, kind and decent people people left around.I can understand that the movie is trying to show the dark side of growing up poor but adding a couple of different styles of characters would make the whole thing more realistic I would think. I am quite disappointed as I had only recently heard of the movie (I live in China so I don't get to see many trailers) and everything I heard had been good. I would have enjoyed the movie more if they had just left out the talking as as I said, visually it's stunning and the music was absolute wonderful.",Slumdog Millionaire

Dev Patel has only one expression on his face when he is on the 'chair'. Anil Kapoor is irritatingly snobbish, Mahesh Manjrekar is irritating, Freida pinto is irritating... Irrfan Khan and Saurabh Shukla are passable...Rehman's music is a mix of few average tunes from the great A. R. Rehman library. he's given great music, absolutely great music in infinite Hindi, Tamil films... so if he gets the Oscar, it'll be for his great compositions over the years and not for the average 'slum-dog..' album. ditto for the lyrics of Gulzar...the main problem in the film is the lack of emotional attachment one feels with the film... i mean when Salim suddenly changes his heart or when he dies in the bath-tub filled with currency, we don't feel anything... when Jamaal finally gets Latika, we don't feel anything... when Salim kills Maman, we don't feel anything... when the film ends we don't feel anything (except irritation)...the film is an amazingly shot and stylishly edited set of gimmicks which have been forcibly interwoven in to a very convenient story...but when the world says that it's brilliant cinema, who am i to say anything... and if the world enjoys the irritating yet laughable ( a bad wannabe Bollywood) song and dance sequence in the end, who am i to say anything...",Slumdog Millionaire
742,ani_tomcruise,This is India,10,26 December 2008,"Ever go to a movie , whose story depicts the country you grew up in & squirmed in discomfort how awfully little they understand about it. I, after every such movie, used to wonder what do people really think about India ? Is this it ? How much of that glimmer of dignity is going to deteriorate after that movie ? . [ Temple of Doom & Octopussy got it Awfully Wrong . No, we NEVER ate brains ] Till now no one had ever thought of adding Danny Boyle, A.R.Rahman & a brilliant screenplay by Simon Beaufoy, who also wrote Full Monty by the way . And now that they have, they formed a combination with a Unique Universal Appeal .Jamal Malik, a Muslim former street child from Mumbai,leads us through the history of his short but full life . From Living on the trash heaps,to his place on the Hot Seat, but the ride is an exhilarating one. Born into a brutal existence , Jamal, a petty thief, impostor and survivor, mired in dire poverty, improvises his way up through the world , realizing gradually how every life's experience helps him at a crucial point . The film uses dazzling cinematography, breathless editing, driving music and headlong momentum to explode with narrative force, stirring in a romance at the same time. Danny Boyle combines the suspense of a great game show with the vision and energy of ""City of God"" and never stops sprinting.The Cast is Astounding . Perhaps the Best of 2008 .The kids were adorable little rascals. They'll be with you long after the movie is over. He makes Trainspotting , Shallow Grave , 28 Days Later . . . & now a power package of The Shawshank Redemption / Forrest Gump / Quiz Show / Pulp Fiction / The City of God. I'll VERY surprised if any other movie wins the Best Picture .One of the most upbeat stories about living in hell imaginable . This is a bright, cheery, hard-to-resist movie it's joyfulness evokes an honest cry from the heart about the human spirit.Gandhi & A Passage to India came quite close , but this movie just snatched the pure essence of India. Yes, this is how India was , this is how India is now & this is the movie you would want to see to get into the flesh of Being an Indian.Slumdog Millionaire is the PERFECT Fusion of Hollywood & Bollywood .I'm hoping for Best Picture, Best Director & Best Original Score at Oscars for this Phenomenon, though it could win others , but I feel it faces a stiff competition in both Best Adapted Screenplay & Best Cinematography with The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. David Fincher also seems to be quite in form , Oscars will be very interesting !",Slumdog Millionaire
743,jthekoz,I may be the solitary voice of disapproval.,6,31 March 2009,"The film is a victim of all the hype attached to it. For whatever reason enough people saw something special in it and a ground swell of enthusiasm propelled this film into hysterical popularity. Unfortunately there isn't enough substance to warrant the praise.Gratuitous choppy editing, endless nausea-inducing skewed camera angles (the thing I hated most about the whole mess) and a rather too contrived plot are combined to produce only mildly entertaining results.The performances by the young actors were uniformly stellar and that is where the praise should be directed.Finally, where there's smoke - there's fire. For all Boyle's glib explanations of how well the kids were taken care of and how well paid they were the truth is they received far, far less than they should have based on their contribution. I'm surprised the movie-going public let the filmmakers get away with this.It's great that their education is supposedly assured but considering the extraordinary success of the film and the wealth generated for the fat-cats in Hollywood and London these kids' lives NOW could have and should have been transformed. How on earth could they have been allowed to return to the slums most of them came from? It's real a shame.Social issues aside, I was left unimpressed and numb at the end of the movie.",Slumdog Millionaire
744,messiinter,"Masterful, Fresh Cinema",10,13 April 2015,"This movie is pure, cinematic magic. For some absurd reason, I wasn't overly keen to watch it. Since then, my attitude toward the movie has been flipped totally on its head. 'Slumdog' did everything right. It immediately invested me in the characters so that from that first moment on, I shared their every emotion. The story itself is genius. It is comprised primarily of flashbacks and side stories, but despite these ticklish mediums, Sloppy Editing did not rear its head even once. Emotions were balanced flawlessly. It unveiled uncomfortable injustices of poverty at its very worst, just the sort of material that if done in the right way (and I assure you, it was) tugs at one's heart strings without being mushy. But besides the gloomy tinge there was also a bright and playful psyche shot into the mix in just the right places. Love was also a key emotion in Slumdog that never once felt cheesy or unnecessary. The storyline had many unexpected twists which kept me on my toes. To cement this movie among the greats was a bold and diverse soundtrack which dabbled in many genres of music. Slumdog Millionaire is undoubtedly one of my favourite movies and if you have not yet seen it, give it a watch as soon as possible. Cheers!",Slumdog Millionaire

Which adds a feelings of excitement and anticipation for the viewer. It opens the world of lower-class India and the struggles that are present for ordinary people. The director showed that even in the worst of times for the main character, Jamal, the world is not a totally awful place. The fact that this character came from practically nothing and grew up to be smart enough to be accused of cheating is a key factor in the inspiring part of the movie. This movie is not a romance, comedy, or thriller, but a unique combination of them all. Although not appropriate for children, this movie should be a priority to all people to watch.",Slumdog Millionaire

The best thing about this movie was the awesome Love story of the two leads, seriously wonderful it was. the two leads were awesome.The two things that are wonderful are those two songs Jai ho and Latika's Theme.

750,fbarrie,The funniest sequence in a film EVER?,10,31 December 2008,"No sequence in this powerful movie shows the slumdog life better than the outhouse sequence: A way of life totally shocking to a middle class American who enjoys indoor plumbing. Slumdog life requires lining up to take a crap at an outhouse guarded by a child who collects a small fee. With our hero sitting on the pot, a ""customer"" shows complete frustration in having to wait to crap and goes to another outhouse. Our hero has caused the loss of a fee. The next events are played out in a shocking way: The pop celebrity arriving by a helicopter which causes thousands of people around the outhouses to run off seeking his autograph. Our hero, punished for the loss of a customer, is unable to exit due to a door pinned under the entry doorknob by the child guard. So he slips out of the outhouse in the only way possible, down the hole into the pool of crap. Covered in crap, he runs right up to the celebrity. Like Moses parting the Red Sea, with excrement covering his entire body, the masses of people part to let him approach unbarred by any brave soul. He gets the sought after autograph. This scene made me howl in laughter. A laughter I have never experienced quite so in a movie- uncontrollable. A laughter I will always remember. The funniest sequence in a film Ever! But what makes this movie a 10 out of 10 is the purposefulness behind this extraordinary scene. The celebrity/pop culture transforms the direst conditions into something that can be forgotten and endured. Our hero wants the autograph of the celebrity so badly, he'll swim in a sea of excrement to get it. This film is a remarkable critique of capitalism, greed, and the inhumanity of human kind. But it also shows that the consumer/celebrity culture can be a kind of opium of the masses. Slumdog Millionaire is thought provoking, shockingly sad and powerfully hilarious. THANK YOU Danny Boyle.",Slumdog Millionaire
751,Steveoknox24,"We expected great, we got wonderful.",10,28 December 2008,"I cannot possible overstate how moved and amazed I was by this picture. It is easily my pick for the best film of the year and, unless I've lost some of my memory, the greatest I've seen in half a decade.I've seen so many reviews about the visuals. I don't want to duel on this because there are so many, but they certainly warrant noting. Mumbai's slums radiate in such a way it's beautiful and heart-wrenching. Boyle has shot these locations in such a way that the audience can be mislead into thinking they're seeing a set. But the brutal reality is that they are not. The houses are really that close together, they are that rundown, and life is that hard. Something to think about is the use of digital rather than film. Everyone knows the debate and I'm more partial to digital (I agree that film is far more beautiful but it's become impractical). Boyle finds a way of making digital gorgeous.The greatest thing about Slumdog Millionaire is that the story and the performances take the focus off of Boyle's distinctive style seamlessly. That is quite a feat.Dev Patel was magnificent as the grown Jamal and I cannot wait for him to start appearing in more productions. Freida Pinto was just as miraculous as Latika and pulled off the type of beauty anyone can believe falling deeply in love with. You'd wish these actors had more screen time if the rest of the cast did not perform as well. However, there really is not one weak link here.The story sweeps this film away and shines as the most beautiful element. Jamal Malik is a contestant on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (in India). He's gotten up to 10 million rupees and has only one question left for 20 million. However, during a break between episodes he is accused of cheating. Flashbacks then reveal how Jamal knew each question he has been asked but ask one of their own: ""Why is he on the show?"". The answer is limitlessly touching. Dark and light elements are played throughout, many times in quick succession. You'll want to cry at how hard Jamal, Salim, and Latika's lives are but you'll also want to cry at the amount of hope that is underneath every adventure. That's the message of the film: Hope is always there. As bad as things can get, if you don't quit you have hope. This one is certainly a gem and one that you can actually smile at. That's really saying something with films like Marley and Me, Rachel Getting Married, Dear Zachary, and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button all coming out. The reviewers aren't wrong, its a crowd-pleaser (to the surprise of the audience I saw it with, people actually gasped at the ending).Romantics will swoon. Cynics will grouch until they're broken by the end. Sensitives will cry. But you will enjoy this film as it proves to be supremely magical.",Slumdog Millionaire
752,chromedreamer,Danny will get it this time for sure!,10,10 January 2009,"Anwar Kharral (Dev Patel), the 'Dull Muslim' from the famous Brit series SKINS, now he's a Slumdog of Mumbai who wants to be a Millionaire! Dev Patel plays Jamal Malik, a 18 year old boy who's in the most famous quiz show Who Wants To Ba A Millionaire. He isn't on the show for money, he's just there to get back his childhood love, hopin' she's watchin' the show. Cause he don't have any clue how to get her nor he has no idea what kinda questions he'll be asked on the show! Eventually he did answer all the questions with the help of his ""growin' up experiences in the slum"". Pretty neat! The story is written by Vikas Swarup. The book is called ""Q and A"". His debut novel, Q and A, tells the story of how a penniless waiter in Mumbai becomes the biggest quiz show winner in history. Critically acclaimed in India and abroad, this international bestseller has been translated into 36 languages. Vikas Swarup is an Indian diplomat who has served in Turkey, the United States, Ethiopia and Great Britain. He is presently posted in Pretoria as India's Deputy High Commissioner to South Africa. I always look forward to see a Danny Boyle movie & he never let me down. From his 1995 Shallow Grave, or my all time favourite 1996 Trainspotting, even 1997 A Life Less Ordinary, 2000's The Beach, his 2002's 28 Days Later was a hugh hit, 2004's Millions gave me goosebumps or even 2007's SiFi Sunshine, I wait for a Danny Boyle movie. But Danny never won an Oscar, Golden Globe or BAFTA and I don't get 'why'?! Well the Slumdog Millionaire has some 'obvious twist' but Danny make it look so smart...

Since when is Millionaire a live show, How did they all go from dark ugly kids to light studs at such a late age, How did they all learn English, Why did the brother want to die in a bathtub of money rather than escaping himself?There are many more.

754,skybugtissue,What is wrong with the world???,1,9 February 2009,"I've lived in Mumbai, India all my life. Nowhere do they teach Alexander Dumas (Three Musketeers), in fact our education is so bad people don't even have English textbooks. Examinations conducted just ask for essays and comprehension.The blinding of beggar children is ridiculous... but that couldn't be enough, could it? So we have a beggar child blinded by circumstance familiar with the face on a hundred dollar note. Man! Get a grip. The Prime Minister, President, and Industrialists wont know whose face there is on a hundred dollar note. No no wait... still not enough... Jamal doesn't know whose face it is on the Indian thousand rupee note (after seeing him receive several of them in the movie - one may ask? Dear Jamal? what now has happened of thy photographic memory?)One should wonder what direction has Danny Boyle done. If you watch any other film of the actors involved in slumdog you'll realize how repetitive and monotonous their performance is. Dialogues were really poor. Music was the only side that didn't let down. But A R Rahman has composed far better music for films other than this.The world has seen little of India... that does not give one the liberty to paint a picture so untrue and pathetic.

Anyways, the movie is exceptionally Good. Rather the BEST MOVIE of 2008. In the movie, every scene, every dialog, every character is well thought of. Character of Jamal is played by 3 different actors, representing 3 different stages of his life. All 3 have acted really well and i appreciate the performance all the supporting cast too. It interesting to see how a Call Center Assistance knew answers to all the Questions in the Millionaire Show and not because he read any book or something but knew it because he learned everything in his day to day life. Every question with story associated with it was a good way of presenting the whole movie and along we understood and witnessed Jamal's life.GOOD JOB !!!",Slumdog Millionaire

Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) is a street kid (or ""slumdog"") who appears on India's WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE? Jamal exceeds expectations on the show so the games host alerts the police after he becomes suspicious of his methods. Boyle ties together Jamal's life experiences with his answers on the show brilliantly as we see him growing up. Boyle's cast are all excellent and are mostly unknown outside of India.

757,lakshmigirish,Does contain uncomfortable scenes but what a brilliant movie!,9,10 February 2009,"Saw Slumdog Millionaire with an international women's group. Some of the facets of India portrayed made me squirm wondering what questions I would be asked by my friends after the movie... but none of it was fiction... And as to the questions about the slums of Mumbai, you could hardly expect a movie called Slumdog Millionaire not to actually show the slums, could you?!But as the movie went on, I realized I did not and should not have to explain anything. India is complicated and diverse and just because there are a number of uncomfortable scenes  of police brutality, poverty in the slums, Hindu-Muslim conflicts, children begging in the streets  doesn't mean that that is all India is about. And if that is what people take away from the movie and feel too disturbed or scared to visit India, I think we can do without their foreign exchange!! It's the same if one watches No Country for Old Men and thinks the US is full of drug dealing Mexicans and gun toting psychopaths!I guess with an English director at the helm, it is predictable for us Indians to get on the defensive thinking that he wants to show our country up as being poor and brutal where life is a struggle... but a large part of India IS poor and life IS a struggle. Living in Switzerland for the past four and a half years, the first thing that struck me here was the fact that I am indulging in escapism. You absolutely do not encounter anything here to disturb you or worry you or make you feel sad on a daily basis, whereas back home in India, you DO encounter poverty on a daily basis because it is everywhere for you to see.The cast was brilliant, the music even more hauntingly so. I was also amused at the choice of Anil Kapoor as the host considering he had trouble saying the words 'millionaire' and 'question'!!",Slumdog Millionaire
758,vjkrishnaaa,The magic of cinema!,9,13 February 2009,"I need to review Slumdog Millionaire, now. As an Indian blogger who has seen the movie, I don't want to be the only one yet to review this movie. We've heard all the arguments for and against the movie. Before I get to that, let me make one thing clear. It's one hell of a movie. Superb screenplay, lovely cinematography and top class music. I just loved it. I enjoyed this movie so much that I've watched it three times. As a movie, it is truly an enjoyable movie. It's a feel-good movie some elements of masala in it. Unless you have very strong sentiments against the movie, it is quite difficult not to like this movie. The movie is doing good worldwide because the 'very strong sentiments' are all from some of Indian viewers. In the eyes of the global audience, it is a very entertaining, wholesome movie experience.To say that this is a Westerner's portrayal of India is the worst you can do to this film. That also shows complete lack of understanding for movie as an art form. This movie would not have been as interesting if the hero Jamal (cut the protagonist crap, it's hero in the Indian movies) had not had the slum beginnings. And I must appreciate Danny Boyle's portrayal of slums. He did not show the slums so we can pity them. The focus was always on the characters and never on the slum by itself. With the slums as the background, lasting feelings or images could easily have been sorrow, pain, despair etc. Whereas the overwhelming feeling of the film was fun, adventure and joy. This is not because Jamal wins the prize and the girl. The sense of adventure and joy was spread throughout the time scale of the life of Jamal and his brother Salim. The guys are shown to have fun, be very enterprising and take on the life. If this was the Westerner's portrayal of India - that no matter where they are, they're mighty spirited people who never give up - thank you Danny! Like it always happens with movies, the value of positive and negative publicity is almost the same. All the controversies have certainly made the movie a bit more popular. I still don't understand why Indian slums should not be shown in a movie. It's more shameful to have them than to show them. Over the last 60 years, the slums in Mumbai have grown to be the largest in Asia, one of the few Asian records that China did not pip India. Remember, slums have only grown. That's a harsh reality. The India of outsourced processes, internet reach and mobile market is still not the real truth. The last couple of decades of urban prosperity has not done much to our literacy rate and the poverty line. That's the truth. Why get so defensive about it, especially when the movie is not at all about the negatives. Isn't it strange that politicians have not come out against the depiction of Indian slums in this movie? They won't because they had/have a responsibility to eradicate slums and they're not doing much about it. If we had shown the energy that we show against such movie directors and pub-going women towards the politicians, we would have less reasons to complain. Tired of seeing people barking up the wrong tree.When Lagaan made it to the Oscars, I don't remember anyone making so much noise. In my eyes, Lagaan was more shameful because it showed the Indian bunch as some illiterate bodies in an obscure village, who acted stupid, silly and emotional. None of the villagers were keen about putting up a fight except one man who leads them to an unbelievable charge against the well-mannered, smart, disciplined English. Some of the villager characters existed in the movie just for comedic elements. All they did were stupid, funny things that you'd not expect normal human beings to do. The movie completely undermined the Indians so that the hero can be a hero while you're having fun watching the movie. Lagaan was made for the Indian audience and when it made to the Oscars, it was so unfortunate that the whole world got to see how 'we' projected 'our' illiterate silly Indians against the learned British. SM has not done more damage to the image of India than Lagaan did. Isn't it hypocrisy of the highest order that Slumdog is being pilloried while Lagaan was not? If the same SM was directed by some RGV or Mani Ratnam, we'd have gone bonkers. The pseudo-nationalists always need some reason to knock down anything that's not Indian.SM is not the perfect movie. It has its faults. It has its perceived plot holes and all that. Actually I don't mind that. The movie 'Life is beautiful' was not the perfect movie, in terms of factual accuracy and hole-free plot. But no movie has ever moved me than 'Life is beautiful' did. In just about 15 or 20 minutes into the movie SM, you'd realise that looking for perfection would only spoil your movie experience. If you look at this movie very critically, I pity you because you missed the fun. Superb casting, great acting by the younger actors, Rahman's music, most lively camera work, smart direction, mementoesque screenplay with a bollywood-like ending. It's got it all.Slumdog Millionaire is the new entrant in my list of my favourite films. You can say all you want, the one thing SM accomplishes is to remind us the magic of cinema. Roman Polanski said ""Cinema should make you forget you are sitting in a theater"". I know some porns will achieve that, but as far as I know that's the most crisp definition of a good cinema. Slumdog Millionaire does just that.",Slumdog Millionaire

The acting is great, the directing better, the music even better, and the cinematography the best. The film is getting a lot of backlash for its overly negative portrayal of India and I can understand that, but in no way did it take away from the film as a whole. Very inspirational and I loved the ending!However, I do not feel that it is the best film of the year. In my opinion, I liked Wall-E, The Dark Knight, and Gran Torino better. But I do believe that it definitely deserves the Oscar, hands down. This film is better than Benjamin Button (its closest competitor). It had a much better screenplay, that acting was on par if not slightly better, and the ending was much better.Great film, everyone should see it!",Slumdog Millionaire

It pertained some very nice aspects, including some pretty cinematography, and excitingly talented young actors. However, those pieces still left gaping holes in the film, with many different features that made it worth seeing, but not worth watching.It seems as though the film picked and marketed itself with pinpoint accuracy to the naïve of America's middle-to-upper class. It gave the audience a view of the derelict of India without actually experiencing it. It let people feel like they were watching an exciting and spicy foreign film without having to deal with subtitles or anything but cookie-cutter story lines, themes and issues. All together, the filmmakers did an excellent job of taking absolutely no risks whatsoever, while creating for the entire world a genuine piece of hackneyed, crowd-pleasing refuse.It took all the will power I could not to give this movie lower ratings, and I summoned it because it did have bits of pleasure mixed in with the story line comparable to the cultural and artistic merit of Lady Gaga.

Nothing seem to be exaggerated  the slums shown are what exist in Mumbai . Little kids forced (by bad guys or by birth .. doesn't matter) into begging are what one sees in Mumbai at signals and under bridges etc. There are no unnecessary songs and no stupid dances and no hackneyed plots. The character of Jamal is slowly and steadily developed and his love is well depicted. Somewhat out of place was the ending part of Salim's character. His character was developed as a fierce person but at the end it kind of switched. But it's a small aspect and that might be only my observation.This is a great movie and goes in my top 100 list.",Slumdog Millionaire

After that, Salim orders Jamal to leave him and Latika alone, pulling a gun to his head when he refuses. Many years later, Jamal is a chaiwala at an Indian call centre, that's how he finds Salim and confronts him about Latika. They reunite at some point in the movie, but she tells him to forget about her. Drove by his determination to reach out to her, he enters the ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" show.I really enjoyed the soundtrack of the movie, ""Jai Ho"" is one of my favorite songs ever, and before watching this movie I had no idea that it was part of it.Overall, the movie was pretty great. The beggining was a bit boring, but as the story got deeper the more interesting it became.",Slumdog Millionaire

It shows the reality in India: the misery, the super population problem, the absence of public hygiene politics, the unprepared police, the children's exploitation. The movie has an original editing and a good photography. The young actors did quite a good job too.As for the storyline, I think it doesn't surprise anyone. The love story, the bad brother vs the good brother, the redemption of the bad, and the ""it's written"" conclusion are all very cliché.Anyway, I'm happy for a non-American movie achieving this kind of success.

I went into it with a completely open mind- I had no idea what it was about except that it incorporated Who Wants to be a Millionaire into it. Although I thought the concept was interesting, the way it was executed made the film unenjoyable to watch. It has some scenes that literally made me cringe, and never let up. It goes through every tortuous memory that Jamal had in his childhood. There were no light moments. It was all painful and tortuous memories. And even though the 2 characters fall in love at the end, I didn't find it uplifting at all. Just didn't live up to the hype for me.",Slumdog Millionaire

The ""hip"" titled camera angle is rather gratuitous, but overall the cinematography is a plus point. The music is interesting, but not outstanding. Now for the downside, this is meant to be an entertaining, feel good movie. Yet it contains one particularly violent scene that can be mood-snuffer. (Those who watched it know which one I'm talking about). None of the ""good"" characters in the movie are morally strong enough to the challenge the violence that they face. (Alert the police or something for Pete's sake!) I can't say more on this point without making this comment a spoiler. On the other hand, the children violence portrayed is worse than child-slavery, and I doubt it can exist in this day and age. Yet the film shows it for the sake of thrilling the audience. In my humble opinion, I highly disapprove of this. All in all, this movie is an achievement in the artistic point of view, but the morally weak story will not make the hype last long enough to be a classic. If Rocky (one of my favorites) gets 8.0 rating, I think number 7 is a generous rating for this film.",Slumdog Millionaire

The story is original, the images impressive and the cutting of the movie more than excellent. I can't understand how children can act so good in movies like this one (and others).

778,dosdanmalo,"Didn't quite fulfill its potential, IMHO",7,25 February 2009,"I feel that this is a worthwhile film that has some beautiful moments, especially in the first half hour or so. That said, while it seemed at first that Slumdog might actually live up to the enormous hype, things started getting a bit silly when the boys reached Agra. Having spent several months in India over the course of two trips, the Taj scenes were far-fetched at best and I was never really hypnotized by the film again after that. Security is very tight at the Taj and street urchins operating a stolen shoe ring simply wouldn't happen as you don't take your shoes off until you're well past the military style checkpoint that ""slumdogs"" would never be able to pass. This in itself didn't ruin the film or anything, but starting with those scenes my suspension of disbelief generally faltered and the whole thing began to feel somewhat contrived. I suppose the writer's desire to plug in the trusty old ""rags to riches"" story was probably the main reason for this as VERY FEW Indian street kids ever climb the social ladder. I feel that Jamal losing out on the money but finally rescuing the girl would have made for a more realistic (and artistically apropos) ending. Concerning Jamal, I also failed to see any physical resemblance between the adult version and the two younger ones. Actually, Dev Patel has a significantly lighter complexion than any of the actors who played Salim, Latika, or the younger Jamal.Ultimately, it seems to me that the gaggle of Oscars might actually damage Slumdog's reception somewhat as they inevitably lead one to believe that this is a once in a generation type of film. Simply put, it's not. For my money, City of God was a better executed film about street kids and Born into Brothels (while a documentary) was a superior chronicle of the Indian variety. Oh well. Slumdog is still worth seeing, it's just not quite worthy of the hype. 7/10",Slumdog Millionaire
779,RPaleja,The little movie that will wow audiences this year.,9,7 September 2008,"There has already been some talk coming from Telluride that this film is set to be this year's 'Juno.' It does have the same distributor and it is set for the same release period, and for anyone who hears this buzz, they will definitely not be disappointed.During the premiere of the final cut (in the words of director Danny Boyle) at the Toronto International Film Festival, the audience gave the film an incredibly enthusiastic response, and it went on to win the People's Choice Award. Boyle, who is somewhat like a British Richard Linklater for yet again surprising the audience with such diverse subject matter, worked his magic. He transcended genres and created a truly unique and energetic picture.Just about every aspect of this film deserves merit, and above all it belongs to Boyle, who managed to assemble such a massive achievement. The score by A.R. Rahman, with contributions from M.I.A., perfectly accompanies the action on screen. Still, it is great enough to be listened to on its own. With India as a backdrop, Boyle and his cinematographer have composed some remarkable images. The acting is roundly impressive, especially coming from the younger cast, almost all of which has never acted before.The film begins as Jamal (Skins' Dev Patel) is under interrogation by Mumbai police for cheating on India's version of Who Wants To Be a Millionaire, being only one question away from winning it all. As the inspector says, even doctors and lawyers cannot come close to the 20m rupee prize, and so Jamal, having grown up on the streets of Mumbai, cannot possibly know these things. As Jamal tries to avoid further torture, he begins to explain to the police how he knew each of the answers. Flashbacks present Jamal's boyhood and explain how he got to the show.At the centre of his journey is his brother, Salim, and a girl, Latika, who is left a homeless orphan after an attack that took Jamal's mother as well. After running from a man who exploits the trio for labour, Jamal replays the incident when Latika left his life when she was unable to catch a moving train. His uncertainty of her fate on the streets of Mumbai and his intense desire to see his first and only love again lead him to the interrogation room where the film began.Like 'Juno,' Slumdog Millionaire is by genre a comedic drama, but it becomes much more. The film asks questions about fate, righteousness, greed, and even urban sprawl. Above all, however, it asks about love in the face of the most dire obstacles, and if it can truly prosper. Jamal's story is a tragic and unfortunate one, but as seen through his eyes, it is still beautiful. The vast colour palate of India overwhelm any negative feelings, and Jamal's hope of finding and being with Latika overwhelm despair. For Jamal, 20m rupees isn't his prize. It would be nearly impossible for there to be a better picture this year.",Slumdog Millionaire

One guy did not even mention their names in his acceptance speech; the other guy mentioned only their first names in passing. Was it racism, guys?

783,nbxeh,A masterpiece that will keep you glued to your seat!,10,16 February 2009,"To me, this movie out rules any movie I have seen in recent times, like Frost Nixon or Benjamin Button, and I'll tell you why. Boyle created a movie that is a real life situation and blended it flawlessly with the popular game show, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. He made us look at the dangers and the extreme poverty of India, and the poor conditions these people live in. Aside from that, It also shows the hate against the Muslims and the oppression against them for worshiping Allah, in relation to that, the poor infrastructure of India and its currupt officials who let the offenders burn and kill the Muslims alive. What is most genius but sad at the same time is how he actually managed to get the answers on the show, how the host knew on the 10,000,000 question he was going to choose the other given answer than the one he gave him by cheating, that scene was a nail biter! Overall, this movie is about two brothers who fight for their life every day in India and go from place to place, wandering everywhere. Jamal found love and as they grew, a man picked them up and worked as beggars on the streets. They escaped and eventually landed on the Taj Mahal, they settled there for some time, and grew a small fortune. They got kicked out, and then Jamal worked for the millionaire show, he got on it, and was falsely accused of cheating by the host. He won the fortune and found his girlfriend. The end. the people who didn't like this movie are those who didn't get the message and probably don't know a good movie, but this movie will endure generation after generation. 10/10",Slumdog Millionaire

Some would call this movie a chick flick but regardless of whatever genre you consider this it's easily the best movie from 2008.

So I will not enter that discussion other than to say it is a great story in my opinion.However, I found the cinematography to be extremely unpleasing, most especially since all of the hype surrounding this piece and more over an academy award in this category. The imagery that plays in most cases, comes across as a pseudo documentary style. I realize some of the locations may have been difficult to shoot in, but with the budget they had to work with one would expect better photography might be in order.Further, the hand held nature does so very little to help exemplify the visual story telling but rather detracts from it, creating an unpleasant distraction, taking the viewer away from the drama of the story. The framing and composition is below average most of the time, finding the talent on the opposite side of the leading frame in some cases. The hard light sources are nothing shy of irritating and even some what confusing to the story telling process. I'm sorry but I really don't see it.

Only somebody with a complete lack of imagination will not relate to the rags to riches story of Jamal. His answers to the questions on the TV show trigger vignettes of how he came to learn them, virtually all the hard way, in what amounts to an epic story of survival and love. Could something like this happen in real life? No, not hardly, but neither could the Wizard of Oz - another movie fable at the same all-time great level.

The irony in the movie is truly amazing.The question about the poet Surdaas and the connection about the blindness scene was that the poet was blind even though he spoke of 'seeing' his lord.The movie constantly reminded about the book 'Shanataram' again about the history of the city and of violence.The performances were superb especially from Dev Patel and the actress who is truly beautiful. Irrfan Khan is not a Shahrukh Khan(and Thank Go for that) and never ceases to amaze.And having seen Cidade de Deus(which I truly enjoyed watching), I thought this movie is a lot more plausible.",Slumdog Millionaire

Such beautiful eye-candy, a marvelous collage of events that transpired and occurred with seamless movement. Slumdog millionaire delivers the entertainment that no one had seen for a long time in the mainstream movie industry, the artful entertainment.The critics were right, this film employs the beauty of every possible thing that may be done with a camera. The richness of colors gave the horrible slums of India a life that projects the joy of living for those who live life as simple citizens living below the poverty line. A story that pulls you deeply with every passing moment until the climactic ending where every event, every moment of the extraordinary story, culminates to the ultimate joy and success that the film deserves. The beauty of art merged with a flawless narrative and light-hearted humor creates, at last, a film that deserves more than any award for being a joyful depiction of life and a positive force to its viewers. Quite unlike last year's award sweepers, No Country For Old Men, and There will be Blood, and together with 2006's The Departed that delivered a powerful story and cinematic photography but nonetheless dark and depressing in nature. Slumdog Millionaire is a thrilling and joy- provoking success and a non-cheesy romantic story to boot.Watch and experience the beauty of film-making and story-telling at it's finest.",Slumdog Millionaire
792,r_gokul,Good but overrated,7,28 April 2009,"I finally saw this movie on DVD last night and i thought it was pretty engaging and gripping especially the first half of the movie, showing the harsh realities of kids growing up in the slums of Bombay. But unfortunately, the movie sort of fell apart in the final 30 minutes or so. Seemed like it was a deliberate part by the director to make everything right in the end and make it a feel good, love story, when instead the dark story of how the little kids grew up in poverty could have been developed further. The chemistry just wasn't there between Jamaal and Latika and we never know why exactly is he so in love with this girl and never gives up on searching for her time and time again. I have read several comments here from my fellow Indians about how they are all upset that this movie shows the ugly side of India to the western audience. i don't think it was Danny Boyle's intention to insult Indians here at all. Danny Boyle when responding to Indian critics asked them to treat this simply as a work of art, which is exactly what it is - a beautifully told love story set in the backdrop of Bombay slums, nothing more, nothing less. It is unrealistic to expect a western filmmaker to portray India the way ""mainstream bollywood"" directors do. Fact is more than 60% of the country still lives in poverty, despite the growing economy and higher incomes and purchasing power of the middle class, and if this makes you uncomfortable, then just stick to watching the song and dance bollywood musicals.",Slumdog Millionaire
793,inchakra-cinema,"Very disappointing, after all the hype!",5,27 January 2009,"Many people are being subconsciously bullied by the media hype to actually like the film, fuelled further by the silly Oscar orgy of ten nominations. Why don't we - Indians- have the guts to speak out about what we actually think or feel about the film, now that the disappointment over the film is growing? It is an absolutely average film. Apart from being obviously shallow, there is nothing of much worth in the film. It needs an idiot to believe that a slum child in Bombay talks with the British body language of Dev Patel. All the actors are so mediocre, I don't even understand what the hype is about the 'great acting'. This must be one of A. R. Rehman's most unimpressive musical scores and it is a sad irony of fate that he would be nominated for the Oscar for this one! By now he should have received 20 of them if this is the benchmark for Oscars! The screenplay is so full of loopholes and the dance at the end of the film is so badly choreographed that it would have been lambasted if it was made by an Indian director. Actually the dance at the end sticks out of the film like a sore thumb. It does not ever grow out of any context. If western audiences can appreciate and actually patronise something so illogical and outrageous, their general contempt for 'Bollywood' cinema now seems a case of moral hypocrisy because the film is made totally in the Bollywood style with every possible form of illogical excess. There is not a second in the film that touches me emotionally or can even be considered as quality cinema. It is indeed a heady mix of the worst variety of third world poverty, an internationally successful TV show, a rags-to-riches story and vintage Indian exotica. Even the geography is all wrong! It is interesting that when the kid falls off the train and the dust settles around him, he finds that he has landed right in front of the Taj Mahal. Any one who has been to the Taj would know that there is no railway line in its vicinity to give that cinematic view of India's most well-know icon seen through a sea of trash. I am not even talking about the display of poverty in the film which is a bit more complicated issue. We know that contention - we must not wash our dirty linen in public - has come from the most conservative quarters in the entire history of cinema, whether it was Italian neorealism or Bunuel's 'Los Olvidados', Ray's 'Pather Panchali' or even the more recent 'Salaam Bombay' and 'City of God'. A filmmaker has every right to explore whatever he wants. The real contentious and political issue is the reception to image-making of realities that are not lived through personal experience. Amitabh Bachchan's response can be perfectly understood in the light of the fact that he has been particularly made into the villain of the film, which was unnecessary in any case. (There is absolutely no ambiguity in the film whether Anil Kapur is playing AB.) So his reactions and critique may have grown out of a personal sense of hurt but then we need to ask ourselves, why do we like 'City of God' so much? Are we getting some perverse joy out of consuming the poverty of the Brazilian favelas or are we just captivated by its palpable characters and plot situations? It needs a depraved mind to even believe that anyone would spend their money to enjoy seeing poverty. So, ultimately the question is whether 'Slumdog Millionaire' qualifies as a film of high quality. I seriously doubt that. At best, it is a well-made Hindi film. What needs to be understood is the myth around it and the mind-boggling hype about hype itself. How did that happen? That would be more revealing about the world around us than the film's laughable claim to authenticity, that too legitimised by gullible Indians themselves.",Slumdog Millionaire

I mean some of the stuff was partly true but many many many things were just horrible. We are a country thats progressing and showing us as a nation filled with just cheats, prostitutes and mafia was not the best thing to do. i am a very proud Indian and i will accept the things that are true, but the movie just proved that everyone else just assumes that it is a country where either people run around trees and sing and dance in co-ordination or starve on the roads and dive into their own waste. people who don't understand some things shouldn't make movies that so blatantly abuse the country and it's people.Danny casted Dev Patel, who is a brilliant actor but for a person to portray a role like Jamal's you would at least pick an Indian actor. Which slum dweller has an accent??? i mean come on! The biggest mistake was the casting and there were many factual errors. Now what was good. the direction was brilliant. The entire cast was mind-blowing. Dev and Frieda are truly remarkable and will go a long way. Two very very enthusiastic thumbs-up. The soundtrack is one of A.R Rahman's best work. As a technical movie it was one of the best movies i have seen. But that's it. If you take away the technicals the movie is a very poorly planned out film. Sorry, but it's true.",Slumdog Millionaire
795,rdsoxs86,Slumdog is bound to sweep the Oscars,10,7 February 2009,"I saw the movie before its appearance at the Golden Globes. It was in fact recommended to me by my financial adviser. I guess its a punchline. Anyways, Slumdog Millionaire is all what the critics are claiming as the best movie in 2008. Slumdog Millionaire is about a teenager, Jamal (Dev Patel) who wants to get the attention of his love interest by going on the Indian version of ""Who wants to be a Millionaire?"". Jamal grew up in the slums of Mumbia, India and received little education. Does he cheat or just know the answers? (Didn't want to spoil it)Here are my grades: ACTING: AWhere did they find these actors and actresses? This is Dev Patel and Freida Pinto's first movie and it's a breakout performance. The rest of the cast has been in Bollywood for a while.SOUNDTRACK: AAll tracks stick with the Indian culture except for MIA Paper planes. Great selection and the cast does a musical number during the end credits.OVERALL: AI can't believe that this movie was so close to going straight to DVD.",Slumdog Millionaire
796,thisisanunoriginalemaila,"Average, yes, but novel as well.",5,21 March 2009,"First off, I think that Slumdog Millionaire has received much more attention than it deserves. I think its a product of a disillusioned public contriving the understanding that something ""Independent"" is better than a wide release. This movie was quiet release and was set as far away from Hollywood as could be--India. Maybe it has become so popular because of this misunderstanding.Regardless, I enjoyed watching it, but just as I enjoy eating candy. This movie was an indulgence--a childish and predictable story being supported by mediocre actors. Sounds like most other movies? Definitely. Of course I laughed on occasion and sympathized with the characters, but I did that with Marley and Me too, which I feel is the same caliber of film as Slumdog. Of course, though, Marley and Me has been deemed one of the worst movies last year. I don't really understand how many people discern which movies to like and which movies not to like. I did, however, particularly appreciate the novelty of Slumdog Millionaire. I liked seeing India on the big screen. I was educated as well as somewhat entertained, which is all I can ask from any movie. This movie, though, out of all movies, did not do that so fantastically that it should win 10 Oscars. Maybe I'm missing something.",Slumdog Millionaire
797,edwardclinch,A Good Film to Begin Understanding,9,26 June 2013,"There ought to be more films that do this. Good stories taking place with believable characters in lands that the rest of us are seldom exposed to. Yes, some aspects were a bit fantastic. But it showed us a different world, a different culture, new actors and characters who do not fit the Hollywood mold. This was original.Well done on that count.For many reasons, Hollywood does not portray the greater world that well. We do not get very much insight to foreign (non-Western, non-US) cultures. Which is a shame, because film exists to teach us so much, if we could figure out how to market it. Sometimes there are breakthroughs, and I think this is one of them.When I was attending UCLA ten or more years ago as a graduate student (please do not pigeon hole me as pretentious for saying that), I began to believe that if a person was capable of understanding the sub-continent of India, then they could probably understand the complexity of the whole world.This movie presents a beginning of that peek into a separate world that we all share.What other Indian films (or rather, movies about India), give us any knowledge of it? The Jungle Book, A Passage to India, Gandhi, Patrick Swayze in the City of Joy. Usually the characters have a strong British influence, even Gandhi. The Jungle Book is mostly animals, some of whom represent more American jazz than anything from India.There are authentic and classic Indian movies out there. I watched the Apu trilogy as a film student. And I am sure there are more recent Indian made serious and entertaining films today.But a movie like ""Slumdog Millionaire"" breaks through the 3rd world wall, and helps us all see our planet more clearly.I hope this would happen more often.And very often, the same old actors are in the same old plot lines.I know Tom Cruise and others of his ilk like to work, but do we always have to get the same ones? Money awaits. And this is an investment in many peoples' lives as much as one actor, I get that.But our minds continue to atrophy while great scripts and world themed adventures flounder in the ether.We need more like it, but different of course.",Slumdog Millionaire

Everybody speaks English!! American tourists who just had their merc stripped off give out another 100 bucks(are they stupid?)!! On one hand the movie is set in the dirtiest and most vicious of places in mumbai, on the other hand it has the noblest of all concepts, the Hollywood version of romance!! Other than the two toddlers, the rest of the actors playing the two brothers at different stages in their lives have ""Non Resident Indian"" stamped over their faces!! Young wannabe criminals don't look like Salim does, neither do they carry colts?!! In beggar camp Latika, while crushing red chillies, wears rubber gloves?!? Well she wasn't exactly doin the dishes in her kitchen was she??The movie says that the makers took the worst of India in one hand and Hollywood in another and decided to bridge the gap!! But the gap is just too big for one person or a whole generation of people to bridge!! I did like the youngest of the actors though, the movie remained palatable till they were around!!I also hope this movie does something to draw the attention of the world to how people in some parts of the world live in abject poverty, don't know what, if at all anything, that will result in though.",Slumdog Millionaire

All the actors acted well and gave us our money worth. danny boyle did a great job directing this movie and also the places, the locations were great and went along with the title.Dev patel did a great job incarnating the person he was supposed and really showed a lot of emotion in the movie. Freida Pinto was beautiful and did he part in the movie. Oh my god, the child actors did a fantastic job,even better than the rest. the bollywood actor anil kapoor also did well.

800,tjbibuld87,Not just one of the best films of the year...One of the best films of all time,10,14 December 2008,"I'm not going to talk about the originality of a gritty subject matter, or a love story, or a coming of age story. The late, great Joseph Campbell once said that we have only a finite pool of human stories to tell, and we continue to retell them throughout the ages. What makes a story truly unique is its telling through the eyes and experiences of particular generations. What I am going to talk about is this particular version of a love story, a slum story, a coming of age story, a story of fate, and a story of perseverance.Jamal Malik: the films hero, is the Indian Oliver Twist: A boy from such tragic and unfortunate circumstances, and yet at the same time so persevering, so pure of heart, you can't help but root for him. His love for an idealized fallen woman, is so chivalrously unwavering, that you cannot help but be overcome with such intense longing for its bittersweet culmination. The characters are so well developed, that the strong performances seem like hooks that immerse the audience deeper into the multi-sensory experience of this film.The genius of this film however, is in the method of its telling. It is an old story retold through the eyes of Jamal Malik and his experiences. The film's most creative points are in its narrative: its use of flashbacks, its editing, the seamless use of montage to mark the passage of time, its use of color and sound, and its ability to use all of these elements to create a dynamic film experience.I will also tell you precisely why this film will go down in history as one of the best ever made. It is an emotionally arresting modern fairy tale, that will obliterate every cynical cell in your body. (believe me I have MORE than my fair share of cynicism.) I find that this film takes you on a journey through tragedy and depravity, and shows you the only solution to enduring the barren landscape of this world. And that solution is through believing firmly in the human connections we make with one another. That despite the tragedies we endure, if we believe in love and those we love whole-heartedly, we can overcome anything. This is a film that shines a light on the parts of our soul that are called upon in hard times; a unifying factor that pervades us all. And THAT my friends, is what makes a GREAT film.Forget film to be what it often is: a tool to convey reality, to convince you of a story's believability. Instead remember that film is merely a medium through which truly beautiful art can be created. ""Slumdog Millionaire"" made a hopeless romantic out of me, and anyone who sees this film will not be able to help themselves but follow suit with me, and the throngs of fans who flock to see this film over and over again.",Slumdog Millionaire
801,moviedovie,An unbelievably believable movie,9,4 January 2009,"I have been on a movie watching spree recently and have subjected myself to a helluva lot of them ranging from downright pathetic to some very wonderful. But none of them could give me the feel or the punch that you secretly crave for from each movie that you watch. Maybe it was this feeling that had eluded me that made me watch dozens after dozens. But Slumdog has put this desire to a rest. The speciality of this movie is the audacity it contains. Capturing the essence of India in a way that is neither too artistic to be considered soft nor too gore to be sidelined as rash. The vision behind this movie is definitely laudable. The actors have been chosen very very painstakingly and the performance that they give out takes the movie a few notches higher. The script, although rather flimsy, has been told in a very convincing manner. The music remains true to the nature of the movie, neither going overt nor getting lost in the chaos. Count on Rehman to beat himself. The narration was flawless, it reminded me of Pulp Fiction. After watching the movie, you would feel a certain kind of happiness that cannot be put into words easily. And I credit the director for having created that aura. Overall, I must say, this is a breakthrough movie. The story is old, the plot is oft abused, the theme is offbeat but the perspective taken makes this movie a standout among the crowd.Watching this movie is an amazing experience and I am sure worth an encore !!",Slumdog Millionaire
802,nikk1988,Uplifting but Simplistic,1,24 December 2008,"I wanted to see this movie for ages seeing the hype it received in many international film festivals.And I must say, while not being exactly a letdown, it did not seem to quite justify the hype.The film is modern taken on the rags-to-riches story set in Bombay,India.The bad things about the story first: The film is very predictable,you can tell the whole story of the film in approximately 10 mins.All the characters are either black or white,excepting the hero's brother.The climax was a let down,typical of bollywood films(a frantic climax where somehow everything becomes right!).And as an Indian, yes,i did find the part about ""real America"" offensive.Inspite of these faults,the film does strike a chord in one's heart.The cinematography is brilliant,the city of Bombay is presented in a whole new light,one can see beauty amidst squalor.A.R Rahman's music adds to the mood of the film.And finally,the movie is a triumph of human spirit,of fighting against the odds and yet surviving,and for projecting this superbly,this movie is worth a watch.No marks for plausibility though,but as the movie says "" Some things are written,are meant to be"".Go watch it,but put your cynical self to rest.All in all , i felt the movie was good but not worth all the Oscar hype it is getting.There are better movies coming out of bollywood then this movie",Slumdog Millionaire

I immediately determined that it was some sort of gangster movie involving a whole lot of guns and violence, and decided I would probably end up getting it from Netflix down the road for kicks.Then Oscars night arrived, and I watched with interest as Slumdog Millionaire took one gold statue after another. My interest peaked when A.R. Rahman and M.I.A. took the stage to perform a few of the songs from the film. I was utterly shocked, not only to discover the true nature of the film through the music, but by the music itself. It was beautiful, artfully crafted, and it captured me in a way no movie soundtrack has ever managed.After that night, I knew without a doubt that I had to see this movie, if only to hear that music again in context.So I went, reserving judgment until I'd seen it in its entirety.In my humble opinion, this movie deserved MORE awards than it received. It was completely unique and totally unforgettable. This has become my favorite movie, which says quite a lot, considering the many movies I've seen in my life.See it.

805,ssoffline-1,India from the west mirror - but still a good one,8,29 December 2009,"So here we come to 'Slumdog Millionaire'.The rating is high because of acting and screenplay. But coming down to the real basics, the music of the film got Oscar, is still not the best of A.R. Rehman , check out 'Dil se', 'Taal', etc. to know what good music is all about.Why it got Oscars ?Headline tells you the story.The movie starts in a police interrogation room and takes you through numerous small stories of Jamal's life, touching all nooks and corners of problems in India, the dark gallows of beggar rackets to bhai's of Mumbai who dictate the terms in real estate markets there. The religion problem was not missed either, not even the irresponsible call centers and yes the good America also made an appearance :P.The movie makes a happy ending after all this hustle and bustle.Sadly enough all this is true, but hey people there is much more to the country than what this movie tells you. The only advice of mine please see it with an open mind and don't stereotype the movie, it has a more subtle message to send which very few will catch. It talks about hope and it talks about growth, it talks about change and it talks about triumph. A good one time watch with some strokes of comedy as well.So people have a ball watching this, though your views might differ from mine the movie is not as good as it has been put on to be.",Slumdog Millionaire
806,whispersnwits,"Well, what a movie this is!",7,13 January 2009,"Well, what a movie this is! I have been a regular visitor to the IMDb site and especially to the comments section. It never occurred to me till now, that i might want to post my views here. But this movie has made me do it.Each and every aspect of this movie has fascinated me. Be it the direction, music, screenplay or the casting. No wonder why this movie has already grabbed four of the prestigious Golden Globe award. And i feel its gonna be a sure shot winner in the Oscars too.My first appreciations to the Indian Novelist, Vikas Swaroop and to his debut novel ""Q and A"" on which this movie is based. Though i haven't yet read the book, i am sure it would be as good as the movie. I will be looking forward for his works in future too.Danny Boyle (Director) and Loveleen Tandan (Co-Director) together with Simon Beaufoy (Screenplay) have beautifully brought this novel alive. The way the uncertainties in the lifestyle of a pure Mumbaikar is portrayed, is fantastic. The whole movie is a mixture of bits from past and present and i couldn't stop noticing the way the two time-frames blend together.The music by the Indian legend AR Rahman is quite lively and melodious. I especially liked the score when the protagonist (Jamaal) waits for his lover (Latika) in the VT railway station and to the point when his brother (Salim) kidnaps her outside the station. It is a lively mixture of Indian music with the western.The cast have to be appreciated too. All the actors, actresses who played the lead characters Jamaal, Latika and Salim did a great job. Anil Kapoor (Host of the show) and Irfan Khan (Inspector) though they were in mediocre roles, did quite well keeping up to their usual standards.Last but not the least, thanks a lot to the producers who pinned their efforts in bringing this novel to the silver screen, when most of the Indian production houses had backed away.I rate this movie 9/10 without any second thoughts. Great Movie.",Slumdog Millionaire

All the actors seems to be natural, not actor but real human , kids were marvelous , the most natural acting. hard lives of slum kids and country element make movie a perfect watch, natural speaking and natural expressions , everyone seems fantastic, Anil Kapoor was marvelous portraying Amitabh Bacchan's character of KBC's(Indian version of who want's to be a millionaire) host.

Nothing is special in that except typical Slum area, that also very simple in Indian movies, then in some situation the Background Music gives some energy, rather than nothing special I could find on that...... The director allowed too many chances for Coincidence....Starting from Coincidence and running through Coincidence and ending with Coincidence............

I would say that in my view Salaam Bombay was a much better film because it had a poignancy in it and also the music was pleasing. Since i am from India i really didn't like the characters speaking in English especially the leads (slumdogs).Music,Cinematography and editing are the three things which can create the mood. Here all the above three are westernized.I don't want to go deep into this movie and criticize thoroughly rather i would like to say that this movie is a poor slick flick about the poor which lacks true Indian emotions and Indian feel of the movie.",Slumdog Millionaire

That is what i loved most about it.Danny Boyle(of Trainspotting fame) captures Bombay(Mumbai) like it is .I am amazed by the level of detail shown in the film cause it's ironic as even Indian directors often restrain from showing the grittiness of Mumbai slums.A story about a chai(tea)-wallah,Jamal who is detained by the police on suspicion of cheating on the game show ""Who wants to be a millionaire ?"".Of the cast,the child actors seem to outperform the lead actors.I strongly recommend this film especially if you are visiting India as it may serve as a ""travel advisory"" for you.The only thing I couldn't understand is how they got the British accent all of a sudden.",Slumdog Millionaire

India was an excuse and in a way and I found that annoying. This was not as bad as say the ""Last Samurai"". I mean both the director and script writer made an attempt to avoid some obvious clichés - they did not put emphasis on a rural India without any technology, on the cast system or a pseudo-spiritual nirvana. Yet, they have not grasp the essence of the India. You could transpose their story in China, Africa, Mexico and it would hold the same.For lack of cultural authenticity I give 7 out of 10.

816,mnsship,True love in the slums of India,8,6 January 2009,"Slumdog Millionaire tells the unforgettable story of Jamal Malik. An unlikely contestant on India's version of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"". The film opens with Jamal being ""interrogated"" by police for his ability to answer questions on the show that he couldn't possibly know, therefore he must have cheated. He doesn't deny anything. He simply refuses to answer their questions or defend himself. Is he protecting someone? When he finally opens his mouth it is to simply say ""I knew the answers"". How he knew the answers is where the story unfolds, one game show question at a time in flashbacks beginning with his early childhood. As the police listen to and the audience witnesses his explanations to how he knew each question we begin to realize that each answer is associated with heartbreaking, horrific and sometimes humorous memories of his life.Slumdog is a movie that should not be missed. It should be required viewing for all teenagers in this country and industrialized nations around the world. It is commentary on a society that would prefer to brush aside the problems it creates instead of taking responsibility for its actions or inaction. It is a lesson on what can be accomplished in this life no matter what kind of cards life has dealt you, if you persevere and try to do the right thing. The movie though is above all a story of true love. The belief in the destiny for that true love and that it can conquer all.",Slumdog Millionaire
817,poonaatsoc,Just an amazing movie,7,9 January 2009,"An excellent movie to start with, right from the direction to the acting. More than half the movies that get released from India, or should I rather say Bollywood are crap, though the directors can't be blamed for it as it's the public that demands for commercial(albeit unrealistic) movies. One of the things that wowed me is the editing/screenplay. The initial sequences where the scene flips from the cop slapping dev, and dev entering the game show was brilliant.The only flaw I believe is that the movie isn't entirely filmed in Hindi. You don't see underworld gangsters conversing in English in India, and neither can one expect two brothers who have conversed previously with each other in Hindi, to meet some fine day and start conversing in English. This was unrealistic. The director could have filmed in Hindi and resorted to English subtitles. Anyways the strengths of this movie encompasses all its weaknesses. This movie reminded me of Blood Diamond, which was the other recent movie where I felt as if I was a part of the plot. Any bit of praise would not commensurate for the brilliance shown by this movie. I would be terribly disappointed it it misses the Oscars. The entire plot, the acting has been outright natural. Credit to the director for portraying the scene back at the slums in Mumbai, in its original unaltered self.A movie that I would recommend to all.",Slumdog Millionaire
818,jamiewong100,Slumdog has a similar story to a short film titled Boot Polish made last year,7,11 January 2009,"I went to watch Slumdog Millionaire and it was a very good film. The film is kinda similar to a short film titled Boot Polish made by a new British film director Aneel Ahmad in 2007. Both stories covering the same premise. Kid from poverty and saving a girl at the end with great music and cinematography. The perfect cocktail for a Bollywood MovieBoot Polish has no real dialogue and it was more tailored for the cinema of Satyajit Ray. Visual style rather than storyline which needed to be stronger. But its very Bollywood as well and has a cross over genre feel to it. It's a wonderful start by a novice filmmaker and it is unquestionably a real accomplishment.Slumdog Millionaire as a film was crafted for western audience. It was more of a roller-coaster ride shot at a high speed rate. I think the only thing that let Slumdog down was the English dialogue, it just made it seem unreal.Both films Boot Polish and Slumdog Millionaire are both pioneering cross genre Bollywood films and they are very difficult to create because you are trying to grab two very different audiences.Many Asian film-goers usually feel that British directors tend to be insensitive when shooting abroad, but i feel that Ahmad & Boyle had researched and perhaps adopted the idea of shooting Boot Polish & Slumdog Millionaire in a more Bollywood Style - Hence Romeo & Juliet. So it would appeal to the masses.I highly recommend Boot Polish if anyone can get hold of it! There are some great new film directors emerging within the British scene. So it's exciting times. Ahmad has had great critical success with his shorts by audiences across the world and his films have been endorsed by so many established film directors - Ridley Scott, Quentin Tarantino, Mike Leigh, Alan Parker and Peter Carlton who is an executive at Film 4 (co financed Slumdog Millionaire), the list is endless.Danny Boyle should give Aneel Ahmad some mentoring advice because he is sure to be one of the next best film directors we have in England.",Slumdog Millionaire

It revolves around the show and the life of Jamal.The story is based on a novel ""Q & A"" by Vikas Swarup and Screenplay by Simon Beaufoy. The story is very original. The movie is shot in-and- around the streets in mumbai and other places in India. Dev Patel is awesome, simply brilliant. His expressions are so natural, you tend to feel and think like him. This combined with awesome screenplay and direction keeps the audience glued to their seats. I highly recommend this movie.

Fantastic cinematography combined with excellent acting from Dev Patel playing Jamal Malick a young man facing challenges which lead him to one place in the hot seat on ''who wants to be a millionaire' .Supported by an excellent supporting class [ the children playing the younger Jamal are truly exceptional] Slumdog Millionaire is a film which subverts the Hollywood narrative and looks at another side of life which is not seen by many it shows how courage above adversity triumphs and how it is destiny which leads you to a place which will change your life.,Slumdog Millionaire
822,atikin1983,Zero out of Ten.This piece of shoot is a very bad piece of non sense,1,2 February 2009,"Some Indian people will do anything to earn American dollars.The situation in Indian cinema of the last 100 years is very confusing. No one likes art cinema (X Ray,Railway Bhatak,Pampalkrishna) where these intellectuals show poor people.In a film disco dancer mithun is showed as a poor hunter.X Ray has shown Gabbar Singh in a role of players of chess.Pampal has shown kerala super star Mum ooty.So rich people do not like art cinema as it shows only poor people.Sunil Dutt wife angry over X ray because in parliament x ray showing poor people. Indian intellectual class don't like Hindi films as 180 minutes full of songs,dance,comedy and action.It is like a spicy pizza full of different flavours.So Indian cinema is very confused state.Shyam Benegal making a silly film about village post man in Sajjanpur. Each time a non sense like this is made,it puts to shame all the good work which Indian software professionals are doing in India.Such a piece of an idiot's fantasy puts to shame all the Indian people who work for NASA in USA.This is because people will think that India is a poor country.No India is not a poor country but India is a golden sparrow.It is a pity that an Indian film ""Stars on Ground"" is not appreciated by west people.It is about mentally retarded children who are trained by a mentally retarded teacher.Many people write to Indian newspapers why Oscar is not giving a special prize to a gem of an Indian film ""Stars on ground"".A word about bad actors.The actor who played the role of police inspector cannot speak English at all.I happened to see him on TV and boy ! he was struggling to utter even some of the most basic sentences.I wonder he must have also been picked up from some Indian slum.Some of my friends told me that he has also acted in other English films.This makes me feel as if boorish guys can easily get roles in Hollywood.SM is sado masochistic film.The only person who has gained from this bad film is its casting director Loveleen Ton Ton.If she can earn lot and lots and pots and pots of money,there would be millions like her who have done mass communication who would do casting job of casting poor Indian children to earn shiny dollars making a mockery of India's progress.What a shame !",Slumdog Millionaire
823,vd-imdb-9,"Watchabe bullshit about keeping trying and ""love""",7,30 January 2009,"Watchable is a keyword. It's really is an OK movie.Yeah, it's a fairy tale about a male building a nest for a female. Life is so tough and cruel, but love will overcome everything. You'd better believe it.Too frequently during the movie I had the feeling ""I know earning lots of money is not THAT important"", so why am I expected to be so excited? I guess it's just an appealing theme, conveniently re-marketed as believing in destiny, and trying harder. Thanks!Anyway, the main characters are cute. Not sure how truthful is portrait of the scene - the India, but it does look cute too. Like I said, it's a watchable movie.",Slumdog Millionaire
824,steve-4406,Not bad,6,4 February 2009,"Not a bad movie, a bit drawn out but worth watching compared to some of the rubbish that gets released. I thought it could have been a bit more hard hitting in places. I would imagine it was not easy to shoot this movie.It was interesting to see how rude the presenter was and yet it seemed very acceptable to the candidate and audience so now I have a better understanding of Indian humor.I am sure that the police action is normal and yet no one complains.His bruises got fixed pretty quick for part 2 of the showRemind me not to apply play when next in IndiaI wonder how much of the child abuse still goes on",Slumdog Millionaire

826,keithbate75,Why Does Everyone Think This Film Is Amazing???,1,5 March 2009,"I've just been looking at the IMDb top 250 films and was amazed and shocked to see that Slumdog Millionaire is ranked at #46 in the best films of all time!!! The only question I have to ask is why?? I went to see this film full of anticipation and excitement, not only because its a British film with a British director, but because I hadn't read one bad review or heard anybody say anything remotely negative about it. I'm very sad to say that I've never been more disappointed in my whole life (with the exception of the recent Star Wars films).I'm not saying that the acting is bad because it's not, its actually very good. I'm not saying that the direction or the cinematography is bad because its not, the film moves at a nice pace and is beautifully made. It shows India in all its magnificent glory and gives an in depth view of the poverty that many of its people, especially children, have to endure. The music is good and it has the ""feel good factor"" that i had been reading about for months before seeing it.What I couldn't believe was how predictable it all was. I was under no illusions from 5 minutes into the film that the main character was going to win the money and get the girl and it made the whole experience incredibly boring. It was a journey through a series of bumpy, unbelievable stories and situations that eventually (2hrs later) culminated in the downtrodden hero winning a fortune and ending up with the girl, yawn!!! Lets be honest here too, the girl was stunning and wouldn't have looked twice at the big eared, geeky main character.I feel bad writing this review because its the first time I have written about a film on IMDb and I would love to write something positive. Unfortunately, I can't sit back and see this film rated as one of the best ever when in reality its no better than one of those 50's Disney films where you know exactly whats going to happen from the start but you watch it because it makes you feel warm and fluffy inside.I'm astonished it won best film and best director at the Oscars because it's a well made, straight to DVD film at best. I'm giving it 1 out of 10 for the simple reason that this film doesn't deserve to be in the top 250 of anything and I'm hoping that my score brings it's average down. If I wasn't scoring it based on this decision I would give it 4 out of 10 and thats being generous.",Slumdog Millionaire
827,andy-kirchmayer,Overrated,6,13 October 2009,"It's never good to watch a movie with great expectations. Either you just get what you waited for anyway or you are completely disappointed. Well, what's wrong with Slumdog Millionaire? Maybe I shouldn't have read anything about it before watching - but as it won so many Oscars, it's hard not to find out anything about it. So the storyline was clear - some poor boy from the Mumbai slums gets the opportunity to win a lot of money. And the movie somehow has to point out how it is actually possible for somebody who dropped out of school as a child to know all these answers.Well, the acting is fine and you really get to know the main character. It's hard not to like him. The music's good, the antagonists are as bad as you'd wish them to be. So it's about the plot. Slumdog Millionaire is a modern-day Indian fairytale. Everything works out for Jamal. Don't get me wrong, that's all right - Jamal has the amount of luck of an action movie hero (be it in ""Die Hard"" or in ""Taken""). But they normally aren't rewarded any Oscars.The Academy Awards Jury seemingly longs for happy endings. But this one got so many Oscars because it's a movie that gives you a good feeling. From rags to riches, and besides finding the girl of your dreams - all of this happening in India with its social problems. Some of those Oscars are symbolic for the message you might want to receive from the movie. Everyone can be a winner. But that's cinema. A real-life ""Die Hard"" wouldn't have had an happy ending. It's fiction and you gotta accept it. Maybe some people don't wanna accept that and thus rate Slumdog Millionaire this good.For me it's nothing but a pretty enjoyable drama. But an overrated one.",Slumdog Millionaire
828,anupama-salunke,not worth watching,1,23 April 2009,"when i saw the movie i felt so cheated by the movie reviews,its really a depressing movie.except for the background score which is OK compared to rehaman's work in earlier movies like (lagaan,dilse,guru) etc.and the performance of the child actors were amazing.other than that there is nothing great about the movie. some scenes in the movie are too disturbing and they project India and Indians in a really bad way. especially the instance when a US tourist car is looted and the driver hits Jamaal,and the US lady offering some dollars to Jamaal saying this is what US is!(sooooo unreal) this movie is nothing but a depiction of everything that is ugly about India and is just every scrap and dirt picked up from every corner and piled up together to try and hit back at the growing might of India. and it is hard to digest seeing the young actors speaking in English. definitely not worth watching.",Slumdog Millionaire
829,rr-rr-rr-1,And the moral of the story is...,3,25 June 2009,"As art, it's reasonable. Although I'm a fan of Boyle's work since Shallow Grave – and I consider Trainspotting one of the best movies of the 90's – Slumdog Millionaire disappointed me. It's the classical Hollywood self-overcoming cliché with the ""I love you"" conclusion. The old argument: if you are a good boy, God will help you in the end, no matter what are the obstacles you must face. As a social reflection, the movie is revolting. The moral of the story clearly is: only poor people are truly happy. So, if rich countries keep India, Africa or Brazil in poverty, they are doing us a favor, since they are helping us either being happy or going to heaven. And I could not avoid saying Boyle's movie sounded to me like a bad taste fairy tale version of Fernando Meirelles' masterpiece Cidade de Deus (City of God). 3/10",Slumdog Millionaire
830,AleksanderX,Great movie.,9,27 February 2011,"I think this movie is superb. It totally draw my attention. I watched most of the movies from IMDb top 250 list and this movies totally deserves this ratio. Some are envy and so they say its overrated, but they are wrong. Story is great, interesting from start to finish. Movie is shoot well, biography is well written. Other countries can make great movies.Camera work is great, there are some elements of action and story also portrays difficult life of some young children in India. The biggest factor in my jugment was that movie was constantly draving my interest and attention, what is rare.I give it 9 out of 10.",Slumdog Millionaire
831,scarface_corleone70,Average...at the most.,1,31 December 2011,"First of all, I have no idea what the hue and cry is about. This film is average at most. The acting is mediocre, the story is decent. That's about it. The only creative and exciting part of the film was the ""Who wants to be a millionaire"" show. Apart from that, i must say that the film was very unrealistic. ( I am saying this because as an Indian, it is disturbing to hear people say that this is how India exactly is, and this is how it is in real life). Secondly, the direction was decent. Nothing spectacular. Some of the scenes like the Jai Ho dance in the end was a very good attempt at copying some of the commercial Bollywood films, which, consequently, are horrible. The only thing which made this film do well in the box office, and win an Oscar is due to the ""Indian Stereotype"" and the hype surrounding it.5/10 at the most.",Slumdog Millionaire
832,in_cog_nito,one of the worst to get an academy award,1,29 July 2012,"This movie is an insult to the viewer's intelligence.I saw this before the Oscar hype and seriously I found it insulting in so many ways.The movie's name reeks of colonial overtures. Seriously is it so tough to find a name which isn't downright insulting? While I agree Hindu-Muslim riots are a reality in India what I found to be utterly derogating was a kid of 6-7 yrs portraying Ram with a bow and arrow with a menacing eyes ready to pounce upon younger version of Jamaal.Even more so as the movie portrays somewhat a contemporary (early 1990s) event which is quite well-documented.Slums are also a hard reality not just in Mumbai but throughout the whole of India. But even there people exist who help each other, share whatever meager things they have with others etc. even though here portrayed as some dystopia where all they do is blind the kids, run brothels etc.More than the socio-political portrayal this movie takes all the negative things that has ever happened to anyone in India and make it happen to one single person by which it takes poetic license a bit too far and also tests the very premise of probability theory.ARR has done far more ear-pleasing compositions than what he has done for this stupid movie.While I can write a research paper dissecting all the plot holes each one of them larger than the rings of Saturn I won't do it as it's already been done by so many people.And lo!! behold!! we have 8 Academy awards to show while The Dark Knight and The Wrestler doesn't even get a nomination in many of the relevant categories :(",Slumdog Millionaire
833,som-sougata,Definitely overrated,2,12 September 2011,"Slumdog Millionaire is visually dazzling in spite of showing some of the filthiest possible locales. The soundtrack by A. R. Rahman, though nothing special to Indian audiences, is vastly different from the typical Hollywood fare. The story of two brothers, growing up under similar circumstances but making very different choices and ending up at very different places, is interesting. If you haven't seen it, go see it. The rest of the review contains what might be considered spoilers.In the opening scene of the movie, we find a young man of limited education, Jamal Malik, being tortured by cops in their attempt to squeeze a confession out of him. His crime? - he is one step away from winning the maximum prize money in the popular television quiz show Kaun Banega Crorepati (or Who Wants to be a Millionaire), a feat that the police is convinced he could not have accomplished without cheating. Jamal doesn't confess. Instead he takes us through a whirlwind tour of his life, each episode explaining how he knew the answer to each of the questions he was asked in the show.Or that's what the film-makers would have us believe. How having heard a friend sing a certain song could enable someone to also figure out who wrote that song (the ""correct"" answer to which is incidentally incorrect) or how the knowledge that a certain kind of revolver has ""Colt"" as part of its name could enable him to figure out that a Mr.Colt and not a Mr.Revolver invented the revolver are things that neither the cop nor the viewer is allowed to ask. Perhaps the viewer is also not allowed to ask how some slum-children could trespass into airport runways to play cricket (no security? no walls and barb-wired fences? why would they want to do that anyway? was there no other place to play?), or why a cop would chase these little trouble-makers not only out of the airport but all the way to their homes, or whether anyone would ever jump into a pile of you-know-what, or why hardened criminals would depend on beggars for their source of income instead of the usual murder, extortion, drugs, prostitution, illegal arms and smuggling, or why a prostitute would resent living comfortably as a rich gangster's girlfriend, or why no one panics or shouts or calls the police or even notices when several gangsters chase a woman through a busy railway station in broad daylight openly flaunting their guns and knives until they finally drag her into a car and drive away. There's a scene where a rope is tied to a boy's ankle and another boy holds the other end of the rope while standing on the roof of a moving train and lowers the first boy upside-down so he can steal food from the window. Now, why would anyone attempt this Mission Impossible inspired stunt when they can simply walk past the window when the train is stopping at a station and achieve the same result?The less I say about the difficulty of the questions asked the better. Living in India and not knowing who Amitabh Bachchan is, is like living in America and not knowing who Michael Jackson is. Asking an Indian what the Hindu God Ram has in His hand is like asking an American how Jesus died. Never mind the fact that if he didn't know how Ram looked, he couldn't have figured out he was looking at Ram when he saw a boy painted blue. And the final question? Oh, please! Any 8-year-old would know the answer to that one! And why was the show telecast live again? Every time someone won the maximum amount in the real Kaun Banega Crorepati in India, it was in the news and the promos days before the show was telecast. So it's common knowledge that these shows are not shown live. The real host of KBC, Mr.Amitabh Bachchan also never makes fun of the contestants and goes out of the way to make them feel comfortable.Nevertheless, I can understand why the movie was so popular. At a time when financial markets were crashing and people were losing their jobs, Slumdog gave people hope. It told them to stop thinking with their heads and believe in their hearts that by some miraculous turn of events, everything will be alright.",Slumdog Millionaire
834,carda1,"Run, don't walk to see this film",10,11 September 2008,"This film is bound to be a classic like Cinema Paradiso, Rocky or any number of films that celebrate the underdog. Sure it's manipulative, but tell me which great film isn't. The audience is rooting for Jamal, the young protagonist, from the first frame to the final fade out. Simon Beaufoy's marvelously inventive screenplay, plus Danny Boyle's exceptional direction should make this a hit, in spite of the fact that there are no known actors (at least known in N. America) and chunks of the dialogue are in Hindi. It is a crowd pleaser in the best sense of the term.Note to Fox Searchlight: If you market this properly, you could have another Little Miss Sunshine or Juno on your hands. Frankly, this is a superior film to either of those.",Slumdog Millionaire

His trademark shots are all there, his excellent transitions, masterful score, and compelling character's that connect to the very end. I'm a fan of Darjeeling Limited and the India aesthetic in general, but this film is relentless in its depiction of the gritty slums that surround it. The unknown cast only adds to the realism, no parallels can be drawn to previous works.I'm not of a fan of spoiling anything in reviews, it peeves me when more often than not I read a review and nearly most of the film is compressed into three paragraphs. I'm not going to do that. I will say that the film is promising and should court some Oscar buzz this year. However, not in the common ""little Indie that could"" fashion, this film goes beyond that.It has so many things going against it here in the States, the usage of south Asian characters, and... well I'll stop there.

The settings were ideally suited for each act and the ever changing story drawn together by an overall story arc was simply breathtaking. The acting was top notch to the point I was happy to watch the credits, which for me is rather rare. I could go on and on as to the good in this film, but I encourage anyone reading this to see it for themselves...this is one movie, film, work of art that is worth more than the price of admission.

Some parts were touching, others striking in their social commentary. The cinematography was excellent; even with a non-linear plot, our perspective was never lost and the transitions were never jarring.I have to laugh at myself. I never watch TV, and never watch shows like ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire,"" but I was on the edge of my seat half the time. I think it's because the characters were so well developed, I cared about the outcomes. And because the characters were so plausible, I felt like the events in the movie weren't just determining the fate of these few people, but were giving a voice to the millions who lead similar lives.I recommend everyone see it. Let yourself relive the process of growing up, when you have to learn some hard realities of life and determine which of your youthful beliefs are worth preserving.(And, just in case that was too touchy feely, let me make it clear: there is something in this movie for everyone. It is entertainment at its finest. Exciting, mesmerizing, and meaningful.)",Slumdog Millionaire

What I got was a fast paced drama about growing up and trying to survive in the slums of India. I very much enjoyed it; the acting and direction was of a high calibre and despite the rather overdone & odd ending, I have no complaints. But to give it as many Oscars as Gone With the Wind is verging on Blasphemy! I mean, the ending was your usual feel-good romp, with the brother of the main character filling a tub with money then getting shot in it, before shouting ""god is great!"" (don't ask), then straight after we get an impromptu dance sequence for the credits, which was rather stupid.My second point is that it's a movie dressed as a film.

847,takethecab,Everyone involved in this production should be very proud...,9,22 December 2008,"I just watched this yesterday with a friend and we were both baffled with just how amazing it was. This is one of those rare movies that inspires you. It follows the life of Jamal, his brother Salim and Jamal's true love Latika. All of these characters have suffered in their childhood and the movie shows how their troubles extend into their adult lives. It is a movie about survival, of love, of family and of fate. I thought the setting in India was very appropriate and moving- a lot of these issues are reality for many people- and I applaud Danny Boyle for bringing light to them. Slumdog Millionaire shows us how goodness can triumph and, at the expense of sounding clichéd, gives hope. Go see it, it will make you feel a mixture of sadness and happiness and you will not be bored for a second.",Slumdog Millionaire
848,Rachelleduc85,I give it a 10 and I'll tell you why,10,28 March 2015,"Most people summarize the plot. I'm not doing that. I saw this in theaters and just watched it again tonight. I don't understand any of the complaints I have read about it being overrated. It is about Destiny. Everything that has happened in Jamal's life has lead up to him winning Millionaire to create a better life for himself and Latika to be together happily. That is why there are so many ""coincidences"" Salim is the most complex, well developed character. His death in the end was so symbolic. He died surrounded by what he cared about the most. Money. He earned money in such a corrupt way and at the expense of his brother and Latika's happiness. How ironic the exact moment he gets gunned down is the moment Jamal wins millionaire and most likely the same amount of money that is in the tub. We know Salim is religious because we see him saying prayers, at the end he says ""God is Great"" I believe he says this because he is aware of the wrong he has done and knows that he got everybody into this mess, now Jamal and Latika can live happily ever after. I believe deep down Salim was a bit jealous of Jamal because he still had a heart. Salim never wanted Latika around and kind of used her as ammo; I believe, to get back at her and Jamal. Despite Salim being older, Jamal never listened to him. All that happened was Salim's way of gaining some sort of power. He then too realized the ""written destiny"" by the end and just let go and left it in God's hands. He was overall a scumbag but had a few redeeming moments. I think there is just so much more to this storyline than what people are saying about it being cliché and guessing what would happen. In the beginning we know what is written so of course we can already guess that Jamal will win the money and the girl. But how does that happen? How does that journey twist and turn when it seems like all odds are against him? That is the real plot line.",Slumdog Millionaire
849,user-26-905621,From slum dog to everlasting love in 10 questions,9,16 April 2015,"Slumdog millionaire is a brilliant movie about Jamal Malik who has won the TV-show: Who wants to be a millionaire! Jamal grew up in the slums of India and was given a chance to participate to the show. When Jamal leaves the studio, he is arrested for cheating. He is then tortured by the Indian police, to reveal his secret. After a while, Jamal gets a chance to explain why he knew the answers and why he participated in the first place. This reason is Latika, a girl Jamal loves. However Latika is taken away and Jamal wants to find her back by participating, because she enjoys the show. In the quiz Jamal takes us on a journey through his life, explaining for every question, how he knew the answer to the question and showing us what an impact Latika had in his life. This movie is brilliantly shot and is directed in a way, I have never seen before.Especially the way in how the story of Slumdog Millionaire is told, is impressive. Instead of following a standard chronological format, this movie is full of flashbacks. The flashbacks even take up more time of the movie than the main storyline, which makes the movie interesting to watch to. Also, the movie shows you a complete opposite side of the TV-show and the host. On camera he seems nice and friendly, however, off camera he wants Jamal to lose. In addition to this, in the movie you see a side of India that is not about the wealth of the country. Instead, it is showing you how poor the country is and how hard the life of the people in the slums is. This in comparison to the TV- show where Jamal won 20 million rupees is an huge contrast, which gives you the feeling Jamal doesn't belong there.One of the most spectacular aspects of the movie was its editing. The way in which the scenes went from his childhood memories to the TV- show was magnificent. The transitions are made, so that you want to watch further and learn more about how Jamal grew up. The use of colour in the movie is also powerful. It is one of the aspects which makes the movie so strong. Jamal tries to find a girl, Latika in the movie. When they meet Latika is always wearing some piece of yellow clothing, which symbolizes the hope and positivity of Latika. Furthermore, yellow is tone of the most outstanding colours in the slums. It is easy to pick someone out of a crowd in the slums of India, if he or she is wearing yellow, which was also an important factor in choosing the colour yellow.So overall, this movie was I think this movie was a wonderful production of the directors of Slumdog Millionaire. The techniques that were used to create were spot-on and executed perfectly. It isn't without a reason that this movie has won eight Oscars and many other noteworthy prices. This movie is one of the classics and everyone who loves to see a love story should certainly see this movie as it is about Jamal trying to do everything he can to find back Latika. So if you are not lucky enough to win your own lottery, then at least watch someone else win one and enjoy the great story that comes with it.",Slumdog Millionaire
850,saratdasisback,"If you can neglect a few faults, it is gritty and dramatic",6,20 August 2014,"Yes it won Oscars. It was special because of the international crew working on it. As a movie (in spite of Best Motion Picture Oscar), I beg to differ. The storyline is typical of many Hindi films.The storytelling style was good and so was the acting... except the funny situation where the children abruptly switch wholly to English once they are teens. In a normal middle class society, education happens in stages. And the society shown there is of the class that normally does not get that many privileges. If we take too long to learn to speak fluently through a well-funded scholastic association; then it is baffling how it takes much less for the kids in here to switch tongues completely.Bear in mind, they were peddling, hawking, stealing and living off the land. As a tour guide, OK; but even among your friends, ALWAYS, this is silly. There are 2 strong reasons why the Hindi dubbed edition was more successful in India than the original - 1. a large section of the populace had problem with the English language. 2. a section of the populace who had no problem with either Hindi or English could identify and empathise more with the characters when they spoke in Hindi just because the alternative sounded unnatural for the context.Other than this major grudge and the sexualisation of the song 'Jai Ho' by PCD, WHICH DID GOD KNOWS WHAT WITHE ORIGINAL MEANING OF THE SONG... and A.R.Rahman's best work in that year being Jodhaa Akbar, which is miles ahead in music than SM ( but it was a wholly Indian film ) the movie is OK",Slumdog Millionaire

From the weak Quiz show questions, to the child who doesn't vomit when drenched in feces, to the depiction of gang life in India. This movie isn't just fiction, it's absurd fantasy. The love story is about as believable as a Saturday morning cartoon. That anyone should walk away from this film believing it's decent film is itself a tragedy.

He appears on the show solely to find the love of his life, Latika, whom he met a very young age, but circumstances and his ambiguous brother, Salim have kept them apart.This film has lots of fun parts, but also lots of tense drama and suspense actually with a brilliant concept of using flashbacks to show their affect on his chances on the TV show.I walked in knowing nothing about this film, but was blown away by the end.

It is gritty, in your face and at time tough to watch. It defies normal Hollywood visuals as it does bother dressing to make the image favorable. India is photographed raw and dirty so breathtaking. It's almost a Monet painted with the waste. I will not speak to the plot points as it must unravel to you as it did for me. This movie needs nationwide release. If it is near you, GO SEE IT NOW.

That's not to say the film is always light-hearted, far from it in places, but we do focus on a young lad from India's slums who goes on to become a millionaire. Not too original in a 'rags to riches' sense you might think but rest assured the film goes deeper than that. The key to his success is in his past and a child's life is not easy in poor India. Yet it is companionship that shines through, with the two young boys (slumdog and his older brother) providing the movie with its many warming laughs and the eventual truth that the real prize is not money.

It doesn't take long to figure out the characters. It makes complicated emotions and lives too simplistic.When I left the movie theater I didn't think ""Man, life is hard for some people in India.""

How could it be that they simply don't conceive the possibility that a low caste guy could become successful. he has to be prevented of doing so, and punished.Instead of exploring this sad and terrible aspect of Indian culture, and produce a deeper reflection about it, Boyle turned the movie into a cliché love history. what a waste.",Slumdog Millionaire

It was filmed fairly well and the story is very inspirational and touching, but compare it to films like ""It's A Wonderful Life"" which barely received any attention in its day and you may possibly catch my drift. I will tip my hat to the people behind the film for painting a vivid picture of two brothers in the slums of India, though. This film would probably have made a larger impact on me if it hadn't dominated the Oscars this year. ""Milk"" or ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" were more applicable for the big prize, in my opinion.

871,birsanionutfv,Slumdog Millionaire Review,1,19 February 2021,"""Slumdog Millionaire"" is a drama movie directed by Danny Boyle and is based on the book named ""Q&A"" created by Vikas Swarup. The main actors are Dev Patel starring as Jamal Malik and Freida Pinto starring as Latika.
The story isn't that interesting, just the fact that it shows us a side of indian culture we don't quite often see. The movie starts in a poor village, Dharavi, where some kids were taken and were taught to sing for begging. Two of them, Jamal and, his brother, Salim, escaped and took the train to go away from there. They managed to live by doing illegal things, but Salim got mad on Jamal and they got apart. Later, Jamal decided to go to the show ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" and he had luck because all questions were based on his past but we will see if he'll win and if he'll meet his love.
The story was not that good but the acting was quite nice and the characters felt pretty lively.

The only movie that's better than this is ""Salaam Bombay"" (Ironic that they are both about Bombay).Rahman's music is incredible and yes he has done some other amazing movies like ""Dil Se"" but it's like comparing Apples to Oranges they are just not the same. In fact some of his early stuff in Tamil is way better than anything else but again its not the same context.The direction of this movie , the candid way it's portrayed is just great. The scene when the little guy is getting kicked by the driver because the tires of the merc are stolen and the American who pays him 100$ shows you how different it is in India. It's the way it is. Most Indians like to ignore it this one accepts and appreciates a foreign director portraying it as it should be. My only beef with this movie is the acting of Anil Kapoor (the condescending who wants to be a Millionaire guy). Ridiculous. Amithabh would have been so good for this role.If you are Indian watch this movie for what is and don't compare it with some entertainment flick. It shows everything India is. The good and the bad. If you are not then watch this movie for what life is like on the other side of the world - beautiful but full of challenges, not so different from what we go through in the western world.",Slumdog Millionaire

Danny Boyle, the director of this film, has managed to present a drama combined with a love story. Released in 2008, it has won 8 Oscars. Dev Patel, Freida Pinto and Anil Kapoor are just some of the actors that have played in this amazing movie.
The main concept of this film is a game show called ,,Who wants to be a millionaire"". From being a simple assistant to being part of a reality show, Jamal experienced a lot of feelings. In the first scene we saw Jamal being tortured. Later on, we started to discover a lot of things. As we were introduced more and more in the story, we had more questions about it.
In my view, the main idea of this film is more than awesome. I was amazed when I realised that the life that the director caught in his lens is real. He presented very well the miserable life in Dharavi.

880,rimermina,Slumdog Millionaire Review,5,19 February 2021,"""Slumdog Millionaire "" is a romance-drama movie that came out in 2008 and has won a total of 119 awards. Directed by Danny Boyle and starring actors like Dev Patel, the movie has won the Oscar for the best soundtrack and the best cinematography, among many others.
The movie is based on the book ""Q&A"" and it places Jamal Malik in the spotlight. Jamal decides to go on the show ""Who wants to be a millionaire?"" in hopes that his sweetheart, Latika, is going to be watching the show and they might get reunited with each other. The path to winning the big prize is not an easy one, but Jamal is helped by his incredible memory and his terrifying childhood, managing to get much further than anyone expected.
Talking about filmmaking, the acting wasn't spectacular, fairly poor, to be honest, but the costumes and the soundtrack were spot on. Recreating the Indian culture can be hard, but they handled it successfully.
The one thing I appreciated the most about this cinematic piece is the fact that it brings awareness to the horrible living conditions in India. It shows the way some people have it good, while others struggle to keep a roof over their head.
In conclusion, the movie doesn't make it to the top of the list for me, but I can definitely see how some people would enjoy it. In case you like unique love stories, this movie is for you.",Slumdog Millionaire

Children in India did not have a very beautiful childhood, they were abused, beaten, even blinded. Young Jamal got rid of these difficulties quite easily, but with the help of what happened around him, he managed to answer the questions to the ""Who wants to be a millionaire"" contest.
The costume of the Indian children looks very similar to the real one, but the clothes of the people from the company where Jamal is a kind of waiter, look very good and are chosen with taste. What I didn't like were the dark frames and dark clothes of the people on the street.

Other mentionable actors that played their part in the movie are Freida Pinto(Latika) ,Irrfan khan ( the inspector) and probably the best performer ,Anill Kapoor( Prem).
The film tells the story of Jamal Malik, an 18-year-old orphan who came straight from the Mumbai slum and is about to face the most important day of his life. Jamal has to answer one more question to win the fabulous sum of 20 million rupees, in the Indian version of the show ""Do you want to be a millionaire?"". Unfortunately, when the filming of the show is interruppted , the police arrests Jamal on suspicion of cheating. Desperate to prove his innocence, Jamal tells them the story of his life in the slum, where he grew up with his brother, all the adventures they went through, even the unhappy encounters with local mobsters.
Unfortunately , this movie fails at anything except being a drama that has nothing to do with the actual reality of living in India.Being directed by an englishman , this movie refuses to state the specific political and historical factors and events that left India in the dire state that it is , even to this day. Tryng to be appeasfull to all the comunities , this dull movie focuses only on the situation of indian comunities , completely evoiding the causes(Indian culture never wanted progress and refused to abandon the incredibly absurd traditions and religion, provoking the english and causing a revolution).
So, in my humble opinion , this muvie is an utter catastrophe, proving that , still, after almost 80 years from the Indian revolution , England and India cant produce anithing remarkable toghether.

You might ask why is Jamal suspected of cheating and it turns out that while participating at Kaun Banega Crorepati Jamal had the right answer at every occasion. Due to his background and his lack of confidence they believed he is just another nobody from the slums and decided to take his opportunity to win and find out how can he beat the system. So after being tortured Jamal is forced to recounts the incidents in his life that provided him with each individual answer. Soon we learn that he had a toughf life since his childhood, the only two proeminent figures in his life being his brother Salim, and a girl from the slums Latika, which will become later his love interest. Jamal presents how they were raised to be beggars and after learning that the children are blinded to become more effective at begging they try to escape but in the process Latika is left behind. Growing up Jamal tries to find Latika but when he finaly meets her again he learns that they can not be in love. Jamal tells her that everyday he will wait at a station for her to come but in a final attemp to reach her he participates at Kaun Banega Crorepati knowing that she watches the show.What I believe makes SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE so great is the fact that Danny Boyle, with a fluent direction brought a Bollywood style movie to the western part of the world. It is something that you do not watch everyday, although it was quite popular in Romania during the communist era. The sharp editing and the amazing script written by Simon Beaufoy are also something that I want to single out because are done in such an effective way that together help SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE to stand out.I really enjoyed the movie and I would happily recommended to anybody to watch it because it is an amazing story and a really good example of overcoming the difficulties of life.",Slumdog Millionaire

The film is motivational but also romantic, it is directed by Danny Boyle and Loveleen Tandan, and the screenplay is written by Simon Beaufoy.
The slumdog millionaire is a film that shows the life of a boy named Jamal. He and his brother Tito lived in India and had a poor financial situation. After their city was attacked, Jamal, his brother and a girl named Latika manage to escape and flee, being found by a man and taken to a children's home. But this home turned out not to be what it seems, because the children were begged and tortured, in order to raise as much money as possible when they are sent to the streets. When it was Jamal's turn to be tormented, Tito manages to save him, but leaves Latika behind, unfortunately when Jamal falls in love with her. After a few years of walking the streets and robbing, Jamal was still thinking about his love and planning to find it. But as bad luck in Easter on this Indian kid, the moment he finds her face, his brother who had become a murderer, threatens him to go away and leave him with latika. He listened and left. But when they grow up, Jamal is hired as a waiter at a telephone office, and in the end he has the opportunity to look for his brother's number and has the Luck to Find him.
When it comes to this film, it seems to me that it is one with a very goood one. I personally liked the story and the message that this film wants to convey. The fact that the boy named Jamal went through so many things and everything he wanted was to find Latika, he shows me that there are people in the world who see true love.

They get through the bad experiences together and Jamal manages to keep fighting no matter what.In my opinion the movie was not that good but not that bad, it was right in the middle, but i can say that i really liked the soundtrack and the acting, especially how the life in India was portrayed and the love story between Jamal and Latika.Overall i wouldn't really recommend this movie to people who don't like the drama genre, but you could give it a try anyways, you have nothing to lose.",Slumdog Millionaire

Jamal attempt to reach Latika, he decides tp become a contenstnt on the indian version of ""Who wants to be a millionaire?"", because he knows she watches the show regulary.
I really liked the costumes of the characters, it helped them get better into the character and show exactely what they meant. The soundtrack was very good, especially since I recognized a song that was in the scene where they were stealing food fro, people on the train.
It was a good movie, it's not to my taste, but I liked watching it, especially since I haven't seen many Indian movies.
I recommend this film to those who like drama, especially to those who like the show ""Who wants to be a millionaire?'.",Slumdog Millionaire

They want to show us the poverty conditions and then, in some parts they show us how those children enjoy little things. It is observed how children are beated and abused in India. The movie is related on Jamal's life and his experience with the game. The questions of the game remind him of his memories as a ""slumdog"". Those memories help him to find the answers to the questions.
I didn't like Salim's costume design and the dark frames.
For me it was a little bit boring, I couldn't find the interesting part that captures me, but instead I really like the love story between Latika and Jamal. This is not my type of movies, so I don't recomand this to you.",Slumdog Millionaire

With the help of his memories he answers all the questions correctly and his tale involves crime, a lot of drama and also romance when he falls in love with Latika.
What I liked about the film was the way the actors played and the moments when certain very poor areas of India were presented and the lifestyle that the children there approached, showing exactly the reality.
It seemed to me a very interesting film, full of action and suspense, showing sad but also happy moments. It is an ideal film for drama lovers and for those who want to discover the sad stories of young people who did not have an education.

The film starts by showing the poverty in India. The way that it does this is in a humorous but serious way and therefore still getting the point across. The film then goes onto show how the poor and rich are living together; side by side and how there is a large divide between classes. Two Brothers Jamal Malik and Salim Malik are taken in by the bad guy who forces the children to beg so that he makes money. They escape from this bad guy leaving behind them there friend Latika). After living rough the brothers manage to find Latika but they then become separated. Jamal ends up working in a call centre as a tea boy and this is how he locates his brother. He then knows that if he gets onto ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"" Latika will see him.
The movie was well made in terms of music actors and filming . It should the poverty the people of India are leaving in and how nobody cares not even the police , thru their well build story and heartbreaking scenery . I would also like to add that dough the film was structured quite nicely when it came to organizing the panels for Jammals backstory and actual story it got confusing because of the main story being interrupted by the back story every 3 min or so and sometimes it was hard to distinguish who was who .
In the end the story is an eye opening one it wasn't made to be fun but quite the opposite that's why I didn't enjoy the film but if you like a Serious drama films then I think youll like this one",Slumdog Millionaire

He is accused of fraud after having reached the last round of the popular TV show ""Who wants to be a millionaire?"" How can an uneducated young man from the Dharavi slum in Mumbai succeed in a quiz show, when even university professors failed? ""I knew the answers"", says Jamal, and no, he is not a genius. During his interrogation Jamal recounts, through flashbacks, the circumstances that led him to identifying the answers correctly. The story he tells is the story of his life.
Jamal grew up as a street kid in the Dharavi slum of Mumbai. His earliest memories are of kids playing on Mumbai's streets and being chased by the police. Later he remembers the day when his brother Salim locked him in the outhouse while Bollywood legend Amitabh Bachchan was visiting Dharavi. In order to get himself out and ask the famous actor for an autograph, Jamal jumps into the stinking sewer. When Hindi and Muslims clash violently in the Bombay riots, Jamals mother is killed and Jamal and his brother Salim have to flee the city. During their escape they meet the ""third musketeer"", Latika, a young girl who is alone on the streets as well. The children stick together and later fall into the hands of Maman, a ruthless gangster who picks up orphans and sends them to beg in the street. To increase business he teaches them to sing, sends them begging with a baby in their arms, and even blinds them. When they realize what is going to happen to them, Jamal and Salim escape from Maman, but Latika is left behind. While Salim believes that Jamal should ""move on"".In my opinion the movie it's decent. A decent story with decent acors and decent costumes.

913,deyanedeyan,A really good movie,8,24 February 2021,"Slumdog MillionaireA romance, drama and action movie about Jamal Malik played by Dev Patel and his brother Salim Malik played by Madhur Mittal. I liked this film even though action and drama are not really my type. The story was good for a movie that was made in 2008. The movie is directed by Danny Boyle, can't say much about him, it's the first movie I watched from him.
It all starts in Mumbai when the two brothers lost their mom and have to go on their own. After that they go on with a girl named Latika, she is a very important character in the story. The story continues with a man interested in ""business"" with kids who ask for money in the streets. They got rid of them. The main action that causes everything to happen is that Salim got in a hood and threw away his brother just to be alone with Latika. Here romance and drama got together and our main character is put in the main plan of the story. In the next scenes Jamal is a worker at a calling company and searches for his brother and Latika. Another sad thing happens to Jamal when he finds them but they reject him. Now our main character wants to get the attention of his lost buddies so he went to ""Do you want to become a millionaire?"" where he gets accused of cheating and then the story actually starts. I'm not going to spoil it.
I really liked the story and how the characters are built. Jamal was a good character with a good story. The argument with his brother was a bit cliche, but it's a 2008 movie. I also liked the costumes, they were very accrued. The scenes from the beginning are good too, it is giving a strong feeling when you see everything that happens and all those barefoot kids. I also liked the scenes filmed at Taj Mahal, I liked the perspective and the effects that suggested hot weather.
Overall this movie is good, even though I'm not a fan of action movies, the story and the characters are good. At first sight the movie looks cheap, but that's only because it's 12 year old. There is nothing cheap in this movie. I recommend it and I'm going to give 8 out of 10 stars.",Slumdog Millionaire

915,rock_u70000,Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!,10,10 January 2009,"As someone who has seen Mumbai turn from 'The City of Gold' to 'The City of Muck,' this movie encapsulated the despair and desperation of Dharavi in a manner so gritty it was scary. It cut terrifyingly close to the bone as it took us straight into the innards of this brutal world, where wide-eyed kids lose their innocence (and their eyes) at the hands of ruthless gangsters who mutilate, maim, kidnap and kill at will. And the first thought that came to mind is that it has taken an 'outsider' (Danny Boyle), to go fearlessly into 'No Man's Land' and hold up a mirror to our sordid society  the same one that looks the other way... and flinches when confronted. It also makes one wonder why some of our entirely overrated, desi directors (homegrown products, at that), have failed so spectacularly in spelling out the ugly truth about Mumbai's dark world as transparently and convincingly? Whether or not Boyle's film wins an Oscar or two is immaterial. It should be made compulsory viewing for anybody who wants to understand the shocking, ghastly subtext that deals with the 'other' Mumbai  the one that feeds on abject poverty and paradoxically enough, also on the soaring hope that this same poverty breeds success. But Slumdog... is Boyle's gift to Mumbai. He has unblinkingly shown us the rather hideous face of this devastated metropolis that still remains the magnet for the rest of India, despite its faultlines.",Slumdog Millionaire

917,harshani,Disappointing and morally offensive,3,5 November 2009,"This is a ridiculous farce and western celebration of a mediocre film. It's novelty (being of 'Indian' (Bollywood) origin) is the real source of the hype. If you have seen the greats (eg Pakeezah), Slum is an insult. This movie is not 'Indian' or 'Asian'. It is ABOUT Indian people, designed for mass (unthinking) consumption. And it hit the jackpot, proving timing is everything.The West (especially America) is frantic and hungry to embrace other cultures it never cared much for before. Ironically, as new Super Powers (India included) are emerging economic forces to reckon with, their cultures (whoever/whatever may 'represent' them) are frantically grabbed as they pass by, and hailed as ""awesome"", ""wonderful"", ""great"".Puhlease...Though she is not in it, think of one movie Ashwarya Rai (the biggest Bollywood transport) has been in that was above mediocre. Don't think too hard -- there is none. Yet she is applauded/worshipped every corner she goes. She cannot act, she can look into the camera and...nothing. It's like Angelina Jolie without any acting skills.One can't help but feel some embarrassment for the 'crew' of 'The Slums' as there is no doubt they are shocked by the response. They must be. Sure they must be proud too. But I see it in their faces when interviewed. They must know the movie was simply not that great. Whatever positive response/recognition was given, it was not because of the quality of the movie.With no capacity for 'staying power' or lasting impression, a 3/10 is being very generous for this slummer. The colours were pretty.For anyone who loves this movie (and I know there are many)...the challenge is to remove the exotic 'brown people' and leave the story as is... Is this still a great movie? Worthy of even a mention at the Oscars?? Puhlease.",Slumdog Millionaire

I am a fan of Trainspotting, and absolutely loved 28 Days Later. What I got here was something nothing like either of these movies, but something else, wholly beautiful.From beginning until the very end, I was enthralled in this film. Everything in this movie has a purpose, whether it be to give the characters their human qualities, or to be used for plot later on. Usually with films like this, I have found, you find somewhat of a filler section (which is why I have never been really a fan of these genres) ... but here, here was something very special.I felt with the main character, through everything in his life, and that everything in the entire film is bringing him to the conclusion of this film. I sat and experienced the things he had gone through, and was genuinely moved as it came to conclusion.Beautifully written, shot and acted, I feel I am compelled to tell people the virtues of this movie.

924,ravi ravinder,Saw this Movie the day after the hostage taking,9,27 November 2008,"First of all, a story line that is overblown like much of Salman Rushdie's work (also a native of Mumbai), but firmly rooted in reality. Excitingly shot in widescreen with sound (and music to match); not following the book in every detail, but nevertheless riveting, confronting, often amoral, and for those unfamiliar with Mumbai one hell of an introduction. Dev Patel - who would have thought the eager, immature character from Skins could turn up with a portrayal like this.I saw this movie at a preview as the Taj-Oberoi hostage crisis was evolving. In a sense, the two narratives intersect, but only marginally. But the back story is the same - Indian Muslims (and not all of them are poor, downtrodden and denied opportunity), sensing the hopelessness of their fate, carry with them the additional 'stigma' of being Muslim in a Hindu majority country. They may then turn to crime (as in the movie) or into terrorism (as in the events of Nov 27 onwards). Simplistic? Perhaps. But Slumdog Millionaire will get you closer to understanding, albeit tangentially, why Mumbai has been struck by terrorism so often in the last 15 years. Ahh, Mumbai..

Thought I will attempt to answer some questions by user/author ""wildsecks"" on the previous page ..Q) How did this kid learn to speak English so well when he lived in the slums of India and never learned to read? A) The kid was attending school before his mother died in riotsQ)What happened to all of the questions between 16000 and 1000000? Since when is Millionaire a live show? A)It was movie, we are not saying the movie is based on actual events. Q)How did they all go from dark ugly kids to light studs at such a late age? A) They have learnt the art of living, made money, grown up and now they know how to clean their bodies ..Q)How did they all learn English? A)The movie is meant to target the west(obviously for commercial reasons), the English speaking audience. Once the viewers mind is set that the show is set in India, it doesn't really matter, that they have to speak Hindi. (Most illiterates in most cities(in India) do understand English and do speak English if not perfect)Q)How did the girl learn how to drive with an abusive husband? A)The point is she has to escape, the car was given to her, for her to leave the mobile phone in the car. Also the point is Jamaal, who is about to get the millions is still thinking about her. They wanted to build some tension for the viewers, for the money we paid :) Q)Why did the brother want to die in a bathtub of money rather than escaping himself? A) the gangster who had miserable life as child, he found dignity in dying in a pool of money, his achievement. Q)How did the main character even find the chick in the mansion (why was he even following his brother?)? A) he was following his brother, coz he believed Latika is not gone, even though his brother tried to save his embarrassment for keepign her It was all about how we feel about each other .. Q)The second time he came banging on the mansion doors, what was his actual plan if someone had answered the door? I'm supposed to believe this is a smart kid? A) May be this was 10th attempt, each at different part of the day, with different secuirty personnel in their shift. Q)Did I mention how did they learn English? How were they able to give tours of the Taj Mahal? How many shoes could they possibly have sold?A)I know some people who are illiterates, but do speak good English. One can speak language by getting used to it .. though one cannot writeQ)Since when do people tip with $100 bills, and this AFTER the people themselves have been robbed? A)The kid was winning .. he wanted to snap his host .. for making fun of him that if he has even seen a dollar bill .. again mumbai/delhi in a global village, the dollar is no rarity .. Q)Why did Amitabh Bachan play himself, but Anil Kapoor didn't? Why was the host such an ass to begin with? A)The 'amitabh' at the helicopter is not the actual Amitabh, but his look alike. The host envied the success of the boy, coz the host himself took, 30/40 years to succeed and become a millionaire.When the boy was winning, he could not believe that it can be so easy .. then he suspects .. lays a trap ..

It is one of the most interesting stories portrayed on the big screen that I have ever seen before. The interweaving of all the different plots is outstanding. This is a true love story & rag to riches story. I can't wait to read the book. It is exciting, heart-warming, and heart-wrenching, all in one. It keeps you on the edge and wanting to see more. Not to mention how involved one can become in cheering for the characters. It is a ""must see!"" It is made by a westerner, therefore, it is not a typical ""bollywood movie"" at all. It has just enough ""bollywood"" in it to provide an excellent ending. Go see it!",Slumdog Millionaire

It is a brilliant film, the music was especially surprising given I have seen several Bollywood films and usually dislike the music. I have read comments on this board like ""This film feeds into the Western mind that all Indians are poor."" Give me a break, all ""the west"" has seen of Mumbia is the incredible growth, a rising standard of living, night clubs..etc, so will those people stand up and say there are no slums like the ones viewed in Slumdog Millionaire?? Of course there are. If you want to see an American film that is pretty harsh on American city standards, you only need to look one place above Slumdog on IMDb top 250. 33. 8.6 Se7en (1995) 220,812 34. 8.6 Slumdog Millionaire (2008) 53,243But the point is THESE ARE MOVIES PEOPLE....it is not a documentary...so lighten up.",Slumdog Millionaire
928,Grantz777,Slumdog Millionaire.. Movie Review,10,28 December 2008,"""Slumdog Millionaire"" .. RStaring: Dev Patel, Irrfan Khan, Anil Kapoor, Freida Pinto, Madhur MittalSlumdog Millionaire, is the story of two grade school age brothers and their little female playmate, left parentless in the streets of Mumbai India. The viewing audience is given a deep and very open look into life in the slums of India. The film is gut wrenching, disturbing and emotionally aching at times. Yet unveils one of the greatest love stories in cinematic history and explores every range and depth of the human heart.The story begins with an angry riot in which Jamal and Salim's mother is killed. The two brothers and a little girl named Latika, are left alone to fight for survival in the slums of the city. Living in make-shift tents at the city dumps and scraping for whatever food can be found amid the rubbage.Eventually the three children are taken captive by an insidious and evil criminal who forces the children to sing and beg for money. Even horrendously removing the eyes of some children, in order to make them more effective beggars.Jamal is no coward, but Salim is a very brave fighter. Eventually the two brothers are able to escape the clutches of the evil enslaver. As Salim bravely facilitates a dangerous and harrowing escape. Latika, however, is not quite fast enough runner, and at the last second is captured. And her rare beauty is subsequently exploited by the captors, hoping to eventually sell her.The two brothers manage to scrape and survive the slums into their late teens. When Salim is drawn into the gangster life, in a mob run by his former captors, who still hold Latika captive. While Jamal turns to working at whatever job he can get. Always vowing to return and rescue Latika. After one failed attempt, which leaves Latika with a knife wound, for the escape plot. Jamal qualifies for India's number one television show. ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"" Hoping that Latika will see him on the show, and somehow they can finally be re-united.Jamal is so good at the history/trivia game that the host becomes jealously enraged. And has Jamal arrested, tortured and questioned all night by the police. From there unveils one of the most redemptive and profound stories of the human heart to ever be told.",Slumdog Millionaire
929,wildsecks,Extremely Disjointed,1,18 January 2009,"Slumdog Millionaire was one of the WORST movies I have ever seen.Talk about disjointed.How did this kid learn to speak English so well when he lived in the slums of India and never learned to read? What happened to all of the questions between 16000 and 1000000? Since when is Millionaire a live show? How did they all go from dark ugly kids to light studs at such a late age? How did they all learn English? How did the girl learn how to drive with an abusive husband? Why did the brother want to die in a bathtub of money rather than escaping himself? How did the main character even find the chick in the mansion (why was he even following his brother?)? The second time he came banging on the mansion doors, what was his actual plan if someone had answered the door? I'm supposed to believe this is a smart kid?Did I mention how did they learn English? How were they able to give tours of the Taj Mahal? How many shoes could they possibly have sold? Since when do people tip with $100 bills, and this AFTER the people themselves have been robbed? Why did Amitabh Bachan play himself, but Anil Kapoor didn't? Why was the host such an ass to begin with? Why are all of the questions laid out in the same exact chronological order as his life?All of the other things wrong with this movie that I won't even bother pointing out.This movie was awful.If I could give a 0, I would.

What I did not say was how skeptical I was myself, for apart from the media frenzy, there was nothing in this movie I was immediately attracted to, the poster didn't really help, and to be honest, it's not exactly my kinda movie.That being said, i have no regret for the 2 hours spent watching it. It kept all my attention from beginning to end, even the credits were a delight to watch. It's refreshing to see a movie that takes you through such a journey of joy, pain, love and much more.. to end in such a touching way that you have a big smile on your face, that you're not even aware of. It is truly a journey of feelings.The actors were great, even the children, the cinematography was incredible, the slums heartbreaking and the love credible. I felt for the main characters right from the beginning. The universality of this movie is perhaps what will make it popular all over the world. I could imagine similar situations back home in Africa, or even here in China. The director was incredible, the music on point, the lighting, and all the visuals were just perfect. It was a delight for the eyes, ears and emotions, I recommend it for anyone.",Slumdog Millionaire

933,gopz,See it twice...or maybe don't..,5,22 February 2009,"I liked the movie. I didn't love it though. But that's just me and my opinion. What I'm really trying to say is when you have a movie that generates this much hype and acclaim, you can be forgiven for thinking that you will eventually end up loving it. But unlike in the movie, the bottomless optimism fails miserably. It's just a fantasy/romance movie with a lot of colors added. And I guess the reason the Americans/British found it so interesting was because of the novel theme. Once the novelty wears off, am sure this film will be remembered only as an overrated average film with some not-so-good acting all around. Don't take my word for it, see it for yourself. But I wont recommend seeing it again. For then, you won't like it even half as you did the first time.And I wonder too, would anyone have paid so much attention to it had it been made completely by Indians?",Slumdog Millionaire
934,was1966,Terribly contrived,4,29 January 2009,"This film left me with one thought, ""So what?""This is a movie without any act of heroism, and simply another movie aimed at trashing the concept of living a purposeful life with goals. It expresses the modern day philosophy that says if you are born in poverty you cannot help yourself other than through luck (winning a game show). Why not tell an inspiring story of a ""slumdog"" becoming a successful businessman, overcoming various obstacles that inevitably come life's way, and developing a parallel story showing how and why he falls in love with the girl of his dreams?The theme of the movie has been misleadingly portrayed as a moral comment on today's global recession and in particular we are shown a character who cares more about the concept of love than money. This is demonstrated in the less than dramatic and completely contrived climax when the lead character attempts the final question knowing he does not know the answer and simply makes a guess.We are being asked to accept that a poor kid in love would willingly give up the winnings he has accrued to date because the woman he loved answered the mobile phone when he decided to use a lifeline and ""phone a friend"" in attempting to find the answer to this last question. Of course, he did not know she would answer it, but it seemed he had already made some inexplicable decision to gamble his accrued winnings.In this situation, any reasoned person would accept his winnings to date, collect the cheque, and put the money towards investing in a career through which he could support his (supposed) future wife - and use the money to invest in her career as well.But no, he gambles all that potential life enhancing value because of love. The ending and the last 30 minutes were nothing more than contrived nonsense.In fact the love story itself was limp - there was no rhyme nor reason as to why the lead character was in love with his girl; there was such limited dialogue and interaction between the two of them that they may as well been passing strangers.The idea of portraying scenarios explaining why the lead character knew the answers was interesting - to a point - and did explain his upbringing, though as many have noted, quite how he progressed to well-spoken English is left unexplained.The vignettes themselves were uninspiring as stories in themselves - quite what is so funny about a boy covered in faeces I am not so sure; lame humour at a kid's expense. This was followed by episodes of child torture and criminality - malevolent stuff indeed.",Slumdog Millionaire
935,jack1992,Life-Affirming,10,28 January 2009,"Danny Boyle has proved time after time that he is one of the best directors alive today.

The acting is very well done, with newcomer Dev Patel displaying his skills. The child actors for youngest, and middle Jamal, Salim, and Latika are superb. The cinematography is unlike anything is recent cinema. It adds the perfect touch to the films high octane pace. The setting of India is heartbreaking, yet full of hope as a nation climbing it's way into the ranks of world powers. Surely, I believe that this will be a major winner this year at the Oscars, and rightly so. The film proudly displays that life is a gift, and every moment in life is meant to be cherished.

Before I start, here are a few recommendations...1. Salaam Bombay (Go watch it!) 2. City of God (As pointed out by many here) 3. Kite RunnerSo there are parts of the movie that can be credited to the director esp. for getting great work out of the slum dwelling kids. The Music director (fyi: Bombay Dreams) is certainly well known in those parts of the world and being familiar with his work, the music was certainly not his best till date.-The director seems to want to showcase the flora and fauna of India and in a matter of minutes, there are camera shots of the hill stations in southern India to the desert in the western part - all on the same train?-The protagonist in the film, seems to have captured the attention of millions of people, yet after he has successful won the show, manages to sit at a train station - completely unnoticed?? Really? -The policeman sits in his vehicle, as someone stands in front burning? Huh - Am I to assume the impression is that somehow the law enforcement is to be played out as a joke?I am at a lack of words to express how silly this movie is!

The way the most painful moments in the life of the protagonist wound up making him stronger and stronger as the movie moved forward was wonderful. How better to tell people that even their darkest moments may, in some small way, make them stronger in the future. What a great film! I also think the selection of actors made this film a great success. The reality brought to the screen by individuals who are most likely all too familiar with the difficulty faced by the ""slumdog"" population made their pain as realistic as possible.",Slumdog Millionaire

It was a tooty fruity human rights film and i am absolutely appalled by the fact that it has gotten this much attention. Yes i get it India has problems but so what!i believe a film not a movie but a FILM appeals to people because beyond the desire to be entertained we want to be able to connect. In order for this to be achieved the primary motivator of the story has to be the characters personal struggle. If not- and it's the plot working as the primary motivator than it is in fact a blockbuster- Jaws, Star Wars, Legally Blonde etc. don't get me wrong i love a healthy dose of blockbusters but I'm aware of the difference and trust me there IS one.But films - Schindlers list, Fight Club, Gladiator, Terms of Endearment, The Duchess, Breakfast at Tiffanies, Lost in Translation, the Squid and the Whale- these are all films that allow you to connect with someone- films that offer depth, and analysis of the human condition.

The sole purpose of this movie was to create a negative image of India and there was nothing else. The story was not believable. It seemed as if the only purpose was to show dirt, grime and human waste and the story was just thrown in. There are many bollywood movie flicks which have the same elements as this movie had, only they are directed much better, with tighter scripting, editing and cinematography. Its a surprise that this movie was even nominated let alone get awards. Incredible. Just wondering if world tastes are coming down or it is something else.",Slumdog Millionaire

Other than that, nothing. Really, nothing !People are saying that this film shows a very negative side of India. But I say that about 28% of India live in this way and we just ignore it. Only the middle class and the ultra rich enjoy India's development fruits and I think the film shows a few hints of it here and there.The plot is not the usual rags to riches story, but if you are an Indian, you would think I have seen many films like this...but this is not one of ""those"" many films.

942,vasant_6969,Slumdog Millionaire a Pathway to Oscar ! A clear winner,10,26 December 2008,"Excellent, superb, fantastic is the word that I wanna use for director Danny Boyle.This time he has picked up a completely different subject to portray unlike his previous films. While watching through the entire movie I was amazed how closely this person was able to capture small moments that mesmerizes our minds and stays on for a while. Great job done. Most of us were amazed and asking this question to me whether this movie was actually made by Danny Boyle or by some Indian director. Never ever throughout this movie you'll feel that this movie has been directed by a Hollywood director.The treatment and the feel of the movie was awesome. This one will not knock the doors for Oscar but would rather kick the doors and break it down until its open and I mean it. This is one movie which cannot go unnoticed. In my own words I see many shades of ""Salaam Bombay"" which earned India its 2nd Oscar nomination, but this was better than Salaam Bombay and even not as depressing as Salaam Bombay. It has fantastic and soothing ending unlike Salaam Bombay.Performance wise the heart and soul of the movie has to be the 2 small kids from the where the movie starts off, they were so natural and the best part was that they reminded us the actual 80's & 90's feel yet not depressing and it has its life on it own which is immortal.The movie has already been praised outside India. But I'm highly disappointed by the producers as its not been promoted in India to large extent which it surely deserves. This movie needs a high promotion just like Ghajini as it is the only best movie of 2008 if try to compare it with any movie that has released in 2008 so far.You'll have to watch it to believe.

In my my opinion it should be above The Godfather I and II, and also in my opinion this movie it's greater than TDK, although, TDK, deserves it's rank.OK, short story long, you will be amazed by this movie, you will leave the cinema with a great feeling.",Slumdog Millionaire

Well, without the awful stuff the kids go though. But like how it looks. Well when the Jamal goes on Who Wants To be A Millionaire he gets to the final question. But he dose not know it. He calls his brother, who gives his cell to Jamal's love interest Latika. Latika answers. Well his brother ends up dieing which you can guess. But the film is wonderful and everyone should see it.

It had too many moments were it didn't know what genre it was. It wasn't a clever blend, it was just a mishmash of genres which felt like someone put together a puzzle with a sledgehammer with the intention of it being a perfect picture, but there was too much attempt of putting power into the intricacy of the film and it was smashed leaving only a few pieces actually looking good.Saying that, the film did have it's memorable moments. Anil Kapoor was very memorable as the Indian Chris Tarrant, and A.R Rahman gave the film a successful score. Danny Boyle's direction was unmemorable, which was disappointing considering his previous repertoire of films.Overall the film was annoying and a massive let down, with memorable moments, but not enough of them to get past the fact that the screenplay was written so Simon Beaufoy could cram every possible style of film into one collage of a script",Slumdog Millionaire

Brilliant directing and storytelling brings such a simple story to life. I thought that The Dark Knight would not be topped this year, I was wrong. I was very unimpressed with The Curious Case of BB compared to Slumdog.On another note, Slumdog uses a no-name cast which shows how good of directing Danny Boyle does. He does not need a strong character actor in order to get the message across. The film keeps you interested from beginning to end and takes no short cuts or overdrawn pointless scenes. By the end of the film, you will shed tears of joy and reflect on one of film's greatest marvels.",Slumdog Millionaire

But I must say that the negative sentiment against this film for showing poverty is illogical and a low IQ sentiment. When the same director made Trainspotting(based in Edinburgh) it did not mean that everyone in Edinburgh is a drug addict.Similarly this film SM does not mean that India is full of JAMALS or LATIKAS(READ POOR PEOPLE). Please all Indians should realize that it is just a fiction film based slum life as its by ground.Watch it and don't listen to any Indian criticizing this film.I am an Indian and I loved it because Iam not stupid!,Slumdog Millionaire

The  revealing look into the Mumbai slum is just one of the beautiful and  terrifying story lines. The use of flashbacks to tell the story took  you on a journey in time and culture. They used three sets of actors of  three different ages to move the story. The use of the youngest actors  (actually slum kids from Mumbai) stole the show. These kids were  incredible showing both the beauty and the horrors of growing up in Bombay.

It should not be missed. It tells the story of Jamal, a teen from the slums of Mumbai, India, who goes on the Indian version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" His main purpose for going on the show is to make contact with the girl he loved and lost in his childhood. It is an epic love story and a film that deserves to be ranked with such classics as ""West Side Story"" and ""Casablanca."" I had a particularly hard week when I saw this movie, and as soon as the film began my problems went completely away for two hours. I was totally involved in Jamal's story, and it didn't let go until the credits finished rolling.That's the reason we go to the movies anyway, isn't it? I am glad the Academy finally picked a crowd pleaser to sweep this year's Academy Awards. In my opinion, this film deserved every one that it won. The music is amazing!

All the accolades, the golden globes and every praise the movie got was heard before i saw the movie. So the excitement and expectation to watch the Indian 'City of God' was tremendous. And...the movie delivered. It presented an entirely new face of Mumbai which is rarely seen in any of the movies rolled out by Bollywood, based in Mumbai (quite ironic......). The direction, the acting, the music everything was superb but the aspect which won it for me was the camera-work. Each shot, each angle shouted Perfection(with a capital P...) The movie started off brilliantly with the small kids running from the cops and the parallel story of the older Jamal in the police station getting tortured. The movie grew darker and a bit comic simultaneously showing the ugly face of what actually happens to slum kids on the streets of big cities. The movie slowed down a bit in the middle and i personally didn't like the end. Not that i didn't wanted the slumdog to win millions but the way it was shown was a bit over the top. May be it was a rags to riches story and the writer wanted it to be like that. An Oscar favorite for the Best Movie but don't think that it can win. Maybe a nomination might do it justice.

955,sganesh88,An average film. Nothing worth the buzz!,6,28 January 2009,"I'm honestly surprised about the recognition and buzz about this film throughout the world. And 10 Oscar nominations!! Man.! How are stupidity and ridiculousness instantly absorbed and appreciated by people without hesitation? OK. let me be pragmatic in my turning down this film as average.Most things about the film is clichéd. Every damn bad thing imaginable in India happens to the protagonist. But the protagonist overcomes them all. In a way, it confirms what many outside India think about India. People rolling in sh*t, dirty slums, caste based riots, begging, cheating, poverty, cunningness blah blah. All packed in one tight container name ""Slumdog Millionaire"". The only good souls in the movie are Jamal and Latika (and perhaps amitabh who generously signs autograph for a fan drenched in sh*t). We call this type of movies as ""mas ala"" in India. No logic. Lots of action. Fast paced screenplay. The protagonist finally smile along with his lady-love who does nothing essentially but just dances in a few songs. (Danny has satisfied even this criterion by making the duo dance with a suddenly formed gang in the railway station at the end of the movie) A typical bolly-Hollywood mas ala movie. A few questions.. How can a slumdog get the answers for every damn question from his life and win 2 crores of rupees? How can slum dogs speak such an excellent English to cheat the foreigners by impersonating themselves as guides? And did you notice their perfect slang?! Rupees is never mentioned in millions. Another attempt toplease the western audience rather than attempting to bring about the truth. Truth? damn! who needs it?! Why did Jamal reject the host's help? Why did the show host suddenly turn villainous? Why did Jamal's brother let Latika go at the last minute and get killed after ceremoniously killing the gang leader? My god! height of insanity.Certain parts of it are awesome without doubt. Music, screenplay, cinematography. The way the slum has been captured in the police- chasing-the-boys scene is really appreciable. A.R.Rahman is God. But these are nothing to justify the hero-worship the movie is getting. I'm not bothered about India being portrayed in this way by a foreigner. I just expected truth and naturalness which are greatly missing. 6 votes!",Slumdog Millionaire
956,jedidwyer,More excellent work from Danny Boyle,9,5 November 2008,"I just got back from Slumdog Millionaire and I can't think of many bad things to say about it. It's a beautifully paced narrative with superb acting. He got great work from the kids and the casting of the characters as they age is excellent work, allowing you to become very invested in them. The story was engrossing, the photography was stellar, and the exoticness and energy of India jumps off the screen. Boyle's frenetic camera work and India's frenetic pace are a great match. The Bollywood references are great and the final scene as the credits roll is memorable, leaving you with a good aftertaste. It's all backed up with a great soundtrack. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll cringe, you'll gasp... all that good stuff. I had a couple of issues with the ending but not enough to spoil what was otherwise a hell of a ride. A great movie and one that I highly recommend.",Slumdog Millionaire
957,captainjacksp,"Good movie, not worthy of Oscar",5,21 July 2009,"I agree 100% with the previous reviewer (yogesh).Especially on the fact that AR Rahman has scored countless masterpieces and this is rather mediocre coming from him.Also, not all of Mumbai is a slum. Not all Indian children have a rough childhood, either. I liked the movie in that it took all the elements of a commercial Hindi movie and combined them to create a slick fast paced ""foreign"" film. Credit to Danny Boyle and Loveleen Tandon for that. Begs the question, a movie based in India, based on an Indian story, starring an all-Indian cast, shot extensively in India, yet why did no Indian make this movie? Where were the self-proclaimed greats of Bollywood cinema like Yash Chopra, Karan Johar and RG Varma?",Slumdog Millionaire
958,collin-clark-22,Brilliant.,8,30 December 2008,"This is a movie unlike I've ever scene before. The way that the story is told is possibly the best thing about the movie. It's main focus is the Indian version of who wants to be a millionaire, but the film is much much more than that. It's about a Kid who goes from the biggest slum in Asia, to fulfilling all his dreams. This movie has the best child actors I think I have ever seen. Having them witness riots, murders, torture is truly terrifying. It really makes you feel for people in those parts of the world. I'm not saying that this is a sad film by any means. This is perhaps the only movie aside from The Shawshank Redemption that had me crying tears of joy. Go see it, best film of 2008 by far!",Slumdog Millionaire
959,rabinpatra,What movies are made of,9,18 November 2008,"This is how movies should be. A bit of fantasy, fling with destiny, touch of reality. We first see Jamal in the beginning about to win the contest, but then we see how all the events in his life were only leading up to this. Reminds me of Forrest Gump where Tom Hanks gets involved in all the major events of the nation's history. Or of Midnight's Children, where the destiny of the children all get tied up as the story progresses. Also great visuals of Bombay, the slums, the trains of India. And it does not flinch also - showing riots, exploitation of street kids, the police, the underworld, the greedy TV industry. Stunning acting by the street kids - the first half of the movie, the later half has some weak performances. Also, should have been made fully in Hindi, street children and low level cops speaking English just doesn't make sense.",Slumdog Millionaire
960,thirumurugan-k,Lacking in Nativity!!!,1,6 January 2009,"The language in which the characters speak is the soul of a movie. Cidade de Deus, Shichinin no samurai, Ladri di biciclette were made in native language and so the originality of the movie was intact even though I watched those movies with English subtitles. Slumdog millionaire is totally lacking on this aspect and it is definitely not a film to be rated in the top 250.I understand that the movie is made for western audience. But, It would have been better if the movie was made in Hindi and was released with subtitles to the western audience (similar to Lagaan).I prefer watching movies in native language with subtitles than watching a dubbed movie. So, it was hard for me to digest the characters communicating in English instead of in Hindi. This is definitely a major flaw and so the movie falls flat on its face.It is not surprising to look at rave comments from western audience, but this movie is not for me and also for those if at all there is anyone who feels that language is the soul of a movie.",Slumdog Millionaire
961,gmdwilbur,"Terrible, Don't see this film, you have better things to do with your time.",2,18 December 2008,"A film about a young boy in India who implausibly makes it all the way to the final round of India's version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"". It's not that he is a genius, it just so happens that the 20 questions they ask him coincide with the 20 most important instances of his young life! The answers are so ingrained in him, that they are a part of his very being! From the religion that caused his mothers death to the song that almost made him blind, every question is a chance for us to revisit his life story and reveal the ""heart wrenching"" past that made this boy who he is. Oh, and did I mention that the questions also just happen to be in chronological order, so that we get his life story all neatly packed up in a coherent time line that builds to the end of the film? What genius writing this is...Don't ever see this movie, ever. Its not worth your time, not even for the ridiculously out of place dance sequence at the end of the film. The whole thing stinks of sub par writing and less than original film-making. The one semi-clever moment was the transition between young and older actors (which occurred when they fell off a train and were rolling in the dirt, with the camera rolling with them (Straight on close up, ala Requiem for a Dream (The bridge from summer to fall) or the old MTV show ""Fear"") they then emerge from the dust as their older selves. Clever. Sorta. At least I thought they handled it well. But the whole film is really a series of poorly connected events that are meant to give rise to this epic love story, which is highly implausible due to the fact that the boy and girl involved were around 7 years old when they first met, but I guess it could happen. Really though, and this maybe due to the venue that I saw the film in, and the fact that I've been reading the ""Stuff White People Like"" by the guy at ""http://stuffwhitepeoplelike.com/"" (good stuff), the whole film feels like a chance for American and White audiences to feel cultured and understanding of those living in developing countries. Just look at the mise-en-scène of this boys past, which is filled with so much filth, dirt, and debris (at one point he even jumps into a vat of human feces so he can get an autograph of his favorite actor), that one couldn't help but root for him to succeed and conquer his troubled past, get the money, get the girl, and dance at the train station. The film is filled with hip and edgy montages (including a sequence set to that damned MIA song, you know the one, with the sound effects and stuff) that somehow allow the protagonists to get by with their miserable settings. In fact, these sequences are so bouncy and happy that they almost manage to portray their settings in a positive light. I suppose that its good to look for the positive, but how about a bit of realism for a change, a bit of truth of the cinema that shows the good and the bad. Because no matter how cool the music makes it look, fighting everyday for food and having to steal, and fight, and kill for your meals is not an existence to be envied. Did I mention that each setting that they exist in has a convenient mob of kids that are willing to make friends and strike a living together? It's just as great as Peter Pan and the lost Boy's out there! Who wouldn't want to join in on the fun? The energy of the film is terribly unbalanced, and I wonder if the book that it is based on ""Q&A"" is so one-sided in portraying the hardships of these kids. The worst part, if there even is one moment that warrants being put on top, was the fact that the films final climactic tension, the last bit of drama before we are released to the happy ending, was nothing more than the same tension one finds on an episode of ""Who Wants To Be a Millionaire"": Will he answer the question correctly? DOES HE KNOW THE ANSWER? OH MY GOD! I had almost hoped that the film would redeem its self with some crazy twist that requires the audience to revisit every sequence in the film to look for the hidden truth (there were some interrogation scenes that strongly reminded me of those from the ""The Usual Suspects""), but no. Instead, our final moments of the film are to be left up to the same devices as a TV game show. Pathetic. Just Pathetic. Top it off with one terribly, terribly, corny (and cliché) final scene where the protagonist and the girl are reunited (He says: ""It was destiny"" She says: ""Kiss Me"") and you have your self the stuff to make soccer moms and teenage girls swoon. And this is supposed to be independent cinema? Looks and smells like Hollywood to me... Bottom line: 2/10 Don't see it, don't rent it, don't even watch it on TV. Unless you liked Twilight, then maybe you might find this film enjoyable. Otherwise, beware.",Slumdog Millionaire

Be it the beggar syndicate, the thugs or Jamaal.Resplendent!!Perfect direction, perfect star cast, perfect music.I wish Danny Boyle and his team best wishes for the Oscars.

It plays into the ""Indian stereotype"" It shows India as a very very poor country, with the only job to riches being as customer service representative to Americans. This movie and nominated the movie for Golden Globe and possibly Oscars? Is there a rule within the Oscars where as no Asian film director is allowed to win an Oscar for a South Asian Movie? Because it seems to me that only White Directors are allowed to win? Bollywood is one of the Biggest Film Industries within the world with fantastic creative film directors who would not even get a look through the door at the Oscars, yet here comes a white film director, who has no Idea about Indian Culture, Indian films and now he and his moron writer are getting credited in making a Bollywood film? It just seems ironic that a foreign film director is getting accolade for a Bollywood film? It seems rather racist to me. What about great film directors like Mani Rattman, Ram Gopal Varma, Satyajit Ray, Raj Kapoor, the list is endless..... They have all made fantastic Movies. Yet never credited? Amir Khans Lagaan, and Devdas? Its not even a matter of the film director being White is just seems fake! Oscar accolade is fake! He should be ashamed of even excepting the award.Selling of world stupid ideas of poverty, that the Western view of any ""third world countries"".Danny Boyle doesn't even do justice to the Bollywod tradition of film making.If this film was made by am South Asian filmmaker, then western media would simply reject it straightaway calling it Bollywood and rubbish. But this is not the case here.Its made by a white filmmaker, and this is why it gets me so angry. Only a few months ago this film was destined to straight to Video but now its getting press for no reason at all! I also know that the Bollywood directors in India are really unhappy crying in their sleep by this director receiving all these international accolades.Non-white film directors cant win Oscars.You cannot ever win an Oscar because you are not a white. As simple as that. Only white directors are allowed to make films in South Asia, Africa etc etc.A nonsense film and it just goes to show how Racist the Oscars really are.Its just sad and i hope the industry starts to realise that there are good film directors in the world that are not white you know. 1-10",Slumdog Millionaire

965,tgyasmine,Dreams and Love,10,27 December 2008,"Slumdog Millionaire is an excellent movie that depicts a side of India with a cruel reality. The movie has a raw edge that is hardly found in most Bollywood films. Jamal, the main character, is excellent in playing his role though I was more impressed with the younger Jamal than the older one. The movie opens with the interrogation of Jamal, the 18-year-old boy from the slums who just won 10 million Rupees on the the Indian version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire. After picking all the right answers, his honesty is questioned as how in the world can an uneducated boy from the slums of Mumbai win 10 million Rupees on the show. He recounts his life story to his interrogators as he tells on how he knew the answer to every question.The picturesque scenes of rubbish-laden hillsides among the slums and tough travels on India's train system tells a story of struggle growing up homeless. The movie also recounts Jamal's experience of Hindus rioting against the Muslims in India, torching villages and people, and of a man who fed the homeless children and in turn use them to beg for money. And yet, one can still find innocent happiness among the children. Perhaps this had caused Jamal not have riches as his primary concern but rather just finding his true love that he once lost a long time ago. As if fate had it that he was only asked questions he knew of, like Benjamin Franklin on a $100 bill, but not Ghandi on a 1000 Rupee note which he did not know of. In the end, in his quest to find his love, and ironically not for the money, he wins both.",Slumdog Millionaire
966,prasad-subramanyan,"Vibrant, Pan-Emotional, Striking & Moving.",10,29 December 2008,"The movie Slumdog Millionaire is a name that doesn't quite tell you what the movie is about. Of Course it's about a slum-born Indian Oliver Twist who appears on an Indian version of ""Who wants to be a millionaire?"". But the move is so much more.The movie is extremely moving in it's plot narration. It's constantly on the move, striking a chord with every different frame, yet it doesn't dwell unnecessarily. From young Jamal's dive into filth for an autograph of Amitabh Bachan to the Anti-Muslim attack in the slum to the ""Orphanage"". Each plot element is elucidated just right. Not too shallow, not too boringly in-detail.Then there is the actual plot itself, much has been written about the moving love story between Jamal & Latika, of the coming of age of Jamal and how he trumps all odds. But what has not been brought out (from what I've read until now!) is complicated relationship between Jamal and his elder brother Salim. The latter, a character who is riddled with opposites. He doesn't let Jamal invite Latika in the post-riot scene, yet we never see an objection later. He rescues his brother from the orphanage/Mamon, but leaves behind Latika despite his brother's protests. He returns with Jamal back to his home-town, but abandons him after Latika's rescue. The movie in itself is moving in a umpteen scenes. Comically, as in the Taj Mahal scenario where Jamal is mistaken for a guide and he makes up a whole load of believable tosh about the Taj. Movingly, the one where Jamal recalls his encounter with a 100$ bill. Worryingly, with the way Jamal wades through human-excreta to get an autograph and how his brother sells it for some money. The movie is brilliant in its narration and moving in it's motive.Boyle has clearly given us one of the best, if not THE best movie of 2008.",Slumdog Millionaire

Slumdog Millionaire shows as the life can give many returns, two brothers and a friend with a life very difficult and afflicted, by the way, is a picture of thousand of children for this world rejection. I liked very the young actors that acting very well, had shown what really it is to represent. I liked particularly a scene it film, where the small Jamal sees its ídol and locked in a house of bath for the brother, it orders if for sewer where the people made its necessities, holding the photograph of its ídol without making dirty, and of followed runs to ask for the autograph to it and obtains. This history goes if uncurled of form very obtained well, with the two brothers of shapes and different personalities to follow opposing ways. The Jamal young inscribes in Who wants to be Millionaire so that it sees it to the Latika to try to change the life of the two, and has that to give the congratulations to the writer for the form as the questions that were made in the program were answered certainly by the Jamal on the basis of its experiences of life. It is impressive as this film obtains to captivate, great love that Jamal feels for Latika is impressive and shows in that never we must give up the people who really we like, and above all orders a great message, that the essences of the life is without a doubt the love, the courage and the friendship.

Danny Boyle has created a portrait of humanity not seen in a long time. This epic rags to riches story is a testament to the power of love and the truth. With breathtaking cinematography, stupendous acting, and an amazing screenplay from Simon Beaufoy, we are dropped into the mind of Jamal Malik, a young man from Mumbai. Through his eyes we see the pain of poor orphans, tricks played on various tourists, and the how organized crime has evolved in India's maturing society. Not to mention that Boyle and Beaufoy have given us a love story unparalleled. Despite much of the movie being in a foreign language, Slumdog Millionaire's story can be understood and appreciated by all, it is the first true global masterpiece.",Slumdog Millionaire
969,EddieM718,My Pick of the Year,10,2 January 2009,"Slumdog Millionaire is a fairy tale, a comedy, a tragedy, a love story, a tale of hope, a tale of brutal realism, a window into slum life in India and all with a dash of Bollywood. The basic premise of Slumdog is fairly simple and has been covered in depth by other reviewers. Jamal Malik, a product of the harsh slum life found in Mumbai's dark crevices, ends up a contestant on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. How does a ""slumdog"" with no education wind up being successful on the show? Behind each answer is a story, a story that hearkens back to events in Jamal's (mostly young) past, growing up with his brother Salim and eventually the object of Jamal's obsession, a girl named Latika) on the streets of Mumbai and how they do whatever needs to be done to ensure basic survival, whether it be, trawling around rubbish, begging, scamming or stealing.The early scenes involving young Jamal and Salim will move you, the two kids are absolutely adorable, and it's difficult to believe their acting is acting because their performances are hands down the best and most memorable in the film. In particular, the outhouse scene is absolutely classic. I haven't laughed and simultaneously cringed at a scene like that in quite some time. Notwithstanding the comedic moments, there are tragic moments that are difficult to digest, but important in conveying the harsh realities of their respective lives and the lives of many in the slums. In the face of all the difficulties of slum life and being forced to grow up well ahead of their chronological years, the two boys are remarkably resilient and that resilience to survive sets Jamal and his brother off in entirely different directions as they adjust to hard life in Mumbai. The cinematography in this film is superb. Even amidst the squalor of Mumbai's slums, the depth and vibrancy of the colours bring the city of Mumbai to life like no other film I've seen. It truly represents film as artwork. I was completely immersed in the Boyle's imagery of Mumbai, much as I was in the depiction of Rio de Janeiro in ""City of God"" and there are certainly visual aspects of Slumdog's story and cinematography that are reminiscent of ""City of God"". Anil Kapoor is superb in his role as Millionaire's host. He perfectly creates the tense atmosphere of the show. You feel the tension *as if* you are watching the show. I am not a game show enthusiast and I thoroughly enjoyed this aspect of the film. Previously not knowing that Anil Kapoor was a famous Bollywood actor, he was so believable in his role that I initially assumed that he was the actual host of the Millionaire's Indian version.There is clearly a fairy tale aspect to this film. But as one reviewer noted, to say the premise is unrealistic is to say that someone winning the lottery or a game show in ""real life"" is unrealistic. Putting that aside, the movie is not really about ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"", this is simply an unconventional vehicle to tell a harrowing tale of the life many children in Mumbai must live through and how it shapes Indian society. In fact, Jamal's motivation for being on the show has absolutely nothing to do with being on the show or becoming a millionaire, and that is made very clear during the course of the film. This is a different type of fairy tale, one overlaid on a harsh depiction of life for many in Mumbai. Some reviewers get caught up in the fact that the questions posed on the show all relate to some aspect of Jamal's life, when that is exactly the point. The movie would not work if it were otherwise, Jamal's appearance on Millionaire is just the means to the end and not what the film's focus is supposed to be, notwithstanding the film's title. Excellent film. You will leave the film with a smile on your face, but also appreciative of how harsh slum life can be in Mumbai.",Slumdog Millionaire
970,JosephLSteffen,Horror movie masquerading as an Indian game show comedy drama,1,1 January 2009,"The top reviewer said ""the story introduces one of the brothers as being the subject of a very strong interrogation"". Think of what the latter phrase is a euphemism for. It's not a spoiler but a warning to say that this scene is graphically violent, followed by many similar scenes. I walked out after 50 minutes.I really don't understand how this movie can be listed as a comedy drama, given the endless graphic violence it contains. The only audience laugh was when a boy is prevented from doing something he really wants to him unless he swims through a cesspool. Talk about potty jokes taken to an extreme! I wish I had never been talked into seeing this film. It will be a long time before I can get these extremely disturbing scenes out of my head.

I am wondering why this movie is flying so low on the movie radar. We only had two choices of theaters in our area of a gajillion theaters. It was well worth the drive though because we both enjoyed it. I'm hoping that this will win lots of awards because the movie and those involved with it deserve some significant praise.

You can watch this movie again and again and you will still feel the same sense of passion each time you watch it. I also loved how Salim, who had always ruined his life, in fact saves it in the end. I give it a 9 out of 10 because it is not perfect and I have never given a movie besides Shawshank a 10.

There seems so much stereotyping of the Indian culture for a western audience that it makes one wonder how credible much of the scenes are. To me it was a disappointing film as one could predict the final outcome well in advance.

The quality of the plot, the acting and the direction were first class and my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed it.How on earth some of the previous negative comments have been made about this film is beyond us - although everyone is entitled to their opinion.We will be recommending everyone we know to go and see this moving, exciting and uplifting film.We cried, we laughed, we were on the edge of our seats and we had real entertainment.Well done to all concerned.",Slumdog Millionaire
981,jmarko10,simply amazing....,10,12 January 2009,"I started watching this movie with no expectations. I had never heard of it at all. This movie, along with The Dark Knight, was probably the greatest movie that I've seen in the last 5 years. Simply amazing. You can't help but fall in love with the main characters. Most love story films do not do much for me, but this movie stands out among the best.This movie also gives you a greater appreciation for what we have and for what we take for granted every day of our lives. I had always heard about the slums of India, and how many parts of the country are poor, but this film opened my eyes to what it is really like.Outstanding film.",Slumdog Millionaire
982,norahgeorge,"""Slumdog Millionaire"" is awfulawfulawful",1,8 January 2009,"What is wrong with everyone? I see absolutely nothing of value in a movie that shows non-stop violence and horrific abuse. 99% of the abuse shown is toward children; which is incredibly disturbing. AND it is constant. The slums are horrifying. The camera pans the slums while showing adults and children being constantly abused. Children always running in fear. Throughout the whole movie you will see every kind of abuse that evil thinking can imagine.The accolades that Danny Boyle is receiving are totally beyond my logic and understanding. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, ever. I so wish I wasn't talked into seeing it. If I were in that situation again, I would definitely walk out. It was a horror to sit through. The movie definitely would turn one off to ever visiting India.",Slumdog Millionaire

984,plagden-1,A great feel good movie!,9,10 January 2009,"What a great movie! Danny Boyle has once again produced a film that is heart wrenching, powerful, and ultimately a film that leaves you with a big smile on your face. Great acting throughout, from actors most of us won't have heard much about before. Based around ""Who wants to be a millionaire"", Slumdog Millionaire takes us on the journey of a young Indian boy, who seem to know all the right answers to the money questions. One question before he can win, he is dragged off and questioned, as they believe he must be a cheat, due to his poor upbringing. Through flash backs, we learn why he knows all the answers, and indeed why he is on the show - and its not for the money. This is a fantastic movie, and very much award deserving.If there are only 1 or 2 movies to get you to the cinema this year, this has to be one of them!",Slumdog Millionaire
985,haydenbebbington,WOW!!! What a waste of 2 hours of my life I will never get back!,2,9 May 2009,"This was the worst movie I've seen in 15 years I have been on this planet, and I've seen some terrible movies in my time; such as, The man who fell to earth starring David Bowie, and Junior, a terrible 'comedy' starring the worst duo in the history of film making (Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny Devito). I recommend to anyone who is considering watching a drama based romantic movie; watch Titanic or the Notebook, both of which are reputably good movies which are not remotely over-rated. So if you are just walking by the video store and see this movie, KEEP WALKING! Unless of course you want to endure the pain of watching the worst Danny Boyle film you will ever see. This film, in my opinion, may be the end of Mr Boyle's career.",Slumdog Millionaire
986,amansaxena1984,silly nationalists,10,14 January 2009,"Its absolutely appalling that being an Indian myself I find that the people who are giving the movie negative ratings here and as well as on most other public forums are Indians.For once, let prejudice and nationalism (not patriotism) take a backseat and let people enjoy the movie for what it is.I always chuckle at my fellowmen cringing over the slums shown in a foreign film as if the directors intention was to portray the whole country as one which is in fact not the case. reflect any negative aspect of the country and we have our nationalists screaming foul and ruining ratings on a forum.Its amusing how at one end they would refuse to acknowledge the slum life as being an integral part of the dynamic country while at the same time would spend money watching pure B grade bollywood flicks running and singing around trees.So Amitabh Bacchan who in India is something like John Travolta + Brad pitt + Leonardo Caprio + Tom cruise put together x 10 blasted the movie for showing the country in a negative light. Mind you, this is the same ageing superstar who when goes to a routine checkup at the hospital, people line up in the thousands to offer their prayers.So I have one question for Sir Amitabh, had his blockbuster movie ""Black"" in which he portrayed a older teacher taking care of a young blind girl who eventually kissed her been made by a western director would he have blasted it for portraying all Indian men as pedophiles as well !?!? Or more recently his other work ""Bhagban"" where kids refuse to take care of their elderly parents portray the plight of an entire nation or a certain few Mr bacchan !? Obviously you can relate to what Im saying that movies are meant to pick on a theme and build around it they cannot cover each and every broad aspect or else you wouldn't have a movie.Or for that matter the hundreds of scores he has done running around trees singing proposing the actress realistic in any sense !? I can assure Sir Bacchan that not more than a 100 out of a population of billion would have echoed that sort of melodrama while finding their lady love.Danny Boyle has done a beautiful job elegantly touching the lives of people in the millions who live below the poverty line and their day to day struggles, something that the bollywood fraternity that is based in Mumbai itself rarely touches. I find it ridiculously hilarious that people would argue about India's growing economy and middle class base etc etc etc to somehow prove to the western audience the country is better than what is portrayed. Guess what ?! the western world doesn't really care a 2 hoots, they just appreciate a good movie. The strive for international recognition messes up with dumbfound nationalsim.Ignore them and watch this movie.I salute you Sir Danny Boyle !",Slumdog Millionaire
987,laxocool,Slumdog Millionaire is not the best but a great fairy tale movie worth-watching.,7,15 January 2009,"I decided to write the review after I read some really contradictory reviews of the film. I found that most of the foreigners were giving the film more than just great ratings and some Indians were giving some really bad rating for the film claiming that it as an obscure depiction of India and what the western people loved and expected to see about India. But what i can say is that what has been picturised in the movie is like 30 to 40 % India, but its not everything India is about and may be the scenario would have been something as shown like ten to fifteen years ago .I t does not show the present changing situation that is happening here. I am not claiming that there aren't any slums or brutal child labour here any more but i tend to say that the director has just shown only wrong or the bad aspects of our society. The instance where the quiz master tries to cheat Jamal and gets him arrested by the police might have happened somewhere in the west but not in India. There has been better Indian films depicting the real India and whole lot of that, but might have gone unnoticed just because they lacked global stage and global audience to rate the movies. About the music of the film, for those who have not yet heard any of AR rahman's timeless classics might have found them highly inspirational and engaging. But for many of the Indians here it's just another rahman track .So for people wondering why the movie got really bad reviews from some, these might be the reasons. For me the movie is more of an English man's view of how India still is after they left us(but i go with him as far as the slums, red streets and the child labour part is concerned).Watch the movie for the love, direction and the plot which bollywood might not have accepted for they might have thought it to be less lucrative. I give a 7/10 for Boyle's courage and for the cast of the movie.",Slumdog Millionaire
988,dava-roopchand,Danny boy pulls another gem outta his magic bag.,10,15 January 2009,"Slumdog was ******* WICKED!!! A film so upbeat and colourful that, by the time you're relaying its infectious air of optimism to friends, you could forget that it features orphans, slaughter, organised crime, poverty, enslavement and police brutality. The soundtrack is a joy throughout the film, the music is just spot on, so right. Oscar nominations for best Soundtrack & Score is surely in the bag. If not, who cares? Simply wonderful, a visual feast. The colours are amazing! It's all about the kids. They steal the show without doubt. Little Ayush Mahesh Khedekar is a future Indian superstar surely? Watch out Amitabh Bachchan, someone is after your crown. He was fantastic. Ayush is actually from the slums in Mumbai, plucked from obscurity to dropped into stardom.Oh, as for Freida Pinto, she has to be THE most beautiful, stunningly drop dead gorgeous creature to grace the third rock from the Sun.Awesome film!",Slumdog Millionaire
989,adityanarayanan,"Terrbily over-hyped , here's the reason : Good in parts, pathetic in others -",1,15 January 2009,"Saw this movie because 1) I am an Indian 2) The then IMDb ranking was a #42 in the Top 250 films ever ! I was like wow... I should catch this.. only to be utterly disappointed at the end. The reasons are very simple.If you're an international audience, i.e anyone not Indian, you would love this movie for it has so much of India in it , the poverty part of Mumbai/India especially and a novel way of explaining a related story of a TV show (Millionaire) so widely popular in the world. The premise is brimming with potential. A slum kid rises above fate to win Kaun Banega Crorepati (Indian version of Millionaire) -- the sets are ditto, as is the background music for the show -- and the love of his life. He is helped by destiny, as each of the questions on the quiz show is linked to an event in his life. Wow.On the other hand, if you're an Indian, 9 out of 10 chances that you would agree with the following : The execution falls very flat because of two basic flaws: The language barrier, and a wishy washy Bollywood story line. Read on.We flashback to the slum kid as a child diving into potty -- isn't once enough, given that Boyle's gritty and edgy Trainspotting featured such a nauseating scene too? -- to get Amitabh Bachchan's autograph. For all the Amitabh-crazed fans, maybe the mega-star does oblige children caked in excreta; be sure to try it the next time .And then, the kids (who deliver heart-warming performances, faring way better than those who play their adult avatars) and his brother speak in Hindi, and suddenly when they turn adolescent they start talking in flawless English. Huh? Well that's because the film is meant for a world audience, and you can't have an entire film in subtitles, you might say. Fine, but then why do the police officers have to speak 'Indian' English and why does the 'slumdog' have an accent? And no, a semi-literate office help in a call center does not develop an accent.In fact, a lot of the 'how he knows the answers' flashbacks are too contrived. Sample this, Jamal knows Samuel Colt invented the revolver because Salim got a gun -- it is never explained how -- and shot dead the vile man who heads the beggars' racket. In my hometown, the pistol goes by monikers like 'machine' in the netherworld; I doubt the average under-aged Mumbai underworld operative knows a Colt 45, or Samuel Colt. The first gun is usually what is called a 'country' revolver.And then there is the stereotyped, half-baked, black and white characterization, almost bar none. For example, Prem Kumar (Anil Kapoor ), the KBC host, is the typical villain who taunts the chai-wallah on his show; and the audience joins in with jeering laughter. Agreed, slum children get life's rawest deal, but not on live television. What is the director thinking ? No REALLY ! It is also not explained just why Prem goes after Jamal with such malice, beyond a muttered 'It's my show'. I can go on and on -- like point out that call centers serving customers in Scotland don't keep telephone directories of Indian cities accessible at the click of a button, and that mobile phones are not listed in telephone directories yet (that's how Jamal finds his brother again) -- but the point is that Slumdog Millionaire is miles short of what I had expected it to be.The really key events, the struggles of survival, are glossed over, and instead we get montage (albeit beautiful) shots hurrying towards a climax that leaves you untouched. A R Rahman's music is good, but not the master's best. But then, maybe on second hearing it will grow on you.I have no problems with the 'West' taking up themes of poverty and highlighting the real India. I can completely understand a foreigner being obsessed with the filth and the poverty -- I too was stunned by the plight of the homeless in New York -- of India. I thought Slumdog is brilliantly shot, and I am willing to forgive Ram dressed as a mix between Shiva and Krishna in a foreign film.But I do have a problem with a story that pretends to be real when in reality it is just a mas-ala film -- the kind we churn out by the dozens in Bollywood.Yes, Slumdog Millionaire is just superficial fluff, mainly because of its gaping plot holes. It should have been much better researched, and they really should have stuck to one language.Maybe the makers -- and half the world, apparently -- believe they have married Bollywood escapism with Western sensibilities, but it is not a match made in cinema heaven. It is more along the lines of 1970s Bollywood tear-jerker, the kind where the hero transforms from street urchin to gang lord in one running shot and where long-lost brothers are reunited by tattoos.Blame it on the hype.",Slumdog Millionaire
990,b94403,"Offensive, Depressing movie",1,16 January 2009,"I find the movie extremely offensive and racist. It shows Indian culture as bankrupt and evil. There isn't a single good Indian person in that movie. Every character in the movie is mean, ugly, corrupt, evil with no moral values. Is it only a coincidence that the only person nice to kid was a white American? I have had people ask me if India is like that? You can see comments in you-tube under India's version of Who wants to a millionaire that says ""what corrupt country gets its own contestant beaten up by police""? Mission Accomplished for the British director and his cronies. Do you guys really believe India is such a morally bankrupt society? Did these guys ever see the Indian version of the show before they made the movie? The host is extremely warm and welcoming (not condescending as portrayed in the movie). And why would any audience laugh at those condescending remarks??? And what is so uplifting about this movie? It is extremely violent and depressing. How come the west likes to see only movies that show abject poverty and misery? This movie is made by a westerner for a western audience so that they can feel good about themselves.

Two foreigners come to visit India rural area..where dev Patel guides them and in the mean time local people steal all the parts of their cars..and here dev patel tells them that this is India!!!!!!and in turn foreigners give money and tells that this is America.this particular scene has projected India as a beggar.But I would like to congratulate the director as he has taken a lot of pain in researching about India's current scenario and bringing out a story in a form of a film.Great job done,Hats of the director and to the whole crew members..

I like the way he touches so many subjects neither glorifying them nor ignoring them.""poverty"" ""communal riots"" ""hero idolism"" ""child abuse"" ""child exploitation""the only disappointment comes where it is shown that the India is progressing away from such abject poverty and abuse/exploitation which is ""FALSE"".As an Indian, I would say ""Hats Off"" Danny and Simon.

993,Phu_Dong,Danny Boyle has insulted the noble art of film making by making a piece of non sense,1,22 January 2009,"My vote for this piece of junk is 0 out of 10.It is a politically incorrect film as its title is an insult to poor people who live in slums.Simon Beaufoy has done a bad job by mocking poor people.It is my guess that he did all this to influence audiences as the title of the original book written by Vikas Swarup is Q & A There is nothing worth seeing as Danny Boyle has copied Bollywood style of making films.His film is also a stupid flick as he has put famous Indian monument to win praises from White people who go to India only to see that monument.The entire flick is fit only to be a television soap opera.This film will not benefit Hindi cinema of India as Hollywood will always typecast Indian actors as they have been doing with actors from Hong Kong.This is a film whose success in the west will surely assure that not many tourists go to India as no one would want to go there to see poverty,crime and discrimination.This film is a kind of artistic terrorism.Stay away from it as you have been warned about its dangers.",Slumdog Millionaire
994,manxkp,It's a roller coaster ride! Best film of the year. Watch it now!,10,24 January 2009,"Slumdog Millionaire deftly portrays stark poverty and the stark contrast conspicuous in the Indian society wherein the millionaires live within a stone's throw of a million slum-dwellers. The movie never fails to highlight the spirit of these people who embrace the extremes and are relentlessly desperate in fulfilling their dreams.Those who criticize the film calling it a westerner's portrayal of Indian society had better realize that our own Bollywood directors have still not got off the 'India Shining' bandwagon. Their NRI cinema is far from the bigger reality. Movies are meant to hold a mirror to the society and Slumdog Millionaire does exactly that(of course in a dramatic way). It's realistic, contemporary, lucid and has a deep message. The movie revolves around three characters-Jamal Malik, Salim Malik(Jamal's brother) and Latika(Jamal's love interest) who live in abject poverty in Dharavi(world's largest slum) in Mumbai. Despite his horrific, unimaginable experiences like riots and even a near-mutilation, the protagonist Jamal is essentially scrupulous. He manages to get on the show 'Kaun Banega Crorepati'- India's version of 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire' only to establish contact with his lady love, an ardent fan of the show, who is a gangster's keep. The host and the entire nation is spellbound as to how a 'chaiwalla', who has no formal education, answers every question thrown at him. But his real motive is not big bucks but love. Herein lies the beauty of the movie which manifests that true love transcends everything else. Danny Boyle takes out the best from his actors(esp. the child actors). Simon Beaufoy's screenplay is breathtaking. Rahman's music elevates the film. At the end of the day, Slumdog Millionaire lives up to the hype surrounding it. It deserves all the accolades its getting worldwide. It certainly is one of the best India-centric movies ever made. Watch it! Such a movie come once in a decade. Here's hoping the Oscar night turns out to be Slumdog's night...India's night. Jai Ho!",Slumdog Millionaire
995,minukumar,Not as great as it is being made out to be,5,22 January 2009,"All the folks that I talk to rave about this movie. Criticizing this movie has become like criticizing Obama. No one wants to hear it. I feel that the movie tries to package the more than well trodden Hindi movie masala themes into a more western friendly style. The good part about the movie is that it does this well. Also it does the story telling in a somewhat novel way. I also feel that it tries to provide realism in a very superficial way. Exhibit 1: The protagonist speaks Hindi all through the childhood (this part was realistic) but starts to speak middle class/upper middle class stylish English when he grows up (stylish in the Indian context). How did he learn the language so well? I think the casting could have been better. Also Rehman's music is highly overrated in this movie. This certainly is not the best music Rehman has given (I know the GG award was comparing this music with nominees in this category). I have loved many of Rehmans compositions and follow his work carefully. Glad that someone has given more technical thought and insightful comments than the usual ""shows in India in bad light"" argument. If this movie wins an Oscar apart from the GG, I certainly would see merit in the disappointment of a whole group of Bollywood directors whose movies were much better than this one. Sorry just a mediocre movie.",Slumdog Millionaire

Indian people are very tolerant and they are known for their artistic tastes.No one in India protested when Sir Richard Attenborough made a classic film called ""Gandhi"" in 1982.That was a film made by a British film.Many people in the world still admire that film for the vivid and honest description of India.Danny Boyle is also an Englishman and even this film's writer Simon Beaufoy is an English but it is a shame they way they have twisted facts to show India in a very bad light.They have completely mutilated the original material which is present in Indian diplomat Vikas Swarup's book Q and A.Since a score of zero is not available,I am giving it a one our of ten as it is a really awful movie.Let me also state why this film is being liked by people in US,UK and elsewhere.Slumdog has come out at a time when Hollywood has almost run out of ideas and India is a big market for American and British products.So this movie is just a tool for Americans and Britishers to put India in a bad light to impose their ideas on Indian audience.",Slumdog Millionaire

998,anushyam1,Made for a Western audience,3,25 January 2009,"Imagine a movie made in America, by an Indian, that only has gang violence, teenage pregnancies, rabid racism, gun toting semi literate youth from the ghettos, young girls in bikinis with multiple partners, fornicating all the time without protection. But, you would argue, America isn't just all about the above, there is so much more to America and Americans than that! Exactly! Welcome to ""Slumdog millionaire"" a movie that looks at everything that is worst about India, and nicely packages it for a gullible American audience.For every slum in India, there is also an educational institution that offers some of the best education in the world. For every slum lord that makes money off little children, there is also a sympathetic lower middle class housewife who despite her daily struggles, finds time to teach her maid 's son or daughter, some basics of education that the child may have a better life than the parents.That this movie, has been nominated for all those Oscars comes as no surprise to me. American society does not want to hear about how high educational standards are in India, the respect shown to elders, abstinence and moderation of the Indian middle class. Which is why movies like ""Born into brothels"" and ""Slumdog millionaire"", are the only ones that make it to mainstream American audience (Perhaps a secret gratification in seeing the misery of others, and feeling better about oneself?). You want to see some really good movies made for an Indian audience? Go watch ""Jodha Akbar"", or ""Rang de basanti"" or Water.The real irony is that Jamal Malik (Dev Patel), is a Hindu in real life, but is portrayed as a Muslim, tortured by a Hindu police inspector(Irfaan Khan) who is a Muslim in real life. Put that in your Hookah and smoke it!",Slumdog Millionaire
999,sambitprem,unrealistic & over-rated,4,27 January 2009,"Scenes of poverty and squalour may appear romantic to Westerners and to our snooty elite but for ordinary Indians they are nothing new. They are an everyday reality. However, one wonders what sort of mind can find such images aesthetically pleasing. Party-hopping socialites (for example, Shobhaa De after all her bombast of ""enough is enough"" after the Mumbai attack, went and watched a pirated copy!) who are distanced from such reality may find this film an ""eye-opener"" but for us it IS just poverty-porn. Leaving that aside, I have eight other objections to the film. 1) The director seems to RELISH showing violence. Some of it (like the police-torture) is quite needless. And why was the boy arrested in the first place? On what charge? Was it realistic? 2) How can a boy growing up in slums speak such accented English? Even if one assumes that the language he actually uses to communicate with the game-show host and the police officer is Hindi (granting the director the creative license to use a language better suited for international audiences), there are 2 instances where it is stretched too far: (a) when the boy becomes a 'guide' for foreign tourists at the Taj Mahal & (b) when he becomes a substitute-operator at the call-centre. 3) When the boy uses his 'lifeline' during the game-show, his friend discovers that she has forgotten her mobile and has to run back for it. This is plain Bollywood masala! Did the director HAVE to make it so melodramatic? 4) How did the boy know who invented the revolver just by watching his brother use it? How does his friend know about Benjamin Franklin? 5) ""Darshan Do Ghanshyam"" is NOT written by Surdas. It is written by Gopal Singh Nepali for the movie Narsi Bhagat (1957). This song is also credited as traditional and originally written by 15th century poet Narsi Mehta, whose life that film is based on. 6) After winning the game-show, the boy sits on the railway platform and nobody recognizes him! Considering the popularity of the show, is that realistic? 7) Two glaring omissions: To qualify for the show one has to answer several GK questions over phone or Internet. Even after making it to the show, a contestant can reach the hot-seat, only after ""fastest finger first"". All this is conveniently forgotten in the film. 8) And of course the greatest flaw in the storyline: programmes like 'Kaun Banega Crorepati' and 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire' are NOT telecast live. As a result the entire structure of the film becomes unrealistic. For a film that boasts of being realistic such a flaw cannot be overlooked.Anyone else wants to say this is a g-r-e-a-t film despite all these flaws?",Slumdog Millionaire
1000,lesamuraiii,Brotherly Love,9,27 March 2009,"I wasn't expecting much from this film. When a movie gets this much hype it typically leaves me wanting more. However, this movie has a certain charm about it that works. At the center of the story is the relationship between his brother, Salim, and a girl, Latika, who is left homeless after an attack that takes Jamal's mothers life. After running from a man who exploits the three for labor, they lose Latika in the midst of hopping on a moving train. Fate brings the three back together for a second and third time. Each time they come back together with a set of new obstacles and the final obstacle is him on a show (Who wants to be a millionaire) to win Latika and free her from her caged life. I thought the ending was uplifting and the brotherly relationship was portrayed very realistic. The film overall was an eye opener to a culture I have very little knowledge of, and the story was definitely well written. You can tell that the movie was low in budget, but it didn't stop me from enjoying it. Two thumbs up from me. Also the soundtrack was amazing. A well deserved Oscar - looking forward to more works by A.R. Rahman.",Slumdog Millionaire
1001,juliaemily-knox,So much more than a bollywood film,9,29 January 2009,"A couple of my friends were lucky enough to get press passes to the premier of Slumdog Millionaire in Mumbai on the 22nd of January. By all accounts it was a glamorous event where all the stars of Bollywood came out to shine. Apparently this is rather rare, to draw such a star studded crowd, so what was it about Danny Boyle's new film that had them all in their glad rags?Andrew and I didn't make it onto the elite guest list so we settled for buying one of the advance DVD copies which have been available on the streets of Mumbai for over a month  the DVD pirates here are really on the ball. This means of course that most of Mumbai had already seen the film before it premiered  but this will not stop the theatres packing them in for weeks I am sure.Although the film pays homage to the Bollywood model with it's daring colours, romantic narrative and big musical finale this is definitely no Masala flick (masala describes a film that is all spice and no substance). It's a classic story of boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back only to lose her once more, Boy wins millions on who wants to be a millionaire, and guess what gets the girl in the end. But it is so much more than that. For a start it has the smooth post production sheen that Indian films rarely attain, something that having been on Indian sets I'd put down to better organisation and attention to continuity, and of course access to expensive post-prod editing, cleaning and colouring techniques.But what makes it even more it's own film is it's honest and realistic portrayal of India's underbelly. The film is told in a series of flash backs as the hero relates his story under questioning by the police. The flash backs take you on a journey through the life of a Bombay slum kid, no holds barred. It's portrayal of an anti Muslim riot perpetrated by Hindus in the slums has caused some controversy sparking protests against the film. However I gather from Indian friends that such actions were all too common in the slums at one time, with the 2 religions clashing on a regular basis.Many of the begging and con tricks that the protagonists get dragged into and eventually start to devise are all too familiar to us as tourists here. Some of the worst stories of what goes on behind the scenes of the street kids lives are shown in heartbreaking detail.The film maintains a delicate balance of tragedy and romance, of violence and hope incredibly well, and with that dark humour that British directors are so famous for. Most of all though the strength and humanity of the main characters lend this love story real depth.But in my opinion the highest acclaim has to go to the talent scout who found the incredible children who played the roles of the main characters as they grew up. Plucked from the slums themselves these kids are so natural in front of a camera it's startling. These protégées bring so much to the film, taking the most dramatic scenes, both the tear-jerking and the hilarious. The young Jamal standing dripping human excrement from head to toe as he joyfully receives an autograph from his hero Amitabh Bachchan will stay with viewers forever.Whether you're a Bollywood fan or not this film is a must see, and I wouldn't be surprised if it inspired you to take a trip out there yourself although with your valuables carefully hidden away!",Slumdog Millionaire
1002,paulrevel,"Fear, violence, savage injustice and cruelty... hilarity and filthy beauty",8,1 February 2009,"Slumdog Millionaire ""Feelgood"". That's what was in my head as I sat down to watch Slumdog Millionaire − I'd read everywhere how it's the feelgood movie of the decade etc etc.So I was a bit surprised to find myself plunged into a world of fear, violence, savage injustice and extreme cruelty − though admittedly shot through with great hilarity and a kind of filthy beauty. It seems director Danny Boyle has done it again, and brought Trainspotting's pungent attractions to the notorious slums of Mumbai.The film chronicles the precarious lives of three kids struggling to survive in the dangerous, predatory world of the slums. The story is told through the sequence of questions in a nail-biting episode of Who Wants to be a Millionaire? Slum kid Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) inches his way towards 20 million rupees while the whole of India watches TV, transfixed − and so are we.Malik (one of the excellent ensemble in cult TV show Skins) has garnered much publicity for his role, but the three main characters are also played by other actors, as little children then as young teenagers − they all give mesmerising performances in highly challenging roles.The vivid contrasts of India also play a starring role in this film: baby scavengers in the mountains of rubbish, the glorious colours of a thousand saris drying in the sun, poetic train journeys, battalions of tuk tuks, the sleek glint of Mercedes and Dior sunglasses.There are many memorable moments, horrible, poignant and wonderful.Early on, young Jamal, locked in a 'long-drop' communal toilet, is desperate to escape to meet his favourite Bollywood movie star. He jumps into the brimming pit below one of the most disgusting things I have ever seen − and very funny.An idyllic orphanage turns out to be anything but: the children are forced into joining an Artful Dodger-style gang of beggars and thieves. But their masters are no cosy Fagins: youngsters with a talent for singing are chloroformed and blinded to increase begging revenue.A few years older, the two boys operate as inept, fraudulent tour guides at the Taj Mahal − their services include taking Polaroids of women tourists wanting to recreate the famous Princess Diana picture.Jamal's older brother Salim grows up to be a cocky, trigger-happy gangster working for the top dog who sweeps away the slums to build glitzy skyscrapers, while his childhood sweetheart Latika (Freida Pinto) becomes the vile old crime lord's beautiful, beaten mistress.As Millionaire reaches its climax, there's a tear-jerking welter of revenge, redemption and lovers united − finally that feel-good factor! The entire slum population crowded round TV sets rooting for their boy fair brings a lump to the throat.But don't leave your seats just yet − or you'll miss the best end-credits I've seen: a joyous disco pastiche of a big Bollywood dance number in Mumbai's iconic Victoria train station.",Slumdog Millionaire
1003,speedracer7000,One of the Best films ever made,10,1 February 2009,"Slumdog Millionaire is one of the best movies ever made. It is at the top of the list with crash and citizen cane. Brilliantly filmed, spectacular acting,amazing story, creative cast, and a great screenplay. It is a beautifully done and has many morals that effect us all. Dev Patel and Freida Pinto make a wonderful couple. Their chemistry is marvelous and stupendous. No movie in 2008 or 2009 can compare with this. Besides the fact that Boyle beat Christopher Nolan and Ron Howard is not only shocking but ""maybe its written""? I hope this motion picture wins best picture at the academy awards it deserves it for all of the hard work the cast and crew have put into it.",Slumdog Millionaire
1004,ajaykatkar-official,Great Movie...great music...,9,1 February 2009,"Amazing movie by Danny Boyle... have seen his ""Life less Ordinary"" earlier..n had liked that too... This one was amazing though... With the life of Jamal revolving around the Slums of Mumbai n going on to answer the questions, was just amazing storyline.. N the realistic view of the slums, well I guess he couldn't get more real! The only thing I felt was that he should have had used just one language in the entire movie, for the main characters. He starts the movie in Hindi, for the 2 brothers...their entire conversations happening in Hindi.. but as the story moves on...they move on to English...this was something awkward.. Had he made them speak in English after the Taj Mahal scene, where the situation demands to speak in English because of the entire Guide thing, it would have made more sense.. but anyways...the movie scores.. And after sometime A.R. Rehman is back with his winning tact's to top the box office! Great work with the music..loved the music instantly! And Paper planes by MIA just comes at the right time too.. So overall was a great package to watch!",Slumdog Millionaire
1005,mohd-tharani,Not good enough for Oscars,6,2 February 2009,"Danny Boyle has done a good job by making this film because it remembers the people of Mumbai that there are a lot of slums in Mumbai. Slums are the other face of Mumbai. Anyways, i wanted to talk about the film.I personally would not like the film to get an Oscar award because its not worth of getting this much big award, though nice but not good enough.There are many Flaws in the movie but I will share you the two most famous flaws of mine. Like the very first scene in the movie where the game show called ""Who wants to be a Millionaire"" starts, Jamal remembers the way he was treated in the Jail; Slaps of the cop, etc, and Jamal gets frightened. But let me tell you he(Jamal) gets bitten up by the cop when he is one question away from becoming a millionaire. So at the very beginning how can they show that he(Jamal) was frightened?? Another flaw was that the game show in the movie hosted by Amitabh Bachchan(Anil Kapoor) as shown, is given the same music and same style of the show, but they forgot that the real game show was never broad-casted live at any question, but in the movie at the last question they are broadcasting it live, as they have shown in the movie that everyone is watching the show at the last question.Just think whether this movie is worth getting an Oscar??",Slumdog Millionaire
1006,idamhr,The Sickness,4,13 March 2009,"It feels as if I have been hit with a terrible, incurable disease. Like the elephant man, who's abnormalities awakens fear and anger in the crowd. How can something be like this? It's not supposed to be like this.. but.. so things turned out.. 8 Oscars can not convince me.. - I laughed my way through Slumdog Millionaire. All my high hopes and expectations  which dramatically had increased the last couple of months - seemed to drop on the floor simultaneously with the movie's unbearable plot (or lack of plot..). It was as if my soul and heart got torn out of my body, leaving a dry, cynical scalp of skin and a hard, mean laughter. The sickness. As a big fan of Milk, I expected a true masterpiece from the hands of Danny Boyle  something amazing it had to be, if it could win over Milk. But, oh, Danny Boy, how could you go so wrong You can't cover an empty, meaningless, predictable plot with beautiful pictures, cute Indian children with glittering eyes and heart throbbing music. The flat characters, the wannabe social realism-coverage and the corny love story WILL shine through.In advance, I knew that I didn't have to use my brain for this movie, it was okay, I was so ready for this hopeful, happy-go-lucky, beautiful masterpiece. But it bullied happy movies! It made a joke of its genre! It's the most embarrassing stunt in film history I'd ever seen. Even the hideous, awful Danielle Steele-movie I saw a week before, had more depth and realness in it. The slum of Mumbai seemed so joyful and colorful; I thought ""yay, this slum I have to visit, they seem so happy"", and wow, they sure learn English much faster that any other western country does. There sure is a lot of stereotypes in Mumbai you're born as one character (Salim was a gangsterkid, too obvious that he would turn out deceiving and cruel) and it doesn't really seem to change.Through the years I've seen many Bollywood-features and enjoyed their charm and humour: their self-realization of their genre. Clichés in row. But they can bear it, because they are TRUE to their theme: they don't pretend to visualize the hard life in the slum, they don't give a false depth to a character. They admit that they are predictable. But Slumdog Millionaire what would it tell us? That even if you had a rough childhood under poor, miserable circumstances, you can turn out millionaire? I really don't get it. And I almost threw up during the last scene. ""Kiss me""  and then dance the Bollywood dance! Never have I seen anything this embarrassing. I held my hands over my eyes. I couldn't bear it.After the movie, I missed the last train, and that just made me more angry and miserable. And sick. What is wrong with me, since I feel this way? How can such a horrible film receive this great acknowledgment from high profiled film critiques. It's one of our time's biggest mysteries.",Slumdog Millionaire
1007,vispi_t,what you may not like ....??,7,4 February 2009,"Good movie, fantastic editing, excellent scene composition, nice lighting & storytelling, ... and the list is endless... but then there is something that I would think was unnecessary .. which diverts your attention from the main theme .. and here is what i call the Director's mis-direction ... although for a little while...The character of Anil Kapoor... The host for the Show...!! Although from the very beginning of the movie... we see that the host is not happy having a ""Chai-walla"" on the show... and hence a sarcastic humor .. and the tendency to underestimate ""Jamal"" ...Only till this point is the Host's character acceptable!! What goes beyond expectation is that the Host (Anil Kapoor) feeds an answer to ""Jamal"", which later is discovered as wrong!! thus making the host a negative character - which is unnecessary.Secondly, The suspicion should have been raised by someone else and not the host. and ""Its my Show"" .. . that is what i could not digest !! It is too big a truth for me to swallow that, one is able to have the right questions co-incidentally for the answers he has learned in life... but it would be very practical to show that at least on one question, he received a timely help.. of course from the host.Thus saving the movie to go in direction not really asking for.",Slumdog Millionaire
1008,reservoirdog96,don't bother wasting your time on this movie,1,31 May 2009,"First of all the story wasn't great and frankly just stupid. I saw in the cinema only because it got good reviews but i was let down so much. Danny Boyle is a great director and i respect him but he should not have made this useless movie. First somehow Jamal k. Malik wins the ""who wants to a millionaire"" game show based on past experiences that don't make any sense (if he grew up in the slums how could he be so smart no education). Then after he celebrates by singing and dancing in such a fake accent it is not even funny. Then just randomly run in the streets how weren't they killed there would be cars.Then gets arrested (which would not happen in real life)for cheating and gets interrogated. I think the Oscars are rigged because it was not Oscar worthy in my opinion, because the Oscars it got was only really dumb things like music and cinematography. Hear my words don't bother with this movie you'll waste your money.",Slumdog Millionaire
1009,piratish,"Beautifully structured, dusting off old clichés",10,7 February 2009,"I thought this movie was phenomenal in every aspect. I'm well aware India's poverty has been done to death, but the way Boyle portrays is breath-taking. I'm not saying I'd throw Indian's religious ways and stereotype their culture for a few good camera shots. But what people don't focus on here is that this isn't about India. It's about a young man, despite all the trials and tribulations he confronted in his life, met his destiny. It's taken all those over-killed American clichés and transformed it into something new; I came into this movie expecting a feel- good fluff picture, walking out of the theater going 'Aw, that was cute.' And forgetting about it minutes later. Don't start a hateful conflict for this movie. If you're wanting Danny Boyle to take an hour of of this movie portraying India's majestic beauty and rich class, you're destroying the boy's story. This wasn't what he went through, it wasn't his life. Stop confronting the aspect of 'It's insulting this/my culture! With an undeniably terrible cliché' You're getting offended so quickly, you're knocking it before it even gets a chance to show you it's beauty.It forms a love story that is timeless, a young man's undying commitment and loyalty to a girl. His endlessly strong spirit thrives despite the hardship she's faced, and how destiny circulated his life in every aspect. The way this was directed made every morsel of it seem satisfying, near perfection. This is his life, and if you're going to dissect it every so crudely into something worthless, go ahead. India inspired this love story, and if you're underrating it because of it's 'cultural differences' in your eyes, take a look at all the directors that have abused the poverty of several countries in their films. Some of them are insulting Danny Boyle at this very moment. Don't get offended, this movie's not trying to trash your culture. It's love, undeniably flawed yet perfect love. Boyle's intention wasn't to reprimand India's slums. Of course, though, when a movie get this much praise there's always bound to be tension at some point. Some deep flaw that everyone should notice, pointing out the stupidity of all who praise it.What I'm beginning to disdain is the backlash this moving is receiving. Not just from the Indian cultures, but from some directors as well, even one who was featured along side at the Toronto film festival. You're settling to sour this movie over details that you derive from it. If it's not the cultural details, it's the appearance or ending of the actors. Dear God. Get off your high horse.",Slumdog Millionaire
1010,global-netizen,"Great theme, bad film-making",5,8 February 2009,"Finally I saw 'Slumdog Millionaire', And to say I was disappointed, would be an understatement. Separately, each element of the film, seems to be a great, at least a good film in the making. But put together, it doesn't add up to anything more than an average film. As a whole, I am not left with a great cinematic experience at the end of the film.And my criticism is not about the usual objections brought up. I have no issues with the depiction of poverty in the movie. In fact contrary to the brouhaha, I hardly found any intense depiction of poverty. Yes, there is a gut-wrenching scene of a boy's eyes being gorged out. But its more about evil element the boys confront and overcome, which doesn't make the whole movie about stark poverty, like good old Mrinal Sen movies. Bollywood films have shown much more of these horrifying scenes, and we have seen them without batting an eyelid. So its not fair to point fingers at Mr Danny Boyle for this. If Indian films can show our poverty in its most crass state, why cant Mr Boyle ? My criticism is purely about the technicalities of film making. Now that will immediately make you sit up and sarcastically question me, if I am an authority on it myself. Well, I am not. But I am a viewer and movies are for the masses just not for a selected few ""knowledgable"" persons. And as a viewer, I am left emotionless at the end of the film. Neither did it make me cry, nor did it make me laugh. Neither did I shed a single tear drop in the entire film, nor did it bring out a chuckle. Neither did it make me introspect or philosophize nor was it informative and accurate. And most importantly there is not a single moment in the movie to be taken away and remembered, like there are so many in Munnabhai MBBS , Rang De Basanti or Life is Beautiful. Not to mention our evergreen classic Sholay, which has so many great moments sprinkled all across the film - any filmmaker would be proud to have even one of those scenes in his or her film. Unfortunately 'Slumdog Millionaire' has none.Despite trying to infuse complexity and different layers in the story telling, 'Slumdog Millionaire' remains a simple linear form of story telling. It races through the narrative, without slowing down or harping on any moment. Its trying to shock us, but I am rather surprised at its complete lack of emotional connect, more due to the way the movie speeds through from one scene to the other.But I am not surprised the western critics and reviewers fell for this movie. There are so many stereotypes that the west just loves. But the master stroke in Mr Boyle's strategy was to use real slum boys for the film. This is impossible for the west to ignore , and lo behold the movie gets ten Oscar nominations.I am a firm believer of ""willing suspension of disbelief"" when it comes to viewing films, but Slumdog Millionaire's' unique selling preposition lies in its realism. And keeping that in mind I find it absolutely unbelievable that a boy who has become a national star on the sets of ""Who wants to become a millionaire"" could be tortured by cops. Can you believe what would happen to the cops and to the show organizers, when the news reaches the media ? I know this movie is difficult to criticize. The subject is such  children, that too poor children battling the odds in their lives. Our mind cant be so politically incorrect as not to like it. And especially now, when the whole world is appreciating it. I feel like the child in the tale of the 'King's New Clothes'. Neither am I a filmmaker nor an expert critic, but I am surprised that no one had the courage or the honesty to criticize the film for its real merit or the lack of it. The only criticism the movie has received has been on trivial and irrelevant issues, outside the meaningful discussion of film-making.The subject of the film is interesting and the screenplay Mr Boyle got to work with, must have been any director's delight  a definite recipe for success. But the end product in form of 'Slumdog Millionaire' is mundane and ordinary. Mr Boyle is unable to portray the complexity of the characters and situations and the narration is too fast and flat without exploring the minds of the protagonists. 'Slumdog Millionaire' is visually interesting, but not stimulating to the mind at all. The film moves from one scene to the other at a rapid pace without trying to emotionally connect the characters to the audience. Mr Boyle as a filmmaker is definitely not in the league of Robert Benigni or Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra. And not even of the débutant director Florian Henckel Von Donnersmarck, who made the brilliant 'Lives of Others', which left me speechless.Despite having a winner of a theme on hand, Mr Boyle fails in pure film-making terms. Luckily for Mr Boyle, the juries world over have stuck to political correctness and have not been able to discard such a socially sensitive and a cinematically attractive issue.And while the music and songs of the film are good and would have been commendable coming from any other composer, its definitely not among Reham's best. In fact it doesn't even remotely match up to his masterpieces from 'Rang De Basanti, Swades or the upcoming 'Delhi 6'.Without viewing 'Slumdog Millionaire' through the spectrum of awards and only on the basis of pure objectivity and cinematic yardsticks, the movie fails miserably. And Mr Boyle falls short as a filmmaker. This is definitely one of the most overrated film of this millennium.",Slumdog Millionaire
1011,MissNaylor,Beautiful and brilliant,10,9 February 2009,"I found this film such a treat to watch. I went with my friend, and honestly wasn't sure what to expect. I normally totally disagree with reviewers, and almost every review i had seen heaped praise upon Slumdog Millionaire. By the end of the film, however, all i was say was '.. wow!' Slumdog Millionaire takes you through a myriad of emotions. I went from happy, to sad, to angry, and over those again throughout the film. All the actors in the film were brilliant, but in particular Dev Patel and Freida Pinto stole it for me. I found their chemistry very believable and moving. At the very end of the film, several people in the showing i was at cheered.The only slight problem i had with it was what happened when the credits rolled. Had they left the story the way it was, i would have left with a happy smile on my face. But, for some reason, they chose to add a Bollywood-style dance routine right at the end, that made me a bit baffled.That didn't stop me and my friend discussing every nuance of the film all the way home.

1012,vivekm-undefined,a treat to all cinema lovers,10,10 February 2009,"I watched this movie yesterday with my friend.I was expecting a lot from the movie but it was far far better then my expectations.Slumdog millionaire is a real master piece by Boyle.The movie is based on the Vikas swarup's novel Q&A so Swarup's contribution can't be neglected.The soul of the movie is it's beautiful story line.This movie is very pacey ,I only came to know that 1 hour has been passed when interval was written on the screen. This movie insist your mind to stuck yourself on seats.When you will start watching movie you will find yourself to get connected with it and as the movie passes by frame by frame you will be inseparable from it.After long long time I finally saw a movie which was really heart touching and thought provoking.It also reminds us of fact that still 25% of Indian people are living below poverty line and a parallel poor India is running with rich IIM , IIT Graduates , doctors.The movie is about two slum boys Jamal and Salim and a girl Latika.Story revolves about their journey of love , hate , betrayal and fight to survive.Movie excels in each department whether it is cinematography , music , script and direction.Kids who have played the role of salim , jamal and latika in initial part of movie were really impressive.They take you with themselves in their own world .Dev Patel has done his job honestly.His dialogue delivery , expressions just shows his confidence in himself.He has lived the character of Jamal wholeheartedly.Irfan was not having so much time in 2 hr movie but he was as usual natural with his role.Pinto was beautiful and impressive.The guy who played the character of salim has also done justice to his role.I liked the character of Salim in story.He was honest to only one person in world and it was his brother.Manjerekar in role of Javed was OK. Narration of the movie is also nice and movie jumps between present and past.Simon Beaufoy's screenplay is marvellous.The music just adds another plus point to the movie .All songs are great specially Saaya and Jai Ho.And what to say about direction , Danny Boyle has done a great job .It might not have been easy for him to understand the emotions of a country which is far away from Britain. But he has done this job with perfection.It is very surprising and disappointing also that a oppurtinity which should have been adopted by Indian directors was opted and successfully executed by a British.",Slumdog Millionaire

Slumdog Millionaire is definitely one of the best movies I have seen in a while. I don't watch many Bollywood movies, because I have trouble with the fact that most are copies of American movies which my husband and I mostly watch, and mostly they are very unrealistic.This movie, however, is an honest movie about what the reality is in India. This stuff really happens. People in India are not too thrilled of the portrayal of the reality, because it shows the negative aspects of that Country. However, you cannot go to India, and escape that reality! There is severe poverty everywhere. It just breaks your heart. 1/3 of the world's poor are from India.This movie is just such an awesome story about survival, hope, courage and triumph of the human spirit.

The depiction of slums and there lives(You thought it was real, well the real misery is more then what got depicted however whatever depiction that was done was needless) 2. The movie is just like any other Bollywood movie with lots of twists and turns that looks magical and audience is made to believe that its destiny.3. Rehman is a true genius, but this is not his best musical work. Try movies like Roja, Bombay or even the latest Delhi 6.I Appreciate the director for coming and making a movie in India, however India is not only about Slums and Dog.I would have loved the movie if it hadn't got lost is trying to portray so called the reality of Indian slums.India is challenge, its a developing economy and unlike any other developing country it has its own problem, but then an outsider trying to come and show this misery to outside world is nothing but a fake attempt.",Slumdog Millionaire

This movie was absolutely fantastic, spellbinding and I loved it from start to finish. A perfect combination of fiction and non-fiction, that's how I saw it. It wasn't depressingly realistic or completely phony, in my humble opinion it had the perfect balance. It was a 'fairy tale' as many have said with some very grisly realities injected into the 'childhood' portion of the movie. This movie does not claim to be a 'true story' and deliver bogus depictions of factual events, so get over it. This movie was made for the joy of viewers world-wide and I believe that it has accomplished that goal.. A perfect fusion of bolly-Hollywood which should win the Oscar for best movie this year, I feel that aside from Hollywood politics and politically correct biopics made by actors for a sure-fire shot at an Oscar (Milk) that this was the most enjoyable movie of 2008.",Slumdog Millionaire
1016,vivek-livinglegend,A rare story that could have become a classic..Alas!,4,13 February 2009,"Last things first - 10 Oscar nominations, 7 BAFTAs, 4 Golden globes and God knows how many more awards!!!! And all these awards are assumed to be prestigious, pity! By now, I assume everyone may be aware of the plot and the basic storyline of Slumdog Millionaire. The film scores high on the cinematography, screenplay, music and actually the rawness the film has... Some sequences here remain true to the actual condition. Like the backdrop of Mumbai and other places in Uttar Pradesh are beautifully depicted. The filthy slums and the untidy subways are natural. Director Danny Boyle uses many sequences to show cheating and inhumanness with many of pretty apparent from the face of it and some sidelined like the one where Salim prepares the mineral water bottle from the bottle picked from rags and the sobbing kids shown with the women when the brothers go to find cherry on the Pila street (which only a sensible director like Danny could do)Now a story beautiful like this but how badly sub plotted!! Extreme loopholes which cant be ignored in the name of cinematic liberty1) Where the hell do you find Mumbai slum kids in some 1-2 grade in a local government school reading 'The Three Musketeers'?? I myself haven't read it yet!! 2) The kids are waiting for their turn to sing as if some Indian Idol auditions are going on 3) A blind guy can recognize his early year friend (who were barely their together for some days) out of the trillion people in the world after 5-10 years of their separation merely by touching his face. This guy can also smell and tell which currency is this! As if this was not enough, he can also tell the name of the icon on the foreign bill, smiling with pride as if he was the governor who issued this bill!!!! Oh Miss Rowling - we have found a better wizard than HaRRY PottER, here in India..!! 4) Oh!! The international tourists can't make a difference between the guides and cheats. Over the top they believe the fake story by these cheats about an International Monument overriding what is written in the guidebook issued by the tourism department. 5) The tourists are so innocent to even handover a $100 bill to the person who robbed them miserably... 6) Jamal knows who invented a gun. Why? His brother had once got it from somewhere and threatened him muttering sounding something like colt... (Jamal - what do u eat for keeping your memory this good)... Boss - I myself have a refrigerator, cycle, table, chair...and I didn't knew I was supposed to know the names of their creators... 7) And then you have a game show host who is unnecessary teasing you in public (Was that necessary - Indian shows are not like this though...)... 8) D: Destiny.....Truly!! GOD had planned everything in Jamal's in a chronological order so that when he goes to the game show, he has no problems to remember the answers... 9) Don't you dare think slum people are illiterate or something - when they grow up, they automatically learn to speak in accented English better than many of the highly educated Doctors, engineers, police do....That's why the latters go only till 60000 but slum people go up to be a millionaire... (This was the secret answer to Irfan Khan's question in the beginning of the movie)OK....OK.....I have many more weak points in the movie but I think I should leave something for you toooo...... The movie is a good time pass if you say so......entertaining onewith some strong points that I said earlier Cinematography, Editing are topnotch... AR Rahman's music grows on you and is superb...but again the maestro has some better scores to his credit that this is pretty expected from him....He should have got all these awards a lot earlier..Acting by all the actors is fine but the pick of the lot are certainly the child actors... I never understood the media attention Frieda is getting!! Don't mind it but she had a some 5 minute role totally and that too to look up to Jamal on the foot over bridge with a backdrop of a local train...plus the number in the end credits (which I thought was perfectly blended with the end credits)Finally, it was a brave attempt - Things depicted in a good way but a more should have gone into research and writing.... Nevertheless India has a lot of positives that these small negatives don't stand.....JAI HO!!",Slumdog Millionaire

I went to see this movie to see what all the commotion was with it being nominated for almost everything. Well, for once the critics were right and it was an inspiring epic. I knew that the nation of India knew a lot about making movies, since they view more movies than anyone in the world, but man alive this is a masterpiece. One person that I sympathize with a little is the main character. He is the underdog. He lived in some of the worst conditions ever known to man as a young child. That is where the term ""slumdog"" comes in. The host of the show, that he has so luckily landed on,keeps reminding him of that. Every question that he is asked he reminds himself of how he knows it or how he got a hold of that information concerning the question.

1018,vidana-2,This film touched my heart...,10,17 February 2009,"Such a wonderful film that it really touched my heart... The acting is superb, even the very little children play brilliantly. The directing is flawless. The plot becomes very interesting with the flashbacks. With every flashback, you learn more about the main character's background and the chain of events that brought him there, to that contest and every flashback answers why and how he knows the answers to the questions. With every flashback, the audience is moved, our hearts ache more, with every flashback, you get caught more in the emotional storm caused by the story. One of the best movies of my life. I am sure I will watch the DVD of this film many more times in my life... I strongly recommend everyone to go and see this film. When the film ends, the only disappointment is the fact that it ended.",Slumdog Millionaire
1019,rkd5023,Over-rated! Slum Dog should not win the Best Picture,7,19 February 2009,"Good movie, but Christ, it is over rated. It shouldn't get best picture, it really was not that entirely original or innovative. I am just so upset because it was good, maybe even great, but it was not anything that should win best picture or be in the top 30 movies of all time...I mean, seriously, the top 30? Wow, there are so many better films than this. There was not any part in it where I stopped and was like, ""That's great, never been done before or at least has never been done that well."" I don't know, even the ending was like, what the hell? I guess you could call it fairy-tale, because it definitely was not realistic...it didn't even really follow the themes of the movie, that greed and money is not what's important. He should have lost and felt content anyway because he got his love, it would have better made the point I suppose.",Slumdog Millionaire
1020,sudasgup-1,Slumdog Millionaire - Two points of View - View 2- from Sudasgup - response to Ajoy Gupta's View,8,21 February 2009,"Good review Ajoy, and I agree that compared to most past winners in Best Film category across major awards, this one is not a classic, not a film for posterity. It-s a very ""now"" film, as compared to that other British made India-based award sweeper ""Gandhi"". But it must be seen in relative terms to the ""competition""on offer, and the general mood prevailing in the Western world right now. In these times of hopelessness and bleak futures, with so many jobless and despondent, this offers a kind of comforting escapism, where a classic underdog, or Slumdog in this case, overcomes every kind of difficulty to emerge a winner, albeit aided in dollops by luck and destiny, but also by sheer grit and resourcefulness - very human qualities that are sorely needed right now. Interestingly enough, the film, while warmly received by critics in English-language press and TV, has been largely rejected by audiences in India. The Hindi version is officially a flop, while the English version has been a moderate success - qualifying the film as an average earner in box-office terms. In India, it is nowhere near the all-conquering cult status achieved in the West. In fact, there are significant protests and criticisms from the general public about the ""poverty-porn"" it peddles, and how India today is much more than the sum of it's numerous slum-dwelling poor multitudes.Therein lies a tale - to be rejected by the audiences of the very country whose story it tells,yet lapped up by an exotica obsessed West. The treatment is classic Bollywood, the basic premise oft-repeated in countless potboilers from the 70's through early 90's. The scene where the boys, while rolling down from the roof of the train, grow into teenagers is so typical of the hero's introduction scene from old Amitabh Bacchan movies, as also scheming rich men standing in the way of the poor protagonist, cruel cops, good brother/bad brother, bad brother turning a new leaf and attaining redemption before a violent death, innocent heroine forced into prostitution etc. etc.. So credit must be given where due , for Danny to get under the skin of the genre and deliver this movie in the way it has been presented, with no foreign actors (barring Dev Patel) and few foreign technicians, is an achievement in itself. It is by no means a great movie in the timeless traditions of earlier similarly lauded films, but it certainly seems to have struck an universal chord somewhere (barring India - where this is all too familiar) - and, credit-crisis notwithstanding,due credit - if only for delivering the right message at the right time - must be given! The soundtrack by Rehman is outstanding, but once again, from the Indian perspective, it is by no means Rehman's best - and if he does add the Oscar cap to all the other awards he has picked up for this soundtrack, I will consider it deserved reward for his whole, largely unheard in the West, body of work till now.",Slumdog Millionaire
1021,bitbitebyte,what does a slumdog possibly could know?,10,21 February 2009,"Slumdog millionaire has lived up to its hype and then some. This small David of an indie with a big heart is surely an indisputable favorite going into the finals, knocking away many a Goliath out of its way to victory. What a journey.There were some detractors, some who felt it was over hyped, and some who went to the extent of scheming sinister designs to bring down its chances of winning. But SM has to fulfill its destiny, and it is on its dream run. There is no one stopping this.What a night it will be when the child actors Rubina Ali, and Azharuddin, the slum urchins of Dharavi Slums, strutting on the red carpets at the Kodak theater hobnobbing and rubbing shoulders with the A listed Hollywood stars? An opportunity which many a 'B'ig Indian movie stars could not get in their entire life of work in the industry. Such a rags to riches has come to the little pair of uneducated, dirt poor kids. Believe me, the entire world media's attention will be focused on these two unlikely stars of Mumbai.As I have been following the dream run of this movie, i am beginning to believe that this indeed has to be written. Arindham and his ilk, in my opinion has got it all wrong. In all their eloquent diatribes and rants, masquerading behind a mistaken patriotism, they have been barking up the wrong tree. I hope come Sunday night, these detractors who dissed this movie, will have to eat their own dirt. What is funny is that some who trashed the binding element of destiny in the story line, are the ones who would look up to astrology, numerology, horoscopes, auspicious times and vastu sashtra!It is just not mere luck which chanced up on this genre defying movie, but real quality workmanship in almost all the departments. It is evident in the way it is winning awards in whatever forum or guilds it is reviewed, The work done in this movie is the envy of many other professionals in this industry the world over. They would die to get this sort of recognition.Take for example Resul Pookutty of kerala the sound engineer. I saw the movie for a second time to enjoy its technical brilliance. Resul has done a marvelous job. He has brought the real life sound and feel of the maximum city to the screen. I am sure he is going to walk away with the golden statue. As for ARR, I concede that his work in this movie is not as great as what he had done in some of his masterpieces for the Indian movies. His score in Lagaan and DevDas will surely stand the test of time. But those were done for a typical Indian consumption. But in SM he has really done a global cross over. Imagine a Hindi song getting an Oscar. The frantic editing, the wonderful screenplay and great direction from a master story teller have all added feather to its cap. A true accomplishment.Every movie pundit has predicted its win. The timing of this movie and the message of grit and hope it carries has resonated with the people world over who are weary of the world economic recession. It gives them the hope that not all is lost, things will become OK if you hang in there. Luck would favour you if you tread the straight path with perseverance. With a wind on its back and spring on its feet, Slumdog will walk into the California sunset with the sweep of the movie glory.In the movie when Jamal returns to the studio sets of Who Wants to be a Millionaire after the police interrogation for his 20 million rupee question, he runs into a poor lady at a traffic stop. On recognition it is Jamal she excitedly wishes him heartily.""Jamal, son is it you? You have my blessings, go win it all""That poor lady's wishes rings prophetic now. Tune into Sunday night's Oscars to witness Slumdog Millionaire make movie history.Destiny is already in the envelope, sealed. It is written. And my final answer is...Jai Ho.",Slumdog Millionaire

This is my first review, and even though i am an honors student at my high school, i don't feel like writing a never-ending novel as a movie review. Well, here goes: I do not think words can really describe this movie. it surely is nothing short of amazing. i stepped out of the theater no more than an hour ago and i'm still in the great mood that slumdog millionaire put me in. though it has a pretty happy ending, it is not cheesy. there is nothing cheesy about this movie. everything is astonishing and i wouldn't be able to pick out a flaw if i wanted to. the story line is so intriguing and the last 10 or so minutes are so intense. I applaud Danny Boyle and all the people that worked on slumdog millionaire for this amazing experience that deserves all 8 Oscars it won and is one of the best movies ever made. for a high school student, i have seen a lot of movies (i'm the movie freak according to my friends) and it takes a great movie to make my top 10, and this movie made my number 3 (behind the Dark Knight and Titanic). i don't care what types of movies you like, but everyone should see this movie. it is nothing short of greatness and will be not be forgotten. ~~~~~~~Whitney~~~~~~~",Slumdog Millionaire

Let's face it, awards are for the living and not for the dearly departed, and neither are they for the ones left behind. Don't think Heath really cares much anyway. Slumdog Millionaire, so much hype, so hype, so much regret that I even bothered, when it should really have gone straight to DVD, never mind TV. After all it's just the normal rags to riches story, this time plastered across an Indian background. Been there, seen that......big YAWN! While it was a good watch, the acting was static, and the question master extremely irritating! I was hoping the goons would get him eventually..... An amazing performance by the likes of Philip Seymore Hoffman and Meryl Streep go just about unnoticed. Has the Academy gone completely mad?? Well, here's to a lot more madness from Hollywood this year. Watch it and weep!",Slumdog Millionaire
1024,dogan_nida,An Unexpected Success,9,2 March 2009,"Slumdog Millionaire! Even its name is impressive, isn't it? At least I think so. It is one of the most wonderful movies that I have watched in recent years. Maybe it is the best. I guess many people think so. It totally deserves eight Oskar.The movie is set in India. Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) who is the leading man of it lives in a slum with his mother and brother Salim (Madhur Mittal). The movie begins with the query scene. Jamal is questioned by the police because he participates in "" Who wants to be a millionaire?"" and he answers all questions correctly up to the last question for big prize so the announcer supposes that Jamal cheats. He begins how he answers all questions correctly. The questions are relevant to his childhood. When each question is asked Jamal remembers his childhood and the movie consists of these memories.Jamal's character looks like ordinary case but he is unusual. Actually Money is not important for him. He participates in that contest to find his first and only love Latika. He is not self-centered and he just does not feel himself. Also he is brave and believes in destiny. His innocence is distant from the world's evil. Briefly, I think he is a different person.Another important character is Jamal's brother Salim Malik. He is older than Jamal. His personality is different from Jamal. This difference is vague in their childhood but as Salim grows up, he becomes self-centered. He takes away Latika from Jamal. Money is important for Salim, even just before he dies. That scene shows how money is important for him.Latika (Freida Pinto), Jamal's first and only love, has an important role in the movie. The love between Latika and Jamal makes the movie meaningful. Latika is a beautiful girl. Although she is well-intentioned, she is not as brave as Jamal. She is afraid of taking risk and she meets her fate calmly. But she ventures everything thanks to her love to Jamal. She deserves this love.I think this movie is wonderful in all aspects. Especially, it is same as real life because there is a real contest in it. this is an undeniable feature. Briefly, I admired this movie very much and while I was watching some scenes, I cried. It is a masterpiece.",Slumdog Millionaire
1025,flash_9,slumdog millionaire,10,4 March 2009,"The story of Jamal Malik, an 18 year-old orphan from the slums of Mumbai, who is about to experience the biggest day of his life.It describes the destiny of young Indian boy who grew up in Mumbai. He is a contestant on the Indian version of ""who wants to be a millionaire"".However he is a self confessed non-genius.Each chapter of his story reveals the key to the answer to one of the competitions questions.He finds the answers of the questions by chance,because of things that happened in his life such as the scenes of him obtaining Bachchan's photograph,the death of his mother,he and his brothers befriending Latika,his being around Tajmahal with his brother Salim, so Jamal Malik is tortured by the policemen in a precinct accused of cheating a game show because according to them it's impossible that a non-educated man who Works as serving tea(chai-wallah)in a call center is close to winning twenty million rupees in the show. The police inspector shows the videotape and after each question, , he begins to explain to the police how he knew each of the answers to avoid further torture. Jamal tells parts of his childhood with his brother Salim, his crush for Latika and their fight to survive on the streets to justify each correct answer, guided by his common sense and past experience, and prove his innocence. At the end of this film his brother Salim gives Latika his phone and the keys to his car and urges her to run away ,when Jamal answers the last question .Thanks to Salim ,Latika and Jamal meet.Besides, he wins the grand prize.It is then revealed that the correct answer to the opening question is : D)it is written.In this film revealing look into the Mumbai slum is just one of the beautiful and terrifying story lines.The very realistic and brutally true-to-life scenes involving the raids of Muslim sections of the slums by Hindus, and the luring of children to a life of begging on the streets (for gangsters and criminals) in exchange for accommodation and food are done in a manner that is both tastefully evocative of reality while fitting in tone with much of the rest of the film, which has a more hopeful tone.This film takes us on a journey to the height and depths of our souls.From the height of romantic altruism and unfathomable financial reward, to the depths of torture, murder rape, and extreme child abuse.Besides that love and destiny are the weapons to control the pace and the direction of the film.Besides,The romance scenes are either beautifully understated (most of the scenes with them as children/young teenagers, and a couple after that) or fantasy melodrama like much of the stuff near the end of the film.I personally think that it is very good.It is refreshing and engaging. This well-acted and well-directed film is the heart wrenching tale of a person who has everything ever loved taken away from him, only to try with everything that he has to regain his true love and gain more than he could ever hope.So ,It is realistic one which can easily effect our feelings or thoughts.""Slumdog Millionaire"" is, I suppose, a dramatic comedy at heart. But it is also much more. It is a film about friendship, gratitude, love, betrayal, poverty and hope. It makes you laugh, weep and cheer as you can't help but marvel at Boyle's sheer genius. This film has made me grateful to be alive.I think it should be seen because it is an excellent film with an excellent soundtrack which is one of the best of the year.It's funny, sad, thrilling, basically a very enjoyable film that deserves numerous Oscar nominations.",Slumdog Millionaire
1026,trblshooter,"No Slumming here, pure class....",10,25 February 2009,"Danny Boyle has been able to combine effortless style with a heart warming story, he has really stepped up his game with Slumdog. I felt like I was on a journey with Jamal, ultimately I found the film to be an uplifting experience, an inspiration not because of the money or fame it was more in spite of these elements. You don't get many movies that speak to you and I wasn't expecting the world when I saw it but I received so much.The imagery the Director uses to conjure the emotive explanations that form the movie's skeleton are really apt, he manages to tread the fine line between style and substance perfectly. The film easily fits into its 2 hour running time without much fat to speak of. The unknown talent are punching well above their weights and I found all of them to be excellent. The young Jamal and Salim form the backbone of the story with Latika as the love interest, this triangle of hope and determination is what the real story is about. Sacrifice plays a large part too and in these moment we find the real humanness in all three characters. 'Who wants to be a Millionaire' is a large part of the story but you leave the movie feeling that 'Millionaire' could have actually stayed at home in this wonderfully colorful, dynamic and sad portrayal of life in a slum. Throughout the movie I kept thinking that one day my kids should see this, just to appreciate their own lives and how lucky they are. Laaatiiika will forever ring in my subconscious. Excellent movie, go see it!",Slumdog Millionaire

Indians everybody know the Music Director AR Rahman Talent. as a Indian(especially as a chennai guy) i have been waiting from long back for this record to the rahman. i am very happy he got than now. but unfortunately this is not the best one from him. himself told that he worked for this movie only 3 weeks. they are so many films to portray his talent. In Action - Ayutha Eluthu Romantic - Alaipayuthey realistic - All Maniratnam directed movies. even there are so many Tamil language films are there to depicts the realistic. if you want to see the reality check the kamal's Nayagan.even you can see every movie of kamal hassan. if you want see the latest film check our great director bala's NAN KADAVUL. you can see the big difference for the same kind of story. and also check bala's assistant amir's PARUTHI VEERAN. I think,This film is directed by American. that is the only reason its got 8 Oscars. This is absolutely partiality from the Oscars judges.

Then from the question one, we know how will whole movie go and from that moment, honestly, I was just counting how many questions are left so I can get this movie over with. Also, questions in this quiz are silly easy, especially the last one which by no means should be a main prize question which can be answered by any average 10 years old kid. But still, I continue watching the movie , with a belief there has to be something original and unexpected as the movie gets near the end, having in mind how highly rated this movie is, but fair tale just keeps going on and on...

It is definitely not just another Indian movie, describing a story more realistic and full of meanings then any Bollywood footage could ever be. The frame story procedure keeps your imagination awake during the entire movie, even though they use classical motifs, such as the duality good brother/ bad brother, the extreme good luck of the main character or the changing of his condition from ""mendicant"" to ""prince"".

1033,cnr187,Overrated and somewhat cynical.,5,18 March 2009,"The whole idea of the movie is overblown to the point where you just can not believe the movie and the actors. Obviously the movie was made for western audience without any regard for the realism of the content. What we have at the end is quite fake portrait of Indian life. All that the makers of the movie had achieved is the overly emotional reaction from politcorrect and emotionally-needful western society. And I doubt that the emotion will be long lasting.Adding to that the movie is quite cynical in some parts. As In blind boy accepting 100 dollar bill or American tourists standing up for the boy.. etc. etc. This is just so fake and cynical.The only thing this move good for is making some clueless individual to sympathize with this ""out of the world"" Cindyrella story. What was the point of the movie? I did not get it. We already know that the life in India is hard.. what was the point of putting this ""spoon of sugar"" on the top of it. As if going through winning a million could make us see what hard life a person in Indea could go through.. And stockpiling full-house of stories definitely shows that this movie is more like 10 short tear-sapping stories.. cheap move from the director. Very fake. The Director work is doubtful at least.. the plot just does not connect in some parts.. -Why would a show host make police try this boy for truth??? Doesn't anybody know that these shows make money not from cheating their players out money but from placing advertisements of various commercial product..(obviously that was the move to overdramatise the plot) -Also if you going to rescue child prostitute from pedophile circle.. what are you gonna do about other poor girls? As if police in Indea are in it??? I doubt that. Well you get the idea of what kind of lies they are showing to us here.. complete fake.. ""pulled out by the hair out of a swamp"" sappy drama story.For me this movie was just a pile of cynical-selfmarketing-belowthebeltshot dung. Can not believe it got so many Oscars.. seriously do not understand for what.Taking tragedy-drama-story to the extremes doesn't always make a good point.

1035,james_hawthorne,Only good if you don't think about it.,3,31 March 2009,"I accept that I saw this film post-hype. It was never going to be the Citizen Kane that people seem to think it is. But cripes, it was fluff! Not only fluff, but cold fluff: while something like Mamma Mia can draw you in with its silliness and generous humour, I felt nothing but boredom at Dev Patel's constant grump. I didn't want him to get the girl.And, for all the talk about it being a 'love story against all the odds', the odds are so disparate as to be totally random! If you're going to write a fable, at least make your symbols coherent: is he fighting against discrimination because of his background? Is he fighting against people who use him? Or is he just fighting against his brother, who for some unknown reason is a really bad apple? (on that last point, this really annoyed me: i really don't buy his brother! If we agree its a moral fable, then what on earth does he represent?) Another massive problem with the film is the total lack of character development. So Dev Patel wants this girl... er, OK, why is this? It just seems to be a given. Can you imagine them having a happy life after the film? Can you imagine any of the characters doing ANYTHING outside the bubble of this plot? Can you say anything meaningful about the characters in the film that don't revolve around plot necessitudes? No? Well, maybe that's because these characters are about as undeveloped as your average goldfish.Basically, I accept that people will say that Slumdog isn't a heavyweight film; its a bit of romantic nonsense in an economic climate when we all need cheering up. OK then: watch Forrest Gump or Mamma Mia. Because they're far more warm and generous than this anti-social, individualistic film. The icing on the cake came at the climax of the film, when all the people of Mumbai watch Dev Patel win the show. Where did this community theme come from in a film which is ostensibly about this one kid fighting everyone else? Perhaps Boyle thought the only way to sell a film about India was to make it with lots of anonymous happy smiling people doing a dance. How very dated.",Slumdog Millionaire
1036,jglievano,Nothing Special,4,3 April 2009,The Who wants to be millionaire? theme wasn't necessary and it seems to me that it was included in the whole movie just to give it an unique approach that is not that unique after all. This movie is just another display of exaggerated social misery that may be true in the real world but in really extreme cases. This type of movies appear a lot in Latin American productions and they tend to show the same excessive social problems throwing out the worst of its society when it is actually very different in reality.I think this kinds of movies are meant to show the worst of certain cultures and their success are given by the misunderstanding or insufficient knowledge about these cultures' reality.,Slumdog Millionaire

Next thing you know I am going on websites and everybody was talking about this film and how great it was and everything like that. So i decided to go to the cinema and see it and what an amazing experience it was, truly mindblowing cinema, it reminded me so much of City of God. The fast camera movement, crazy camera angles, hand held sort of look, slow motion, split screen, texts appearing on the screen randomly, film clips being shown. The direction is truly mindblowing and the screenplay is fantastic. Simon Beaufoy did a great job of bringing Vikas Swarup's novel to life and even though quite a number of things are different from the book, the essential story structure, that of the game show providing a narrative device for switching between past and present was kept faithfully. Note to all filmmakers, this is how an adaptation is supposed to be done unlike Watchmen which i saw the other day which was very very average. The problem with that movie was that Snyder didn't realise that adapting a book to a film medium doesn't mean playing it safe and keeping everything in the novel , including all the dialogue and everything with no sense of direction and pacing and all that. That is why Boyle is a master of visuals and adaptation and Snyder is not. The acting is superbly impressive from the child actors to the teenage actors and Dev Patel is fantastic,also Anil Kapoor pulls off a difficult role, a sort of a role that is an unlikeable character but yet he manages to do a great job.

I am not saying this is a bad movie, not at all, it still remains a pretty good one with a not-so-usual scenario. However, it is not that extraordinary, and I totally disagree with the honors this movie got (hence my vote). So for those who hasn't seen Slumdog Millionaire yet and intend to watch it, my only advise would be : go and see it without being certain to see a masterpiece, and you will not be disappointed. (And keep in mind, in the real game, the questions are much more difficult!)",Slumdog Millionaire
1040,france-lmn,Just wonderful !!!,10,23 April 2009,"This film is one of the best Indian films I have ever seen! India makes something like 200 films a year and this one is the most realistic and interesting I have seen. The casting is not only Indian...Okay! But the kids who have the main roles in the slums have been chosen there! To begin with, the speed effects When the characters are running(Thanks to the digital camera) bring forth a superb explosion of lights and colors! I think that this film is more interesting to see with a big TV screen or at the cinema because the visual effects and the soundtrack are two of the things that make the film superb. The film shows how poor Indian people are but also how hopeful they can be. The plot looks like a fairy tale, with the baddies and the goodies and love story between the boy and the girl.Maybe for some people, sometimes the actions can be too unlikely, but that makes the interest of the plot. The Bollywood number at the end of the movie adds a touch of humor in the movie theater and I know that many people loved it. When you watch the film, you can guess that Danny Boyle has been very happy and motivated shooting it. All the characters and the soundtrack are Oscar-worthy. The movie deserves all the recognition it got. However, from my point of view there should be more explanations about how Jamal knew the answers : sometimes I understand the fact of his life, but not the reason why he remembers the exact answer. Except one or two details, this film is a masterpiece of Indian cinematography and a visual wonder. No problem : the plot is aimed at all people of all ages.",Slumdog Millionaire
1041,b-zyrtec,Good but not so exceptional,8,24 April 2009,"What a good movie! I really liked the plot and how the film is brimming with coincidence. OK, it might be a little far-fetched but that is what makes the story somehow magic. The way Danny Boyle brilliantly directed the film makes me look forward to watching other movies from him.Slumdog Millionaire showed interesting aspects of India, far from the clichés we often have in mind. However, I am not sure it deserved all its eight Oscars. if the film is a very good one, it is certainly not a masterpiece of the cinema history. As for the actors, I think Dev Patel and Freida Pinto acted both very well. The children were very good too. I have not read the book from which the film was written but it seems to be a good transcription. Well, to conclude with, if you have not seen Slumdog Millionaire yet, get out of your house, run into your car, pick up your girlfriend (can also be your boyfriend, friend, whoever) and drive to the nearest move theater as fast as you can. I promise you will have a great time.",Slumdog Millionaire
1042,lovesdaffodils74,Slumdog Millionaire,2,26 April 2009,"The story of an orphan, his brother and the girl they knew growing up in the slums of Mumbai in India won the Academy Award for Best Picture and numerous other Academy Awards. It earns it's ""R"" rating and is for adults and older teenagers only. The rags to riches story of Jamal is one that has been told over and over and could have been told without showing the violence and still would have had it's impact. The story would have been be just as good with a ""PG-13"" rating. You will sit through two hours of sickening violence before reaching the happy ending in this movie. I did appreciate the cinematography and some of the fine acting but that didn't make up for the fact that I wanted to vomit at times because of the violence and and couldn't fall asleep for hours after seeing the movie. I recommend skipping it. I was sorry I watched it.",Slumdog Millionaire
1043,lillbitever,You don't have to be a genius to have great knowledge,8,28 April 2009,"Jamal Malik, who is played by Dev Patel in the movie Slumdog Millionaire, is just one question away from wining a million rupees, on the popular game show Who Wants to be a Millionaire. A young man, who grew up in much hard times in Mumbai India, has just found himself in a tuff situation again, being one question away from becoming a millionaire. Jamal Malik, a former street child along with Salim played by Rubina Ali, and Latika, played by Freida Pinto has dealt with a lot growing up and is now faced with the opportunity of a life time, but what will happen? Though out the movie we understand what has happened to our young contestant. The movie opens with Jamal being interrogated by an Indian police officer, asking how he knew all the answers to the questions, because it seems unlikely for a slumdog to have the knowledge to win such a show. Is it because (A) he is cheating, (B) he is smart, (C) he is lucky, or (D) it is written. The Police inspector played by Irrfan Khan proceeds to review the show with Jamal, only to find out that for almost every question he has a life experience that has thought him the answer. We proceed to learn more about this young mans situation though a serious of flash backs he has while being interrogated. These flash backs show us details of his childhood which include scenes of the death of his mother during an anti-Muslim violence raid, how Salim becomes his big brother and the relationship that they have, and how Latika and Jamal become destined to be together. We get to see how the three of them struggled for food and money and how they went about obtaining such things. We gain an understanding of the relationship with Latika and the love that Jamal has for her. Slumdog Millionaire shows us that you do not have to be a genius to have great knowledge.Directed by Danny Boyle and written by Simon Beaufoy, this movie was an adaptation of the novel Q & A, by Indian author Vikas Swarup. It was set and filmed in India. The director use of color and lighting was extraordinary in this film. Bright colors showed some of the uniqueness of the film as well as the lighting. The lighting in the film gave an audience member an understanding of the situation and played well with the emotions of the film. One of my favorite uses of color was when Latika is standing within the train station trying to find Jamal and she is wearing a bright yellow head scarf which brings light to her.Often times we watch shows and wonder if we could do what that contestant is doing, never truly understanding what that person has gone though or how the came to know the answers. Slumdog Millionaire shows us that you don't have to be a genius to get everything that you want; just understanding what one has gone though can be an even greater life lesson.",Slumdog Millionaire
1044,alexandre-sarazin,Flawless,10,4 May 2009,"I find that even if there is a lot of violence and a lot of coincidences, this film is a masterpiece: it is the movie of the year.It shows the reality of the chaos in India but the happy end with the Bollywood scene, humour and heartbreak is like in a fairy tale. That is why there is an unlikely and an unrealistic part. And without all the coincidences (all the questions have a link with Jamal's life) We can not make the film. This movie is a visuual wonder to : It engrosses you in the story until the end and the music is wonderful but beyond the beauty of the pictures , the characters honesty hits you right in the face.Actors and actresses' performances are amazing.In conclusion the plot is good the way the film has been shot is genius and the actors are perfect the high number of reviews about SM shows the important impact of this film and that is why , it deserves all the recognition it got. This movie is a mixture of light and darkness and it is a family film with shocking brutality though. Contrasts make its originality and success.

Overall this was a bad try of making a movie of the quality of Cidade de deus.For Indians and Asians it is waste of time to watch this movie and others u will get a glimpse of making style of Indian movies.",Slumdog Millionaire
1046,themaeyu,Game Show Contestant Jamal Malik uses answers from the hardships of his life to win twenty million rupees and find the girl he lost years ago,9,4 May 2009,"When I popped the DVD Slumdog Millionaire (2009) into my DVD player I wasn't sure what I was expecting, but it sure wasn't this. What I saw was a very emotional, inspiring and message filled movie. Directors Danny Boyle and Loveleen Tanden certainly knew what they were doing when putting this cinematic feature together and credit is also due to the screen writer Simon Beaufoy. The theme is a mixture of the importance of love and perseverance in the harsh world we live in. You see the more harsh side of life that exists in every country but more just have turned a blind eye to it.The movie starts out with Jamal Malik, played by Dev Patel, being interrogated for being suspected of cheating on the popular game show ""Who Want to be a Millionaire?"" And the question is asked, ""Jamal Malik is just one question away from winning 20 million rupees. How did he do it? A. He cheated B. He's lucky C. He's a genius D. It is destiny"" After watching him being tortured for a bit he is placed in a chair in an office, where him and two officers watch the show and each question they ask him how he knew the answer. Each question brings back a memory from his life in the slums of India, some are good memories, but mostly there are sad ones.The shots used to transition from the present of him being questioned, to the show and then on to the flashbacks are brilliant. Through the television screen till you're on the state as one of the cameras filming the show, and from there you see him close his eyes in remembrance or gaze into the distance, you hear the sounds from the scene before the scene itself comes into focus. You are introduced to Jamal and his older brother Salim, played by Madhur Mittal as an adult, when they are little kids and are being played by Ayush Mahesh Khedekar (Jamal), Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail (Salim). They are the musketeers, causing mischief and trouble where ever they go in the slums, whether it's playing on landing strips and out running cops, or charging people to use bathrooms near the beach.During one of the flashbacks there is a fight and the boys' mother is killed. They find a little girl by the name of Latika, played as a child by Rubina Ali, alone and at first they outcast her on Salim's orders, but once Salim is asleep Jamal invites here in and befriends her. She becomes the third musketeer to their ranks. Latika and Jamal grow very close and even though they get separated as children he never forgets her. In fact he makes a point of going and finding her when they are teenagers, and finding her again when they were adults. He loves her more than anything and she's the reason he got on the game show, he knew she'd be watching it.The manipulation of time as they grow up makes the movie flow quite well and keeps the storyline going. When they transition from being kids to teenagers they are rolling down a hill after being thrown off a train. You see them slowly age through the flying dirty as they roll and yelp. Then when they sit up they are now teenagers and the Taj Mahal is standing before them in the distance. The next age jump from teenager to adult is a jump of time span. Years that went by where not much happened.As the movie nears its climax you see that Jamal has become a symbol to all 'slumdogs'. He made the show, he's answered every question correct and thousands of people gather around any television set that is available to them to watch this man, who has suffered much go from having nothing to having millions. When all he really wants in the end is to be with the girl he loves the most.I would most definitely say that this movie, through its capturing of the pain, the happiness, the sadness, earned all eight Oscars it won out of the ten it was nominated for. At the end I was moved by it. I was sitting right there with all the other Indians rooting for him to win, him to show that even a slumdog can know the answers, have knowledge, become some one and achieve something in the world. Then in the end, he achieves the only goal he's ever truly had: To be with Latika. Definitely earned a thumbs up from me for those who like inspirational movies that don't involve a lot of action but contain a lot of meaning. Life teaches us the answers to the questions we are asked. So the answer at the end is ""D. It is Destiny"".",Slumdog Millionaire

The film opens with an eye-opener scene: the main character, Jamal Al Malik, is tortured by the police because they suspects him of cheating in ""who wants to be a millionaire ?"". Slumdog Millionaire, by Danny Boyle, is based on a series of flashbacks. We can see in the film a series of flashbacks which show how Jamal can answer all the questions.

1051,tomythekat,A Hollywood story in India,5,17 August 2009,"Although the movie has a good dynamic, and is entertaining, it's just another Hollywood story in a foreign country. 1- I think that USA people goes to the cinema and watches a movie in English, and doesn't care about it (even if the characters are from another countries), but we see at that and we know it's fake, we don't believe the story. And this issue has been repeated all along Hollywood movies. 2- In my country, the kids that grow in slums, don't know how to read, write or even think properly. It's a poverty fact. And in this movie it isn't even justified why Jamal can solve all the questions. They could have make the Jamal Character as a kid that loved to read or who was brighter than his mates... but none of this is done in the story. 3- The Taj Mahal scene, is pathetic. How is a kid supposed to lie on the story of the Taj Mahal and the USA tourist just don't get it? Again it's an underestimation to the intelligence of the spectator. And i don't mention that the kid spoke perfect English (another hole in the story... how he did learn English?) 4- I agree with the comments that say that the final 1/3 of the movie is the justification to a Hollywood end. And the final dance... oh, unnecessary. 5- The story don't have a purpose or a message. I know that a lot of movies don't have it, but if the marketing says that is a realistic movie that shows how the people lives in the slums of Bombai, i expect something else.So, sorry for my English. I was somehow anxious because of the critics that this movie had, and the winning Oscar, and i'm very disappointed now. I think City of God is a real realistic movie.",Slumdog Millionaire

I can completely understand a foreigner being obsessed with the filth and the poverty -- I too was stunned by the plight of the homeless in New York -- of India. I thought Slumdog is brilliantly shot, and I am willing to forgive Ram dressed as a mix between Shiva and Krishna in a foreign film. But I do have a problem with a story that pretends to be real when in reality it is just a masala film -- the kind we churn out by the dozens in Bollywood.Yes, Slumdog Millionaire is just superficial fluff, mainly because of its gaping plot holes. It should have been much better researched...A R Rahman's music is good, but not the master's best. But -- maybe it's just me -- you never really feel for the adult Jamal. Maybe it has something to do with the acting."" Matthew Schneeberger- ""I found it impossible to feel emotionally invested with the main characters. All the way up to the final kiss, I truly did not care what happened to Jamal or to Latika. And I'm as sentimental and sappy as the next guy. It's just that this love story didn't work...Yes, despite what the most zealous of naysayers claim, India's problems are real and manifold: extreme poverty, communal violence, child beggary, painful vestiges of the caste system, to name a few. And all of these exist even in modern, urban India, the India of all those Western magazines profiles, the India of business process outsourcing and information technology....One of the first negative reviews of Slumdog I read was from the blog The Great Bong, who absolutely lacerated it. In it, the blogger wrote, ""Well yes these things do happen in India. However the problem is when you show every hellish thing possible all happening to the same person. Then it stretches reason and believability and just looks like you are packing in every negative thing that Westerners perceive about India for the sake of crowd pleasing."" He goes on to propose a film about an outlandish string of events happening to an African-American boy in the US, and says, ""Even though each of these incidents have actually happened in the United States of America, I would be accused of spinning a fantastic yarn that has no grounding in reality, that has no connection to the 'American experience' and my motivations would be questioned, no matter how cinematically spectacular I made my movie. At the very least, I wouldn't be on 94 percent on Tomatometer and a strong Oscar favorite."" He's right. Say an Indian director traveled to New Orleans for a few months to film a movie about Jamal Martin, an impoverished African American who lost his home in Hurricane Katrina, who once had a promising basketball career, but who -- following a drive-by shooting -- now walks with a permanent limp, whose father is in jail for selling drugs, whose mother is addicted to crack cocaine, whose younger sister was killed by gang-violence, whose brother was arrested by corrupt cops, whose first born child has sickle cell anemia, and so on. The movie would be widely panned and laughed out of theaters.That, to me, is Slumdog Millionaire: contrived, pretentious, absurd, hollow, inauthentic, a pseudo-statement about social justice. And yet today the film stands on the precipice of Hollywood's highest honor, the Academy Award for Best Picture.",Slumdog Millionaire

1059,thyt,Review of Slumdog Millionaire,8,23 February 2010,"Slumdog Millionaire, directed by Danny Boyle, is a gripping film which presents a cliché story with an excellent editing. The Indian co-director of the film helps the director to focus on the realities of India, which provides the audience not to escape from the effect of the film. All the actors and actresses are from India and main characters are the stars of Bollywood who had not been known by the rest of the world before the film. The story of the film tells the life story of a young Indian man struggling the difficulties of going up into a higher class. Furthermore, love, money and fate which are the cliché topics are presented in an original way.The film starts with a quiz show which changes the life standard of the Indian man who is uneducated person. He is arrested by the police because of the suspicion of cheating. However the flashbacks used during the film show that his bad life experience provides the knowledge of the answers of the questions. The story is supported by side stories which tell the love conflict, conflicts in the family and the conflicts in India. In the first half of the film the story flows faster than it does in the second half. Although the film slows down in the second half it continues to float the audience to the end. Through the end of the film it is inevitable to put yourself into the main characters. At the end of the film the Bollywood dance turns the excitement of the audience into happiness and puts a smile on their faces.The film, which has already proved itself by winning a lot of prestigious awards last year, is one of the best films of the year. In addition, it provides different varieties of emotions with fascinating music, scenes and natural acting of characters. Although it is a western film which is set in the East, the dance at the end of the film, which is common in Bollywood films, adds diversity to the film.",Slumdog Millionaire

This film includes love, hate and violence but still is a good film to watch if you want to feel good. Definitely worth an watch if you have not seen before Danny Boyle is a fantastic director who is also well known for other great films such as The Beach and Train Spotting. In this he uses scenes of the real slums of India to give a real feel to how life was like growing up for a ""slum dog"", this is the closest vision your going to get of growing up in India as your going to get other than watching an documentary.",Slumdog Millionaire
1061,harinin,winning by love and truth!,9,12 June 2010,"Slumdog Millionaire, is a well made movie. Fine camera work, background music, perfect acting and an excellent editing effort. The original novel must be well researched, thought of and written to make many of the tasks for the film maker easier.Now, I do not understand why there is so much debate regards to the movie, Oscar and the theme keeping in center, India 's poverty, slums and other flaws? I could see the movie as a refined theme of truth and various situations where any human being has to make choice between truth and lie, love and hate or inner voice and outer ruckus..The protagonist, Jamal faces various situations, starting from the moment where he and his brother lost everything, including mother, during hindu - Muslim riots and he had to choose to call a hindu girl whom he did not know much, to their shelter. And he chooses to give her shelter despite his brother reminding him of the hate between two communities. In fact the character of the girl is a metaphor for love and truth throughout the movie and life of Jamal. It is presented to him in various forms- pure, unexploited form in the beginning to exploited, manipulated, twisted, defaced, laden with threat etc forms and he, forever, chooses love while attending to his inner voice.The protagonist reaches to a height of his success keeping in focus his inner voice and his love for the girl, which is truth, honesty and symbol of true unconditioned love.The paradox is well shown between his brother and him. Both are ambitious, want money and material world. But choices and approaches are extreme. At the end both get what they aimed for, but one dies flooded in wealth and another mingles with life and joy despite of millions of rupees.Jamal repeatedly mentions during the police interrogation that he just answers the questions he is asked and there is no manipulation or a fraud. In fact he has answered all hard questions and difficulties in his life with honesty and inner voice. The quiz master is a metaphor for harsh realities of life or the people around. He asks difficult questions, ridicules his social background, makes cheap comments and is jealous of him succeeding all the way through his life, even to the extent that he misguides him at one point. He even tries to trap him in police net and eliminate him. But the natural way of answering all the questions of life and keeping in focus love and truth makes the protagonist of the film win through the most difficult situations. Even when apparently being helped by the quiz master, he may not be smart enough to judge the trick of the quizmaster. But he thinks of not winning by fraud and chooses another answer.While editing, the filmmakers have smartly used certain questions, like having answers -'satyamev jayate' and 'shri ram dhanush' where harsh truth is pinching and it is effectively shown that jingoism of 'satyamev jayate', even if not known by Jamal and being answered by public, does not change his course of life and just choosing the right path and love makes him triumph.So, my dear, the movie is not about the struggle of life as it is perceived commonly. But it is about making choices in life. A struggle in its ordinary meaning is an endeavor by a human being to firefight a difficult situation. In that there is much less to listen to the inner voice and making a right choice. So, this is not a routine struggle of a poor chap to fight through the harsh life, but it is a narration of a natural way of winning over just by love and truth.",Slumdog Millionaire

Jamal Malik and his brother Salim (Madur Mittal), grow up in India very poor and without parents from a young age. They struggle to survive and stay together throughout their whole lives. When Jamal becomes a contestant on the popular TV show when he was older, no one expected him to do well. After he started answering every question correctly, the producers began to think he might be cheating. He is arrested late one night after shooting by the show's security officers and held captive while being questioned about how he knows all the correct answers. They literally beat the answers out of Jamal, insisting that he is cheating somehow. How could a slum know so much? As Jamal begins to finally explain how he knows the answers, we are shown flashbacks of his young childhood. Each of these flashbacks provides different dramatic, horrific situations from Jamal's past, including being witnesses to their mother's brutal death, and how they are relevant to the questions on the show. We see Jamal and Salim overcome many terrible obstacles at very young ages, barely surviving at some points. They travel through India homeless at most times and earn money with their mischievous ways. A third orphan, Latika, played by Rubina Alina, and then Freida Pinto for the teenage years, joins the brothers and Jamal develops an immediate crush. Throughout the film Jamal and Latika are separated, but Jamal never forgets her. The answer to each question is somehow present in these childhood memories and Jamal remembers them as he is seating in the ""hot seat"", competing for millions of dollars.The film uses great cinematography with flashbacks and the music really helps set the mood for each scene. Jamal becomes the nation's hero and we see them all supporting him. This film grabs the attention of its viewers and holds on.",Slumdog Millionaire
1064,basilkenny,"EXcellent Movie, Good job",10,9 April 2011,"This is one of the best movies I have seen in 2008. Danny Boyle has done an excellent job with the cast. He has picked ordinary people from the streets of Mumbai with no acting experience and they have done an excellent job. I was born and brought up in Mumbai, so when I was first asked to see this movie I was a bit skeptical. Anyway this was the first week the movie was released in the US and apart from us just a handful of people watching the last show and we just loved it and personally I felt as if I was back home in Mumbai. Another interesting this was to see the reality portrayed in the slums of Mumbai. This is what Mumbai is all about, it may be disturbing to see some of the stuff but that's what the reality is. I think the movie would have been an even bigger hit if Amitabh Bachan had to play Anil Kapoor's role, he would have been the perfect person for that role. Bollywood loves to show the glamorous part of India, so for a movie to show this side of India I think is great. If I had to watch this movie another 10 times I would watch it and never get bored of it. Lastly, I think this movie deserves all the awards and recognitions. I would certainly give it a 10 on 10.",Slumdog Millionaire
1065,england_geek,Worthy of Best Picture...,9,25 February 2009,"Before watching this, I was thinking I wasn't going to like it that much, I am usually not a fan of the movie that is hands down favorite to win Best Picture because I am not impressed with the Academy and what they think is a Best Picture. An in a year where the two highest reviewed movies didn't even get nominated (Wall-E and The Dark Knight), I was really wary of Slumdog Millionaire.After watching this, I felt myself wanting to watch it again for a couple of reasons. I needed to see some of the things I missed, like some of the different interactions with Salim and Jamal, and how they in my opinion, hated one another, but couldn't stand to see something bad happen to the other, and that they needed each other to stay alive, especially when they were young.This is a great film, with a great cast of unknowns, great film direction, Danny Boyle really surprised me in this, having only seen 28 Days Later and Sunshine from him before, I didn't think he had it in him to create such a beautiful piece of art. Above everything else, it was the film's score and soundtrack that really blew me away. A R Rahman, in my opinion, has put out on the top 10 film scores of all time, with songs like ""O.. Saya"" and ""Jai Ho"", and even ""Liquid Dance"" gave it a Asian Metropolitan feel to it, everything fit, even on down to my personal favorite, but not created for the movie, ""Aaj Ki Raat"".I definitely recommend this movie for anyone who hasn't seen it, or is just thinking about it just because it won Best Picture.9/10",Slumdog Millionaire
1066,cnaujoks,SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE – a students' review (school project),8,7 December 2011,"IntroductionThe film ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is based on the book ""Question and Answers"" written by Vikas Swarup in 2005. The Hollywood production which mostly shot in India is directed by Danny Boyle in 2008 and is produced by Christian Colson. It is awarded with eight Oscars. The main actors are Dav Patel, Frieda Pinto, Madhur Mittal, Anil Kapoor and Irrfan Khan. By Saskia Röhl & Katharina HauschildSummary""Slumdog millionaire"" is a story about Jamal Malik who lives in the slums of Mumbai. He is an 18-year-old orphan and works as an assistant ""chai wallah"" in a call center. For that reason it seems unbelievable that he is just one question away from winning India's ""Who wants to be a millionaire?"". While whole India is sympathizing with him, Jamal answers question after question. However the police become suspicious and blame him for cheating so that they arrest him. Two police officers use methods of torture to get Jamal's confession. In the interrogation Jamal explains step by step how he could answer all these questions. Therefore he tells the police officers about his childhood which gave him so much experience with his older brother Salim and his lost first love Latika. This childhood is shown with flashbacks which are experiences to help Jamal answer the questions.By Anne Meyer & Liza SchroederWeaknesses""Slumdog Millionaire"", the winner of eight Oscars, contains only a few weaknesses we will show in the following. Understanding the first couple of scenes of the movie is difficult due to all the information in the different flashbacks. As a matter of fact the movie seems to be obscure and overwhelming at the same time. For example the present time of the movie takes place at the police station where the police officer questions Jamal's given answers in the show ""Who wants to be a Millionaire?"" This show is described in the first flashback. After that there is another flashback pointing to his childhood and adolescence. Aside from that ""Slumdog Millionaire"" reveals some typical aspects of a Bollywood production. For instance most of the action is foreseeable, especially the ending which, of course, is a happy one since the two lost lovers find each other again. Besides, after having watched the whole movie it becomes obvious that the last scene, the dance sequence, does not go together well with the rest. All the main and minor characters dance together to Bollywood music at the train station with everybody seeming to be cheerful as if they had forgotten all the dreadful things that had happened before. In the course of the movie this final represents a hard cut and somehow ruins the atmosphere of the whole movie.By Elisa Baeron &, Imke Klindworth",Slumdog Millionaire
1067,bell67,"""Slumdog Millionaire""",8,8 December 2011,"The film ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is a very dramatized film in which has a lot of twist and turns. The main actor, Jamal Malik (Dev Patel), is a boy who grew up in the slums of India with his brother Salim Malik (Madhur Mittal). They were able to withstand being run from their home, losing their mother at an early age, and also the brutal wickedness and ways that people tend to treat kids suffering from impoverishment. The story starts out with Jamal being a guest on India's version of ""Who Wants To Be a Millionaire"". He goes through a series of flashbacks that occurred throughout his life, explaining to the creator of the show how he was able to answer all of the questions correctly. The storyline of the film is really complex as it twists and turns and somehow still manages to focus on the theme of the film, finding true love and doing whatever is possible to obtain it. Latika (Freida Pinto), is a childhood girl that Jamal and Salim grew up with. Jamal is heavily attracted to Latika and stops at nothing to win her love. The camera angles in the film are really breathtaking as the images that are shot throughout the film gives you the feeling of really experiencing their life and cultural ways. In one scene, it shows Jamal and Salim overlooking the same community they were brought up in before being ran away. It shows a beautiful high shot picture of the two overlooking the whole city from above. I believe this is relevant to the theme because it helped Jamal to realize how much he missed Latika, and also for contributing to go upon the game show to see if it helps her to find his whereabouts. The lighting in the scenes definitely made the feeling more intense as in certain scenes of action the lighting got more dimmer and other scenes tend to brighten up as the scene slows down. The romance between Jamal and Latika wasn't shown very often, in which reminds me of ""Love And Basketball"", but you eventually could figure out the ending with Jamal and Latika together at last. I had a good overall feeling for the movie, and it was surprisingly good in my opinion. I do believe however, that it took quite a while to get started.",Slumdog Millionaire
1068,sandye_t,The theme of this film as a central insight is prejudice.,9,9 March 2012,"The movie Slumdog Millionaire is about a boy named Jamal. Jamal is the antagonist and main character of the movie; his role is played by Dev Patel. Jamal is an 18-year-old orphan who is a contestant in the Indian version of ""Who Wants to be a millionaire"". With one question left for him to answer correctly and win the game, Jamal is arrested under suspicion that he is cheating. The question here that the police, the hosts and the audience want to know is how a poor kid from the slums (streets) of Mumbai knows all the answers to these hard questions.The theme of this film as a central insight is prejudice. Jamal is prejudiced against because everyone assumes that because he is poor and is from the streets he is uneducated. This film shows us that no matter the challenges and defeats he encounters, Jamal attains his objectives.As Jamal tries to answers the questions asked by the investigators, stages of his life are recounted using flashbacks; these flashbacks reveal the events that shaped Jamal's live and made him able to answer the ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"" questions. This film will give you all kind of emotions. There are moments when you will be sad, moments when you will laugh because even thought the film depicts scenes of sorrow and provides visuals of poverty and violence, some scenes are funny. The acting was phenomenal as the characters were believable. One of the techniques used in this film is the lighting; some are natural and some are low-key. The low- key lighting is used when Jamal is first shown in the interrogation room with the police officer in the opening scene. The use of low- key lighting heightens the viewers' suspense and creates a somber mood; this lightening also connotes that Jamal is frightened. In the same scene close up camera shots are used. Motifs are also used; in the film, the scene where money is being scattered is repeated. The movie was awesome with great pictures and excellent music. It is very touching and emotional; some of the images are very disturbing.",Slumdog Millionaire

Are there really dead bodies in the water? And do people really bath in the same water? Do people really walk barefoot on the streets, and it don't matter what they are stepping into?

1071,lisazug,An imperfect gem,8,5 November 2008,"What a fun movie this was! The images are lush with the color and grit of a poverty-stricken Mumbai, India. The overall structure of the film was refreshing -- our hero, Jamal, has been accused of cheating on the popular show ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire."" Having grown up an uneducated, homeless, orphan the police find it hard to believe he could possibly answer so many obscure trivia questions correctly. Jamal claims that his life experience taught him lessons that, at least in the context of the chosen game show questions, served him as well as a formal education. The police inspector has a video of the show and as Jamal explains question by question how he knew the answers... the audience learns the story of his life through flashbacks.The film vibrates off the screen with a texture and realism that could only be captured on- location in India. I've never been to south Asia, but a couple years ago I saw a film about a group of impoverished Indian children called ""Born Into Brothels,"" which won the Oscar that year for Best Documentary. The documentary was shot on video and revealed a world unlike anything I'd ever seen before. ""Slum Dog Millionaire"" is pure fiction, but Boyle and company have truly captured the vibrancy, the movement, and the indelible hope that can be seen reflected in the eyes of children growing up in destitute poverty the world over.The youngsters who play Jamal, his brother Salim, and Latika (Jamal's childhood sweetheart) are some of the best child performances I've ever seen on film. The child who plays the youngest incarnation of Jamal is nothing short of a miracle in my opinion. Even more surprising is the revelation that these kids are not actors, but were plucked from slums not unlike the ones depicted in the film. The best part of the film are the flashback sequences-- they have a life of their own thanks to some incredible cinematography, a pulsating soundtrack, funny writing, and great performances. The game show sequences do their job, despite being over-simplified -- Anil Kapoor, who plays a mean-spirited Meredith Viera, slithers through his scenes with slimy finesse. He's even able to pull off a ridiculous scene in a bathroom where his character tries to manipulate Jamal. I just found it distracting that this opportunity would even present itself. But that's just me.As for the latter part of the film, it fails to live up to the promise of the beginning. The weakest part is a love story that seems oddly forced/clichéd given the other strengths of the storyline. I suppose it's not really an Indian film if it's not about love, but from the start this film seemed to be about the relationship between the two brothers. I couldn't help but feel like there was some opportunity lost to tell a different, more interesting story there. Dev Patel (from the terrific BBC show ""Skins"") plays the oldest Jamal and does a solid job. His appealing innocence is what makes us care about him from the first moment we see him. Unfortunately by the end, it's that same innocence that makes it hard to buy that he experienced the difficult life that's been revealed to us over the course of the movie. The beautiful Frieda Pinto (who plays the oldest incarnation of Latika) has a similar problem. She's given even less acting to do, but pulls off the damsel in distress role as well as anybody. The ending falls flat in a final game show sequence that is notable for it's complete lack of suspense. We have a trivia question the western audience knows the answer to, and the wrapping up of a storyline that we see coming from 30 minutes away. In the final 15 minutes, things are unraveling quickly, and yet Boyle saves the ending by doing away with the predictable ""guy gets rich, gets girl, and drives off into the sunset"" motif. Instead Boyle keeps it simple and stays true to the world he did such an impeccable job creating. And to seal the deal? A marvelous Bollywood dance send up during the ending credits. This ending sequence is so much fun and leaves us, not thinking about the film's shortcomings, but rather with the memory of all there is to LOVE about this movie: Energy, color, and optimism in the midst of very harsh world.",Slumdog Millionaire
1072,surbhirihal,Slumdog Millionaire,9,12 June 2012,"Slumdog MillionaireSlumdog Millionaire, a movie which is an adaptation of the book Q&A by Vikas Swarup, was directed by Danny Boyle and Loveleen Tandan. Furthermore the screenplay was done by Simon Beaufoy.The leading roles are played by: Dev Patel (Jamal Malik), Freida Pinto (Latika) and Madhur Mittal (Salim Malik).Slumdog Millionaire is a story about the life and struggle of a 18 year old boy, Jamal Malik. He is just one question away from winning 20 million rupees on an Indian TV-show called ""who wants to be a millionaire"") Nobody ever came so close to actually winning that amount of money, so therefore he got arrested before he had the chance to answer the last question. The police and show crew suspected him of cheating during the game, how would a kid from the slums have all the answers otherwise? Mumbai's police sergeant Srinivas interrogates and tortures Jamal. With the evidence that he had no formal education and was a thief in his younger years the sergeant is determined to use any method to find out how Jamal got the information needed to come so close to winning. Each chapter of the movie reveals information by the use of flashbacks on each individual question about how he knew the answer to each of them. During all these layers of his past you keep finding out more about where his motivation for the show lies in, a young girl he met when he was a little kid back in the slums called Latika. Whom Jamal still loved after ""losing"" her several times, he hoped the TV-show would make her come back to find him.We found the movie stunning. The use of light and music in the movie really helped bring forth the emotion in the film. For example, the color yellow was used a lot, as a cultural reference, but also to contrast or enlighten the mood in scenes. The techniques they used such as silhouettes, color contrast, artificial and natural lighting, they were all done very well, and to full advantage. They gave the viewer the feeling they were actually in India, together with the characters, and made the story even more believable. The use of music in the movie also played an important role in creating the scene. The use of fading in and out at the right moments was done very well, in our opinion. Sometimes however, the music, although describing the scene well, could cause some chaos on screen, and made what the people were saying difficult to understand.Slumdog millionaire deals with very serious topics such as: child trafficking, poverty prostitution and civil war but still it is a very energetic and positive film. We see many great scenes in the film were Jamal, although an orphan with many troubles still makes the best of every situation. For example there is a very moving scene where we watch two children run through the streets of Mumbai. Anthony Dod Mantle does a tremendous job on the camera-work in not only this scene but throughout the whole film. Not only the camera-work but also the use of lighting and music make this film very entertaining to watch. The bright vivid colors bring out the cultural elements of India and drag the audience right into the setting. The story of Jamal is told in three different kinds of story- perspectives. One is where Jamal is participating the quiz and mostly Jamal and the presenter of 'Who want to be a millionaire?'' are speaking. Another is when Jamal is being interrogated by the police and the last perspective is the view from his flashbacks. This might sound a little chaotic but that is not the case since the editing is done wonderfully. The effect of having these perspectives is that it grabs the attention of the viewer and makes the audience curious. We get to see some beautiful shots of Mumbai during the flashbacks as well, which is a perfect setting for this film because it handles with all the topics mentioned earlier. The acting in the film was very realistic and the actors did a very good job. Anil Kapoor, a well-known name in the Indian film industry, played the part of the arrogant host of the show. Besides his arrogance he still wins over the viewer with his charms just like he wins over the audience in the show during the movie. British actor, Dev Patel plays the innocent tea-serving boy character of Jamal just as convincing. The scenes during the show these two characters contrast each other personalities very well and contribute to the success of this film. Boyle contrasts the sometimes too cheesy romantic scenes, which occur in a lot of Bollywoodfilms with a lot of realistic and striking elements. We think that is what made the film so successful; it has a perfect formula of romantic and dramatic moments. In conclusion the movie was a very great success, most of the scenes contained images about the life in India which most viewers in the western world would find hard to imagine. This concept was pretty new to the film industry and it turned out pretty well as this became a huge blockbuster in the year of release. The use of flashbacks made this movie a lot more interesting to watch instead of using the chronological ""method."" Driven by fantastic energy and a torrent of vivid images of India old and new, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is a blast. Simon Beaufoy's intricate and cleverly structured script, Chris Dickens' impressive editing skills and the whole art department crew contributed a lot to this huge hit.",Slumdog Millionaire
1073,jakedilucia,A Wonderfully Stylistic Love Story,8,26 December 2008,"Danny Boyle has proved himself again and again as one of the most powerful men behind a camera. If Danny comes in contact with a fantastic script, the end result is nothing less than a masterpiece. Slumdog Millionaire is just that, a beautiful blend of visual style and fantastic story.The story is a wonderful puzzle. We follow the troubled life of protagonist Jamal, who is trying to prove that it was fate that he would do so well on a Hindi version of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"", and not that he cheated.The film is told in a series of flashbacks and stories from Jamal's life. The questions on the game show relate to event that he has experienced, which executes the theme fate that is present throughout. ""It is written"". The events are often very tragic, sometimes comical, but always interesting. There is a great deal of tension in this film that keeps you glued to the screen.Often times, telling a story through flashbacks can be disorienting and even take a viewer out of the action. But with Slumdog Millionaire I found myself in a trance; captivated by the events and life of Jamal. I cannot stress enough how beautifully written the script was.Perhaps the most impressive aspect, however, is the beautiful style executed by Boyle and the camera crew. The cinematographer didn't hold back at all, and some of the shots in the film will take your breath away. Important and impressive compositions were frequent in Slumdog (not unlike a Spike Lee film, or something shot by Gregg Toland of Citizen Kane) and really marvelously mixed the modern edgy look with classic camera work.I give this film an 8.5 out of 10. I want to give it a 10, but that might because I'm still sort of 'high' from just recently experiencing it.Go see this movie.",Slumdog Millionaire

1075,bradydanger,Slumdog Millionaire Helps Redefine Romance in Cinema,8,17 December 2008,"The film Slumdog Millionaire is the latest feature film for the incredibly versatile director Danny Boyle (Trainspotting, 28 Days Later, Millions). In this film Boyle goes into the heart of Mumbai, India, as well as the game show ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" Through this he shows the story of a young boy, Jamal (played very well by the newcomer Dev Patel), growing up in the slums and his undying love for the girl of his dreams, his childhood friend Latika (played by the incredibly beautiful Frieda Pinto). At the film's onset we are immediately thrust into the crowded and fast paced slums through the beautiful directing of Boyle. He shows a young Jamal, along with his brother Salem and their cohorts, antagonizing a cop as he chases them through the streets. This scene plays out to Indian music and gives a true sense of what the slums entail. At the conclusion of the scene the camera goes through a series shots backing further and further up to show the true enormity of the slums. Through this it is clear that Boyle's directing would be the true marvel of the film The film simultaneously shows the upbringing of Jamal and his battle to prove his validity of winning the show ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" Jamal was accused of cheating on the show and needs to justify his answers to an investigative cop. It is shown that every question Jamal answered correctly on the show somehow correlated with an important event in his life. This is the unique part of the screenplay, because the story of Jamal's life and the investigation play out simultaneously. At times scripts such as this can become gimmicky and irrelevant to the plot. However, Slumdog Millionaire¸ does not suffer from this. The back and forth storytelling of the game show and the Jamal's upbringing helps us not only identify with Jamal as young man growing up in the slums, but also shows the importance of his present situation. The culmination of his life leads to the game show and it is clear that nothing is more important to Jamal than his present state. Through this style of the story telling, duality becomes a major theme in the film, the duality between the past and the present, the duality between the rich and the slums, the duality between love and money and duality between good and bad, which is showed through Jamal and his brother. While none of these are answered, the dichotomy of the each is presented and put in front of us as the viewer. It is through the themes of the film truly resonates. This unique screenplay couples perfectly with Boyle's directing. By making the film in this way it allows for duality to be stressed at every moment of the film. We are able to compare Jamal on the game show, to Jamal that grew up in the slums. Along with that, we are able to witness his motives for being on the game show. It becomes clear through the development of both his upbringing and his interrogation that the idea of the money actually matters very little to him. This allows Boyle to work within his full range of capabilities, because of his very scattered past of movies he is able to perfectly developed both equally important stories effective while also simultaneously. Ultimately it becomes clear through this plot device that the Jamal's motives are to impress the girl that he met in his childhood, that he loves. Throughout Jamal's life he crosses paths with Latika several times. Through these encounters Jamal finds out that Latika loves the show ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" This is his main objective for getting on the show. It is clear that Jamal would do anything for Latika and the prize money from the show matters very little in comparison to the pursuit of love, and in turn Latika. The film concludes beautifully as Jamal must give the final answer and hope that his efforts will eventually lead him to her. Slumdog Millionaire is a beautiful and uplifting film that should be required of anyone that enjoys romance in cinema. It doesn't reinforce the same ideals we have become accustomed to seeing in typical romance films, it gives a new type of story of undying love. It is not sappy it is real. The passion of Jamal could be relatable to anyone who has been in love. Through Danny Boyle's camera the essence of the slums in Mumbai are masterfully captured while he also develops a cast of memorable characters. The film will certainly be up numerous awards in the upcoming season and should not be missed.",Slumdog Millionaire

I've always disliked the Batman movies, I actually hate the character! but this movie was clearly the years best. Look at the reviews across any of the movie databases, how can it be denied a best picture nomination? This years other nominations are heavy on performances & lacking story/direction or just too depressing to to be considered a contender by the Oscars. The Oscars decided the world needed a feel good movie in the face of the global economic problems and this was also a way to give Bollywood a small slice of the recognition its been robbed of for years. Sadly, no other movie stood a chance amidst the hype Hollywood heaped upon this movie, a movie which was supposed to go straight to DVD!!!!

1079,Elf-cnr,My review,10,12 March 2013,"İ think so its a kind of movie which is telling us truth stories and poetic justice. The boy survived alone his hole life and finally he reach happiness ( his love and money ) alone himself and the God's help. His all memories help him in every question and he finished this competitive. This movie lighted some truths in our lives like when somebody shoot him, American tourist saw that and helped him. He just said this is words : it is real India, it is not like told stories and he point out many poor and alone children are living like this bad conditions and they need help. So it is a kind of dramatic movie which is telling us some happening facts. This movie show us a slumdog can be millionaire if some memories help him.",Slumdog Millionaire
1080,user-705-335707,Slumdog Millionaire Must-See Movie!,8,6 June 2013,"'Best movie of 2008', 'An intoxicating mix of genres: comedy, drama and suspense' and 'A gaudy, gorgeous rush of color, sound and motion. These are only a few of the thousands positive quotes which are used to describe 'Slumdog Millionaire'. Everyone was so excited about the movie that we had to see it. After watching the movie we immediately understood the fuss about it. The colorful vivid images make you instantly feel happy. The movie features rough stuff like child prostitution and poverty, but at the same time it's full of warmth and always looks to the bright side of life. Although it's not the first movie about the game show 'Who wants to be a millionaire' the plot line of the movie is very unique. The movie is based on the books Q&A written by Vikas Swarup and keeps you captivated till the end. Danny Boyle did a great job creating this movie and I'm sure we can expect more successful movies in the future.Danny Boyle certainly succeeded in making a successful movie with the actors he chose. The actors with no popularities and with only a small past experience of acting were very convincing. This might be due the fact that real slum kids were used in the movie, these kids could just play themselves in their daily life. In general, the acting was fine but not outstanding. Sometimes you could notice Patel slipping back to his British accent. If I wouldn't know any better I would think Patel had already played in several movies. It was a great choice to take pretty unknown actors so you wouldn't have too high expectation in advance. So that in the end, you would be even more surprised. Another great thing they did was the casting, from little children (e.g. Jamal) to teens and finally to young adults. Even though they weren't played by the same actor it felt like they grew up in the movie. It's no wonder Slumdog Millionaire won multiple awards even with strong competitors like 'The Dark Knight' and 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button'. The lights and colors are pleasing the eyes while watching. Anthony Dod Mantle did the cinematography and it was not the first time he won an award. He soaked up the colors, people and places of India and put them in the movie. Most of the time he used a compact digital cameras to move with speed through the slums. Throughout one of the scenes warm colors such as red, yellow and cold are used. This is done to exaggerate Jamals 'dream' and to show the humid climate of India. Especially the cinematography during the childhood flashbacks and the 'dreaming' scenes were really well done. However, this movie could have showed us the developments taking place in India instead of only showing their weaknesses. This might give you a superficial idea of the society. But it did contribute to all the drama in the movie. Much of the story is told in flashbacks, but this is done very smoothly.As we all know, the biggest movie-industry is the Indian Bollywood industry. There are a lot of Bollywood movies made and they are very popular nowadays. Slumdog millionaire is no Bollywood movie, but there are some elements of Bollywood in the movie. For example, at the beginning of the movie children from the slums get chased by policeman. Danny Boyle got his inspiration for this scene from the Bollywood-movie ""Black Friday"". He was also inspired by the Bollywood-movie ""Parinda"". Both movies are namely about two absolutely different brothers that get into conflict with each other. One of the brothers also plays the show- host in Slumdog Millionaire. These Bollywood elements make the movie even more interesting for us and the rest of the world to watch. So it was very clever of Danny Boyle to insert some elements of a typical Bollywood movie in Slumdog Millionaire. This namely made the movie even more popular throughout the whole world. A.R. Rahman, the music producer, was aiming to mix old India with modern India. The music was one of the parts that I liked the most about the movie. He won several prices for the music in Slumdog Millionaire including two academy awards, two Grammies, a golden globe and more. Rahman also composed the soundtrack J'ai ho, a Bollywood dance number. The music in the movie really enlarged the emotions and things happening. All in all we can say that the movie makes you instantly feel happy. The colorful, inspiring shots make you want to visit Mumbai. I won't recommend Slumdog Millionaire to small children, there are some disturbing images. Because of all the optimism, you might forget about the orphans, poverty, and police brutality. Though, this is also shown in a very realistic way in the movie. It's an excellent movie for (young) adults, because it's a mix of everything you want in a movie; it's realistic, the actors are well-chosen, the story is exciting and gripping, there is some romance and the story is unique. So if you haven't seen Slumdog millionaire yet run to the video store and go watch it!",Slumdog Millionaire

While I really enjoyed the movie, as a movie, in my opinion, it was very formulaic. The boys born in a bad situation, mother dies, they are on the street, one goes bad, the other good, the girl wants to be good, but can't because of the circumstance. Good boy works hard and makes it, the bad boy excels at being bad, except in the very end when he does the one thing to redeem himself. And the boy and girl live happily ever after.

1086,merghanis-project,slumdog,10,1 April 2014,"Merghani Elboshra Plot SummarySlumdog Millionaire tells the story of a young man named Jamal Malik from Mumbai, India whose challenges and life lessons he has undergone have helped him gain the right amount of knowledge which came come to his benefit when he goes on the show, ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire!"" As the show progresses, he is only a question away from winning the grand prize of 20 million Indian rupees. The question was to be saved for another day after the show. Unfortunately, he is suspected of cheating on the questions and is arrested immediately outside of the television studio. He is tortured, electrocuted, and physically assaulted until he confesses that he was cheating(the torture was to force him into confessing about something he did not do); from that point on, the story goes on to show flash backs of his life experiences and scenarios which ironically gave him the knowledge relating to the questions on the show. World ReligionThis movie in itself describes the type of issues that are faced by many individuals who fall into the lower part of the caste system within Indian society. Jamal is an individual who was born into poverty and inhabited the slums of India with his mother and his brother, Salim. Individuals who lived in such conditions are referred to as Dalits or the untouchables. Since Jamal and his family were Muslims, they were not prohibited from the consumption of meat such as beef and chicken. The Hindu caste system tends to categorize individuals who do participate in the consumption of such flesh as untouchables because of the fact that such consumption is looked down upon in Hindu beliefs and principles. Jamal and his family also lived in the slums and usually individuals born in such conditions and who are also born in this social class is believed by Hindu society to not have the ability to move up within the caste system. They are viewed as people who are incapable of achieving the same amount of prominence and success as people higher up within the caste system. The untouchables, being of poor economic influence, also lack access to higher level education systems. Therefore Jamal's success within the game show and his ability to make it so far to the point in which he is only one question away from winning the big prize seemed unbelievable and incited great amounts of suspicion among the officials and law enforcement. They felt that a person of that low of the class should not possess such factual knowledge; therefore they stereotyped him and arrested him and also suspected him of cheating. Overall, the issues faced by Jamal were a based on of his place of birth and economic status. His ability to defy the caste system made it an issue for Hindu society. They felt that the only way for him to succeed was if he was cheating.",Slumdog Millionaire
1087,tanya-wolffenbuttel,This film tells us in a series of flashbacks the exciting biography of the life of a young man called Jamal.,8,10 June 2014,"A slumdog turns into a millionaireThe film 'Slumdog Millionaire' is an exciting biography of the life of a young man named Jamal and his brother Salim. Their mother was killed during an attack on their slum by a Buddhist group from another slum. The father of these boys is out of the picture, so the two brothers have to take care of each other. The story starts with Jamal who enters a quiz show, not with the intention of actually winning the money, but in the hope that Latika, his big love, is watching. Jamal knows almost all the answers to the questions he is being asked in the quiz show by an experience he has made in his past. The flashbacks very well tell us the story of Jamal's terrible youth.Slumdog millionaire is a thought-provoking and memorable movie. Sometimes it is rather difficult to catch the speeding plot. Nevertheless, the movie still gives a very interesting experience. In the movie, many things happen after another. When the main character tries to find a resolution to the questions, lots of emotions and knowledge is being released to the viewer. Lots of memories surpass one another. Therefore it takes a lot of concentration and thinking to understand the movie. Furthermore, it is rather a plus point that the producers placed the film in a kind of action, drama and romance genre. Doing so, it made the movie enjoyable for both genders and almost all ages. There are a few exclusive scenes which may be too aggressive for little children. One of such scenes is when a child kidnapper blinds children by pouring acidic substances into the children's eye sockets. Nevertheless, combining different genres can be, in some aspects, very useful because it makes the movie stand out of all the others. There are scenes that contain resentment, fright, love and action. The different moods have been cleverly combined, which makes it easy for the viewer to understand the outline of the movie. In the scene where the main character's mother dies you can sense the children's fright and you can seemingly see the action that follows. Flashbacks make the movie more enticing. In the film there are many situations where his memories pass by. Each of these flashbacks gives the viewer a frisson, a brief moment of emotional excitement. An example of that would have been right at the climax of the film, when action and love cross paths. The main character's brother sacrifices himself for the escape of his brother's love. Now that the two love birds have been reunified, the movie tops with a happy ending. First of all, the director said in an interview that the colour yellow is almost always being worn by Latika, because it is the resemblance of hope and positivity. In my opinion this worked out quite well, it's not too obvious yet present. Since yellow is an extremely bright and eye- catching colour you immediately notice Latika when she's present in a scene. However, there may be said that she doesn't always wear yellow. Although this statement is true, there is another explanation for that. When she wears cream, the colour cream symbolises the hope and positivity being bleached out of her soul just as her clothes. She's feeling quite depressed in this stage of the movie because she is being semi- imprisoned by Salim. Therefore you can say that colour is part of the movie. I think that the yellow aspect is only really noticeable when you take a deeper look into the movie. Thereby there has also been made use of saturation, for example when Salim and Jamal are in their shelter for the rain after the attack, because Jamal sees Latika and the intensity of the colours is very low. This low intensity makes the audience feel quite sad. However, contrary to this, there has been made use of a very high intensity at the last scene at the train station when Jamal sees Latika again. Those bright colours made the mood very happy. Nonetheless, there has been made use of more types of techniques. One of them is chiaroscuro, the difference between light and shade adds a lot of tension and emphasises the emotions. One of the many examples of this technique is when Jamal calls Latika during the show. In the film there is one shot in particular which combines three-point lighting with natural and artificial light and with those two combined, there is a shot which is partially inside and partially outside. So to conclude it all, colour and light play a big role in this film and therefore cannot be underestimated. I also believe that the natural light makes the scenes look more realistic and this makes the life in the slums, as being portrayed in this movie, more reliable. Also because these shots are actually taken in the slums and not in a studio. The movie fulfils all the viewer's desires. The most enjoyable parts are full of emotion and thrill, such as the parts where Jamal is being chased or when he sees his love again. The movie seems to be enjoyable for male and female and for many different age categories. The movie is very exciting and enjoyable. I do recommend watching this movie, as it simply doesn't get boring. Light and colour have been combined splendidly, and provokes the mood and atmosphere of the entire movie. The movie picks the viewer up, puts them back down and leaves them full of frisson, excitement and joy.",Slumdog Millionaire

However, the viewer soon finds out that the answer to the question posed to them at the beginning of the film is more complicated. One of the officers ask him how he knew the answers to the some first questions he was asked on the game show, and suddenly the audience is transported back in time when Jamal was little boy. Here we find that the answers to the game show questions are interwoven into the story of his life, like it was his destiny to know the answers from the beginning.

Perhaps the materials are so familiar to me that I don't find the movie surprising or consider it the best. No doubt, it is a good movie that you should not miss.

1091,peter-1158,The best movie I've seen for a very long time,9,24 February 2009,"I went to see this movie with not a little nervous anticipation. I had read mixed reviews, some loathing Danny Boyle's latest offering, some praising it to the skies. I came out of the cinema today blown away. I'm very hard to please (it's my age I think!) but I was immensely and pleasantly surprised at what I had experienced. This movie is superb on so many levels - the score is top notch; the cinematography glorious; the casting excellent; the script witty, funny, tragic, emotive; the pace and direction perfect; the camera-work inventive without being obtrusive; the premise beautiful in its simplicity. The idea of a 'slum-dog' getting on a money show, knowing the answers thus raising suspicion, but demonstrating through his sad and tragic life experiences how he happened to be able to answer correctly, works extremely well. I agree with a number of reviewers that the first half is the best as it follows the very young Jamal, Salim his brother, and Latika the girl they befriend, in their adventures. You laugh at their joys and cry at their tragedies. These slum-dog children suck you into their lives so that you are constantly engaged. The second half isn't bad, it's very, very good, just not quite as good. Yes, things may seem just a little bit contrived in places but not in a spoiling way. And the love interest is perfectly handled so that it's not saccharine sweet but very touching - I just knew Jamal was going to kiss that scar at the end! For those who may be concerned about talk of the torture scenes and violence, this is not a lightweight feel good movie but gritty and disturbing. It is not a family film i.e. for children under 15. However, to me none of the violence was gratuitous but served the story, and yes, there's some bad language but again nothing OTT. Danny Boyle you and your superb cast and back up team really deserved those Oscars for what is a true cinematic tour de force! (And only 14m smackers too)",Slumdog Millionaire
1092,alexxs-97,Brilliant !,9,4 February 2015,"The movie version of "" Slumdog Millionaire"", directed by Donny Boyle and published in 2008, tells the outstanding story of the young Jamal Malik, an orphan from the slums of Mumbai, who attends the Indian version of the gaming show 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire', because of a much greater purpose than financial wealth.It begins immediately with the main event, which is introduced by a black screen and a question towards the viewer, that lasts during the whole play and is answered in the end. Jamal is only one answer away from 20 million rupees when the setting changes and the viewer finds him in interrogation, because be is suspected of cheating. To convince the police of the opposite, Jamal starts to enumerate various occurrences in his life, which all lead him to the knowledge he is able to answer the questions with. The film is basically a flashback of Jamal's past and long journey. It introduces the reader into the world of modern India and allows to fully enjoy taking part in it. Even though the movie plot shows many differences compared to Vikas Swarup's novel, as for instance the change of the name of the protagonists and his relationships with other characters, this film still manages to convince with fantastic role play, wisely chosen cinematic devices and a breathtaking storyline. Not to forget to mention 'Slumdog millionaire' is an multiple academy award winner and earned 377.9 Mio $ at the Box office.In my opinion this masterpiece is definitely worth watching!

The movie 2/3 of the way through had me thinking that it might be the best movie I've ever seen, and I've seen a ton of movies. In the final 1/3 of the movie they make the love story between Jamal and Latika the main focus of the ending. Instead of telling more epic and captivating stories about how jamal and Salim are beating all odds, they literally make everything about latika in the end. Everything. The only reason he goes on the show is for latika. We mostly see salim at the end because hes helping latika escape.

Wanna see a real good movie about slums? Watch ""City of God""!

Where ""Q & A"" was insightful and clever, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is far less so. I can partially understand why switching the focus of the novel was necessary - and in the process creating a film that wants to have a faux-Bollywood narrative, but ultimately it left me feeling a little bit cheated.It's a good film on its own merits, the performances from the junior cast are outstanding, and the cinematography is up there with the best. But reading quotes like ""the ultimate feel-good movie"" don't really gel with what's presented if I'm honest.

Is it just me here, or is there a certain prejudice towards only one particular 'reality' of India, and ignorance towards other equally harsh realities, or is it because the director is a white westerner?Let me clarify here that while it may seem so, I've nothing against the film  I found it to be entertaining and quite worth a watch. Neither do I have anything against the subject or the depiction of life in Mumbai  in fact, I would have found it more memorable had it given some more screen time to the dark undercurrents of the Mumbai underbelly, which were easily the most believable and fascinating parts of the film, greatly assisted by a rousing score from A. R. Rehman. My only grouse is with the perception that the Indians have some kind of a sinister agenda to not allow this film to succeed, because we don't  as the film highlights rather well at the end of the day, it's just a way of life out here, so why the hype?After seeing Boyle's much talked-about film, it's crystal clear why this murky and squalid portrait of Mumbai has the Americans preening in delight. At one point after being thrashed mercilessly for impersonating as a guide, our hero Jamal tells a couple of American tourists, ""You wanted to see real India? Here it is"", in reply to which the American lady promptly replies, ""Now we'll show you the real America,"" and hands Jamal a $100 bill. This, without any apparent sense of irony.",Slumdog Millionaire
1102,emimaciochina,Is it worth watching?,4,22 February 2021,"Hi there! After watching this movie I am going to tell you my own opinion about it.
In 2008 appeared ,among many others, a movie directed by Danny Boyle called "" Slumdog millionaire"" telling a story about an 18-year-old boy named Jamal Malik who grew up in the Juhu Slums, Mumbai. Jamal ,played by Del Patel, is a contestant in the show ""Who wants to be a millionaire"" surprising everyone by getting every single question right. Accused of cheating he gets arrested and questioned ,therefore the reason of why he tells his story.
Is a drama/romantic movie, one of the reasons my rating is low, because its not my type of movie ,I don't really like drama,but overall it was a great movie, the actors where good and they kind of made you fell some of the feelings that the characters were feeling : the pain, sadness, anxiety , hope ,love and more. Another reason I gave the movie 4 stars is because the movie its not relatable, the only relatable thing in this movie I fell like its the forbidden love between Jamal and Latika (played by Freida Pinto).
The costumes where great, the places they filmed in where unique and one thing made me really sad are the conditions some people live in.
In the end I didn't personally like the movie, but you might enjoy it so you should watch it of you have free time and no ideas what to do.",Slumdog Millionaire
1103,street_trash_FTW,a counterfeit feel-good movie,4,25 November 2008,"This is far from a great film. Aside from being largely incoherent, it's just hard to fathom why this movie was made. It's more or less an Indian version of ""Quiz Show"" directed by an English guy. This strikes me as the kind of film that people who claim to be ""worldly"" will say is the ""BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR OMG IT'S GREAT"".I'm not against making modern fairy tales, but my major qualm with this film is setting a fairy tale against the backdrop of a capitalistic, Western game show, transplanted in India where they have their own rich culture that should be celebrated. This whole movie is centered around the idea that money is power, yet Boyle tries to disguise this with an over-the-top love story. It just reeks of bullsh*t.I'd rather watch a straight up Bollywood musical than this drivel. No thank you.",Slumdog Millionaire
1104,Robert_Sole,Lightweight and corny,3,22 January 2009,"I'm truly bewildered by the lavish praise that this movie is attracting. I just thought it corny and mildly irritating.My first problem was the half-movie/half-TV show format. A question is asked on the TV show. Cue flashback to the slums that shows how the lead character knows the answer. Each flashback involves frenetic running through narrow alleyways pursued by various evildoers. Back to the TV show. Another question followed by another flashback involving more running through the slums. By the 16,000 rupee question this was already wearing thin on me.I also didn't like the gross overuse of jerky slow motion and tilted camera angles. It just added to the repetitiveness of the question--->run through the slums---->question---- >run through the slums narrative. I'm baffled that so may critics have praised the movie because of its depiction of reality. In what universe do two brothers witness the murder of their mother at the hand of religious bigots, yet still grow up seemingly unaffected to become a couple of happy-go-lucky scamps in search of adventure? How real is the depiction of Lakita who gets sent to a brothel but the audience are assured that she was never violated and is rescued as a virgin? How many child prostitutes do you think there are in the slums of Mumbai and how many of those do you reckon are virgins? Please ponder that for a moment.This is pure Disneyfication of poverty - a world filled with mischievous and lovable little rascals who live on garbage dumps, where the baddies always get their comeuppance, where the good guys always win and where the child prostitutes are always virgins who will ultimately be whisked away by newly minted millionaires. The story is a pure fantasy, like Lady and the Tramp. A cheesy love story and a piece of cinematic bubble gum. Take it at face value and you might find the fast pace entertaining enough to pass a few hours. This is not a movie to learn about India or to gain any great insight about what life is like in the slums. It is far too lightweight for that.",Slumdog Millionaire
1105,staicuflavia,Slumdog Millionaire,8,21 May 2018,"I think this movie was a good one. It is that kind of movie which makes you realise that not everyone has a simple and beautiful life. Jamal, a little boy from Mumbay, lives a very poor and hard life. This thing is about to change when he is participating in that game show named ""Who wants to be a millionaire?"", when he wins the big prize. I apreciate that this movie is not about how much money Jamal made, is about love, dedication and loyalty. All that he does in this movie, is for the love of his life, Latika. On the other hand,I think some scenes of this movie were violent and hard to watch because they are very detailed, and the big mistake that the producers made, was that those scenes were shown at the beginning of the movie. If I was faint hearted, probably the first moment I saw those scenes, I had been turned off my laptop. I also apreciate that this was not transformed in a musical movie, like almost all indians movie are. When I hear about an indian movie, I suddenly think about people who are shaking their heads and singing indian songs. This movie, had those things, at the end.

The 8 oscars won I didn't understood, I mean there were more better movies released in that year, but you can't argue with the critics.
Secondly, the first part of the movie I found quite boring, telling the life of . The second part was actually thrilling. The main character passed his test before the big event of his life, the gameshow. He responded correctly to all of the questions and won the big prize.

With the audience of the whole nation, he is one question away from winning a thrilling 20-million rupees on India's ''Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?''. Unfortunately, when the television show breaks for the night, the police arrest him on suspicion of cheating: ''How could a homeless child know this much?!''

Malik) and Ankur Vikal (Maman) and its contrasting soundtrack ''Jai Ho'' by A.R. Rahman.
All in all, what I can say about this film is that it is especially made to open your eyes in front of the life you have to live. It represents both the good and bad parts of what a normal person can face with, so I really recommend it to those who want to be prepared for what is coming.",Slumdog Millionaire

The plot shows Jamal and his brother growing up, living some heartbreaking moments after their mother's death, up until present, when an adult version of Jamal participates in a TV show, ""How to be a millionaire"" ,so that the love of his life, Latika would see him.
As I said earlier, the acting is great, with actors like Dev Patel and Anil Kapoor. The backround track ""Jai Ho"" ties everything up in a great movie.

 He was born in this poor city and there he met his first love.This child had only his brother with him, until he betrayed him.This child became rich because he went to an intelligence show and the questions perfectly matched to his experiences from the past.
 I recognized some actors, like Dev Patel or Freida Pinto because i have seen some of their movies, like ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" or ""Chappie"".My favourite character is Jamal Malik, because he never gave up.
 In my opinion, the movie is very good because it represents the real lifestyle of a big number of humans.Also, it represents the fact that nowadays, money can buy everything, except happiness.But, i don't really think that this movie deserves 8 Oscars, i don't know exactly the reason but that's what i think.

 The story line is pretty simple, Jamal -the main character-became a contestant on India's version of ''Who want's to be a millionare'' and wins 10 million rupees. To win the money, he had to answer some questions ,the answers were good because he had the experience from the past wich helped him out.
 The film was quite good, the buget for it was 15.000.000$. The actors were amazing and well prepared but the soundtrack was horrible, a plus may be the costumes wich were realistically made.

It was directed by Danny Boyle and it starred many actors like Dev Patel, Freida Pinto and Saurabh Shukla , just to name some of them. The movie is set in Mumbai, India in the year 1992.""Slumdog Millionaire"" tells the story of 2 orphan brothers and a girl who are all very poor and live on the streets and wherever they can find shelter. As they grow up they get separated and try to find eachother with the only chance being the famous show that everyone watched "" Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"". The movie is based on a book from 2005 called ""Q & A"" wrote by Vikas Swarup. The majority of the plot revolves around the love of one of the brothers for the girl.I, myself, liked the movie but not to a certain point where to give it 8 Oscars. The movie is quite good and I especially liked how every main character evolved in their own way. The soundtrack for the movie was OK, but the actors were pretty good. This movie can really show you how the country of India is and how some parts of it look like they are from a completely different country, some parts overpopulated and poor and others extremely rich.I'd say that this is an ideal film for teenagers, the movie plot revolving around love and also having a bit of action included. This movie didn't quite hit the spot for me as I like giving movies a higher rating than others. If you like drama, romance and a bit of action this movie is for you, go give it a shot.",Slumdog Millionaire

1132,speddwayj,so bad,1,24 June 2009,"I am a 48 year old American male and I love everything from Gone With the Wind to the Terminator. I like 95% of all the westerns and about the same with documentaries and most genres, BUT SLUM DOG IS ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN , PERIOD . Everybody I watched it with said the same thing, it was junk. I have enjoyed watching paint dry better, this movie is junk. Everybody we saw it with was wondering if we even saw the right movie that won all the academy awards. This movie is not worth watching on cable if all the other channels where not available. I am just shocked to say the least. I am a 48 year old American male and I love everything from Gone With the Wind to the Terminator.

1135,fahimfaruque,Excellent Love Story Ever.................,10,15 January 2009,"This movie is very good. The child actors were awesome.When I first saw the movie, the first word came out of mouth was WOW!! In this movie JAMAL (Leading Actor) lost everything in his life, but at last he got is one and only true love. This movie is very inspiring. The movie tells you that if you are determined to do anything, there no one who can stop you. It got 4 golden globe. I think it will get academy award as well. In academy award it should get best director, best screenplay, best actor, best original score. Danny Boyel did a good job. I saw his sunshine, it was also a very good movie. This time he may get the Oscar.",Slumdog Millionaire
