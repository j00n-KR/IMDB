0,MartinHafer,Very romantic and enjoyable,8,2 August 2007,"I think I am a bit spoiled when it came to this film, as I have seen the made for TV version of this story starring Richard Chamberlain. This and Chamberlain's other Dumas tale (THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK) were made so perfectly that I can't help but immediately compare other versions to these nearly perfect films. In light of this, I am surprised that I actually liked this new version so much. While it's hard to say which film I liked better (the Chamberlain or 2002 version), it's easy to agree that they both are wonderful films. Much of the reason I liked this newer version so much is that it was a very romantic film--much more so than the other one. In addition, it was quite polished and beautiful. In fact, for once, I have nothing to really complain about, as it's a good retelling of the story.",The Count of Monte Cristo
1,Leofwine_draca,"Acceptable Hollywood swashbuckler, but hardly sparkling",5,16 May 2016,"Alexandra Dumas' classic story is given the umpteenth remake with this modern reworking, which bears the unmistakable brush of Hollywood but still manages to remain entertaining thanks to some sterling performances. The outstanding actors at work include the relatively unknown Jim Caviezel, who really shines at the put-open Edmond Dantes, and the gorgeous and talented Dagmara Dominczyk, who puts in a nicely subtle performance as his grieving wife.Guy Pearce is cast against type as the flamboyant and emotional villain of the movie, and does an excellent job with the part. Add to this some good supporting roles for the likes of Richard Harris, Luis Guzman, and James Frain, and you have what is a well-acted and thankfully mature interpretation of the storyline.On first watch of this film, you immediately notice the authentic sets and the strong cinematography which brings out the landscapes of Ireland and Malta. Amid the drama and conspiracy there are a few nice action sequences, the most notable of which is the dramatic sword-fight between Pearce and Caviezel which doesn't disappoint. Moments of humour and romance counteract with the pathos and despair and the result is a well-rounded, if not sparkling, adaptation.",The Count of Monte Cristo
2,SnoopyStyle,well made old fashion adventure with a great cast,8,12 March 2015,"It's 1815. Edmond Dantès (Jim Caviezel) tries to save his captain and seeks help on the isle of Elba. The imprisoned Napoleon Bonaparte exchanges his help with a letter secret delivery. The captain dies nevertheless. Dantès returns and gets promoted to captain. He proposes to Mercedès Iguanada (Dagmara Dominczyk). Dantès' competitive jealous best friend Fernand Mondego (Guy Pearce) gets him arrested. Chief magistrate J.F. Villefort (James Frain) covers up his father's part in Napoleon's escape plan by sending Dantès to prison. Armand Dorleac (Michael Wincott) is the sadistic warden of the island prison of Château d'If. Dantès befriends prisoner Abbé Faria (Richard Harris) who educates the illiterate Dantès. Faria was in Napoleon's army who refuses to reveal the location of Count Spada's fortune. When Napoleon escapes, Villefort schemes with Mondego to keep Dantès in prison and lie to Mercedès about his execution. Faria is killed in a cave-in. Dantès escapes. He spares Jacopo (Luis Guzmán)'s life who pledges his eternal loyalty to him. They set off to find the hidden treasure and seek revenge on all who have wronged him. He schemes to bankrupt Mondego and befriend Albert (Henry Cavill) the son of Mondego and Mercedès.It's a traditional literary adventure ripped from the golden age of Hollywood. Some may dismiss its earnest swashbuckling ways. It is melodramatic goodness. It is just so well made with a solid cast. They may not be A-list at the time but they're A-list in talent. Jim Caviezel and Guy Pearce are terrific. They have an amazing final sword fight that is both emotional and compelling. Richard Harris comes in like a call back to another era. James Frain is a great villain and it's fun to see a young Henry Cavill.",The Count of Monte Cristo
3,Hitchcoc,It Just Doesn't Hold Up to Other Versions,6,2 November 2010,"I have seen just about every version of the classic Dumas opus. This one, while it has production values, doesn't have the fine edge I've seen in others. I think it starts with Jim Caviezal. He just struck me as dull. He doesn't have the fire burning in his heart that others do. I thought Richard Chamberlain exuded hatred and inner pain. Remember, in the book his obsession with revenge really is, to some extent, his undoing. He becomes an unhappy man. The other thing that is missing here is a clear design on revenge. Each little plot works best if we have a clear understanding of the weaknesses of the conspirators and how their own greed leads to their undoing. Things just seem to happen to them. There is good swordplay here, but the Count is so dominant and so powerful, it takes most of the fun out of it. For a hero of this genre, a crisis point must be reached, a purification through suffering where we put it on the line and face the consequences. It fall flat here.",The Count of Monte Cristo
4,lee_eisenberg,"""count"" on it",7,1 September 2006,"Watching this movie version, I noticed that they changed a few things from the novel, namely the few minutes after Edmond Dantes (Jim Caviezel) gets arrested. But still, ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" manages to maintain the book's sense of adventure and everything. Caviezel makes a really cool Dantes, and it's now hard for me to imagine Guy Pearce as anything except the vile Fernand Mondego.So, this is a movie adaptation that you're sure to like. I had always liked the version starring Richard Chamberlain, but here they take everything a step further. Very enjoyable. Also starring Richard Harris, James Frain, Dagmara Dominczyk, Michael Wincott and Luis Guzman.And to think that Kevin Reynolds also directed something as stupid as ""Waterworld"".",The Count of Monte Cristo
5,ccthemovieman-1,Revenge or Justice?,9,2 March 2006,"I really didn't appreciate this film until the second viewing. Afterwards, I thought, ""Wow, that was really a satisfying, great film to watch."" Satisfying, of course, to see the typical good guy-gets-revenge tale but also a film which provided some beautiful scenery and photography all the way through: a real treat for the eyes and must-see on a widescreen DVD.I also put on the English subtitles on the second viewing in parts, which helped me understand a few things I missed on the first viewing and had made the film just a bit confusing in several parts. That was cleared up, and the rest was just enjoying the scenery and performances.Most fun to watch was Richard Harris as ""Priest,"" the longtime prisoner who tutors young Jim Caviezel, the man (Edmond Dantes) unjustly imprisoned who exacts his revenge in the last hour of the movie. Yes, Harris' teaching stretched credibility as he seems to teach his pupil about everything there is know in life! Harris, too, had some of the best lines in the movie, several very profound statements. Ironic that he would be giving Caviezel - who two years later was playing Jesus in ""The Passion Of The Christ"" - sermons about believing in God! That's Hollywood! One film you're an atheist, the next you are God.For those who might think the first 30-40 minutes of this movie are a bit slow, stay with it as the action picks up once Caviezel escapes from the prison. Shortly afterward, he is aided by the other character I found most fun to watch, played by Luis Gusman, who still sounds like he's more at home in the streets of New York but, once again, you suspend belief and just go along for the ride.Strange how our human nature makes revenge so sweet when forgiveness is the right thing to do, but Hollywood has always capitalized on this human failing, making enjoyable films like this. To be fair, it isn't just revenge, as this film points out, it's ""justice"" we all like to see. In here, the two words are interchanged, depending upon ones rationalizations.",The Count of Monte Cristo
6,rmax304823,Rousing Period Tale of Revenge.,7,28 November 2009,"James Caviezel is Edmond Dantes, an illiterate French sailor who is framed on a charge of treason by his friend Guy Pearce, the first mate on Dantes' ship Albie Woodington, and the magistrate James Frain. Pearce wants (and gets) Dantes beloved, Dagmara Dominczyk. Woodington wants Dantes' promotion to captain. The magistrate is protecting his family, who are Napoleanistas.Caviezel is convicted without trial and sent to the Château D'Ifre, which in fact is still there and can be visited by tourists. (It's the place where Fernando Rey meets the TV personality in ""The French Connection."") The dungeon is a pretty crummy place. Most dungeons, in my experience, are. But Caviezel has the good fortune to meet a fellow prisoner, Richard Harris, who is a learned priest and teaches him everything from fencing through the ABCs to, significantly, Machiavelli. Caviezel escapes from the prison eleven years later, not only educated but knowing the location of a vast treasure on the island of Monte Cristo, which he retrieves with the help of a deeply indebted pirate.I mean it, this guy has money coming out the wazoo. He buys what looks like the Palace of Versailles and pays for it in negligible cash. He wears clothes from Armani and Rolex watches and Gucci Pucci loafers. Well, not really, but he's rich as Croesus.Older and longer-haired, he sets out to take revenge on his three enemies -- four, if you count his one-time love, Dominczyk, who seems to have betrayed him by marrying Pearce a month after being told of Caviezel's ""death"".In this he's assisted by his devoted ex-pirate Sancho Panza or whatever he's called. He's played by Luis Guzman, who looks the part but seems uncomfortable with lines like, ""I shall always protect you, even from yourself."" In fact, the script itself sometimes sounds hyperelegant, as if the writers had tried too hard to lend it classical resonance. ""Will you excuse he and I for a moment?"" And what production values! A thousand extras in opulent period wardrobe await Caviezel's entrance in the palace gardens when he gives his first party. He makes a Liberace-like descent from a hot air balloon and announces himself, ""Greetings. I am the Count of Monte Cristo."" The ruination of his enemies proceeds apace, but the truth is that it's a little confusing at times. The magistrate is tricked into confessing to murder and is sent off to meet his fate. The envious first mate is trapped while skimming off the top and barely escapes hanging. Pearce, the enemy-in-chief, is subject to financial ruin and, because despite all his villainy he is a man of honor, finally to being run through with Caviezel's sword in a fair duel. But his lost love recognizes Caviezel and her apparent betrayal is explained satisfactorily.Well, it's an alien setting and the story is a little complicated, harder to follow here than in the 1935 Robert Donat version. I expected to be numbed by the whole affair, the way I sometimes am with adaptations of Dickens, but this version picks up pace as it moves along and there are occasional scraps of action that wake you up.Not a bad job.",The Count of Monte Cristo
7,ma-cortes,Good and colorful adaptation based on the classical story from Alexandre Dumas novel,7,2 August 2004,"This faithful filmization concerns the notorious starring named Edmond Dantes (well featured by James Cazievel) who's betrayed by his friends , the count Montego (Guy Pearce who was originally offered the lead role of Edmond) and others , as the astute chief magistrate (James Frain). He's framed as sender of Napoleon's letters who's jailed in island of Elba . Then , he's punished to life imprison in island of If where he finds a lot of suffering . Dantes is imprisoned on the island prison of Château d'If for 18 years, where he plots revenge against those who betrayed him . While imprisoned, he meets the Abbe Faria (Richard Harris), a fellow prisoner whom everyone believes to be mad. The Abbe tells Edmond of a fantastic treasure hidden away on a tiny island, that only he knows the location of. Edmond spends years unjustly at the Château-prison but he escapes and gets the treasure of Montecristo .He proceeds to transform himself into the wealthy Count of Monte Cristo as part of his plan to carry out a relentless vendetta against his enemies . The revenge is ready against the nasty traitors who accused him.This is a fine and enjoyable but overlong remake of the Alexander Dumas tale by the same name . In the film there are adventures , action , a love story , derring-do and results to be pretty amusing . Agreeable and attractive rendition based on the famous novel with emotional highs and lows , in which Edmond Dantes is unjustly sent to prison for several years , and with the help another prisoner he escapes to reclaim his fiancée Mercedes and to exact his merciless revenge . Although movie runtime is two hours and some and is neither tiring , nor boring but entertaining . James Cazievel's interpretation is first-rate as his subsequent acting in ¨The Passion of the Christ¨by Mel Gibson . He leads a magnificent cast in this rousing classic . Guy Pearce plays correctly the evil villain Montego and Dagmara Domincyk is wonderful as the fiancée , though she is only seven years older than Henry Cavill who plays her son. Riveting Richard Harris in a brief appearance , he gives a phenomenal acting in his last film as an old inmate in the terrible island of If . It packs a brilliant and glimmering cinematography by cameraman Andrew Dunn . As well as emotive and evocative musical score by Ed Shearmur . This superb motion picture was well directed by Kevin Reynolds (Fandango , Waterworld , Robin Hood ). The flick will appeal to adventure buffs and emotion lovers . Rating : 7/10 . Good , better than average . Well worth watching .Other adaptations about this known novel are the following ones : ¨Count of Montecristo¨ by Rowland V. Lee with Robert Donat , Louisa Landi , Louis Calhern ; ¨El conde de Montecristo"" (1953) by Leon Klimomovsky with Jorge Mistral ; ¨Le Comte De Monte Cristo ¨(1961) by Claude Aunt Lara with Louis Jourdan ; TV retelling ¨Count of Montecristo¨by David Greene with Richard Chamberlain , Donald Pleasence , Tony Curtis ; ¨Le Comte De Monte-Cristo"" series (1979) with Jacques Wever , ¨The Count of Monte Cristo¨ (1992) and the best TV mini-series ¨The count of Montecristo¨(1998) by Josee Dayan with Gerard Depardieau , Jean Rochefort , Pierre Arditi , Ornella Muti and Michael Aumont .",The Count of Monte Cristo
8,blanche-2,Different from the book but vastly entertaining,8,5 September 2007,"James Caviezel is ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" in this stunning 2002 film also starring Guy Pearce, Richard Harris and Dagmara Dominczyk. It's a familiar enough story with some major changes from the book; nevertheless, this is a spirited, splendid production that holds one's interest from beginning to end. The story takes place in France where Edmond Dantes (Caviezel) is set up by his best friend Fernan (Pearce) to appear as a conspirator who joins in a plot to help Napoleon escape from Elba. Dantes is arrested and sent to a horrible island prison. The reason? Fernan wants Dantes' beautiful fiancé, Mercedes. While in prison, he meets an elderly man, Abbe Faria (Harris) who is burrowing an escape tunnel. With a way to sneak into each other's cell, he gives Dantes the education he never had, and also gives him a map to a treasure. Dantes escapes and vows to extract his revenge and all who tried to destroy him. He finds the treasure and becomes ""The Count of Monte Cristo."" Visually stunning, this version of the story has marvelous performances by the very handsome Caviezel, who makes a compelling Dantes, and Guy Pearce, excellent as the evil Fernan. The standout role, of course, is that of Abbe Faria, brilliantly portrayed by Richard Harris.Highly recommended - more expensive looking than ""Son of Fury,"" perhaps, but an old-fashioned adventure film for sure.",The Count of Monte Cristo
9,Quinoa1984,"Ah, bittersweet revenge",7,27 January 2002,"(Possible spoilers ahead)Alexandre Dumas' The Count of Monte Cristo is a sweeping, often kinetic and well acted tale that takes place in good old (or bad old) France in the early 19th century.  Caviezel is a son of a clerk Edmund Dantes, Pearce a nobel son Fernand Mondego, who are friends at the start of the film just returning from Napoleon Bonaparte (or one of them returning from seeing him) in exile.  But soon, Mondego sees that Dantes has what he can't have- a love, a Captainship, et all.  This causes the classic betrayal effect with Dantes being sent to a far away prison.  It looks like doom for him, until a veteran in the prison (Richard Harris whose scenes steal that part of the show) partners with him to dig out and to teach him a thing here and there including swordsmanship.  When he digs out, the revenge kicks in in a startling and cool way.Read the book or not, Count of Monte Cristo entertains to it's greatest extent with some fine performances turned in by Harris, Caviezel, Pearce and even Guzman in a small role, and some excellent locations.  Worth the admission even if it ends a bit too predictable.  A-",The Count of Monte Cristo
10,edwagreen,This Count Delivers As Original Did-Count of Monte Cristo ****,9,27 April 2010,"Believe it or not, I will state that this version was better than the one with the late great Robert Donat in the title role.Naturally, it's a story dealing with revenge and ultimate redemption. The leads here are excellent as we learn a lesson about money not only being the root of all evil, but how it can be used to extract revenge before being used to do good things with.Jim Caviezel is outstanding in the title role and he receives terrific supporting performances as well.The movie chronicles his betrayal by his best friend as well as the local magistrate and how he suffers in a Devil's Island like situation only to escape and become an exceedingly wealthy man.The set decorations are absolutely opulent and we get a chill by the prison like atmosphere that Dantes had to endure. By the way, in this version, his last name is pronounced as if it were an American name. In the original with Donat, the name was given a French flare, but after all, author Alexander Dumas was exactly that.",The Count of Monte Cristo
11,hitchcockthelegend,Fantastic story given a quite smashing adaptation.,8,6 February 2010,"Every once in a while, when Hollywood is stuck for new swashbuckling ideas, they turn to the writer of ""The Three Musketeers"", ""The Man In The Iron Mask"" and ""The Count Of Monte Cristo"", one Alexandre Dumas père. Which of course is no bad thing as long as the adaptation is given care and consideration - which hasn't always been the case. So when it was announced that the director of Waterworld, Kevin Reynolds, was to direct the latest version of ""The Count Of Monte Cristo"", many feared the worst. Made for around $35 million, Reynolds' film fared OK at the Worldwide box office, taking in around $76 million. Yet although far from being a flop, it upped and vanished rather quickly and was barely given a mention come the arrival of 2003. Thankfully the film gathered momentum with the rental releases and is now firmly established as a much loved genre piece.On the two big hitting movie internet sites, Rotten Tomatoes & IMDb, the film scores 75% and 7.5 respectively, that's about right I would say. Reynolds' film doesn't bring anything new to the table as regards the story, but if it isn't broke then why fix it? Staying safe and true to the spirit of the source, Reynolds has simply crafted a rip roaring movie about betrayal, torture, faith, revenge and love. The makers have costumed it up and added the necessary sword play ingredient. All that was needed was for his cast to deliver performances worthy of such period shenanigans. And he got them.James Caviezel plays Edmond Dantes. Two years away from playing Jesus Christ, the role that would make his name known, Caviezel had prior to Cristo looked anything but a leading man. But here he finds a role to get his teeth into and it's a comfortable fit, and crucially he seems to be having a good time with it. No such point to prove for Guy Pearce (Fernand Mondego) though, for he already had ""L.A. Confidential"" & ""Memento"" under his belt. Here he gives it the full pompous villain act and struts around like some dandy spoiled brat. It's a film stealing performance that shows that the guy who played Mike Young in Aussie soaper Neighbours, has indeed come a long way. Richard Harris adds a touch of class as Abbé Faria, gravel voiced Michael Wincott does a nice line in sadistic bastard as the Château D'If governor, Armand Dorleac. While Luis Guzmán as Jacopo is fun comic relief and Dagmara Dominczyk as Mercedès Iguanada is both sensual and heartfelt.Never over camping the movie, Reynolds keeps it pacey and dots it with smart set pieces and memorable scenes. Backed up by an on form cast and a sure fire source story to work from, ""The Count Of Monte Cristo"" turns out to be period winner. So see it if you haven't done so already. 8/10",The Count of Monte Cristo
12,Theo Robertson,Sprawling Epic . Perhaps Too Sprawling,6,21 August 2005,"I've never read Alexander Dumas original novel of THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO but it comes across as a sprawling epic if this adaptation is anything to go by . Two young men Edmond Dantes a commoner and the nobleman Fernand Mondego land on St Elbe to seek help for their sick captain . They meet Napoleon who asks Edmond to take a letter to an old army friend which sets up the plot that involves betrayal , torture , imprisonment and revenge It's a good enough story but one I thought where its epic scope spoils the narrative somewhat . The story becomes episodic instead of tightly plotted and I know the story takes place over many years but even so I found myself rather bored in places during the second half of the movie as the story builds up to the hero getting his revenge To be fair Kevin Reynolds has made a film that - While not reaching its full potential - remains watchable and much this is down to the cast . Jim Caviezel is possibly hampered by the script but as a sympathetic hero he does what he's required while Guy Pearce as scheming back stabber Fernand Mondego is memorable but not as memorable as Edmond's cellmate who is played by Richard Harris , but not even Richard Harris gives the most memorable role in the movie because that accolade goes to Michael Wincott as the prison governor . Maybe that's why I eventually got bored halfway through - Mondego only appears intermittently in the second half while the two prison characters quickly disappear from the plot",The Count of Monte Cristo
13,dbborroughs,An Unexpected Classic,9,28 February 2004,"Before this film had come out I had little hope that it would be anything special. Recent Hollywood remakes of classic Dumas tales such as The Three Musketeers and Man in the Iron Mask were interesting failures, they seemed not to have a reason to exist.Then out of nowhere came this new version of the Count. Perfectly made at every level this version of the story seems to just want to tell you the story of a wronged man who moves to get revenge simply because it can do so with a sense of fun Hollywood hasn't had since the 1930's.Filming in real locations instead of the studio back lot this version opens up the story in ways that give one a wonderful sense of place. The action is sparse but when it comes it sucks you in.Best of all is the cast which has good guys who a truly good, bad guys who are truly bad and rogues who are just a hell of a lot of fun. I've watched this film probably twenty times, the result of stopping every time I see it on cable. I have enjoyed it equally as much each and every time.(my sole quibble is its a tad slow until Edmond is thrown in jail)This is one of the greats of modern cinema.",The Count of Monte Cristo
14,anaconda-40658,Jim Caviezel of Monte Cristo!,8,1 May 2015,"The Count of Monte Cristo (2002): Dir: Kevin Reynolds / Cast: Jim Caviezel, Guy Pearce, Richard Harris, Michael Wincott, Luis Guzman: Entertaining adventure despite being a duplicate of The Mask of Zorro and The Man in the Iron Mask. It stars Jim Caviezel and Guy Pearce as sailors and best friends until Pearce is overcome with jealousy. Caviezel is framed for murder and serves a savage prison sentence while Pearce marries his fiancée and has a son. He encounters Richard Harris in prison who tells him of a treasure before he dies. He manages a clever escape and is soon the Count of Monte Cristo. Predictable yet detailed plotting with spectacular production values. An improvement for director Kevin Reynolds after being responsible for the embarrassing over priced Waterworld as well as the over done Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, which proves that big budgets do not necessarily improve classic stories. Caviezel displays range as the Count who seeks revenge, but Pearce is subdued in a flat straight forward role. Harris is interesting in a key role. Michael Wincott plays a brutal prison guard whose methods will eventually backfire. Despite familiar material the film is eye candy in terms of art direction and its presentation time frame. Theme regards revenge in that God will bring justice. What is most interesting is how the Count makes his enemies convict themselves. Score: 8 ½ / 10",The Count of Monte Cristo
15,Wuchakk,Quality historical fiction inspired by the book,7,4 October 2015,"Released in 2002, ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" chronicles Edmond Dantes (Jim Caviezel) betrayal by his best friend (Guy Pearce) and a magistrate (James Frain) in 1815 and his ignominious exile to a prison isle for the next 13 years where he discovers a mentor (Richard Harris). His misfortune causes him to forsake God and fuels his thirst for vengeance. Will he get it? Will he reunite with his beloved (Dagmara Dominczyk)? Alex Norton has a small role as Napoleon Bonaparte.While the first half follows Dumas' long 1844 novel, the second half deviates. The screenwriter said he purposely wasn't making it like the book because he wasn't trying to recreate it. He wanted to do his own thing and there's nothing wrong with this, particularly since it'd take a miniseries to do justice to the novel.The movie is entertaining because it throws in everything but the kitchen sink – pirates, Napoleon, secret messages, romance, friendship, envy, betrayal, dungeons, escape plots, swashbuckling, comedic elements, a treasure map, French high society, revenge, redemption and family; and does this in just over two hours. I'd give it a higher grade, but the story is sometimes unrealistic in a melodramatic way, sorta like the miniseries North and South if it were put on the big screen.The film runs 131 minutes and was shot in Hollywood/Burbank/Los Angeles.GRADE: B+",The Count of Monte Cristo

It was done accurately, unlike the Titanic for its time frame.(No one sounded like a surfer)  The story of revenge is sweet, where one satisfies their hatred of past wrongs.  The story twists, and bends perfectly, like the films of the 70's which covered this area. The lead actor played his role perfectly, and Guy Pearce is a good villain. This film is a must see and do not wait for video.",The Count of Monte Cristo
17,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: The Count of Monte Cristo,9,23 October 2005,"Alexandre Dumas is probably more famous for his The Three Muskateers, and in the last decade, that movie has been remade in its latest incantation starring Charlie Sheen, Oliver Platt and Kiefer Sutherland in the title roles, with Chris O'Donnell as D'artagnan. Hollywood followed that up with The Man in the Iron Mask, with strong character actors like Jeremy Irons, Gabriel Byrne, John Malkovich, Gerard Depardieu flanking Leonardo DiCaprio as King Louis XIV/Philippe.Adapting from yet another Dumas story, The Count of Monte Cristo continues the tradition of a strong cast in the likes of Jim Caviezel and Guy Pearce in lead roles, with Michael Wincott and Richard Harris in bit roles.Set in the era of Napoleon's exile from France, this movie tells the story of good friends Edmond Dantes (Caviezel) and Fernand Mondego (Pearce). The former is an ordinary lad with no status and of simple mind, but has incredible luck shining upon him, while the latter is the son of a Count, and harbours a great envy for his friend.And the worst enemy would always be your best friend, so the saying goes, as Mondego plots with fellow collaborators and frames Dantes for treason, and gets him imprisoned on an island, and makes Dantes' fiancé his wife.For 13 years, Dantes becomes disillusion while whipped on the anniversary of his imprisonment (yes, even before his Passion of the Christ role), but chance would have that he befriends a fellow prisoner, a priest who teaches him how to read, write, fight, fence, and various subjects of the world, for the return favour of helping him dig a tunnel to escape. A miraculous escape opportunity presented itself, and the priest reveals to Dante the map of secret treasure on the island of Monte Cristo.Naturally, everything has changed since the last he stepped foot on Marseille, and Dantes plots revenge, to take away everything from his enemies, like what they did to him. Hence, the Count of Monte Cristo is born, and so begins the meticulous execution of his plan. Weaved into the plot is the love story between Dantes and Mercedes (Dagmara Dominczyk), with a now familiar revelation that countless other movies and books have adapted from.If you've read Dumas' classic, you would already know the details of the plot. But what delivers here is the excellent acting, and beautiful sets. Definitely a must watch. My only regret was not being able to watch it in the local theatres when it was released, because of its short run. A real pity.Code 1 DVD Extras: Audio commentary by the director, 4 deleted scenes, and plenty of making-of featurettes.",The Count of Monte Cristo
18,Mr-Fusion,An essential story,7,30 September 2014,"Just to make sure there's no air of pretense, let me say I've never read THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO . . . but the movie version is pretty flippin' cool. This is probably the purest revenge story there is. Not necessarily the most entertaining (though it's got plenty that satisfies), but one that straightforwardly examines how the thirst for vengeance can both drive and cancerously consume. In that respect, this is powerful stuff, and often injected with a spirit of adventure. And as much as I'm a Guy Pearce fan, it's Ed Harris who handily steals the movie. 7/10",The Count of Monte Cristo
19,JamesHitchcock,"Now I can even forgive Kevin Reynolds for ""Waterworld""",8,16 March 2012,"""The Count of Monte Cristo"" is set in the France of the 1810s, 1820s and 1830s, the years during which the French monarchy was re-established following the fall of Napoleon. Edmond Dantès, a young sailor, is arrested and charged with treason against the restored monarch Louis XVIII. Although he is innocent, he is imprisoned in the Château d'If, a notorious prison on an island in Marseilles harbour. After fifteen years he manages to escape and subsequently becomes immensely wealthy. (As with all good adventure story heroes, the source of his wealth is a long-lost buried treasure). Calling himself ""The Count of Monte Cristo"", after the Italian island on which the treasure was found, he returns to France swearing revenge on the three men who conspired to have him imprisoned. They are Danglars, a jealous former shipmate who coveted a promotion which went to Dantès, Villefort, a corrupt magistrate anxious to cover up some murky secrets in his own past, and Dantès' aristocratic one-time friend Fernand Mondego, who betrayed him because of his lust for Dantès' beautiful fiancée Mercédès.I won't set out the plot in any more detail, as it gets quite complex, although not quite as complicated as Alexandre Dumas' original novel. Suffice it to say that it is a swashbuckling adventure in the best traditional manner, reminiscent of the sort of movies that Errol Flynn, Stewart Granger and a young Burt Lancaster were making in the 1940s and 1950s. (There is a superb duel between Dantès and Mondego).I understand that there have been numerous earlier cinema adaptations of the novel, although I have not seen any of them. This version, however, is a splendid one, one of the best adventure films of the 2000s. James Caviezel seemed to be one of the rising stars of the early twenty-first century, and although I have not heard much of him since he played Jesus in Mel Gibson's controversial ""The Passion of the Christ"", he makes an excellent swashbuckling hero. There are also good contributions from Guy Pearce as the false and treacherous Mondego, Richard Harris in one of his penultimate feature film (his last was to be ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"") as the Abbé Faria, another prisoner who befriends Dantès in the Château d'If, and the lovely Dagmara Dominczyk as Mercédès. Dagmara is another actor of whom not much has been heard since she did this film; perhaps she might have had more luck with a more Anglo-Saxon name.The film was directed by Kevin Reynolds who clearly has a talent for adventure films of this type, as he also made a very decent version of the Robin Hood legend, ""Robin Hood- Prince of Thieves"".

The Count of Monte Cristo, one the best books of all time. I read the book back in high school and it was the first book I had finished way before the assignments were supposed to be done. The whole idea of this story was just so exciting to me and I imagined what the characters looked like, what the places looked like and how the fights were styled. I was so enchanted by this book, but oddly enough I never saw the movie and I don't know why. But I found a local Blockbuster that was closing and saw a brand new copy of The Count of Monte Cristo on sale, I grabbed it immediately and watched it this weekend. I really liked this movie, I think it did the book justice. It was so exciting to see all these wonderful characters come to life as we see The Count of Monte Cristo prove that good can triumph and karma does exist.Edmond Dantès and his friend, Fernand Mondego, officers of a French trading ship, head to Elba seeking medical attention for their captain. Dantès and Mondego are chased by English Dragoons who believe they are spies for the exiled Napoleon Bonaparte. The Emperor arrives and declares they are not his agents, and asks Dantès to give a letter to a friend in France. At Marseilles, Dantès is reprimanded by the ship's first mate, Danglars for disobeying orders. However, the shipping company's boss, Morrell, commends Dantès' bravery, promoting him over Danglars. Mondego intercepts Dantès' fiancée Mercédès and unsuccessfully tries to seduce her. When he hears of Dantès' promotion, Mondego realizes that Dantès will be able to marry Mercédès sooner than expected. Mondego gets drunk and tells Danglars about the letter Napoleon gave Dantès. Danglars has Dantès charged with treason and sent to magistrate J.F. Villefort. Sent to prison for 13 years, he escapes with the help of a fellow inmate. Now thirsty for revenge, Edmond takes on a different identity of The Count of Monte Cristo and wants to pay Mondego back for taking his life away for so long.Both Jim Caviezel and Guy Pearce had great chemistry. Guy had this look and arrogance about him that looked perfect for Mondego. He didn't make Mondego into a typical bad guy because you could understand why he was so upset with his life. He was evil to do that to his friend, but he had motive and wasn't a stereotypical villain. Jim did a wonderful job as Edmond, played to a note on what Edmond is: charming, dashing, smart, kind and strong. You feel such sympathy for this man who just wanted to live a normal life with his lovely fiancé and to have a family. It's so quickly taken away from him and it's just tragic what he has to go through. The people he lost, the life he had, to be in solitary confinement, you could only imagine how horrific it must have been for him. The sets in the movie are astonishing. I can't describe the excitement I felt when you see Edmond come into his party from an air balloon and in slow motion as he walks down the steps with his coat blowing in the wind, I want to enter a party like that! Moving on, the film really is wonderful, at times very predictable excusing if you've already read the book. The only actor I complain about is Luis Guzmán who came off more creepy than loyal at times. But a timeless story of revenge and rising above it all, I'm sure that you'll find The Count of Monte Cristo a treat not to be missed.8/10",The Count of Monte Cristo

22,KineticSeoul,Vengeance movie well worth seeing,8,10 August 2012,"Now this is a awesome revenge with just about every element put together in a coherent manner. It has a great plot and emotion going for it. And even has two good actors that fit their roles perfectly. The only other person that might have pulled off the role of Edmond Dantès is Christian Bale. But James Caviezel is better for this role. This Alexandre Dumas story has inspired other movies and shows, but this is the original. Just about everything about this movie is executed very well. But if your a hardcore fan of the book that wants to see how it goes down exactly like the book might be slightly disappointed. But it does focus on the core of the story. I always imagined the ending happening the way it's portrayed in the movie and found it satisfying although the novels ending is more meaningful. I saw a segment of this story on a TV show called ""Wishbone"" which showed a ending closer to the novel and wasn't satisfied with it when I was a kid. Guy Pearce also put on a good performance as Fernand Mondego, especially with the mannerism and the way he talks. His portrayal of greed and jealousy is very believable. The pacing of this movie is very well done and the gradual change of Dantès from the beginning to how he is at the end is balanced out. Overall this a most definitely a vengeance movie worth seeing.8.3/10",The Count of Monte Cristo
23,Lejink,High count,8,29 November 2015,"I consider Alexandre Dumas' original novel to be probably the best adventure story I've ever read and would recommend everyone to immerse themselves in it as I did. However it was some years ago that I did so and as it recedes from my memory, I can't recall in detail the incidents from the book as they correlate to this film dramatisation by Kevin Reynolds, late of Kevin Costner's career-torpedoing ""Waterworld"", so that I can't take the point of view of some of the reviewers here about disparities with the source.For me then it was just a case of just sitting back, identifying enough with the main characters and following again the twists and turns of the story but not slavishly carping with any major deviations from Dumas' written word. It would be impossible anyway to condense such a massive tome into a two hour movie (watch the worthy French language six-part version starring Gerard Depardieu for that), so I just let myself be royally entertained with this sumptuously filmed, sharply written and well acted tale of jealousy, comradeship, enduring love but most of all, of course, revenge.The costumes and sets are a sight for sore eyes as are the well-chosen actual locations, particularly for the climactic scene at the ruined cloisters plus I liked the way film flagged its plotting intentions in planting in advance the little motifs by which Dantes will ensnare all his future prey, carefully dotting the i's and crossing the t's as he lures them to their deserved fates. All the leads perform well, Jim Caviezel mysterious but twisted as the too-trusting innocent taken in by best-friend Colin Farrell's covetous, asinine Mendango, Dagmara Dominczyk exotic but vulnerable as the woman they both love but who ultimately never wavers in her true devotion and Richard Harris in an effective cameo as the old priest who initially supplies the means by which Dantes can embark on his grand plan of payback but who also plants the seed for his moral redemption by the film's close.I almost couldn't believe that this was the same director who helmed Costner's expensive folly. Here Reynolds' direction flows excellently, always at the service of the story, nicely mixing up the action and suspense and while detractors might demur at the liberties taken with the text, I think the film still managed to purvey the underlying themes of the book and most importantly, entertained and thrilled this viewer at the same time.",The Count of Monte Cristo
24,paul2001sw-1,"Less swash, more buckle",4,7 October 2006,"One doesn't expect immense subtlety from an unashamed swashbuckler of a movie live this, and indeed the story is pretty one sided, a brilliant, good and immensely rich man seeks revenge on those who have wronged him. But one does expect a little bit more swashbuckling, for this is an anaemic film, which inspires almost no level of emotional involvement: the decks are stacked just too far to make the story interesting, and the action scenes fall flat because the whole configuration of the story so plainly predicts their outcome. The film is also marred by a curious collection of contemporary accents. Perhaps a little more of the evidently lavish budget should have been spent on securing a screenplay written by someone with some idea of how to construct a narrative that makes the viewer care.",The Count of Monte Cristo
25,Cineanalyst,The Count of Action Heroes,6,19 September 2021,"As I write this, I've heard there are plans for another modern adaptation, but, as of yet, this ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" remains the most recent popular theatrically-released screen version of the novel by Alexandre Dumas. I've been seeking out a bunch of variations on this much-adapted book since reading it. Perhaps, it's my fault for viewing this one after the prior depiction I saw being a masterpiece of the late silent era, the 1929 ""Monte Cristo,"" but this 21st-century counterpart is underwhelming. The best part here was the addition of more action scenes, of which there is actually very little of on the swashbuckling page. Thus, Edmond Dantès gets into a shootout with Redcoats on the island of Elba, temporarily escapes arrest to get into his first sword fight, has a training montage involving such combat with the Abbé Faria while imprisoned, fights the prison warden, fights with pirates a couple times, and, of course, gets into an extended climactic duel--none of which is from the original prose. Faithfulness to a source matters very little to me, so I appreciate the alterations that make for a better visual and stylistically updated cinematic transmutation, although the score is a bit much sometimes, and they over do it on swords being knocked out of characters' hands during the duels. Otherwise, too, this is relatively poorly constructed compared to other versions, let alone the almost-absurdly intricate novel.Listening to the screenwriter Jay Wolpert in the DVD extras, it's apparent his appreciation of the novel and how to adapt it cinematically is shallow at best. Even the appreciated addition of the Count's appearance amid fireworks in a balloon seemed to have credit taken for it by the director. Regardless, a lot of Dumas's long-winded text, of course, needed excising for a movie of barely more than two hours length. Many little changes are made to accommodate that, as well as the spectacle-based additions. Much of it hardly matters: Danglers, for instance, remains in this shipping business instead of becoming a banker. As the 1929 film evidenced, there's no need for the character at all. This one, meanwhile, drops more interesting characters. The Count's servants and slaves from the book are mostly reduced to one helper. Other little things, such as the business with the hair twirling and the chess piece help simplify the following of and revealing of character identities. The first half of the film is quite well done, overall, even though it drops the wedding celebration where Edmond was originally arrested and which prior movie versions tend to film quite well--even if they don't realize the duality of Edmond and Villefort both celebrating engagements. It also seems that they forgot that they made Edmond initially illiterate since they have him writing a complete sentence on his prison wall even before the filmmakers appreciably take plenty of time with the scenes between him and the Abbé Faria and the education that the older prisoner imparts on the younger.The second half feels rushed--undermining the revenge plot. Villefort is promised an extended punishment by the Count, for instance, but we never see it. Instead, every important character left after that shows up, one by one, for seemingly several scenes to be played out at once for, despite all the action going on, an abrupt finale. Moreover, although Wolpert appears to try to take credit for focusing on the romance between Edmond and Mercédès, along with the supposed surprise twist involving her son, all of that is plagiarized from many other, prior adaptations. The earliest ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" movie I've seen, from 1913, included it. Having the Count doubt his belief in God may be new, as is Fernand's newfound classism, but all of that is slight. Taking a page from ""Strangers on a Train"" (1951) to get rid of two periphery characters and fathers is a less sensible departure, though. If one isn't familiar with the novel or other movie versions, or if they overlook some of the poor construction, whether that related to adaptation or not, it's a decent, action-packed swashbuckler.",The Count of Monte Cristo
26,Thanos_Alfie,Nice movie...,7,5 December 2018,"""The Count of Monte Cristo"" is an Action - Adventure movie which is based on the book of Alexandre Dumas and we watch a young man falsely imprisoned due to some reasons he cannot understand. During the time that he is in the prison, he meets an old man who informs him for a treasure. After a period of time, he escapes from that prison, he tries to find the treasure the old man told him about and he seeks revenge.I liked this movie because it was a bit different from the book but the presentation of it was very good. I liked the plot of it and I believe that the direction which was made by Kevin Reynolds was equally good with many interesting scenes not only with action but also with romance and drama. I also liked the interpretation of Jim Caviezel who played as Edmond Dantes and he was simply amazing. Other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Richard Harris who played as Abbé Faria, Guy Pearce's who played as Fernand Mondego and Luis Guzmán's who played as Jacopo.Finally, I have to say that ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" is a very interesting movie with a great plot and some equally good plot twists.

27,filipemanuelneto,"A pretty good movie, but not surprising.",5,9 September 2016,"Based on the novel by Alexandre Dumas, this is the story of revenge Edmond Dantes, a man betrayed by his friends and imprisoned for a crime he did not commit. Directed by Kevin Reynolds, has a screenplay adapted by Jay Wolpert and has Jim Caviezel in the title role.This story is well known and is very good in film. Its an appealing story, with romance, good arguments for action and all that general public tends to like. Nevertheless, its not an action film, but a drama, focused on the destroyed life of a man and his thirst for revenge. The script is not brilliant, nor can we be tempted to compare it with the original book. But it does a competent job and transpose to the screen most of the major aspects of the novel, while adapting some points and bringing some new features that don't appear in the book, for dramatic purposes. In my opinion, the greatest sin of this script is the too much focus on Mondego, so that the revenge Dantés exerts on other three conspirators is hardly explained (one of Them ends up not even appear in the film).The main actors are Jim Caviezel and Guy Pearce, respectively in the role of protagonist and the main villain. Both are good investments: Pearce can be annoying with his arrogant attitude and Caviezel gives his character a certain hardness, without losing kindness and sense of justice. But this is not one of the best films of the two actors. It was shot at very attractive locations, from a visual point of view, and has good visual effects and costumes.In short: it's a good movie, which easily appeals to everyone and fulfills its role to entertain and tell a story. However, is not brilliant or particularly remarkable.",The Count of Monte Cristo

He is to be the new ship's Captain, marry his betrothed Mercedes (Dagmara Dominczyk) and live a good and long life. However greedy, envious and jealous men Lt.

The kindly old man educates Edmond in return for companionship. Upon the old man's death, Edmond is bequeathed a fabulous treasure map. With his good friend Jacopo (played adroitly by Luis Guzmán) he prepares to return from the grave and exact revenge.

29,generationofswine,An Honest Review,1,24 December 2019,"Well, it's not one quality... but I like to do a thumbs up or thumbs down approach. If the movie entertains a thumbs up, if it doesn't a thumbs down. Seems simpler than debating on a 4, a 5, a 6, whatever.This is also kind of why I want to be able to review individual actors, just so I can write a memo to Guy Peirce and tell him that he needs to stop doing period literary pieces and go back to making films that don't require ascots and puffs.And this brings me to the point in the review where I question why I know what the difference between an ascot and a puff are.Anyway, self-reflection aside, the problem is that it doesn't know if it wants to be a thrilling adventure novel that is best epitomized by the writings of Dumas in all his pulp adventure glory... or if the story lasted in popularity for a century or so too long and now has to be regarded as a drama and treated with all the seriousness of a mature literary classic.It teases with both and never settles on either. It kind of comes across that Wolpert, the writer, understood that Dumas was a pulp adventure writer but Reynolds, the director, thought Dumas was as serious as Dante.It makes you feel like you are sitting in two different worlds. It kind of feels like you are watching a movie that wants to be a fun adventure yarn about revenge and prison breaks but every time that beast tries to escaped, it's forced back into it's cage by directorial gods of pretentious pompery.This is the type of movie that you'd get if the director of ""Taming of the Shrew"" thought everything Shakespeare wrote was ""Richard III""... it's unsettling how deadly serious it takes itself.",The Count of Monte Cristo
30,CubsandCulture,So old fashioned as to be nearly revolutionary.,10,2 May 2021,"Back in 2002 when I watched this in the theater I thought it was a perfect Saturday matinee film. It plays like one of the classic swashbucklers staring Flynn. It has everything that makes Hollywood cinema larger than life-bold themes, big twists, exotic locales and a wide selection of scenes, i.e. Swordfights and high society. The film is endlessly entertaining because of this grand quality. I just re-watched it for the first in years and I was struck by just how decidedly classic the film is in its aims, text and performances.The script never gets bogged down in excessive details or convoluted mythology. For as wide as a story the film tells the plot is blunt in how it is told. The actors all turn in broad engaging performances-Guy Pearce seems to simply love playing the heavy and Jim Caviezel nails all the aspect of his character. The director is impersonal and polished in the way that gets everything he can from the script. There is no shaky cam or experiment. Just straight forward classical visual construction.Most action and adventure films of the 2000's and the 2010's-influenced by LOTR, the MCU, Matrix Series, etc.-lack the simplicity and theatricality that this film has. Instead they are all have convoluted mythology that unnecessarily ""explains"" every detail. Worst they all have a self-serious tone and atmosphere where even the comic relief is not allowed to have fun. This film is such a throwback to the 30's and 40's-it is decidedly earnest in its themes while being theatrical in its plot and characters-that it stands apart from much of American tentpole cinema of the last 20 years. It is sad that this didn't do well at the box office but it is precisely the qualities that make it such a refreshing film that a lot of people apparently find off-putting.",The Count of Monte Cristo

Several years later, he uses hidden treasure and a sense of cunning in order to get his revenge against those that wronged him in the past...Although it's perhaps a little slow going in terms of setting up its narrative, The Count of Monte Cristo still more-or-less delivered on what I hoped it would do; the story is engaging and interesting and is anchored by an excellent performance by Jim Cavaziel (particularly during the time frame when he is imprisoned where we can really get to see his pain and suffering). Although him stumbling across an old wise prisoner who happens to possess all of the skills necessary to train him up to defeat his adversaries may seem a little clichéd and convenient this aspect of the story is still handled with sensitivity and some light-hearted exchanges were also evident from time to time.Once Dantes is free to exact his revenge then the film really steps up a gear and rarely loses momentum; although some aspects of the story are predictable there are still plenty of tense moments and the sensitive way that Dantes character is developed and the elaborate approach he uses to exact his revenge render the film a mostly satisfying product.The acting is generally good by all involved; Cavaziel is really good and acts as the heart of the film. Guy Pearce is every bit his equal through as his snivelly, conniving 'friend.' The supporting cast are all fine too and the film benefits from an early appearance from Superman himself - although I didn't realise it was Henry Cavill until after I had watched the film.Whilst I generally enjoyed this film, there were a couple of issues I had with the film; for a start when Dantes returns to exact his revenge under the guise of The Count of Monte Cristo I found it perplexing that no-one seemed to recognise him? I mean yes it was a good few years later and he had grown a goatee since but surely people would still recognise him? The film also didn't have as much swashbuckling in it as I had originally hoped, but in spite of this I still liked the film and thought the story was a good one and would say that it's worth catching if you come across it.",The Count of Monte Cristo
32,barnabyrudge,Satisfying revenge story from a famous book.,7,29 March 2004,"One of the most famous revenge stories, The Count of Monte Cristo is here turned into a dashing, old-fashioned swashbuckler. The plot is riddled with unconvincing coincidences and occurences (as indeed was the book), but other than that this is a well-made, enjoyable film, with some literate dialogue and believable action sequences. It is the fact that the action is believable that makes the film memorable, because in too many 2002 releases the action was so overblown and unrealistic (not to mention physically impossible) that the credibility of such films was destroyed.Edmond Dantes (Caviezel) is a honest young sailor working out of 19th Century Marseilles. His best friend Fernan (Pearce) secretly craves the hand of Dantes's fiancee Mercedes (Dominczyk), so he informs to the authorities that Dantes is a conspirator plotting to aid in Napoleon's escape from Elba. Dantes is sent to a terrible, inescapable island prison, while Fernan takes Mercedes to be his wife. After many years of hardship, Dantes makes an audacious escape and, having acquired a fortune by solving a cryptic treasure map, slowly plots his revenge under the new identity of the ""Count of Monte Cristo"".Caviezel was a relative newcomer when he did this film, but he really catches the eye as the innocent man driven to despair by his terrible and unjustified punishment. Pearce is good too, perfecting his arrogant sneer as the deplorable Fernan. The prison scenes are well shot, with the hopelessness and horror of the place captured in considerably believable detail. It's quite surprising that The Count of Monte Cristo was a relative disappointment at the box office, since its dramatic storyline, and the themes of revenge, betrayal and loss, are usually guaranteed crowd-pullers. This film deserves to be seen by more people, and the more people that see it the more its reputation will surely grow.",The Count of Monte Cristo

Along with everybody else I booed the bad guy, cheered the hero, sympathized with the romance, was warmed by the side kick's loyalty and gasped at the feats and coincidences. Ah, they do make movies like this anymore! This is my son's favorite book and my family was bound to see the movie so we could discuss it. (He discovered the book through reference to the author ""Dumb-Ass"" in ""The Shawshank Redemption"" that he watches every time it's on cable, which is about once a month, and has since been reading all of the Dumas books. I taped all of the French mini-series off cable, but of course didn't watch it, but he went through my piles of video tapes over school vacation and found and watched the whole thing. Then he complained bitterly that the 8 hours, with commercials, didn't begin to do the book justice so sneered at the previews for this new 2 hour version.)Jim Caviezel is simply marvelous, from naif to hairy prisoner to revengeful knight. But Guy Pearce was simply directed wrong to be supercilious. Usually actors tear up the scenery being a villain, so love doing it, but Pearce takes the foppish route instead of the Alan Rickman model, more's the pity. Richard Harris puts in another canny mentor role. The audience immediately recognized Luis Guzman, who usually plays Puerto Rican drug dealers, and got a big kick out of his amusing Sancho Panza, with his and other modern language asides put in for fun.The stunts and effects were effective and believable, while the music was unexpectedly unobtrusive.

Story is of course about Edmond Dantes (Jim Caviezel) who meets Napolean (Alex Norton) on the Isle of Elbe and he asks Edmond to take back a message to France and give it to a friend. He agrees and after getting back home his best friend Fernand Mondego (Guy Pearce) sets him up to get him locked away. Mondego is scheming with the Chief Magistrate J.F. Villefort (James Frain) and together they get him locked up at the Chateau d'lf where he will stay for the next 13 years and be subjected to beatings. One day while in his cell an old man tunnels up through his floor and introduces himself as Faria (Richard Harris). Faria gives him hope and together they continue to dig tunnels and Faria also teaches Edmond to read, write, fight with a sword and to become a more sophisticated person. Faria dies one day and Edmond switches places in the bodybag and is carried out. He escapes and heads to a nearby island where he meets a band of pirates who help him. There he meets Jacopo (Luis Guzman) who becomes very loyal to him and stays at his side. Edmond goes to the Island of Monte Cristo and finds the treasure that Faria told him about and now he is very rich. He becomes a Count and buys a castle where he invites all the socialites and comes face to face with his enemies but they do not recognize him after so many years but his old fiance Mercedes (Dagmara Dominczyk) seems not to be fooled. She has married Fernand and they have a son. Edmond seeks to get revenge on those responsible and he does it by making his enemies confess to their crimes. This film was directed by Kevin Reynolds who has given us ""Robin Hood"" and ""Waterworld"" and has worked a lot with Kevin Costner. He's a good and capable director and he does a good job here by never making this film dull and the story never drags. The cast is good and although having an American actor in the lead is questionable it still works well. Caviezel shows grit and determination in his role and he never seems to over do it which is what can happen in these period pieces. Pearce has really emerged in the last couple of years as one of the more interesting actors and he seems to be having devilishly good fun with his character. But I think Richard Harris might steal the film with his role as Faria. If anyone can teach a young man a thing or two it's Harris. This is not a great film and I thought it might have gone about 15 minutes too long but this is well made and it's a lot of fun to watch.",The Count of Monte Cristo

Actually I thought the strongest part of the movie was the prison sequence. Also there is great use of color and costuming - marvelous to behold. Cinematography is wonderful. However the lead actress did not really pull her weight very well. And the side-kick dagger-wielding body-guard was terribly mis-cast not sounding anything close to 18th century European Spaniard.

Dantes escapes the island, finds the treasure and proceeds to transform himself into the wealthy Count of Monte Cristo as part of his plan to exact revenge on all the people that once hurt him...If this had been a story written at the present time, it never would have been the same. Not only is this a good character study, it also takes the time to reach its goal. For example: Dantes doesn't take revenge by buying a gun and shooting down all his enemies. No, he takes his time, he waits until the perfect moment has arrived and than strikes back with an unimaginable force and originality which you might never expect. And not only the story is nice, so is the acting. I loved James Caviezel as Dantes / the Count of Monte Cristo. He portrayed the man very well, his performance was powerful, but never was it over the top. The other actors like for instance Guy Pearce, James Frain, Dagmara Dominczyk, Luis Guzmán... all were nice to watch too and even though I don't know all of them, they all did exactly what I expected from them, giving away a very nice performance.If there is one thing that I could remark, than it is the fact that all characters speak English. I know it's just a little detail and in the end it didn't really bother me, but it is still set in France, so I expected to hear all characters speak French (especially Napoleon). But as I said, it's only a minor detail and it certainly shouldn't spoil the fun.Because this is an action / adventure movie, you might think that you know exactly what to expect. Never could you be further away from the truth. This movie is a great surprise and I think I'm not exaggerating if I tell you that revenge has never been sweeter as in this movie. This certainly isn't the average action movie in which the hero blows a few enemies into a million pieces with a nuclear bomb. No, this is so much better, so much more well-thought out, that you are a bit disappointed once it is finished. Add to this some fine acting, some nice adventure and some beautiful landscapes and you know this is a movie that is above the genre's average in every possible way. That's also the reason why I give this movie at least a 7.5/10.",The Count of Monte Cristo
39,Lady_Targaryen,Prepare for adventure. Count on revenge.,9,17 February 2006,"''The Count of Monte Cristo'' is one of my favorite movies,and I really appreciate the tragic story of Edmond Dantes, seeking his revenge. I never read the book in which the movie was based, but I found the movie really awesome as well as many people who read the book actually loved the movie.(I think this movie is underrated, because it should be in IMDb's Top 250!)Edmond Dante is a loyal man, but unfortunately very naive and illiterate;when he meets Napoleon(who helps him to rescue Dante's captain) the ex Emperor asks him one favor: to give a letter to an old friend of him, called Clarion. Knowing that any sign of helping Napoleon to be in charge of the France again is crime,Edmond takes the chance,believing that the letter indeed is for Napoleon's old friend.When he comes again to his city, he is promoted to be the new captain of the Fairion, and happy, he goes to talk to Mercedes and Fernand about the news. Mercedes is also Edmond and Fernand's childhood friend, (but nowadays she is engaged to Edmond) and when Dante tells Mercedes about the news they decide to finally get married, since now Edmond will have a better payment. Jealous about Edmond's luck in life and wanting Mercedes for him, the rich Fernand stays angry and tells Danglas(another jealous man about Edmond's happiness)that he saw Edmond receiving papers from Napoleon, and together they both make a trap and send Edmond's to one of the worst prisons of France,being falsely accused of treason. Judge Villefort is one of the evil men who is behind Edmond's prison and also is a man full of dark secrets(one of them, the fact that Clarion, Napoleon's agent, is his father) and plans.Edmond stays many years in the prison and when he is losing his hope to get out of there, he meets Abbé Faria, a priest who is a veteran in the prison, and has a plan to get out of there digging a tunnel. They make an agreement: Edmond will help Abbé, if he teaches him all the things he knows. While they dig the tunnel, Abbé teaches Edmond how to read and how to write, as well as economics,philosophy,mathematics,science,Italian,logic and even how to use the sword and to fight. Soon Edmond will become one of the richest and powerful guys alive and will make his revenge for all people who made him suffer.I really recommend this movie because it is excellent! The message is positive as well, saying that when you persist in what you want, really having faith in your beliefs, things will happen to you.aka ""O Conde De Monte Cristo"" - Brazil",The Count of Monte Cristo
40,Luigi Di Pilla,I am surprised,8,12 July 2003,"It was better than I expected. The story offers all: adventure, revenge, pain, love, nice pictures and suspense. The photography was very fine. I discovered this movie in the US Box Office when it was launched and I was surprised by the high cumulative gross amounts. I find that this is the best remake ever made and I recommend it to everyone who likes films of Napoleon Bonaparte´s time. The film is very clear directed. Congratulation to Kevin Reynolds and to the actors Jim Caviezel and Guy Pierce who did a very great job. The act of revenge was similar to the one of ""Gladiator""; another masterpiece to not miss.

42,sme_no_densetsu,They hardly ever make 'em like this anymore,8,22 November 2008,"""The Count of Monte Cristo"" is a swashbuckling action-adventure based on the classic novel by Alexandre Dumas. In it, a naïve sailor (James Caviezel) becomes an unwitting pawn in a treasonous plot and is imprisoned for more than a decade as a result. After befriending another unjustly imprisoned man (Richard Harris) he devotes his life to escape and revenge on those who wronged him.The cast is not exactly star-studded, though there are some recognizable faces. Caviezel does an excellent job of portraying Dantes' transformation from simple seaman to the cold, calculating Count. Harris is reliable as always in a small role and Guy Pearce makes a fine villain. The rest of the cast is well-chosen and includes some interesting characters.I have not read the novel upon which this film is based but common sense will tell you that a 1000+ page novel needs major revisions to make it suitable for a two hour film. Judging the film on it's own merits, it delivers the goods with enough action for swashbuckling fans and enough drama to make it an absorbing tale of revenge. Jay Wolpert's script also includes a handful of memorable lines.Adding to the film's appeal, the compelling story is wrapped up in an attractive package. The direction & cinematography are surprisingly good, as is the score. The sword-fight choreography is also excellent and manages to convey a real sense of ferocity.If you're hankering for a good, old-fashioned swashbuckling action-adventure this is by far the best one in recent years. Don't let the lack of A-list names dissuade you from seeing it; this film is a diamond in the rough.",The Count of Monte Cristo
43,PatrynXX,"Not a bad movie, but there are better Dumas pix.",6,2 October 2002,"I thought the actor playing the Count (Jim Caviziel?) totally surprised me. I hadn't seen him act that good yet.  Frequency is still better, but he acts much better in this movie.(spoilers?)I had thought this was a rather good movie except that it's like watching The Mask of Zorro.  With this ""Oh I'm in prison for 20 years and I'm gonna kick someone's a**!"" And whereas Mask of Zorro makes a good show of it through out the movie. Monte gets out of prison (escapes) and the movie falls down on its feet. 
This disappointed me.  At times, the last half of the movies plot gets very vague.  Not alot of the story is thought out.  I haven't read Dumas' book, so I can't say if it's his fault or the screen writers.  But this detracts from the film.  Such movies as The Man in the Iron Mask or Revenge of the Musketeers (french)are much better than this.6/10Quality: 5/10 Entertainment: 9/10 Replayable: 9/10",The Count of Monte Cristo
44,baumer,I love this film!!,9,9 February 2002,"It's kind of strange, my wife and I just recently rented Rob Roy.  I remember hearing that it was quite good when it was released in the 90's. And although I can't say it was a bad film, I can't really say it was all that satisfying.  It had it's moments but it is not one that will linger with any real distinction in my mind.  Usually films in that time frame intrigue me and it was a little disappointing to see such an average film with a pretty good cast.  On the other end of the rainbow, you have this film.  Now even though this is not exactly the same time frame, it is that ""type of film"".  You know, old England, old France, old whatever.  It is pre-1900's.  I put all kinds of films into this category.  Anything from Braveheart to Man In The Iron Mask to Quills all falls neatly into this type of category.  Just like you would say anything from Nosferatu to Nightmare On Elm Street is horror, anything pre-1900 is in this ""type of film"" category.The Count of Monte Cristo is in one word, AMAZING.  There are two reasons I wanted to see this film.  One is the trailer had me completely intrigued and the second is because I really enjoyed the book and the film version of ""Sleepers"".  That was the Robert Deniro, Kevin Bacon, Brad Pitt, Dustin Hoffman and Barry Levinson film where several youths are sent to a boys prison for an innocent enough mistake that cost someone their life.  In the film the boys are tormented by Kevin Bacon and his entourage of prison guards and one of the things that keeps them going is the book, The Count of Monte Cristo.  When one of the boys is first given the book, he looks at the authors name and says, "" by Alexander Dumb Ass?"" and his friend replies, ""that's Doomaa, read it, it's about a guy that escapes from prison and takes revenge on the ones that hurt him.""  That is not the line verbatim, but you get the point.  Ever since seeing this film I have wanted to read the book. Never getting the opportunity to do so, when the film was advertised, I was, needless to say, excited.The Count of Monte Cristo is the ultimate tale of revenge.  It is a story that has stood the test of time because it is probably everyone's fantasy to right the unjust wrongs that have been comitted against them.  And oh what fun it is to imagine yourself finding a buried treasure and then making yourself a king or a count?  To have everything usurped from you only to take it all back twenty fold is not only intriguing, it is absolutely diabolical and gives you a sense of power.  Perhaps that is why the story transcends generations and time frames.  Because it is a story and a concept that we can all relate to, perhaps not out of experience but because we have all dreamed about it. A simple man makes a decent living, is thrown into prison for a crime he didn't commit and then escapes and finds some hidden treasure and becomes the richest man in the world and extracts revenge.  How can that not sound intriguing?This present version of Monte Cristo is masterfully made.  Kevin Reynolds, of Waterworld and Robin Hood fame, was given the director's chair and he doesn't disappoint.  There is enough action in here for all of us looking the for next great swashbuckling adventure and there is also a trace of romance and even some humour.  Jim Caviezel plays Edmund Dantes and Guy Pearce plays Fernand Mondego. Together, these two shine.  I wasn't a big fan of Caviezel's work thus far. I thought he was alright in Thin Red Line and Angel Eyes but his work in Pay It Forward as the homeless junkie really turned me off of him.  In Frequency he was quite good but that was the only film I could really recommend him in.  But I think that has all changed now that he has made this film.  He is perfect as the average peasant that works to achieve his goals and eventually as the man who has learned from the fountain of knowledge and takes his revenge.  Guy Peace, on the other hand is not even recognizable in his role as the insanely jealous best friend.  When you look at his last film, Memento and then see him here, you won't even realize this is the same actor.  He comes across as a jealous, scheming, whining son of a wealthy man that has been given everything to him on a silver platter.  One of the best lines in the film describing his acerbic disposition in life is when Mercedes ( the love interest in the film ) tells Fernando that when he was a little boy, he was upset when he got a pony and Edmund got a whistle because that whistle made Edmund happier that when Fernando had his pony.  He is perpetually unhappy and I'm not really sure what could give him any sort of concord.  He reminds me a little of the Tombstone character Johnny Ringo. Doc Holliday once described him a man who wanted revenge for being born. Perhaps Ringo and Fernand are distant cousins.A sure sign that you are enjoying a film is when you laugh at what is not even funny.  You are enjoying yourself to the point that you are anticipating with such joy at what is about to happen.  You know that sometime in the film Edmund is going to escape the prison that he is in and that he is going to find Richard Harris' treasure and extract revenge on the monsters that put him in prison.  But all the while you can't keep that goofy grin on your face.  There wasn't one moment in this film when I wasn't having a great time.  And that is not easy to do.  I think at times it is simple to become a cynic when you see as many movies as we all do.  I perhaps see a little more than the next person, so when so many films begin to tread down that familiar path that it usually does, the perpetual groans become standard occurences.  But this film kept me laughing, entertained and anxious to see the outcome.  I love this film.  This is on par with some of the greats like Raiders of the Lost Ark, Empire Strikes Back, Predator, Lethal Weapon and a few others that never stops the action.  There is nothing to dislike about it and there is every reason to recommend it.2001 was one of the weaker years that I can recall for the film industry. There were very few pictures that I really honestly enjoyed.  There were so many films that will take the infamous ephemeral dive.  Five years from now, ask anyone what the best picture of 2001 was and not many people will recall with reverance what films came out in 2001.  But here we are in the second month of 2002 and I have already seen two films that blew me away.  Mothman Prophecies and The Count of Monte Cristo are two films that I am proud to recommend to many of my friends.  I am sure I have made Mothman an extra couple thousand dollars because of my recommending it.  I hope I can do the same for The Count.  These are two films that people should not miss.  But seeing as this is a review for The Count, let's just end it by saying, I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!9.5 out of 10  Just see this movie.",The Count of Monte Cristo
45,marcin_kukuczka,"Interesting story, talented cast, simply a gorgeous movie!",8,12 April 2005,"""God will give me justice"" Accused of treason by his best friend Fernand (Guy Pearce), sentenced to hell in the prison of Château D'If, deprived of normal life and love of his girlfriend Mercedes (Dagmara Dominczyk); finally ... one of the most wealthy people on earth: Edmond Dantes known as count of Monte Cristo. I saw the movie by Kevin Reynolds for the first time during my trip to Italy with a group of people and most of them absolutely loved it. The movie made by the director of ROBIN HOOD-PRINCE OF THIEVES (1991), based on the book by Alexandre Dumas, memorably shows the complicated life of Edmond and his search for revenge. It is not only a simple movie, another adaptation of a novel, but truly a colorful movie, thrilling to watch throughout.The cast give fine performances, indeed. Jim Caviezel's portrayal of Edmond is truly memorable. Except for his later role of Jesus in Gibson's film, this is undoubtedly his second most remarkable performance on screen. Late Richard Harris as the old priest who teaches Edmond most skills, including fencing, gives a particularly touching performance, too. Sad that it has been one of his last roles. Michael Wincott memorably portrays Armand Dorleac's decadence and cruelty. Except for many other cast whom it is difficult to mention at once in one review, Dagmara Dominczyk as Mercedes is worth noticing. I am proud to say that such a talented and beautiful actress comes from my country, Poland.There are many wonderful moments in the movie, too, which are hard to forget. These are, particularly: the moment of priest's death and his words to Edmond: it doesn't matter you don't believe in God, He believes in you""; the visually stunning moment when Edmond escapes from prison after 13 years and suddenly appears on a beautiful coast; and finally, the final shot of count of Monte Cristo standing at the Château D'If giving the promise to the ghost of his best friend: what was used for revenge will now be used for good. It has a certain message conveyed. Edmond realizes that revenge does not give him happiness but all he wants is to be with those whom he loves.All in all, THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO is worth seeing. Without doubt, I find this film one of the best adventures and thrillers on screen. Although it is not equally entertaining as the novel (which is a rule for most, if not all, adaptations), it is really enjoyable thanks to a lot of aspects, including remarkable performances from the cast and great action. A precious piece of film art and a must see for all adventure lovers. 8/10.",The Count of Monte Cristo
46,one9eighty,Family friendly adventure - book purists beware,7,20 August 2018,"Directed by Kevin Reynold and starring Jim Caviezel and Guy Pierce in the lead role's, this is a new adaption of Alexandre Dumas' ""Le Comte de Monte Cristo"" - ""The Count of Monte Cristo"". A man is set up by a friend and falsely imprisoned by the authorities to keep knowledge he has safe from preventing a plot for power and greed (and lust). Left to rot for no nope or future nearly breaks him, if not for a random meeting with another prisoner. The random meeting leaves him with hope and also knowledge of a hidden treasure which could make him a new man - or fuel any plot for revenge. He does both, and after 11 years he escapes his shackles and reinvents himself as the Count of Monte Cristo to take his revenge against the people who wronged him. This is a decent and beautifully constructed film. I know that some purists aren't happy that it's not a action for action retelling of Dumas book but it still gets the gist of it decent enough - it's probably fairer to say this was inspired by the book rather than a direct version of the book . The flow and pace of the film is a little awkward at the beginning but once the film gets going and the jail break has occurred the pace is actually a blessing as it doesn't bother with a lot of the smaller things that aren't necessarily needed. Littered with a star cast the acting is top notch, there are some slightly camp showings, especially at times Luis Guzman as Jacopo, but in general the star cast deliver really well. Guy Pearce is instantly unlikable, and Jim Caviezel, once he's out of jail, is a brilliant conflicted lead. It amused me to see Henry Carvill in it looking soo young - but he still looks like the chisel chinned Superman all the same. I enjoyed the film, probably a little more than the 1975 version with Tony Curtis in, but probably not as much as the 1998 TV version with Gerard Depardieu in it. This is easily a family friendly film and is a good way to waste away lazy Sunday afternoons with a bit of swashbuckling action that isn't too intensive on the brain. 7 out of 10.",The Count of Monte Cristo

Fortunately for him, a fellow prisoner teaches him all that he knew and aids him to escape, while leaving him a hint to a great fortune. From there, he's free to unleash his revenge on those whose greed destroyed his life.It's a movie which simply excels in drama, presenting in detail the main character's harsh life behind bars without generating any boredom or lack of interest. It manages to keep suspense throughout its length, through its complex and well defined characters. The plot is also very good, especially until the finale, where it falls into a simplistic trap. I was mostly impressed by the prison scenes which make you feel bad for the main character and even worry about his faith. The finale is decent, but it could have been much better thought, without leaving the impression that it was rushed or that the producers remained out of original or unpredictable ideas. It's OK, but compared with the overall movie, it seems to lack depth.Overall, it's a very good movie, well thought and implemented, which proves to be a very good watch.

Pearce was outstandingly slimy-- even more so than Rules of Engagement.  But, then we come to the female lead: I found her weak, with tiring aspirated vocal expression-- to paraphrase the Irish playwright, Robert Sheridan, ""...like a frog with the quinsy!""-- albeit, she has a lovely face.

After thirteen years, Edmund alone escapes the notorious prison and seeks revenge on the men who betrayed him. The film is filled with lovable characters and hate-able characters. The plot focuses more on forgiveness then revenge and is filled with awesome plot turns and great sword play.Caviezel is great like always as the naive and vengeful Count of Monte Cristo. Pearce is just as good as Joaquin Phoenix in Gladiator (2000) as the main villain along with help from his conspirators Danglar and Villefort.

60,ozthegreatat42330,"An excellent movie, but not what the author intended",9,11 April 2007,"I find no fault with this film, as a film. It has a good cast, is well directed, and tells a good story. It is not, however, the Dumas classic that has thrilled people for almost two centuries. That is not the fault of the film makers. To do Dumas justice the film needs to be made as a miniseries to capture the complete and subtle flavor of the story and the many levels that must unravel for Dantes to achieve his just revenge. This film strayed quite a bit from that. The supposed friendship between the sailor Dantes and the soldier ( a commoner barely educated) in the book, Fernand did not exist. Dantes never met Napoleon and there was so much more subtlety to his scheme for revenge. In this version Danglars never rises to the prominence he achieves in the book, and much of the charity work that Monte Cristo carries out in the course of his plot is lost. It is not a black mark against just this film, the other two versions (with Robert Donat from the thirties and Richard Chamberlain in the seventies) all suffer from the same problem.The cast in this film perform well together. The settings were not as lavish in some parts as they might have been. But it is an entertaining film so I give it 9 out of ten.",The Count of Monte Cristo

65,Shiva-11,Pure entertainment!,7,27 January 2002,"Except for novels that I had to read for English 200 back in university (unless you count the time I read ""The Brothers Karamazov"" for fun - don't ask), most of my exposure to the literary classics came from the Classics Illustrated comics.  I always enjoyed the fact that they took great stories, cut through the chaff, made them easily accessible, enjoyable and I could be done in less than a half an hour.  Apparently directors read them too.Edmund Dantes is a simple man with simple desires, whose only goal in life is to save enough money so that he can wed his beautiful fiancee. Unfortunately, his belief in all that is good and trust in his friends are the very qualities that mark him as the perfect patsy.  Convicted of nonexistent crimes, Edmund is sent to die in a hideous hellhole that masquerades as a prison.  Bereft of hope, and having denounced god, there is only one thing that keeps Edmund alive -dreams of escape and revenge. 
I slipped into this film hoping that it would provide me with two hours of enjoyment - it greatly exceeded my expectations.  The Count of Monte Cristo is a film with something for everyone: romance, betrayal, intrigue, humor, sword fights  It embodies the spirit seen in the Indiana Jones trilogy - present the viewer with pure entertainment, and don't insult them. 
James Cavaziel's past performances have been less than stellar. More importantly, they have failed to demonstrate his dramatic range.  As Edmund, he is given the opportunity to create a character who undergoes stark changes, both physically and mentally: Edmund metamorphoses from a shockingly naïve, young man, to bitter, bedraggled wretch with a tenuous grasp on reality, and finally into a scheming Machiavellian rake.  The transformation is both smooth and believable.  Edmund's friend/foil is Fernand, played with aplomb by Guy Pearce.  Pearce is so despicably roguish, that you almost admire his as you're loathing him.  Richard Harris is wonderful as Faria, Edmund's grizzled sage advisor, confessor and trainer. The rest of the supporting cast also accord themselves well.The film succeeds largely because it does not take itself seriously - even the most dramatic scenes are played with tongue planted in cheek and it is obvious that the cast were caught up in this spirit.  In addition, the film is suitable for all ages - the violence is limited and largely bloodless, there is no coarse language and no nudity.  I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.",The Count of Monte Cristo

Allowing a book that is over four hundred pages long to be told in two hours.  And a very good two hours it is.The ending is pure hollywood however, which brings me to the major flaw I had with the movie.  Although the Count seems somewhat cold and calculating in this movie, in the book he is like a Cray, liquid nitrogen cooled supercomputer.  As remorseless as the hand of death itself.  At the very end of the book he starts to thaw, but is still a hard cold man. In the movie he dabbles in being cold, then warms then cools then warms.  Of course that might have to do with having a comic sidekick.All told the movie is what people want to see.  The changes to the story are because that is what the viewing public enjoys.

His encounters with the old man make a great story. 14 years of imprisonment justifies Edmond's rage, his lost faith and his endless desires to seek vengeance.I visited Chateau d'If in 2007 in Marseille. There is a small rock located a few hundred meters off the coast of Marseille with only the chateau built on it and there is no other place on the rock. In the film, the chateau looks the same but the island is very large. I don't know why the director wanted it to be that large. Maybe to give the impression of a deserted land.I have not read the book and no idea if the movie is consistent with it. Neither do I have any knowledge on how Napoleon was allowed to move freely on the island while being held captive. It is a fiction after all and a good one. Various versions have been filmed so far and newer ones will hopefully be filmed over time. In this one, the acting of Jim Caviezel and Richard Harris is great.

Kevin Reynolds (director of Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves as well as the notorious Waterworld) took that in mind when he decided to make his version of The Count of Monte Cristo  going straight to the source material for inspiration and story. Reynolds, who is no stranger to the whole Swashbuckler genre, managed to capture lightning in a bottle with this modern adaptation of his, making swords and sandals seem cool again - a full year before Gore Verbinski and his Pirates of the Caribbean exploded onto the big screen. Guy Pearce, an actor who truly shined in the early 2000's with hits such as Memento, The Time Machine and this (and suddenly dropped off the face of the Earth with no explanation); portrays Fernand Mondego, a sailor living in the post-Napoleon era. After being framed for treason by his close friend, Edmond Dantes (James Caviezel in his pre-Jesus days), Mondengo is sentenced to a life of solitude in a secluded prison which is located on an island. Years later, with the help of a fellow prisoner, he manages to execute the perfect escape (I'm sure the Prison Break creators were influenced by this one). A determined man, he returns to civilization while posing as a mysterious count, all the while setting his eye on reclaiming what was once his and avenging his false arrest.The Count of Monte Cristo is a truly remarkable retelling of a classical tale.

I think the Americanazation of the film was a bit its Aquiles heel. To my point of view, it would have been quite fine to see a French version, because French people are a bit more fantastic in their speech, in their acting, and I relate French with a concept of soft violence, of ""wiping one's ass with silk"" as said in Matrix. This kind of ideas were needed to make the film more powerful than it is. It's felt actings, the majestic lands and the art direction is to die for. A truly vivid spectacle.

There are so many other actors out there who could have done the job - and done so without saying ""I've swone to protek yoo."" In strong contrast, Caviezel and Pearce turn in their usual, brilliant performances. This film had potential but there were a lot of near misses. When compared with the above-mentioned 1975 version, the wrapping up of the tales of the three conspirators is extremely weak and there are various points where this film drops the ball.

Unlike the former, the latter is much less disturbing and sadistic.  The latter is also better acted, better written, and better plotted.  Herein lies small spoilers.  ""The Count Of Monte Cristo"" may not be the seminal revenge novel but it is the best known and best of all time.  Several film adaptations have been made and this one is quite possibly the best (it is the only one I have seen).  Jim Caviezel and Guy Pearce are currently two of the best method actors out there.  Jim Caviezel turns in an excellent portrayal as the once naive but eventually embittered protagonist Dantes.  Pearce plays the slimy and evil antagonist Mondego to perfection.  Both performances were reminiscent of some of my favorite films (Caviezel in ""Frequency"" and ""Angel Eyes"" and Pearce in ""L.A. Confidential"" and ""Memento"").  Watching these two battle wits to the point of using swords is almost seat-gluing.  The eventual sword fight at the end of the film will go down as one of the classic scenes of all time.  After viewing ""The Count..."", viewers should smile as opposed to feeling guilty because it is fun to see a man get deserved vengeance once in awhile.

The actors do a superb job and no detail was spared in the sets and costumes. The story is simple enough but is acted very well.

He is with the love of his life, Mercedes (Dagmara Dominczyk), and has his best friend, Fernand Mondego (Guy Pearce), by his side.  But his world is turned upside down when he is betrayed by his friend and framed for treason.Kevin Reynolds has given us such a great action film for only $35 million - relatively low in Hollywood nowadays.  He uses his resources wisely, creating a film which does not follow the novel but is good in it's own right.  For a while, I thought they should have given it a different title because it strays so much from Alexandre Dumas' book, but then they could be in hot water for plagiarism.  Too bad they released this in January, when movies tend not to fare very well.Caviezel finally gets to show off his acting skill here, portraying a multi-layered character with an intensity I didn't expect him to be able to muster.  Guy Pearce is, as always, a great storyteller, creating a Mondego that is truly a hateable character.  I don't know why people call doing the role the best he can overacting; it was not a subdued character by any means.Richard Harris seems to move through this film effortlessly, giving a performance so good that when I went home the evening of seeing this film I popped Camelot into the VCR just to watch him again.  Luis Guzman is perfect in his supporting role; I don't think the character would have worked with someone else in the role.  Dominczyk was also impressive in her screen time, but she did not get a great too many lines.  What a shame.To warn you ahead of time, this film does not follow the book.

I watched it anyway, because I read the back of the DVD cover and thought it sounded rather interesting.And it was very interesting.  The main character (I've forgotten his name) goes through the most terrifying trials and tribulations.  You can really feel for him as he gets thrown in jail for a crime he never committed and as he finds out who put him there.It's a very satisfying revenge plan, as we are given plenty of time to see what our hero has suffered.  It takes a while to get the movie going, but once it does it's almost worth it.  However, it just takes too long.  Some things could have been cut out.The relationship between the Priest and the wrongfully imprisoned ex-captain is what keeps the movie going.  They have both gone somewhat insane from being locked up for so long, and once they meet, the hope started rising in my gut.  I was starting to root for the guy.  That's really good when a movie does that.Our villain, played by the marvelous Guy Pearce, is not as nasty as he could be.  I didn't really hate him, but I continued watching the movie so I could see how he met his come-uppance.At first I thought the actor for the main character was annoying and whiny. After he escapes the prison, however, I realized that, no, the actor is not whiny or annoying.  He is a GOOD actor; leading me to believe he was really stupid is quite impressive.  The character's metamorphis, as well as the actor's to go along with it, is simply amazing.The Count of Monte Cristo is not a bad movie.  The only real flaw is how long it takes to get going.

87,boondocksaint20,A truly SATISFYING movie. What more could you ask for?,10,13 October 2002,"Love, betrayal, revenge...this movie has it all.  I must say, I had mixed reviews before I watched this movie, b\c Hollywood, well, has a way of screwing up epic stories by concentrating on certain elements instead of plot, character development and acting.  Throughout the movie, I was just waiting for a bad scene, corny actor, ambiguous plot thread to ruin it all...I am very pleased to say that this is by far one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  I have not read the book, but I knew the plot prior to seeing this which intrigued me in the first place. 
What can I say about this film?  It is one of those rare gems that GRIPS you from the very beginning and never lets go.  The acting is top notch, with my boy Guy Pearce giving an outstanding performance as the lead villan, and Jim Caviezel giving a surprisingly realistic portrayal of the misfortuned hero. The direction flows very nicely...there are plenty of action scenes and essential plot/dialogue scenes that all flow so nicely together...there aren't any scenes that drag on or are too short (save for the end, which I will get to later).  I've read reviews that bash this film for not staying 'true to the novel'. Well, from what I've read about the book, I don't think it is possible to cram all of the plot twists and adventures into a slightly over 2 hour movie.  Besides, the movie, despite some changes due to artistic license (and in the dvd segment of the screenwriter changing the book, compared to the book and movie versions, the changes really improve the story) is very true to the book from those I have talked to who have read it.  You can't help but cheer on Edmond throughout the film, since I know everyone can relate to this through some perverse fantasy at one time or another.  You know he's going to exact revenge in the end, but getting there is all the excitement.  The only worry one would have is if the filmmakers are going to get it right or not...in an epic story like this one, screwing up one scene can ruin the entire movie, and trust me, I was waiting for that one scene to happen the entire time I was watching it and it never happened.  I must say, that I was gripped, and on the edge of my seat, even laughing out loud in joy during some of Dantes' triumphs, especially the immortal line he gives to Villefort towards the end. ***MINOR SPOILERS*** The only thing that griped me a bit was the end.  Don't get me wrong, the end is very good and very very satisfying (a rarity in a movie these days), its just I'd like to have seen a little more of the characters' new lives flesh out a little more, so we can truly revel in Edmond's newfound happiness and newfound peace.  It just kinda ends like something you'd see on the Hallmark channel, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, just a little of a disapointment.  But, that is a minor gripe...I still found myself smiling at the end and relieved that there wasn't a tragic ending.  ***END OF SPOILERS***What else can I say?  This movie is great, simply put it is a masterpiece in filmmaking.  This one will definitely get you cheering out of your seat.  It has a wonderful romantic story in addition to a grit your teeth/guilty pleasure tale of revenge and vengeance.  There is even a wonderful message of spiritual faith in God which I thought was wonderful and appropriate. All in all, one of the best films to come around in a long time.

93,August1991,A False Adventure,3,24 August 2005,"Shortly after its release, I saw this movie in a cinema in Malta while on vacation. I thought it would be an extravagant blockbuster and rather than see a DVD version, I wanted to see it on the big screen, big sound and with an audience. I was disappointed, but I had fun finding the Maltese spots. Very small, Malta has varied geography - visible in the movie.The movie has good costumes, and sets too. Production values are top-notch. Nevertheless, I found it boring and the sword fights bogus.If you have read Dumas, this movie bears no relation to the novel. Do not use this movie as the basis of a book report. Characters are added, changed, eliminated. A child has a new father. Worse, the screenwriter's attempts to make Dumas more dramatic fall flat. The whole effort is an attempt to render Dumas commercial for an audience of American 17 year olds, circa 2002. This movie is a travesty, and in a few years, it will be a pathetic joke - if it is not that now.",The Count of Monte Cristo
94,210west,Revenge tale is refreshingly old-fashioned,10,12 June 2003,"It may not have cleaned up at the box office and it may not have bowled over every critic, but had this version of the Dumas novel been made in the '40s or '50s, it would be hailed today as a classic adventure film.  I'm not a Dumas fan -- in fact, I've never seen a ""Three Musketeers"" I could stand, except perhaps for the Richard Lester spoofs  -- but I thought this ""Monte Cristo"" was splendid, an exciting, honorable, intelligent, beautifully mounted film I'll want to watch again and again.  Dumas's novel is of course the quintessential revenge story, and what impressed me the most is that this film plays it absolutely straight, without a single false note or a single descent into campiness; you might say, at the risk of sounding paradoxical, that it's refreshingly old-fashioned. Jay Wolpert's witty adaptation is true to the spirit of the novel while actually improving on it in places; Jim Caviezal makes a thoroughly convincing hero -- he's especially affecting in the first half, noble yet initially naive -- and Guy Pearce is a fine foppish, supercilious villain.  Equally impressive is the production: gorgeous sets and picturesque Mediterranean backdrops.  Watch this one with your son while he's still young enough to be charmed by an earnest, uncynical, old-fashioned adventure tale.",The Count of Monte Cristo

96,johnmbale,Not the Definitive Monto Christo.,6,27 February 2005,"A competent although finally unremarkable adaption of the exceedingly long complicated Dumas novel. The story concerns the sinister revenge of Edmund Dantes upon those who plotted to wrongfully imprison him in the dreadful Château d'If for eighteen years. The clever manner in which he carries out his revenge in the guise of The Count of Monte Christo after escaping and finding a massive treasure trove is well told in the book, with many subplots and intrigues, which are hard to bring to the screen in a limited time frame. One must however compare this adaption with the excellent 1998 French TV series starring the impressive Gerard Depardieu (as a rather overweight Count), which remains the most satisfying version so far. It does have longer running time to expand aspects of the plot and character development however. James Caviezel tries hard to make something of his role as Dantes, but there are moments which fail him. When he and Richard Harris meet in the depths of the prison, they unfortunately remind one of characters from a Monty Python sketch. Given the limits of time, and some rather unfortunate scripting together with a hotch potch of accents, the results are adequate and should appeal to those people not familiar with the book, and those who like the look of the cast. The Hollywood origins are offset a little by some pleasant enough historical backgrounds that set the scenes. By no means the definitive Monte Christo (which may be yet to come), for those having the patience and time the Depardieu version is far more rewarding.",The Count of Monte Cristo

98,sonnyschlaegel,"Not true to the book, but it's great",9,15 October 2006,"(Warning: spoilers) Usually I prefer adaptations that are true to the original story, but this adaptation is an exception. Even the ending has been changed (which isn't a very good idea), but everything else is well done in my opinion.There's no Caderousse, no Haydée, no Maximilien Morrel, no Benedetto. The core of the story, however, is still there. Edmond stands in the way of Mondego, Danglars and de Villefort. They send him to prison (but he's innocent of course). After many years, he manages to escape, and he begins his revenge. He doesn't want simply to kill his enemies because that would be to easy for them. He himself has suffered long, so they have to suffer long, too. (I found Jacopo's comments on this very funny because they add (self-) parody to the story.) The moral question (does God allow vengeance?) that is so important in the novel is also included in this adaptation.Dantès executes his revenge in a way that is different from that in the novel, but the plot changes work well, so the movie is interesting to watch. The acting is good (I liked Richard Harris very much), too, so I think I can recommend this movie. If you want to watch a version of the story that is nearer to the original you might try the version with Chamberlain or the one with Depardieu (it's long (a mini-series) and good, but they have changed the ending in that version, too.)",The Count of Monte Cristo

Then his career went into a major sag with movies like ""187"" and ""Waterworld"" that were incoherent, incompetent, boring, and worst of all, mean-spirited. He has finally found his comeback and redemption with this wonderful film. He moves the adventure along at a brisk pace, gives us great and involving characters that we can cheer and jeer enthusiastically, and (in the third act) creates beautiful set pieces that are nothing short of feasts for the eyes. Watching the colorful and energetic party in Rome that Mondego's son attends and the lavish parties that the ""Count"" hosts to reel in his enemies, I wanted to stay forever in the world that this movie creates. (Sidenote: if you appreciated the gorgeous set pieces this movie creates, you absolutely must see the 1996 Robert Downey Jr. movie ""Restoration"").  And the final 30 minutes of this film are spellbinding: as Edmund's revenge plan is carried out like clockwork, the viewer must take a certain amount of guilty delight in how thoroughly and perfectly he exacts his vengeance. With all the crap in theaters right now (Crossroads, Slackers, etc.), seeing this movie made me feel like... well, like Dantes does sitting on a sunlit beach after escaping 15 years in that dark, torturous prison.",The Count of Monte Cristo
101,dorotka24,"Thrilling, intelligent adventure",9,5 November 2007,"I've been skimming through the poor reviews of the movie and they all have one thing in common - all read the book and all hated the adaptation. I can appreciate that sentiment, to an extent, and have not myself read the book.So it is with a completely unbiased mind that I was able to sit through and completely enjoy this underrated gem. Revenge is a timeless theme that never really gets tired, and the execution here is much more deliberate than in most modern films. It was somewhat reminiscent of Homer's Odyssey or Shakespeare's Hamlet in that revenge was carried out in a very indirect and protracted manner.Many would argue that such is merely a plot device used to stretch out what could be an otherwise short tale, but I disagree. I feel that it only helps to display the protagonist's intelligence and patience in order to re-establish his role in society and win general respect and admiration that would assist him in the aftermath should his plans succeed. But make no mistake, the pacing here is tight, with action sprinkled liberally throughout, leading to the exciting finale.Despite the ample thrills, the centerpiece to me were the characters. Richard Harris and Luis Guzman in particular had very endearing side characters that added greatly to the film's flavor.I cannot think of many flaws here. The end, though very good, did unfold a little too quickly and should have perhaps focused on the main characters instead of so deeply involving two side characters. This is really very minor, though, and did raise the stakes of the finale a bit. It certainly did not detract at all from my enjoyment. Highly recommended.",The Count of Monte Cristo

But given that the book can stack well next to a phone book, it would take six hours to do the whole story justice.  I saw a 'faithful' attempt in the Richard Chamberlain version and that was sad crunching of scenes that left little room for meaning to be taken of them. Consider also, a faithful climax would call for at least another half hour to set it in motion.Jim Caviezel never disappoints me with his performances, and this one had me swimming in awe, almost to the point where I didn't notice the solid performances by Pearce and Harris.  Get Jim more work!The whole movie has you rooting for Dantes to get his revenge and his woman (and then he finds out, HIS SON) back.

103,iconians,Fairly decent adaptation of what could have been better,8,28 January 2002,"This article might have some spoilers from the movie so read it at your risk..First of all i have to admit that making a movie from one of the greatest stories(in my humble opinion) had to be pretty hard.While this movie only about 2 hrs and few min long, i believe that if it was maybe a bit longer (perhaps 2 1/2 hrs) it would have been much better.The reason that the book was 'soooo' popular wasnt only the story it was also those intricate details which made the story so good. In the movie it was pretty hard to show such affection for mercedes to dantes in few minutes that they show them together.The other parts of the movie were only shown at short periods to portray the gist of the book without the feeling of it. The years that dantes and faria spend together as dantes learned to read and write, to fence as well as other subjects which made him a very smart person in the future...If i can use a movie like shawshank redemption to show an example of how a movie can show a person being in jail while to be similar period of time(13 and 17 years i believe),i believe shawshank redemption made a much better point to show the main characters struggles, and his masterminding of the plans of the future.I dont really want to go and b***h along as you dear readers might assume, but maybe i do so since i enjoyed the book much more than the movie and i feel that this movie was entertaining but same time didnt do justice to the book.Now, dont get me wrong movie was pretty good, nice adaptation, good action, mediocre love story, but thats all it was, when it could have been a great story..If you least liked the movie but want 10 times more then i urge you to read the booki given this movie 6 out of 10(since they did try to stick to the story not like other people who wanna use it name and make a new story)",The Count of Monte Cristo

105,Servo-11,Fun in the old swashbuckling tradition,9,29 January 2002,"This is no ground-breaking film and there is no need for it to be.  This is escapist entertainment, pure and simple, but it (thankfully) lacks the common escapist elements of recent years of mind-numbing explosions, gunfire, and yelling.  Monte Cristo harkens back to the Golden Age of Hollywood where Errol Flynn crossed swords with Basil Rathbone and won Olivia de Havilland in the end.  The plot is as old as time and was once the most popular play on the American stage.  I was completely unfamiliar with the plot, but as I watched the movie, I knew exactly what was going to happen next.  Far from being annoyed by this, I thoroughly enjoyed myself. The old Errol Flynn movies had paper-thin plots as well, but it was the personalities that made it worth watching and in this version of Monte Cristo, the actors are eminently watchable.  Jim Caviezel is the sympathetic hero, manipulated at first by his enemies, but ultimately becoming the architect of his destiny.  Guy Pearce evokes memories of past villians who were badder than bad, their sarcasm as deadly as their motives or their sword.  Richard Harris was a delight and, along with Luiz Gusman, contributed the right amount of levity to the dark drama.  The only performer who could have improved their performance was Dagmara Dominczyk. She had very limited mobility of expression and was quite pale and forgettable.  Her habit of barely moving her lips, resulting in a monotone voice quickly grew tiresome.  But since the female characters in these dramas are in general uninteresting, I expected little more than what she gave.  I thought the sets and costumes were extremely well-chosen and photographed and the action moved at a good pace.  I sat in the theater with a big smile on my face and didn't feel cheated of my money.  I hope this movie will jumpstart more entries in the swashbuckler genre.  This and the Bandares Zorro are completely worthy of Errol Flynn's crown.9/10",The Count of Monte Cristo
106,tomquick,screenwriters move like flies to honey....,6,5 June 2006,"I was disappointed with this movie, but not as disappointed as I thought I would be. The Château d'If scenes are quite good, especially Richard Harris as Faria, and Caviezel is as good here as he is in the Passion.The disappointment was more in seeing how the original story was treated. The romance between Mercedes and Dantes somehow grabs screenwriters and makes them all want to turn a complex story of betrayal/redemption/loyalty into a simple story of love and revenge. The word ""Dumas"" makes the writers want to turn the story into an action film (the video store clerk had to redirect me to that section to find it), but unfortunately this story has more in common with Doctor Zhivago than it does with The Three Musketeers. Beyond this, there are elements of the story that the writers don't seem to want to touch at all. It's no doubt harder to sell the count as a hash smoking slave holder than as the randy father of an illegitimate son. (By the book's time line Mercedes would have had to have been pregnant for at least 2 years for this to happen....). The drama of sword fights plays better on the screen than the greater dramas in the novel of a duel between the Count and Albert that never takes place, Fernand blowing his brains out, and Mercedes returning to Marseilles to live alone.I've been waiting patiently for a faithful remake of To Have and Have Not.

107,gray4,The worst film version yet of Dumas' great tale,4,8 April 2004,"The Count of Monte Cristo is such a great story that it should be impossible for a director to make a boring version of it. But that is Kevin Reynolds' achievement. The sets are sumptuous, with good use of the Maltese locations. But the story limps along for over two hours.Part of the trouble is that almost everyone knows the story before they see the film. So character is important, and the leading actors, with the sole exception of Richard Harris (copying Ian McKellen as Gandalf!), are dull and unconvincing. The story depends on a convincing build-up to the revenge extracted by the Count, and this doesn't happen. Instead of the novel's one-by-one picking off of his enemies, the film drags for two hours then rushes to an implausible finale, capped by one of the most inept sword fights in movie history. If you enjoy the thrilling Dumas novel, give this version a miss.",The Count of Monte Cristo
108,uroshnor54,Fairly Entertaining,5,10 January 2015,"****(This review has spoilers for both the book and the movie.)****The Count of Monte Cristo is probably my favorite book of all time. It has many interesting and memorable characters and an intricate plot. I think a proper adaptation of this book would probably take around 9 or 10 hours. Obviously, this movie isn't that long so it would have been very unfair to expect it to stick very close to the novel. I didn't and I thought it was fairly entertaining. I didn't really mind many changes to the novel.I liked the performances of Jim Caviezel and Guy Pearce. But I did not like Dagmara Dominczyk as Mercedès. She doesn't speak her lines. She breathes them, probably because she thought that would make them sound more dramatic. Most of the other actors were alright. I'm no expert on what 19th century France looked like and how French people who lived during that time dressed like, but I thought the sets and costumes were good. I also liked the soundtrack.There were some changes to the novel that I'll admit I don't think should have been made. Albert should have been Fernand's son, not Edmond's. In the book, Albert is shown to be brave and honorable in contrast to his father and he has to come to accept the fact that his father's sins aren't his own. Making him Edmond's son kind of takes away the drama in all that. Also, the part of Danglars is too small. This was probably done to develop Villefort more. I thought Danglars was a more important villain in the book and if they were going to cut out the whole subplot with Benedetto/Andrea Cavalcanti, they should have just made Danglars's part larger and shrunk Villefort's.One change from the book that I did like was that Edmond married Mercedès and adopted Albert. In the book, Mercedès becomes a nun, Albert goes to Africa to fight a war to regain his honor, and Edmond marries a girl who is, if I remember right, about half his age, which I thought was a bit disappointing. So, overall, this movie isn't all that bad if you're not expecting it to stick very close to the book.",The Count of Monte Cristo

What I expected was a frame by frame accurate retelling of the story with modern day technology to make everything look right, but without necessarily being any more interesting than most Hollywood flings these days. Luckily my expectations was put to shame. I was hooked immediately by this riveting retelling of the story. From the superb actors in the leads, to every bit character, they all deliver.

111,dbogosian-1,"Very enjoyable, excellent period feel",8,2 September 2008,"Turning this story (~1300 pp in the original book) into a two-hour movie is nothing short of impossible; imagine Lord of the Rings (roughly the same page count) compressed into two hours and you get a sense of how much of the book is lost when it becomes a movie. Nevertheless, if you can leave aside the need for complete parallelism, this is a very satisfying and enjoyable movie.The story centers about a man wrongly accused and incarcerated, the improbable circumstances by which he achieves his freedom and sets about getting revenge on those who tried to destroy him. It's all set in the early 1800s, in France, and very beautifully shot in a number of gorgeous locations. The movie does a great job of conveying the ""feel"" of the era: costumes, settings, props, all are very well done. There tension and mystery are well sustained, even though we all know where things are headed.Caviezel (who plays the lead) does an excellent job portraying the ""nice"" side of Monte Cristo, but he seems to not have enough venom and hatred to really convey the vengeful side of the character. Still, he carries the burden of the movie and does it skillfully. The supporting cast are all excellent. One other flaw is that the aging of the characters is not in the least convincing. Decades are supposed to go by, but everyone still looks as supple and lovely as they ever did.This movie is well worth seeing, not only for its own sake, but because it will stimulate you (as it did me) to pick up the book and read it (again).",The Count of Monte Cristo

114,Ore-Sama,Bottom Feeding Trash Not Fit To Be a Door Stop,1,20 March 2008,"Alexander Duma's tale about an innocent man locked away only to escape and take vengeance on those who locked him away is turned into a putrid exercise in absurdity with this god awful adaptation.The film opens with Dante and his friend Fernando landing on an island where they get into a Disney esquire scuffle with British troops where they lay waste to most of them with the masterful tactic of repetitively blocking their swords and punching them. Wonderful, I can already write a paragraph or two on what is wrong with that. Oh, and I love how we find most of the men were wounded from punches. Dantes and Fernando should be boxers with those kinds of punches.It's clear the writer just took the book and threw it out the window after the beginning, after making Dantes one of the dumbest and most gullible protagonists I've seen in some time.Oh it only get's better. The main villain becomes some bland throw away villain not even in the book. Most of the major characters are absent for the most part. The villains have been simplified beyond belief and Dante's revenge on them lacks any imagination what so ever. All these intertwining back stories and characters, gone. What we get instead is a simple film for simple minds, a far cry from the novel. Dante's plans are so simple in the movie, his revenge seems little more then an afterthought. It's hardly satisfaction when revenge is finally achieved.Did I mention the horrible acting? These actors are mediocre at best...if you're comparing them with performers in an elementary school play. What about the bland cinematography? What about the inane plot twists and devices thrown at us that come at such a rapid rate it's almost like the writer is trying to kill every last brain cell in our bodies.Anyone who tells you this film is in anyway accurate to the book is either lieing or a fool. The book had more themes to it then simply revenge. That's all this movie is about, the revenge, not going into any depth about Dante's character and what this desire has done to him. The plot is nowhere near the same for the film and the book, they are so far off it's laughable.Oh, did I forget about the fight scenes? Crap, utter crap with all the imagination of a dead rat. Also, the ending, the worst part. A crap movie needs a crap ending, where all the dumb writing from before is kicked into overdrive, presenting one of the most utterly asinine moments I've seen in awhile.

I have to admit, having gone in with little expectation, i was flawed!  This was one of the better movies that i have seen in a long time.  Jim Caviezel's performance is slightly whiny to begin with, but in the context of the whole story, the reason therefore is appreciated and makes his transition and growth as a character that much more riveting to watch.  I absolutely loved him as Edmund Dantes then the dynamic Count of Monte Cristo and cannot have imagined a better choice.  He was definitely not bad on the eyes either.  Every scene had him looking more dashing and more handsome than the one before.Guy Pierce surprised me with a performance that was totally believable.  His dry humour only made him more appealing, very well acted.The entire epic, though long, never gives you the impression that you have been sitting still for ages.  It moves along swiftly and always had me gripped, from the action, suspense, and even to the humour that was evident from time to time.  The love story surprised me most of all.  Instead of taking on a highly sexual slant, as all these new films do, it was understated, the female lead doing an admirable job of portraying the wounded lover, who has always longed for her Edmund.

It looked much better in theaters, where the spectacle of a man coming in on a hot-air balloon was a memorable moment unto itself, but the fight scenes are brilliantly choreographed to bring you into the action, and the story is so multilayered that you need to see it again (or read the book) to catch everything.The performances from Guy Pearce's diabolical role as Mondego, Jim Caviezel's not particularly stunning yet honest portrayal of Edmond Dantes, to the cameo of Michael Wincott as the sadistic warden of the Chateau D'If, and Luis Guzman's somewhat humorous performance--each is done with just enough to keep the story going. Kevin Reynolds, who's most famous previous movie was ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,"" has, in my opinion, eclipsed his previous success with a movie totally lacking in any modern-day special effects, instead opting to tell a story in the style of the old Errol Flynn and Robert Donat movies of the 1930s.I like to watch good fencing every now and then, and this movie combines enough of that, political intrigue, period settings and history, and fine performances to set the scene for a great swashbuckler.",The Count of Monte Cristo
123,scootmandutoo,This is NOT the Dumas novel.,1,30 August 2010,"This adaptation of The Count Of Monte Cristo is not watchable to anyone who has read the classic novel. I read the novel for the first time last year, after hearing a snippet of the Orson Welles old-time radio version (which was probably a bastardization in itself).After reading the book I learned that none of the movie versions, or the serialization of it, had been true to the novel.They ALL apparently change the ending to make it a Hollywood ending (not that the original novel doesn't have a satisfying ending on its own merits). But, when you have read the book, what they have done in the movie version is unforgivable.I caught this one on cable this evening and, I must say, the last hour was unbearable. Dumas must be rolling in his grave. They TOTALLY rewrote the book.I think this has been done, because it is a difficult novel to start getting into (though the reward for those who do is great). So, the reference point for most people is the film from the 30s, which also apparently was not true to the Dumas story.It is one thing to leave out some plot elements...this is too sprawling of a novel to film. It is better to do it as a mini-series (though when that was done, they also changed the book apparently...for some bizarre reason). But this book, totally changed the ending and message of the book and thus, eliminated all the meaning of the novel.Had I not read the book, I could have enjoyed the film on its own merits, but this is NOT the classic Dumas novel.If you have seen this without reading the book, do yourself a favor, read it. Trust me, nothing has been given away. It will be like discovering a completely different story.

Forinstance, the action sequences are passable, the Chateau D'If isappropriately dank (oooh, quite a cinematic achievement, that), therevenge-payoff scenes didn't entirely fail to provide a meagersense of satisfaction, and Guy Pearce (who I usually love) didn'tfail to act villainous.  
But this really wasn't a good movie.  The script sapped any senseof grandeur out of the Dumas novel, resulting in a screenplay thatreminded me of a low-achieving high school student paraphrasing the Cliff Notes of The Count of Monte Cristo.  Thelame attempts at action-blockbuster, Bruce Willis one-linersseemed patently out of place in this period piece.  And to tell thetruth, most of the actors lacked the talent that would have beennecessary to hide the script's inadequacy.   Jim Caviezel'swooden, Malkovician delivery seems intended to be chilling, butit's just flat and stiff.

The brilliance of this movie will be grossly over shadowed by the book, if one chooses to read it.This movie will not disappoint. It is satisfying and does not take itself too seriously.

Guy Pearce as always is fantastic, though he has little to do except play a pantomime English villain (who's French, natch).

Fernand Mondego (Guy Pearce) is wonderfully wicked.  (He has such a snotty way of talking, you want to smack him.)  The movie is only slow up until Dantes meets the ""Priest"" (Richard Harris), whose character is both intelligent and comical.

Also, the costuming, set design and cinematography were very good.  Thus, it was a real mixed bag for me.  The flaws involved what I consider to be (1) an inferior script, which includes some modern phrases (and even cliche);(2) the fact that while in a hell-hole of a prison, subsisting on two ladles of soup per day and an occasional rat, both Richard Harris and the title character have well-fed and nourished bodies, which would not have been so obvious if there were no scenes shot of open or missing shirts; (3) the female love interest doesn't age, but everyone else does; (4) the Count's teeth are noticeably bad in prison, but white again shortly after his escape without any plausible explanation; (5)a pirate and the title character hug one another, which I found laughable even though it was supposed to be serious; (6) there is a hot air balloon descent scene in which there is no source of hot air; and the staged assembling of characters at the climactic scene is preposterous.  These flaws, along with some other insults to the intelligence in this movie, keeps it from being a truly solid cinematic experience.  4 points on a scale of 0 to 10.",The Count of Monte Cristo

I'll completely honest, I did not see the last half-hour of this film because I was disgusted by everyone and everything involved with the film and I had no desire to see the badly shot/acted/edited/ect. ending.

I generally dislike any movie set other than those set in the past or in the future, but ""Monte Cristo"" stunned me. Not having previously read the story by Alexandre Dumas, I was very pleasantly surprised by this theatrical offering.  Guy Pierce, as usual, is fantastic, portraying a privileged, over-indulgent noble, while Cavaziel was as memorable as he was in the only other movie of his which I have had the pleasure of viewing (""Frequency"").  This is a classic tale of revenge.  It features enough action to hold the interest of younger viewers like myself, features a wonderful appearance by Richard Harris as the Count's mentor, beatiful scenery, and an authenticity rarely seen in modern set-pieces.  The entire movie proves practically flawless and inexorably entertaining as events come to a close.  I would recommend this fine work for those of all ages.  This is truly a special film.",The Count of Monte Cristo
134,shushens,Not Satisfying to the Readers of the Original Novel,7,12 January 2008,"Naturally, when a film is made based on a timeless classic, either people prefer not to look much into it, or they go to the theatres with great expectations. Back where I live, probably only a few people know The Count of Monte Cristo. I am a big fan of his.For those like me, this film did not have enough drama. It did try in places to show the sustained cold anger and lust for revenge Edmond Dantes cherished within. He did not have anything else to live for, so the plan of revenge was his everything. Like ladylove, when revenge becomes your life, it needs care, nourishment, frequent checking, and protection. It was portrayed in such Machiavellian way in the book, I was satisfied, thinking ""Yes, if you really want to avenge your past, then do it like this, or don't do it at all!"" The film lost a lot of that charm. Of course, no one really expects a director of late 20th century to be of the same league as Dumas's, but still it could have been made a lot more dramatic than it has been. Some scenes, like the one where Dantes fights Jacopo, look like they have been made is sheer haste because the crew had a deadline to meet. This movie could smell of revenge; unfortunately, it did not.I still give this film a 7 because of Jim Caviezel's performance. He single handedly takes this motion picture from the designation of a b-movie to the identity of a classic film. B-movies like these are made often, in US and Latin America as well as in Spain. This one is, indeed, different.Finally, I would say, it is a film definitely worth watching, because this is as good as a silver screen adaptation of the timeless classic gets.",The Count of Monte Cristo

This version made it all so easy to understand, the plot just flowed, everything made sense and everything was completely believable. The cinematography was spectacular, the casting perfect. I thought the music could have been better, the dancing was poor at best, and I didn't care for the long robes the count was given, but these were minor things compared to everything else that was RIGHT in this movie.

Its should be no surprise to film fans because Reynolds was also the man behind the highly entertaining Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves.  The first thing this film gets right is that it does not get hung up in it's adaptation of the source material.  It does not try to copy the novel, by Alexander Dumas, word for word, nor does it try to cut and paste highlights from the book and tie it together with some weak dialogue.  Instead, the film-makers take the main characters and the main theme from the novel and expand it into a dramatic story about passion and revenge.  And much like the adventure movies of old it rewards the audience first with a good story and solid performances by the actors and then with a spectacle of the evil-doers coming to justice in the end.The film throws in some elements that are not in the book but they help in building the film's drama.

Of course, Richard Harris does his usual superb job and gives his character a life that somewhat transcends the rest of the film.  The rest of the cast does an adequate job.  Some of the cinematography is quite good but does little to overcome the plodding, drawn out pace.

The film is adequately paced, for how it's made. The acting performances are good; Jim Caviezel and Richard Harris were good. Guy Pearce looked like a miscast. Henry Cavill was okay. I think Dagmara Dominczyk as Mercédès gets overlooked; she did a good job in her character.The film has good action, drama, and thrills throughout, making it a good entertainer. Read the novel too!

I've never read the book, but I can see why it is such an important piece of literature. The story was riveting and had me at full attention all the way through.

I noticed similarities when Anthony Hopkins snuck out of prison as Diego in the Mask of Zorro. Then one of my friends brought up a tape, handed it to me, and said, ""Watch this.""  Tonight, I did, and I must admit that it was excellent.  The talents of the gentleman actor who played Dantes are perfect--I believed in Dantes' character the whole way through the script.  Guy was just evil in his portrayal--especially when Ferdand  and Mercedes were separated by railings in the Paris mansion discussing the end results of that morning's activities, and he replies that it's liberating.  I was delighted to hear about Albert's parentage.  Coming, as per usual to the IMDB site, I just ~had~ to look up the movie to find out who the warden was and I was not disappointed.  This role was just a long line of roles in movies I liked: 1993's _Three Musketeers_ and _Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves_.  He plays nasty so well.  Paraphrasing: I don't have anything better to do all day cracked me up.Harris, as usual, is a pleasure to watch with his smooth voice, and fluid acting.

144,Fox in Socks,Been done better,5,29 April 2002,"I can't help thinking that French versions of this genre always work better. They have the right accents, for starters, but they also look a hell of a lot better - more swashbuckling, more cleavages, more big dresses, big hair, big shirts, and more moustache-twirling villains. This featured too many British people pretending to be French, something we're not very good at.Still, it wasn't bad at all, and at least it had Michael Wincott doing what he does best - sadism with a smile. See him as the villainous Moxica in the otherwise uninteresting 1492, the villainous but underused Rochfort in The Three Musketeers, or indeed the villainous Top Dollar in The Crow.  Guy Pearce was good too, and has come a long way since Neighbours.You can forgive a few changes to a classic, but what was hard to swallow was the clumsy insertion of a heavily religious message which was absent from Dumas's romance and every other film version.

145,dianefhlbsch,The Count of Monte Cristo – Touchstone version – 2002- Skip it!,2,5 January 2011,"This film has truly beautiful sets, magnificently choreographed and performed fight scenes, and exquisite photography. Too bad the rest is a pile of garbage. The young cast gave acceptable, but nothing spectacular, performances. I found myself watching it only to see how many idiotic mistakes the screenwriter and director had made.When a film is based upon a preexisting piece of literature, particularly when the film bears the same title, I do expect it to be faithful to the original. Sometimes a screen play can actually improve upon it, or reflect more modern sentiments. This one did not. Jay Wolpert took a classic adventure of the heart, mind and soul of a person and attempted to turn it into a swashbuckling adventure. The result is a hideous mutilation that attempts to contrive a happy ending. Here is a hint: retribution is rarely neat; nor does it have a happy ending. (Dumas missed these two points as well, which the 1974 version did bring out very nicely.) Dumsas's hero is a loyal,respectful but ambitious, intelligent but naive, working class fellow,who is willing to work hard and honorably earn his advancement, but is not a social climber. THIS version has him as plain stupid and immature, without any evidence of having earned a promotion. It also chose to focus on class struggle, which was a minimal point in the original novel, actually made our hero guilty, and missed the fact that everything our socially prominent adversaries have is based upon falsehoods and manipulation. All of these missed points are critical to the story, as well as the fact that there are fates worse than death.This version also did a very poor job depicting the passage of time. They cast young actors, but forgot to age them physically, mentally and emotionally. For this, I call the director (Kevin Reynolds) to task. Perhaps they should not write or direct a film which they are also producing. It can blind oneself to the truth. And the truth is that this film is a waste of time.

Regardless, this movie is absolutely wonderful and tragically underrated.This is a lengthy movie that takes full advantage of every minute to create atmosphere, character development, and the delightful intricacies of a dark tale of revenge and justice.I won't say that all of the performances were top-notch necessarily, but the performances of the lead protagonist and antagonist are almost sublime in their grim determination and passion for their respective character's roles and many of the other characters are portrayed with excellent skill and, in some cases, flawless comedic timing.Visually, it's a breathtaking movie.

Well, oddly enough, it takes Kevin Reynolds, whosereprehensible Robin Hood seemed to have been his curtain call. Surprisingly, though, he proves as durable as Edmund Dantes,emerging from his own private prison to produce a film whichtakes up all the themes he so tediously misdirected those manyyears ago.  Here we have character actors, character-driven story in the midstof all plot entanglements, and Guy Pearce as a villain with tellinglybad teeth.  James Caviezel hits just the right nuances as a mansuddenly abducted from the very moment of his success, andimprisoned in a remote fortress where the only way to tell the timeis by how many lashings you've had.  Richard Harris is hiswonderful hermity best as the fellow prisoner who gives Dantesback at least *some* of his faith, and once he's out, it doesn't takehim long to re-invent himself as the Count (the fast cuts here areperhaps the film's only flaws).His return is marvelously managed, complete with balloons andfireworks, and revenge is sweet -- up to a point.  His great lostlove, admirably portrayed by the relative newcomer DagmaraDominczyk, reminds him of himself before it is too late ... to sayany more would be to make this review a spoiler.Other highlights include a delightful cameo by Freddie Jones,whom many will remember at the Elephant Man's callous keeperin David Lynch's film.To be faithful, sometimes, one must be untrue -- never moreevident than in this film, which beautifully transmutes narrativedelight into narrative delight, still available a century and a half afterDumas's own pots boiled it.",The Count of Monte Cristo

The Count of Monte Cristo is a well written, well acted and well directed. It's a moving story of a man that had to live a life of suffering because of pure hatred and jealousy. You can't not sympathies for the lead character and continue to watch the movie at the same time. Guy Pearce was the perfect villain, while James Caviezel gave the part of his life as the hurtful Edmond Dantes and the vengeful Count of Monte Cristo. But without no doubt, the most hart-capturing character is the priest played by the magnificent Richard Harris (r.i.p). This movie is full of life, energy and amazing characters and adventures.

156,MITCH!,Miscast and misdirected,2,4 November 2002,"Revenge and rebirth are great themes to work with, and doubtlessly helped make ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" a classic in written form. But the film version is a little trickier, in that the audience must empathize with Edmond in order to feel good about themselves while rooting him on throughout his mission of vengeance.Unfortunately, Jim Caviezel is so doe-eyed innocent in the first act that he makes Edmond seem almost pitiful, the kind of luckless and witless character the audience roots against because we can't justify rooting for someone so thin and one-dimensional, not to mention clueless. And Guy Pearce as the villainous Fernand is actually just a caricature of pouts and and schemes, unworthy of formidable antagonist status and easily outwitted, though even poor Edmond has a hard time of it in the end despite his acquired knowledge and worldliness.It's frustrating enough to cast a classic French novel with British and Australian actors, but to completely botch the two lead roles so completely as to destroy any credibility of character is a death blow for what could have been a modern classic, given the stylish cinematography and attention to detail in the art direction. It may be beautiful, but it certainly isn't remarkable.",The Count of Monte Cristo

There is blood, however, and sex, but I didn't spend much of my time (as I too often do in movies) thinking, ""How did they get the actors to consent to do THAT on screen?"" or wondering what kind of manufacturer specializes in internal organs and how their shop floor looks. I will say, however, that as I drove away from this movie, the thing I remembered most is the bone structure of the actors, which deserves an Academy Award all its own.The hot-air balloon entrance was a lovely set piece, one of the best I've seen.  James Caveziel and Guy Pearce both handled the task of showing the effects of age and development of character excellently.  Dagmara Dominczyk, however, suffered the fate of too many female characters in Hollywood, which was being apparently the same exact (rather ineffectual) person in her mid-thirties as she was in her late teens, after a life of loss, motherhood, and systematic betrayal by her husband.

One with an interesting story, well developed characters and a lot of thrills. The ""Count"" starts out in the film as a poor, uneducated worker in love, star crossed and innocent, and finds himself the envy of a friend and on his way to some misfortune and being betrayed by his ""friend""..he lands in a barbaric, horrific prison and luckily meets a jailmate who loves God and who's willing to teach him all he knows.(perhaps that's why Mr. Caviezel chose the role, his being a devout catholic, and the movie's underlying religious message of faith in God, that ""with God, all things are possible"" and the importance of forgiveness, for to hold on to it erodes the self, not so evident with the unfaithful friend, but more so with the love of his life) An interesting point to ponder.Here's where Edmund Dantes finds his will, through the faith and teachings of Richard Harris' character Abbé Faria, who becomes his way out...literally and figuratively. (this part is where it becomes a bit unbelievable, but who cares, it's a swashbuckler, we can forgive a little) And so begins the birth of ""The Count of Monte Cristo""After his escape from hell, he finds fortune through slight misfortune, and befriends a real friend as we will find out, Luis Guzmán, who becomes his valet, an actor who we see mostly in supporting roles who is perhaps rather unappreciated?? With his return to society as a man who found fortune (or should I say was given fortune) he creates an identity unknown to all as the ""Count of Monte Cristo"" and a persona is born. But he has motives, revenge to exact on the former friend who betrayed him and who also happened to steal and marry his woman. An elaborate plan is thought out and ensues...and as it unfolds we find ourselves cheering him on...you might say ""an eye for an eye""..There are a few delightful surprises in it, which make it worth watching, not to mention the obvious swashbuckling moments it calls for...and it has a happy ending, so it could be what you might call, in the end, a ""feel good movie""..I don't recall it being a blockbuster, it could've been if it was made after ""The Passion of the Christ"" the movie that put Caviezel on the Hollywood map, in fact, my guess is..it would have been...Caviezel is absolutely wonderful in this movie, he really is so talented.My vote; 8/10*, one even worth owning..see it and enjoy it.

It's fun, exciting, romantic- not just in the obvious meaning but in the adventurous meaning too- and funny. I loved it when I saw it on the cinema in 2002, and have seen it several times since including now (2019) andI still love it. All the main cast are brilliantly acted- but special mention must go to the fabulous Guy Pierce for his exceptional role as Fernand Mondego. He's handsome, nasty, sexy and mean. Just brilliant!

But this one is special - from beginning to end I was enthralled by the plotting, the characters, the sets, the music, the cinematography, film editing, costumes, and story adaptation. It is truly a quality project all the way, and I hope Hollywood takes notice and realizes that you don't need high-priced movie stars to sell a motion picture.  All you need is imagination, attention to detail, a sense of humor, and passion, and the rest will take of itself.  Go see this new version of a very old story remade in classical form with modern-day sensibilities.  I guarantee you, you won't be disappointed.

I left the theatre, not just confused, but hurt. To this day, I still don't know why the writers decided to ruin the ending. The story is most certainly not a happy-ending guy-gets-girl-and-lives-happily-ever-after deal. The point Dumas was trying to get across was the fact that the persuit for revenge destroyed Edmond, and some things in life aren't beautiful and happy, but sad and ugly. It's a beautiful story...and there were so many things changed that I gave the movie a 6/10 simply because it was reasonably well done, and was so different, that it didn't seem like the book.I'd much rather everyone read the book, but if you're looking for an interesting action movie for the evening, rent this.",The Count of Monte Cristo

It's hard to fault the plot, when it's based on a renowned classic like Dumas' The Count Of Monte Cristo, even if it is a simple revenge tale. Unfortunately, none of the acting rises above the page.None of the leading men are quite manly. James Caviezel who plays Edmond Dantes and Guy Pearce, who plays Fernand Mondego both come across a little weak as swashbucklers. Caviezel tends to be a blank slate anyway, but I really liked Pearce in Memento, so I was a little disappointed to see his be such a weak character. You do dislike Fernand Mondego and want to see him meet his demise, but Pearce could have taken it much further and given Caviezel more distance to grow as a character.

167,Juansmith,"An excellent ""trimdown"" of the original",10,28 January 2002,"(warning: Minor spoilers ahead) Being a 4th year French student, I had the opportunity to watch the 8 hour long French version of this movie... Needless to say, there were quite a few plot elements in the original which could not be included in this 2 hour Hollywood rendition. To be completely honest, based upon the TV ads I saw, I thought this movie would be a complete butchering of the plot of the original. Upon seeing this film, I was quite impressed with how well the plot had been condensed. The prison tunneling breakout scenes, which have previously been portrayed in an arduous and somewhat *cough* boring manner in previous renditions, were very well done. (such as the part when the mans head came up through the floor of his cell) Richard Harris seems to be doing quite well now in the ""bearded old man"" parts. He couldn't have been better casted for the part of Dumbeldorf (Sorry Harry Potter fans... I'm sure I butchered the spelling), and he did quite well as Dantes' mentor in this film. Guy Pearce played well in a fairly typical 'bad guy' role. It was curious how the ending was altered to be less anti-climactic than the original. I won't get into specifics here, but the added 'happy ending' seemed to go well with the pace of the story. Probably my only complaint was the poor casting of relative newcomer to the big screen Dagmara Dominczyk as Mercedes. Her placement in this film seemed to give the otherwise serious role a ""stand around and look pretty"" motif that doesn't really belong in a literary-based film.

I just found out that Henry Cavill was in the cast at 17.I rated a 7. Why not a 10, or an 8.5? The opening and the imprisonment needs to get over with faster. Richard Harris's part drags and drags, and forces the revenge part to be cut short. What a waste! That's why I call it ""unbalanced."" The ratings of 6 to 8 seem about right to me. I'd rate the post-Harris part as a 9. I skip all the way past the Harris part to start the movie at the point of escape.I'd like a new cut that lengthens the revenge and shortens the openings. As for the bad ratings on IMDb, this is a movie and movie business, not a book. Few movies should ever be compared with the book. The bad ratings seem all from disappointment book vs. movie.

170,icgsinc,Terrific portrayal of alcoholic betrayal and false accusation,10,29 August 2004,"This movie has magnificent performances by Guy Pierce as Fernand Mandego and Jim Caviezel (Christ in 'The Passion of the Christ') playing Edmund Dantes, who later becomes the Count of Monte Cristo.The story is billed as one of revenge. Yet the more important aspect is alcoholic egomania, taking form in betrayal and false accusations, embedded in a great movie. And it's timely: it fits right in with the Kobe Bryant trial. We cannot know the veracity of an alcoholic accuser, as appears to be the case in the Kobe trial as well as in Mandego.(I make additional comments about the relationship between the accuser in the Kobe trial and Mandego in an on-line newsletter; readers are welcome to write to me about this.)As with Al Pacino's portrayal of Lt. Col. Frank Slade in 'Scent of a Woman,' most viewers didn't pay attention to or remember the alcoholism. Now it will seem obvious. From the beginning, when he says 'don't expect me to do this sober,' to an attempt to steal his best friend's girlfriend, to the Count's party, Mandego is seen drinking or bringing the bottle in ways suggestive of the idea that alcohol is a very important part of his life. While Mandego is portrayed as obviously inebriated only once, real-life alcoholic Henri Paul, Princess Diana's driver, didn't look drunk in the hotel video immediately prior to the tragedy, despite a blood alcohol level reported at .18 per cent (the equivalent of 12 shots of 80-proof liquor in 4 hours for a 200-pound person). Yet bodyguard Trevor-Rees Jones, who survived the crash, didn't even know Paul had been drinking. Early- to middle-stage alcoholics generally have extraordinarily high tolerance. This includes Mandego.Behavioral symptoms of alcoholism include Dantes telling Mandego, 'Being your friend is always an adventure,' as they drink what appears to be wine (Dantes drinking non-alcoholically). Taking inordinate risks in an effort to inflate the alcoholic ego can lead to great adventure. When Mandego tries to steal away Dantes' long-time girlfriend, Mercedes, she reminds him of previous episodes and comments made by Mandego that appeared to have been rooted in envy. The alcoholic must always win, regardless of cost, which can include behaviors that make it appear as though he covets the loves and lives of others. Near the end of the story, Mandego admits to serial adultery, common in the lives of alcoholics. His compulsive gambling, for which there is a 50% probability of alcoholism, becomes obviously destructive. Falsely accusing his wife of being a whore, he leaves home with bottle in hand. While 'The Count of Monte Cristo' appears to portray an extreme version of alcoholic behavior, recovering alcoholics with ten or more years' sobriety admit to having been capable of 'anything' while using.After 'Scent of a Woman,' this may be the greatest portrayal of alcoholism ever in a movie, providing a terrific example of the profoundly destructive effects of the disease, which can reverberate for decades. And, it combines adventure with a magnificent love story. Terrific movie.",The Count of Monte Cristo

I can imagine they got a lot of criticism for changing the original storyline of Alexandre Dumas père, however I want to applaud them for their courage. For that reason, I give it a 9.

It's fair to say that the book created many things we think of as cliches in story nowadays, but the monte-cristo by numbers direction was a joke.The cinematography backward and arkward. Shots were frequently out of focus (it wasn't the projector, you could see the focal point was on nothing in particular), and in no artistic way. camera motion was awkward and often early or late. No compensation had been made for differing light conditions between shots. If this was my baby I'd seriously consider wrapping it in a blanket and dumping it in a river.The acting of the lead cast was befitting daytime television at best. In fairness, most of the support cast were very good. Particularly Richard Harris and the pirate crew.The story was very rushed and frequently lacked explanation.

178,Sir Ulrich Von Lichtenstein,"A good film, ruined by a disastrous third act.",4,30 January 2002,"Most of the way, this latest adaption of Dumas' classic hits the mark. But in the third act, the filmmakers, in what feels like a studio mandated decision, throw out the story in an idiotic attempt to give ""Monte Cristo"" a happy, feel good ending. This is almost equivalent to changing the ending of ""Hamlet"" so that he doesn't die. The brilliance of the original story lies in the hollowness of it's conclusion: when the story is over, Edmund Dantes figurativel is dead, and it's not his tormentors that killed him, it's his own hate. In this film, Dantes learns that lesson before it's too late, gets the love of his life back, becomes an all around swell guy, and all is right with the world. Terrible, TERRIBLE ending, and a true injustice to a classic.All of this is too bad, because so much of this film works. Jim Caviezel surprised me by really pulling off the deamnds of the character. His transformation from a wide-eyed, uncultured innocent to the save and debonair but hardened COunt is completely believable. He has the prescene to carry the movie, and never feels out of place like the hero of director Kevin Reynolds OTHER classic swashbuckley remake. Caviezel gives us a truly memorable, quality interpretation of a classic character, and it's a shame that Reynolds didn't have the integrity to stick to the story.Guy Pearce, on the other hand, has been far better. His scenery chewing performance isn't really bad, but it's a far cry from his extraoridinary work in ""Memento"". pearce seems to be an actor who needs to be truly challenged by his material.

The plot, not exceptionally intricate and surely comprehensible to a modern audience, is repeatedly ignored in favor of what the scriptwriter and director wish Dumas had written. The innocence of Edmond, a moral goodness that they fear will be interpreted as uncool, is replaced with stupidity. The unexpected betrayal is replaced by circus-freak villains turning in cardboard cutout performances. Guzman, who has the looks for his part as Jacopo, reads his lines as a Brooklyn thug, and thus blows any credibility he could have brought to the role. Richard Harris must have sustained considerable fatigue, as he is quite busy carrying the whole production on his shoulders. Give the guy a break, huh? The writers don't seem to have the slightest nodding acquaintance with the workings of society, human psychology, what made the characters in Dumas' novel effective and memorable, nor how to tell a story. The director seems to suffer the same deficits in understanding how human beings behave, speak, dress, and think.There is some amusement to be derived from the DVD-- the deleted scenes are introduced by the director and film editor, with explanations of why they made the (*wrong*) choice in each case, sacrificing scenes that would have developed the characters, that would have been memorable, or that were simply better film-making than what they eventually put out. It's a hoot. The only choice that didn't diminish the final product is a deleted scene between Danglar and Mondego, both of whom were such laborious caricatures that it simply didn't matter what they did on screen.The clumsy editing of the final battle scene has also spawned a tagline at our house, usable in sudden moments of crisis: ""Hey, look! A rainbow!""The only good thing I can say about this film is that it has increased my love for Dumas, and inspired me to seek out an unabridged version of this novel to read at my leisure-- it's a real occasion for enjoyment, as well as a catalog of all the opportunities the writer and director missed in their rush to release this turkey.",The Count of Monte Cristo

I'm a sucker for a movie that has a protagonist plan everything perfectly, kind of like Mission Impossible where the bad guys never realize that the good guy is two steps ahead - The Count of Monte Cristo's Dantes planned everything to near perfection.  I had no complaints about the acting (Guy Pearce was wonderful - I hated him more and more as the film progressed - a sign of a good villianous actor) nor did I find the pace too slow (although slow at times, my attention was never lost). It just felt that something was still missing.It has been a week since I saw the screening and I think my appreciation of the film is starting to grow.

A second can be made on his account and life as a pirate and finally discovering and uncovering the beautiful treasure. A book of this magnitude requires excessive character building and insight to the mind of the amazing fictional character of Edmond which I have immediately become fascinated with. He has the depth and brilliance of a character like Lestat the vampire. Finally, a third movie can easily be made as the man becomes rich and finally seeks his vengeful motives. That would be a very satisfying conclusion that many people would be excited to watch im sure.Conclusion, an exciting Hollywood movie, serves its purpose. but does not capture the essence of the book to 100%",The Count of Monte Cristo

It's a movie you can take your son to see.If you go to the movies to have fun, this movie will entertain you. Just like the old Saturday afternoon swashbucklers of the past. I throughly enjoyed it.

I pass most of them having been disappointed so many times, but since this story has always been one of my favorites, I had to go and see it. The realization of this old story is very well balanced, doesn't drag, and the characters seem very real indeed. Great production work, directing and acting. An enjoyable experience.",The Count of Monte Cristo
186,FigNewton,Better the second time around!,10,9 February 2002,"I cannot say how badly I was waiting for this movie to hit theatres after I saw the trailer months ago.  This was on my top ""To See"" movies of 2002 and I just have one word to describe it:  WONDERFUL!!I am not one who gets too excited about movies because the finished product is more disappointing than the actual trailer as was the case with ""Planet of The Apes"", and I was really hoping ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" wouldn't follow that dreadful pattern.  It didn't.This movies kept me wide-eyed and on the edge of my seat throughout.  The story was wonderful, the actors were great, the scenery was marvelous and the costumes were breathtaking.  I liked everything about this movie. 
The character development of Edmond Dantes was masterfully done.  We see him in the beginning as an innocent, good-hearted, good-natured and trusting, God-fearing man who is betrayed by his closest friend and the transformation he undergoes makes your heart ache for him...he is now full of bitter hatred and vengeance and his outlook on life revolves on this thirst to quench his revenge.  Jim Cavaziel portrays Edmond perfectly, as does Guy Pearce as his best friend Mondego...though I wished his character had had more screen time...he is a villain you despise from the very outset.  Dagmara Dominczykz is not only naturally beautiful but an excellent actress.  I enjoyed Luis Guzman as Jacopo and Richard Harris portrayed an endearing, colorful character as Abbe Faria.It is good to see Hollywood take the time to actually develop the main character in a movie that speaks of such a deep subject as revenge.  I was personally delighted to see the director not rush through this pivotal period in Edmond's life but gave us something to chew on...the misery, the time it took for Edmond to gain a knowledge that could be useful in the outside world, the realism of years having taken their toll on his psyche, the brutality he experienced all those years.  His relationship with the priest gave us a glimmer of hope that Dantes wouldn't allow his hatred to destroy him.In an age where vulgarity and extreme violence are becoming the stuff audiences are being fed, it is so refreshing to have a story that's well told, well acted and overall a story that doesn't need all the hype and blood and sex to make it WONDERFUL!  I liked this movie so much I just got back from seeing it again and it's better the second time around!  I can't wait to own it on DVD!  Kudos to the makers of this movie.  You've made many people happy by putting out a product that not only works but leaves us feeling good in the end!10 out of 10 :)",The Count of Monte Cristo

It appears Kevin Reynolds has went back to film school and has literally taken every cliche listed in the textbook to heart.  From a half-shadowed face representing the two sides of internal conflict to the wind-blown candle signaling approaching danger to giving all of those with questionable moral fiber very bad teeth.  Oh dear!  Is that foreshadowing?  He's reading The Prince by Machiavelli...what could he possibly be planning?  Reynolds has followed to the letter the recipe for a cookie-cutter piece of tripe.  Take 1 semi-hunky lead, 1 hammy villain, 1 pretty woman, 1 wizened sage and 1 clown modeled after Disney comic relief.  Place in a medium sized European country and shake until all art has been drained.  Serve luke warm.  Honestly, I would have rather sat through an animated musical rendition of this story with a Hispanic monkey in Luis Guzman's place (voiced by that crazy John Leguizamo...yee...um...haw) and perhaps a Jeremy Irons powered villain.

Hallmark Hall of Fame production starring Richard Chamberlain, so I was prepared to be disappointed by this remake. But it started off well, and through the halfway point I was still into it. Then the story deviated sharply from the book, the Count was merely killing off those who'd done him wrong... not the suave, clever Agent of Karma of the novel or the Hallmark version who set wheels in motion to let the wrongdoers create their own downfall. The only reason I didn't eject this tape thinking it a waste of time was Luis Guzman's performance... how about a new Oscar category for Best Bit Player Who Steals Every Scene?

190,fermainclancharlie,Generic adaptation,1,4 January 2020,"''... legislators and leaders of men, such as Lycurgus, Solon, Mahomet, Napoleon, and so on, were all without exception criminals, from the very fact that, making a new law, they transgressed the ancient one, handed down from their ancestors and held sacred by the people, and they did not stop short at bloodshed either, if that bloodshed--often of innocent persons fighting bravely in defence of ancient law--were of use to their cause.'' - Crime and Punishiment by Dostoevsky
The count of the movie does not have the sinister charm of the book count who was a cruel person who thought he was above the law and who was in the right to break the rules to punish those who in the past harmed him, without initially thinking of the innocents who would be. affected. The movie has a generic character.
The romance between Edmond and Mercedes is forced.
""Frailty, Thy Name is Woman"" - Hamlet by Shakespeare
Like Hamlet with Ophelia, Edmond had Mercedes' heartache at marrying Mondego. He didn't ask for it, he still had affection, but there was hurt in his heart.
Turning Albert into Edmond's son is not enough for Edmond to stay with Mercedes. Author of novel, Alexandre Dumas had several children with other women and was not enough to marry one of them.
As for the age difference between Edmond and Haydee, this was never a problem for Alexandre Dumas. He had a daughter with Emélie Cordier. who was 38 years younger than him. No problem in the age difference, because Dumas had younger lovers than him.
Haydee was a slave, referring to the origins of Alexandre Dumas, he was the grandson of a slave. It was his preference for a girl who had the same origins as him.",The Count of Monte Cristo
191,teri_2,"Great adaption, considering it had to fit into 2 hours",9,4 October 2002,"Okay, I've not read the whole book, just parts of it. And, I can sympathize with those who feel cheated that a lot of the book didn't make it into the film. BUT, if they had put everything in--even just half of what they cut out--the movie would have been over 10 hours long! Most films--not all, but most--that are based on books are NEVER as good as the written version. There's no way to get all the subtle nuances in there, to fully explore all the characters...and ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" is **loaded** to the brim with great characters. They--the writers, and director--did the best they could to fit the main theme of the story into a realistic movie length. People just aren't gonna sit through a 3-plus hour film, no matter how good it is. Actually, this book is best suited for a mini-series. The one character that I wish could have been developed as well as he was in the book, was Gerard de Villefort (the chief prosecutor)...now that is a very deeply complex man. In the book, Villefort is more of the main villan, imo...at least from the parts I've read. There is the story about his conflict with his father, the fact that he was married twice and his first wife died, the matter of his daughter Valentina (a name the writers of the film gave to his wife), and the delicious sub-plot of his 2nd wife trying to poison and kill off so many members of his family..plus an affair and illegitimate son that Villefort tries desperately to conceal. I would have loved to have seen any of these plot-lines, because I adore James Frain, and I know he would have done a glorious job with it all. He was **fantastic** in the limited story they gave Villefort in this film adaption, but I'd have truly loved to see him play the character in all his evil glory, as he was in the book. That said, I thought **all** the actors were fantastic. Caviezle (sp?), and Pearce were wonderful, Harris was great as usual, and Frain did an exceptionally convincing job as Villefort. Just wish we could have seen more of the lovely and talented Helen McCrory, and the wonderful Freddie Jones. Despite the fact that soooo much was cut from the original story, I was very pleased with this film. The actors were **glorious**--all of them! If you want a film that's just like the book, then be prepared to sit at your local theatre for over 15 hours. Please, my literary purist friends, get a GRIP! What do you expect from a 2 hour version of a novel as excruciatingly long as ""The Count of Monte Cristo""?? Maybe y'all should just settle for the mini-series starring the highly over-rated Richard Chamberlin.",The Count of Monte Cristo

What I have to say about that is films are films and books are books. I went to watch this film with a friend who has read the book and all throughout the movie she kept saying it wasn't accurate, but when I asked her how she liked it after it was done, she said she enjoyed it! We watched it during a sneak preview and I can't count how many people I recommended it to.Now, on to reviewing the actual movie....Guy Pearce has been one of my favourite actors since Memento and this just added another dimension to his abilities as an actor..the same goes for Jum Caviziel...Frequency was an incredible movie....The story was good and the film work was amazing, they made the few action scenes seem so intense...Great settings and costumes...all in all, a great movie!",The Count of Monte Cristo

194,Timbuktu5,Edmund Dantes is guilty!,4,3 December 2007,"Author Alexander Dumas must be rolling in his grave after learning of how Hollywood could so drastically distort his classic novel.The fundamental premise of the novel is that our hero, Edmund Dantes (i.e. the Count of Monte Cristo), is unaware that he has delivered a treasonous letter from the incarcerated Napoleon Bonaparte and, therefore is unjustly imprisoned. However, this movie  incredibly - rewrites the story to where we find Edmund actually meeting Napoleon and, in effect, collaborating in his plans for a coup d'etat. Therefore, what other conclusion can the viewer take than that Edmund Dantes is guilty of treason and, therefore, deserving of his prison sentence! If that is not enough, the moral premise of this popular novel is that the perpetrator of revenge, no matter how justified in his cause, pays, in the end, a heavy price. In the movie, however, Edmund is rewarded for his one-man vigilante by the happiest of finales.For a more than credible Hollywood version of this classic story, try the 1975 Richard Chamberlain feature.",The Count of Monte Cristo

I'm not an action movie fanatic, but this movie surprised me. Never before had a movie kept me on my toes so much, waiting to see how it would turn out. His revenge surprised me, I mean I figured he would just go out, buy a gun, and kill all of the people that wronged him. That certainly didn't happen.There are people in this movie that stand out more than others. Richard Harris gave an excellent performance, even though his role was not as large as others. Guy Pearce played an excellent vilian, though at times he did seem a bit over the top. His character was evil, so I guess that is the way he was supposed to act. Jim Caviezel is the real star in this movie. He seemed to own the part as if it was made for him.This movie is for anyone who likes action, adventure, or just plain revenge.

197,unscathedicarus,Another weak Dumas adaptation,3,16 January 2002,"During the course of this truly mediocre rendition of The Count of Monte Cristo, my favorite book of all time, I kept wondering where the fault lay.
Was it in the incredibly flawed script that took major liberties with the work for no apparent reason, condensing key plot events to meaningless sound bytes and drawing paper-thin characters that lacked any real relationship with the title character, including the spiteful archvillian rivals and the long-lost love interest? Probably.Perhaps it was the atrocious cinematography, which although darkly stylized tended to obscure the images rather than enhance them.
Terrible editing which actually staggered away from some of the films' beautiful shots definitely helped to shorten my attention span.Thoroughly mediocre performances, at least with the case of Luis Guzman due to poor and ill-suited casting choices, further ruined the beautiful story.All in all, I would say that this medley of flat and trivial filmmaking backed by its impressive budget and loud advertising will prevent any chance of a good adaptation of The Count of Monte Cristo from surfacing for quite some time.",The Count of Monte Cristo

It is a great movie one that starts fast and keeps its suprising pace of action and intelligence throughout the whole movie. It starts out with Edmond Dantès (James Caviezel) and his friend Fernand Mondego (Guy Pearce) in a fight scene, making a person think that this will be a good buddy flick, but things turn so richly around. Dantes is asked to carry a letter by Napoleon Bonaparte during his stay with him. It turns out that it was a letter of treason and Mondego and the first mate of the ship Dantes was made Captain of become jealous and accuse him of treason. Dantes is thrown in a prison, where he is tortured for many years , his fiance marries his friend, and Dantes meets a new friend Abbé Faria (Richard Harris).

202,spire65,Not Monte Cristo,5,8 August 2007,"Upon re-watching this film, I had to lower my rating of it. The acting lies somewhere between tolerable and OK. Guy Pierce did an infinitely better job acting in Memento. As with any adaptation of a book, there will be things left out; however, the degree to which this movie butchered this fantastic novel is inconceivable. Firstly, the movie is lopsided with the early portions of the book receiving remarkably more screen time than the later parts. Some of the characters names might be the same, but most of the movie deviates far from where the actual story went. What is left is a story lacking the same insights, intrigue, characters, and character development. Without giving direct examples, there are moments when the conclusions simply don't add up if you really think about them. This movie was designed to be an action/romance flick without any complexity. He might swing a sword, but he's not the Count of Monte Cristo. This is just some movie with the same name as the book and other more accurate renditions.The French miniseries (6+ hr long) is a much better film (with slightly better acting), but even that takes liberties with the story.

203,ambrosewriter,Unforgivably Untrue,5,3 January 2009,"I would like to seek out my own vendetta against whoever formulated this script. First of all, it seems jerky and is mainly brought forward by Dante's revenge. This movie makes it seem that Dante completed his revenge, but in the book he abandoned his quest of vengeance! The book was a spear against the basic human instinct to seek revenge; it did not glorify it. This led me to question why the filmmakers turned such a fantastic message into a glorified romantic tragedy. The answer: filmmakers dumb things down. Movies are a place for escapism, but sometimes a movie that makes you think can make you lose yourself in your fantasies just as easily a dumb, silly movie. This movie, which by all means could have been excellent, fell into this ever expanding realm of meaningless summer shockers. A classic story was glossed over so they could glorify opulence (i.e. Dante's hot air balloon). It was a big disappointment. Worth a rental if your girlfriend wants you to.",The Count of Monte Cristo
204,Margaux1,The sexiest movie ever - who couldn't love this one?,10,11 June 2003,"I watched this movie against my will.  Movies set in 1806 are not usually my style.  My father rented it and told me he thought I'd like it.  I loved it! It is now my favorite movie of all time...thanks in large part to the talented Guy Pearce (who I never knew existed before the movie). Even as the snarling villain, he got my attention and kept it, but I didn't realize it until the end of the movie.  I saw something in him even before I jumped on the bandwagon and I couldn't take my eyes off him.Whoever doesn't like this movie (or compares it to the ""original"" needs to open their eyes).  A movie is seldom like the book.  The movie is everything it should be:  it has action, adventure, betrayal, reconciliation, humor, and some beautiful men).In won't get into the story...there's enough reviews on this site that do that.  The movie discusses the human will to live and the revenge we humans can't help but obsess about...wouldn't you if someone stole 16 years of your life?Many of the descriptions of this story are inaccurate, unfortunately. Mercedes son is a 'great kid', not following in Mondego's footsteps.  Nor did Mercedes come from a rich family.  Mondego's quote was 'Funny - I don't recall hearing your complaints when I elevated you from being a fish-monger's daughter'  Reviews need to be a tad more accurate, in my opinion.  My husband watched it and even he admitted it was a good one even though it wouldn't be something he or I would typically watch.
Many of us wouldn't survive 16 years in solitary confinement...give Jim Caviezel some credit! :) He deserves the millions he acquires.  It's so stylish and I love when he arrives in the hot air balloon...too sexy and stylish. His clothes are amazing and Guy Pearce looks terrific in those tight pants and ruffly shirts.I do admit that he (Jim Caviezel) looked better than the rest of the cast after 15 years...Mondego has yellow teeth and disgusting fingernails although he's lived the life of Riley but he's still gorgeous...and Monte Cristo looks like a million bucks.The movie is amazing...open your eyes and you might see that too.  This is not the original...the sooner you accept that the more you'll enjoy it.
The rest of the characters are fantastic.  They're good people who are great friends...what could be wrong with that?I give this move a 10 (I'm not Ebert and Roeper) but who cares?  It's amazing and the video store has had to pry it out of my hands.
My only suggestion?  If you have a DVD, RENT the movie and turn on the English subtitles.  It's sometimes difficult to understand their French (actually English) accents and it'll help you understand the movie better! But this one is amazing...so much better than some of what we see today, and there's no swearing either, how refreshing is that?

205,mattedesa,Sweet revenge breeds bitter hatred,8,24 May 2004,"To make it simple, this is a story of betrayal and revenge. Caviezel does a wonderful job of portraying the carefree, innocent victim at the beginning and the movie, transitioning (through a long prison stay) to a bitter, revengeful man.The movie holds fairly true to the classic story. The director wisely leaves out special effects and distractions and lets the good acting and gripping story make the movie a joy.It's also nice to see such a film that doesn't have to pack the film with coarse language and graphic violence. There are some fights, but they are done in a very classy manner, neglecting any gratuitous gore.It's not a quickly moving movie, so sit down and decide to get involved in it, but it is well worth your time.8 of 10",The Count of Monte Cristo
206,tomigarciap,"If you've read the book, do not watch this film",2,3 July 2013,"The count of Monte Cristo by Dumas is with no doubt amongst the best books I've ever read. Edmond's tale teaches us so much, in such a beautiful way. It shows us the passion and the righteous that we all should aspire to.It's true that you should never expect an adaptation to be the complete illustration of what the book delivers. But in this case there is too much distance between the two. I've been reading the reviews and most of the positive reviews come from people that have not read the book. I was very anxious to watch this movie after I finished reading it. But it turned out to be a complete disappointment. The plot has more differences than similarities. There are some alterations to the original narrative that are just pointless and doesn't have anything to do with the book. The movie attempts to portray the most powerful and well written literary vengeance of all times, with a Hollywood cliché vengeance, delivering a drastically changed ending.The movie also fails to provide one of the most appealing aspects of the book. The image of this mysterious, relentless and almost inhuman ""Count of Monte Cristo"" given by the book is not illustrated in the movie. Not even close! If you've read the book and you are as disappointed as I am, watch the 1934 version, it is a better adaptation by far!

208,Eve6Kewl,Splendid Story of Revenge despite deviating from the book,10,15 February 2005,"The Count of Monte Cristo is a splendid film that captures its audience and maintains its interest throughout the film. The entire cast was fantastic, but the film also focused on the plot. Far too many movies these days focus too much on special effects with weak plots.There are Spoilers here, so I suggest watching the film before reading further.The Count presents a solid plot, and it's a complex plot at that. Many films have a single plot that builds up, climaxes and is then resolved. Not in the Count. The Count has a central plot, sure, and that is Edmond Dantès' quest for vengeance against those who wronged him. But the Count also presents us with several sub-plots.At first glance, it seems that Edmond was imprisoned for treason by his first mate, Danglars, betraying him. Although Villefort cleared Edmond of all the charges, he has him rearrested after Edmond mentions the name Clarion. His best friend, Fernand Mondego, hasn't even been brought in to this conspiracy yet. It is not until a few minutes later that we find out that Fernand was in on the conspiracy with Danglars. Later, while Edmond is serving his sentence in the Château d'If, he and his friend/mentor Abbé Faria reconstruct the entire conspiracy, and Edmond learns why he was rearrested for mentioning Clarion. Clarion is Villefort's father. Clarion, who is loyal to Napoleon, is an ""inconvenient parent for an ambitious civil servant"", according to Edmond.Throughout the remainder of the film, Edmond (now as the Count of Monte Cristo), continues to reconstruct all the elements of the conspiracy. Although he is focused on avenging himself upon Danglars, Villefort and ultimately Mondego, he chooses to pursue revenge slowly. He pieces together the entire conspiracy and has Danglars and Villefort arrested and imprisoned. He at long last can set his sights on his former best friend, Mondego. His quest to punish Mondego presents him one with one moreand rather pleasantsurprise. Edmond, not Mondego, is the father of Albert Mondego.Now for the cast.Jim Caviezel is awesome as Edmond Dantès/Count of Monte Cristo. He is awesome playing the dual role of the naïve and innocent Dantès as well as the wealthy, vengeful yet refined Count. In spite of the Count seeking vengeance, you never dislike him. Right from the beginning of the film, you know that Edmond has a good heart. You are always rooting for him and want to see him deliver justice to those who wronged him. And deliver justice he does.Guy Pearce, like Caviezel, is wonderful in his part as (Count) Fernand Mondego. Fernand starts out as a likable character but quickly turns into the guy you hate. For betraying Edmond, you want to see his life ripped away from him just like Edmond's was ripped away. Fernand initially reaps the benefits and pleasures of his life after having Edmond imprisoned (i.e. stealing Edmond's fiancée).Richard Harris too put on a stunning performance as the priest, Abbé Faria. Imprisoned in the Château d'If for over 11 years, he befriends Edmond and becomes a father figure for him. While Edmond helps him dig an escape tunnel, the priest teaches Edmond to read and write, educates him in all subjects and teaches him how to sword fight. Harris plays his part extremely well; he cares about Edmond and shows this in his role. Like Edmond, your heart goes out to him.The other parts were cast equally as well. James Frain and Albie Woodington deliver stellar performances as the villains J.F. Villefort and Danglars, respectively. On Edmond's side, Dagmara Domiczyk is fantastic as Mercedès and Luis Guzmán is great as Jacopo (a pirate who becomes Edmond's right-hand man). And who could forget Michael Wincott for his riveting role as the cruel Armand Dorleac, warden of Château d'If? The rest of the cast deserves recognition as well, but I don't have enough space to commend them all.I've seen this film a few times now, and read people's comments before commenting myself. I think that many who have critiqued the film have been too critical.Was the film unfaithful to the book? Yes, to a degree. Most movies are. Some have commented that there was too much Hollywood in the movie. Where? One of this film's strong points is that it doesn't rely on excess theatrics. There are no absurd special effects or poorly done animations. The sword fights were well-done. Hollywood could've embellished them, but they instead chose to keep them simple and realisticand therefore much more enjoyable.Now for ""credibility"" that was brought up in someone's comments. They were concerned about why the characters didn't age. They did age. However, the key characters were most likely in their early 20s and therefore would only be in their mid 30s by the time the movie ended. So I would not have expected them to change significantly. Recall too that Edmond significantly altered his appearance by adding a goatee and changing his hairstyle. In addition, Mondego seemed to add some facial fringe, which aged his character a bit. Mercedès, being very young, did not need to show aging.Lastly, the same person pointed out ""why did no one recognize Edmond?"" To set the record straight, Mercedès recognized himrather quickly too. At first he ""reminded"" her of him, but later that evening, she was convinced that the Count was indeed Edmond Dantès. As for Fernand and Villefort, it's a psychological matter. In their minds, Edmond was safely locked away in the Château d'If. If something deserves the chief prosecutor's attention, it surely would be the murder of the warden and the escape of a convict. That didn't happen. But even Villefort eventually recognized Dantès when Dantès interrogated him in the spa.Should they have recognized him more quickly? Maybe. Not a showstopper. And it doesn't change the fact that I still give this movie 10 out of 10.",The Count of Monte Cristo

A great piece of work, highly recommend this film for anyone that coudl use a little inspiration.",The Count of Monte Cristo
210,dale_durnell,In praise of the classics,9,27 January 2002,"As one who grew up in the late 40's and early 50's, and who thrilled to the old black and white presentations of the Count of Monte Cristo, and the other works of Alexandre Dumas on small screen televisions, I was exceptionally pleased with this latest rendition of this great classic work. And, as one who grew up with a father and grandfather who worked in the movie industry at MGM through the early 1950's, and as a fan of the art of the cinema, I am pleased to see that the classics have a new life for a new generation (or two).The characters are exceptionally well developed. From early on, you have to cheer for Edmund Dantes. However, an early dislike for Ferndand Mondego quickly grows to a genuine loathing. Likewise, you quickly dislike de Villefort and Danglars, but easily feel compassion for young Mercedes. Of course, it's really a no brainer either to know that Jocabo is going to be faithful to the one who shows him mercy.The prison scenes in the Chateau d'If are marvelously played, and of course Richard Harris does an admirable job -- perhaps the offering the best individual performance in the movie. Given his age, Harris' role must have been extremely challenging for him, even given the fact that it was all a studio set -- working in such cramped positions when he and Edmund are digging their way out must have been painful at times.While I found the story to be faithful to the original, and the marvelous manner in which the Count of Monte Cristo is introduced to society is a work of art, I found two areas with which I had a problem.First -- there were some scenes where the actors either failed to enunciate well, or perhaps it was the sound equipment in the theater in which I viewed the film, but I was disappointed with the sound quality at times. Occasionally, it seemed that the actors had too much to say in the short time alloted for them to say the lines and the dialogue was artificially compressed and incoherent. Again, perhaps a better sound system might have improved this situation (I almost wished for closed captioning subtitles).Second -- when Edmund was the setting of the traps to obtain his vengence, I would have to say that the intrigue was glossed over and that part of the story (which is really critical to fully understand the drama) could have/should have been more fully developed. I fear that since the rest of the story was as faithful as it was to the original story that the elements that would have helped develop and explain the Count's schemes were probably left on the cutting room floor -- perhaps to shorten the movie's running time. For whatever reason, I found this to be an unfortunate situation.Nevertheless, overall this is a quality movie, of a timeless story. To the actors, director, and producer of this, the latest, remake of a wonderful work by a brilliant author I say thanks for a wonderful evening of entertainment and escape from the realities of life.",The Count of Monte Cristo
211,juanbuddha,Big fan of the book,6,16 October 2002,"The Count of Monte Cristo is one of my favorite books so I was destined to be let down by the latest adaptation from classic novel to the movie screen. Although I found it fairly accurate to the most essential details of the book, I found it lifeless and lacking the energy present in the novel.  I never found myself feeling the intense hatred that Edmond has for those who betrayed him.  While not a terrible adaptation, it's a shame it wasn't done better.

It has a lot of action but without the gore of Two Towers.  The dialogue is very good for an action / adventure movie, and was certainly better than that in Minority Report.  The characters are played very well and are very realistic.  Also, the music was fairly good, something that puts it above Spider Man for me.  Last but not least, the romance scenes were very believable, unlike the romance scenes in Star Wars II.  There is nothing exceptional about this movie, but it does everything well with no flaws in the acting, cinematography, visual effects, costume, artwork, etc...  All in all, I was glad to see it in the movie theatre, I gladly rented it on DVD, and will recommend it to anyone.",The Count of Monte Cristo
213,MarlaJJohnson,Easily one of the best films ever!,10,30 June 2012,"Somehow The Count of Monte Cristo has managed to receive a mere 7.6 rating. This boggles my mind, for I believe it is one of the best films ever made! Every time I watch this film, I am reminded why I enjoy it so much. Jim Caviezel does a fantastic job as Edmund Dantes. His growth as a character, from a simple ship mate to a revenge-seeking count, is real and believable. Caviezel isn't the only memorable actor, though. Guy Pearce (Mondego), James Frain (Villefort), Dagmara Dominczyk (Mercedes), Luis Guzman (Jacapo), and even Henry Cavill (Albert), all bring their best performances. There are multiple one-liners that make you want to root for the good guy or kick the bad guy's butt. Either way, it is a thrill to watch as the story unfolds. Even the first half of the film, which some believe is too slow, sets a great precedence for the rest of the film. In my opinion, it reveals the trust Dantes has in his friends and colleagues, even if it is a bit naive. It is just enough to stir the hatred and vengeance in the hearts of the viewers, making Dantes' plot for revenge all the more entertaining to watch. Overall, this film definitely deserves more than a 7.6 rating. It is an easy 10 out of 10 for me!",The Count of Monte Cristo
214,Cheerful_Dragon,Disappointing,4,21 August 2005,"Before I saw this film, I thought it would be good because of the cast - James Caviezel and Guy Pearce are both good actors. The film had barely started before I knew it would be a waste of time. I'm not going to post spoilers, I'll just say that the relationships between a number of characters have been changed way beyond the usual trimming that goes on with film adaptations. Characters have been added or changed for no apparent reason. The book contains numerous sub-plots and it would take a mini-series, like the one starring Gerard Depardieu, to fit them all in. This film doesn't even try. All the subtleties are ripped out of the story, and they even give it a happy ending.If you want to watch a film of The Count of Monte Cristo and don't want to sit through a mini-series, hunt down the Richard Chamberlain version. It's much better.",The Count of Monte Cristo
215,Klausfiend,Not bad; not great.,6,5 February 2002,"It's starting to get on my nerves that screenwriters sacrifice details for the sake of pacing.While this film starts out strong, the ending is rushed, and cliche.The original story is a fascinating tale of revenge; I can't go into detail about what the movie does without revealing plot details, but suffice it to say that Dantes' cold-hearted and carefully exacted revenge as depicted in the book does NOT happen - which is quite disappointing - since the movie's ending is trite, and does not satisfy the desire of the protagonist, or the viewer, for true vengeance - the suffering of those who brought about his initial distress.As is said early on ... ""death is too easy."" Why, then, give in to the easy solution after the arduous task of surviving and being reborn?Granted, telling the second half with the same detail as the first would have resulted in a movie 3+ hours long ... but the new ""spin"" does not do Dumas' masterwork justice.",The Count of Monte Cristo
216,loach10,"Adequate historical romp, but far from a cinematic feast.",5,1 May 2002,"I entered the theatre very much a blank canvas, having never read the Dumas classic,  willing and very much hoping to be impressed. The opening scenes however very much set the tone, slipshod directing which generated little tension or drama, and somewhat hapless acting from Caviezel and Pearce alike.  Indeed, Caviezel had the glare of headlights almost visible in his eyes for the first half of the film. Pearce proved he could hamm it up with the best, and was a more than adequate villain of the piece, but then the role could hardly be described as demanding. Harris' performance was undoubtedly the highlight of the piece, imbued with lashings of dark humour; a brilliantly nuanced piece of acting that truely put his co-stars to shame.The plot moved apace, in parts at an almost nauseating speed, and despite becoming increasingly convoluted just about managed to keep my interest. The climax was however... dull and seemingly inexplicable, if anyone who has read the book can tell me how Albert was able to follow his father, whose destination was unknown to him, and similtaneously leave a note to his mother telling her where he was going so that she could turn up at the duel scene,  I should very much like to know. Perhaps most disappointing was the failure to generate any sense of period, this was very much 19th century France of pantomine drop in scenary even the prison was remarkably clean? Still this was an affable enough piece and far from genuinely dislikable or offensive. **1/2 out of *****",The Count of Monte Cristo
217,kumindac,"Good movie, Disappointing adaptation",6,19 July 2002,"I just returned from the movie theatre and I have mixed feeling about the movie, I have to admit that I never managed to enjoy the movie since I keep on comparing it with the original book and the TV adaptation I've seen before.The Movie is really good. It was well done. Actually it would have been be better, if they introduced the movie as ""Based on the Story count of Monte-Cristo"" Instead of telling ""Alexander Dumas Count of Monte-Cristo"".I read the Comments in IMDB before going to the theatre and I did not expect a perfect adaptation of the story. But I must admit that actually the previous comments on the movie as ""Not faithful"" to the book is bit too soft. The movie has not taken anything out from the book except for the character.The original count of Monte cristo is not just a simple rich man with lots of money to spend on revenge. Behind that character there is a shrewd businessmen, a calculating Politician and an Iron heart.He is more mystical person than the count in the movie. He had mystical portions, Knowledge on all known arts. He has taken lot of such things from Arabia and Africa.The character like the Nubian Slave and the African (or was it Turkish) Princess In the original story has no place in the movie. The Count is not as vulnerable as in the movie. The book gives in great detail the how he goes towards his goals.This movie has nothing of that sort. Actually the movie has wasted so much precious minutes in the prison, which they would have used in the latter part more effectively.One might argue with me it's not possible to bring such a big story (The book may be at least 2KG heavy) to a movie. For them, I would ask to watch the TV adaptation of the same story. It has all the essence of the original book. Though that adaptation take off lots of chunks of the story away, it is not trying to change the original story.BTW, now I am longing for that TV adaptation. It would be nice to see it again after seen this disappointing adaptation.If you have read the book don't go to the movie. It's a total disappointment. If you haven't read the book, then go and watch the movie it's a nice production.

Going into this movie expecting anything unexpected is foolish, even if you don't know the story.That said, this movie was so much fun. The visuals were well-done, the fight scenes great, the humor spaced out and appropriate, and the flow of the movie quite quick...he may have spent 14 years in prison, but it sure doesn't feel like that to us...You get a sense of time passing but it isn't belabored.If you don't mind knowing exactly what will happen and/or you liked The Rock you should enjoy this movie.

The movie, for those who've read the book, will see it follows the plot line pretty close. I was a little dissapointed in the fact that the movie was unable to develope emotional attachments between myself and the hero or any other character in the movie.  There are some memorable quotes in the film, and some chuckle scenes, but other than that it's a good movie to take a date to see, but I wouldn't recommend this as a must-see, rather than a good matinee movie if you have nothing better to do.

But they've gutted the numerous revenge plots and corrupted one of the books prime themes:(Spoiler alert) The book explicitly tells us that Edmond believes God saved him from prison so that he could exact his revenge upon the people who falsely imprisoned him. Edmond was a God-fearing man who loved his father and the dignity of being an honorable man. There is NO way he would have slept with Mercedes before marriage - not even the night before. So right from the start, the movie is on the wrong foot.Albert is not Edmond's son in the book and Edmond does not live happily ever after with Mercedes. In fact, one of my favorite characters (Haydee) is left out of this movie entirely. She is his redemption and his new reason for living after his revenge is completed.The movie isn't bad, it just isn't the same storyline.

Great performances, exciting story, and a fun wit, this film has everything that was terrific in Dumas' original novel and then twists it all up to adapt perfectly to the screen but doesn't stray to far.But is perfectly to strong a word?  Of course not.  Monte Cristo boasts the talent of both Guy Pearce and Jim Caviezal as former friends who have turned against each other in the epic-set Napoleanic French era.  As Caviezal grows more throughout the film, Pearce becomes more and more a monster basking in his own greed.The late Richard Harris is very bold in one of his final performances and Luis Guzman is perfect as Monte Cristos right-hand man.See this film and reccomend it.

Great locations, the acting wasn't too bad, ...

231,Rascar-Capac,Masterful: Where love meets revenge,9,23 September 2008,"Do we really need yet another film version of Dumas classic novel of romance, betrayal and revenge? Well, despite the huge number of Monte Cristo movies, there are surprisingly few, that can be called classics (most famous perhaps the 1934 version, featuring Robert Donat) and yes, this one really deserves to be discovered as a hidden classic. I said ""discovered"", because the film wasn't a box office hit and to me it seems, that it's qualities have been overlooked by most critics. Director Kevin Reynolds gets everything right with this one, recapturing a post Napoleonic France with colorful costumes and settings. But most of all his ""Monte Cristo"" is rooted so much nearer to Hollywood's Golden Age of costume adventure than to several recent plundering of Dumas like ""The Musketeer"" (2001). Script writer Jay Wolpert delivered a shortened and streamlined version of Dumas original tale. Some purists found, that the result should be called loosely based on Dumas Count of Monte Cristo"". However, with all it's reshaping of the famous literary revenge story, Dumas central message remains untouched: Betrayed and imprisoned, our honest (and in the beginning slightly naive) hero suffers endlessly (in a brief scene he is on the edge of committing suicide). He finally escapes, becomes the heir of an enormous treasure and makes his second entry into life as an elegant, cold-blooded avenger. The script alters the revenge plot and Dumas figure constellation, but it does so with a more than satisfying result, putting the tragic love story between Edmond and Mercedes into the center of this drama. But how do you capture a novel, that runs a thousand pages within a film time of only 130 minutes? Director Reynolds succeeds surprisingly well. The film always moves at the right pace. It takes it's time to introduce the viewer to the main characters and shows us why the bad guys turn to conspiracy. On the other hand, where Dumas narration seems overhanging, the film speeds up effortlessly. For instance, Dantes rise as the Count of Monte Cristo and his introduction to the upper society of Paris are shown like a musical interlude, in an elegant montage of scenes. The producers wisely opted for a cast without superstars. James Claviezel is the upright sailor, thrown into martyrdom and Guy Pearce his ruthless opponent Fernand Mondego, who simulates friendship but begrudges his companions fortune. Young polish actress Dagmara Dominczyk is equally believable as Dantes teenage fiancée Mercedes and as the matured woman, who desperately fights for her lost love. The scenes between her and Claviezel are intense and touching, beautifully photographed and further enhanced by Edward Shearmure's fine music score. 9 out of 10, with one point omitted for the final sabre duel, which, though carefully staged, did not live up to my expectations. Also, the film has been overworked here with some unnecessary photographic effect.",The Count of Monte Cristo

237,jalenn,And the fun just keeps on coming,8,26 January 2002,"I went to this movie to show a little support for Jim Caviezel (loved him in Frequency and damnit, I want the guy to keep making movies) and I stayed for much more.  It's not the greatest period piece you'll ever see (I doubt the phrase `You don't get out much, do ya?' was in wide circulation in 1814) but if the occasional bit of nuevo dialogue pains you, take heart: there is some incredible scenery and some pretty impressive swordplay. Walking in, you know it's a tale of vengeance (thank you, oh mighty to the point tagline poster makers) and though CoMC follows the basic progression of most revenge movies -  there are few times when you aren't too absorbed in the story to notice.  Edmund Dantes, the protagonist is played the talented Jim Caviezel, who seems to have come out of that coma he suffered in Angel Eyes with no ill effects. Caviezel's Edmund is a man who undergoes a slow and deliberate transformation from simple yet principled and charming innocent to a faithless man robbed of everything and returning for nothing less than revenge.  It's a marked change and Caviezel plays it so well, you even seem to see the change in his eyes. Guy Pearce is good albeit campy to the max, as the best friend turned betrayer.  If I had any complaint it would be with the development of Guy's Count Mondego (or lack thereof)...he's such a sulky a**hole throughout, you wonder why and how he and Edmund were ever friends in the first place.  Though to be fair, he does a nice job of occasionally letting you glimpse his inner demon: he knows that for all his worldly goods, he will never be half the man Edmund is.  Luis Guzman is great as Edmund's cohort (there's a funny scene in which he offers to take care of all of the recently escaped Edmund's `problems' quickly so they can get on with living like kings with a treasure they find) though you wonder if he just caught a plane out of da Bronx.  He is definitely and, at times, hilariously out of place in this one.  His thick Bronx accent aside, he infuses some quiet honesty and perspective into a couple of key scenes as Edmund's thirst for revenge seems to get out of hand.  Dagmara Dominczyk, as Mercedes the love interest, is lovely but standard, she doesn't do much except serve as another pawn in the chess game between Edmund and Mondego. The movie requires some suspension of disbelief, most of all regarding the fact that no one recognizes Edmund when he returns, despite little change in his outward appearance (he gets a tan and a goatee and they're all completely fooled).  A little more action early on wouldn't have killed either -  the period spent in jail seemed to go on FOREVER (perhaps intentionally) and even the occasional appearance by Michael Wincott as a sadistic warden and Richard Harris as a fellow convict who gives Edmund an education worthy of a gentleman, does but a little to infuse some life into scenes that tended to drag.  Despite these small flaws, Count of Monte Cristo is an engrossing ride of impressive visuals and solid acting.  Furthermore, everything I've said aside, it's worth your money just to see Edmund's wonderfully intricate plan for revenge slowly unfold. I caught a matinee on opening day and if I'd paid evening fare, I wouldn't have been upset in the least.",The Count of Monte Cristo

243,sereonadafate,Terrible,1,10 December 2020,"This version is the worst of all the adaptations in the book.
Screenwriter Jay Wolpert behaved like comprachicos in The man who laughs by Victor Hugo and disfigured the story. There is no excuse for the time limitation, because the 1975 version with Richard Chamberlain and the Argentine version of 1953 with Jorge Mistral had the same problems in relation to time, but remained much more similar to the book than this terrible fanfiction. Without the qualities of grandeur, sophistication of the character and the whole story in a generic adventure without sophistication.
While Viktor Avilov in the film The Prisoner of Château d'If, a Soviet adaptation of Alexandre Dumas' novel played Edmond Dantes in someone closer to Woland in Master and Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov, someone very powerful, great, cynical, relentless, but generous , Jim Cavizell played a count of monte Cristo, without the grandeur, cynicism of the character. He looks more like a clown who keeps jumping like a monkey and screaming like a crazy idiot with no intelligence. A street bully and unsophisticated.
Mercedes had her tragic heroine personality altered to be a more active woman, but she lacks the qualities of Margarita who fights bravely to protect her beloved in Master and Margarita by Bulgakov or has the devotion of Dea in The man Who Laughs by Victor Hugo , to prove someone worthy of Edmond. She is not someone who is worthy of his love. She doesn't have the quality to arouse a new love in Edmond, she is useless to him.
Revenge is the worst, they forgot the brilliance of the count in using the vices of their antagonists to destroy them. Showing how much nothing has changed internally and remain the same scoundrels. They replaced it with generic struggles without greatness.",The Count of Monte Cristo

However, there is a small problem. This movie is based off a terrific book. It is not some original piece that I can forgive for its errors. If they had just followed the book the movie would be ten times better. It is an insult for this movie to carry the same title as Dumas's masterpiece. Even if you have not read the book you will find the end rather dull. This is supposed to be a story of revenge.If you have not read the book read it... or if you are lazy then go see the movie... but they are not comparable.

247,americanscipio,A great adaptation of one of the best novels ever,9,23 February 2002,"The Count of Monte Cristo, like Les Miserables, stands as a great achievement in world literature by a Frenchman.  The truest English translation yet became available in 1996, and the movie echoes its vibrance with a lucid plot and multi-dimensional characters that do the old master (Dumas) proud.Jim Caviezel is the brightest spot in this great production that eschews the more depraved violence of the novel for an aesthetically and morally pleasing vengeance.  Whole plots are left out, and those kept are cut down to their bare bones, but so pleasantly that the movie feels right, even to this jaded reviewer.  Romance is the order of the day in this production; pregnant pauses, knowing servants, and failing marriages help balance the implacable Count in his pursuit of revenge.  Richard Harris as the Abbe Faria brings a welcome touch of anti-gravitas to the role.One unpleasant touch to the whole movie: there is a ludicrous scene of torture that serves to mark time in Dantes's imprisonment at the Chateau D'If.  At the time it is totally extraneous, but once Dantes begins his revenge, the film resolves it nicely.",The Count of Monte Cristo
248,DocRedfield,Excellent - Dramatic and Powerful. Revenge served Cold.,10,15 January 2002,"Seeing an advance Screening of 'The Count of Monte Cristo', and having only seen one advertising TV spot before hand, I really did not know what I was going into this time.  I vaguely recalled it being an Alexander Dumas book, and former film/TV versions featuring rather depressing prison scenes with men tunneling to the freedom of the Sea.  Indeed, despite its wonderful locations and details, once the afore-mentioned prison scenes of this version presented themselves I was set to be depressed again and wondered where the story was going.  And then several wonderful things happened; A whole new group of characters were introduced to our rather whiney protagonist - some good, some very bad.  And by the time said Protagonist had escaped the Prison, he too had become wonderfully evoked and dynamic, and I wanted to see him get everything he wanted and deserved: REVENGE. From then on this film was a barrage of wonderful scripting (the adaption being perfect in its pacing and wit), characters, acting, events, costumes, action, suspense and romance.  The audience laughed with genuine awe as each new moment or detail was revealed to us in the plans of the main character's (played perfectly, from his innocent beginnings to his scheming later years)steps towards that end.  This movie was amazing, with very cool performances from Guy Pearce and the rest of the supporting cast, each figure getting his or her share of good lines.  The tale of vengeance is well-balanced with tales of friendship, questing and plotting, and romance, and all of the implications each relationship holds, be it good or bad.  At times the theater openly applauded twists or returning characters.  It is perfectly timed and written, with powerful moments and style, and I would recommend it to ANYONE.",The Count of Monte Cristo

250,PJCRepair,A Romping Good Time!,7,2 February 2002,"I really enjoyed watching The Count of Monte Christo, don't get me wrong, I didn't love it, or rush out to buy another ticket, nor did I wake up during the credits. I enjoyed watching the movie. It was very entertaining and, while it was quite long, it seemed to  hold my interest throughout.One notable performance was Guy Pearce, he really did a good job as the bad guy. He was likeable in the beginning, yet allowed his faults in character to speak for his unhonorable actions. There is not much worse than a bad guy who just seems to be bad, he has no reason for it, he just takes the bad side of things, and expects the viewer to accept his wrong-doings in order to create the story. Well let me tell you, Guy Pearce played the opposite, he was an pig! And he did a tremendous job showing why he was so evil. (You'll have to see the movie to find out!)Anyways, we come to the point of ""movie vs. the book"". I have never read the classic novel by Mr. Dumas, bu I am sure it is quite good. Overall, I think the movie did a good job of being a movie though. My overall opinion of books versus movies is that books and movies are two different things. A movie should never be scene-by-scene copy of the book. Rather the movie should be well edited enough to represent the book, yet stand on it's own as a movie. For example, Harry Potter and the Sorcer's Stone. It was a great book, I really enjoyed reading it, but the movie withered in it's quality. But not because it didn't follow the story, actually, it followed it to the tee, rather it lacked because it couldn't stand on it's own as a movie, it was more of a ""visual commentary"" on the book. It might be difficult to understand, but my point is that a movie taken from a book should be able to stand as a movie first (with well developed characters, good cinematography, etc.), then follow the book (plot, chronological events, etc.)And overall, this movie did a great job standing on it's own.",The Count of Monte Cristo

As a child I was first exposed to the story by the wonderful serial adaptation of the book on BBC Television. This movie version just doesn't convey the layers of the characters nor the emotion of the book at all. I kept hoping the movie would improve as it went along, but it didn't.

During his years of suffering, he plots revenge against the people who sent him there, and comes to assume a dramatic alias: The Count of Monte Cristo. The acting is superb, with Jim Caviziel strong in the lead role, utterly sympathetic as the man who was wronged. Guy Pearce is dastardly debonair as his best friend the Count Mondego.

This was well done, from the superb acting from Cavieziel as Dantes, Pearce as Mondego, and Guzman as Savior Jacapo. Of Course, Richard Harris always is outstanding. Villefort also was good, as were all the other bit characters. The Lady Mondego was a little weak, at times a little too nasally but not below average. I thought also the young actor playing the son was very believable.

This version in particular should be avoided at all costs. The inaccuracies contained in this TV movie made me shudder. The screenwriters are counting on the vast majority of the viewing public not having read this great adventure, so they take many liberties. Unfortunately, ""Count"" suffers the same fate as ""The Lord of the Rings,"" in which a wealth of material must be boiled down to fit into a given time frame. The result is a story with no heart and soul, a problem which has plagued ""Count"" since the first film version done in 1937 all the way up to and including the stinker we are talking about here.

257,sereonadasartre,This is the worst adaptation of The Count of Monte Cristo,1,21 January 2019,"The five best adaptations
Le Comte de monte-Cristo (1979)
The count of Monte Cristo (1964)
Uznik Zamka If (1988)
El Conde de Montecristo (1941)
Gankutsuou (2005)They turned a bitter, resentful person into an irritated person, losing the depth of Count's character, making him a banal clueless cliche.Eat by the edges. Informing himself of his rottenness, Monte Cristo destroys his enemies by making them face their own evil, avoiding at the most confronting them directly. In life, stuck your finger in the nose of someone speaking what we consider to be the truth, will only bring us more problems and certainly an enemy. It's best to stay in the shadows. They turned the count and a Machiavellian man into a generic punisher of HQ.
From well-crafted revenge using cunning to action and fights idiots.
Omitted that Count's revenge had unexpected effects and affected innocent.
A stupid clichéd romance that forgets that people change, their feelings change, Edmond's feelings for Mercedes have changed and he does not love her anymore, he has affection, but there is no passion. It was an immature end not recognizing that people and your feelings change and we can rather love other people. Edmond and Mercedes were separated for many years and obviously their feelings would change.
Aydee is the ideal person for Count, she has an equal past and understands the suffering and feelings of the Count much better than Mercedes who only has the favor of being Count's first love, but whom he does not find for many years while he was close to Haydee and of course he fell in love with her.
The end taught me that if we lose a person we love, we can find another than to live the illusion of regaining our first love when people change.Most of the adaptations retain the original ending and do not hold Hollywood's immature ending.",The Count of Monte Cristo

259,scurvyfreedman,Reduced to the lowest common denominator,7,3 December 2003,"<i>The Count of Monte Cristo</i> is my favorite book.  I just read the most recent full-translation of the original text.  I understand that it would be impossible to reduce a 1400 page novel to only 100 minutes and keep it identical or even close to the book's detail and intricacies. That is not what is necessary in order to have a successful adaptation. However, the theme must remain constant.  The main character and his motivation must be unyielding.  The result must be the same for the audience.  I was left unsatisfied by Dantes revenge in the movie since the motivations of the antagonists were removed from the story.  Sure Fernand Count de Morcref had his motivation, but his entire story changed. Villefort's motivation was similar to the book but why protect his father in order to do what he does?Even as I doubt the serious treatment of this novel by Hollywood by breaking into at least two distinct portions, each with satisfying endings, I prepare for the third installment of <i>Lord of the Rings.</i> Obviously serious fantasy novels can be brought to the screen without too much deviation and with a true commitment to the fandom.**SPOILERS***A trilogy would be terrific.  The Plot through the Escape.  This would lead to a happy ending in and of itself.  The second could be the Count's finding his fortune and meeting of the two young men at Carnival along with the backstory necessary like finding out about his father's death, meeting Luigi Vampa, Haydee's story, and end with him repaying Morrel by saving his life. Another happy ending.  It's not purely a story of revenge, but repaying those who both helped and hurt you in life.  Part two would end with his introduction into Parisian society.  Finally, part three would be his revenge- cold and detached, but intricately planned.  An embarassment leading to suicide, an attempted infantacide leading to an arrest, a bankruptcy, and a death at the hands of a would be accomplice.  There are more than two who deserve revenge and several who deserve benefit.  All received it in the book, which left this movie to be less than satisfying.",The Count of Monte Cristo

So I was extremely happy to discover that the movie was coming out. It was wonderfully done. My new favorite movie! It had everything a good movie should have +plus some totally rad sword fights!! The 'Count' scenery was absolutely beautiful, the actors (especially Guy Pearce) were perfect for their parts, and a classic tale of revenge......who could ask for more in a movie? Maybe you'll be so lucky as me to get the little kid at the front of the theatre that shouts 'kill him' at every sword fight...who knows.

263,katiemartens-1,A Real Swashbuckler!,8,18 July 2007,"I love this film for its story line; the epic battles between good and evil, the cling clang clash of sword play in days when battle was a face-to-face affair, to excitement of revenge and adrenaline of a good mystery. This is a FANTASTIC TALE!!Unfortunately, I cannot love it COMPLETELY. Don't get me wrong, I will still recommend it to anyone I come across who looks like they might be in need of a movie for the evening :). Nevertheless, the film itself has a few flaws, I felt. My biggest problem is the casting choice for the main character, Jim Caveziel (Jesus in ""the Passion"") as Edmond Dantes/ the Count. Guy Pearce plays a PERFECT nasty best friend, and the girl, boy, and servant are OK. So basically, you have Guy Pearce, and a healthy list of small supporting characters, carrying the film. I still recommend this film; if you like it, read the book, even if you're not a ""reader"", you'll LOVE it!. Also if you like it, here are some other movies I think you may enjoy: ""Tristan and Isolde"" - a fairly recent action/drama that didn't have enough budget for a lot of promoting, but did have enough to pay for gorgeous cinematography, lots of battle weapons and burning sets, and a truly wonderful cast. Also, some of the same producers.""The Princess Bride"" - I'm not sure if I've EVER found someone who did NOT love this movie. Truly deserving of it's ""cult"" status, try it and see why we all love this lighthearted epic romp!""The Three Musketeers"" - With all the killing, conspiring, and womanizing, you'd hardly believe this was a Disney film.

So you read the book...good for you, go the kitchen and get yourself a cookie. This movie is very good. I myself have read the book, and I think this is a great adaptation. No, it's not exactly like the book, but here's a newsflash people: no movie will ever be exactly like the book! Even Lord of the Rings left out a lot of the book, but I still think that was a great movie! There are a lot of things in a book that you can't do in a movie. An author can tell you exactly what somebody is thinking, or exactly how a scene is to the smallest detail. Not only can you read a few chapters, and then put the book away and read some the next day, but there is also time constraints. If you are willing to sit through a 3 to 4 hour film, then I understand some complaints, but a lot of people aren't. The only thing about the movie that made me rate it an 8/10 was that I wish there was more mind games. If there had been more of Edmond playing with peoples minds in his revenge scheme, I think it would have added a lot to the movie. Overall, this is a great flick.

Don't just read The count of monte Cristo, also read Notes from Underground, The brothers Karamazov, demons, Crime and Punishiment by Dostoevsky. You will see the difference in the psychological question of the characters in Jay Wolpert's writing for masters like Dostoevsky and Alexandre Dumas. Jay Wolpert knows absolutely nothing about human nature, he imagines what it would be like, but he doesn't.
The approach to the theme of justice here is very superficial.
For those who think that the film has improved the question of the protagonist's relationship, I advise you to read about Alexander Solzhenitsyn's relationships with his wives.

It's entertaining and not a waste of time or money (though I saw it for free).  I have never read the book but others say that it was pretty faithful to it, so you decide if that's good or bad.  I liked this movie and would recommend it to any adult. There are some incredibly cheesy parts but what do you expect from a Disney-owned distributing company?  Jim Cavaziel is a good Edmund Dantes, Guy Pearce does a good villain and Luis Guzman is funny but anyone who has seen the movie has to agree with me on this: what was up with his hair?  I mean once he becomes Dantes' main man.  By the way Cavaziel is a devout Roman Catholic so he didn't do any of the love scenes with the Polish actress who played Mercedes. I think it's admirable that he is so open about his religion, but that's just me.  Oh, and he's as gorgeous in real life as he is in person!!!!",The Count of Monte Cristo

It will suffice to say the story has been simplified enough. Valid reason would be that The Count of Monte Cristo is a rather long story which would have been impossible to fit in your average length film. That's not the qualm I have with the film. Cast is average, but not bad. I could live with that, too. I'm quite used by now to how Hollywood usually treats stories like this one.The main reason I think this movie is bad enough to get 5/10* is that somehow the main point of it is missed. All the while during the film I was getting the feeling that the story is about love, and not revenge. That it's about how a hero will overcome all obstacles, no matter how big or difficult to be finally reunited with his true love. Revenge was moved somewhere in the background, relegated to secondary goal of Edmond Dantes. Now that is something that I have trouble accepting. I don't mind all those details I already mentioned during ""hollywood-isation"" of books, but I can't stand when they change the point, theme or motif of the book in order to appeal more to teenagers.If you're a fan of the story of The Count of Monte Cristo you probably won't enjoy the film.

It is not possible to condense a 2000+ page book into two hours, but (at least until the ending) they didn't do that bad a job.  It was kinda funny when they said ""it's complicated"" if you've read the book.My major problem with it was that it was too easy.  They made ""mondago"" too clearly evil, mercedes' actions readily justifiable, and Edmund too much of a good guy.  In the book they are just people who have made decisions that they are (at least somewhat) conflicted about.If you liked this movie, but don't want to read the book, I'd recommend the Bravo miniseries with Gerard Depardieu (I think it's out on DVD).

This is a great movie, and greatly underrated.This movie is about revenge in its purest form. Its not ""bang bang, you're dead, lets go to the next person"". Its a good revenge with planning, slowly drawing the victim to the net. The revenge that makes you laugh out loud, the muahaha-laughter, but for the good guy.Its about Edmond Dantés, the young sailor who has it everything. A beautiful fiancée, a great job, a kind father, a ""good"" friend. Well everything, expect for money, but what does money matter when you've got everything else? And then, something goes horribly wrong.Guy Pearce as the bad guy, Oh My God! Only hearing his voice in this movie, makes me wanna break something, and that my friends, is great acting.James Caviezel as Edmond Dantés, is not only the count who is going to revenge the people who made his life miserable, hes also hot, cool and smart.The absolute best performance was Richard Harris as abbé Faria, the teacher. This character may be one of the greatest clichés (at least in fantasy): The old man teaching the young man. Clichés aren't always bad, and Harris proves it a 110%. Nobody could have done his character better.Mercedes was okay, a little bit irritating, but thats more to the actress than the character.I wont forget Jacopo and Luigi Vampa. You could call them the funny sidekicks or whatever, but without them, it wouldn't have been such a great, enjoyable movie.And when you see this movie, because it would only be a loss if you didn't, remember, hes a count, not a saint.",The Count of Monte Cristo

I have to admit that I haven't read the original story any time recently, nor seen any of the other movie versions within the last few years, so I didn't have any expectations about what was supposed to happen in the story, or which characters would live or die.  I just remembered vaguely that this was a story about a guy who's put in prison for decades, and slowly digs a tunnel out, inch by inch over the years.  The movie does indeed have that, and you do get a sense of the rage at false imprisonment, along with the extraordinary patience and frustration that would be required for such a task. Then after that part, a whole new ""Treasure Island"" section of the movie opens, with entertaining characters and swashbuckling swordfights.  This is an adventure yarn that carried me along at a nice pace, and, like ""Three Musketeers"", has sections where it adds the right amount of humor into the mix, so that you know that it's not taking itself too seriously.  I and everyone else in the audience laughed along with the movie in certain parts, and the characters were well-drawn enough to care about.  Plus there was some excellent talent in the cast, ranging from Richard Harris to Guy Pearce of ""Memento"" to James Frain (the Spanish Ambassador from ""Elizabeth"") who I especially enjoyed.On the downside, the movie does feel like it's been heavily edited here and there, arranging and rearranging certain sections.  In parts, it's difficult to follow some of the dialogue as it seems that a chapter or two of the book have been mashed into a quick monologue that covers the high points.  The lines by the Count's sidekick character (Luis Guzman) also feel a bit out of place at times, like they don't fit with the flow of the rest of the movie. And one sword-fighting scene is edited with a dizzying ""Gladiator"" blur, that though entertaining, doesn't seem to quite fit with the rest of the movie either.  But after all is said and done, I left this movie with a sense of, ""Wow, that was a lot of fun!"" and I'm looking forward to seeing it a second time!",The Count of Monte Cristo
275,danimo,Not a success,5,25 January 2002,"If my comments seem jaded, they are.  Dumas' novel The Count of Monte Cristo is one of my desert-island favorite books.  Reynold's film version is not.The best thing about this film is the star, James Caviezel.  His dark, brooding looks and calm actions convey the Count masterfully. Unfortunately, with the exception of the priest, he is the only member of this cast to do so.  Guy Pearce, who endeared himself to me in Memento, is awful.  He looks sickly throughout, and so thin that anyone could blow him over.  Dagmara Dominczyk, as the driving force behind Edmund Dantes actions, is pitiful.  I will admit that her consistently heaving bosom and quivering chin will please many of the audience members, but her character has no substance.  It is hard to imagine that not only does Edmund fall in love with her, but it is because of her that Fernand betrays his friend.  Luis Guzman seems to only be there for some comic relief, which although he managed to do in both Boogie Nights and Traffic, he does not achieve here. It is at the moment that he appears that the film gives up any hope it may have been great. The moment when the Count appears before Parisian society, descending the staircase with his cape billowing behind him in the wind, is amazing. Viewing it in the trailer gave me shivers.  Unfortunately, in order to see it here, you first have to see him come down in a hot air balloon - my companion for the film commented ""Was Cirque de Soleil in the book?"" My recommendation- if you are a fan of the novel, stick to watching the trailer.  If you aren't, and are in the mood for a piece of run-of-the-mill Hollywood action where the good guy is wronged, gets revenge, then gets the girl, go and enjoy.",The Count of Monte Cristo
276,jediwebdude,Engaging story with a satisfying ending.,10,10 February 2002,"This powerful action-drama pulls the viewer into the frustration, anger, and justifiable feelings for revenge. It is done in such a way that the viewer takes satisfaction in the tactical vengeance efforts. Never a dull moment, this brilliant story is brought to the screen with matching brilliance.",The Count of Monte Cristo
277,petepittsburgh,"How's this a good movie let me ""Count"" the ways...",8,28 February 2002,"""Monte Cristo"" was enjoyable on many levels, but what I liked most was the directing effort by Kevin Reynolds. Yea he gave us such stinkers as ""Waterworld"", and ""Robin Hood"". All preconceptions I had of him were gone thirty minutes into the movie. One thing that sticks out is how Reynolds intentionally slowed the movie down drastically with the duration of the jail term. Although many people will tell you this was what they disliked about the movie. Don't let that tree full of fat pigeons make you put your drop-top up. That's what Reynolds wanted to do. See if you didn't feel the world stop just like Dantes(Cavezel) did, and feel his sense of hopelessness it wouldn't have meant anything to you when he gets out! Instead you were cheering him on as he searched for the low-lifes that put him through his ordeal and put you through about half an hour staring at a screen of a guy staring at a wall!   My score 8.2",The Count of Monte Cristo
278,dimturiel,loved it,9,7 April 2002,"The Count of Monte Cristo was one of the best swashbuckling films I'd seen in a while, and it had real heart in it, too. Of course, being a good adaptation from a Dumas novel, that's to be expected. Jim Caviezel was great, and he gave an excellent depiction of his transformation from the guileless Edward Dantes into the scheming Count. His performance carried the film.",The Count of Monte Cristo
279,derekw28,Awesome!Simply Awesome.,10,24 December 2002,"This is an excellent movie!  At first I didn't want to see it but then I came around to it.  I was so happy with myself afterwords.  This movie has suspense, action, and REVENGE!  The actors did a great job.  This will remain one of my favorites for a lifetime to come.10/10",The Count of Monte Cristo
280,Kaarmah,great acting holds it up quite well,7,9 August 2003,"i thought the movie was great until the point when Edmond (Caviezel) stops planning his revenge and puts his planning into action. Then the movie becomes quite boring and looses its suspense.It was great watching how Edmond grew from an innocent man who knew nothing of why he was arrested to this determined and powerful count in search of revenge, especially since Caviezel plays his role so well. But after that the fun is simply over, the rest is only good acting with a story you can see in any other movie.Even though Caviezel played his role really good it was Guy Pearce who stood for the best acting, from beginning to end he was able to have you both hate him and love him at the same time witch is very rare. Another person who played his role very convincing was Michael Wincott who played the Warden of d'If.I give it 7/10 for good acting and a great book turned into an average movie",The Count of Monte Cristo
281,Snooka,"Very, very good!",8,9 January 2003,"This is one of my biggest surprise yet. I didn`t know much about the plot of ""The count of Monte Cristo"", other than it contained a jail-break. I`ve heard people say that i have to see the original, cause it`s ""so"" much better but i hate black/white flicks,and i belive people are just saying it to feel more sofisticated than me. Anyhow, this version really tells the story in a great way, though i missed a little more scenes from the prison. But all over this  is a really great movie. And i belive that we need these kind of films who tells a good story and stays away from too much experimenting.To sum up, this film tells the story well and if you haven`t read the book, you can just watch this one and you`re filled in.8/10",The Count of Monte Cristo
282,bleupython,Enjoyed it as much as the book-- and that is a rarity.,7,11 November 2003,"I think I was in 7th or 8th grade when I read the book, so my memories of it are somewhat cloudy, but it seems like the movie did a great job retelling this classic adventure story.   It had some very nice swashbuckling.  One complaint...I find it hard to believe that you could live on one bowl of soup a day for 13 years and still have enough strength to do the thing that he did.   But, I am willing to overlook that.",The Count of Monte Cristo
283,pypod,Wasn't The Original Plot Good Enough?,6,24 June 2013,"To make room for the numerous and somewhat superfluous action scenes, important plot elements were ignored of changed completely. Perhaps the producers felt that audiences in 2002 would not appreciate the exceptional Dumas plot intact. However, if we forgive the rank liberties taken with Dumas' great work, the movie was above average. Richard Harris was typically brilliant as the learned and venerable Abbe Faria, stealing the show completely. Jim Caviezel was serviceable. His Edmund Dantes was solid, but the spirit of Robert Donat need not feel troubled. Guy Reynolds was very effective, giving both strength and humanity to his Fernand Mondego. Poor Luis Guzman, a fine actor, was over-directed as Jacopo. Dagmara Dominczyk was lovely and convincing as Mercedes. Camera work was superb, and appropriate mood was maintained throughout. Still, with all its good points, this version of the great story doesn't come close to the standard set by the classic 1934 film of the same name.",The Count of Monte Cristo
284,toms615,Excellent - better than the book!,10,21 December 2003,"While the movie does not religiously follow the Dumas book, I found it a better story than the book it was derived from. While the book has too many characters to blend into a screenplay, this film makes the best of the main characters and does an excellent job of summarizing other.Most of all, I like the ending here better than the book, which I find harder to believe (the ending is almost superfluous regarding Edmond's fate).",The Count of Monte Cristo
285,andrea-rockroll,Terrible or worse,1,6 January 2019,"Nothing to do with the original story. It tells about 5 or 10 percent of the real plot of the book. No deepness, no mystery, even no action.
Poor, poor, poor.
The book experience is worth 100 of these movies.",The Count of Monte Cristo
286,zig_utzig,Where is the hate?,2,21 September 2013,"I gave it a 4 and I think I was being kind. In my opinion this film is dreadful. Characters are so poorly built up, the dialogue is so cheesy, the acting and direction seem just lazy and the story is terribly bland. Dantes had been 14 years rotting in a dungeon. Remember Valjean when he leaves prison in Tom Hooper's Les Misreables?? Well, that is more what a man would look like after so many years in a dungeon (actually he would look even worse). But what really changed in Dantes' face after all that time in Château d'If was his expressions and his eyes (he also lost a lot of weight), and that's what made people not recognize him when he returns as Monte Cristo. An actor would have to work very hard to develop such a change. I think Jim Caviezel is a good actor but I guess he did not even bother to try too hard in this film, since it was just an ""action, adventure"" blockbuster (as I said before, lazy acting).Also, Monte Cristo is not the polite party-boy displayed in the movie. He is a grim, dark, mysterious and eccentric powerful man who despises banalities. Monte Cristo is constantly rude actually, but mostly in an elegant and subtle french fashion. He is definitely not a good man, but he's not a bad man either. By the way, this is the biggest flaw in this movie in my opinion: it's just another simple story of good guy versus bad guy. In the original the conspirators were not exactly bad people. Some of them were envious, others were ambitious and some were both. But for most of them it was a very hard decision to do what they did to Dantes and his father. But they did it and had to live with that (which was hard for most of them for some time - until they forget it like people usually do).Finally, Monte Cristo is a man full of hate and vengeance; people tremble inside when he's around. He has no love left in his heart; kindness is something that was completely taken away from him (I definitely did not see that in the character displayed in the movie). There is no happy ending here because this is not a happy story. But I guess a sad and dark story like that is not what people look for when they pay for an ""adventure"" film. People want happy endings and good guys marrying good girls and killing the bad guys and I'm fine with that, really. If some studio wants to tell this kind of story they can go ahead and do it, I don't mind. But it's nothing more than a scam to use the popularity of other people's work to attract the audience's attention.",The Count of Monte Cristo
287,Invert48,Count On a Good Movie,10,5 December 2004,"MY personal favorite movie. I love the clever concept of revenge. The story is very clear and to the point, not a confusing mind boggling one. This movie is full of great actors like Jim Caviezel (High Crimes, The Passion) Guy Pearce (The Time Machine), and Richard Harris. This movie is filled with drama action and cunning plans and ideas. This is a story about revenge and with revenge comes cleverness and this movie understands that. This movie is intense and exciting and despite its time it's a fun movie for almost any age. Not only is this my all time favorite movie it has one of the best fight scenes at the end too. This is a movie you can not only see once. This movie is a 29 scene movie, but never the less is such an adventure you wouldn't notice until it's over. The first thing that entered my head what the movie was over was, that it was the best movie I have ever seen. I give this movie a... 5/5",The Count of Monte Cristo
288,sallyahill,The Count Of Monty Python,9,26 March 2006,"But why 9/10 for a compete disregard to the masterpiece from Alexandre Dumas? I love the book and Alexandre Dumas, so why do I like the film? Maybe it is because the film is so different from the book that I can accept it as a piece from Hollywood, taking a few plot lines from the book. For example, the film showed a Monsieur Clarion happily strutting around. Please compare that to the character equivalent in the book to Monsieur Clarion, called Monsieur Nortier, a paraplegic who spoke with his eyes, as shown in the earlier film. And then of course the ending: like Casablanca it stabs me in the heart. It is a wonderful ending, but has nothing to the ending in the book, where you can tell that Mercedes still loved Dantes, but she also loves her son. It would have been more wise to change all the characters names and the title and then they wouldn't have had to pay recognition to Alexandre Dumas. This film does hold a good script, some very good acting and good character representations, like Guy Pierce as Fernand.

It is an excellent movie - the top of both our lists. My wife and I truly enjoyed the film. There is something for everyone... Action. Romance. Excellent character relationships. Plus a type of sentiment you don't usually see from Hollywood... and keeps you at the edge of your seat with a good surprising plot twist in the end(if you haven't read the book) If you want to escape into a good flick.

291,galthos,This Film Adaptation Subverts the Book's Revenge Theme,4,14 October 2019,"In its own right, it's an OK film. However, it's obvious the director(s) changed the plot from the book to make it more appealing to the masses and in doing so eliminated what I felt made the story so meaningful. In true Hollywood fashion, Edmond gets both his revenge and his woman back. The book is not like that. Edmond gets his revenge but in so doing completely burns the bridge between himself and Mercedes. He recognized that life would never go back to the way it was before he was falsely accused and incarcerated; he knew that Mercedes had most likely moved on. In the novel, Edmond finds a another woman in the end but still insisted on carrying out his revenge plot against his enemies.Several other plot points were changed as well, which I will not take the time to discuss. The acting and dialogue were just meh. This film can help pass the time on a dull Saturday afternoon, but it is a pale imitation of its source material.",The Count of Monte Cristo
292,coue,Too many armchair critics here.,9,5 February 2002,"This movie is an excellent movie which does extremely well what a movie is supposed to do, which is, entertain. A two hours plus, it was perhaps too short to render the novel full justice, but so what. During these two hours you are treated to excellent photography, fantastic scenery, lavish sets, good acting, nice costumes, action, plot twists, and something that Hollywood could give us more of, intrigue. Indeed if there is a shortcoming it is this one. The shenanigans of the Count could have been more developed as I found this part of the film quite satisfying. The Revenge was too short and the downfall of the evil characters too quick.  No matter, it delivers so well on all other fronts that I say go see it!8.5 out of 10.",The Count of Monte Cristo

Having never read the book, I had no real opinions going in, but I have heard that the book is really good. The acting is pretty good, especially the always great Guy Pearce as the once friend turned nemesis of the main character. It really wasn't anything special, it got a little cheezy several times in the movie and there are LOTS of errors also, like things that weren't invented back then and stuff. See it if there is nothing else you want to see thats out, but I suggest you save your money and see the Royal Tenebaums, Amelie or Vanilla Sky and just rent the Count of Monte Cristo when it comes out.",The Count of Monte Cristo

I was definitely excited to see this movie because of that.  If I'd had a pen and paper, I could have listed all that did not ""match"". So, if you have never read the book: 1. The acting was great. 2. The writing was great. 3. The actors and actresses themselves were great (and sexy). In all, the entire movie was superb.  I really enjoyed it.If you have read the book (over and over) like myself: 1. The movie is titled ""Alexander Dumas' The Count of Monte Cristo"" but it should be called ""Loosely based on Alexander Dumas' The Count of Monte Cristo"". 2. The story is good, but unrealistic.  The book follows ""real-world"" values... like the Hero doesn't have to end up with the Girl, and so on.

I had no intention of seeing this film, and furthermore, the day I saw it, I wasn't in the right mood to do anything at all. As a matter of a fact, I was probably in the worst mood of my life. And from the opening shot of this movie, my horrible mood was swept from the depths of hell and brought into a wonderfully new light for a mere 2 hours and 15 minutes. This movie had it all. Love, decieving, betrayal, greed, and above all...revenge.A man named Dantes gets set up by his best friend Mandago, only to be accused and imprisoned for a crime he didnt commit. We see his loneliness, his unfulfillment, his suffering, and we're right there alongside him, feeling his anguish. But when he learns economics, math, reading, writing and swordplay from a fellow inmate, we know that should he escape, his long-awaited revenge will not only be emotionally absorbing, but tactfully skillful. And when he does get revenge....boy, is it SWEET. Never have I seen such a bad-ass act of revenge on screen EVER. It is SO cool. Jim Caviezel, who plays the insanely vengeful title role...he is so damned...radiant!! He looks so freakin cool, too! He is definitely on the top of my list of bad-ass good-guy/bad-guy roles.

A few of the main characters were completely ignored. The way he rewards his friends is shown in a jiffy. There is no feeling of gratitude shown by his friends (since they don't exist).

301,jss_brown,good if you haven't read the book,6,8 February 2002,"""The Count of Monte Cristo"" is one of my favorite books so I was excited but wary to see yet another movie interpretation.  I have to say that I was very disappointed.  The glaring inconsistencies with the book were too shocking for me to enjoy the movie.  I don't know what book the movie was based on but it wasn't the same one I read. Most movie interpretations change many small details and even several large points in the plot to hollywood-ize the movie.  The changes from the book were so large, however, that ALMOST NOTHING was the same.  Not only did they change the plot so much so that the themes changed, but they also altered several smaller points that would not have affected the movie.  For example, Valentine is the daughter of M. de Villefort in the book, but, although this daughter isn't in the movie, the movie has Villefort's wife's named Valentine!  This change accomplishes nothing besides irritating fans of the book.  To be fair, however, my friends who hadn't read the book very much enjoyed the movie.  Thus, this movie is pretty good as a movie as long as you forget that it's supposed to be based on the book.  So my advice is to see this movie if you haven't read the book but avoid it at all costs if you have.",The Count of Monte Cristo

But the same truth can be said regarding most film adaptations of masterly written works.For me, having read Dumas and seen the 1975 film adaptation, I found this rendition more than satisfactory. Its a shame that for most of us who have read, will always want to hark back and compare it to the book. I think that to do such, would be wrong. One has to realise that to faithfully recreate the book on screen would have taken better part of six hours plus run-time, after final edit to make the story coherent. Not to mention maintaining the level of drama and intensity of acting in that time frame. Instead one should see the film for what it is... a good retelling not a remake.Peace's performance as Count Mondego and Caviezel's Dantes are truly refreshing.

Last night it was on TV and i saw that it actually wasn't all that bad. The costumes and locations are fantastic, so you get more than your fair share of pretty pictures. Jim Caviezel is a bit two dimensional in his role, but then again Dumas isn't really noted for his realistic characters and Caviezel does manage to pull off the innocence of the first half AND the disillusionment and thirst of revenge in the second. My favourite part of the movie is when he and the priest are digging for freedom and he gets Zorro-like lessons in both weaponry and philosophy.There must be worst ways of getting through your jail sentence! It did look like a concession to a generation brought up with the karate kid, but all the same, it's amusing. In fact, my only criticism of the movie is that it was too obvious that they'd slashed out more than half the book.

310,SimbadM,a revelation through the performance of the leading actors,9,27 April 2004,"I saw this movie after watching the 1974 version, starring Richard Chamberlain. I have to say that maybe the novel's plot was better respected by that version. But yet, this new one has been extremely enjoyable because it contained a lot of good acting. And to my surprise, I found Jim Caviezel to be a better Monte Cristo than Chamberlain, in fact the best I've seen until now. And that not because Chamberlain wasn't true to the character's spirit, but because Caviezel looks a lot more like Dumas' Monte Cristo. Just as strong, calm and resolved as one would expect him to be. And a lot more man like.Dagmara made the first Mercedes true to the novel's description of her, of a surprising and exquisite beauty. Harris gave a very true and dramatic interpretation of Faria.The change of the plot in the end was unexpected, but rewarding to me, since that kind of ending fitted my childhood dreams. I knew the book by heart when I was ten, and fell in love with Monte Cristo after seing the Chamberlain movie. This new version starring Caviezel makes me want to read the book again, since now I have a perfect image of how the character is like, provided by his acting. It is a great story to watch, but one who wants to know how the original plot is really like should also read the book.",The Count of Monte Cristo
311,andyr89,The Count of Monte Cristo Delivers,10,23 December 2004,"The Count of Monte Cristo is a solid movie. The characters are all realistic and well acted. What really gives this movie such strong backing is the actors and how they truly deliver all emotions to the viewer. Each character presents something to the viewer which helps us understand and very much so enjoy this movie.The movie moves along at a steady rate, which keeps you glued to your seat to find out what will happen next. The storyline plays through well and allows us to understand what is happening to everyone in the film, without missing out on the action that also adds to this film.The action in the film is another bonus that gives some more enjoyment to the viewer. Though never too violent the action is good for all ages as good entertainment.Overall The Count of Monte Cristo delivers on all cylinders and is a great watch for anyone.",The Count of Monte Cristo
312,naslapi,a slaughter of the origin,1,30 November 2007,"I cannot understand why this film got high score. I guess that around 97% of the people that have rated it, did not read the actual book. To those that did though, this film is one of the worst slaughters of a good story. I understand that in adapting a story to the screen, there is a need of shortening it here and editing it there, but this film version is so far from the origin that it becomes a total different story. I'm asking you, why to take a perfect interesting book (that since it was published in 1844) become a bestseller in so many countries and in so many languages) and to change it to a cheap romantic novel? Some would say that it is done so, because of the audience demand, but I say that such demand comes because Hollywood prefer to create bad movies with the commercial attraction to the less intelligent crowd. To any one that had read the unabridged Dumas' The Count of Monte Cristo and enjoyed it, this film is nothing but a terrible why of spending over 90 minutes.",The Count of Monte Cristo
313,animallover1136,Never Judge a Movie By It's Case.,10,1 March 2014,"May I begin by saying that I was truly blown away by this movie! The first time I saw it was in my theater class in school, we were having a movie day and our teacher said that this was his all time favorite, and when he put the movie in we all rolled our eyes at the opening title, and I heard several kids whisper, ""Nap-time."" In the end it took us three classes to watch the movie, and after it was over, we were all hanging off of our seats in amazement. This movie has officially been deemed my FAVORITE! This movie had the most amazing mix of suspense, romance, action, revenge, and just about anything you can imagine! Every scene pulls you farther into the plot until you find your self guilty of yelling out loud like you're actually a part of one of the sword fights.

This is barely the same story. If you have read Alexandre Dumas' book, You will be disappointed to find that this storyline shares almost nothing with the book, except the title.

316,lindsey_konrad,Better if you haven't read the book!,6,26 August 2005,"Before I get into the review, may I just say, ""Read the book!"" It is phenomenal! I could not put it down and I now own it. That said, I must say that the first time I saw the film version starring Jim Cavaziel and Guy Pearce, I was terribly disappointed. Not that the performances were bad, but it was quite unlike the book and I, unfortunately a purist, had major issues with all the divergences from the original plot. I have no desire to spoil the movie for anyone, so if you would like to see what I mean, please read the book. I went away from the movie quite upset, but I have seen it a few times since then and I have to say that, though it is no match for the book, it does stand quite well on its own. If one were to go into the movie knowing nothing of the story, it would be quite enjoyable. The performances by Cavaziel, as the vengeful Count, and Pearce, as the villainous Fernando, are without equal. Cavaziel smolders with pent-up rage and Pearce slithers his way through every scene like the snake his character is. Wonderful! To be honest, I do have to say that the woman playing Mercedes was not convincing, nor was the actor who played her son, Albert, but in the face of the other great performances, this is not really a big issue. It is unfortunate that the leading lady felt her character needed to be a weak, sighing woman, which in the book she is decidedly not, but I choose to forgive this because really, the rest of the movie is fantastic. Every human emotion is captured in this picture, from rage to disappointment, love to hate. I would recommend this movie, though with the proviso that if you have read the book, don't expect the movie to overly faithful. In fact, you may want to watch a few times so you can fully appreciate the differences!",The Count of Monte Cristo

It is a thin veil which sometimes is white and gives hope and sometimes is black and is marked by blood and revenge. Great acting overall. Few movies and even fewer scenes have managed to electrocute me in such a way that this movie and especially particular scenes which I won't go into details about the Count have impressed me this much. I think this movie deserves a lot more then it got. It's simple, very much into the recreating the original, and with a powerful message of hope in a strange way.

Not for a second will you leave this movie to think about something else going on while it plays. Even the beautiful setting submerses you without being showy about it - allowing the story to tell itself, and it does so with absolute precision. I have watched over 2,000 movies in my day, and this is a top 10, again and again. It will withstand the test of time for many many years to come.

I went into this movie with the notion it would be great, and I was surprised how much better it was than that!  I won't go into any detail because I don't want to spoil an ounce of the film for anyone, but I will say it's a 'Must See'.  Great performances all around by a great cast.  A strong leading performance by James Caviezel, which may lead to him in more ""hunky"" or ""sexy"" rolls.  I can't count the number of times after the show I heard the women in our group saying about Caviezel: ""I never realized how good-looking he is!  He has the most beautiful eyes.""  Also, don't be surprised if young Henry Cavill starts popping up in more rolls.  Anyway, I give this film a 9/10, 3 1/2 stars, a solid 'green light' - whichever you choose.  Just make sure you go see this movie.  People were actually applauding afterwards.",The Count of Monte Cristo

But I didn't want to read it because it was too good, ala Schindler's List.  I didn't want to read it because the movie made me believe that this classic piece of literature had major flaws.  I don't really think the book suffers from these flaws but the movie's flaws were integral to the story so much so that if the movie stayed even reasonably faithful to the book, then the book must also be as flawed.I saw the movie with a group of four other people, two of which were seeing it a second time, and I was the only person who didn't like it.  And at this time, the average (weighted) score on IMDB is 8.  I find it hard to believe that the majority of the population can shut off their minds for such an intellectual movie.  However, being that the story was so convoluted and complicated, it is understandable if you might find it difficult to follow and you might look at the other properties of the movie: the scenery, the lavish costumes, the couple of fighting scenes, the (always fun) prison break, the humor.  But none of these positives can outweigh the mistakes and loose ends.  I won't go into them.  I don't like giving away movies' details (unless the movie is that bad).

And, I had rented it after seeing ""The Muskateer"", so after seeing that movie, I had little expectations for Monte Cristo. Muskateer promised much, and delivered little, so I had half expected Monte Cristo to produce the same results...it didn't.Monte Cristo is a wonderful blend of action, romance, drama, and comedy all rolled into one. The acting is first rate...especially the lead roles (Guy Pearce is rapidly becoming a favorite of mine), although the role of Mercedes could have been casted better. I was not a fan of how she was portrayed and felt that the producers could have gone in a different direction.The sword play in the movie is top notch.

These were the conditions in which I watched the first public viewing of the Count of Monte Cristo.  We did have one ""Star"" there, Kevin Reynolds was in the audience and he didn't look overly enthused by the audience's reaction at the end, they weren't exactly giving it a standing ovation. Anyway what of the film.  I ought to warn you that I haven't read the book so I can't say whether it was faithful to the story or not, but a guy in the discussion group seemed to think that it was fairly faithful, bar some omissions that were needed to squeeze it into it's just over 2 hour running time. The story is fun with some great twists appearing in the final third of the film.  It revolves around the complicated inter-relationships of three friends over a period of around twenty years in France during the latter years of Napoleon's life.  Woven into this story are a lot of characters but unfortunately there are only a few that we are ever given a real insight into.  But these characters are fascinating and the actors playing them are great.  Special note should go to Guy Pierce who played an unusual character very strongly.  But the show was stolen by Richard Harris who not only brought a light touch to the film just as it was beginning to get quite depressing, but also added a much needed sense of gravitas to the story. The locations were great, as were the costumes.  The music was awful, but everybody complained about that so hopefully they'll change it.  The film had too long a build up and the third act was bogged down by needless socialising scenes used to show us that the Count of Monte Cristo was fitting into society when we had already accepted that fact. If the film gets tightened up and they sort out the music it will be a good swashbuckingly adventure, but it isn't going to be a great film that you want to watch again and again.",The Count of Monte Cristo

I can understand when the original work needs to be compromised in order to adapt the work to film due to constraints of the media, however, in this case the film in so many ways this film went completely astray. If you are going to make a movie from an original masterpiece you should attempt to be as true as possible to the original work, however, it is clear that the script writers had little imagination on how to dramatize and remain true to the original work. Instead, they invented new things and changed the original story to ""make it more exciting"". The script for this movie is a result of cheap Hollywood tricks and lack of respect for the original work. I wanted to list all the things that have been changed, but that would take too long and I cannot justify the time spent.Overall as a movie without the book I would give it a 7, but due to the fact that it could have been so much more if it stuck to the original I give it a 4.",The Count of Monte Cristo

This is one of the greatest revenge stories ever written.  How could a filmmaker go wrong? Lots of ways, apparently.  The casting was fine -- Jim Caviezel and Guy Pierce were very good, although the actress playing the love interest, Mercedes, was simply a pretty face.  But most of the additions and changes from the book (an old favorite of mine) were heavy-handed and served to make the story both more obvious and a lot less fun -- such as the added religious overtones which were badly handled, and the added sex scenes which were abominable and pointless.  Dramatic storytelling skills more or less fell to the wayside, apparently, when this was put together.  A shame. The basic story is so good that the audience couldn't help but be thrilled by parts of it, but it was still a shadow of the film that a more intelligent writer or director could have made.",The Count of Monte Cristo

I have since read the book and was completely blown away by this amazing page turner. After re-watching the movie I was completely underwhelmed. Apart from the basic story line and the names of the characters they have little in common. It would have been next to impossible to recreate Dumas' original idea and keep the movie at a reasonable length at the same time but I'm sure something better could have been done. I was disappointed to see that some of the main characters were missing,which was most disappointing as their stories are every bit as important to the plot as Edmonds or DeVilleforts. All of the side stories were disregarded also and the ending was completely changed, and not for the better. The count is not subtle enough at all in this movie,rushing into his vengeance with extreme haste and little thought. As Edmond, he's depicted as a moronic fool who is too easily led and far too innocent. All in all it's a good movie but it doesn't do the original story any favors.",The Count of Monte Cristo

The book portrays in a graphic way what happens when imperfect man takes it upon himself the role of avenger for wrongs, real or perceived. Sometimes the innocent suffer needlessly, which brings great remorse. In the movie there was none of that; Hollywood ""artistic license"" allowed the ""fairytale ending"" with everyone (except the bad guys) living happily ever after.

Every role played by an actor or actress was successfully well-done. James Caviezel played the extraordinary role of Edmund Dantes (The Count of Monte Cristo). He adds the attitude, guts, and pure ability to take on a role like this. Guy Pierce plays Dantes' ""friend"", Fernand Mondego, who betrays him in order to have Mercedes (Dagmara Dominczyk, Dantes' fiancee) to be his wife. He is a person who acts with such intenseness, you actually believe him.After Fernand betrays Edmund, Edmund is thrown in prison where he is punished every year on the day he arrives by the ""master villain"" Michael Wincott himself. In Wincott's past engagements, such as being Gary Soneji (Along Came A Spider), and Top Dollar (The Crow), he adds in a touch to his evil side as Dorleac, the man in charge of the prison.If you would like to know more about the movie, I'm sorry to admit, but you'll really have to see it yourself and experience the breathtaking film of excitement, adventure, and in some cases: humor.

345,pratrincewind,For the Literary Impaired.............,1,28 July 2007,"This has to be one of the worst book adaptations I have ever seen. I've read the book about 5 years before I watched the movie and I must say that the book is FANTASTIC, compared to this hogwash. Although I forgot most of the characters' names and parts of the plot, I still recognized a crappy scaled down movie. It's simplified in the usual American style. I apologize to the literate part of Americans who have read the novel which is probably the most popular adventure novel in history.The plot doesn't even match the book. The only true part of the movie is the prison If sequence, and that's also changed, even though that part of the novel piles up to maybe 100 pages! I possibly exaggerated, but since the whole novel is 1000-1300 (depends on the publisher) that's almost a tiny part of the novel, and they had the nerve not get it right! The other aspects of this novel-to-movie adaptation gone horribly wrong are as follows. Most important characters are either gone or changed altogether. Benedetto, Caderousse, Bertuccio, Haydée, Ali, Baptistin are all missing from the movie, with many more to follow. 99% of the script doesn't have anything to do with the plot of the book. Even the fates of Mondego, Danglars and Villefort have been altered. Mondego doesn't commit suicide, Villefort doesn't go to a mental asylum and, most importantly, Danglars isn't forgiven by Dantes.I recommend the mini-series with Gerard Depardieu but it also has changes, but not so much as this brain dead movie. The only complaint about the series, as well as the movie, is the change in the end of the story. Originally Dantes continues his life with Haydee NOT with Mercedes as is depicted in every adaptation.All in all, this is a very f#$#*ed up movie. Don't watch it!

The theme of the movie basically is REVENGE, an emotion so strong that can take everything away feelings, friends, and family in a flash. An emotion where you want to get your reward at any cost. With this in mind, Edward Dantes ( Jim Caviezel) is a very good actor by showing honesty and loyalty and the hatred he builds up towards his ""friend"" Fernand Mondego ( Guy Pierce)through his body and facial responses. He starts very humble as a sailor while his friend, Fernand Mondego, is a son of a Count. Although the friendship may seem real and honest Mondego is very envious of what Dantes has, from the little whistle when he got from his birthday, to the present, where he will have a beautiful wife and a son( you will find out towards the end of the movie). The plot will later change and it has an incredible twist that will take you by surprise. The surprise where Mondego denounces Dantes and the act of treason is committed, by the father of J.F. Villefort,and the treason is also kept quiet. As Mondego take his wife he later builds up revenge and nothing else matters. Through the movie he makes new friends and new enemies, he becomes rich and his plot of revenge is taking effect. As revenge being the only thing that kept him alive, he later understands the biblical passage ""God will give me justice"" that was carved on the wall.",The Count of Monte Cristo
349,christianvomlehn,well told story,9,20 July 2002,"Although this movie doesn't stick to book at all, it's well told and the actors do a great job.  The Count of Monte Cristo has been adapted to the big screen many times, but this is a new updated version of the classic story.  This is a story that doesn't hurt from being retold.  Caviezel is fantastic as the man seeking revenge and Pearce is impressive as well. The storytelling is top-notch and the overall atmosphere of the film is overwhelming.  If you come expecting to see the word for word adaptation of the book you'll probably be disappointed.  However, should you keep an open mind you'll find the movie quite satisfying.",The Count of Monte Cristo
350,wsoto3,I love it (loosely base on the movie though),8,14 March 2013,"It's loosely based on the book, but I still like it very much.I've seen the 1975 version which is more like the book, but seems too rush and without much character development. I have yet to see the 1998 miniseries. I think this movie captures the essence of Dumas book, although it made a lot of changes to the original story, but I didn't mind that, and liked this ending better than the book. This is a tale of revenge, and it's done well. it's engaging and entertaining, and I do think that makes you want to read the book. Overall I really recommend this movie. If you loved the book, I suggest you see it with open eyes, taking into account it makes a lot of changes including the ending. But you still will have an amazing revenge tale and I think it's a very enjoyable movie. Give it a chance.",The Count of Monte Cristo
351,sander_de_jong,"Inspired by, not based on, the book",6,6 July 2011,"By pure coincidence I saw the movie only two days after I had finished reading the book (over 1,000 pages). So I had an excellent opportunity to judge the movie, to see how truthfully it would follow the book. And I was curious which actors would play which characters. I had already seen on IMDb that Haidee was not listed.  Almost immediately you can see that the movie is more inspired by, than based on the book. The names are usually taken from the book, the roles they play are similar to the roles in the book, but many times you're in for a surprise. Of course, it is not possible to put 1,000 pages in a tolerably long movie, so some shortcuts can be understood. The story of the carnival in Rome can easily be shortened from many chapters to a few minutes. Other story lines are also cut short. But: in the book, both Fernand and Mercedes are poor in the beginning. In the movie they're rich! In the book the mount of MC does not kill or harm anyone directly, in the movie he does. These are notable deviations from the book that don't appear to be shortcuts. And in the movie Edmond Dantes is whipped once a year, while in prison. In the book this simply doesn't happen. And of course, the movie was made in the 21st century, the book was written in the 19th century, so some changes are to be expected: more action, more fighting, more sex. So... if you're looking for a straight translation from book to movie, move along, this is not for you. I really missed Haidee! So what about this movie on its own? Well... I give it a 6. It's all too rushed, too hasty. And, having read the book, I know how good it could have been. The only character true to the book was, in my opinion, Abbe Faria. Well, there are many other movies about the count of MC, so plenty of alternatives.",The Count of Monte Cristo
352,kodi_68,Maybe a bit too much,7,11 September 2002,"I thought the movie was shot well and in terms of suspending belief, I was fooled from time to time.  I never read the book, so I don't care about comparisons.I kept waiting for some kind of old cheesy music (dun-dun-duhhhh) at the end of every scene towards the end.  The plot was a bit rushed and maybe a bit too involved for a movie of this length.Overall an entertaining movie, but definitely not an epic.",The Count of Monte Cristo
353,glatouf,My favorite movie ever,10,5 December 2002,"Wow... This movie was absolutely amazing! I saw the other version of this movie with Gerard Depardieu as Edmond Dantes and it wasn't as good as this one. Alexandre Dumas' books are one great source of inspiration for movies. Doing this movie with one of his best novel was a great idea. I think that the crew made it wonderfully good. The choice of James Caviezel as the principal actor was brillant. He has a lot of ""high class society"" charm. I have to admit that my favorite moment is when he gives his party at his new palace. He just walks to see his guests after an unbelivable entry and say something like ""Good evening"" and then go away (I only have the french version so I don't know what he really says in english). I was (and still am) astonished by this particular scene. It leaves you breathless. He would have say ""the revenge beggins"" and it would have been the same thing. As for the landscape that we saw during the movie...I was very impressed. Congradulations to everyone who worked on this movie, I only have great comments. Thanks!",The Count of Monte Cristo
354,aan_allean,A tragedy turned to travesty...,1,30 October 2002,"This movie has one thing going to it.  Many people have never actually read the book.  The only person who could possibly enjoy it is one who knows absolutely nothing about what really happens in the novel.  In fact there is only one part in the entire movie that is fairly accurate and that is the part in which our hero is in prison, although much of that is distorted beyond belief too.It is a shame that someone could come forth and so butcher a wonderful novel like The Count of Monte Cristo, but this movie makes it seem like a bad daytime soap opera.  On a personal note to the director, please in the future, write your own story to destroy, don't kill a masterpiece.",The Count of Monte Cristo
355,herbertificus,Excellent Remake Of A Classic Tale,9,2 August 2012,"Suffice it to say that this is one of the best stories in literature and that when done well on film it is extremely entertaining.In this version, everything is very well done. Everything.The one note that I wanted to convey is that while the directing is superb and all of the acting is absolutely flawless, Guy Pearce is the standout performance in this movie. The blue-blooded, self-important character he creates in speech and attitude and mannerism is nothing less than awe-inspiring. His performance here is what makes the celluloid translation of black-and-white words on a page so rich and rewarding to watch.Unfortunately, not every role in a script is susceptible of such striking translation -- some characters are simply more mundane. It is, however, very fortuitous when a character of such cinematic potential is portrayed by such a dynamic actor who puts immense energy into the portrayal.Kudos to both Guy Pearce and director Kevin Reynolds.And not to neglect the rest of the cast -- they were all excellent. In fact, kudos to the casting crew because every single character was cast superbly. From the demurring Jim Kaviezel to the earthy Luis Guzman to venerable Richard Harris and all the rest, the casting crew NAILED every single character with an excellent choice of actor. It's expertise such as this that sets the foundation for an excellent production. And when coupled with mature directing and precise editing, the totality of the effect is the superb finished work-of-art that is this film.",The Count of Monte Cristo
356,bollan,Brilliant new version of an old classic.,10,18 February 2003,"Wow was my first impression after this film. Brilliant version of an old time classic. Beautiful scenes and great fotage. Filmed in fantastic surroundings. James Caviezel interprets The Count surprisingly well. By far the best version of a ""Monte Cristo"" movie. Go and see it!!!!!!",The Count of Monte Cristo
357,scardface,Epic... Just Epic!!!,10,21 December 2010,"Revenge!!!! Revenge!!! Revenge!!! One of life's more satisfying emotions come to life in such grandiose fashion in this film. One thing that all great movies share in my opinion is yes a great story, but more specifically, one in which the audience is able to feel for. Tarrantino did this very well with Inglorious Bastards by taking the audience onto a ride throughout the film and finally arriving at a stop where everybody is laughing and feeling overjoyed watching Nazis being murdered. Same is done in this film. The story can be slow at variations in this film but the build up to certain scenes is what creates the 'epicness' (sorry to use this word) of the film. WIthout going into details of the film, the audience is dragged through the lead characters tragic happenings and is finally capable of embarrassing the sweet taste of revenge, alongside Jim Caviezel. Everybody can relate to strong sentiment of revenge. It's a great carnal feeling that everybody exhibits on some level. It's human nature, and when a story can display its true grit and emancipation, it makes for one heck of a movie.Once you parlay the storyline and such with the great cast of actors, you are bound for something special, never mind the fact that the movie is based on a novel masterpiece in Alexandre Dumas' ""The Count of Monte Cristo"". Caviezel and Pierce play great counterparts in this film and as both friends and bitter rivals, they balance each other out quite beautifully. I really enjoyed watching these two face each other throughout the movie.The film deals with many interesting themes that can lead to great discussion. The idea of redemption is integral not only to the tale of revenge, but plays well within the overriding theme of religion which is made clear to the audience on several occasions. ""God will give me justice"", as is often recanted in the film provides great servitude to the idea of never giving up and always looking forward. It's an aspect of the film that provides closure to the film once revenge has been served and justice has been replaced. Friendship was very important to me as I viewed the film, not only through the relationship of the two main characters, but more importantly in the importance of friendship and how such underlings can lead people out of obscurity and can help others along in their paths. The friendship between Edmund and the pirate is fantastic and really shows its pure strenght. Finally the friendship that is created by Edmund and the priest inside the prison leads both out of obscurity and into salvation.Stop reading and go watch it!!!",The Count of Monte Cristo
358,fakepurseninja,"Not the book, but nonetheless fun",9,25 September 2004,"If you want Dumas's novel, forget it. As said above, this movie is not the book. What it is is an old-fashioned, swashbuckling adventure story with some great, although cheesy, dialogue and a solid cast. Guy Pierce is absolutely fantastic as Mondego. You hate him so much by the end of the film that you would like nothing better to see him dead. Caveziel offers a very strong performance as Edmond, although he is not quite as believable as Pierce. Richard Harris is great. The movie is an enjoyable one, much lighter than the novel and with a happier ending. It is true, it is only loosely based on the book, but it is nonetheless an excellent movie. Highly recommended for the adventure fan.",The Count of Monte Cristo
359,jjeffries68,Excellent adaptation of the Dumas story,9,5 July 2011,"I'm a purist by nature. Usually, if the movie strays from the book, it annoys me greatly, as though some thoughtless studio suit decided to change the story in the book to make sure it ""better fits our target demographic"". This movie is the rare exception to that rule. I found the characters here to be well developed, and the acting first rate. Jim Caviezel's transformation from innocent young man to callous older gentleman is quite extraordinary, as is the acting for the rest of the cast. I can't remember seeing a more beautiful & feminine lead actress than Dagmara Dominczyk; she's absolutely enchanting in this part. The casting of the other characters is spot on, down to Richard Harris as the priest and Luis Guzman as Jacopo. Guy Pierce also pulls off an excellent acting job; he's an amoral cad that you actually become invested in. The ending is different than originally written (see my first 2 sentences above), but is curiously more emotionally satisfying than the book; in this case, I think the movie ending got it right. All in all, this is my favorite adaptation of Dumas's book, despite the different ending. I'd recommend it to anyone who's interested in seeing a thrilling action movie which contains romance, and is surprisingly spiritual without being preachy. 9/10.",The Count of Monte Cristo

361,vpero2001,Would have been a good vehicle for Errol Flynn...,1,23 July 2006,"This film deserved its lack of success, and the other reviews here read as though they were written by the cast and crew in a vain attempt to make failure look like success.The ending of the film effectively negates most of what has gone before. The morality of the revenge sought by Dantes and the swashbuckling swordfight are not the issues to be addressed. Rather, in the adaptation, much of the early parts of the story could have been told effectively in abbreviated flashback, the more intricate and important parts... the later sections and climax and conclusion... should have been the focus of the film. Dantes redemption is in his ultimate sacrifice. Revenge lies within his grasp. In fact, he has partially achieved it. And then, he is confronted with a true moral dilemma. What that dilemma is, and how it helps Dantes resolve his conflict, without the ""happy resolution"" depicted in the film, is where the focus of the story belongs. See the Robert Donat version.",The Count of Monte Cristo
362,DarkLordNache,Action is overrated,9,14 June 2004,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is right up there with Minority Report and the Lord of the Ring trilogy. This film is rich with character development you just don't see in a whole lot of movies today. I would have liked the final fight scene to be a bit longer, but other than that a truly great movie. I loved the scene in the spa or whatever it was where The Count of Monte Cristo is talking to the lawyer guy and turning up the steam. I love when people trap the bad guys like that. It just makes you want to stand up and yell, ""Oh yeah! You got served!"" But you don't because you are the one holding the popcorn.

In this day and age of fast pace films that often focus excessively on special effects, it is refreshing to see a movie that actually takes time to develop the characters and set the stage for what becomes an adventurous ride that the whole family can enjoy. Old timer Richard Harris was perfect in the role of Edmond's mentor and prison mate. Jim Caviezel I always enjoy and he did not disappoint.",The Count of Monte Cristo
364,SCViper,"Good acting, horrible script",5,30 July 2005,"People have been far too kind to this movie. Although the script greatly deviates from the book, that is not the main problem, not by a long shot. To put it bluntly the script is absolutely horrible. The action fails to reveal the dramatism of the moment most of the time, the dialogs are very rigid, idiotic sometimes, even if the actors do the best they can do with such material. The reason the movie got such high marks is because no matter how much they screwed it up it is still based on a fantastic book, and I think that says a lot about the book.Getting back to the differences between the book and the script, there are many things to be said; the script completely fails to reveal the cleverness and meticulosity of Edmond Dantes in dealing with the people that betrayed him. Their fates are almost too kind in comparison to what happens to them in the book. Even the fate of Villefort, which is decent in the movie, is like a blessing compared to the madness he goes through in Dumas's book. The book also did a splendid job in further developing the villains, showing the flaws of their characters, while the movie COMPLETELY misses this crucial part. The Count of Monte Cristo's richness and extravagance are merely bad taste in the movie (yes, this includes the damn balloon...). The book gave exceptional details about the efforts the Count puts into building his extravagant image, the movie only shows a party with some extremely bad dialogs. Not a good trade in my opinion. Faria is also poorly represented, from the great mentor and wise man he was in the book he becomes just a tutor for Edmond in the movie; his death is lame and the escape is very rushed and ""hollywood""-like. The point of all this is that all the character exposition and development that went on in the book is completely gone in the movie.There are also many, many things that were left out of the movie, some (important) characters, some good plot points. Some characters were simply killed (Villefort's father for example) to greatly simplify the plot. I understand this, since the writer had to cram 3 volumes into a two hour movie, but this is almost like badly done video compression: small size, but very poor quality.All in all, if you haven't read the book go watch the movie, you'll probably enjoy it to some extent, but any fan of the original masterpiece should steer clear of this, for it is indeed painful to watch.",The Count of Monte Cristo

366,anacondak3,Now you are basking under sunlight next time you see yourself in shattered stones,9,10 February 2013,"Movie Review The Count of Monte Cristo What is movie but an amalgam of events and consequences based on the fact that ""Nature always imparts justice"", The story revolves round the life of a man who is failed by one of his best friends and is trapped in a web of plots and plans, eventually he succeeds in breaking all the hurdles and then re-appearing against his enemies by showing his vengeance in a fair and same manner as he was done earlier. The movie is directed by Kelvin Reynolds; based on the Novel ""The Count of Monte Cristo"", by Alexander Dumas. The main dialogue of the movie reveals a hard fact that, ""Now, you are basking under Sunlight, The next moment waiting to be shattered on rocks"" The story of the movie moves round the Napoleonic Era, as in 1814, French Emperor Napoléon is exiled in the land of Elba, off coast shore of Italy. Fearing an attempt to rescue him, his British captors are ordered to shoot anyone who is seen in Elba offshore, no matter how desperate or innocent he is. Edmond Dantes, main character of the movie along his friend Fernand Mondego, a shipping representative, bring their Captain ashore as captain is injured but Napoleon's British captors catch them. After listening their problem Napoleon spares them and hosts them. He gives a letter to Edmond to deliver it to a person of their homeland by assuring that the letter is harmless to anyone, by giving his words. Edmond is seen by his friend Fernand but he keeps this as secret and lies him about letter, Fernand is jealous of his friend Edmond. After reaching their home Edmond is made Captain and the person due who they get themselves in trouble, Danglers, is demoted. On the other hand Fernand loving fiancée of Edmond, gets his mind poisoned against Edmond. Later he along with Danglers plot against Edmond and conspiring a treason case against him, by indulging Magistrate Villfort whose father is the person to whom letter concerns, by saving magistrate's back and capturing Edmond to a remote prison of Chatea Dlf. There he is continuously tortured by the Jailors. After some time he meets a priest named Faria who was sentenced there as not telling about the treasures to Napoleon. Now, Edmond along with priest struggles to dig some way to come out of that prison. Priest at the same time trains him with some basic Sciences like physics, economics and Warfare tactics. He remains there for thirteen years and after this he escapes by mistaken corps of the Priest who dies.. Edmond, in prison comes to know about the Treasure of Monte Cristo (A land of France) by the information of Priest Faria. So, Edmond gets that treasure by help of a smuggler, who owes his life to Edmond as his act of kindness earlier. Edmond after discovering the treasure becomes the Count (A high rank person in Europe) of Monte Cristo. After escaping Edmond comes to know that his best friend is a deceiver and becomes Count of Paris and is got married with his fiancée, Mercedes and they have a Son named Albert. Edmond, by help of Smuggler, kidnaps Albert and saves him dramatically, later inviting him with his family. His friend Frnand is unable to recognize him but his fiancée, now wife of his friend recognizes him, But Edmond denies, After this Edmond plots against those who are responsible for keeping him in darks; like Villfort, Danglers and at the end Fernands. They are easily dodged and are punished eventually. He takes his revenge from every person and at the end from his friend Fernand. At the end of Movie, Edmond, Albert and his former Fiancée are seen delighted and they start living a happier life. Character of Edmond shows that how innocent one is, he must recognize his kith and kin so clearly. Overall his character shows his strong perseverance and solid believe in God, How he remains in dark cell for thirteen years and how he comes out of this hell and how becomes richest of Paris. Priest Faria, a good teacher for Edmond, tells him ways to tackle the hurdles of life. Fernands a selfish person, loving Edmond's Fiancée, and in her love, plots against him, at the end dies from hands of Edmond. Vilfort, the Magistrate, who makes a case against Edmond, at the end is also imprisoned. Mercedes, former fiancée, a beautiful girl, loving Edmond but later due difficulties faced marries Fernands, but she never lets go Edmond from her memories. They are the main characters of the movie. Movie is all about the hope that never ends and always sustains in seclusion. Movie exposes a lesson that, innocence and blind belief sometimes prove to be dangerous and enough to engulf the neck of life. The master lesson of the movie is that the circumstances change with just a blink of eye, once one is in Paradise and the next moment one observes burning hell. If one is determined and resolute, one can cool the burning hell by turning it into paradise. Another lesson is that the nature always imparts justice. Critically, Movie has some flaws also, It is not clarified; how in an eye blink, and Edmond becomes Count of Monte Cristo. How his enemies are easily trapped in his plot, this question is not justified by the movie, and how his Enemies cannot recognize him. But the overall analysis of movie show that these flaws are not so questionable. Movie is fabulous and interesting in this sense that one can may get precious lessons from the movie. As the novel of the same title is present but this movie can give one really a magnificent experience in a short time. One can easily come to know the events and history, moreover culture of that Era.",The Count of Monte Cristo
367,evilpopcornguy,Pardon?,2,11 March 2014,"Honestly? This movie makes me scratch my head a bit. What did the directors do for research, look up a 50 word plot synopsis of the book? I fully understand making differences from the book in an adaptation, but it still has to resemble the actual book's story. For example, the book ends with Dantes realizing that his revenge turned him into some sort of monster. In the movie, it ends with him and Mercedes getting together again. Most insultingly, the plots of revenge that Dantes goes through completely destroy the reputations, lives, and families of Villefort, Danglars, and Fernand... in the book. All the intricacies that made the book so compelling are left out. For example, in the movie, the plot to kill Danglars is almost glanced over with him being killed after only a few minutes of barely explaining the plan to kill him.The only thing keeping this from a 1 is that it is a mediocre swashbuckler tale. However, both the author of the book as well as myself see Dantes as a chess-master, a plotter. He knew the weaknesses of his enemies and used them so they would ultimately destroy themselves.If all you're looking for is a thoughtless movie that kills a few hours of your time, then this is probably not the 2/10 i'm giving it. Otherwise, you may as well keep this one on you DVD shelf (ESPECIALLY IF YOU LOVE THE BOOK).",The Count of Monte Cristo

370,Juan80,(Ac)count of Monte Christo,5,7 July 2005,"I think the most important thing in mentioning differences between movie and novel is fact, that we strongly tend to believe in easy and sweet plot's endings not caring about that, that this plot lasts indeed much more than 2 hrs. Maybe you had fallen in love after being imprisoned if it lasted 2,3 yrs. But things change, people change as well human minds, especially when you finally handle the fact, that everything's taking place on such a long time. The point is, this story definitely cannot be depicted in 2hrs movie and it's a little bit annoying for me, that Hollywood has no objections against making the epic, three-parted movie that is based on popular sci-fi novel (LOTR) and makes simultaneously such profanation of real masterpiece of European literature. And why ? Because it doesn't deserve on 3 parts ? Because it runs far from sweet Hollywood stories and ends different as we imagines or figured it out ? Because it is french and a story isn't visually attractive ? If some novel deserves on really careful depicting, The Count of Monte Christo is actually ""The One"". I am aware of fact, that such long story needs to be cut, but for the God's sake, you can't really change the story, because it doesn't suit you culturally, and your producer told you, you have to recreate the original script because people won't accept it. Making an entertainment cannot be a mean purpose in causes, which need to ""write the book again"". Would you liked if ""Romeo and Juliet"" finished with wedding of main characters or Kafka's ""The Revenge"" with clearing Joseph K. from all charges ? Movie cannot pervert the idea of author.

Remember that the movie puts you exactly early 1800's and not a Hollywood flick. The single drawback is the lead female character, ""Mercedes"" of which the attempted actress Dagmara ..... just drives you up the wall with her wispering, mouth full of marbles, what she thinks is projecting dialogue is impossible. You have to get the volume way up to try to understand her. How they avoided dubbing in any good actress's voice onto her's is a mystery. Otherwise, you will be entertained of the first order.

If they changed the characters names and the title, one would hardly recognize them as the same. That being said, I doubt Dumas would want his name put on this adaptation.

375,randymonte,Different from the Book - maybe better?,8,25 January 2006,"The story of Monte Cristo is well known, and even those who have never read the Dumas novel know the basic plot: A man is unfairly and unlawfully imprisoned for many years, escapes and exacts revenge on those who wronged him.Jim Caviezel is great as Dantes / Monte Cristo, and I think every part was cast well. The majestic scenery, the details of the prison and the palaces are all fantastic. The film is a delight to watch.It would be virtually impossible for a film to cover everything in the novel, as the hardcover version of the book is almost 1,500 pages long. The problem readers of classic novels (such as myself) will have is not that certain things are left out, but that some crucial elements of the plot are changed. While the film moves through the plot fairly accurately, some things are different, and some are dramatically altered. I found this a little unsettling, but the more I think about it, the less problems I have with it.The story on the screen seems to be more of a ""Hollywood-ized"" version of the original. It's almost as if the screenwriter decided it would make a better movie if part of the story was altered. Indeed, it does make a fine movie. I think all of us have read novels and said ""I love the story, but I think it would have been better if *this part* turned out more like *this*. This seems to be the method the screenwriter used in writing. Of course, to make things come out differently certain things had to also be altered in the course of the story. This does not make parts of the movie any worse than the novel, it merely makes them different. The changes are incorporated to make a smooth flowing plot line that is easy to follow.I highly recommend the movie. I am on the side that thinks the changes to the plot actually made it a better movie.",The Count of Monte Cristo

And I didn't know the story at all (though I had vague recollections of a children's version I'd seen years ago as I watched).That said, it was a great movie.  It was a couple of hours of escape from reality, but it didn't assume I had the miniscule attention span of a teenager.

True, that the ending was slightly warped (I didn't read the novel - I found out the real ending from a relative)Maybe it was because of the fact that I didn't have any expectations from the show, and therefore my judgment was impartial. Unlike Harry Potter, I had read the books several times before, and was a little disappointed at the way things turned out in the movie.What another user said is true, I guess. The objective of judging a movie is to see how well it managed to captivate the audience, not how well the plot stuck to the original story.I would recommend this movie to all those who haven't read the book, as it is quite a good source of entertainment, and the actors played their parts extremely well. James Caviezel is extremely elegant - both as a naive, illiterate peasant, and as a rich sophisticated count. Guy Pearce on the other hand plays his role so well that he's almost hateable.On the whole, it was good, but I would have preferred it if they didn't rush the ending as they did.

Perhaps the most compelling argument I can make for the movie is that it made me want to go out and read the book.The story is very well-paced.  There are many gentler moments in the film (including some very light lines in some very heavy scenes, which are genuinely played), but it somehow manages to avoid being bogged down in these moments; the film never seems ""slow.""As for acting, both Guy Pearce and James Caviezal turn in excellent performances.  I am becoming more and more impressed with Guy Pearce, who somehow manages to take on any character he wants, from Memento's main character to LA Confidential's Lt.

James Caviezel played a deep, thoughtful, protagonist.  When ""Classic"" novels are adapted to screen, I find they have a tendency to move somewhat slowly.

The movie is not true to the way in which Dantes had his revenge and if you have read the book you will be disappointed to say the least.There are other screen versions which are more worth looking in to.

385,tanman99,An OK movie,4,13 November 2002,"SPOILER:The movie's dialogue was not the best, the action scenes were not thrilling enough, and the end ended way too fast. This movie built up way too much throughout the movie and ended within twenty-five minutes. Throughout the movie (at least in Chateau D'If), the priest tells Edmond not to get revenge for ""vengeance is God's."" Yet he does it anyways. Then at the end he says something like ""Ok, now that I've have my revenge, NOW I'll start using the money for good."" That just doesn't make sense to me. He did the very thing that Priest told him not to, but then all the sudden he can just use the money for good and all if forgiven and all handy dandy? I don't think it's that easy. Another thing that was somewhat strange was Albert. How could he possibly suddenly find out who his father is and be alright with it? He didn't even say anything! You'd think he'd be torn between the father he's known forever and the real father whom he's only known for a couple of days or weeks. Sure he may have been shocked and speechless at first, but he should get a little upset over Mondego getting killed at the end. The parts with Richard Harris were the best, and they were funny and interesting. The parts when Edmond was getting revenge on the one guy in the steam bath and his ""You didn't think I'd make it that easy, would you?"" was really cool. He's so dark.

For example, Mercedes' son ""looks"" more like Edmund Dantes then his supposed father Fernand Mondego. I was hoping I was wrong about this assumption but turned out to be true.

390,pierrotlefou,"pure escapist fun, absorbing and lavish",9,13 January 2002,"Within the first 20 minutes, Kevin Reynolds' The Count of Monte Cristo exhibits all of the finest characteristics of the great adventure film: beautiful women, charismatic leads, deadly intrigue, and gorgeous cinematography.After French sailors Edmund Dantes and Fernand Mondego, seeking medical help for their dying captain, accidentally land on the secret island where exiled and politically-dangerous emperor Napoleon is being held prisoner, they become embroiled in the intrigues of those paving Napoleon's return to power. After accepting to deliver a letter for Napoleon to a friend in Marseilles, naive and unsuspecting Edmund finds himself framed for treason and shipped off to oblivion and life-imprisonment at the notorious Chateau d'If, 18th century France's equivalent of Alcatraz.Leaving behind his beautiful fiance Mercedes and his destitute father, who both believe him dead, Dantes at first curses his fate and falls into despair. But with the help of a fellow inmate he soon begins using his time to educate himself, train himself physically, and prepare for his glorious return and revenge...This only gives a very cursory summary of the first hour or so, but the beauty of this film is all in its finer points--the superb acting, dazzling locales and situations, and thrilling action scenes. Guy Pearce plays Fernand with wonderfully despicable malice, while Jim Caviezel gives the movie its heart as Edmund. In his first starring role, Caviezel shows his abundant charisma and screen presence, making Edmund's remarkable transformation throughout the movie absorbing and entirely believable.The plot is rich with unexpected and delicious twists, and despite the film's modest running time, packs enough action, romance and intrigue to fill an epic. To Reynolds' credit, the film never takes itself too seriously. Subtle humour peppers the script, and the very casting of Luis Guzman as one of the major side characters should be proof enough that this film is simply about having unpretentious fun.

Those who have read Alexandre Dumas's rather large book will agree that this plot has been boiled down to the minor essentials. The book has at least 10 sub-plots and plots all tying into one another. The movie has maybe 2 or 3 of those plots. Very rarely do I find instances where i enjoy the movie more than the book, but this is one such instance. I found the scenery/set very beautiful and the costumes were lovely. The script was witty.

It's a feel good film to the extent that it's designed to make the average moviegoer who's never read the Dumas classic feel good about an attempt at self-education in literary culture, however, this film does no justice to its paper and ink cousin. Watching the film makes one feel as if screenwriter Wolport started writing on page 1 and kept going until he'd met a studio mandated page quota, with no outline, plotline or idea how to string together seemingly unrelated events and occurences. The conclusion of the film is littered with a plethora of unforshadowed twists that are so boorish and uninteresting that I actually laughed out loud. Meanwhile, the dialog is so ridiculous that it's hard to tell if this is the fault of bad writing or bad acting. James Caviezel and Dagmara Dominczyk deliver each of their lines, no matter how short or incidental, with the overdramatic quality of a showstopper monologue. Bad! As there is no character development anywhere in the movie the audience is left emotionless and indifferent to the faux sentimental ramblings that manifest themselves as on-screen bufoonery.

401,lizbert,A Typical Hollywood Oversimplification,2,29 January 2002,"Although this particular version of the story makes for a rousing, swashbuckling movie, ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" bears little, if any, resemblance to Alexandre Dumas' epic novel.In the book, Edmond Dantes takes years to plan his revenge, not weeks or months, and does it in a very calculated, cold-blooded way, weaving an intricate, multi-faceted web in which to snare his enemies. In the movie, Edmond is still a hot-head, even after all those years in the Chateau d'If, and I could not help but feel cheated by his rather slap-dash methods.This movie focused waaaaaaay too much on Edmond's backstory (how he was betrayed and thrown into prison), not on the manner in which he plans and executes his revenge. The secondary characters (and sub-plots) in the movie have been altered completely, or expunged altogether. Was Hollywood worried that its viewers might not be able to keep all the characters straight? Puh-leeze. That's *their* job. I could not help but feel cheated by this outright oversimplication of the story. Over-the-top villains, a rousing swordfight, and a ""happily ever after"" romance might be what Hollywood thinks we want, but I would prefer something more substantial, thank you.All in all, it glossed over the story so much that afterwards I felt as though I'd eaten a bag full of cotton candy; it was sweet, pleasant, but not nearly substantial enough to satisfy.

One added scene I did greatly enjoy was Abbe Faria teaching Dantes combat, which never happened in the book.If you have a few hours to devote to reading over 1,000 pages of occasionally dry (but mostly very interesting) literature with greater character development and many more interesting characters and plot lines, read the book.

404,brendansprunier,A slow burn that never has a dull moment,10,24 November 2020,"The best way I have described this to friends I have shown this movie is this: it is a slow burn, that never has a dull moment. The character development is stellar, the world building is magnificent, the scenes and cinematography are incredible for the time and some still hold up. The characters themselves are played gloriously (For the most part) and the phrasing and dialect in the movie may be off-putting to some, it does however keep to the traditional phrasing in Alexandre Dumas' The Count of Monte Cristo, which for me personally, I respected heavily and it added another layer of charm to the watching experience. The massive amount of cuts from the book to the movie is a little jarring to be perfectly honest, but with the fact that the movie is already over 2 hours long, I believe they pulled off a telling of the story that is as faithful to the source material as they could have done in this day and age without making the film feel as though it was trying at it too hard.The changes to the character Edmond Dantès in terms of intelligence in early arcs , granted a little odd, does not sway my thinking that Jim Caviezel gave fantastic shine to the character, and played the part stunningly. Guy Pearce Also was the perfect man to play the role of the Count Mondego, the boisterous, cocky, egotistical air he held around him whilst also portraying a man ""attempting"" to uphold an atmosphere of class to the outside world. Honestly a fantastic performance overall on his part. But most of all, i believe that Richard Harris was likely the best possible choice for the great priest Abbé Faria. A soft spoken, wise old man perfect for the role he played.The major antagonists are done in excellent fashion, and the narrative was always enticing as it built, and showed the progression of Edmond from illiterate ship-hand, to the elegant Count of Monte Cristo. The resolutions in the movie play out in an honestly extremely satisfying manner, wrapping it all up nicely, and even though they had to cut major corners with the source material to get the story on a 2 hour screen time as I fear that if they did more, it may have begun to lose interest of a good number of people. This movie definitely is not for everybody and not everyone will sing this work of Alexandre Dumas' as much praise as I, but If the concept of the movie interests you in the slightest, I promise you it is one that is well worth the watch and you will not regret the decision of putting this movie on. As well as a fantastic book to read if you like the story.This is legitimately my favorite piece of literature that has ever been produced, so I may be a little biased, but as different as the movie is to the book, it is a perfectly watchable, cohesive, and overall fantastic telling of The Count of Monte Cristo, and I can not sing it high enough praises.

In short, it's just another one of those forgettable movies that is perhaps good to watch, if you haven't been exposed to any other form of this story, but to those who seeks out in quality movies and hate wasting time in watching something forgettable, this movie is not worth the effort or money. It's amusing to know that there's a Japanese animation series with bizarre futuristic sci-fi remake of this story that actually made a way better job is remaking the story into their own.Why? Because in order to cut story short (the book is comparable is size with the complete Lord of the rings series), the decided to use the uttermost basic plot, superminimise the characters, and make their own story. I wouldn't even say this is anywhere close to Alenxendar Dumas' work. No, i don't care if they remake the storyline as long as it's good, this is terrible. You'd expect the story of revenge when, being innocent of any misdeeds, all of the good things in your life has been taken away to be much darker and complex.The revenge plot is lame. It doesn't even compare to the apparent vengeance that should've been build in main dantes. And the acting for dantes is reasonable but terrible when he was supposed to be the count of monte cristo. the count's portrayal in this movie was weak, lame and not even close to dark.And as always, to make it Hollywood-ish, they decided to add some love-making scene and a lot of repetitive sword fighting. which, to me, is just a cheap attempt to please the shallow percentage of audience.And the ending is worst. -=stop reading at this point to avoid ending spoiler=-It's not even believable that after those years of misery everything would end with kiss and make up.

Still, having read the book a number of times and loved it, I eagerly awaited this movie. Unfortunately, I feel strongly that this film misinterprets the title it bears. Though this film is rich in colors, costumes and sets, it employs some of the most over-used plot cliches in film history.  Though plot changes surely are necessary in adapting such a long novel, the chosen devices add a garish soap-opera quality to the swashbuckling drama.  In addition, I feel that the director and the actors themselves do not really know the roles in the story.  While Guy Pearce shows occasional glimmers of charisma, he along with the remainder of the cast falter into one-dimensional projections of good and evil.  Most of the characters in the story are just images -- they serve a role in the plot, but they have no real personalities other than a descriptive tagline that might serve a movie poster. The true disappointment, however, is in the attitude of the film.  Rather than trying to tackle any of the complexities in the book (there were so many), it streamlines the story so much that it only borrows plot elements from the novel.  Its feeble attempt To highlight Monte Cristo's conflict with God misses the point and is entirely laughable.  And the lack of any other depth in the film is just unforgivable given the wealth of the material the filmmakers had to work with. The bottom line, in my opinion, is if you are looking for a grand adventure, go reread the book.",The Count of Monte Cristo

410,farrelljt,Trash,1,25 October 2010,"As a fan of the original novel, I had always avoided this film. However, stuck in a hotel room, and not wanting to watch local cable, I dialed this movie up on netflix. I am fully aware that virtually no novel receives a complete translation to the screen, but this film was a mere shell of the actual story. Whole plot lines were ignored, the time frame compressed seemingly into days (once he becomes the Count) that took years in the novel. The love story is a complete farce, and shadow of its powerful force within the novel. Virtually none of the major plot points retain authenticity beyond someone wrongly imprisoned, who takes revenge upon those who doomed him. To be fair, had I never read the novel, this movie may have been entertaining. The story moves along well, and is fairly well-acted. It just seems that they should never have associated the film with the novel when it bears so little resemblance to the original.",The Count of Monte Cristo

Kept my attention the whole film!,10,25 January 2002,"*** Kind of a spoiler if you don't know the story line *** I haven't read the book, but knew the premise and story line coming into the film.  The movie had just the perfect amount of action, suspense, and humor, and a bit of the love story for the ladies ;)  James Caviezel and Guy Pierce pull off the often hard task of buddies to begin, and enemies throughout the film.  James Caviezel is incredible as the Count of Monte Cristo, and Guy Pierce doesn't steal the show as I was dreading.  I heard a couple people mumbling ""could have been a better movie""... but it can be said about most movies.

I would not change a thing. this is the kind of movie that when you leave the theater you just want to go back to see it again.  Every now and then I turned to my friend and we were like oh, OHHHH.  Revelations arose at ever turn.  The revenge was very sweet.  The themes are great and universal.  You learn to lone Edmond and really hate Fernand.  This movie deserves a lot of prase.  The contrast from the terrible Chateau d'If to the lovely sights of Paris, should a beautiful array of sets and scenery which kept you enthralled in the time of this period piece.  My love of France and the French language only added to the wit and humor of this movie and my genuine love of the story.  The great thing is in the end you are not depressed and have a great love of life. It ends perfectly.  I would love for this movie to be nominated for numerous awards.

Jay Wolpert (screenwriter) must have written this movie based on what he vaguely recollected from what he read of the book in high school.  Events are totally made up, characters are all switched around and left out.. one of the most important characters of the book (Maxmillien) is totally left out of the movie, not even a mention. If you haven't read the book, you will be more likely to enjoy this movie.  If you have read the book, this movie will be a big disappointment.

The cinema photography was beautifully made.... the color and the balance on screen visually is moving. It just looked so  "" LARGER THAN LIFE "".  You really can grow to hate the villains....you felt every emotion the Count felt the complex nature of his feelings to his love...the bitterness of seeing your best friend do as he did...you could almost taste the revenge coming....you could feel the triump of the fortune of wealth he had come into.

The story is, of course, great, because, let's face it, the book wouldn't have survived 200 years to become a movie if the story sucked. The plot is a forgone conclusion for the filmmakers, but the characterization and timing of the movie must be just as good. Let me say that it was!

The plot was so jumbled around in this movie version of the great classic novel, that it bore little resemblance to the book. I'm all for a little creativeness in movies that come from books, but these guys added in so many new little details, and completely changed 90% of the remaining details, not to mention rewriting the ending and that idiotic bit about Albert and his father. That little invention alone completely changes the whole morality of the book. If you've read and enjoyed the Count of Monte Cristo, don't watch the movie expecting anything to be the same but the names. If you've read the book, but didn't like it much, you'll probably love what they've done to it!

Though adaptations due tend to stray from the original, this one was not too far off. The problem with the film is that the characters never stayed true to themselves. A man who is wrongly thrown in prison for many years and vows to seek vengeance would not allow himself to become soft hearted and forgiving, as Edmond Dantes(James Caviezel) eventually does. Fernand Mondego's (Guy Pearce) performance is very strong but it lacks something that makes the audience truly hate an antagonist like it should. The least believable character is Jacopo, played by Luiz Guzman. He is completely missed cast in this part, the film is a history piece and Luiz would seem as if he was playing a part in East LA at present day as a gang banger. Both Abbe Faria (Richard Harris) and Mercedes(Dagmara Dominezyk) carry the film with strong performances. My recommendation is wait for the video and then read the book!",The Count of Monte Cristo

Because if you read it, you will never be able to forgive the authors for making a completely different story. Only the beginning reminds of the original book. Everything else is different and quite boring, I should say, because many movies like that have been made before, but nobody has ever written such a charming, full of adventures book like Alexander Dumas. The movie's story is like a typical Holywood story with a happy ending, though in reality it didn't end in this way. The point of the book was that the count started to live a new life, but here he marries his former girl and it even appears that her son was in fact his son!!! It's absurd!

433,rabbithail,(SPOILERS) ARGH!! I want to rip out my entrails..,1,17 June 2004,"WARNING: While others have made a valid point that all films derived from other works should be considered on its own merits, I am so horribly pained by the deviation from the book that I am completely unable to ever see this film from that perspective. That said, if you enjoyed this film, be warned to take this review with a grain of salt or to stop reading. There are some film spoilers though it's a couple years old now. Mostly book spoilers but the book is quite old and difficult to spoil. =PThis was a complete and utter TRAVESTY. 7.8 stars? ARE YOU PEOPLE DAFT?? This was a total bastardization of every premise and emotion of the original story! Even though a derivative work must take liberties to fit a story to a new medium, this obviously tried and entirely failed to preserve any of the original spirit or depth of Edmond's experience. The film can't even be said to be based on the original story, it's a completely DIFFERENT story!The lighting, cinematography, and pacing carried no emotion, direction, momentum, or coherence. Some scenes were just too dark to even see anything, yet there was no comparable darkness of mood to match the plot. Other scenes where it would have been more appropriate to fit it with the emotion were too well lit. Every actor seemed to be acting in his own fantasy world; there was no interaction between the characters at all. Richard Harris looked like he wanted to die as quickly as possible to escape the horrible movie he'd gotten himself into. And WHAT was with the stupid balloon??Nothing explained how Edmond had spent half of his expected lifetime (all of his best prime adult years) trapped in the Chateau. Nothing conveyed the true bitterness of Edmond seeing the child Mercedes had with Fernand in the book. Nothing properly conveyed the extent of Edmond's rage and cold desire for revenge such as his obsession with torture or his willingness to exact revenge on even the trio's family and children. Nothing conveyed the trio's misdeeds eventually coming back to haunt them and cascading down to pain their families that they honestly loved. And the film doesn't even mention Edmond's struggle to find redemption and happiness after a life lost, such as deciding to save Villefort's children or the girl he attempts to start a new life with (none of whom are even IN the film). Yes, the fact that Edmond does not end up with Mercedes in the end is critical of both of them realizing their lives are irreversibly changed by what's happened (more like the end of Cast Away) and that the film is not even the same story. Was it even mentioned Fernand was Mercedes's cousin and mostly a sniveling coward?The Count of Monte Cristo is my favorite story of all time (surprised?) and after seeing this film tear it to shreds, I promised never to even watch another Jim Caviezel flick if I can help it (I'll admit I broke this for Passion of the Christ though that was mostly just to see an entire film in Aramaic); Caviezel's performance was just horrid. I like Guy Pearce in general, but he was acting in his own world here (I've heard general and specific opinion on the Time Machine remake and I'm scared). The only gem in a sea of crap was Dagmara Dominiczyk. Her performance of Mercedes was not only spot on but thoroughly EXCELLENT.",The Count of Monte Cristo

There are too many changes and too much left out to make the movie come close to the intrigue and action in the book.  Originally, Edmond uses brains to fight, but in the movie this is replaced with mindless sword-fighting.

436,kurtzjd,A Supreme Arrogance,1,22 November 2004,"It is the trap into which the adapters of many classic novels fall: the supreme arrogance of thinking that you can ""improve"" a classic narrative. If Dumas were alive today, he would have demanded that his name be stricken from the title and the title itself removed from the movie. All of the elements of a riveting movie are present in Dumas' novel: intrigue, betrayal, adventure, vengeance, and romance. Unfortunately, Kevin Reynolds used very little of the material in his film version of ""The Count of Monte Cristo"". He kept a majority of the characters: Edmond, Mercedes, Fernand, Albert, and Danglars. However, he carelessly changed their relationships, motives, background, makeup, and plot points to create his own story. As for the plot itself, Reynolds kept only a bare minimum for his purposes: Edmond Dantes was engaged to a beautiful girl, was betrayed by people he thought were his friends, imprisoned injustly by a man looking to protect himself. In prison, he came upon a father figure who on his deathbed gave him the whereabouts of a great treasure. Dantes boldly escapes, is rescued by a pirate ship, and wreaks vengeance upon his enemies.Reynolds incorporates these points in his movie. Almost everything else contained in his movie is a creation of his own mind, not that of Dumas.The movie is entertaining if you can forget it's origin. My only hope is that it might move some viewers to actually read the novel. Therein, they will find a masterwork of depth and resonance. How sad that Reynolds couldn't have trusted that source material enough to bring it to the screen.",The Count of Monte Cristo

Not 5% of the dramatic events in the novel are captured in this movie. Also casting is not all that good. You fail to see the hard determination and the extreme power of the count. Movie is really disappointing. (Specially if you've read the novel) Yeah, its true that many movies made after novels fail to capture the elegance of the original story. But in this movie, they have intentionally deviated from the original plot.On the other hand, 1975 TV movie is very good and very closely follows the original story.

438,danielhoren,This movie shows why Hollywood cannot create anything meaningful,1,12 September 2002,"** This comment has a spoiler**This movie is the worst adaptation of the book possible, since the strong message that the book tried to convey is not only demolished, but contradicted. In the movie the Count manages to deliver revenge and get the girl, thereby concluding that revenge is actually a good thing, which will bring you happiness and joy. However, in the novel the Count finds himself with nothing but a spent life after he gets his revenge (So he should have not wasted his life on it). Besides, the book's story is by far more complex and interesting.The worst thing about this movie is that unlike the widely accepted opinion that those who make these movies are smart, but are simply trying to make movies that the masses will enjoy, it seems like in this case the makers actually didn't understand the book at all (Or were willing to simply destroy the book's entire meaning without any respect for the author's original intent, which is worse)!The moral of this movie?

440,erictucker2000,"this is not ""The Count of Monte Cristo""!",3,19 September 2002,"I was extremely disappointed in this movie.  The main thing was that it was only *very* loosely based on the book -- they changed, removed, or added several very significant plot elements, and changed the nature of some of the characters (like Dantes, who was much more mature and principled in the book).  It's fine if they want to make a movie that was vaguely inspired by the book, but then they shouldn't use the same name! The  screenwriter who explained his ""adaptation of a classic"" on one of the DVD special features says the book didn't have enough action.  The book is an exciting and absorbing read, and it is all the more impressive that it achieves this without very much action.  The adaptation is basically a cop-out -- they gave up on making the movie good in the same manner, and resorted to plain old action like we've seen a million times. On top of this, I think the acting was spotty in places, and the movie just doesn't achieve what it sets out to do.  For example, the aforementioned screenwriter explained why he changed Fernand to be Dantes' best friend instead of someone he just met, by saying that this makes the betrayal all the more outrageous.  This may be true in theory, but we hardly had any time to get used to them as friends, so it didn't have that effect at all.  I just thought of Fernand as evil, and their brief friendship at the beginning faded from mind. It's hard for me to tell what I would have thought without having read the book first -- probably I would have thought it was okay but not great.  But having read the book, I found it enraging, and would discourage anyone else who has read the book from watching it.  I recently watched Lord of the Rings again, and saw how the screenwriters, director, cast, etc., lived and breathed the book for many months, rereading it countless times, etc., to be faithful to Tolkein's intent wherever possible, and to me that sets the standard for adaptations.  In comparison, the screenwriter of Monte Cristo doesn't seem to have cared about the book at all, but rather saw it as a source of a basic idea from which a money-making movie could be derived.",The Count of Monte Cristo

443,mattld6982,When Does Revenge Become Something More?,8,13 July 2009,"Very few movies lately have been able to hold my attention, but I still enjoy watching ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" years after its release. Everyone from the actors to the cameramen to the screenwriter to the producer did a fantastic job making this movie. All the actors give great performances while the sets and costumes are also top notch.The movie begins with Edmond Dantes (James Caviezel) trying to save the life of his captain with the help of his friend Fernand Mondego (Guy Pearce). During this fiasco, Dantes is given a letter to deliver as payment for the use of Napoleon's (Alex Norton) doctor. When they return home, Dantes is smiled upon for his bravery in trying to save the captain's life and made a captain himself. Mondego becomes insanely jealous and betrays his friend using the letter. Dantes is then thrown in prison without trial and ends up meeting an old man named Faria (Richard Harris). Faria teaches Dantes things such as reading, writing, economics and combat in return for his help digging a tunnel to escape. He also gives Dantes a treasure map.Through a twist of fate, an opportunity to escape arises and Dantes makes a few unlikely lifelong friends during this event. He makes his way to the treasure and transforms himself into the Count of Monte Cristo. Then he begins a very elaborate scheme of revenge on his old friend Mondego, who at this time is also a count, and the other conspirators. I use term revenge loosely because I do not know of a word to describe this level of hatred and plotting.In the end, Dantes completes his vision of revenge and regains the love of his life, Mercedes (Dagmara Dominczyk). Everything turns out well and justice is served, but it is easy to see that Dantes is not the same man as in the beginning of the movie. When revenge turned into something more, it also turned Dantes into someone else.",The Count of Monte Cristo

It's definitely in my top 5, i should probably read the book, maybe it was more carefully crafted.I have watched this movie many times, and i just wanted to poke some fun at some of the flaws (little or big) i've taken note of (and if i paid more attention, i may find a few more).Firstly, Napolean hands the letter to Edmond, and Edmond takes it. Then, next cut, Napolean is tucking the letter in to Edmonds' coat pocket as though he had never taken it at all. I think Napolean could have chosen a more strategic spot, to give him the letter, being an emperor and all.I've been wondering why Napolean gives Edmond the letter at all, as somehow M. Clareon is somehow aware before Edmonds arrival that there's a letter coming he should receive. Why didn't the person who told M.Clareon in the first place take the letter? That would have been a little more expedient it seems.In a similar vein, how is it that Villefort has arranged pre-false judgement of Edmond to have him taken to the Château D'Ief? How do those guys in the boat know to be there so quickly? How does the warden Dorleac know Dantes at all? When were the papers drafted up to explain the situation to the warden between Edmond going from Villeforts office to the only boat between there and Château D'Ief? Were there two boats? WHY? :) Ah Hollywood...OK, I'll make one last observation to keep it short. Why, why, WHY??? In all the time in Château D'Ief, between two intelligent men, do neither one of them, digging twelve feet a year, 12 inches a month, 3 inches a week, not consider using option A.) The window where Faria got to see the sky for the first time in 11 years when the depth of the bars in the wall were probably only mere inches and would be a days work, or B. Finish the tunnel that only had mere feet to go towards the wall with the window of the sky and the outer world they were trying to reach? Wrong direction? Yep, that second time around, for sure.Well, it is what it is. I still love the premise of this movie though, it's awesome. I'm sure the book is really good too, i should read it.Pop quiz, how many years did Edmond spend in the Château D'Ief before Faria arrived, how many years did Faria spend in the Château D'Ief before meeting Edmond, how many years was it before Faria died, and how many years did Edmond spend in there total, and how does that make sense?",The Count of Monte Cristo
446,The_Beast,A great movie,9,10 April 2003,Jim Caviezel does an incredible job and the more I see Guy Pearce the more I like him.  This is one of the best adaptations of a great classic novel. Too bad the other movies based on Alexandre Dumas' novels suck.,The Count of Monte Cristo
447,martab,"Awful, very American, stupid ""Adaptation""",1,16 August 2004,"SPOILERS, for those who intend to see the movie...This must be one of the most perverse ""adaptations"" I've ever seen. It is as if the whole movie was filmed the 4th of July. It simply has nothing to do with the book it claims to be based on. It is a different story, based in opposite values, if they are values indeed.For anyone who has read the book (or watch any reasonable adaptation), Monte Cristo is the symbol of the sublime being, someone who believed to be guided by God. Umberto Eco explained it by saying he was one of the first portraits of Nietzsche's Overman. Well, in this movie all this magnificence has been converted to a middle American super-hero, with middle American values. I'm sorry, but there are so many American topics in this movie, and so little from Alexandre Dumas' Count, apart from the name, that it just hurts to see it. Not only because it is a hardly an ""adaptation"", but also because it represents the contrary of the original meaning of the story.Just a few examples of these ""incorporated"" values/topics:here, as in any other Hollywood movie, the good guys are good and the bad guys are very bad. So, they thought necessary to add some battering in the prison. Besides, Fernand is not a common man taking profit of the situation, as in the book, here he has a wicked soul, and so the ""adapters"" decide to show it by making him committing murder and being an unfaithful husband. There is a scene, where Fernand and Monte Cristo fight with their fists, that is ridiculous: where is the gentlemanliness that not only the book, but also the place and time of the story demands? Even the movements of the camera in that moment are offensive: you don't know what movie you're watching, Monte cristo or Rambo 6.One of the worst changes, of course, is to make Albert the son of Monte Cristo, but I understand it was necessary to reach the happy ending, with the nice family reunited. Ridiculous. Of course, the role of God in the book is perverted in this movie. In the original story, God can be good and evil, and Monte Cristo believes to be his hand imparting the Supreme Justice. Any man is subjected to his punishments (even Monte Cristo, as when he discovers that has almost killed Maximilian Morrel fiancée). But in this movie, God is a good one more, always on the side of the good ones of the movie. You see it when Monte Cristo has doubts about Mercedes, and then she speaks of God, and a nice music starts to play.. and he kisses her. Very nice, very banal.This movie is not a bad show: it is a very entertaining, Hollywood story. But I believe it has no right to claim to be based in Dumas' story. Any idea of magnificence, fatality, redemption, all those things that are so subtle shown and so strong felt in the book, are here lost.",The Count of Monte Cristo
448,adducci,extremely disappointing,1,5 October 2003,"Because The Count of Monte Cristo is possibly my favorite book, I was very excited when I saw that not only were they making another movie version, but that this version would also star the wonderful Guy Pearce. Unfortunately the only real connection between the movie and the book was the title. Now, I'm not one to demand that the movie mirror the original literature exactly...that's just not possible, especially with a book like this. However, the movie simply ignored the entire message of Dumas' story by cutting the final scene (although I suppose that was necessary once they decided to eliminate 3 major characters).  In my mind this is inexcusable. Why even tell the story if you're going to controvert the entire point of the book?  Outside of that (major) gripe, not much else in the movie impressed.  The acting was mediocre at best, as were the fight scenes. And the plot and timing seems very forced at some times; some of this is inevitable when converting a book this long into a 100-minute movie, but it certainly could have been done better. So basically, if you haven't read the book you might enjoy the movie to some extent, but if you've read and enjoyed the book then stay away.",The Count of Monte Cristo

I personally like movies that are realistic. Movies that tell a story of something that actually happen or can happen. For some reason you can tell that there are elements of this movie that portray some experience that some person actually lived through. Above all the movie had a message. This movie was very deep as well. Couple of the messages was money cannot buy you love and do not try to make something or someone that does belong to you yours. It will never belong to you.

454,Kinetickev,This film has everything,10,6 April 2006,"This was one of the best films I think I have seen in the past 5 years. The strength of the film is in its depth and the fact the story covers all aspects you could hope for. A classic tale with action, adventure, romance, betrayal, humour and a very intriguing story line.The actors perform amazingly, especially Richard Harris in his role as the priest, very convincing and a joy to watch. The lead role (Jim Cavizel) and the performance of Guy Pearce are also well played and they really help you to emerge yourself in the film and feel for the characters.The story line is exquisite. I believe this film has everything and delivers a multitude of emotions whilst being very in-depth and clever. Alexandre Dumas is an amazing writer and delivers a great story for all.I was 21 when I watched this film and although, on initial inspection, it can appear to appeal only to older viewers, the Count of Monte Cristo has something for everybody and will keep you enthralled from beginning to end which is why I rate it 10 out of 10, a must see movie.",The Count of Monte Cristo
455,driimer,Dumas's excellent novel shattered by Hollywood.,4,11 June 2007,"That exactly I would say about this movie. At least I give it 4 points, for the actors are good and movie itself is not so bad.But still, why would someone want to ruin a novel so great? Why at least mess with the original names? What was wrong with these? And reassigning new jobs and ranks? To everyone who has read the original and values it, it is a true assault.As I said before, it not a bad movie. But when you speak of it as a screen version of magnificent novel, it has no value whatsoever.They could have made a movie based on a novel, made it like it is now and call it ""Prisoner of Château d'If"" or something. I would have known that it may depart from the original novel and yet use some story lines and elements of it. I wouldn't have mind it and wouldn't be here right now whining about this movie. But as I went to see the movie with exact same name as novel, I expected it to keep more to the original masterwork.So, as apart from the novel, it is great movie and I truly recommend it. But if you have not read the book and want to see the movie as a substitute, please, don't. You'll get so very wrong picture. And, if you have read it and want to see screening of the book, you also may be disappointed, for this movie it is not.",The Count of Monte Cristo

I can understand where the filmmakers were coming from, the book was mostly talking and spying, and hunting down ones accusers, there was hardly and action at all, plus it was long. Your average movie goer doesn't want to pay money to see that so they had to reach the lowest common denominator. Its just to bad that most people can't sit through a film that is and hour and a half without someone getting killed right away. The book has all kinds of intrigue.

458,geschreiben,Wish they would follow the damn book and hire good actors...,4,9 June 2012,"It wasn't the worst or totally least-faithful. But really, the book is so well written, and most of the scenes and dialogue could almost be filmed as-is, in French or English. That's how Dumas wrote. I don't know why producers/writers insist on changing so much of the story, not just editing out details, and especially the ending. The imperfect, soulful, almost Mozartian ending Dumas wrote is sort of what this world needs right now- not tidy, but meaningful.Also, there was a super LACK of energy through the whole thing. A pretty-boy swarthy face does not a passionate character make. There are so many wonderful actors out there-even 10 years ago when this was made- some of them will sell-able names even. I don't get anything about why any of these people were cast. It was so boring to watch them muddle through.If you're a die-hard fan you'll be annoyed but maybe just want to watch it to see it. If you've never read it, please do instead of watching this. If you're home in bed sick and really bored, then maybe this would be appropriately slow and cheesy.",The Count of Monte Cristo
459,maelstromwang,two thumbs down,2,16 July 2012,"Absolutely disgusting if you've read the novel. Dumas created a masterpiece in The Count of Monte Cristo, weaving a tapestry of fates and human emotions. This movie sets fire to that weaving and uses the ashes to draw a stick figure.The one question that constantly ran through my head while watching this was ""Did the director even bother reading the book?"" Not exactly what you want the audience thinking... Even the major theme of insatiable revenge is warped; it's turned more into a melodramatic love story than anything else. There's no depth to the actions of the Count in the film, and characters are either mashed into putty or discarded altogether.To anyone looking for an engaging piece of work that dutifully reflects the genius of Dumas' novel, look elsewhere.",The Count of Monte Cristo

Though I have never read Alexandre Dumas's legendary novel, I'd say he would be pretty damn satisfied with this spectacular adaptation.Legendarily good acting on the parts of star actors/actresses such as Caviezel, Pearce, and Dominczyk, combined with one of the most epic tales of revenge ever make this film a perfect combination of romance and revenge.If you've never seen TCMC, please do so as soon as possible.

462,shandasanti,Love It!!!,10,19 November 2012,"Movie Review (The Count of Monte Cristo) SPOILERS!!!!It is sometimes very difficult to choose a movie for a date night. Well, I have the perfect one. The Count of Monte Cristo is a movie with a love story for the romantics and the adventure and revenge for the thrill seeking. One of my all-time favorites; it is truly an epic tale of revenge, love, betrayal, friendships, and justice. This is a lengthy movie at 131 minutes set back in the 1800s but well worth it; you don't even realize you have been sitting there as the story unfolds. The Count of Monte Cristo has a lineup of some great actors who do this film great justice. To name a few of these there is: Jim Caviezel, Guy Pierce, and Richard Harris. Please give this movie a chance; it does have slow times but the scenery alone will get you through that. You have to have some in-depth detail in the characters life to really get the big picture. In the end you will be very glad you stuck through it; the twists and turns are laid out beautifully and it all comes together to give you that ah-hah moment of a great film. With the movies that come out today why not give an older movie a chance. Some older movies are forgotten gems!This movie begins with the back story and the friendship between the three main characters; Dantes (Caviezel), Mondego (Pierce), and Mercedes (Dagmara Dominczyk). Dantes is a simple shipmate who is very good friends with Mondego who is a Count's son. Dantes is in love with Mercedes but they have to wait a few years to marry until Dantes can afford a ring. Mondego is very jealous of how happy they are together and doesn't feel that nobility should want what a peasant has. This is only where the hate, revenge, justice and love story only begin. Dantes is wrongly accused by his best friend Mondego and sent to the prison Château D'if. This is where Dantes training and plan for revenge is so carefully and innately laid out with help from the priest who is also a prisoner. The beginning does start out a little slow but you truly need this information to see where the different characters stand in this film. Once Dantes escapes from the prison the action and his plan for revenge really begins to unfold. You don't suspect half the plots he has planned and everything works out so sweet with irony. Mondego is so unsuspecting of this revenge. He thinks his money and power can protect him from anything. Dantes' true love, Mercedes, marries Mondego shortly after Dantes is taken to the Château D'if. This causes Dantes to possess an incredible amount of hate for her. The writer of this film along with Mercedes (Dominczyk), truly play on the audiences emotions. In the beginning you almost feel the hate for her that Dantes does. You keep asking the same questions as he does, why would you betray him and marry the very man who put him in that horrible prison? Later you find out she was actually pregnant with Dantes' son so she had to marry someone quick or be stamped a whore back in those days. Your emotions are on a roller coaster when it comes to this love story. You can actually see the pain in her face as the new Count of Monte Cristo, formerly Dantes, comes prancing back into her life. She calls him a ghost to haunt her giving great imagery of how she constantly has him on her mind.With some of the slower times throughout the movie you will be caught off guard with the breath taking scenery. This is a great tool that was incorporated in this film that definitely had some time achieving. From the absolute breathtaking ocean views to the hillsides they did not fall short. The plantation homes and properties they show are indescribable. They really get you with the beauty and money they portray in these characters. The lavish homes are constantly filled with parties fit for queens. It puts you in the movie; giving you that exact feeling of how it must have been in those times.Overall, this is a spectacular movie. It remains my favorite to this day. Like I said, this movie includes every genre and aspect so that all movie goers can be happy in one film. So cozy up with your date have the popcorn and tissues ready; he'll be ready for those plot turning bouts of revenge and she will be ready for the romance and love of the story. Definitely a must see even though it is several years old. Sometimes you need a really good feel good type of movie with the movies they come out with today. Sit back, relax and enjoy!",The Count of Monte Cristo
463,katina1-2,Almost Family Friendly--Definitely Worthwhile,9,30 June 2005,"I just watched this movie this week for the first time, and as the conscientious mother of a 14 year-old girl, I was very pleased with its quality, integrity, and presentation. We do not recall so much as one cuss word throughout, the ""love scenes"" were not graphic and were almost within propriety, and the violence was not gratuitous; it simply accomplished its purpose. We were so impressed with Jim Caviezel's performance and were delighted by the scene between him and Richard Harris. It only lasted about 20 minutes, but I could've watched it for another 20 or so at least. Richard Harris was wonderful again--and gave us a sweet, endearing, (and humorous!) change of pace in the movie to help us ""enjoy"" Edmond Dantes' prison term instead of being merely disheartened by it all. There is a real chemistry and magic in the exchange between the two and the movie couldn't have done without it, in my opinion. Personally, I was disappointed with the playwright's changes to the script, but then again . . . they call that artistic license. I also think the movie should have pushed for a 3-hour duration, as some scenes were noticeably ""herded"" right along and I felt the audience was consequently left deficient of the experience they would prefer to have and denied a fuller depth of the characters and story. However, all in all--if you can divorce yourself from the book for a while and take this in as an entertaining movie--it will deliver just that: love, hate,affection, contempt, mystery and suspense, defeat and victory, and finally triumph. I give this movie a 9--based on its presentation, art, taste, talent, and ""cleanliness,""--and had it been longer and had thereby allowed us more ""depth of experience,"" I would have given it a 10.",The Count of Monte Cristo
464,alrija7,Disgrace to the novel.,2,3 April 2019,"Just got worse and worse. I could handle some of the plot changes for screenplay but it just dissolved into something recognizable. The plot is a classic - one that has been echoed time and time again though different movies and TV shows. Why butcher a classic like this? I will chalk it up to the 90's/early 00's habit of revisionism, but am still greatly disappointed with the end result. Reference the 70's(?) version if you want an accurate account of the story. Preferably read the book. Just all made up, BS plot for the last 20 minutes of the movie.I'll give it two stars because some of the plot change early on were original and entertaining.",The Count of Monte Cristo
465,roraly,very disappointing,1,7 August 2005,"I am not really in favour of the idea that a movie should follow entirely the book, but in this case I was expecting at least a similarity. Nothing in this movie reminded me of the great novel of Alexandre Dumas, which was one of my favourites.I don't mind about actors and acting, even though i think the roles were not properly put into scene, but some parts of this movie were ridiculous. The Monte Cristo appearance in society for the first time(in a balloon) was really disgusting, and has nothing to do with his real personality. His relationship with Mercedes, and that they had together a child was also ridiculous, and so was his so called ""friendship"" to Fernand too, who was in fact the catalan friend of Mercedes. None of the characters is strong and well defined like in the book, Monte Cristo does not give in here any sign of mystery and strength. The revenge scene in the final is brutal and has nothing to do with his personality. I believe this character was really bad understood. As far as I remember the count didn't kill anyone, he choose a more subtle and smart way to do this. And of course, the ""happy"" ending that he stays with Mercedes and ""their"" son made me sick. He is more complex than a simple Hollywood character.At least, the movie shouldn't have been intitled like that. Is a real Disappointment for Alexandre Dumas fans.",The Count of Monte Cristo
466,jakemarugg-52,Good until about half way through...,3,23 June 2013,"I'll begin by saying that I am a huge fan of the book by Alexander Dumas, and my love for the story, it's characters, and style is what prompted me to watch this film. That said, perhaps it is my love of the book which spoiled the film, as they two bare little resemblance after the first half of the movie.To start, this film feels cheap, but passionate. After the first few minutes you get the idea that the producers are trying very hard to suck you into the story, and are passionate about the characters they have been tasked to portray. And I must say, they do a good job. I found myself fascinated by Edmond and his growing predicament. I felt his joy when he was about to become captain, and be married to Mercedes, and I got a good sense of his pain and loss when he was thrown into prison and tortured; just as I had when I read the book. Even if it was a cheap film, I liked it. A lot.Until....Pinning down the exact point at which the film went wrong is difficult for me. As Dontes emerges from prison I was greeted by a different picture than what was in the source material. Immediately characters were out of place, situations changed, and entire intrigues and subplots dropped. I was, needless to say, disappointed. However, I disregarded my feelings at this point, reminding myself that the book is stupefyingly long and probably wouldn't work well on film if shot in entirety. This excuse doesn't last, however.As we preceded further things got even more entangled and misplaced. I began to feel betrayed, in all honesty. The filmmakers had started by making me think they were going to stay faithful to the source material. However, by the time I was two thirds in, almost all fidelity to the source material had vanished, and I was left with a sloppy mess of dramatic characters playing out scenes that didn't even exist, weren't supposed to exist, and didn't exist for a reason in the original source material. By the time the credits came I was raging at my TV. Perhaps my love of Dumas and his book got the best of me, but I don't think so. I tried to evaluate this movie as a standalone film, as I often do in book-to-movie scenarios. But when I did that, all that was left was a story about a man who gets wrongly imprisoned, escapes, gets rich, throws his rivals in prison, has sex with his long-lost girlfriend, and then kills someone. Sounds more like a gangster movie to me.I give this film 3 out of 10, only giving three points because the first half was good, and they really tried, but ultimately the producers bit off more than they could chew.",The Count of Monte Cristo

It strikes me sometimes that in most of today's movies, we see God's name used in vain, and unfortunately things get worse to the extent of seeing the main character in the movie, which is usually admired or supposed to be admired by the audience, mocking God Himself. So it is indeed very refreshing and reassuring to see a movie produced in 2002 with many good things to say about God. This movie also has so many good messages to deliver. It is definitely worth watching, and worth its time.

The first time I watched it, I will admit to falling asleep next to my husband. But it got me through a stressful time of my life. I bought it and sat through the director's commentary. He said he had to keep it pg so there was no explicit sex scene. Hitchcock said it best. It's not what we see but what is left to the imagination. When he was making his television show, he knew exactly when to cut. When you watch them on DVD, it is not the same.You see the despair on Edmond played so well by Jim Caviezel, and then you cut to their kiss. The scene after that shows that the love never died. After their tryst, you see a strength in her that reinforces your belief in love.Richard Harris has a number of lines where he is teaching Dantes and the way he enters his cell is really using his head.

The only saving grace of the film is the sets, costumes, and scenery. Actually, I should add, the plot, reworked to fit a 2 hr film is palatable. Basically the downfall of this movie are the lead actors. Caveziel - what blind and deaf person cast this guy? He has the charisma of that teacher in Ferris Bueller's Day Off who intones, Bueller? Bueller? He is so flat, so horrid, so unappealing, so boring, casting him as the lead character doomed this movie to failure. (And why does he have that perpetual 'whipped' look on his face that the Count of Monte Cristo would NOT have?????) I have always been underwhelmed by Guy Pearce's performances but I will admit that he displays the one sign of life in this dreadfully droll piece. Mercedes! She is a most tragic and imo, one of the most interesting characters in Dumas' novel. Like Caveziel, the actress, and I use that term very loosely, simply sucks the life out of the character, although, to be fair, the character is simply a plot point in the movie. Jacopo - simply bad, bad, and bad. The character is comical and I do not say that in a good way.

Luis Guzmán and Dagmara Dominczyk are woeful. the easy points that are there to be scored with the archetypal villain that is Danglars in the original are passed over along-with the presence of Noirtier (curiously renamed Clarion???). How anyone could under-use the talents of Richard Harris so criminally escapes me.... i'm sure it wouldn't be so bad if you hadn't read the book, but even then it's not really worth an evenings viewing when you could hire a real swashbuckling movie like Pirates of the Caribbean, any of the Sinbad movies or even the Goonies.i'm not sure how you can go so wrong with such goldmine to work from....",The Count of Monte Cristo

The actual story begins when the Pharaon arrives in the harbor at Marseille (in broad daylight!) with Morrel, the ship's owner, rowing towards it. Save yourself from watching this awful, horrible adaptation or rather, parody, of the Count of Monte Cristo by reading Dumas's original chef d'oeuvre.",The Count of Monte Cristo
474,ambrosebierce,A so-so film...,1,26 September 2005,"This film is absolutely unlike the book which I read and loved. It is just typical Hollywood drivel and contains nothing of the complexity of the novel.And absolutely worst of all the movie tampered with the ending to make a nice happy American ending when the book's ending was so much better and so much more believable.In the book Dante's having to let Mercedes go allows his character to develop more and it is much more realistic than the crap the screenwriters come up with such as him and Mercedes having a child.I could list a few pages of how different this movie is from the book.It's like the writers read the book, jotted down a few points and names...threw the book in the trash and wrote their own story",The Count of Monte Cristo

The story has been butchered in the worst possible ways, including miscasting and mediocre acting. It is not even worth watching if you are a fan of the novel by the same name.A scene with a hot air balloon, 4 women sliding down ropes, announcing the arrival of the Count was preposterous. Other ridiculous scenes include his servant (in the book he is a mute Nubian), which is a Hispanic right out of Puerto Rico.The end is also confusing. In a word, this story is wrong on so many levels, it is no wonder it cost $35 million and grossed $54 million, hardly enough to pay the cast and support staff.",The Count of Monte Cristo
477,zohawamiq,overall a great movie to watch.,8,6 May 2016,"The Count of Monte Cristo is a tale of deception and revenge which is carried out on the big screen and it was first released in 1934. After 68 years a director named Kevin Reynolds decided to do a remake which he released in 2002. It's a piece of old fashioned ambiguous entertainment. It is rated PG-13 because it has several violent scenes and a moment of implicit sexuality. This movie has its melodramatic aspect and sufficient humor that makes it hard to resist. A lot of universal and fundamental ideas of life such as personal growth, relationships, happiness, success, wealth, perspective, mysteries and finally freedom and liberty are also demonstrated in this gold-aged, adventurous movie. The movie stars Jim Caviezel as Edmond Dantes who is an honest man, very humble and blessed with good looks, good fortune and the love of the beautiful fiancé Mercedes played by Dagmara Dominczyk. Edmond's happiness and satisfaction infuriates his evil, well-bred friend Fernand DE Mondego (Guy Pearce), who is the main antagonist of the film. The conflict between these two characters leads Edmond in trouble, but later he gets himself out of it. The Count of Monte Cristo definitely has its pros and cons. Now starting off with the cons, it's one of those movies where it's going right at first but everything turns around in an instant to the point where one is not even expecting that to happen. Even though most movies have that instant turning around feature, to me it's a clique. Probably the biggest con would be how the time line of this movie is very unclear at times. For a number of scenes, it is hard to tell whether it has been days, months or years that had passed since the last time a given character had been on screen. The movie feels a bit drawn out at times but the graceful action scenes and the music in the background somewhat holds the audience's attention and keeps them on the edge of their seats which saves this movie from being too unfavorable. As for the pros, this movie is filled with amazing actors/actresses and serves as a great entertainment with its colorful cast, numerous plots, beautiful costumes, accessories and the music that truly makes up the movie. First, Richard Harris gives a legendary performance and is absolutely hilarious at times even though there is no spot for comedy here. Still, he manages to entertain us at these moments. Jim Caviezel who plays the male lead, gives off his usual and charming performance to make a stunning display in the movie. Finally, Guy Pearce who is probably the best-acting actor in the movie in terms really sinks into his role and character. His delivery of his duologue's and emotions throughout the film captures the audience's attention, even though he is playing a supporting role. The casting for this movie is truly perfect, and the actors do not disappoint whatsoever. The fast-paced nature of the film and the added romantic aspects truly makes this movie one of the great ones. Another thing it may do on a personal note for some of the audiences members, are bring back some old memories. Some joyful and nostalgic moments appear when you get to see those vintage telephones in the movie with the very exciting rotary dial feature. Since these no longer exist, it may bring back memories for the older viewers of the movie. All movies have their pros and cons and so does this one. I would say however, the pros outweigh the cons. As for watching the movie, this movie cannot be watched for a pick me up or in order to laugh hysterically but it's definitely a movie one should watch. Despite its minor shortcomings and fogginess, the count of Monte Cristo is still a great movie with excitement, creativity and is fun to watch.",The Count of Monte Cristo

The book was far too slow and had so many unnecessary characters and other details in it that I felt just made it boring as hell for the most part, but the story of the count of monte cristo itself is really good. I had read the reviews for the movie and seen the trailer so I was expecting this to be really good.It was wrong though, don't get me wrong the movie does bring a lot of the boring descriptions to the screen in seconds as you'd expect it to and adds its own take for the ending which was better than the book. But, it was far too rushed for gods sake! Obviously there's only so much you can fit into a couple of hours in a movie and does make this exceptionally hard in the count of monte cristo's sake considering how long the book is. I think it should have been at the very least a 2 part movie or even a trilogy or even just cut out a lot of the original story and made it's own version from it.

483,barryween21,WWDD: What Would Dumas Do?,1,30 November 2005,"As a huge Dumas fan and having read the book numerous times, I find it truly appalling that they could first make this movie, and second put Dumas' name on it. It is so incredibly unfaithful to the book it is ridiculous. If you've seen this movie and think that it is in the least a decent revenge film, you really need to look up revenge in a dictionary and then go read the book. The gross differences between the movies and the book that make the book infinitely better: 1) In the book, Dantes brings down Fernand and Villefort by discovering subsequent crimes they committed, and effecting that these crimes come to light, destroying them in public. 2) He never lays a hand on Danglars, and spares his life, just ruins him financially. 3) He does not kill Fernand in a swordfight--Fernand commits suicide. 4) He has no son by Mercedes, and does not get back together with her as in the maudlin finish in this movie. 5) In the book, he not only brings down the 4 people who did him in (one of whom is left out of the movie entirely), but helps a number of people (mainly children of both villains and good people) whose lives are being destroyed by his own nemeses, so he is doling out both good to good people, and deserved exposure of bad people--the part about helping the good people is completely expunged from the movie. 6) Lastly, so many characters, plot nuances, and character development are left out of the movie. In the book, the true genius of Dantes comes out in how brilliant the retribution is. If they were going to make a flashy Hollywood revenge movie with using the timeless wrongfully imprisoned, escaped, seeks revenge plot that Dumas mastered, that's fine, but don't tarnish this travesty with Dumas's name or even call it The Count of Monte Cristo.Don't waste your time.Dumas would die of shock if he saw this.",The Count of Monte Cristo
484,Rudesnowfoe,I Didn't Know....,9,18 October 2005,"Before I went to go see the ""Count of Monte Cristo,"" I had an idea of the basis of the movie...a revenge kind of movie, with a love story tied in, and there would be a hero, and someone evil. I figured I would wait until it came out on video to actually see it, instead of paying good money on a basic action flick. Bad mistake. I waited until it came out on video, regretfully, I should've seen it on the big screen based on the fun level of the movie. I kind of expected a lot of the twists in the movie, but the actors and actresses portrayed more than just plain vanilla characters. It made me fall in love with the heroes wife, and how she was so devoted to our hero, and how the whole story unfolded into his revenge plot against his former best friend and other people who wronged him came about in one good happy feeling ending. The characters are the ones who truly made this movie hit you in the heart, and really feel for these people in the movie. And in the end, you can't wait for our hero to finally get all he deserves in the final scene, as he stands with all he ever wanted on the place he was imprisoned, a happy man.",The Count of Monte Cristo

After all, if the producers hadn't used the book's name to lure the crowds into the theaters, I may have thought of this as a relaxing, accessible, superficial flick.And I am not one to say that I was expecting a perfect adaptation - after all, it *is* an ample, complex book that could probably never be perfectly transposed to film...But when I saw this movie in the theater, the only thing I could think of was how much the plot line was changed - in a bad way. It almost makes one think of Edmond Dantes as a playboy and a murderer, and of Mercedes as a femme légère... and the entire story is transformed according to the screenwriter's wishful thinking.To sum up, it basically kills the whole IDEA of Dumas's masterpiece and robs it of all its depth, in favor of a very Hollywood style.

First of all because it was wrote by Alexandre Dumas( The best writer I ever saw ), secondly it was so extraordinary that I thought it was the most beautiful dream.Once a decade a movie is made after a book that changed the life of all humanity... and these movie is ""The Count of Monte Cristo"". It is well noun that ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" by Al. Dumas has had over then 20 movie productions from 1920-2002, but these one was the greatest of all. The film wasn't made after the original script of Al. Dumas but the producer made a beautiful scenario that is, for this film only, perfect(despite of the fact I sad early). The actors that played in the movie had a roll too in making from this great movie an excellent one. They had the strength and psychical power of all Al.

487,kcombs-2,One of the worst movies I have seen,1,30 November 2005,"This film was an unfortunate waste of time and money. As an English teacher that teaches the classics, including The Count of Monte Cristo,I was amazed to find few similarities between the novel and this film, and these similarities were questionable at best. The vengeful plot of the Count is a beautifully woven, romanticized, psychological, thriller. After Dantes is wrongfully imprisoned on the Château d'If, he plans to take vengeance on the men who were responsible for destroying his life. These men were Danglars, Villefort,and Fernand--who was not a friend of Dantes, but the man who took away his love. Because of these men Dantes lost everything that was dear to him, including the women he loved, Mercedes--who was not pregnant by Dantes and who waited 18 months before she married her cousin. It was from the pressure of prison that Dantes carefully calculated the methods he would use to get his revenge. He wanted it to be a slow and painful suffering--because a quick death was too good for these men. None of this tension is evident in the film. The film bastardized a novel that was full of tension and suspense, which keeps readers wanting to find out what happens next. This was Hollywoods way of chasing the almighty buck. This film did little to make me or my students want to watch it. My juniors and seniors, who are not always focused on reading, are thoroughly engaged in the novel because of Dumas' masterful writing. Several students have seen the film and have made the same comment I have made--this is film for people who have never read the book. So, stay out of the video store, save your money, grab the book out of the library,sit down and let Alexandre Dumas take you on a thrilling adventure that will keep you turning the pages.",The Count of Monte Cristo

I didn't find Monte Cristo's vengeance at all the wily and cunning type, as it is in the original plot. And this Italian 'macho' Jacoppo goes on calling him 'Zatarra, Zatarra...'. Annoying... Anyone who's seen the French TV minis must admire the cunning and loyal Bertuccio. The movie also deviates too much from the original storyline... I am not saying directors aren't allowed to make improvisations on the storyline, but this movie... well, rather than sticking to the well-developed original plot, it goes into dramatic backdrops.. things like that...

This tale contains betrayal, patience, and finally the sweetest of revenge. Although some changes have been made from the book to the movie, the classic remains intact on all the heavy issues. Jim Caviezal (High Crimes, The Passion of the Christ) is brilliant as the innocent Edmund Dantes, who transforms himself via training and luck into the grandiose figure of the Count of Monte Cristo. Guy Pearce (Memento, LA Confidential, The Time Machine)plays the cold-blooded character, Fernand Mondego, to perfection. An ensemble cast of Richard Harris, Luis Guzman, James Frain, and many others contribute to the masterful motion picture. Historical non-fiction is what Dumas' writings often were coined, and this story bares no exception as allusions to Napoleon and early nineteenth century France are ample.

Someone must of sent Photoshop, a computer, and a nice printer back in time.James Caviezel and Dagmara Dominczyk did a credible job of playing their roles, but I can't say as much for any other actors. Some of the settings were appropriate and well made. That's about all this movie has going for it.Not only was the dialog bad, but the plot was unbelievable. The movie kept jumping from one moment to the next, without any type of continuality.I find it very ironic that the average rating was 7.5 here. I'm very easy to entertain and normally don't pick apart movies. Trust me, this is an exception. However, it might be fun to have a get together to laugh at this one. So, if you're in the mood for a movie you can laugh at (even though it's not a comedy) and say ""I could of made a better movie, and I don't know how to make a movie!"", pick this one up.I should note that I finished the book a couple of days ago.
