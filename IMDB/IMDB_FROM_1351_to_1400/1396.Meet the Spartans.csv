0,MartinHafer,"Well, at least it's not as bad as ""Disaster Movie""!",2,16 January 2010,"As this film begins, you see an ancient Greek guy inspecting babies. One is a baby Shrek and the puppet looked 100% plastic and stupid--and then began spewing green slime. And so begins this pile of manure. Soon, eating canned dog food, killer penguins (which crap on the leading man), laughing at the death of Anna Nicole Smith and the like follow in this dreadful film. It's obvious that this is going to be a very, very long movie.Like ""Disaster Movie"", ""Superhero Movie"" and 1001 other iterations, this movie was simply dreadful. While not quite as horrible as ""Disaster Movie"", this is like saying that Ebola isn't quite as bad as and the Pneumonic Plague--neither one is particularly nice! Why anyone would pay for such a dreadful experience is beyond me.So why is this movie so bad? Well, it's obvious that the movie was made cheaply and the film makers didn't care if most people would never go see this film. All you needed, in their opinion, was an ample supply of stupid teenagers with money! And, apparently, there are LOTS of stupid and gullible teens out there! So, with such love expectations, why bother with decent writing or acting?! And, again because you are appealing to the lowest common denominator, why not fill it with cursing, spitting, fart and wiener jokes?! It's not like it takes a lot of talent or imagination to employ this sort of humor. Only a few times did I laugh...but this was awfully rare.Most of the suggestions I made for ""Disaster Movie"" would also apply to this film and I don't want to repeat them again. Still, I'll try to recap the important points. Try to parody less films and put quality into the ones you do parody. Get writers who are not idiots or squirrels. Avoid wiener, spit or poop humor. And finally, maybe just stop making these type of films. ""Airplane"" and ""Hot Shots"" were good films as were their sequels. Otherwise, it probably would have been best to quit making goofy parody movies then instead of bleeding a totally dead franchise for yet another dreadful so-called comedy.By the way, I just noticed that star of this film Carmen Electra and Hitler share the same birthday. Coincidence? I think not!",Meet the Spartans
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Not as bad as Disaster Movie, but still a very,very poor film",2,23 February 2010,"I don't take pleasure in criticising Friedberg and Seltzer's spoof movies, but I do seriously dislike them. Not only are they not funny or irrelevant but they are a complete waste of time. Meet the Spartans is not as abysmal as Disaster Movie, which is by far and away the worst of their spoof movies and quite possibly the worst spoof movie ever. However, that is not saying much, for it is a very poor movie, junk-food cinema at its worst some people have described it. The film is very poorly made, with very slapdash camera work and fake looking sets. I personally thought some of the costumes were nice and the soundtrack was tolerable. Asides from the scenery and the in general cheap look of the film, other failures are in the jokes and in the acting. The acting to say the least was atrocious with Kevin Sorbo and Sean Maguire playing themselves and Carmen Electra simply dreadful as Queen Margo. The jokes, what happened to them? Constant homophobic jokes about men in codpieces and scatter shot send ups of contemporary pop culture, they were close to offensive rather than funny and you really do get the sense you've seen it all before. Plus the plot line was almost non-existent. Overall, I didn't hate Meet the Spartans as much as Disaster Movie(or Epic Dud...excuse me, Epic Movie for that matter) but it is for me a poor film. 2/10 Bethany Cox",Meet the Spartans
2,Sleepin_Dragon,Terrible movie.,1,6 February 2018,"If you think Epic Movie was bad, then try watching this one! The blame rests fully with the writing team, it is just dire, you almost have to feel sorry for the performers, as they try their best, but are totally up against it.Carmen Electra tries her, best, she looks great, but she has wrecked any credibility she had by doing too many of these poor films. The only surprise to come out of this film was to see how buff that guy from Eastenders had become. Sean Maguire looks in incredible shape, but sadly for him, this was a disaster role.I think even adolescent teens would find this brand of toilet humour an embarrassment, and simply not funny.Awful.",Meet the Spartans
3,jboothmillard,Meet the Spartans,1,25 September 2008,"300 was a fantastic film, and from two of the makers of the Scary Movies, Date Movie, Epic Movie and Disaster Movie, comes this extremely disappointing spoof film. The 300 story isn't changed much, Leonidas (Sean Maguire) grew to be a warrior, goes to war with the Persians, led by Xerxes (Borat's Ken Davitian), Queen Margo (Razzie nominated Carmen Electra) runs the Sparta kingdom in Leonidas's absence, and after many battles in the end they lose. Added into the story are a Hunchbacked Paris Hilton (Nicole Parker), plus spoofs of other recent film, adverts and celebrities, including American Idol, America's Next Top Model, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas video game, Deal or No Deal, Ugly Betty, Casino Royale, Happy Feet, Rocky Balboa, Ghost Rider, Spider-Man 3, Shrek the Third and Transformers. Also starring Hercules: The Incredible Journeys' star Kevin Sorbo as Captain, Diedrich Bader as Traitoro, Method Man as Persian Emissary, Jareb Dauplaise as Dilio, Travis Van Winkle as Sonio, Phil Morris as Messenger, Jim Piddock as Simon Cowell Look-a-Like, Nicole Parker as Paula Abdul Look-a-Like/Britney Spears Look-a-Like/Ellen DeGeneres Look-a-Like, Crista Flanagan as Ugly Betty Look-a-Like, Emily Wilson as Lindsay Lohan Look-a-Like, Thomas McKenna as Tom Cruise Look-a-Like, John Di Domenico as Donald Trump Look-a-Like, Christopher Lett as Randy Look-a-Like, Ryan Fraley as Brad Pitt Look-a-Like, Tiffany Claus as Angelina Jolie Look-a-Like, Jim Nieb as President Bush Look-a-Like and Dean Cochran as Rocky Balboa/Rambo. Only two tiny, tiny bits made me giggle, the rest of it I just sat through, no laughing and very little expression or reaction. Some of the spoofs are really random, the jokes get really repetitive (people falling in the Death Pit, Spartan break dancing), the jokes are really cheap, easy to make and quite obvious, I got the feeling I'd seen a film like this before, and I have, it's almost exactly the same as something like Scary Movie 4, and it sucks balls! It was nominated the Razzies for Worst Picture, Worst Director for Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer; Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-Off or Sequel and Worst Screenplay. Very, very poor!",Meet the Spartans
4,ma-cortes,"Absurd spoof plenty of silly jokes, embarrassment comedy , bad taste and lunatic humor",3,9 November 2009,"This is a lousy spoof based on the famous film directed by Zack Snyder and based on sensational Frank Miller's comic book. This slapdash movie packs a nonstop string of rough gags that holds up almost to the ending. It's full of fart jokes, bad taste, kinky sex, really lame scenes, and foul-mouthed language spliced in whole film . Here are badly brought to life the heroics deeds about battle of Thermopylae, the only trail to arrive Athens . The events(480 B.C) are ridiculously developed, these are the following : King Leonidas (Sean MacGuire in the role of Gerard Butler) seeks advise to oracle(Christina Flanagan become into Ugly Betty)and establishes an alliance with Greeks polis facing the invading Persian army. Leonidas leaves his wife Queen (Carmen Electra in similar role of Lena Headey) and son , leading a small army formed by a captain(Kevin Sorbo in the character of Vincent Regan), accompanied by his son (Travis Van Winkle : Tom Wisdom look-a-like), and several others. The army called Falange is constituted by various Spartans named Hoplitas wielding the shield Heplon and long lances . The almost 300 hold off an immense Persian army commanded by king Xerxes(Ken Davitian in the role of Rodrigo Santoro). Meantime in Sparta are happening intrigues surrounding the Greek council whose protagonists are the Queen Margo, and Traitor( Diedrich Bader in similar role to Dominic West) . A hunchbacked wanna-be warrior woman (Nicole Parker, a Paris Hilton look-a-like, in similar character to Andrew Tiernan), informed Persians of a hidden way that could utilize to besiege the Spartans.From the start to the ending the coarse humor and the laughters are innumerable. Lots of gags and sketch, some of them funny but the movie lacks freshness. This is a hilarious parody,surrealist,extreme spoof and gross-out . As always the cinematographic references are numerous and provide silly laughs from start to finish,the amusement is guess what films result to be as Skull Rider, Rocky ,Borat, and TV contests . The picture contains loads of silly fun here and there and a passel of cameo appearances . Stay tuned through final credits with the cast singing and dancing . The film produced by Arnon Milchan is awfully directed by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. The motion picture will appeal to vulgar humor enthusiasts and stupid comedy buffs. Rating : Bottom of barrel , a real turkey.",Meet the Spartans
5,paul_haakonsen,And then the Spartans danced...,6,9 June 2018,"This spoof was based mostly on ""300"", although there were some other references throughout the movie.There was a good amount of laughs actually to be had here, as well as some rather hilarious scenes.I will say that they actually had good props and costumes for the movie, which really helped lift up the movie to a different level of enjoyment. There are lots and lots of spoofs out there, and not all of them can pull a spoof off quite as well as ""Meet the Spartans"" did.And the cast were doing good jobs with their given roles. There were some nice talents to the cast list, most of which I hadn't seen before. But it was Kevin Sorbo, after all, that was the pulling point of the movie and he did carry it quite well.If you enjoy these spoof type of movies then ""Meet the Spartans"" is definitely one that is quite well watching.",Meet the Spartans
6,tavm,Meet the Spartans was a pretty decent time-waster for me,6,31 January 2008,"Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, the writer-directors of last years' mostly unfunny spoof Epic Movie, serve the same position on Meet the Spartans. Now, while I thought EM went all over the place in taking every pop culture item without any consistency in characterization and therefore made no sense whatsoever, I actually thought MTS stayed close to its source (300) and only went slightly overboard in going on other tangents (this time on reality programs like ""American Idol"", ""America's Next Top Model"", ""Dancing with the Stars"", and ""Deal or No Deal""). Besides, I actually thought much of the material here was funnier than EM. Maybe I'm in a better mood than I was last year when I saw EM with a friend and his then 13-year-old nephew and his best friend with some worry about certain scenes being seen by them. Here, at least I know what to expect and its only with the friend. So in summary, I laughed at most of the pop culture references and many of the scandals that happened in the previous year (Paris Hilton, Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan). And many of the bad taste homosexual jokes were funny both to me and my gay friend. So if you feel like wasting a couple of hours just for fun, Meet the Spartans should do the trick if you don't feel like seeing the latest Oscar-nominated film.",Meet the Spartans
7,Theo Robertson,Yes It's Rubbish But Is It The Worst Film You've Ever Seen ?,3,11 December 2010,"This is one of these films that is considered to be one of the worst in the history of cinema . It's certainly rubbish but is it really a contender for worst film ever made ? What is suffers from is that it's a sketch show premise stretched out to feature length premise and since there's only two targets , the movie 300 and the cult of celebrity , the premise is stretched way beyond breaking point , especially since the writers and directors Friedberg and Seltzer only see 300 as a foundation to hang gay jokes upon . The Spartans were gay so we get gag after unsubtle gag involving both blatant and latent homosexuality . In fact the jokes are so inoffensive no matter how crude they are that you'd think they were written by Hilary Clinton The other failing is that we're shown umpteen parodies of celebrities but you're totally puzzled as to who they're supposed to be . I thought one of the celebs was Chris Hansen but apparently it was a presenter from American Idol , one celebrity mentions Scientology and it was only then I realised it was meant to be Tom Cruise ( or was it John Travolta ? ) and we see "" Simon Cowell "" who'd have a hard time convincing Stevie Wonder it's Simon Cowell > Maybe MST would have worked better on radio than the silver screen ? Yes MST is absolute rubbish but I hasten to add that it's maybe not the worst comedy Friedberg and Seltzer never mind the worst comedy or worst film ever made . At least the cast manage a dead pan manner throughout , though laughing and smiling isn't something you'd associate with this film be it working on it or watching . You do get the feeling that perhaps the cast deserved better",Meet the Spartans
8,Doylenf,"The pits...trashy spoof of ""300"" deserved winning five Razzies...",3,14 August 2012,"The only redeeming thing about MEET THE SPARTANS is that a few members of the cast really show signs of talent--and yes, I'm talking about Sean Maguire, Kevin Sorbo and Travis Van Winkle, three of the more prominent hunks in leather outfits. Sean has the principal role as Leonidas (immortalized by Gerard Butler in ""300""), and all three of them show a grasp of comic delivery with a silly line along with their impressive physiques.But the script is a total mess, inserting pop culture jokes and celebrities into many a moment in a grab for laughs, with only a few of them hitting the mark. The sets aren't that bad and the costuming is what you'd expect in this kind of spoof.Carmen Electra walks through her role in such a stiff manner, she makes Maria Montez (of the '40s Sabu films) look like a thespian. The jokes are flat, the dialog is sophomoric and the whole mess is punishment to sit through after the first fifteen minutes.",Meet the Spartans
9,dbborroughs,Better than the last bunch of spoof films but still not enough jokes to justify paying to see in theaters I'd wait for cable.,3,2 March 2008,"Enough with the spoof movies. Essentially a remake of 300 with jokes and spoofs attached, this film has some laughs, but at roughly 70 minutes before the end credits (which continue on with the spoofing) this is a 5 or 10 minute sketch stretched to barely feature length. To be honest the film is not ""bad"", and in its way it is better than the last of these sort of films (what was that Epic Movie?) but it just goes on and on and on over killing the jokes (how many people will be knocked into the pit of death?) or stretching the march to the punchline past the point where they are funny. Had I seen this on TV for free I probably would have enjoyed it more, but the thought that I actually paid money, even bargain matinée money, to see this hurts. I did laugh, but at the same time I feel raped. Wait for cable.",Meet the Spartans
10,Boba_Fett1138,"Well, in all honesty it was better than any other Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer directed movie I've seen so far.",3,16 October 2008,"Yes, amazingly enough I have to conclude that this was the best Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer directed movie I've seen in my entire life. It doesn't mean that this movie is exactly brilliant though. It's incredibly lame, features embarrassingly bad and unfunny moments and is basically a movie purely made to cash in. Simple fact is that as long as these movies are making money, more like them will likely get made and released. And this movies are making big money. Every time a Friedberg/Selzer parody gets released I see it somewhere in the top of the box office lists. I really don't understand this. Don't people by now know who Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer are and what type of movies they make? I'm never telling people to boycott movies or film-making but now I'm simply begging everyone to stop and pay money to see these type of movies, it's the only way we can stop them from being produced. Power to the people! Yes, I know I'm also still watching these movies, so I probably look guilty as well but at least I'm not paying any money for it to do so.The movie is titled ""Meet the Spartans"", so yes it indeed is mostly a spoof of the movie ""300"" and it follows basically the same plot line and type of characters but as you could expect from a Friedberg/Selzer the movie is spoofing tons of other recent successful movies as well, as well as some famous movie and TV celebrities. Like always the movie is bombarding us with this. Joke after joke is being put in the movie, as if they were thinking lets put in as many comical moments as possible and some of them are just bound to hit. I must admit, some jokes do hit and is the reason why I regard this movie as the best one from Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer but unfortunately it's only about 5% of the jokes and comical moments that do hit and made me laugh. 95% of the rest of the movie is just an utter waste of time and insulting to anyone's intelligence. No, there is nothing wrong with some silly comedy from time to time but not when it is as embarrassingly bad as is the case with ""Meet The Spartans"" and every other Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer movie for that matter.But I always have to give this movie credit for one thing; it's always good and professionally looking. There is still obviously some money and effort put into this movie and it has a good visual look over it. What it also does well is re-playing some of the well known sequences from ""300"". I'll guess you'll probably hate this movie less if you've seen ""300"" and most of the other movies that are being spoofed within this movie.Also most of the actors do a decent job impersonating the actors from ""300"". Of course most characters are just totally bad and lame though but I don't think you can blame the actors for this. I think it was also a good choice to give Carmen Electra a much bigger role this time because lets face it, her appearances basically always had been part of the highlights of any other Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer movie. Also quite fun that Kevin Sorbo has a big part in the movie. He is of course best known for playing Hercules in the hit-series and TV movies. So he's perfectly in place in this movie, despite the fact that he already was 50 at the time of this movie.For what it's worth; it's better than any other Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer movie I've seen before in my life. It doesn't mean this movie is watchable or recommendable though. Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer made lame and bad comedy spoofs in the past and they will also just never become good at it. Please simply boycott their next movies when it will hit the cinema and you'll help to prevent these types of movies from being made and you'll stop unfunny and untalented people such as Friedberg and Seltzer from ever making a movie again. Thank you very much!3/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Meet the Spartans
11,view_and_review,Stream of Pop Culture Jokes,6,22 October 2021,"""Meet the Spartans"" embodied what the spoof comedies became in the 2000's. They were always silly, but in the 2000's they devolved into crass jokes of every imaginable thing that was popular at that time. In that respect, ""Meet the Spartans"" was definitely no worse than most of the spoofs in the 2000's and probably even better than most of them. This one took aim at ""300,"" for starters, and the homo-eroticism of the movie (which it definitely had), then everything else after that. Google 2003-2008 pop culture and it was probably featured in this movie; not in a clever way, but shoe-horned in there just to fit it in.",Meet the Spartans
12,neil-476,"See, the thing about spoofs....",5,11 December 2010,"Let's concentrate on the good points for a moment.They've obviously put some effort into trying to capture the distinctive look which Zack Snyder achieved in putting Frank Miller's vision on screen.Also, the voice-over is a pleasingly accurate spoof of David Wenham's in the original.Sadly, after that, we have to look at the bad points.I'm going to avoid wasting time by saying that there is one which overshadows all the others - it isn't funny. And that, surely, is the main objective of any spoof. Make sure the script is funny before you start, guys.",Meet the Spartans
13,anaconda-40658,Meet the 300!,6,1 May 2015,"Meet the Spartans (2008): Dir: Jason Friedberg, Aaron Seltzer / Cast: Sean Maguire, Carmen Electra, Ken Davitian, Kevin Sorbo, Diedrich Bader: A brand new appeal for those barbaric Spartans dudes whose lives are bent around combat. Sean Maguire plays the new Spartan King but the Persians are closing in. The course of action is war. Setup is best written following 300 but after the initial premise, the film becomes episodic and rides into overkill. Too many references to game and reality programs drain much humour. It is as if the filmmakers needed to fill space so they referenced every stupid reality show within reach. Directors Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer are backed with production that mocks its targets. They previously made Date Movie and the pathetic Epic Movie. Maguire is suited for the role of Spartan King but after his introduction where he kicks several people, including pop star Britney Spears into a pit, the film settles for mindless violent idiocy. Carmen Electra as the Queen has her moments but the role is too standard. Ken Davitian is featured as the Persian ruler. Kevin Sorbo plays the Spartan captain of the guard. Diedrich Bader is present just as he usually is but never as good as he was in Office Space. Spartans are met with tremendous attack on pop society that might have sounded good on paper but the results are a mixed. Score: 6 / 10",Meet the Spartans
14,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Meet the Spartans,1,29 February 2008,"With my workload getting increasingly heavy, and working on super secret projects that hope to see the light of day by end of the year, you should come to expect my reviews here returning to their titular roots, presented as far as possible in capsule style. And I kind of expected it to be so with the first movie I've seen after consciously making that resolution.Meet the Spartans is a waste of time. It has zero naturally funny moments, and lacked that creative, funny spark that would turn scenes into instant livewires. The gist of it is to poke fun at last year's 300, but what resulted was a whole host of lifeless jokes that do not tickle you at all. Again, it preys rather lazily at the wealth of material offered by pop culture, with references to recent movies galore, and taking the mickey out of celebrities from Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton to Sylvester Stallone and many more which only can be seen midway through the end credits roll (which made you wonder, when the credits were rolling, why you see many more cast who don't make it to the story proper).Again, Carmen Electra vamps it up as a trashy, slutty character, this time Queen Margo, wife of Leonidas (Sean Maguire), with Kevin Sorbo (television's Hercules) as Captain of the Spartan warriors who defend their lands from the invasion of Xerxes (Ken Davitian, Azamat from Borat) and his digital effect Persian army. While there are no big stunt action sequences, what came across was perfectly cheap, from landscapes right down to costumes. And the jokes don't let down from ribbing homosexuality, especially amongst the Spartans, and too much of something makes one sick.Moreover, there seemed to be a fixation from writers-directors Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer on spoofing one too many television series. From American Idol, to Deal or No Deal, every game show had to be featured, made fun of, and then discarded, and what really irked were the lacklustre lookalikes who, unfortunately, don't look alike at all. Far from it. Expect the usual crass jokes, except this time, the jokes seem to be constipated. It's not funny, and not trying to be funny. I guess there's an art to being funny and making comedies, but Jason and Aaron just don't cut it. While Scary Movie had enough to spawn sequels (which number 4 was quite a let down), Meet the Spartans will join the fates of wannabes like Date Movie and Epic Movie - forgettable. And one wonders why anyone in the right mind will fund projects like these, and also, the various companies with blatant product placements to be associated with junk too.You might say given that I know what's coming, why bother to watch this in the first place. Guess I'll still have to venture to hell to warn others to keep clear of this turkey. This wholeheartedly deserves to go to the trash bin, and automatically a contender for worst picture of the year. It's a comedy that doesn't even try to be an iota of funny.",Meet the Spartans
15,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Sloppy, but fun",4,26 January 2008,"I was looking forward to seeing Meet the Spartans, from the first few theatrical trailers, it looked like a lot of fun and not like a horrible parody. But I have to admit that when it had it's TV spots, it was starting to look bad, but my boyfriend and I still saw it last night, just to see maybe if it still had some laughs. Now, while I'm still disappointed in most of the movie, there were a few good laughs I think. It was made pretty badly, but I think most spoof movies are made that way since they don't have a sense of reality, so I'll be kind on that subject. Plus, the movie in general was weird, they took on the movie 300, fully, like re-shot the entire film, and just added their own jokes on TV, movies, pop culture, and random things.Leonidas has just been made king of Sparta, and his world is rocking with his bombshell wife, Queen Margo, and life couldn't be better. But when he is challenged by the Persians, he must protect Sparta with, well, only 8 guys. But hoping that ""they will survive"", they go into a battle of stomping the yard, talking smack, and even having to deal with some transformers. Leonidas is getting more and more steamed though as he realizes that the blue screen Persians may be too much for he and his team can handle.Meet the Spartans had some really funny moments, like I loved and nearly died laughing when the Spartans were leaving their country and they left hand in hand singing ""I will Survive"", it was so stupid, I know, but if you let go and have fun, I'm sure you'll laugh too. But there were things I was disappointed in, like the constant potty humor, it would be nice if the writers grew past the second grade level humor. There was some jokes that were predictable and used too many times in other spoofs. But over all this was definitely better than Epic Movie or Date Movie. If you go to see this, there are a few laughs, but don't expect the best comedy of the year.4/10",Meet the Spartans

17,OllieSuave-007,Another dumb spoof.,4,10 December 2013,"This is another movie spoofing a host of movies, most notably 300, where Spartan King Leonidas, armed with only leather underwear and a cape, leads 13 misfit warriors to defend their homeland against the invading Persians, which include Ghost Rider, Rocky Balboa, the Autobots, a hunchbacked Paris Hilton and a shaved-head Brittany Spears.To me, it was just a lot of forced, weird comedy consisting of crude jokes and overly-done effects. A lot of the gags and spoofs were just mentioned and quick references, not really emphasized; I would have liked to see Brad Pitt and Angelique Jolie's characters spoofed more. Kevin Zorbo was funny, though, and I liked how they portrayed the look-alikes.The overall story was pretty boring and the film lacked the direction and spirit of the better spoof films like the Zucker Brothers' Airplane!, Top Secret!, the Naked Gun movies and the Scary Movie films. Those were real, truly funny spoof films that you should really go watch, versus this one.Grade D-",Meet the Spartans
18,Buddy-51,Beyond awful,2,14 October 2008,"Those who haven't seen the movie ""300"" probably won't get most of the jokes in ""Meet the Spartans,"" and those who HAVE seen it probably won't get them either. That's because for any audience this is one of the worst, most jaw-droppingly witless parodies in motion picture history (and that's saying quite a lot).Suffice it to say that this slapdash mixture of gladiator-movie clichés and truly lame pop culture references has enough homophobic jokes to set the cause of gay rights back a good quarter of a century or more (OK, these Spartan warriors like men; we get it, we get it!).Indicative of the movie's utter failure at pacing and timing are two scenes - one at the ""pit of death"" and another featuring a step-dance competition between the Greeks and the Persians - that drone on for a minor eternity.

Just a list of some are American Idol, Dancing with the Stars, Deal or No Deal, Stomp, Paris Hilton, Brittany Spears, Brangelina, Spiderman. Carman Electra plays Leonidas Queen; she also gets around as Leo finds out when he sees her tattoo that says he was there, as well as Tommy Lee...all the way down to the Oakland Raiders.

I only chuckled once and nearly puked the other times because it was so bad. There is no need to describe the plot. The plot is basically the same as 300 with American culture things thrown it. I think that the creators of this movie went overboard with the gay jokes. The creators have to know that gay jokes are funny at a minimum, not like in this movie. The only reason I gave this movie a 3 because the joke regarding Britney Spears is a bit funny and Carmen Electra is pretty.

That, right there, is a literal quote from this coma-inducing parody. An abomination that believes itself to be so self-aware, that it has transcended comedy as an entire genre. No, seriously. Friedberg and Seltzer fully acknowledge how low they have stooped, just for one measly laugh from a societal degenerate watching this in the hope they are experiencing a future masterpiece.Within the first whole minute of runtime, baby Shrek vomits on a peasant and is subsequently kicked down a cliff, abandoned to die for its deformity. A Vietnamese child is then gently put on display for ""Brangelina"" to waltz on over and adopt the youngling, seemingly mocking their generous intents as doting parents. And then Leonidas, with a fully grown beard at the age of one, is accepted as a Spartan. But to become king, he must endure brutal training in order to hunt down (wait for it...) ""gangsta penguin"". Essentially 'Happy Feet' with a black man's attitude. Years later Carmen Electra erotically dances, objecting herself and women in general for all those white nerdy virgins who want to bash one out in front of the screen, and a messenger from Xerxes wanders across. He is taught the gender greetings within Sparta. High fives for the ladies, and open mouthed kissing with tongues for the gents. Aren't gay jokes absolutely frickin' hilarious? Blah blah blah, Leonidas shouts the famous line and kicks the messenger down a badly visualised pit. Along with Britney Spears during her mid-life crisis shaving moment, the panel from 'American Idol' and some other singer who doesn't ring any bells with me whatsoever.Ladies and gentlemen, that's all you need to know about Meet The Spartans. Just a montage of celebrity re-enactments, American game/talent shows, a plethora of ""spoofs"" from unrelated films released in '07 and a bunch of actors destroying the flimsy remains that they call ""careers"". Sexual exploitation, homophobic slurs and borderline racism round off the ""humour"" that opts to gross viewers out instead of injecting some stimulating hilarity. So yeah, no thanks. The irony in all this, is that this isn't the worst parody feature from these directors! Mind-boggling to say the least. Oh, and Lindsay Lohan predictably gets mocked once again...",Meet the Spartans
24,Anonymous_Maxine,I have not seen this movie.,1,17 March 2008,"If you look through my reviews, you'll notice that I've reviewed three Scary Movies, along with Epic Movie (with which this movie deservedly shares a spot on the IMDb Bottom 100) not long ago, and in most of them I berate myself for being stupid enough to waste my time watching them. This is the first time I've ever written a review of a movie I haven't seen, and I do it only because I've thrown away so many hours watching the ridiculous tripe that these idiots continue to defecate into theaters. In this case, thankfully, the trailer alone was enough to show me that it was going to be more of the idiotic, nonsensical garbage we have come to expect from Friedberg and Seltzer. I'm willing to bet that their parents tell people that they haven't heard from their kids in years and don't know what they are up to because they don't know how to get a hold of them. Aren't they making those movies, though? No, no, no, no, no, that's not my son. Definitely not. My son is, ah, anyone else.Have you seen those yellow warning signs that say ""Caution: This is Sparta""? THAT is funny. You don't even have to watch it to know that this movie is not. There are a lot of times when you can ignore the nay-sayers and watch a badly reviewed movie anyway and make up your own mind. This is not one of those times.No stars.",Meet the Spartans

But still, unlike the awful ""Epic Movie"", I actually did laugh at some of these jokes, at least the first time. Okay, doing a pixelated genital shot once is funny once, the third time it isn't. Doing a ""implied homo-erotic"" joke is funny once, it isn't funny by the 100th reference.A lot of the actors looked like they just didn't care, especially Carmen Electra. (I've seen her be funny in other stuff, I don't know why she isn't bothering here.) I felt more sorry for Kevin Sorbo, who looked like he was trying to make an effort, while his fellow actors were just doing lines by rote.",Meet the Spartans
26,davispittman,Hot men is about it LOL,3,20 March 2016,"Meet the Spartans has some hot male eye candy, but to be completely honest, that's about it. Travis Van Winkle is OK in his role, he's hot, bulging with muscles, and well that's all his character is supposed to be about, so I guess it works. Carmen Electra was funny at certain times, but honestly not many. Sean Maguire is hot, handsome, manly and overly macho, and that's also all his character is supposed to be about, so I suppose he was alright, his butt is nice lol, you do get to see that in 1 scene. Kevin sorbo, wtf Is he doing in this film?!!! He went from meet the Spartans to gods not dead?! Lol, doesn't make much sense to me, but whatever floats his boat I guess. But really he seemed Sooo uncomfortable in this movie, Like he was randomly dropped on the set and didn't know what the heck was going on, maybe he's just too conservative to be in a movie like this. But anyways, there are scenes in the film that are just too gross and tasteless, and it's not funny, it's just strange and uncomfortable to sit and watch. Although the love scene between Maguire and Electra was a little comical, it wasn't hilarious or anything, but slightly comical. Really there are not many laughs to be had in this film, male eye candy is really the only upside lol.",Meet the Spartans
27,TOMNEL,I left the movie tired and depressed.,1,27 January 2008,"The only reason I went to see this movie, was because I knew it was going to be bad. That's obviously not a good reason, but in retrospect, some really bad movies are funny when thought about later. I've had chuckles about how bad Epic Movie was, but this....this was different. Maybe it was the fact that half the audience was laughing at these awful jokes, or the fact that this stupid monstrosity was even green lighted, but after this ended I felt drained of my life. No movie has ever made me feel this way.""Meet the Spartans"" has the sparse running time of 65 minutes (not counting the lengthy end credits), which was a blessing to the audience. The jokes all feel like ones that 9 year old boys would find hysterical, where everyone else would just hate them. Other than spoof jokes, every other joke is one involving pain. There were dozens of crotch hits and back breaks. There are also many gross out, vomit, sneezing, and boil bursting jokes. There was one joke that had me mildly chuckling, but then they killed the joke by over explaining it. It didn't need to be explained, a monkey could understand it. Repetitiveness was the only word that comes to mind when watching this. King Leonidas knocks a messenger in the hole, then his two men. Okay, not funny, but at least it's over....right? Nope. Then he knocks Sanjaya, Brittany Spears, Kevin Federline, The American Idol judges and Ryan Seacrest in the hole. After the credits seem to be over, deleted scenes are shown simply to make the movie more than 70 minutes. During the deleted scenes, Dane Cook, George W. Bush, Tom Cruise, and Ellen Degeneres are also knocked in the hole. The joke is done 10 times over.The two extremely untalented writers of this mess want to include every movie possible, and mention every celebrity they can, and include any show they can cram in. There are 3 instances of celebrity panels judging the Spartans in this, and it's not like it was a running joke either. It was just lack of ideas. Much of the celebrity humor was just the celebrities pointing out their character traits. Paris Hilton, who is in a few scenes, but ultimately disappears with no point, talks about her jail time. Brittany Spears acts crazy. Lindsey Lohan gets out of rehab. Tyra Banks shows her cellulite. And every other celebrity that is made fun of, has the exact same role. Also, there is a joke in poor taste. When Leonidas is going to be killed by a talking penguin, it says, ""Say hi to Anna Nicole Smith for me."" These idiot writers are stooping as low as to make fun of people being dead? It's terrible. References to TV were thrown around, usually making no sense and totally pointless. Ugly Betty is the oracle. Just plain stupid. The movies were also thrown about all over so people in the audience could say, ""Duh, I know what they're referencing."" To give away a mild spoiler and one of the dumbest scenes in the movie, Carmen Electra's character turns into Spiderman and she beats up the Sandman, who is then pooped on by a cat. It made no sense why it was thrown in here. That's how I felt about pretty much every part of this movie though.Now, back to myself. When the movie ended after just over an hour, I had a headache, and wondered how dumb some people truly are, because nobody of any intelligence could've thought this was hilarious. But of course this is my opinion, and warning, don't see this movie! It will cause depression.My rating: Possibly worst movie I've ever seen. 80 mins.

And its just downhill from there...Comments: Sure its crude, and sure, its jokes are well under the belt sometimes. But after a long day at work when your head has just quit on you, this is the kind of movie that is perfect. In fact, I would recommend watching this movie only when you're dead tired, because then it suddenly becomes great (otherwise it will be a big time disappointment).And to be honest, from time to time it actually delivers a good spoof or gag at another movie. Mostly its 300, but among others Casino Royale, Happy Feet, Transformers, American Idol get hit. Quite fun actually.I found myself laughing most of the time.

""Date Movie"" was decent and cute, but should've been better. ""Epic Movie"" was a step up from their previous film. I actually laughed a lot in that. Now here comes ""Meet the Spartans."" Let me say this now: This is by far the most disappointing and most irritating thing I've ever seen!What happened?! I know people didn't like neither the other two films (even though I did) but I think I get what they're saying! Unlike their last two films (yes, they're different), this film is like a marketing campaign, for random items! I see it now: The films they make continuously have more pop culture reference than any other film. ""Date Movie"" wasn't all that much, really. Still have no reason why people didn't like that. ""Epic Movie"" had even more, but at least they were funny.This is by far the lamest attempt to make something funny. There is a point (actually, an early point) in the film where I found it offensive on a recently dead celebrity. They try so hard to make this film funny! Okay, at first, I found some jokes funny. Then it all went downhill. I also find it sad more of the MadTV ensemble is in here.This is like a MadTV skit. Each skit could be funny or fall flat. I liked the previous two films because each most of the skits were funny. Now, I did laugh at some parts for this film. I liked the Brangelina joke and possibly the jokes on homophobia until it really got very sad.Other than that, the jokes are crude, sexual, disgusting, or predictable. If you're looking for action, don't bother. If you're looking for hot babes and hunky guys, you're in luck, because this film has so many to stare at. Other than that, there is no reason to see this film. I also think that the directors think audiences are getting stupider. The jokes to the reference of pop culture are said out loud, like nobody in the audience knew, like ""It's HAPPY FEET!"", ""Thhe guy from BORAT!"", ""MaGuire from SPIDER-MAN 3!"", ""The TRANSFORMER cube!"", etc.Sure, the previous movies may ace but lame attempts to get laughs from the audience but they were funny.

King Leonidas rules Sparta, but he's very dim-witted. When he hears that Xerxes wants to conquer Sparta, he asks the Oracle (Ugly Betty) for permission to go to war. When Leonidas and Captain set out for Thermopylae, they only have 13 soldiers instead of 300.

I didn't even pay to see this, and I'm still embarrassed to admit that I saw it.All this does is take pop culture references and some of last years so called hit films and somehow mishmashes them together. When you have Rocky Balboa, the fat guy from Borat and lots of dancing based on Dancing with The Stars and other dance films, all mixed together, the result is destined to be the IMDb's worst ranked films in the top 250 futile films. I laughed when Britney got thrown into the pit of despair, and that's about it. But the rest of the jokes are so one dimensional, and so void of any intellect, that they have to repeat the same ones three of four times. There weren't even enough jokes to fill a 75 minute film. I guess there is a market for this type of entertainment or it wouldn't gross 18 mill on it's first weekend, but the humour is sad, the film making is terrible and the writing is a travesty.

Anyone who doesn't know need not apply. I can't believe I'm saying this but there are more substantial train wrecks than this horrible, disgusting, unfunny, idiotic, pathetic, shameless, inconsistent, insulting, asinine, foolish, oafish, and insignificant (I need to look up more words in the dictionary to describe this movie) waste of time and money (but since I mercifully saw it on TV, at least I'm not guilty at wasting any cash).It's probably much more fun to write a review about this piece of crap by imagining how Friedberg and Seltzer came up with this incredible idea.Friedberg: ""Hey! I just saw 300 man! It was awesome! But you know what's more awesome? Why don't we make a comedy about it? I mean come on! These guys are wearing like, what are those, skirts? Are they gay or something? Why don't we make a movie where these Spartan dudes are gay! People will dig that right? I mean they dig anything 300 these days!""

Tell you what, we'll combine our ideas together to make a masterpiece. Yeah! This will be big! I'm having an epiphany right know! Wait a minute... Epipihany, what does that mean anyway? Never mind, so here it is: We set this in the same time as 300. That was like, before the first World War, right? So these 300 dudes are like gay right? So we'll just remake the whole story of 300 only make it funny. Yeah, and we'll put in those pop culture references of yours and that will just be a gas!

Only Spielberg never thought of having that guy from Borat playing Xerxes or have Rocky, Ghost Rider, that dancing penguin from Happy Feet, and Carmen Electra in one movie! By the way, Spielberg did this movie with this guy Bay about Transformers. I was thinking, why not put in a giant robot? People will laugh like crazy, man! I mean, we don't have the budget, but hey, we made that classic EPIC MOVIE without having to spend lots of cash.

""Meet The Spartans"" follows the same offensive trend of ""Epic Movie"" and ""Disaster Movie."" Very little plot, very little originality, endless insults and material to embarrass their actors, and why is Carmen Electra allowing herself to be embarrassed time and time again. Kevin Sorbo looks uncomfortable in the movie, and Sean McGuire over-acts his part. Once so enjoyable on MadTV, Nicole Parker is just barely enjoyable, highlighting brief moments with her whimsical overdone impressions of characters, and while her Britney Spears take is now extremely dated, her treatment of Paris Hilton is a bit late. The only thing that makes the movie any better is the DVD commentary as token cast members and the writers critique themselves, cringe at their own performances and give behind the scenes trivia and stories from backstage.

Having seen 300, I was pretty sure that it would help me understand the pop culture references and appreciate the ""wacky"" humor more.And it certainly would.

These guys don't seem to know when something works and when a joke goes on waaay too long, (the dance-off and Oracle temple scenes could've been about thirty seconds long, and they STILL wouldn't be funny.)

Lots of gross-out gags like the ones parodying CASINO ROYALE, GTA SAN ANDREAS and BORAT; such wonderful scenes as a baby knocking out a old lady and she spits her false teeth, a penguin jumping on the leading man with the stuff on his face, the fat villain that puts earrings in his nipples and much more.Just like for the other parody movies by the genius team of Friedberg-Seltzer, the problems with this movie are: parodying everything and trying to cram everything in the movie; unfunny and juvenile humour, gross out gags that would make even a 12 year old bored to death and bad acting all around. The only two that looks like they are desperately trying are Kevin Sorbo and Carmen Electra, but the rest of the cast is bad.There was one part that made me laugh: the one of the pit of death when Leonidas kicks everybody (including the AMERICAN IDOL jury, a Britney Spears look alike and her then-husband Kevin Federline, a crested rapper and many others) in the pit of death, and in one scene he kicks just like Jean Claude Van Damme.

The movie jumps the shark pretty early on (actually in less than 3 minutes) by showing adult Leonidas going out to fight the wolf when in the real movie it was a very young man who did that.The awful Shrek & Exorcist parodies were dire and the film had barely started too! I assume the dancing penguin was a ""Happy Feet"" parody? (Having never seen it).There's also the HUGE goof where the penguin shits in Leonidas' face and in the next scene he's totally clean.Now, what was the point of the Britney Spears scene? It didn't fit into the movie at all, they totally had to shoehorn that scene in. And who was that idiot with the hair saying ""I'm not gay?"", come to that who is Ryan Seacrest? If your going to sell a movie all over the world don't use Americans who aren't known outside the US? We get that the original movie seemed very homo-erotic in places but this thing just kept shoving the gay references at us over and over. I got the ""Ugly Betty"" reference but the girl playing her didn't sound very Latino and all the awful Mike Myers jokes that weren't funny when he was doing them in ""Wayne's World""? Now the Gatorade ad spoof is pretty pointless as that stuff only retails in the US and the ""I will survive"" skit, even 300 wasn't THAT gay!. The ""Sparta's next Top Model"" skit was pretty pointless as well as half the planet aren't going to get that.Likewise the ""Stomp The Yard"" skit, only going to be funny if you've actually seen the movie which a LOT of people haven't.Now the Spiderman vs Sandman scene totally didn't work (made even worse by having a woman play Spidey too!). Giving Kevin Sorbo (who must either really need money badly or was doing this as a favour to someone) the line ""I'm gonna go Hercules on your ass"" is about the funniest joke in the whole movie which speaks volumes about the rest of the film really.The Ghostrider & Rocky spoofs are pretty awful and Kevin Sorbo gets a half decent death. Again referencing something like ""Grand Theft Auto"" isn't going to work as not everyone has played it.I must say Xerxes' ""Transformer Cube"" looked more like the box out of Hellraiser.

There are some bits in it that are quite good, but bits on their own are not enough.For me the best parts of the film were in the after-credits. There was some things in there that could have fitted into the rest of the film but got placed there instead and they did well. I love films that make fun of violence, even when it's used against children. It's bad humor, but that is what it is. Humour. Nothing I'd ever approve of in real life, but on the screen it's something else.Anyway, this one is not worth remember, not worth the tape it is filmed on and I hope the next parody tries some harder and does not take a lot of US only references because it just doesn't work.4 out of 10 legendary Kings queen-ed.",Meet the Spartans

A film so ludicrously bad that you chuckle throughout, partially out of disbelief at how bad it is and partially because you just feel sorry for Friedberg and Seltzer because of how bad they are, MTS may not be quite as awful as Disaster Movie thanks to a grand total of 2 decent jokes, but it is undeniably an atrocious cinematic work. The film is so thin that it's only 65 minutes long. To get this to feature length, the end credits are really long and extended with deleted scenes. It's bad. I'm running out of ways to emphasize that now.The jokes are appalling. They're overdone, desperate, often sexist, weird, juvenile and just not funny. If you do laugh, you laugh at it not with it. The direction is also painfully awful, and this is as artistic as a muddy rainwater puddle thanks to the directors' total lack of effort. The acting is expectedly terrible, and the film suffers in general from its lack of wit, intelligence, structure and anything to make it feel like an actual movie, rather than some cruel form of cinematic torture. It's difficult to pick out the worst joke, although the tedious, face palm inducing sequence of celebrities getting kicked into the pit of death, a silly slow motion battle scene and a GTA scene which just doesn't make any sense stick in the memory. The ending is not remotely satisfying and this is not just a terrible film, it's one with a sexist, obnoxious personality and something which seems to be out to ridicule the films we like in an offensive manner. It's a pathetic spoof with no value whatsoever. It somehow made $84.6 million worldwide. Depressing.1/10",Meet the Spartans
46,loganx-2,All That Is Wrong With The World.,1,11 June 2008,"One of the worst things I've ever seen. The moments I smiled a bit, the marching with the blue screens at the end for instance, did not make up for the multiple scenes with projectile vomiting, and the constant horribly tacked on inclusion of the worst of TMZ culture Brittany Spears, American Idol, Paris Hilton, game shows like Deal Or No Deal, Dance Movies, etc. Probably the worst movie of the year. It's sad to see Kevin Sorbo and even Method Man sinking this low. I'm really amazed that even in the days of ""Scary"", ""Epic"", ""Teenage"", and ""Superhero"" movies, ala (Superhero Movie), that something as bad as this could still be made, and could take in as much at the box office and on video as it surely will. 300 may have been homophobic, and self indulgent, but no movie deserves a parody of this quality.",Meet the Spartans

There are better spoof movies than this(see Naked Gun series, Airplane! and Kentucky Fried Movie) for crying out loud!!! Friedberg and co really believe that their ""material"" based on pop culture references is funny. It's not. You can get the same experience just by drinking alcohol or getting high. THAT is an understatement. With people's tastes in movies nowadays, its supply and demand. The more you watch, the more crap like this studios will churn out over and over again.

48,ttapola,Horror Infinity,1,26 February 2011,"Refusing to spend any money to see this movie, I had to wait nearly 3 years until it premiered on TV. Seeing as this had made it to the infamous Bottom 100, I sadly consider this movie to actually be a useful tool for calibrating one's rating scale. But *only* for that purpose, not for entertainment. Truly, they don't come any worse than this.Even at 84 minutes, this movie struggles to fill its runtime. When the ""parody"" of 300 is over and the end credits start running, this is still barely over 70 minutes, so they add all the alternate and abandoned scenes to the end! These clunkers are so bad I cannot even imagine what horrors they have included as DVD/Blu-ray extras...One always hears the words ""I did not laugh a single time during that load of crap"", but most often even a terrible movie elicits at least one laugh from the viewer. Now I have seen a movie during which I truly did not laugh even a single time. I did not even smile. At best, my mouth may have twitched once, but it might have been a muscle spasm.The makers of these movies should learn one simple lesson since they obviously cannot be *prevented* from making them in the first place: do NOT attempt to make parodies of money shot scenes that in the original movies cost millions of dollars. Your ""parody"" will only become even more embarrassing than it already is. I feel pity for the technical crew, whose talent was wasted on this - obviously this was done so fast and cheap that the producers couldn't afford to pay them do spend the required time to do their work properly. Even the few talented actors who appear here seem to have been ""directed"" to act their scenes only once - which is kinda ironic, considering the ""writing"" is so bad, an infinite amount of takes would not have improved the end result.Bottom line: *Believe* IMDb. This 1/10 movie should be buried into the crust of the Earth. Anyone who likes this is out of their mind. Yes, I really mean that.

The part where the lead spartan goes into Grand theft auto, then starts playing, Barbie girl, but other than that, it isn't that funny. It might be because I never saw many movies paradied in this film, but still. Well, at least the directors learned their mistake and fixed it with disaster movie, which brought back the funny.

Not only is it better than the film ""300"" its funnier as well. And this is funnier in a good way.Obviously in a movie like this there are numerous pop culture references. Such as Britney Spears shaving off all her hair, Ghost Rider, and those latest dance-off movies that have been released recently. And don't forget the references to American Idol. You can't go a modern movie without that.But one of the most obvious things is the the indirect reference and allusion towards homosexuality (or at least bisexuality). The '13', since they could not find 300 men to fit the physical standards, keep up the gayness with men greeting men with kisses and the wearing of tight leather underwear. Obviously I could say a lot of things, but that would ruin the movie.Overall, this isn't bad. I actually enjoyed myself. ""B""",Meet the Spartans

Yet I am very grateful that this little unpretentious year-end pantomime review of Hollywood's worst cinematic excesses is reaching its intended public. There is nothing wrong with a swift kick in the pants of subjects and individuals who should know better. As far as I am concerned, no parody will ever make fun ENOUGH of the belligerent, war-mongering, fascistic, racist, sadistic and homophobic aspects of ""300"". No film will humiliate ENOUGH the downgrading of Western civilization that are Britney Spears and Paris Hilton and the US obsession with celebrity, however undeserved. People go to this film because they crave its subject matter: bad movies passing as art, insane celebrities passing as human beings. They come away from it complaining that it is too vulgar, but apparently never take time to reflect that is exactly what their so-called culture has become: a quagmire of artlessness, violent acts, crude humour and body fluids. Everyone should thank the writers for telling it like it is.",Meet the Spartans
55,ExpendableMan,An unmitigated disaster on every level imaginable,1,26 March 2008,"I don't know what I was thinking, I really don't. I should have known that spending an evening watching Meet The Spartans would have been a waste of time and I can only put the decision to do so down to some inherent sadomasochism and a Freudian desire to bring myself pain, but good lord Meet the Spartans is terrible. In fact it's more than terrible. This movie is so unquestionably bad that it's staggering, it must take an unprecedented lack of talent to produce something so bad. So without further ado people I have to beg you, in the wake of this latest fiasco, PLEASE stop going to see movies by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. You know the sort - Scary Movie, Epic Movie, Date Movie yadda yadda yadda, each one of them a tedious marathon of pop-culture jokes blessed with the ability to miss anything that even resembles a funny joke yet still have idiots flocking to see them as they roll off the assembly line. This plea might seem hypocritical given that I've seen it, but hey, I played with the pirates and downloaded it for free. Get out of that one fatty.And if the abominable back-catalogue that these people have smeared across the face of the world isn't enough to convince you that this movie is painful to watch, let me put it this way: You remember all the classic spoof movies? Airplane, Hot Shots, Spaceballs, Top Secret and the immortal Naked Gun series? What made those movies hilarious examples of just how funny spoof films could be was down to two things; they told their own stories and took themselves seriously. No matter how recycled their plots might have been they were still fresh spins on the material and no matter how ludicrous the jokes got the actors still treated it with a deadpan sensibility.Meet the Spartans on the other hand doesn't do either of these things. It's just 300 with loads of gay jokes thrown in and actors who pull ludicrous faces throughout, each one of them missing the obvious point that for things to be funny, they shouldn't be behaving as if they are. Admittedly, the bit involving Leonidas beating the living daylights out of his son raises a chuckle but everything else falls dismally flat. In fact, it's hard to consider them to be jokes at all - most of the so called comic set pieces simply involve the Spartans doing something that the writers have seen on TV. They dance like the street gangs in Stomp The Yard, discuss terms with Xerxes by appearing on Deal Or No Deal and Rocky Balboa turns up as a member of the Persian army, all while tumbleweeds spin past at an alarming rate, the writers seemingly expecting their audience to laugh out of simple familiarity.So there we have it. I did not think I would ever see the day where I'd see a spoof movie so dismally free of comedy that not even watching it drunk off my face with six of my mates could make me laugh but it has happened. Hands down one of the worst films of the year thus far and likely to appeal only to two groups of people: morons and the rich, white-bred thirty year olds that made it. When there are funnier 300 parodies to be found on youtube that last mere minutes, you have to wonder why they bother.",Meet the Spartans

Aaron and Jason will continue to make these films in the hopes that people will see them and unfortunately for the intelligent people ... these movies still make enough money for them to be continuously made over and over.95% of this film is based on 300 spoof. So basically you are watching approximately 300 gay jokes crammed into 60 minutes. The other five minutes is a joke aimed at pop culture reference to an issue earlier in the year (ie. Lindsay Lohan's rehab), product placement, a joke aimed at Carmen Electra or an out-of-place parody for another film.The majority of the jokes are dragged on for far too long. For instance the Stomp The Yard parody lasts upward 3 minutes. This is the point where people start to think of hitting the close button on Windows Media Player. It's not even a Stomp The Yard parody since after its over the leading man says ""You got served"", which is of course the title for the movie You Got Served.Take a bunch of nobody actors, add in Carmen Electra, product placement, add in stupid gay jokes, terrible visual and special effects, and then have Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer write the screenplay...you end up with a movie like Date Movie, Epic Movie and this. This movie gives Farce Of the Penguins a run for its money. Hell even the ""dreaded"" Blair Witch Project is not as bad as this.

Most of Aaron and Jasons movie parodies aren't that great, but I HATE 300, I think it's one of the dumbest movies ever made and I love this film for making fun of it so well.I am sure mad to see it in the bottom 100, it goes to show that people don't watch a lot of movie, and pick on stuff like this because they are idiots and actually liked 300 and are ashamed to admit this movie made fun of it so well.From making fun of the pit of death, to the sprayed on abs, to the fact that no real man would eagerly want to die...it's here. at times trying to act serious in order to show the stupidity in 300. It really pokes fun at the homosexual aspect of 300 too which is great. The narrator being equally annoying to show how dumb the original was. Sean Maquire did such a wonderful job, he could've easily have been Leonidas in 300, but I like him so much better here making fun of that no talent having Gerald Butler. Brilliant decision to use Kim Davitian to portray Xerxis, I would've called him Xerox myself. The battles being things like dance offs and Paris Hilton as the humpbacked traitor, pure brilliant...loved it..OK so like I said this movie isn't that great except for making fun of 300 but that's enough for me.The other stuff added cracked me up ""Leave Britney Alone!!"" from you tube guy Chris C. was funny after Britney had been made fun of in this movie by the wonderful Nicole Parker. Britney Spears is perhaps the worst artist to ever come out and she can't sing at all and Nicole was just like her, I swear I couldn't tell the two apart. Loved them making fun of the worthless idiot judges of American Idol, because thats another show that the biggest fools on Earth watch, don't even get me started. Dane cook being made fun of, wow is there a LESS funny comedian ever than him? A lot of great puns and just loved seeing this little film again for my 3rd time.

60,ssvikas,Not a bad spoof; barring some loose script & gross stuff,4,24 April 2008,"300 was one really well made movie of 2006. The dark setting, chiseled six-pack bodies, flowing capes, strong dialog with a heavy dose of blood and gore are still vivid memory. To make a spoof of such a serious flick is no mean job really! Meet the Spartans is definitely a decent effort to give a comic twist to most of the heavy duty stuff that 300 portrays. Nevertheless, this doesn’t come without with its own huge baggage! Set along the narrative of 300, this one too begins with the birth of Leonidas and his journey to becoming King. The fun starts right away with young Leonidas born with beard and abs, Casino Royale torture, his encounter with happy feet, are among the memorable funnies. The boy, returns to Sparta, now a King. Well, guess who plays his queen in this one? Carmen Electra! She did a great job, I mean looking good! Spoofed Sparta, like its original has muscled men too, but there are just a dozen for the battle of Hot Gates! And they have a flabby one who has fake abs painted on! The death pit scene too is funny with an American Idol twist! The oracle, oh, you got Ugly Betty there! Spoofed celebrities include Paris with a hunchback, Britney & Lindsey.The war here had less to do with blood and more to do with dance and ‘yo-momma’ stuff! They sure are a drag at some points. Xerxes here is reduced to a comic flabby guy offers to play Deal or No Deal with Leonaidas. What’s more? Transformers are here too, with Xerxes finding the Allspark! The end of the war though is a tad different here! Back at Sparta, there Queen Margo too has her own battle in Spiderman 3 style! To be honest, I don’t expect too much from spoofs, because they are meant to be no-brainers. Though ‘Meet the Spartans’ had its fair share of funny scenes to begin with, the narrative tends to lose track as it progresses. Making it worse are gross stuff coming up on screen at regular intervals. Though, just over an hour, you will not feel it was short! This movie is nowhere close to the quality of one of my favorite spoofs, Johnny English (2003), the bond spoof or even the others like the Scary Movie series. Austin Powers would get beyond comparison! To their credit though, the lead characters have really toned up their bodies a-la Leonidas, the Original. A final warning: If you haven’t seen 300, you may easily give this a skip, as most humor will not make much sense!",Meet the Spartans

""Meet The Spartans"" has bestrode (bestridden?) the U.S. film charts and is currently sitting triumphant at the top of the U.K. film charts.Frankly, this is not bad for a film that has been, more or less, universally lambasted and criticised as one of the worst films of the year. I think it just goes to prove the truth of what William Goldman wrote in his fine book ""Adventures In The Screen Trade"". Nobody knows anything.Anyway, what do I think?The best bits: Nicole Parker's takeoff of Britney Spears, which was brilliant and made me laugh a lot, and Carmen Electra's body.The worst bits: Er...

I would recommend it to everybody just for the comparison required to recognise a good movie when you see one. Just try not to think of the money it must have cost to make this masterpiece and the films that could have been made instead.Sigh.Still, to look on the bright side, it was nice to see the U.K.'s very own Sean Maguire, of ""Eastenders"" and ""Grange Hill"" fame, all buff, grown up and achieving success in the States.

Honestly, I like spoof movies as I like seeing how they poke fun of movies. It is not bad but it is a bit boring. The only interesting part that perk me up is the war scenes.Story: It is simple, the same story line for 300. Following the plot, there are spoofs of other movies being chunk into it. They spoof Spider-man, Deal or no deal and transformers etc. Sometimes, it is good to see people coming up with creative ideas for movies. Not that bad but they should think of better ideas.Overall: If you enjoyed Date movie and Epic movie and other spoof movies like Scary movies, you would probably like this. Nothing else to say. Hopefully, in future, they will do spoof movies seriously and not make them like dumb movies. More spoof movies are going to be made. For example, in March, there will be Superhero movie.

Comedy and satire is extremely difficult medium and this film takes a light hearted chuckling hit a really stupid films and is worth a view.I am really baffled why there is no higher quality satire films as many Indie and mainstream films really need sending up especially those with Australian content as they are usually really mediocre.If you can afford it and have seen the very few good movies then indulge yourself in this chuckle level movie with the added enjoyment of the trailer shot of ""Britney Spears"" being pushed into the pit of death.",Meet the Spartans
69,Jonathon_Natsis,Caution: Side effects may include suicide.,1,2 February 2011,"From the creativity-deprived Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer (Date Movie, Epic Movie, Disaster Movie) comes yet another film in their line of disastrous spoofs. With every one of these abominations that gets released on what seems to be a yearly basis, one must wonder what aspects of these films could possibly entice producers into letting this trash appear on the big screen over and over again.To briefly state the flimsiest of plots, we follow the Spartan King Leonidas ('we won't get sued, you say? Okay then, we'll stick with Leonidas') as he leads a group of misfit soldiers defending their homeland against the invading Persians. Obviously plagiarising the visually epic 300, this film cares less about constructing a cohesive (or even logical) plot than it does about inserting an avalanche of pop culture references into every situation possible.Whenever the term 'gratuitous' is used to describe a film, it is usually in order to criticise the excessive action, which has inevitably let down the overall appeal of a film. In this case, the excess is in relation to the directors' efforts to take a jab at every aspect of popular culture, from Michael Bay to Britney Spears, from Ugly Betty to Shrek. Uniquely, the poor form shown in this area does not detract from the rest of the film, solely because the references are the only point of the film. There are no progressive plot points, no efforts to invoke character development, and certainly no originality in the screenplay. The allusions are about as relevant as they are funny. In fact, they frequently flirt dangerously with the line of insulting the viewer's intelligence, regardless of how seriously you take your films.Anybody familiar with my reviewing style will know that, while I never hesitate to throw down my opinion on any film, I ultimately leave the decision up to the reader; simply offering a guide on how to critically approach the movie in question, and always accepting of other people's opinions, even if we can't agree. This is especially the case when critiquing a comedy: the most subjective of all movie genres. I cannot offer any of my fellow film connoisseurs that sort of leeway with Meet The Spartans. Nothing about this film came even close to forcing a mere chuckle out of me, let alone matching its advertising campaign as a light-hearted laugh riot. The best example of my rage towards this film is the running time. At just over sixty minutes long, it appears that even the writer/director combination of Friedberg and Seltzer gave up after realising they had squeezed the entire pop culture landscape dry, and decided to end the film when they couldn't think of anything screen-worthy to occupy the next half-hour.

So please stop the hysterical ranting and take a chill pill...I have seen some rotten movies in my time. Meet The Spartans would not be in my Top 100 worst movies - not in the Top 1000 even. It's a fairly innocuous bit of fluff. Mildly amusing, inoffensive, nothing special. It passed an hour.I thought the core actors tried their best despite a less than stellar script. Sean Maguire certainly didn't lack conviction and turned in an admirable performance in the circumstances. I didn't like the celebrity impersonators. They weren't very good and if you're going to go down that road then you need people at the top of their game. The female impressionist was particularly dire -- didn't look or sound convincing in any of her roles.However, the one thing that has most annoyed me about this movie are the parade of one star critiques on here. Not so much reviews as rants. The film isn't THAT bad. But even if it was, when someone says they hated first Date Movie, then Epic Movie, then Disaster Movie, why were they watching Meet The Spartans?

This, on the other hand, is a painful monstrosity of human torture.There's no comedy in this film, I do not consider it a comedy. It does not, in the slightest, attempt to be anything besides vulgar, stupid, and horrible. I honestly don't think they're trying to be funny, because nothing is a joke, it's just a reference extravaganza. You have movie references, youtube references, celebrity references, random butts in your face, etc. It's short, but it feels like an eternity. No scene makes sense and doesn't try to be funny.This is if you let a 12 year old direct. Nothing clever, funny, or even humanely normal. It's just a 86 minutes of random out of nowhere stupidity.

73,wwe7961,Yeah this film is really bad.,1,28 August 2010,"Friedberg/Seltzer responsible for some of the biggest abominations in film history. This is no different. The jokes never once made me laugh, the characters are really annoying, the acting is garbage, and the effects suck. It is following the story of the movie ""300"", but it just keeps shoving pop culture references in your face the whole time. They also have a lot of gay jokes that are really unfunny, and unclever. There is also a running gag of famous celebrities' vaginas. How could that in any way be funny? (Friedberg/Seltzer film conversation) ""Hey what random unfunny thing now should we insert in to mindf*ck the audience."" ""How about we show the audience Britny Spears' vagina censored"" ""Hey that is an awesome idea. Now where is my crack.""

74,TheMovieDoctorful,Seltzer And Friedberg Can Do So Much Worse,3,12 July 2015,"After sitting through ""Date Movie"", ""Epic Movie"", ""Disaster Movie"" and ""Vampires Suck"", it has become beyond obvious that the duo of Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg deserve every criticism they have received. Their films are unfunny, unintelligent and unbelievably painful. There's nothing I can say about them that would make their work any more entertaining or any less stupid. So what do I think of their ""300"" spoof ""Meet the Spartans?"" Well...""Meet the Spartans"" is Seltzer and Friedberg's best movie by FAR. Guess what? It still sucks. What saves ""Meet the Spartans""...Okay, um...Maybe ""saves"" is the wrong word. Uh...Anyways, what makes ""Meet the Spartans"" better and funnier than any other Seltzer and Friedberg film is that it has an EXCELLENT comedic cast. All of the actors chosen in this film seem to be chosen because they actually fit the roles and have tons of comedic presence instead of merely being chosen for star power. Kevin Sorbo has some very funny moments, Ken Davitian of ""Borat"" has good comedic presence and I actually found the whole concept of Diedrich Bader's character ""Traitero"" (A clever and actually really funny jab at action movies which make it incredibly obvious who the villain is the moment he or she steps on screen) quite humorous. That said, Sean Maguire gives by far the best comedic performance in the movie. This guy is given a script that gives him almost NO comedic possibilities and can truly turn out some hilarious moments. There are multiple scenes in this movie that would have completely and utterly failed in any actor's hands but his own. Seeing all these actors trying so hard to make this movie work despite such an atrocious script not only makes me like all of them more, it makes me hate Seltzer and Friedberg more for not utilizing their obvious talents better.The biggest problem with Seltzer and Friedberg is that they don't view their movies as actual ""films"" per say as much as giant feature length comedic skits. Like all of their movies, ""Meet the Spartans"" suffers from this problem. Because of this, the film literally doesn't go 20 seconds without a joke. Joke after joke after joke is launched at the audience, and many of them feel rushed and without effort. It was like Seltzer and Friedberg just wrote down the first jokes that came into their minds without reading them over, fleshing them out or even double checking if they fit into context. And the toilet humor...Dear God, the toilet humor. The toilet humor here is so stunningly unfunny it could sink even an otherwise excellent comedy.And if the toilet humor doesn't hurt your intelligence, then the constant pop culture references out of left field most certainly will. Apparently, Seltzer and Friedberg are people who think that a Spartan elder inspecting a baby Shrek is funny. No context by the way, the elder just inspects a baby and it happens to be Shrek, complete with a Scottish accent. If the film is extra cruel, it will combine its toilet humor and reference humor into some of the most unfunny scenes in the movie (I cringed HARD when a cat took a crap on Traitero's face after he randomly turned into Sandman)Like I implied earlier, there ARE funny scenes in this movie, saved by strong comedic performances rather than an even remotely intelligent script. The ""Deal or No Deal"" parody, Leonidas speaking to the Prophets about his unintentionally homo-erotic battle strategy and Xerces revealing his blue screen as a secret weapon to create more soldiers are all legitimately funny scenes. Easily the funniest scenes I've ever watched in a Seltzer and Friedberg movie, but that's really not saying anything at all.So yeah, ""Meet the Spartans"" is a terrible comedy. For most directors, this would easily be the worst thing they ever created. But for Seltzer and Friedberg, this is pretty much their magnum opus, and almost certainly the best you're ever gonna get from these two morons. At the very least it only made me cringe a few times, whereas I cringed pretty much every 30 seconds at ""Date Movie"" or ""Disaster Movie.""",Meet the Spartans

76,Vincent_B,A 60 minute product placement advertisement,1,21 August 2008,"Meet the Spartans was just over 60 minutes long and full of excessive product placements. I wouldn't even call them product placement but just commercials. The following is a brief example; three minutes in to the movie the main character is starving and finds a Subway foot long sub sandwich. There was no joke made about it other than Subway foot longs are not very tasty. Coke was proud sponsor of the Pit of Death joke. Apple Computers was the sponsor of the ""Wifely Advice"" scene which failed to get a laugh. Maybe it was supposed to be funny that primitive men had advanced technology like laptops and cell phones? Maybe once but not over and over and over. Other proud sponsors was UPS, Red Bull, Dentyne, Gator-aid, Budweiser, T-Mobile, Gray Goose Vodka and The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf. Yes all those in just 60 minutes not much room for humor.The jokes are in extremely poor taste, from child abuse, racism, homophobic slurs, overtly large male testicles, blurred shots of women's gentiles, and over done celebrity gags. The length of any given joke could last a long time. For example the ""Pit of Death"" joke ran a full 5 minutes long or 8% of this entire movie. There is a Paris Hilton joke about mid point in the 60 minute commercial that lasted too long and was later revisited again later for more pumping of an already dry well. Another gag that lasted 6 minutes or more, 10% of this film, was the break dance and yo momma routine and was an insult to the African American race. Promptly followed by a beer commercial.The actors like Carmen Electra is really getting too old at 36 to play as a sex symbol to us teens anymore. Unless you're into dating your mother. To me she looks like an average soccer mom. If you want to see Carmen Electra nude look at an old Playboy magazine she is not nude in this movie and I rented the unrated DVD. Sean Maguire seemed to be in pain more than anything else. His acting ability suffers greatly and his ability to deliver the bad homophobic jokes even more so. I was actually sad to see TV star Kevin Sorbo from ""Andromeda"" and ""Hercules"" having to suffer through this movie. Not that he had much of a career but he has lost any hope in acting since this disaster.As I mentioned I rented this movie for $2 at the local video store and when I took it back and told them how awful the movie was they refunded me my money. I hadn't spoken but about two sentences when the manager told me they couldn't in all honesty say it was a good movie to rent. They hope to rid themselves of the few copies they have in the store but since they are a franchise chain they must carry what they are told. I know just where this movie belongs at the very bottom. It should be #1 on the ""IMDB Bottom 100 Movies"". So vote and let's put this were it surely belongs!",Meet the Spartans

Excellent job indeed: with all the mess in making a loose parody and the negative reviews by just about anyone who's seen the movie (I haven't, but the trailers tell it all!) the makers of this spoiled parody have surely been successful: Successful at making those who loved the original crap version now go and believe more strongly in the fact that they did not make a mistake falling for that ""epic"" by the name of 300.If the original version (indeed a badly failed ""dark comedy!"" with enough childish pornography in it) did make many people think twice before going to waste their hard-earned cash on future ""Hollywood epics,"" then 'things' like this one will certainly make the same people stop wasting their valuable time as well on any future ""masterpieces"" by the Hollywood.(Whatever became of the times people witnessed true epics like Ben Hur or Cleopatra and so on coming from Hollywood?

Incidentally, not to see the original ""300"" would make watching this film a colossal waste of your time, for this same reason. I thought the star of the film who portrayed Leonitus, Sean MaGuire, was a spot-on, dead ringer for the original, and funny as hell. One the negative side, some of the gags in this movie tended to go on a little too long to sustain the laugh, but many of the scenes in this movie I thought were hilarious, just dying to be spoofed.

82,simonparker1990,Worse than Epic Movie...,1,25 March 2008,"Last year I saw a movie that left me speechless, literally speechless. Atonement, Stardust, Pirates of the Caribbean, hell they all had me talking happily afterwards, but Epic Movie, that just left me stone cold. I absolutely despised it, an unfunny, lousy excuse for a movie that made me horrified that people actually laughed in the cinema. I vowed never to watch that movie again and thankfully to this day I have not seen it again. However today, out of pure interest I ventured into Meet the Spartans. I didn't expect a good movie, in fact I only saw it to see if it was possible that a worse movie than Epic Movie could be made. And the movie did not disappoint. Meet the Spartans is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen in my life! I smiled once, mainly due to the randomness of the sequence, and the rest of it I spent in loathing. So many films are spoofed in this movie, and yet none of the spoofs are funny. 300, Shrek the Third, Transformers, Happy Feet, Ugly Betty, American Idol and unfortunately so many more movies and TV shows make a random and annoying appearance here. They mention Heroes and Star Wars as well, two of my most beloved things on the planet, just for them to be mentioned is rubbing salt in the already deep and painful wound this movie caused. The movie is also never funny, it tries to be funny, and admittedly unlike Epic Movie this did seem to be making an effort. But it just never pulls it off, the ""I will survive"" sketch involving the Spartans was admittedly funny, but it was overdone and then they repeated the scene again to no effect whatsoever! The performances are pathetic, the spoofing just annoying, in fact there are next to no positives about this movie whatsoever. The majority of the audience did not laugh once in my screen, which was a good thing as it might finally mean that we will see an end to this ridiculous spoofs. But alas, Superhero Movie was advertised just before this, and that looks quite poor as well.So let me go onto the performances. In spoof movies nowadays I never expect a decent performance, in fact the only actor I ever rely on in a spoof movie is Leslie Nielson, who thankfully did not sign on for this wretched movie. Instead we get Sean Maguire, whose CV includes EastEnders, unfortunately that pretty much explains the extent of his talent right there. Maguire ranges from stupidly annoying (the earlier scenes where he plays a teenage Leonidas practically being unbearable to watch), to just about bearable (I did see a hint of charisma in the Deal or No Deal sketch, just a hint mind you). Maguire just really isn't that talented an actor, or at least he can't show off any talent here because the writers seem to be making the thing up as they go along. Carmen Elektra turns up in her unfortunately extended role. Elektra isn't the best actress ever, and she has made a habit of showing up in these damned movies. Here she is tolerable at times, but generally she is there to look sexy and that's it. Ken Davitian turns up if only to pay for the bills as Xerxes. Okay he's reasonably amusing at times, but her shows up barely at all, and by the time he ends up as a Transformer (seriously don't ask) I just felt sorry for the poor actor. The rest of the cast, oh who cares to be honest. They're all as bad as one another for signing onto this piece of garbage.And here we get to the rest of the bad stuff in Meet the Spartans, brace yourselves as there is a lot. Firstly the humour is way off target. All we get are a series of fart jokes, break dances, pop culture references, and that's it. Britney Spears shows up to be laughed at twice in the movie, a fact I found closer to bullying than funny. The Pit of Death sequence is stupid and not even remotely funny, once you've seen three people kicked in you want to cry, then we get at least another two loads of people kicked in! American Idol shows up way too often, it wasn't funny first time and it certainly isn't the third time! The Simon Cowell being nasty routine is very much out of date, sure he criticises but he just paid of a family's mortgage the other day, so we don't really care about the Americans saying how nasty he is all the time any more. 300 is pretty much recreated scene for scene and also poked fun at scene for scene. Trust me if you liked 300 you will just be furious at this movie. I mean whoever would have guessed 300 was slightly homo-erotic? The sketches on Youtube that appeared at the time 300 was released were funnier than this, so all the stuff we see here has been done before and better! I admit to laughing once, the Happy Feet sketch is kind of funny, that's about it to be honest. The break dancing made me contemplate suicide, and the rest of the stuff left me bored and angry.So here I am, one year later with a new spoof movie to hate for eternity. If you liked Epic Movie, yes there are some of you out there I know, then you may find this a tiny bit amusing. For the sane mortals amongst us however I recommend gouging your eyeballs out with a spoon rather than see this movie!",Meet the Spartans

But that brings in another problem is that after a time, it was the same funny over and over again and it got kinda boring.From the start, I was laughing and it would seem that the slapstick humour that makes the ""movie"" series is thankfully getting better.However the main problem with a film like this is that it is not timeless, and that kinda bums me out. Sketch comedy is funny, and satires of current pop culture is funny. But once you move out of the time that made the references funny, then it doesn't become funny anymore, and later generations will look at it and go ""huh""? Chris Crocker, the three vagina's of Britney, Paris, and Lindsay, and American Idol, will not be relevant 5 years from now.20 years from now, if someone decided to pick this up for rental or Wallyworld Bargain Bin Special, will have no idea what in the world is going on or why it was funny...And that is the problem with todays parodies is that they are too much connected to the time.My wife, Secret Agent J, and myself discussed this during the end credits. What was it that made movies like Spaceballs, Naked Gun, and Airplane funny? Why can a person watch those movies today, and get the same reaction that would have been gotten 30 years ago? It took us a while and it finally dawned on us. The movies stood on their own. Sure Spaceballs was parody of Star Wars, but it didn't follow Star Wars scene for scene. It was it's own movie that took elements of Star Wars and made it into it's own movie.Had I not known about or seen the movie 300, then this movie wouldn't be funny.And that is the problem with modern parodies. They don't take those elements of other movies and make them their own.This movie was nearly scene for scene, 300. It could not have existed without 300. Spaceballs could exist without Starwars. Airplane could have existed without Airport.This is not so much of a review as it is a dissertation of why today's parodies aren't as good as they could be. So I am sorry about that.All and all, this movie will at the very least lift a chuckle, but only if you are up on today's pop culture. If you are reading this review any amount of time in the future (say 5 years), and you haven't seen it, nor are you aware of much of today's current pop culture, then don't waste your time, it wont be funny.",Meet the Spartans

I can start off by saying, it is really not worth seeing again; not only is it bad in it's own right, but my God has it aged badly. Many of the references that might have worked back then were just old and tired this time around - and that was only two years ago. Like I said, this film doesn't just suffers from being dated, it just suffers, period. It has been so crammed full of unfunny, vulgar jokes that repeat in absurdum, that I often found myself wishing they would just stop being ""funny"" and continue with what little plot there was. Naturally, being a spoof that more or less just rips off the original, it has no plot of it's own, it just relies on those jokes, and that's where it FAILS.

Opinion: This is the most painful spoof you'll ever have to sit through in 2008. Every joke is either centered around homosexuality or some gross out gag. This movie mainly spoofs 300 but it takes time to skewer Shrek, Stomp The Yard Spiderman 3 and Happy Feet(why, please tell me why?). You might like this slop if you find the following funny: 1. A penguin pooping in Leonidas's mouth. 2.A bunch of sweaty men dancing to Gloria Gaynor's I Will Survive. 3.Ill-timed gay gags. 4.Everybody getting kicked into the pit of death. 5.Jokes being explained repeatedly. 6.Jokes being spotted a mile away(like the Stomp The Yard scene) Etc. The jokes are predictable and every one of them fall to the ground with a resounding thud like Johny Fairplay(what, too late?). You get the point. Life is too short to waste on another bad spoof. Stick with Airplane, Top Secret, Hot Shots, Naked Gun, Don't Be A Menace, Im Gonna Git U Sucka, Scary Movie(the first one) and every other spoof from the past.

(Which, it didn't even do a good job at that). If you see this movie, you must have a lot of time on your hands. Visaulize laughing at it's one joke, and then have that same joke repeated to you over and over and over again. The remainder is an attempt to tease this years' movies, t.v. shows, the trends, and the irresponsible celebrities that we're so sick of watching in real life. If you want to watch something that makes fun of other movies, watch or re-watch the classics, like Spaceballs or Naked Gun. Those were, and still are, funny. 2 out of 10",Meet the Spartans
89,andell,Terrible...Just Terrible!!!,1,30 January 2008,"Okay, for those who don't know the score, parodies make fun of things that are widely acknowledged in the mainstream of society. Airplane did it. Naked Gun did it. Hot Shots did it. Scary Movie did it.Sadly, so too did ""Meet the Spartans."" The only difference is that the film is so devoid of any creative way to espouse these mock ups that all it does is saturate itself with a bombardment of rip offs.I think the funniest thing in the movie (sorry to give it away) is at the beginning when they're talking about babies. ""If the child is Vietnamese, Brangelina gets first dibs,"" or something like that. That was about all I actually laughed at.The film is pretty tasteless when it comes to its assault on female celebrities. Paris Hilton is deformed, Brittany Spears' unbalanced state is laughed at, and as some have noted, even Anna Nicole Smith is worked into the script...though one would have to wonder why.The Transformers reference didn't make sense (why is the man inside the robot???), the Spiderman reference was stupid, and references to ""American Idol,"" the show with the cases, ""Heroes"" and so on are so pointless in that they've been so overplayed that they barely cause a chuckle.Of course when its not spoofing, it is saturating the film with homosexual jokes, and while I wouldn't call the movie homophobic, I certainly could understand if some people found the film offensive in this regard. And as for the Crabs reference, I actually found myself suppressing a gag reflex over that! YUCK! The film is just plain awful, and when a movie like this can't entertain you for 70 minutes or so, its really, really sad!Oh, and I forgot, the traitor is named ""Traitoro"" or something like that. I guess someone thought this would be a clever reference, but its just bad! Don't see this movie for entertainment purposes- see it to show you what not to do if you ever direct a movie yourself!",Meet the Spartans
90,deadsenator,"What did you expect? Heck, it ain't all bad. - 4 of 10",4,6 February 2008,"I did not begin this film with any high hopes. This is how this type of film should be approached. Cheap humor and gross jokes abound. This is how these films do it and to expect any complex humor is selling the genre short. Yes, there are much better films in the genre, but come on people, you cannot knock it for trying. It does connect on a few jokes and I found it mildly amusing for the the first half, I then started to get a little bored with it and I wandered a little. It's a good thing that it is so short. In fact, it may be too long at 84 minutes! No, it is not Airplane or Naked Gun, but it works a little and you cannot judge these films too seriously. Don't go out of your way, but if it's on, you're likely to get a coupla yucks out of it. I consider a 5 a ""take it or leave it film"", so it just misses that mark. In it's genre, it is a 4 of 10.",Meet the Spartans
91,Theraxorterminate,To give this movie a 0 would be too kind for it's awfulness.,1,10 April 2014,"So it's been 6 years but I'm still mad about this movie's existence. I wish I hadn't seen this, if you are a curious person like me please don't look at this movie. It's using one of the most laziest attempt of humor that don't deliver anything original or even hilarious. OK look there's nothing wrong with parodies but trying to use many other movies in one, putting a lot of tiresome cultural references and use obnoxious toilet humor is not only a disaster of a movie but hard to believe that movies like this get's to be presented in public.Let's face it, the directors Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer are truly HACKS. Even their next parody ""Disaster Movie"" was Godawful and a movie I hated so much I almost stopped watching movies. Sometimes I'm wondering if they ever will learn about their lack of ideas, but I guess they won't since they gave another bad parody movie from last year.But what exactly is wrong with this movie? Well the acting is poor and nothing memorable. The jokes are unbelievably awful and not funny at all. But one thing I hate about this movie is it's art direction and production. It is so idiotically, horrible done for a parody it was almost like watching a bad sketch or even a bad play.I seriously wish a movie like this could be forbidden and stay in oblivion for the rest of it's life. Trust me it is that awful.Is it recommended? I would never in my life recommend this movie for anyone who loves movies or those who loves comedy flicks.

92,EchoMaRinE,not bad at all,5,16 March 2010,"I was looking at the top worst 100 list and saw the name of this movie so I felt the urge to write about it. I watched Meet the Spartans last year and it was funny. It is a comedy and it gives what it promises. I read some of the comments and people are really harsh on it. Come on, it is not a masterpiece for sure but it is not that bad. I am pretty sure a lot of people voted without watching and they voted very low since this is making fun of 300. I personally liked 300, it was a great movie but that doesn't mean you can't make fun of it. Humor is a very difficult subject and I strongly suggest not to get influenced by the comments for comedy movies. Just watch it and see it for yourself. If you don't find it funny, then you just stop watching.",Meet the Spartans
93,moonmonday,"Light and amusing enough, far better than its source material",6,16 June 2008,"The Frank Miller-penned disaster 300 provided the backdrop to many ignorant comments about a thoroughly inaccurate and outright insulting portrayal of the Spartans; as a folklorist and lifelong enthusiast of classical mythology and legend, as well as having an interest in the actual history of the event (or as much as can be determined from what remains), I was appalled not only by the flagrant disregard for even the spirit of the events. But I wasn't surprised. After all, it was Frank Miller. It shouldn't surprise me that 300 was a horrific, homophobic, historically-inaccurate abomination.Then came Meet the Spartans, which admittedly is limited by its source material -- the film 300, along with numerous references to popular culture -- but is amusing enough to pass the time. While it is also brought down by a rather short running time, and a few jokes that hit or miss, the ones that hit are amusing enough to carry through the ones that don't. It's also, ironically, closer to the spirit of the story, despite its silly jokes, than 300 could ever hope to be, with its testosterone-laden homophobia and self-important pretension evident at each and every turn. Meet the Spartans takes all the best instances of that and turns them into wicked comedy, which works as well as it does because of the generally talented cast and amusing setup.That's not to say that everything works equally well. 300 doesn't really give much to work with, and they do manage to parody everything that they can. But some of the things used to fill the time between moments is too dependent on pop culture references, and these aren't always as funny as they could be. Additionally they may not age well, and at some point down the line people may watch this and wonder why certain stretches are actually supposed to be funny, or what they refer to in their many celebrity imitations and so forth.The downbeat ending, unfortunately too-closely mirroring 300's own, also started to wind down the film and wasn't able to pick it up until a hilariously outrageous sequence during the credits, which do pick up the mood considerably and had me laughing again before I knew it.Overall, however, this blows 300 and other equally pretentious and overblown films out of the water. It's certainly fun for a casual viewing, and the extras on the DVD really make it worth picking up, because there's a lot of them, and they're enjoyable. This isn't really some kind of deeply intellectual fare, naturally, but it's a lot of fun if one approaches it with the mindset that it's just simple, mindless fun -- something 300 should've been, but wasn't even close to being, and instead it tried to be some kind of historical put-on. Meet the Spartans wisely eschews the pretension and just unabashedly brings on relentless silliness, and in my opinion it's certainly enjoyable enough for a rental, if nothing else.",Meet the Spartans
94,Red_Flag,Behold the worst film ever made. The Spartans would make short work of them.,1,8 June 2008,"Well if were being honest what did you expect? Did you guys expect this to be any better than Date movie or even Epic Movie? No meet the Spartans manages to be significantly worse than both of those films combined. Parodying epic films 300, Transformers and err Happy Feet? This is only for those who are deeply dedicated to this long dead series and car crash cinema enthusiasts.I don't know how my brain allowed me to see this picture. I thought it would be like trying to suffocate yourself; your body would just shut down before you could do it. Apparently I was wrong. I sat through this movie and laughed once, and that was during the preview for another movie. There was the odd part where I might have cracked a smile or thought, ""This might be funny if..."" but there is a very good reason for that. Instead of making good jokes and thoughtful humor, the writers decided to just constantly send an endless stream of jokes at you and hoped one of them made you chuckle.From the creators of Scary Movie and Date Movie comes this tongue-in-cheek parody of the sword-and-sandal epics, dubbed Meet the Spartans. The 20th Century Fox production was written and directed by the film-making team of Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer.Sure, Leonidas may have nothing more than a cape and some leather underwear to protect him from the razor-sharp swords of his Persian enemies, but that won't stop the brave leader and his team of 13 warriors from defending their beloved homeland against a powerful invading force that includes the likes of a mutant Paris Hilton, the Transformers, the Ghost Rider, and Rocky Balboa.The much-discussed homo eroticism of Snyder's epic predictably is played for laughs here. (The Spartans are a campy group of guys who march -- or, more precisely, skip -- to a disco beat.) But after the 10th or 20th repetition of a gag about Leonidas' leather underpants and the other scantily-clad Spartans -- a gag that isn't terribly funny the first time -- even the more virulent homophobes in the audience likely will respond with groans, not giggles.The unmistakable air of desperation hangs heavily over the entire production, as the filmmakers repeatedly resort to introducing celebrity lookalikes -- doubles for Britney Spears, Tom Cruise, George Bush, the cast of ""American Idol"" -- as nothing more than walking-and-talking punch lines.It's reflective of the pic's insubstantially and slapdash construction that, shortly after the closing credits begin to roll at the 65-minute mark, the filmmakers introduce deleted scenes -- not outtakes but snippets obviously trimmed in the editing room -- without any regard for continuity or coherence. It's as though they figured that, what the hell, they went to the trouble and expense of shooting this stuff, and, by God, they were going to use it.My final Verdict? Avoid at all costs. Meet the Spartans is probably the worst film ever made.",Meet the Spartans

96,RichardKleiner,One spoof too many!,1,29 February 2008,"There are several kinds of stupidity in comedy. We can have the classic effortless yet very funny stupid movies (Happy Gilmore). We also have frat-house stupid movies, that sometimes fall into the gross-out genre, but overall have something memorable (Animal House, American Pie). There is also a kind of stupidity that is beyond definition that still makes you laugh (Jackass, One and Two). And, of course, there is the incompetent stupidity from such filmmakers like Ed Wood or Coleman Francis that makes those beloved ""so bad, it's good movies"".However, we have never seen stupidity in its primal form. Pure, 100 %, basic and right into the core of everything stupid. Even with all the above mentioned movies, a shred of intelligence was put into them. Still, we haven't seen a complete work of mindless, thoughtless and just pure stupidity. Not until ""Meet the Spartans"".OK. I exaggerated. There was some thought put into the concept of this moving images (I dare not to call it movie). Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg did use their brains for such questions like ""What is a spoof?"" ""what is a movie?"", ""what movies can we spoof?"", ""how we can make movies as visually identical to the original, yet keep our film school project budget"".Then, it all just went downhill. It's horrific to just think about it. Acting? Script? Directing? Production values? Creativity? Something? Anything? Now, apparently, as I remember, a spoof consists of imitating a movie and make fun of some of their aspects. So, where is it? Oh, sorry. there were only lame pop-culture references and a lot of remarks saying ""this is funny"" or ""we are parodying recent epic movies, didn't you notice?"", literally, in plain English.Hey, I got news for you. This spoofing _____ Movie thing is now officially old. ""Date Movie"" was the sign. ""Epic Movie"" was the ultimatum. ""Meet the Spartans"" is the fulfillment. No more spoof movies by Seltzer and Friedberg, whose careers have been defined by ""writing"" ""scripts"" for such ""movies"" as ""Spy Hard"" and ""Scary Movie"" (their only real success which I thought was also trash).Now, the reason why these spoofs are not actually that clever to make is because they're limited to the referenced movies' impact and popularity. Most of the films parodied are forgettable, as so is this one. While you can have some timeless comedy classics, all of Charlie Chaplin's or Laurel and Hardy's films, when you have a spoof, it's just funny for a limited time. No one will remember spoofs from several years on (most especially this one).I was almost having a heart attack when I read Christopher Lennertz's name in the credits. After composing some of the most outstanding and beautiful scores for a video game series (Medal of Honor), you decide to sign up for this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It looks like Giacchino taking over Airborne really must have hit you bad.Now, a recommendation to all of you readers and moviegoers. When you have the choice of watching ""Meet the Spartans"" or being thrown off a pit, it's more than obvious that you will choose the pit. But there is also another choice. A light at the end of the tunnel. It's called ""watching something else"". Don't give those jackasses that call themselves writers to keep, first, butchering every single one of your favorite movies, second, wasting your time, money and attention and, third, making you fell emotionally sick, mentally raped and intellectually insulted with this piece of CRAP! Oh, and it might help if you see some real spoof comedies, like ""Airplane"" or ""The Naked Gun"".",Meet the Spartans
97,windypoplar,meet the funny!,6,17 June 2008,"I like my comedies stupid, ""Meet the Spartans"" more than delivers. It makes no bones about being a parody of all and everything the filmmakers could think of. Mostly it pokes juvenile fun at the excellent but highly stylized ""300"". Here Leonidas, played to the hilt by Sean McGuire, leads a rag-tag bunch of 13, thats right 13!, Spartans against insurmountable Persians.But who cares? It's the sight gags and corny humor we all tuned in for! McGuire is added by Kevin Sorbo of Hercules fame as his captain. Sorbo is so good here, why doesn't this guy get more good roles? Carmen Electra, naturally, is on hand to lend some sex appeal. Nicole PAker of MAd TV plays no less than five roles and if you don't laugh and her dead-on Paula Abdul imitation there's something wrong with you.I laughed out loud at most of this blissfully short spoof, but my favorite sequence was the rank session with the hi-hop Persians. Funny! Lines like, ""Your Momma is such a sloppy drunk, I thought she was David Hasslehoff!"" are just righteously funny. Deidrich Bader is a hoot as Traitorus, Get it? and the rather obvious jokes about the Spartans latent homosexuality are so dead-on that you have to laugh, love the Budweiser parody!! Meet the Spartans ain't Shakespeare folks, its not supposed to be. Sure it could have been better, but its right up there with Epic Movie and Not Antoher Teen Movie as very funny. Plus guys there is one outrageous shot of Queen Margo (Carmen) that you have to see to believe! I mean my jaw hit to floor!

You definitely need to have seen 300 to enjoy this to the fullest. Or maybe because it is a different type of comedy. MTS pokes fun at a lot of things going on today, other movies, including itself, and it does it VERY well. The only reason I don't give this a 10 is because I'm damn sure it won't age well at all.Forget all the so-called 'comedies' that came before. The Scary Movie series is based around the same nonsense principle, but it fails in too many areas to be funny throughout. Meet The Spartans is different, there's a gag going on every 3 seconds, so there's always something to laugh at.Most of the jokes are obvious, but there are some very subtle ones that you might not get at first. There's even some Monty Python touches here and there. This movie is VERY silly and proud of it.As a comedy Meet The Spartans succeeds in every level. Even the small budget helps and is turned into a joke. Nothing is sacred, and I like my comedies that way.Don't listen to the haters, I suspect they have no sense of humor.

That said, the theater was packed with teenagers who were delighted with the movie - I did not hear one negative comment - they loved it! The only positive thing I could see revolved around the performances by the MAD TV performers, Ike Barinholz, Crista Flanagan and Nicole Parker who did characters they had created from the show that were still funny, even amidst this mess. I also liked looking at a scantily clad Carmen Electra - but I needed desperately to find something I liked. This was so bad it was not even bad/good.

I was even more delighted when I saw the trailer. All too often comedy movie trailers contain all the best jokes, leaving nothing funny for the actual movie. I knew this movie was going to be great when I saw the trailer and there wasn't ONE FUNNY BIT IN IT!!!!! Clearly these were film makers who did not need to advertise their greatness, as they could rely on their genius to advertise itself. I knew we were going to experience a comedy masterpiece on par with ""Diff'rent Strokes"", ""Australia's Funniest Home Videos"" or Michael Jackson's cosmetic surgery.I set up camp outside the box office 2 days before tickets went on sale to be sure we got the first tickets accompanied, after a sound thrashing, by my wife and my little boy. For two days and nights we struggled on that lonely sidewalk against hunger and thirst and heat and exposure, and towards the end we had to resort to drinking our own urine. But it was worth it, because when ""Meet the Spartans"" finally opened we were the only people in the cinema.And what a movie it was! My own memories are a little hazy given the addled state I was in after two days in the street. For my own part, I was laughing and hollering too much at the little purple animals floating around in the cinema to notice much of the movie. I do remember bits of the trailer getting repeated over and over again, but that must have been the hallucinations as well. However I do remember my wife and my little boy found it so funny they were too astonished to laugh. After a while the exertions of the previous 2 days took their toll and they fell asleep with their precious heads lolling into my unwashed groin. But shoot, I wasn't complaining :-) All in all it was probably the greatest day of my life, and perhaps anyone's life.I was delighted to learn that there was a ""Meet the Spartans 2"". If there was one film crying out for a sequel, it must surely be this one. As with ""Weekend at Bernie's"", you just got the feeling that one movie was not enough to fully explore the vast richness of ideas on display.

Well, for those that were utterly disgusted by Date Movie and Epic Movie, there's nothing in Meet the Spartans that's going to make you feel any different.

The CGI is good, Gerard Butler is good, but the film is pants and very repetitive. Actually, Meet the Spartans made me smirk possibly once, maybe twice, actually possibly three times however for approximately an hour and a half, it is a dire movie made by catastrophic directors.Sean McGuire is an amateurish actor at best while Carmen Electra is rather irritating. Awful casting doesn't bed well with few laughable lines, no story, no originality and certainly no entertainment.'300' is a parody in itself and probably the more sensible selection of the two for a Friday night popcorn flick. At least there are rare flashes of entertainment to be shared with the bloody action flick through the amazing usage of CGI and imagery to capture the atmosphere of war. Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer are possibly the most cataclysmic set of directors ever to form a feature length film.

First of all, if you were suckered or tricked into seeing the 300 (of which Meet the Spartans is heavily based on) and you didn't like it, then Meet the Spartans is totally for you.There were several reasons that I didn't like the 300. Don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of Frank Miller and respect his artistic expression. This is, of course, one of the reasons that I went to go see the 300 in the first place. However, I was expecting to see a comic book adaptation (of which the 300 was), but wasn't expecting to see all the seriousness and homo erotica references that the movie had or at least was leaning towards.It's nice to know that I'm not the only one who felt the same way. Apparently the writers of Meet the Spartans felt the same and managed to come up with a script that pokes fun (pun intended) of the 300 and all it's homo eroticism, as well as modern day pop culture.The jokes were on cue, really funny and not over the top or even forced. Whereas the 300 alluded to homosexuality, Meet the Spartans throws it in your face in a very witty, nonsexual and funny way.You'll laugh, cringe, laugh some more and then think, ""they aren't going to go there.""

109,stewiefan201,Meet the Spartans represents everything that's wrong with our society.,1,25 January 2008,"Meet the Spartans is a parody of 300. It is basically just a parody of the plot, setting, battles, and characters of 300. That is all you need to know.These spoof parody films keep making money off of idiot kids who go see them. I have seen the Scary Movie films and they were decent mindless fun. At least they found semi-creative ways to make you laugh, although by number 4 it was way over the top. I never watched Epic Movie or Date Movie because many said they were painfully bad. However today I went to go see Meet the Spartans with a friend.Let me start off, Meet the Spartans is bad movie...a very bad movie! There are zero moments in this dreadful comedy that are creative or very laugh-inducing, unless your a teenager, or younger, with the humor of an 8 year old. I will admit there are a few little subtle jokes that made me crack a smile. But about 98% of the movie is filled with over-the-top gags. However there are not as many gross-out gags as other spoof movies tend to be filled with. But believe me that does little justice for this horrendous parody film.The semi funny scenes involve a Stomp the Yard montage which actually is decently chuckle worthy. There is another little scene that involves Budweiser beer which I may have emitted a laugh at. The subtle jokes involved the Spartans skipping all over the place while holding hands. However all the other jokes go way over the top, and ruin anything ""Funny"" (Bunny ears) about them. For instance there is a scene where Ghost Rider is parodied for about 20 seconds, and there is nothing remotely funny about it. The acting and script were atrocious as I, and everyone else, expected. The visuals were also obviously just a cheap looking movie set.The only thing good I can say about Meet the Spartans is at least it is more focused on the 300 spoof, rather than making fun of 50 movies packed into one film. Now for the big spoiler, here is everything Meet the Spartans parodied: 300, Shrek 3, Spider Man 3, Britney Spears, Paris Hilton, Stomp the Yard, Budweiser beer, Gatorade commercials, Sanjaya, American Idol, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, Happy Feet, Transformers, Chris Crocker, Grand Theft Auto, Ghost Rider, Deal Or No Deal, Kevin Federline, and the last I can remember is that show Yo Mama.At 65 minutes long without credits this film is not at all worth 10 dollars for a ticket. It barely even delivers on what it promises you...laughs! The most irritating thing about the movie is not even the lame jokes, it's the pop culture references. Enough of these pop culture references, they are what exposes this movie's horrible script. I give Meet the Spartans a Zero out of 4. I was tame during this review too, I could have let loose on it but I kept my cool. Bottom Line: Do Not See This Pick-Pocketing Movie!",Meet the Spartans
110,I_saw_it_happen,The Worst Attempt at Comedy I have Ever Seen,1,9 June 2008,"I only saw the first twenty minutes of this movie before I determined I simply didn't want to waste any more of my life on it. This film was essentially a collection of pop culture references and genitalia jokes, repeated over and over again. In no way does it make sense. At the point where a giant penguin jumps in the air, is wedged between two rocks and, for no apparent reason whatsoever, starts cursing that 'my ass hurts!', it became apparent that context didn't even matter to the writers. Simply hurtling around profanity and referencing testicles ever few seconds doesn't seem like entertainment to me. I doubt anyone expected this movie to be good. But it should have been at least watchable. The only vaguely funny part I could recall was a running theme of (heavy handed) insinuation that the Spartans were 'gay'. This obvious joke wore itself out after the first ten minutes of overuse.It even feels like a waste of time reviewing it. Don't waste your time watching it.",Meet the Spartans

This a good spoof comedy worth at least six stars. If you see a review giving it one to three stars then you have to realize these are not good people. They are uptight morons with absolutely no sense of humour and no common decency.
When you go to a theater to see a pantomime like Cinderella or Jack And The Beanstalk, etc, you know you're going to get a well acted production that follows the main story but with loads of zany pop culture and comedic extras thrown in - and this is exactly like that. It's a pantomime of 300 that keeps to the main story of the Spartans but incorporates loads of campy madness and fun around it. It's not really laugh out loud funny (maybe in one or two places) but it is entertaining and it is very well done. I will say, though, that you may not want to eat your dinner while watching this.",Meet the Spartans

The over the top sluttiness of Carmen's character? The repeating fixation on gay innuendos? The lack of a coherent storyline? Maybe the ridiculous dance sequences? Well rather than boring you with the details, let's just say this movie is terrible. Bad acting, bad story, bad effects (I think this part was on purpose). BAD! BAD! BAD! While there were a few chuckles, for the most part, I tuned out. For this, you may argue that I didn't watch the entire movie and shouldn't comment on it. I counter that argument by saying that only a masochist will subject themselves to every minute of this movie.",Meet the Spartans
113,the_headless_cross,"Some funny parts, but no heart",5,9 June 2008,"This is probably the nicest review for this movie ever. Kinda sad.I love parody movies. I will admit, I am of the very very very few that liked Epic Movie. And even when people were saying how terrible Meet The Spartans looked I still wanted to see it. Well, just kinda disappointed in what I saw.First off, the running time. An hour? And that is not counting the ""deleted"" scenes in the ending credits! They allowed an hour long movie? The running time not only makes you feel cheated, but it also shows at one point, the writers and directors said ""Oh crap. We've run out of movies to spoof and celebrities to make fun of. Better call it a movie.""And what is with the recent trend of these parody movies? C'mon, we had enough jokes about Paris, Britney and American Idol in Date Movie and Epic Movie! Look for some new material! Sadly, this should have been called ""Pop Culture Movie."" And it will be forgotten in 10 years while the things they make fun of fade away. That's why true spoof movies spoof timeless classics (Spaceballs, for the win).And we are aware of what movies you are spoofing too. What the heck? ""...just like Tobey Maguire did in Spiderman 3."" Who's narrating this film? John Madden?Still I gotta admit, some scenes did get a laugh from me. But unfortunately most of those were shown in the commercials/previews, such as the Rambo scene (which was shown at the end of the movie, just slapped in there randomly). And of course, Carmen Electra is always easy on the eyes for sure. One scene with her made me hungry for pizza (those who've seen this will know what I mean). Oh and the actress who plays both Britney and Paris? Way hotter than the both of them will ever be!So overall I cannot declare this a spoof movie, rather a quickly rushed mix of 300 and everything that is big in pop culture. Want a better one? The Scary Movies are pretty good, and the recently released Superhero Movie knows what to do. Or if you want classic spoofs, rent Spaceballs and the Naked Gun movies.",Meet the Spartans
114,garretsr,They phoned this script in,4,28 January 2008,"I think the spoof comedy movie genre needs a bit of a rest. With multiple movies of this type coming out every year, there is just nothing new or funny. Seltzer and Friedberg have done one a year for the last three years (2 in 2006 if you count ""Date Movie"") and just update the tired old jokes to fit with a new set of ""current"" movies.That's not to say the movie was without it's moments, there were funny scenes throughout, but even when a scened was funny, they didn't know how to end it and move-on. For example, the spoof of the ""dance-off"" movies goes on forever, and there's only one joke. They couldn't even fill an hour and a half. My recommendation, if you haven't seen it, wait until it is on HBO or something where you don't have to pay extra.",Meet the Spartans

From the sounds of it, at least the cast had a ball making the movie, so I'm glad at least some people got to enjoy it.There really is very little to recommend here, as even the ""Casino Royale"", ""Spiderman 3"", ""American Idol"" and ""Happy Feet"" send-ups are pathetically devoid of any intelligent input. You see every gag coming from a mile away, and it almost always involves testicles, boobs or some crack about Spartans being gay. The producers should have spent more money on quality comedy writers, instead of wasting all the funding on securing I've-almost-made-it TV actors on vacation from their real jobs. I'm particularly embarrassed for Diederich Bader, whose pedigree is much better than this.In this Little League genre of spoofs, the Wayans brothers' ""Scary Movie"" franchise, ""Not Another Teen Movie"" and the intro sequence to probably every year's MTV Movie Awards since 2001 are the leading contenders.

Direct to video would have been too good for it, much less a national release. Everyone who goes to this film is going to feel ripped-off, as I certainly do. And it's not just the money. I wanted to be entertained. Instead I'm irritated.In the future I am going to look for the names of the two ""creators"" of this film and definitely NOT go to anything they touch.

Did I say jokes? I suppose they were made to be funny, but the only way my lips moved was into a frown. In the first part of the movie there's a scene that sets the expectations for the rest of the movie. Leonidas is trying to survive in the wild when he meets a talking penguin that attacks him, poops on him and makes Leonidas lick ... Just no. The pooping is painful enough to remember. The only thing that was funny was when they painted the abs on with color. Because that was one of the few jokes that had no modern day reference.

The incessant homosexual actions, comments and connotations were just completely revolting and unbelievable, those who produced this horrible monster must all be extreme deviant homosexuals - hardcore.

Actors perform their material well. There are a number of funny bits in this film, but it falls short of ranking as a great spoof. The primary reason is it strayed too frequently from the genre represented by ""300."" Think of a great spoof, like ""Airplane."" It had great bits taken from the Airport series of films as well as the classic from the 50's, ""The High and the Mighty."" Meet the Spartans might have turned out better if they had stuck to ""300"" and films like ""Alexander,"" ""Troy,"" and others of the genre. Instead, they branched out in all directions including TV shows and personalities. In the final analysis, they only had enough good material for a skit on Saturday Night Live. The rest was filler.

I don't know, but even a heroin-addicted monkey would think twice about green-lighting this piece of garbage.The plot is exactly the same as 300, only it seems to have been re-written by a 6th grader with a brain injury. It's listed as a comedy, but I'm convinced that it isn't. Comedies are supposed to have jokes, but this movie really only has references. Lines like ""hey, it's the penguin from Happy Feet"" or ""hey, it's the fat guy from Borat"" aren't jokes. They are statements, not clever or ironic in any way.This movie is also listed as being 82 minutes long, but it is thankfully only about 60 minutes long (the last 22 minutes are credits, bloopers, and deleted scenes). But even the 60 minutes seemed like it dragged on for days. This is mostly because the ""jokes"" dragged on and on - take, for example, the 10 minute scene where Leonidas pushes fake-celebrity after fake-celebrity into a pit; it wasn't even close to funny the first time, yet you have to watch the same bit done over and over again.I don't even want to get into the overwhelming and shameless product placement.If you watch this movie, expect to yawn, groan, and check your watch every 30 seconds, but DO NOT expect to laugh - not even once.",Meet the Spartans

My advice, get a few beers and watch with your girl friend or drunken buddies.There may have been a few too many gay references, but over all I though it was funny the whole macho/homo-ness of the Spartans and how they tried to be tough yet in touch with there feminine side.

As for the reviewer who said this movie didn't have a plot?!?Getting that off my chest, I found this film to be entertaining for the most part. The production quality was high and they captured the essence of the special effects featured in ""300"" quite admirably. Of course, some jokes fell flat, the gay references got a little old, and the dance sequence was about 45 seconds too long, but overall I laughed more than 10 times and chuckled at least twice that many times. The spray painting scene with the abs was classic along with show-casing Paris Hilton as the ogre. The American Idol references were also humorous. I'm sure everyone who watches this will say ""if would have been funnier if...,"" but you're never going to achieve perfection for everyone in this genre.

Now I must agree that the creators decided to explain every premise of every punchline leading me to believe they wrote this thing with morons in mind but a couple of the bits (the different greetings for men and women Spartans) will hold up through the years. Many segments will not hold up as they used a lot of modern culture shock news for parody- like the little freak crying about Brittney (does anyone find him funny?? now let alone 10 years from now) In fact too often the film takes a bad joke and beats it into the ground as in the Stomp the yard/ You've been Served parody. Many actors were from Mad T.V. rehashing their impersonations of celebrities and did a wonderful job in almost every scene. The problem really was the script needed a Babaloo Mandel to tighten it up.

It's the same old slapstick and body excrement jokes that get old faster than a speeding bullet. I saw absolutely no point to this whatsoever, and I was only interested in seeing it because of the Britney jokes they showed on the ads, and I will say I used to be a Britney fan and love making fun of her. Shame I forgot Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg's idea of ""parody"" is redoing a scene from a movie verbatim with actors who look like the actors in the film they are parodying and putting WAY BELOW sub-par dick/fart/crap/boob/sex jokes in and they call it a parody. A parody is something that makes fun of something for a REASON and with A POINT. The Scary Movie movie sorta had this, saying how silly scary movies were, but the sequels, though guilty pleasures of mine, are pointless, though less pointless, than this. And Date Movie and Epic Movie (I preferred the latter over the former) are dick and fart joke movies but I enjoyed them and they are very silly and stupid, but now that I've sorta really grasped what makes a quality movie...I'm saying that this is the most POINTLESS waste of celluloid ever, and I'm really lenient when it comes to films.But this is just stupid beyond belief.

Although all signs point towards this movie being a steaming pile of crud, I tried to watch it with an open mind and without any biases.What comes as no surprise is that ""Meet the Spartans"" is indeed bad. Not only is it not funny, but this time it doesn't even seem like they tried. With ""Date Movie"" and ""Epic Movie"", you could see that the directors did make an attempt at making a good spoof and just failed miserably. Here they didn't even try. The numerous technical errors and goofs throughout the movie are way too many in number for a Hollywood production. On three separate occasions I noticed different characters voices being heard, even though their mouths weren't moving! As well, several of the costumes look like they have been picked up at Wal Mart (the penguin is literally just a guy in a Halloween costume). The biggest insult was when a dwarf was used as a body double for a small child and it was not intended as a joke. How dumb do these guys think we are? The movie's already not funny, the least they could do is make sure there aren't so many blatant screw-ups.This movie does manage to be slightly funnier than the directors' previous attempts, meaning there are about three laughs in total throughout the film. Most of the jokes consist of references to different pop culture icons and celebrities, as if having people do impersonations of famous people is supposed to be funny. The filmmakers even have the gall to ridicule Dane Cook and suggest his comedy routines aren't funny. I'm no fan of Dane Cook, but ""Meet the Spartans"" makes his stuff look like ""Monty Python"".The rest of the jokes either consist of gross-out gags (a bird pooping in a man's face, a man getting kitty litter stuck on his face) or random humor that fails to be funny, even in a random/stupid sort of way (Rocky Balboa wearing a diaper, Paris Hilton fighting the Spartans). The few funny scenes in the movie are the ones directly parodying ""300"". The movie manages to get a couple of laughs by mocking 300's homo-erotic tone, but the gag gets repeated far too many times by the end of the movie.I think I laughed once or twice during the movie, and definitely no more than four times. This is very bad for a movie that has an average of at least one joke every 20 seconds. I advise highly that nobody see this movie or support it (I saw it for free; I would never pay money). It's simply not funny and it would be a waste of money and time for anyone to see it. While I don't think it's as bad as ""Epic Movie"", it's still worse than ""Date Movie"", and that's pretty damn bad!",Meet the Spartans
142,Lammasuswatch,"Truly, truly, excruciatingly awful",1,11 April 2014,"What can I say? How can a film be so unbelievably bad as this one is?Like other films in this franchise, ""Meet the Spartans"" was supposed to be a spoof on a particular film, with references to other movies or cultural references thrown in. In this case, the spoof object was ""300"", a cult film for some, a tedious pop video for others. I thought, just maybe ""Meet the Spartans"" may be more palatable than the pretentious ""300"", with some humorous spoofing added to the formula. I could not have been more wrong! ""300"" made its antecedent ""300 Spartans"" look like multi Academy Award material. And ""Meet the Spartans"" made ""300"" look like high art - a feat in itself!I didn't laugh a single time. I think laughing was supposed to be the point of it, but who knows? Indeed the thought processes, maturity, film-making skill and sense of direction of whoever was ultimately responsible for this dog's breakfast of a movie are not something I would like to investigate closely.In a film in which nothing could be said to be a high point, the really lowest point was an extended rap dancing sequence. (Don't bother asking what rap dancing was doing in this film!) This was an exercise in endurance - it just kept going on - and on - and on. And this sequence probably took up a tenth of the whole hour or so of storyline running time. Or it seemed like it did. But, I hear you say, the movie goes for 86 minutes! Well, after the end of the actual film storyline, the viewer gets to see (apparently all) the out-takes for another interminable period. Were these deemed too funny to be put in the film, or too unfunny, or too irrelevant? Your guess is as good as mine. The editor must have been barkingly high or dead drunk to have got through putting this film together.All I can say in conclusion is thank God I saw this film after taping it from free-to air television so I could watch it later. It allowed me to fast-forward past bits that got just too painful, and it meant that I never had to waste actual money on it. (Although I feel like sending the distributors a bill for my time spent and electricity expended, with an extra loading for having to work with noxious materials!) Not recommended! An outstanding candidate for the worst film I have ever seen. While the earlier movies in this franchise were often quite entertaining, the franchise is now clearly dead, and should be quietly buried for public health reasons.",Meet the Spartans

Basically the plot of 300.I'm going to be honest with everybody. I liked Date Movie, and I liked Epic movie more. I wouldn't say they're the best parodies in the world, but they're the parodies that made me laugh the most. So I kind of like Epic movie and Date movie. They definitely wouldn't make my list of top movies, but would probably be somewhere halfway between the middle and bottom.So when I heard that Meet the Spartans was coming out made by the same people who made Epic and Date movie, I was kind of excited. I knew it wasn't going to be a good movie, but it'll make me laugh a lot. But when I saw Meet the Spartans, I was greatly, greatly, greatly, greatly disappointed. I knew it was going to be a crappy movie, but I expected to laugh during the movie. There wasn't a single moment where I actually laughed. And there was only a few times where I chuckled.I would recommend Epic and Date movie because it can give you some cheap laughs. I wouldn't recommend Meet the Spartans to my worst enemy.

It is very possible to reference/spoof current films or popular culture well I'm sure, but as far as the ""... movie"" type series goes, they should honestly stop now.Not only was this film awful in itself, but it managed to spectacularly and ruthlessly ruin one of the really good film moments of recent years. I refer to the ""THIS IS SPARTA!"" scene in 300. They plugged the joke to death and further. Just when you thought that was the last unamusing pop culture reference he was going to kick down that hole NO! another one appears to drag on the hopelessly pathetic gag for another minute or two.The straw that broke the camels back though, was the dance off scene against the ""immortals"".

Apparently they've missed the fact that the movie has been sitting at number one since it debuted. I recall checking the ratings here a few days ago and wondering to myself, how the hell can a movie thats been sitting at number one for weeks be so bad? So I went and saw it and what do you know, it's absolutely hilarious from start to finish. I mean this movie is so funny my face hurt after seeing it. Yes it's brain dead, no there's not really a plot and yes it's offensive as hell to anyone who can be offended. Of course, thats why it's so funny and thats exactly what the film makers intended. Movies like Airplane, Scary Movie, Epic Movie, Walk Hard and Meet The Spartans are intended to poke, prod, repulse and make you laugh. If they weren't made in the fashion they are then they wouldn't be funny. I literally did not stop smiling or laughing once during this entire film, except when I had to turn my head and cover my mouth because of some particularly disgusting scene. I might point out though that I pretty much had to close my eyes during the ""bush"" trimming scene in Scary Movie...but thats another story.If you enjoy parody films, you can deal with being offended and repulsed or you are the type thats not offended by anything then go see this movie and get ready to laugh yourself into the hospital. If your easily offended, you should probably skip this and check out Cloverfield or 27 Dresses, you'll be happier and you won't have to look back on this film in disgust.",Meet the Spartans

Overall it was a funny movie, made fun of Britney and the fact that she doesn't take care of her children, and poked fun at Donald trump. Of course, Carmen Electra is back.. is this the only kind of movies she can do? Movies that poke fun at her, and stereotype her. LAME. But personal preference.

There were funny parts and there were so-insulting-it's-not-funny parts. Here is my review for Meet The Spartans: Plot: All you need to know is that this is a parody of 300 (the main plot) with movies like Spider-Man 3, Ghost Rider and Transformers (for which I've written a review already). Show parodies of American Idol and other parodies like You Tube are in here too. There are funny parts to it, but not a lot of them-7/10 Cast: There are a few familiar faces in this movie- Carmen Electra (Epic Movie, Cheaper by the dozen 2, etc.) and Ken Davitian (Borat no less). Other then that, the cast is pretty much new to movies, but do a good job nonetheless- 6/10 Jokes: Because there's not enough SFX in this movie, I'm replacing it with jokes. You see, there were good jokes (the Bond scene, the blue screen gag, the GTA Parody, I will survive and a couple more) Jokes that didn't make too much sense, but were good nevertheless (the opening scene, The yo mama fight, Xerxestron and a few others) and some, just plain bad altogether (the deleted scenes, the Mumble/Leonidas fight, the ending *excluding the song that is* and the trailers before the movie *well duh* among others)- 8/10 Overall: I liked this movie, the cast did their best. the jokes kept coming (although some didn't make sense or were pretty bad).

I had thought about not taking her, but she pestered me for 2 weeks to go on opening night. Plus she had a friend with her. This is a PG-13 rated movie that should have been rated R. I sat in anothe row with my girlfriend and was really squirming in my seat the entire time. It is full of homosexual jokes from beginning to end and they weighed the movie down beyond description. Carmen Electra was abysmal and I pray to God that I never have to see that fat guy from ""Borat"" scantily clad ever again. It's just overkill. There was also enough product placement that the producers probably were able to raise the entire budget from corporate sponsorship.

151,berryj6,"A cheap, lazy comedy where the jokes bear a good resemblance to a broken record.",2,14 September 2008,"Meet the Spartans is a parody of the linear 300 (see my 300 review). From the opening of the film the audience is blasted with a thick array of jokes. Unfortunately, when the jokes are bad, (which far too many are), it hurts far too badly, and not even the somewhat hilarious 'training scene' can lift this spoof up from the 'pit of death' from which it has been kicked into. Its a tale of 'Ther Slightly Good, The Bad and The Worse As a majority of the audience is aware, 300 was about half-naked men with big abs and six packs who fight CGI monsters. So, Meet the Spartans is about men with big abs who are happy and slightly homosexual. However, this 'easy' and 'lazy' humour is tediously repeated throughout all 84 minutes of the film. So is the product placement, which is worn out to death. There is no unique, sharp of witty humour in Meet the Spartans. There is even Carmen Electra, who is easily the funniest due to her convincing sexy role.Meet the Spartans is a one-trick pony. By the end of the film, where they do the talent show scene for the FOURTH time, you are left with almost no memorable quotes, funny scenes or engaging celebrity-posers.

Nothing thats gonna make you remember it longer than 4 seconds but there are a few, funny moments. Very few.

EVERY SCENE depicts in some form or another, and often distasteful gay related joke. I also must add the whole pit of death scene is early funny but horribly ruined in the same fashion a comedian gets a small laugh fromt he audience and over runs with a skit.

It's OK though, don't be upset, like every genre it will resurrect itself in time, with a glossy new appearance and a brand new generation of audience. But before we bury the corpse, let's just take one last look at the body to try to examine the cause of death and who the perpetrators of this heinous crime were.Hmmm, yes....if you look closely, there are definite signs of strangulation in the script. Every single gross-out event of the last 12 months was squeezed and throttled into a tight 60 minutes. The ""jokes"" were delivered like bullets from a Gatling gun and every one missed their target, because we could all see them coming from 50 miles away.But the real cause of death was old age and neglect. Everyone associated with this movie is equally guilty of flogging this old horse to death and they knew it. The movie started out reasonably creatively, with a spoof of Casino Royale, but then it gave up and just played out the 300 storyline. The scriptwriters knew it was all over and just gave up. The running time of 60 minutes is proof of their guilt.Almost to their credit the actors (if indeed that's what they were) seemed embarrassed by their role in this crime, but to their shame, they will not be able to avoid charges of aiding and abetting.The budget for this movie must have been around $30 plus change. All shot in one studio stage, ""actors"" playing dual roles, no location shots, pitiful CGI, stupendously awful make up, props and sets, seemingly borrowed from Plan 9 from Outer Space.When they viewed the rushes, the Producers could see that their fingerprints were all over the body and decided not to show it to the critics, but rather release it directly to the paying public under a veil of hype, which they hoped would be their alibi.

It goes a long way to prove how bad the comedies of this generation can go, and people will still probably watch it. It is an insult to the spoof genre, and believe me, it makes Epic Movie look much better.Firstly, there is no comedy at all. What the writers have tried to do is try to cram in every reference to a pop culture element of the modern times into the movie, regardless whether it suits the scenes or not. It leads to sad and painfully unfunny random references like :The Pit of Death: Britney Spears, K-Fed, and even Sanjaya randomly appear into the movie and get kicked into the pit. American Idol judges comment on Leonidas' kick Sparta's Next Top Model judges a Spartan Xerxes playing Deal or No Deal with the Spartans Leonidas in Grand Theft Auto: Hot Gates Paris Hilton as the hunchback traitor (!?) Xerxes turning into a transformer Ugly Betty as the oracle Carmen Electra (Queen) turning into Venom and Traitora turning into Sandman Other painful references to Ghost Rider, Rocky, Rambo, Dancing with the Spartans, Stomp the Yard, Shrek, Lindsay Lohan's rehab, popular Youtube videos and more.Also, the movie relies primarily on a one-joke gag on the implies homosexuality of the 300 Spartans, which we have already heard before, and it is stretched to such a limit in this movie that it is bland and annoying. The cast tries very hard to make something out of the movie, but miserably fails due to the god-awful scripting. The movie starts lame and ends on a lamer note.Overall, do your best to avoid this movie, unless you are a director who needs to see all the ingredients of a bad comedy to avoid.

It's quiet possible there is or will be a movie worse than this, but i've never seen such garbage in my life. None of the characters or actors are interesting to laugh with or at.

But the commentary is actually fairly entertaining. I was surprised the actors would agree to do it; one would think that they would want to forget the embarrassment of showing up in this tripe as soon as possible. But they actually seem to be having a good time on the commentary -- poking fun at the movie's dumbness, but also poking fun at some of the more head-scratching aspects of ""300,"" such as the ""bottomless pit of death,"" where misogynistic Persian messengers and the like can be maneuvered into standing in front of with bizarre and improbable ease.Kevin Sorbo, who is the sole reason I sat through this pile of stupidity -- he's actually a pretty decent comedic actor, and though he has gotten a bit craggy since the end of ""Hercules,"" he's still way hotter than any man his age has a right to be -- provides a few of the movie's mildly funny moments, and also some of the commentary's humor.

168,roman8,All Fears Confirmed,9,4 March 2008,"About Meet the Spartans? No.About most oh, so very negative comments? Yes.First things first: Meet the Spartans is anything but a cineast masterpiece. To all intent and purpose it is bad, but: it is MEANT to be bad, it is nothing more but one long, mean, cruel joke on media 'culture' in general and the American one in particular. Along with its audiences and critics. In terms of being made fun of without remorse, no-one gets left behind.It's tasteless, and it's merciless. Mercilessly funny, too.Is it badly written? Well, it's spoofing 300 - what did you expect? Is it badly directed? Well, it's spoofing 300 - what did you expect? Is it badly set? Well, it's spoofing 300 - what did you expect? Is it badly acted? Well - hold on a sec! Ummm, no, it isn't... Go figure! Sean Maguire is a bit overplaying, but by and large convincing - as is Carmen Electra. Casting Ken Davitian and Kevin Sorbo was a stroke of genius: they are both delivering superbly, and Dietrich Bader as well as Phil Morris are coming pretty close to their league, as well.And last, but not least: painting abs and making fun of it might not be everyone's idea of style, but it's highly amusing, and the way those abs finally looked... Particularly Sean Maguire, Kevin Sorbo and Travis van Winkle offered a sight fully legitimating the entrance fee.BTW: I watched this in Berlin the very day it was released, in the main Berlinale cinema a mere two weeks after this most high browed of all international film festivals ended. The theatre was packed, roaring with laughter - and no-one walked.And yes, it very much follows in the tradition of Monty Python. And just as with Monty Python, I could have done with less body fluid on the display and less fart jokes, too. Hence just 9/10 points.",Meet the Spartans

I have enjoyed all of the Scary Movie films so far, but there have been some films lately that I did not particularly care for. Does Date Movie ring a bell? This movie was awful, and it probably ruined Allyson Hannah's career. Then came Epic Movie, a film that was directed towards ten year-olds who laugh every single time someone gets kicked in the crotch. Yeah, Epic Movie was pretty bad.Just when I though movies couldn't get any worse, Meet The Spartans came out. This is the worst movie ever, right up there with House Party 4. I have never seen something so disgusting in my entire life. The acting is like a 3rd grade play. The jokes, well; there are no jokes. Just random references to pop culture that are supposed to be funny. It's not like Family Guy either. Family Guy has plenty of funny moments and they make plenty of pop culture references.

171,jmarinko-1,"300 Spoofs Later, Hollywood Finally Taps Out This Lame Genre",2,31 August 2008,"Hollywood has churned out a slew of spoofs within the last year alone, including Epic Movie, Balls of Fury, The Comebacks, and Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story. Now,we have Meet the Spartans -- a spoof of a movie, 300. One wonders if studios aren't already developing spoofs of their forthcoming summer movies for release the following winter.Meet the Spartans tells the same story as 300, so much so that it dances perilously close to crossing the fine line between parody and plagiarism. True, 300 recounts a historical event, but as uniquely envisioned by Frank Miller in comic book form and then Zack Snyder on film. As much as Walk Hard owed a lot to Walk the Line, it never lifted scenes and shots directly the way that Spartans does to 300.Like 300, Meet the Spartans chronicles the youth and training of Spartan king Leonidas (Sean Maguire), his defense of his nation against the invading Persian army of Xerxes (Borat's Ken Davitian), the efforts by Leonidas' wife (called Queen Margo here, and played by Carmen Electra) to help rally political will for her husband's cause, and the Spartans' bold last stand. Of course, it's all turned on its head by writers-directors Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer (the duo behind Epic Movie and Scary Movie). For starters, this Leonidas only has 13 warriors rather than 300.Meet the Spartans is chock full of ""cameos"" by movie characters and pop culture icons, such as Shrek, Paris Hilton, Ghost Rider, the judges of American Idol, and Britney Spears. (Even Ain't It Cool News honcho Harry Knowles gets a jab.) Besides 300, there are plenty of scenes satirizing other big Hollywood films, such as Casino Royale, Stomp the Yard, and Spider-Man 3. Reality shows and game shows are also parodied. Seeing as how Spartans is their seventh produced spoof, one wonders what stone is left to be turned by Friedberg and Seltzer.",Meet the Spartans

I hate all these long messages people write so i will keep mine short. This film is NOT AS BAD as people say. If you like spoofs why not watch it. Because I hate to break it to all you people out there but no one else is bothering to make spoofs any more, So unless you want to keep re- watching naked gun, hot shots and airplane etc... you might as well embrace the fact that someone is still bothering to make these spoofs.so stop complaining, because I know that as soon as another spoof comes out you all will go and watch it regardless. I mean nearly tripling your money on a movie is pretty impressive.

The blanket is sewn together with idiocracy and each patch is a probe at pop culture. Did I mention that there are about a million patches? The writers seem to think they are comic geniuses, slapping audiences in the face with a joke in every line or/and shot.

I will say this:if you get the DVD,watch it with the audio commentary on,that way you won't have to listen to the awful language being used. The commentary is the one redeeming factor that makes the movie worth watching. The extras,on the other hand,are great to watch,particularly the cast production number at the end. The set tour piece and the Prepare for Thrusting piece are both hilariously funny-better than the movie itself! The main(and only reason)I bought the DVD is because of Kevin Sorbo,who really looks great in the movie! The one other person I liked in this movie was Nicole Parker. Her impressions of Brittany Spears(in the production number)and Ellen Degeneres were right on the mark. Not the greatest movie I've ever seen,but it is good for a few laughs!",Meet the Spartans

It means 'a film that parodies other films instead of having an art value of its own' in terms of characters, story line and the like, such as a happy ending. Why is it then that when I read reviews on this film, these reviews also seemed to spoof the very first review that commented on this film? Lemmings go over the edge into the Pit of Death, anyone?. The film was accused of recycling its material ad nauseam, yet those reviews recycled ad nauseam as well for instance the names of ""good"" spoof movies, such as Top Secret (Val Kilmer, you might remember). Oh, give me a break. Give me a royal Spring Break '08.There is no such thing as a good spoof movie. The whole of this genre is designed to be disposable: it uses other people's leftovers and warms up once again thereof a passable meal, feeding the endless gluttony of moviegoers the world over. Therefore, it's pointless to flog makers of this fare, a bit like puritan Christians going after the makers of horror films. Even if the film was gross, it has managed to gross more than its budget back even now.Sean Maguire was a convincing berserk of the Spartan kind. MadTV actress Nicole Parker did a few great impersonations. Xerxes was so fat and disgusting that he was almost hilarious. Carmen Electra brought some feminine relief to this otherwise masculine navel-gazing while the slice of salami pizza over her v***na was in particular seductive. The end song, ""I will survive"" tied up the loose ends and was the happy ending we wanted. Stop complaining.

After seeing that awful trailer I simply waited for it to arrive on DVD. No spoof movie deserves paying out decent money for and none of them need a big screen to get a laugh. So I ordered the DVD from an online rental company and the cost worked out at about 5p each. I made sure I got enough beer in for myself and mates to enjoy before watching it. I think it fair to say we all had a great laugh (what we managed to see and hear that is) and this film certainly gets the thumbs up from me and my friends.

What was shown in this movie from start to the end were scene-by-scene rip-off jokes that either come off as a great laugh or just plain tasteless for the viewers.For most part, i think there wasn't much to laugh at. To me, the experience was an agony but i do know of people who laughed their brain off; i felt bad that the spoof was so poorly pieced together, guess the people who wrote and directed it never took a close look at other spoof movies (e.g. Spaceballs, Scary Movie 1 & 2) before doing this one ... this would have been one of the all time great spoof movies, i think the casting was the only good thing about this movie, everyone could act their respective roles really well, but for a spoof to be good, even a spoof-plot has to be properly written and directed ... which you would not find in this movie, sadly.An utter waste of money indeed ...Best way to know how bad it is, is simply drag someone who enjoyed 300 to see this, and record their opinion down on tape!",Meet the Spartans

Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer (Date movie, Epic movie) have taught me that you don't need talent or skill to make a movie. It doesn't even have to make sense or a cohesive flow or costume changes. As long as there's profit Meet the Spartans could be stupid as it gets.Even if you enjoyed 'Epic movie' or 'Date movie' Meet the Spartans doesn't have even one joke to laugh at. Epic movie and Date movie at least had some jokes. So far instead of parodying 300 they parody Stomp the yard, Happy feet, Starbucks, American Idol, Dancing with the stars, Deal or no deal, Gatorade, Casino Royale, Borat, Britney Spears, Rambo, Spider-man 3, Donald trump, Transformers, Shrek the third, Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt, and you see where I'm going with this. Meet the Spartans doesn't even seem like it's trying to be funny. 'Epic movie' and 'Date movie' tried to be funny but failed miserably. Sadly Meet the Spartans has absolutely nothing to laugh at.Meet the Spartans only runs an hour long. The credits are half as long as the movie. That's sad isn't it? It's even more sad that the 'I will survive' musical number in the credits is better than the entire movie put together. And you know what's even more sad the Spider-man 3, Donald Trump, and Rambo parts are not in the movie only the credits. Meet the Spartans is filled with poop gags, spit gags, vomit gags, gay jokes, sex jokes, puss jokes, and the list goes on with painfully unfunny jokes.May I remind you that these unfunny jokes keep repeating. The stupid gross-out humor- actually it isn't humor uses up for 75% of the movie. The 25% rest of the movie are jokes that 3rd graders would find funny. The only reason why Meet the Spartans was PG-13 was because there were some sexual references. If there was none this would easily be PG. Meet the Spartans isn't a 'teen' comedy or an 'adult' comedy it's easily not comedy at all. I think instead of 2 of the writers of Scary movie we need 4 writers back and leave Jason and Aaron out of it. Now you know what's even more sad? That every single movie made by these two hacks are always panned for critics and end up on their worst films of the year list. Yet these directors keep making the same movies. I don't care if the film is 'R' rated and not funny at least we have something interesting here. If you have a 'PG-13' that's not funny and purely no language, no violence, and no nudity leave you into the worst movie in cinemas.Even if you didn't pay to see this movie and seeing it online. It will still feel like you spend $100 to see this movie. Meet the Spartans clearly lacks humor, originality, solid performances, and so much more. Clearly the same audiences keep seeing these bomb shell movies. The teens. Seriously if you see a 5/10 or higher rating that's the teens for you. Even I wouldn't know how anyone would think this is entertainment.Overall I think that the teen audiences always see these parody movies when there are so many better films out there that get well reviewed and are playing wide release and some of the movies are for their audience group. Yet the ignore it and see something that looks funny but ends up turning incredibly stupid start to finish.I wish I could give Meet the Spartans 0 out of 10. Even 1/2 out of 10.

A SNL skit of about two minutes might have been the end result and we might have forgiven them for it, since at least on SNL they try new things.While I only spent $3 on my ticket, I feel like they need to pay me back for the time they took away from my movie life. I've seen offensive movies before and there is usually a point to be made, here the only point is ""I've got you ticket money and what will you do about it.""

Think of the synchronized swim nuns in History of the World or the crazy 40's dance number at the end of Blazing Saddles.The Meet spoof of Stomp the Yard gave me a big smile just because the excellent talent in Meet perfectly matched Yard in an absurd as Spartans vs Persians context. Spoof as parody instead of farce is not new, it may just be a unfamiliar to some of the reviewers.The 300 movie was so beautifully art directed and shot, the story a genuine epic, and the film heroic and moving. Meet the Spartans plays on this with big chunks of entertainment that I can appreciate.You won't get a production like Tvatzy singing ""I'm Tired of Men"" from the excellent Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker spoofs. But you'll find one even funnier if you know who Marlene Dietrich is. Not all spoof forms are what you're used to. After all, comedy was born way before we were.",Meet the Spartans
195,alain-minsart,Whenever it was funny it wasn't intended ....,2,12 July 2009,"Whenever u thought that parodies couldn't get much lower then the last one that passed the screen, then u see another one and u just realized that the bucket is way much deeper then u can imagine. This movie, and I don't even want to go into the acting of the movie, because and let me try to say this with a example to show u at what level the actors did perform. It is like putting up apples and letting them play lemons. Truly unbelievable and awesomely bad. Story lines never that much of an issue in parodies anyway, usually they take out one movie, and slightly follow that line (in this case '300') and around that they intend to build up one joke after the other. And that is where it is all going to hell, for as far I am concerned. I really had to struggle to watch the last 60 min of the movie, and let me remind u that the movie is only 80 min or so. To see Carmen Electra showing up once again in this type of film doesn't surprise me at all, she has no more reputation left to ruin, so much lower then she is already she cannot sink. And Kevin Sorbo (Hercules) well just shows how good his acting-career is going that he is obliged to be in pictures like this. And to be honest he is the most funniest actor in the whole movie, considering he has not one single funny bone in his body. But then again it shows u once more the level of this movie. I gave it a 2 rating, but even that is over appreciated, but seeing that I am a nice guy and I can appreciate the effort and the money that was put into this project, I think they can use some small amount of support, but that is a far as my generosity goes. To end it off, I would say stay away from this, unless u are a fan of Carmen and love seeing her half naked. (But for that I would suggest you-tube, couple of thousands clips of her there also, and u don't need to sit out 75 min of crap) And if u do really want to spend money on this, better spend on a lottery-ticket, u will have more chance of winning a prize there, then seeing a good movie here.",Meet the Spartans

If I had, I'd have demanded a refund. This is quite possibly one of the worst films ever made and the shameful advertising of several well known products within the film made me feel sick.The ""actors,"" and I use the term loosely, are in my opinion nothing more than mere whores as it seems to me they will do anything for money. To stoop so low as to appear in a howler like this, removes any shred of credibility they may have had (that's assuming they had any in the first place).Do yourselves a favour and stay away from this turkey.

Looking at the other films Seltzer and Friedberg have made did you actually think this one would break the mold of unfunny spoof films? I didn't, but I still like to actually see the movie BEFORE I rip on it. Now that being said, I got 100% what I expected: An occasional chuckle, but mostly lame jokes that are beaten to death, bad acting, bad direction, cheap looking sets and Carmen Electra looking more and more haggard with each passing movie. Even the product placement bits weren't that funny. These guys need to go back and watch Airplane, Naked Gun, Scary Movie 1, or even Spaceballs to see how a spoof movie should be made. The cutaway jokes on Family Guy rip pop culture far more effectively and much funnier than what this movie tries to do.

I think all the people criticising this film should go and watch a movie called 300 first and then watch it again. Believe me if you do this you'll soon be cursing yourself for sounding like such fools.The way it takes a serious film (300) and makes it hilarious is cutting edge. My favourite scene was the dance off, if you know anything about sparta you would know that there is no way they would ever dance, let alone take the time for choreography lessons. Not funny if you know nothing of spartan culture, bone-achingly funny if you do.Thats the tragedy of this film, if people watched 300 first, or did any historical research into spartan culture, they would see the wonderful humour brimming so tantalisingly beneath the surface. We are not laughing at what the spartans are doing, but rather laughing at things they would never do. Irony is the mother of comedy.I challenge you to watch 300, research ancient sparta and then watch this film. You won't regret it.",Meet the Spartans
201,nehesi,A few good gags. . but not quite enough,2,2 September 2008,"I should preface this by saying Airplane! and I'm Gonna Get You Sucka are my two favorite movies of all time. In both cases, I can quote entire scenes and yet, somehow, they're still funny to me.This movie was no Airplane! I'm sure I could work in an easy joke about it not even being a bomb dropped by an airplane, but I digress.A few good gags here: The slow motion battle scene The skipping/marching and Hi-fives vs tongue-kiss - both based on the ""there's a tone of homoerotic tension here - because they're secretly GAY! HA HA HA"". If they hadn't beaten these jokes into the ground, they would have stayed funny.The FIRST time they booted someone into the pit (had they only done it once, maybe twice and then went straight to the Idol judges, it might have worked better). I watched the unrated version from the DVD and almost all of the jokes, even when midly funny, went on waaay to long, especially the dancing Stomp The Yard parody - which was a funny gag, for the first maybe 10 seconds as the idea of the Spartans and their enemies fighting through dance sequence was rather inspired.For every decently funny gag here, there were a bunch that fell flat or left me going WTF? (Transformers!?! Black Spiderman?).I can only recommend this to fans of the genre with a few hours to kill and a Netflix/digital Cable subscription - so that you don't have to pay any extra to watch this.",Meet the Spartans

But I did, and I still reject the day that I did that... I also hated that they did BAD impressions of the famous people of America, favorite games, TV shows that are watched by a lot of people and other movies or characters of that movie. And then the thing with the pit of death! I guess they thought their movie was too short so they stretched out a joke so far that it is not funny anymore. And the sexuality of Carmen Electra was way over the top. I gave it a 2, not a 1, because I thought there are movies worse then this one. I haven't found them yet, but I know that they're out there. Don't get me wrong and I said it before: I like parodies and I like the kind of humor Leslie Nielsen, kind of, introduced. But this was nothing like it. They tried, but didn't succeed.

Mine however will be handing over £5.50 of my money to the incompetent duo who made this film and sitting through the 70 most deeply boring/embarrassing minutes of my life in a cinema when I could be doing something more fun. What? Almost anything.This film has no redeeming features. From the soundtrack, which consists solely of cheap hip-hop and inept remixes of dance songs, to the effects, most of which wouldn't look out of place in an amateur Be Kind Rewindesque fan parody (if you want to parody Transformers, then at LEAST make your vehicles, you know, TRANSFORM), to the acting (clearly they think they can get away with the shoddiest, hammiest high-school play acting, so long as they punctuate it with fanservicey images of Carmen Elektra), is so poorly executed you wonder whether the makers of this film are deliberately doing everything they were told not in film school.Special mention of course goes to the humour. Whether it's a ""hilarious"" bodily fluid splatter joke, a very 'political' jab against some Hollywood celebrity (oh, Britney shaving her head! Clever), ""postmodern"" product-placement (ie, adverts so blatant you just stare on aghast) or a reference to some obscure minutiae of American popular culture (half the reality shows references will be forgotten within a year), there's not an intentional laugh in the film. The only points that even raised a chuckle were: a) the terrible lookalikes (apparently, the only criteria for being a Paris Hilton lookalike is that you are blond), b) the shoddy effects, c) the nonsensical casting of ""the fat guy from Borat"" as Xerxes and the moronic narrator telling us ""Xerxes looked like the fat guy from Borat"".

Alas, the makers of this steaming turd did not know the difference. Yes, 300 is a perfect movie to parody and with the budget and production values this movie has (very good) they could have made a great flick. Unfortunately, they seem to think that every single portion of the film should be some sort of gag. There are about 3 funny bits in this film. They are mixed with about 300 very unfunny bits. Pop culture parodies that don't work combined with sight gags that are predictable. I really cannot say enough bad things about this film.

I was only marginally entertained by ""Scary Movie""(I'm sure most of which all had to do with the Wayans brothers), and abhorred the sequel. I saw ""Scary Movie 4""(but not the third movie) just to pass the time with a friend, and despite maybe one joke that worked(Sort of. It's the one where a ray gun disintegrates everyones clothes), I was utterly bored. ""Date Movie"" was another film I saw almost out of some obligation to watch whatever DVD my pop collects, and the film was horrible and monotonous, and worst of all, boring. There is nothing worse than a bad comedy. I didn't follow up on ""Epic Movie"", ""Superhero Movie"", ""Disaster Movie"", and I will probably never watch anything else by these hacks again.In between all this garbage however, is ""Meet the Spartans"", which isn't as shallow or tedious as their other films. Actually, some of the jokes work, and that is because this film has the good sense to wield sex as its arbitrator of humor. Not all, mind you, but a surprising amount of the humor works, which is a lot of gay jokes, as Greeks are famous for their comfort with homosexuality inmany instances. There are also jokes intended for the red blooded male in mind. I was surprised at how the actors actually put conviction into these jokes, as if they actually are trying to entertain the audience. If it is on a base level, at least it is a pleasurable one.Also, there are a few dance numbers in here which entertained me, and the reason I liked them is because they were silly, out of left field, and not as mean spirited as Friedburg/Seltzer skits usually are. Also, I think that they inadvertently raised the level of craftsmanship by placing the story in a historical context. Even if you know nothing about the Greeks outside of ""300"", at least that makes you aware that there is life outside of vapid popular culture. Oh sure, there are plenty of cringe worthy references to celebrities and American Idol, but than again, what were you expecting from this movie?",Meet the Spartans

Perhaps I'm not qualified to give a review let alone rate this film since I thought it was idiotic by minute 1 and getting worst by the second. By minute 3 I'd already thought I'd wasted enough of my precious life and turned it off to get back to the HBO mini-series on John Adams. Now THAT is something worth seeing.

Certainly.Clocking in at just under an hour and a half, shorter if you exclude credits, Meet the Spartans is dry, oft-boring, and random to an extent that makes it difficult to tell when they're actually trying to tell a joke. Though well-conceived, the painfully short running time coupled with what was obviously a microscopic budget meant that this film came across as being far too much funny crammed into too small a space. The result? A new joke was on the screen before the previous one had yet to develop into a punch line, and the audience is left with nothing but a bunch of half-finished humor.Now, about that 4 / 10 rating I delivered this dreadful film; don't get me wrong, the movie is garbage. However, there was the occasional moment in which an imaginative mind was able to have a slight deal of fun with the material presented, including one such humorous take on the excessive use of green/blue-screening in almost all modern films (that, and I reserve lower ratings for far worse films). The only real reason this had any laughable effect was because it was a joke re-used at what could almost be called the right times. Every other portion of humor present in the film was long gone nearly three seconds after it was generated and had absolutely no relevant bearing to the remainder of the film. It was much akin to telling of a murder mystery by introducing over eighty characters in the first half and then having them all leave while one man comes into the center of the frame and commits the crime in front of everyone. No joke was ever given time to develop, and no characters were given even the slightest amount of depth. Now, I know that's asking a lot from a modern comedy, but in all seriousness, I've had gas that had more character.In all honesty though, it was still worth a laugh here and there.This film will be particularly enjoyed by goldfish, who have a short enough attention span to enjoy all the jokes in sequence.",Meet the Spartans

You helped this movie gross masses at the US Box office which means again the Men behind most of Americas horrendous comedies of recent years are going to keep churning them out. To add insult to injury you also cast one of Britain's golden boys in the title role and probably ruined his career in the process.This movie is the worst movie of all time. OK I smiled all the way through but only because I cannot believe the studios funded this utter rubbish. Beware, I feel ""Scary Movie 15"" or ""American Pie 61"" being made off the profits they took from this. If you enjoyed this movie you are either in a padded cell or know the crew.

226,KartofflMuter,Meet the Spartans -better than the material it's spoofing-most of the time.,6,8 February 2009,"Meet the Spartans may be silly and stupid but it is a spoof after all. I laughed out loud repeatedly when I saw it last week On Demand. OK-it was free and the price was right. It's a spoof of the movie 300. saying it had no plot is nonsense. It actually follows the movie from beginning to end. I've watched 300 3 x now and MTS 3+ x. On the whole,MTS was the better movie. I could have done without the defecating penguin and the general use of body fluids for laughs from the first shot of the the baby Leonides(who did look a lot like a baby Shrek) to the Pit of Doom to Xerxes (who's body jewelry I thought was over the top-till I saw 300!)and the training of the small boys( which again struck me as too harsh-till I saw 300.) All in all,this reminded me of SNL spoofing S. Palin. The lines were already there. So was the plot. If you didn't like the spoof,maybe you should take a more critical look at the original.So here I am -it's July 18,2009. I have watched the movie 5 times-at least. As soon as I get around to it ,I will buy a copy.It's fandamdtastic. I read ALL the comments. SHAME one your closed little minds. I don't usually waste much time on spoofs but this was a worthy one. I watched it in isolation. I watched after having seen its model. Best of all,I watched the 2 movies back to back. Wow! The 300 was pretentious crap. Really. But Meet The Spartans made it forever,memorable pretentious crap.I especially love the spray-on six packs and the dancing and skipping.But then I have a superb sense of humour and just love the snark. As for the child abuse? It's actually a pretty broad depiction of what happens in 300. So maybe you should watch closer.",Meet the Spartans
227,JackHammer69,Absolute crud,1,27 June 2018,The tools who wrote and produced this movie need to stop turning everything into a dance battle. It's not funny.The great spoof movies contain lots of great one-liners and little 3 second references to their serious counterparts etc. They do not take a bunch of Pop Culture references and make 15 minute scenes out of each of those references.These guys need a kick in the head.,Meet the Spartans

Everything looked so fake and the acting was terrible. I don't see what is funny of many of these ""jokes"". The main bad guy transformed to literally fall a minute after, is that supposed to be funny?Besides advertisement, it seems the purpose of the movie was to insult several celebrities and their life decisions or how they represent themselves. That may be funny, but again it was done in such disorganized manner that it was confusing of why they were introduced in the movie. Literally, anyone could have directed this movie.

This doesn't have much of a story either and yes it is a rip off of 300 but it is aware that it is stupid and it is a fun diversion. I'm sure if I was a fan of 300 I would think this movie sucked but since it isn't the case, I have to say I enjoyed the movie with all its stupid humor, advertising within the film, and all the pop culture references. This movie will definitely be very dated later on but for right now its funny. However if you haven't seen 300 and don't watch much TV its really not going to be much fun at all. Most of the humor assumes that you have seen these popular shows like American Idol, Deal or No Deal, & etc. My friend hadn't seen 300 so they didn't appreciate much of the humor. Make sure you at least see 300 first and if you didn't like it you may enjoy this.",Meet the Spartans

Well, yeah, in general, the movie sucked. Boring plot, stupid effects, and ridiculously short. But I have to give it credit because, even though it wasn't a pretty good movie, I laughed some times. I loved for example, Nicole Parker's impressions, she was brilliant doing Britney, Paris and Paula Abdul, she cracked me up. Plus the part where Leonidas is lifting Carmen Electra's character and then throws her to the floor I laughed at that part...

Boy I wish I knew what was coming. I think that you need to be on some SERIOUS drugs to even sit through the first ten minutes. This movie is beyond bad or awful and it is officially the worst movie I have EVER seen. It seems as though all the budget for the movie was spent to make the trailers. Many people got lured to see this crap only to find out that they had been mentally raped. However what's done is done- the movie is bad and you MUST NOT see it under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. That's why when I came home after watching this crap I first looked at who made this movie so I would preserve my brain from being raped for the future. And I was not surprised when I saw that Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer are the ones responsible. Those two are world class specialists in making #### movies. They are responsible for things like ""The Epic movie"" as well as the ""Date movie"" (both are horrid). As of now I can come up with about a thousand things I want to do to Friedberg and Seltzer if I ever get a chance to meet them. None of those things are legal...

Also, there was a lot of advertising, I left like I was watching t.v. at one point. I really do not understand how a movie like this made number one the 1st week, but I can tell you after the word gets out it will not last.

I thought it was written by the guys who wrote Scary Movie because those movies are at least worth seeing. Yet, then I found out that it was written by the two guys who wrote Date Movie. I previously thought that it was not possible to make a spoof movie worse than Date Movie but I was proved wrong. Those two should be banned from making movies! The first ten minutes were actually pretty funny so i guess it wasn't all bad but after those ten minutes it was absolutely awful! I remember when spoof movies actually tied all the movies that they were making fun of together in a smart way. They just took movies and threw them in as stupidly as they possible could. It brings shame to the movie 300. It was the only movie that I've ever seen in theaters when I seriously thought about leaving. This movie was probably written in a day.

So many of the film's jokes are so drawn out that whatever humor originally present just gets diluted. It was funny kicking a celebrity into the pit of death once. Five times later, it's just stale and dragging. If you've seen the trailers to this, you've basically seen about 90% of the film. The script could have been easily condensed to a 10 minute sketch for Saturday Night Live. The humor is so repetitive; almost all of the jokes play off either the Spartans questionable sexuality or celebrities' promiscuity. A blurred-out vagina just isn't that funny, why did the movie choose to use it 5 times? While there were numerous pop-culture references, there simply wasn't much done with it. Someone forgot to tell the middle-schooler who wrote this that having a poorly impersonated celebrity appear isn't funny by itself.Don't see this movie, even if you liked similar spoof movies (like Scary Movie).",Meet the Spartans

This was a complete waste of time and came nothing close to what a fine Mel Brooks Spoof such as ""Robinhood: Men in tights"" or ""Spaceballs"".

At the end of the mercifully just-over-an-hour film, he turned to me and apologized for making me sit through that with him, then told me that the movie must have shortened the time he had left.In the next two years that followed, I had pretty much forgotten all about Meet the Spartans and its litany of terrible jokes and stupid sight gags. My friend passed away. I started to go to university. I got a job. And many, many better movies came out. Then, two weeks ago, the unthinkable happened. This abomination of a motion picture was unceremoniously tossed back into my life in the form of a DVD. My roommate had found it in the bargain bin at Wal-Mart and wished to watch it. I hesitantly agreed, hoping that maybe on the second viewing it would be better. Unsurprisingly, it wasn't. The jokes were still unfunny, gross-out humor that would only amuse middle school boys was still abundant, and the theme of ""hurr durr, look at the ghey guyz"" was still the main takeaway from this film.I had the misfortune of sitting through this atrocity twice.

They started out great with Scary Movie, but from there it seems like it just went down.I've seen Disaster Movie, and surprisingly I liked it more than I liked this movie. Don't get me wrong, Disaster Movie still is a disaster. Meet the Spartans probably just seemed worse to me, because I have seen pretty much the same jokes that are used in Disaster Movie. Everything is filmed in a same way, the same jokes are used. Not to mention the bad special effects and all the scenes that we get to see.To explain my vote of three stars - all of the jokes were not that bad and some can be quite a good laugh if you are in the mood for watching such a movie. I'm the type of person that likes things to be excessively stupid, but as I've mentioned before, the line is crossed in quite many of these films.I still intend to see Epic Movie or Date Movie, though.

Even if it was free, I wouldn't recommend watching it.I was glad that the movie was barely 90 minutes long as I couldn't stand to watch it for much longer. I would have walked out of the movie had it not been for my friend watching it with me.The movie itself is full scenes loosely strung together, unfunny dialog, and editing that makes me wonder if Windows Movie Maker was used. Just from the opening scene there was a vomit joke (with magic vomit that disappeared the second the angle changed) and lip syncing that made a Brittany Spears concert look impressive.Also included in the movie was Carmen Electra, the walking eye candy for their 13 year old boy target demographic. Most of the scenes she was in involved the camera focusing on her breasts or her walking around in revealing clothing.After going to battle there was little direction to the movie, and they seemed to just wander around trying to make as many references to pop culture with as little humor as possible.The remainder of the ""jokes"" involved either product placement or homosexuality. The product placement became so frequent throughout the movie that I began to wonder if they were even making fun of it anymore.Most of these attempts at comedy were poorly received by the audience, save a few children who also had to scream out ""eww"" whenever the Spartans stood in a provocative position in their revealing clothing.The movie ended quite abruptly, with all Leonidas and his Spartans killed and the blind incompetent spartan inadvertently running away. It ended with the cast singing ""I Will Survive"" (for the second time) on an American Idol stage, and finally ending the torment of watching the movie.Overall, I would not recommend anyone viewing this movie.

I really loved that movie and in my opinion the director really could beat the 300 movie which was a terrible mistake in the history of movie making. the guys in the movie played incredibly funny which had me and all of my friends in stitches. I scored the movie 10 which it deserves to get. Sean Maguire was awesome and he humiliated the 300 crap. You have to watch it guys it shows that stupid Spartans with their freaky outfit which suits the fagots! try to fight the great Persian army and all they got is 13 stupid fagot dancers!!!! try to fight (dance)!!!! The DEAD PIT was a great scene in which Leonidas which stands for lions like that I'd rather say loser's like kicks the whole famous Hollywood stars in. The way that Leonidas treats his child is like an animal which is manifest in the movie :)). I'd really wanna thank Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer for this gift to the Persia kingdom.,Meet the Spartans

This movie has the same plot as 300 which is receiving a message from the messenger and and having several battles against xeroxes army, in much in a more humor way. Although instead of REAL battles, they have a break dance and stomp competition and mom jokes, Through out the movie you will see judges just like American idol, only when the Spartans has competitions/battles, It has good quality I don't want to spoil too much, so ill just say 1 thing, the ending would of been better cause they over done it with the result of the Spartans death oh and 1 more thing, its only ONE HOUR LONG! just 60 minutes i still recommend you guys to watch it",Meet the Spartans

I found myself laughing a fair amount of the time, and I also found myself shaking my head a few times as well.a few faults with the movie, was all the gay jokes, there were just too many to be funny. there are a few spots where I found myself shaking my head at the distance they did to try and be funny with some of the jokes. there are a few gross jokes, and a few that could be considered to be abusive.i give the movie a 6 for it did make me laugh, but faults took away from the movie in my opinion.",Meet the Spartans

Meet the Spartans was the perfect insult to the film.As it is a parody film, it can be cut some slack with regards to the plot. However 90% of the 'jokes' were pop-culture references or parodies of films other than ""Three Hundred"".Several times over the course of the film, jokes were repeated over and over again in slightly different styles when in essence being the same old thing.One good use of this film is for interrogation rooms.

And by hell do i regret it there is nothing worse than a comedy that isn't funny ever if it is well made. But this isn't funny and could of been made better by a spastic with a camera phone, I laughed once in this movie and that was at myself for wasting 84 minutes of my life watching this pile of rubbish. The worst thing for me and most probably you as well is you just feel if the idea of one big parody was given to someone with talent it would of been a good film but instead it was given to a couple of idiots who Co-wrote scary movie.As a whole i recommend you save your money but of you really want to go and see this bring a Ipod it will be far better that way.",Meet the Spartans

If u r sexual stiff and uptight then don't watch it, but if u r sexually conscious, open minded, etc, then this flick will have you rolling!

The jokes are extremely childish yet I wouldn't recommend it for children as some bits are somewhat offencive..they have really missed the mark on this one which I was really hoping would be good as I usually love this style of film. Most of the gags in the film have been seen time and time again and by the end the audience was really switching off and the younger members of the audience just started throwing popcorn around as it was so bad.

Because they will grow up and regret their decision. Anyway i didn't really see a plot to the film, mainly stabs at celebrities, stabs that are constant, unfunny and unsurprisingly predictable. This is all performed (i use that word loosely) under the guise of Spartans, who most people believe to be half naked bodybuilders who shout a lot. AS much as i hated the attempts at humour and the fact that this is classed as a comedy, what i hate the most is that the stupid people who enjoyed this probably believe that the spartans were really like the way they're portrayed in this ""film"" or in 300 for that matter.

And really, I was hoping it would be funny. The film is startlingly unoriginal and plays like a 3-min ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch that has been stretched out to 84 mins. Bad acting, terrible casting, worse special effects and a literally non-existent laugh-to-joke ratio, this film was torture to sit through. The directors couldn't even get the so-called celebrity ""look-a-likes"" right. Seriously, if they hadn't have said ""Hey that's Paris Hilton"" or ""Ugly Betty"" or ""Lindsay Lohan"" you would not have recognized the ""celebrity.""

271,elem_hunter,Not as bad as I first thought it would be...,7,7 February 2008,"I have to say that for the first time, since I've been using IMDb.com to see how good or bad a movie is (before actually watching the movie), I've been tricked by all the bad comments about this title. First of all, the movie is a parody. What can you guys expect from a parody? You are expecting incredible acting? A well planned plot? You know, you usually don't see this in parodies. I for one was a fan of the Scary Movie series (although as they progressed through the sequels, the movies were less and less funnier). This movie is WAY and I'm telling you WAY better than Epic Movie. You can't even compare Epic Movie with this one. Now Epic Movie was a really bad parody. Its jokes were not funny at all (most of them anyway). In ""Meet the Spartans"" you will see a movie that will follow the trail of the original movie (considered by some a master-piece, considered by others a gross exaggeration, in a Hollywood-style) and the adventures of the ""heroes"" in the movie will look very similar to the ones in 300. Of course, there are exaggerations. You will see a blend between the ancient times and the modern days (from time to time in the movie - e.g. the appearance of Britney Spears). What I did like most about this movie were the few, but excellent, ""smart jokes"" that were aimed strictly at the movie 300 and several of its features: E.g. :the fact that there were exactly 300 spartans and all were top-models. So all in all, I advise you to go and see this movie. If you don't like parodies, stay home and do something else or wait for it to appear on DVD at a cheap price. But if you are a parodies lover and if you watched 300 (at least once - I saw it twice) , this movie is a must see. It will definitely make you laugh for 80 full minutes out of 84 minutes.Have fun and don't let the comments get you down! I'll give it a 7 (because I did not like the ending part).",Meet the Spartans

It was exactly what I expected, a 300 spoof with cultural references to other movies and societies, only funnier. I hadn't liked Date Movie or Epic Movie, so I was skeptical.

I thought Epic Movie was bad, I thought Date Movie was horrid, but neither of those pieces of crap hold a candle to the stench that is Meet The Spartans.If you have absolutely nothing better to do, and someone will pay you to watch it, don't.

This movie would be more appropriate as a special episode of a sketch show like Mad TV. Paying to watch this in the theaters is totally worthless. I will not rule out possibilities of getting it on DVD, though. It has some funny moments, but not all that funny. Some parts that were supposed to be funny never got a laugh out of anyone in the theater, while some made everyone giggle in the least.As far as acting is concerned, It is unlikely that anyone would be expecting Oscar-winning acting off such a film. Suffice to say, when asked for, the actors deliver a fulfilling act. The problem is not with the actors. It is with the script. Every other scene, I would go ""I could have made this soo much funnier"". So yeah, there we have it. But overall, I would say I liked this better than Epic Movie and Date Movie. Nowhere near the scary movies though.So, bottom line, do not waste your time and money watching this in the theaters. Wait for it on DVD or Star Movies.

But then again, if everything looked as if it were made out of cardboard I at least would have had something to laugh about.Avoid this at all cost.

Three males and one female, aged 29 to 55, all agreed that this show only deserves a rating of ""1"". The general consensus was that it may very well be the worst movie any of us have ever seen. There are actually a couple of sincerely humorous bits in the movie, but not enough to make it worth the admission. When other family members were asked who might like the movie, comments were ""maybe the blind and deaf"" (because they would be spared) or maybe someone between 6th and 9th grade. However, the subject matter is not appropriate for young people. The MPAA rating is ""PG-13"", but I think parents should think twice before showing this to younger family members. The jokes are often of a sexual nature and violence is portrayed, although in ridiculous ways. Of course, a spoof of ""The 300"" is expected to have violence of some sort. Viewers will understand more of the ""jokes"" if they have already seen ""The 300"", but it's not entirely necessary if you know a little about its plot. Kevin Sorbo and Carmen Electra are the best known actors in the film; what a comedown. We'd much rather see Sorbo in Andromeda or Hercules. If you're determined to see what it's like, I suggest waiting for the DVD. Better yet, wait until someone else rents it and watch with him! Once you decide to watch it to the end, stay through the credits. Like many of the newer shows, the credits have some extra things to watch.

Oh if there really were a pit of death for people like Britney, Helen Degenerate(Degeneres if you must spell her name right) who isn't even funny as well as Dana Cook who also isn't funny, the world would be a better place. And of course Bush should have long been pushed into it like he was in the movie. So many people go into the pit of Death but still not enough but how many can you push in within one movie?

Basically this movie ""spoofs"" ""300"", ""Happy Feet"", ""Transformers"", and other smash hits at the box office, but fails oh so miserably at doing so. So you take the mostly nude and ripped men from ""300"" and give them the ""Meet the Spartans"" twist and gay jokes ensue. How original; I NEVER saw that coming! Ugh... Oh, black gangster jokes are riddled through the film as well. Haha! I never saw anything like this before... Ugh...once again. The acting in this film is OK I suppose but then it's really hard to judge acting when the material is really worse than something written by an three year old with ADD. I suppose one ""good"" thing about the film is that visually it looks alright and not like it was made with a budget of $47.89. No millions added to that please. Another ""bright"" side is that the narrator every now and then says something remotely worthy of a chuckle, something the actors themselves never get. Honestly, I laughed aloud once and it may have been a bit forced... but I digress. As a film student I can't really begin to say just how utterly bad this movie was. I'm only 16 and I could write, cast, direct, and edit a better film and to be honest I'd be embarrassed to even tag my name onto ""Meet the Spartans"" credits. What else can I rant on about this film? Oh yes, I didn't think it was possible but this makes ""Epic Movie"" look as good as ""Juno."" Now there's a movie to spend $7 on!

Surely the creators didn't genuinely think that what they were doing was funny? I don't know how its possible to be so un-funny. No one cannot be that detached from reality, can they?. It makes me even more mad to know that somewhere someone is making movies like this and getting a lot of money for it? Even I...with no script writing experience could do a better job than this. I think a 10 year old kid probably could. How is it even possible for someone to be in a situation where they can make such bad movies? I think this movie does have a good point though.

If not, sic) would find more laughs in Saving Private Ryan than this deplorable effort.The Scary Movie films that came before this were, at best, hit and miss. Sadly, whoever wrote this screenplay decided to opt for the carpet-bomb approach and included as many poorly conceived pop culture references as possible without first having them proof read by comedy writers. Some bright spark in the production team actually thought that having numerous female cast members' legs fall open to reveal a blurred ""Britney shot"" would be utterly hilarious. How wrong they were. What we have as a result is the worst type of infantile garbage that even infants wouldn't find funny, nor for that matter will most teenagers.If I had wanted to spend 90 minutes growing increasingly more depressed I would have visited the grave of my beloved gerbil, Alan.

No, I'm sorry, that's insulting the kids! This movie is another nail in the coffin for this pair of ""Comedy Directors"", and I use the term comedy loosely. The question is, just how many nails can one coffin hold? There are so many at this stage.I know I've only addressed the acting and the writing, you may be asking ""what about the plot?"". Well, you already saw the plot. This movie is a cheap rip off of 300 and I don't think anybody would hold it against the makers of 300 for suing the makers of this movie. In fact, I would welcome it with open arms!Don't waste your money, don't even bother to let this movie waste your time. I would give this movie a worse rating but this site only lets you go down as far as 1.",Meet the Spartans
289,pp3click,Why these writers don't get it.,1,30 January 2008,"These guys just don't understand what is funny.Take for instance the Zucker brothers. They are who brought us such great spoofs as ""Top Secret,"" ""Airplane,"" the ""Naked Gun"" series, and ""BaseketBall."" When they parody films, they parody the GENRE of the film. If it's a Police who done it, then they use all of the clichés from that genre.The same can be said for the Waynes Brothers who collaborated with these tards on the first two Scary Movies. They spoof the ""horror"" genre or the ""hood"" genre in the case of ""Don't be a Menace."" Ultimately they ran out of movies to spoof and the Zucker brothers tried to save it to no avail.The problem with these writers is they don't understand that people don't want to see pop culture all throughout the movie. It wasn't funny when Shrek showed up as a baby! It WAS funny when the leading man said ""Walk with me over to the pit of death."" That's because it showed how ridiculous the real scene was in ""300."" One of the worst moments that made me jump out of my seat and almost leave was when a character said that Carmen Electra's character was ""venomous."" Carmen then starts to turn into Venom from Spider-Man. Another character then states, word for word, ""yeah, like Topy Mcguire in Spider-Man three. Are you so retarded in your writing that you have to point out your joke that wasn't even funny to begin with.Come on guys, just give it up. Go be producers because your films obviously make money.

To sum it up everything is just dragged out way too much and many of the same jokes are repeated way to often, Don't get me wrong it also contains some extremely funny spoofs, but just wait to rent it so you don't waste your money on the other 75% garbage.

Meet the Spartans should be played as a demonstration on 'how not to make a comedy'. It's just that bad. I think you get my point.They continually put in celebrities to poke fun at them, but that didn't work even the slightest. Too many bodily fluids we don't need to see, and pointless jokes.

Since Cloverfield was closed, I decided to go to this instead, knowing it would be dreadful. What followed was an awful experience. The jokes are aimed for ten-year-old kids who will laugh at anything. The plot was a pathetic rip-off of 300. Epic Movie was a phenomenon compared to this. The writers of these god-awful parodies are losing ideas. Sure, the Scary Movie series was okay, but after the third one, the writers began filling the void of good acting and funny slapstick comedy with obvious references to celebrities and TV shows. This all only leads me to believe that Meet the Spartans was not meant to be any good. The idiots who wrote it probably figured that an audience of immature kids would love it. Hey, every film writer screws up occasionally. What about George Lucas and Howard the Duck? The main problem is that these parody movies are vile, 90-minute crap-o-ramas that resort to language and dirty jokes to deliver a strained laugh. I didn't laugh.

310,CLoWnnSkuLL,So what did I just watch?,1,16 August 2010,"OK, so first thing's first, this movie is pure trash. After watching Friedberg and Seltzer's timeless classic 'Epic Movie' (2007), I felt a burning desire to tear off my skin and jump into an acid bath. 'Meet the Spartans' is no better. Even entering this movie with the lowest possible expectation, these douche bags still managed to surprise me.The plot is simply a scene-by-scene remake of '300' (2007), albeit with nonsensical inclusions such as towel-whipping, homosexual kissing, child bashing, ogre babies, Ugly Betty and of course three separate scenes where some sort of fight scene is judged by the panel of American Idol, America's Next Top Model, and some other reality show that eludes me right now.The movie mostly takes place in an awful set covered in sand with a few Styrofoam rocks placed around. This would be forgivable if the movie's actual material was up to scratch (which it isn't). There's only so much undue and misplaced insults to various celebrities such as Paris Hilton that one can properly ingest per scene; and Friedberg and Seltzer go into overdrive here. I nearly lost it when I saw Rocky get a botox needle shoved in his head, and when the ""fat guy from Borat"" transformed into Xerxetron from putting the ""Transformer cube"" in a low-rider. This isn't to take anything away from the guy who inexplicably turns into the Sandman from Spider-Man 3, who gets shat on by a cat and sucked into a dust-buster while exclaiming ""dust-buster bitch!"" This movie is utter balls.I think I should also mention that the film goes for about one hour. Then the credits roll, over a reprise of the ENTIRE cast singing ""I will survive"". Then it goes to black and more credits roll. But it gets better; after this there is a reel of what I read are meant to be deleted scenes, but really I had a tough time trying to fathom just what I was watching. It's like seeing the whole movie again, condensed to ten minutes, with the scenes shuffled. Then it goes to black again and more credits roll. It's astounding, it really is.On to the acting. Well, I suppose it works, but the dialogue and some of the things the actors have to put themselves through is truly embarrassing for them. I felt bad when the cast had to crack ""Yo Momma"" jokes and break dance. I really did.I guess I could keep going, but there really is no point.

But about halfway through that scene, where they should have ended it, they started making the jokes longer and just dumber. The worst part was they didn't even stay on track. They started as a parody of 300, a big epic adventure/action movie, and broke down into parodying whatever they could grab, including the whole genre of dance battling and insult battling.

317,jorenthecolei,Sparta w/ flair and substance for modern day ^_^,9,29 November 2008,"Spartan culture references and Wayan's bros. fanatics aside, this movie was good.To put it into perspective, I did not particularly like Scary Movie 1  the supposedly black homosexual was obviously ""too gay"" ( :D ) from the start. You could see that what most of the char's got, they tried to put spins on it  how else would a supposed ""mentally challenged"" friend get on the police force? Affirmative action would probably never risk people's safety that way :).I never saw 300, either. I figured all these ""researched"" historically accurate movies are a bunch of B.S.  no fault of the director Or screen-writerjust their ""capitalist overlords"" xD :D. I hated Saving Private Ryan.

""durlet's kill Donnie, because he's so likable""/""hey. Let's have a big gun battle! That'll off-set the whole long, drawn out, and personable conundrum we've been fleshing out this Entiremovie! ^_^"" :PAnyway, I loved Meet the Spartans more than anything from when I last saw a movie in theatersin the year 2001; ever since then, even the funny ones have been below-par, in my opinion.If one were to compare the pit of death with the disposal button to an actual pit trap, very nice. If you knew that Spartans were always the upstarts of the Greek world and preferredactivities rather than with some camp followers, then you have the basis of the movie, no matter how shallow. But it is true, that this movie was very shallow. Take into consideration, however, modern-day ethics with Spartan values, and you have this movie  an Excellent conundrum of having ""the next best Spartan"" or w/e show with the girl showing her uh, stuff to the winner; or having Xerxes with T-mobile (or w/e service), with his ""top 5"". Hilarious.

318,sgtrock40,I wish I had read this page before I went.,1,17 February 2008,"I love spoofs. Htey are one of my favorite forms of entertainment. Whether it's ""Scary Movie"" or ""Weird"" Al, a spoof is just a bit of good clean fun.Meet The Spartans is the antithesis of a good spoof. It's so bad that it isn't even good at being bad.For those who haven't already figured it out, this is supposed to be a spoof of 300, which I thought was an excellent film. The film in and of itself was perfect fodder for a spoof. Unfortunately, Spartans doesn't do enough with it. Some of the ideas in this movie were good, but they weren't brought out. Instead there is nothing but a mess. One quality of a good spoof is it's references to pop culture, and Spartans even manages to screw that up. The references are few and far between, and to make up for this lack, what few there are are drawn out so as to be ludicrous. I actually fell asleep for the last 10 minutes of the movie, which I cannot ever remember doing. The best part of this movie is that it not even 90 minutes long.PLEASE do yourself a favor, stay away. Stay far away. If you really like torture, save the $10 and just shove bamboo shoots under your fingernails.",Meet the Spartans

The fact that the two director/writers have directed 4 movies, 3 of which have been released, and all 3 happen to be in the worst 100 movies ever made within the IMDb. This has a lot to say about their talent or lack of it don't you think? Also this fact doesn't look good for the 4th movie, the up and coming ""Disaster Movie"" later this year. I predict that this 4th instalment, from these two wannabe's, will meet the same fitting end as the first 3 and end up at around the 70's mark in the worst 100 chart. If you're wondering why I even watched this attempt at comedy, well, the law of averages says that if you do something enough you're bound to get it right eventually.

In the beginning, I wasn't expecting much at all, with the writers coming from doing some pretty pathetic movies. At the start, I was forcing myself to laugh, just because I wanted it to be funny, but then it did something I didn't expect. It actually became funny. What 300 spoof wouldn't be complete with a large amount of gay jokes. This had them all. Even the Fat Guy from Borat. Overall, it was good. Could of been better but its at an acceptable laughter level. Better than any comedy that Ben Stiller has been in. This movie actually makes you laugh. So watch it before you give it a bad rating.

Sometimes it's nice to let your hair down, put aside intelligent thought for an hour and a half, and enjoy some stupid humor. I'd say that we didn't go more than two minutes without laughing at something. There's a lot of pop culture references, and as long as you don't take it too seriously they're quite funny. If you're easily offended do not go see this movie! However, if you're capable of loosening up and laughing unabashedly at idiotic humor you'll have fun. P.S.

I am not saying that this movie is a master piece, but you should watch it with a little bit more positive attitude and not just the one that many users wrote for you to see, and decide not to watch the movie! The actor Sean Maguire did a very good job, and he is a light of this movie. His relaxed attitude and funny jokes made it very interesting for me...

Humor nonexistent (which is rather odd for a parody). I am glad I didn't pay money to see the movie though. That would have been a big mistake. This movie truly sucks. I mean I saw bad movies before, but god damn, this is incredible. A few weeks ago I was searching IMDb trying to find the worst movie ever produced so I could see it out of curiosity. Afterwards I tried finding it on the internet (p2p stuff) and tried downloading but without success. I was just curios to see how bad a movie can suck.

326,burn9003,This movie isn't even bad enough to let you to laugh at how bad it is.,1,16 June 2008,"If this is tl;dr (too long; didn't read), just know this: This movie was not entertaining in the least. Do not watch this movie. Not even for free. Do not let your kids see this movie.I knew it was going to be terrible, since all of these movies are. Scary Movie 1 and 2, and maybe 3 were at least mildly funny. I didn't smile even once during Scary Movie 4. Date Movie, I ignored. Epic Movie just made me angry.I had to see how terrible this one was. I figured; ""hey, maybe there will be a funny part or two"". I was wrong.I couldn't even stomach the whole movie, it was so terrible. I watched this for free on the internet, and shut it off after 20 minutes. I think I got enough of it from the trailers they've been cramming down my throat, though. I actually couldn't watch anymore when they had the Britney Spears thing come on. I had to look away from the screen. Then, shortly after the 10 other people he kicked into the pit, I shut it off. I felt embarrassed to be watching this, even though I was alone.From what I saw, it had no plot, no point, and I counted 20 advertisements in 20 minutes. Something is very wrong here. The jokes were repetitive and overdone. At one point the queen pulls out a laptop (which of course, is a mac) and tells the audience that the movie is a big rip off of 300. Might have been funny if it weren't so expected and done already. It's one thing to parody a few movies. This is just trying to rip off everything it can find.I don't understand how these people can make these movies and get away with so much money! They make a movie that's rated PG-13 with ""humour"" aimed at 10 year old prepubescent boys that laugh at anything that has to do with farting, private parts, puking, and basically anything inappropriate! I guess they figure if they make a movie crappy enough, and everybody goes to see it once, they will make enough money to profit.That being said, if your kid happens to be throwing a birthday party and is begging for you to rent/buy this movie for him/her, don't. It is very inappropriate and despite its humour being aimed at 10 year-olds, it is not suited for anyone under 16. I didn't watch far enough in to see it, but apparently Carmen Electra is naked except for two tomatoes over her nipples and a slice of pizza over her crotch at some point.People, I implore you: stop it. Stop seeing these movies. Don't even go the first day. Don't go AT ALL. Don't buy the DVD. Don't see them. If every person says ""oh I'll just go see it once"", they make enough money to keep doing these movies. If anyone cares to look at the time line, they will notice that each movie by these people is worse than the last. They are not going to improve. Just don't see it. If you simply must see these atrocities, wait for someone to put it on the internet, and watch it for free. Don't give these fools anymore money, or else they will continue to make these movies and they will continue to get worse and worse (if it's even possible to get any worse).The only reason this deserves a one out of ten is because it gets the 1 point for being a movie.",Meet the Spartans

The plot is completely uninteresting and I forced myself to watch the whole movie because I was about to quit after the first 20 minutes but I just wanted to see how it turned out.

At the start of the movie, I tried to laugh at the jokes. But as the film progressed, I found myself actually amazed at how this movie didn't go straight to DVD. Sure, I'll give the makers one or two moments that had a slight bit of humor, but all the jokes were extremely dragged on, to the point that I nearly fell asleep in the middle of a ""joke"". It left me thinking that the film-makers tried way too hard to make people laugh, that they ended up making an unfunny product.I left the cinema feeling ripped off (the first time I had ever felt this about a film).

I feel like less of a human being for having seen this. The directors should probably give up and start directing pornography.. I think it wouldn't be more their forté. This film is an example of how propaganda destroyed the American psyche.

The spin-offs are less abundant in imagination, but still are enjoyable. But this... I just wasn't feeling it. Like a previous commenter said, a certain joke can only be told so many times. Yeah, I get that these people are gay. While it may be funny a first or second time, it gets old fast. There were a few times where I felt like leaving the theater for this very reason.Also, it doesn't help that it attempts to capitalize and embody the worst shows modern television has to offer. If you are a person who can't stand watching: American Idol, MTV's Yo Mamma(real title?), that Deal or No Deal show, or Dancing With the Stars... you will be infuriated by this film.Very rarely do I find myself staring at the credits after a movie, feeling so ripped off.",Meet the Spartans

Had quite a few laughs, my kids especially thought the initial part was funny. What followed was a lot of tedium, punctuated with the obligatory Carmen Electra slow-mo dancing. Unfortunately, the PG-13 keeps them from showing any of Carmen's fine body in the nude. That MIGHT have made me feel like I got some of my money's worth.What drug the movie down also was the tendency to flog any joke to death,especially the Britney spears bit. Basically, you could watch the commercials about 10 times in a row, and that is it. They also had a couple of gags that centered around a blue screen, they beat that one at least three times. They tried in vain to find something funny about the movie three hundred, but let's face it. 300 was almost too serious and action oriented to be spoofed in a sophomoric PG-13 flick.Yeah, they attempted weakly to skewer popular culture, which only means that this movie will have lost all relevancy in about 5 years when the next generation forgets or loses caring over ripping Britney Spears and her pop-culture female counterparts. The bits where they rip Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton were not so much mean spirited as they were weak and desperate attempts at capitalizing on media frenzy. I am pretty much ambivalent about the suffering caused celebrities by parody. I would bet however that Lohan, Spears and Hilton felt not so much skewered by the rapier wit of a comedic genius, as hammered with the blunt tool of a script that appeared to be pounded out by middle schoolers.I don't think that celebs really mind being parodied when there is some real thought and humor behind it, but this clumsy fair was no more than an awful, embarrassing and ham-fisted bit of half-assed character assassination. All the meanness and none of the cleverness.It's been a long time since I have considered asking for my money back, but I would not have wasted another minute on this movie even getting a refund. The time I spent in the theater was a chunk of my life that can never be recovered. This is one of those flicks where if you have seen the commercial, you have seen the highlights already.

Never have i despised 2 individuals such as the discontent i have for both these unimaginative, humourless so called creative minds. How they continue to make movies is beyond me. They have just completed a hat trick with Meet The Spartans, that is, created 3 of the worst movies ever seen in a row. It's an incredible feat. Despite having a free ticket and being begged to attend with a friend (i have closed and terminated that friendship as a result), i still felt ripped off. Actually scrap that, i felt physically abused after viewing this. Stripped of any dignity.And despite this, we still see users on IMDb that actually give this rating more than 1 star (I'd happily hack the website and change the code to allow a zero rating if i could). I'm not sure as to what the mindset is of a person that could find this utter drivel humorous. Perhaps they find the idea of referencing a movie without actually making it any funnier, or on occasions, actually changing the script as a comedic tool. If that fails, let's use gay jokes. If that fails, lets reference again and this time tell the audience what it is we are referencing just in case they didn't laugh the first time. I mean the lack of humour is quite staggering, it actually made me cringe. I think heard more laughs in the cinema whilst watching Requiem For A Dream.I mean to call this movie a spoof is a complete and utter insult to the likes of Airplane! and Spaceballs. In fact, its an insult to the country of America that such a movie could be released. The fact that it made something like $18 million in its opening week perhaps give us an insight as to why America is the focus of terrorism.

I didn't like the ending, where all of them sang ""I'll Survive"" because it just seemed as if they couldn't make any more stuff up...and they had to add in one of those scenes with some credits.(It was pretty lame..)

If you strenuously hate the Date movies, Scary movies or the Epic Movie then what are you doing watching this film? 'Meet The Spartans' is a film that is obviously marketed towards teenagers, and it delivers well to this said group. I actually watched this movie twice, both times the cinema was packed with teens, and everyone was laughing throughout the movie. Memorable scenes, ranging from clever 'Yo Mama' jokes to Britney Spears (She is a joke, yes?) do make this movie worthwhile. There is no great cinematography in the film, but that's hardly expected.

When writing a review i usually include both good and bad aspects of the film however their are no good aspects to this film. The jokes were predictable and in bad taste. The acting was poor to say the least and overall it was simply a dreadful film. I struggled to understand who would actually like this film, no one who possesses an IQ could possibly have found it entertaining.

It was mostly Game Shows (American Idol, Deal or No Deal, Yo Momma) and HORRIBLE HORRIBBLE impressions. Not to mention that half of the previews they showed on TV were deleted scenes during the END CREDITS. WHO DOES THAT??? I want my dollar back. Yea, that's right, I paid a dollar for renting that movie, and I want it back!! All of the scenes that were supposed to be funny were ruined by Kevin Sorbo. Where's he been all this time? Most of the cast was either newer actors, or a bunch of washed up has-beens. Deidrich Bader and Carmen Electra? She must have been desperate for movie roles. She's taking everything that flies her way!! Date Movie, Meet the Spartans, Scary Movie, Scary Movie 4, and pretty much any spoof/parody script, she's doing.

Tonight Me and my friends (we are 14) went to see Meet The Spartans. All I can say is, we had more fun laughing at each other than the movie. There was no story line to it at all. It was filled with advertisements from companies like Coke and Gatorade. There were a couple funny parts but not enough to keep you focused. Not enough parodies. We read tons of reviews online and all of them had low ratings but we didn't believe them. We thought they just didn't have a sense of humor. We were wrong, this movie didn't have a sense of humor. Lots of scenes in the trailer are not in the movie. When the movie started there was only about 20 other people in the theater. When the credits started at the end. At the most 10 were left.So no, PLEASE believe me. Take this from a 14 year old guy who laughs at everything, don't waste your money on this. Go see something better like Cloverfield.",Meet the Spartans

That's exactly what I got, couple of good laughs and some fun while watching this. The acting, writing and directing is pretty much what I expect from this kind of parody, not great, but does the job. The jokes were easy to spot, so you probably wont miss a thing even if you take a bathroom break and leave the movie running. A lot of the jokes were on the media, commercials and off-course modern movies, mainly 300.

There were rarely any bright moments in this film as the humor became more and more demented as the film continued.

I thought that, for the most part it was funny, so did the rest of the audience. Unlike Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans actually follows the story of 300 from start to finish with spoofs and parodies mixed in. Some parts of the movie however seem like they were added because they had nothing else to put there. An example of that would be the part with Carmen Electra in a spider man suit hanging from the building.

Now i know I should probably dig through other <5 rated comedies, seeing this pearl has gotten such a low score.First of all, don't look for plot. It's there, it just doesn't care. Subtlety? Fuhgeddaboutit. The whole movie is like Mel Brooks on steroids. And don't say that this is hardly worthy of comparison with Mel Brooks. It's all the same humour, just that you were younger when you watched Mel Brooks and it was funnier then. OK maybe the plot is something Mel Brooks movies' do have, but the jokes are similar - completely absurd and arbitrary references, anachrony, bizarre jokes and a bit of slapstick humour. It's supposed to be corny. You're supposed to be used to that.Second of all, it's a parody. A good ol' 80's style parody. Which means that some of the spoofs will just be an exaggeration of actual scenes from the original. No punchline. No meta-joke. Just a funny guy who speaks in an 'epic' accent who gets in a battle of wits (yo momma jokes) with Xerxes' RUN-DMC shirted crew. Stuff like that. Anyway, the acting is bad, the montage is frantic, storyline vague.. But that was never the point. It's gag after gag after gag. You'll see all pop culture and modern references you can imagine, which will completely set you off from the ""original plot"". Yeah right.Just think of the 80s, and remember your first impression of Hot Shots 2. This was even better.",Meet the Spartans
356,bernardos70,Why can't it be given a 0?,1,25 January 2008,"IMDb gets better and better everyday. Not only are movies listed, there are also TV shows, and now they even list Meet The Spartans. Meet The Spartans isn't a movie, you see. This piece of film actually is quite revolting. It leaves you wondering who the target audience might be: some jokes are pretty gross, to the point no non-adult audience should be able to watch it. The remainder of the jokes aren't funny, so no able minded adult individuals would possibly find entertainment in them.Meet The Spartans has two types of jokes: 1) Gross-out, non funny jokes; and 2) non-gross-out jokes, which are just as unfunny. Even by the standards set by recent Fox spoof movies, this fails epically. I could not honestly tell you 1 joke which made anyone laugh at the theater I was in. It was confusing. It was gross. It was revolting. But funny, it was not.The production level of this..... thing..... is absolutely non-existent. The most anti-funny parts of the movie are actually the longest. The dance sketch which you see for about 5 seconds in the ads actually lasts a good 5-7 minutes. The song at the end lasts about another 5 minutes. A 'yo-momma' jokes battle is also in the movie, and they manage to somehow get that wrong, with the 'yo-momma' jokes being some of the most unfunny 'yo-momma' jokes I have ever heard. I could honestly come up with funnier versions of this joke on the spot. This movie has cheap written all over it, which would be OK if any comedy was to be found within.Do yourself a favor and don't go watch this. No, not even if you just read this review and said to yourself ""wow, how terrible could it possibly be? I must watch it!""

I would actually rather watch something like Jerry Springer because it has more intelligence than this. And I really hate Jerry Springer. It almost seems like a joke that it was so terrible. I cant imagine the writers of this film or the actors having any kind of pride in it. It had about all the plot quality and acting skill as a porno.

There was the odd part where I might have cracked a smile or thought, ""This might be funny if..."" but there is a very good reason for that. Instead of making good jokes and thoughtful humour, the writers decided to just constantly send an endless stream of jokes at you and hoped one of them made you chuckle.

It is PG-13 but I feel anyone under 16 should not see it, in one scene Carmen Electra is laying on a table with only tomatoes covering her nipples and a slice of pizza covering her crotch.

Xerxes was son of Darius the Great of Persia and Atossa, the daughter of Cyrus the Great. After his accession in October 485 BC, he suppressed the revolts in Egypt and Babylon that had broken out the year before and appointed his brother Achaemenes as governor or satrap over Egypt (Old Persian: khshathrapavan). In 484 BC, he took away from Babylon the golden statue of Bel (Marduk, Merodach), the hands of which the legitimate king of Babylon had to seize on the first day of each year, and killed the priest who tried to hinder him. Therefore Xerxes does not bear the title of King in the Babylonian documents dated from his reign, but King of Persia and Media or simply King of countries (i.e. of the world). This proceeding led to two rebellions, probably in 484 BC and 479 BC. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerxes_I_of_Persia",Meet the Spartans

It should have been longer and more creative. I had such high expectations from the previews but after about half way through the movie, it was difficult to give praise to the attempted humor.

If you like your irony a little more subtle - AVOID! Must admit, I did enjoy seeing all those unsavory characters flung into the pit of death, that's why it got a 3 instead of a 2. Good to see Sean Maguire on screen again, haven't seen him since Grange Hill. Shame it was in this film.",Meet the Spartans
379,hanyo,A funny movie,6,12 March 2008,"Well, I think the movie was good. Of course its a parody on some other movies, but if you like other parody movies like ""Scary Movie"", you'll probably like it too. I can ignore the fact that the movie was made on low budget, and some scenes and locations are made simple and cheap because of it. You can't expect every movie to be a Hollywood-blockbuster production. This movie makes even fun of those digital-enhanced films. The storyline is pretty simple and follows the events of the film ""300"". After seeing ""Meet The Spartans"", I think they made some scenes even better (and funnier too) then the original scenes from ""300"". So if you don't mind low budget films and like parody, you should watch this one.",Meet the Spartans
380,xsix88,Twisted humor will crack you up,10,6 April 2008,"This movie made me laugh so hard I had to stand up, I do not understand how this movie could get such a low rating, I guess we are just very few people on this site that share this sense of humor. You would, like the other movies produced by the same people, need to have seen the movies they are making fun with, in order to find this movie even more funny. This movie is like one big laugh, you can barely catch your breath before the next thing crack you up, you would have to be extremely dull if you do not find this movie the slightest big funny. This twisted form of humor is just so great, and the way things happen in the movie is truly epic, you constantly get surprised of the makers ways of introducing stuff, you just sit back laugh and wonder how the hell did they come up with stuff like that. If you are sort of a movie geek, and have good humor, this is one of the funniest movies you can watch these days.",Meet the Spartans

The film also seemed very short and was disappointed with the parts they had cut out. The directors are from the Scary Movie series, but this film seems weak, compared to the humour in the Scary Movies. I think the directors were trying to make it open for more audiences by making it a 12a. Overall, the film was funny from beginning to end, but very low budgeted.Hopefully when the DVD is realised it will come with the missed out features that were not included in the movie.",Meet the Spartans
382,ehstomcat,Waste of Time and Money,1,9 April 2008,"Meet the Spartans was released in 2008, and offered the same kind of spoof that Epic Movie made, which was made in 2007. Both of these movies made fun of celebrities and other movies released a year or two before they had the chance to show it on the big screen. For example, Meet the Spartans was released in 2008, but made fun of the movie 300, which was released in 2007. Both Epic Movie and Meet the Spartans are awful movies, and only feature a couple moments of laughter,(if any) and small cracks. Meet the Spartans is also filled with completely random scenes in a hope to make you laugh. As if the random scenes aren't enough, the credits also show small clips of the movie that wasn't seen in the beginning, and they are just as random and unfunny as the other scenes in the movie. Almost every joke in the movie, is either refferenced to pop culture, or some kind of sick, dirty joke. With a terrible story line,annoying jokes and humor, the only thing that you'll be laughing at when watching Meet the Spartans is at yourself, for realizing that you have wasted about $10 to see a movie that completely wastes your time, and doesn't make you laugh at the same time. The only people who will be laughing at this kind of humor, are usually young audiences. (pre-teens to teens) It is unfortunate to see movies like Date Movie, Epic Movie and Meet the Spartans, are wasting everybody's time and money, and even if any of these movies were to go on DVD for a dollar, it wouldn't even be a good buy, and the movies are even more worthless than 1 dollar.

Even the laughs in the trailer are ruined by the garbage that actually surrounds it in the actual movie. If this movie were 30 seconds long i would have given it a 10. How can you ruin a scene where brittany spears is kicked into a bottomless pit? unwatchable. yea and alright i friggin get it its easy to make gay jokes about Greek soldiers. no reason to waste millions of dollars and 2hrs of my life nailing that point down. Jesus how many lines do they want me to put down here. I suppose i can continue to bad mouth this steaming pile of garbage.

384,anakai360,The worst movie I've ever seen.......it made me feel sad >:'(,1,25 April 2008,"(**********this review contains spoilers*****************)This is officially the worst movie I've ever seen.....seriously retarded acting, lame predictable jokes and most of all, this movie just doesn't know when to stop! It instantly makes a joke about the Spartans being gay or whatever but, then instead of coming up with something original, repeat that joke over and over and over again. Next to that, you have your mediocre advertisement jokes where, the spartans drink Gatorade or Coca Cola or whatever. Another part that keeps coming back are look-a-likes and trust me...they're the worst you'll ever see on the big screen! >:( It comes down to the point that, most of the look-a-likes/randoms are kicked into the ""deathpit"". (Taken from the seen where Leonidas kicks Xerxes messenger into a pit.) This joke might make you smile a bit even though it was predictable but, again just like the Gay-jokes, it is used over and over again! After a while (about halfway through...) I actually started to feel embarrassed for watching this movie......YES it is that bad! Let me point something out here, there's nothing wrong with a bad movie, a B-action movie with flimsy special effects can be rather funny if watched with a couple of friends and a good amount of beverage :)This movie on the contrary is so distasteful, half-ass, downright stupid, that it makes you wish that you could get your money back... I've wasted 84 min of my live and 8 euros and I want 'em back JASON FRIEDBERG!I hope they somehow make a law that bans this guy from ever producing/directing a movie again! I hope this guy gets charged by NIKE for making a bad joke about their brand and so loses his career, his home and his liv....ah, I'm ranting x)Jason Friedberg, if you read this........give me my money back!rating -10000000/10 ....oh wait that's not possible :S (can't their be some sort exception made for this movie...please IMDb mods, we need your help!) ps.

I honestly thought they could have made something at least slightly watchable when lampooning 300 (Which is practically a parody in itself); instead, Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer have made what is clearly nothing more than a weak collection of jokes, purely for their own self-gain. Let's face it; if Friedberg and Seltzer were not doing this movie purely for monetary gain, they would most likely not keep resorting to YouTube humour and body gags.

Knowing the kind of movie it was, and having seen 300 and various other movie references, I found ""Meet the Spartans"" to have given me what I came for; some good laughs, a chuckle here and there and kept up with the current themes of today. Next, the humor in it is a specific type - the ones that follow the ""Date Movie"", ""Scary Movie"", etc... so know that going in or else you might not have a pleasant experience.When the movie ended, I felt my stomach tighten up again.

HOWEVER, this movie was so stupid it was just, well stupid, bordering on complete irritation. There were a number of kids in the theater and I can't say that I heard a single one laugh. A movie that is supposed to be funny and can't get a twelve year old to even giggle is pretty sad. I've never felt so compelled to walk from the theater before a film was over. It really is that bad.

Was this written by backup writers from kindergarten while the real writers were on strike or something?

We are talking about a film that has Carmen Electra wearing only a pizza slice and 2 tomatoes (and calling it a spa) , gay jokes that no one younger than 24 should see, music culture parodies (parodies? not even that!!!) that no one over 30 would understand, script quality that is a trillion times worse than a 5 year olds ''my day at the park'' essay. hell, that essay would be 3 times more funny and 10 times more interesting.

392,rykel26-2,Only a blank screen would've been worse.... Maybe.,1,12 June 2008,"You know a movie will be bad when the funny parts of the commercial weren't even funny.Throughout this whole movie, I honestly think they used maybe three sets. I wondering if this was intentional, due to budget, or maybe on purpose (Though it's never mentioned in the movie).Now, this is billed as a 'comedy', which usually means humor. Maybe the writers didn't get that memo. This has as much humor as... An ER? Possibly. The only attempts at ""humor"" (and yes, it deserves to be quoted) in this movie are references. I can't imagine the ""brainstorming"" session the writers must've had: -""Okay, now they just talked to an enemy, what should we include to make this funny?"" -""Let's put the American Idol judges in! They are from real life, so its funny!"" (Though, judging from the script, they probably used smaller words) Now, I have no problem with advertising in movies, or in video games for that matter. It seems to make it more realistic. (I'd rather a character eat at a TGI Friday's instead of a Wednesday's). But it's just plain blatant advertising here. After a character is stranded in the Arctic (or, going back to poor set design, a floor with cotton and white confetti on it), he only survives by seeing a Subway sub on the ground. Humorous? No. Advertisement? Yes.Well, if you want about 80 wasted minutes of your life wasted, pick this up.

394,dwleckel,Love it or hate it?,9,15 July 2008,"I have to say I've seldom seen a movie that brought out so many comments at opposite ends of the spectrum. Every one I've read either enjoyed it completely or hated it intensely. I, for one, thought it was very entertaining and a great laugh. For me, a spoof is a movie that takes scenes from serious movies and throws in something that makes them truly ridiculous without distorting them to the point where they're unrecognizable. Meet the Spartans accomplishes that. Also, this movie parodies a particular movie(the 300) rather than poking fun at an entire genre like the Naked Gun series or the last three Scary Movies. To my mind it's a lot harder to find something funny about almost every part of a movie. In Meet the Spartans, every scene has a recognizable counterpart in the original movie(except maybe the Transformer)and each is spoofed to within an inch of it's life! As for those complaining about a never ending series of homosexual jokes, let's face it-the movie takes place in ancient Greece and even the original 300 refers to the Athenians as ""boy lovers and philosophers"". So what did you expect? I will grant that the naming of some characters is going too far. If there's anyone who hasn't seen American Idol enough to recognize the parody, they probably won't see this movie either. The only drawback to Meet the Spartans is that you have to see the 300 to truly appreciate what lengths the creators went to in order to make the scenes, characters and scenery itself match the original, and to really catch all the humor. I own both movies and I find that watching the parody makes me want to see the original again. Isn't that the mark of a true parody?",Meet the Spartans

I wonder why Lionsgate even think of giving them the money to do what secondary school children can do better. A school stage play I once saw was even better than this, even when the backdrop fell over their heads and half of them cried. The jokes are so stale. One can tell a joke once or twice and it still can be funny but after the 7th time it gets annoying. Maybe the reason why this movie dwells so much on one gag (albeit not a funny one, e.g. the dance-off, the deathly kick to the pits - all 53 of them, the game show references etc...) is because the set was so elaborately and painstakingly built, (and the dancers were so highly paid) they were trying so hard to milk every single lame gag they could think of and make full use (or abuse) of it. This movie has no particular direction, other than the one from the original movie, and definitely requires no talent whatsoever to make and I won't be surprised Friedberg and Seltzer would re-spoof this movie again given the chance.

That seems to be the full content of the movie just poor jokes all the way through. The first Scary Movie film was actually quite good but they have went downhill dramatically since and this is just the worst of them all.A question that needs asking is why does everything have to be so funny, why not have some more actual film content - I mean I don't mind spoof movies, 'Just Another Teen Movie' was great, Scary Movie 1 was good but this is genuinely garbage.

Even if you're into the kind of sad humor this movie features, 'Meet the Spartans' will fail to surprise you a single time, and thus, fall flat.A major ingredient of 'Meet the Spartan'-humor is the idea that anything can be funny if you add a famous name, however, just trying to be funny by randomly insulting celebrities is a very cheap way to produce laughter. People will laugh when they recognize the celebrity-look-alike on screen without thinking.I'm not trying to insult the people who made 'Meet the Spartans'.

And remember the tasteless idiots responsible for this travesty are also responsible for Disaster movie, date movie and scary movie. I can not understand why these people are allowed to continually make these films.The acting isn't much better, there is not one person in this fill who i wouldn't give a razzy to, they were appalling. Not even one of the actors in it were remotely gifted, of course it was not helped that none of their characters had an one bit of charisma or charm. It is an ugly attempt to just use a series of you tube clips, act them out and call them characters.The only way i didn't give it a 1 is because: 1-The begging was not too bad, it even made me smile, but when they got onto the stupid gay jokes it was the begging of the end. 2-1 Is reserved for the very worst of the worst and only Superbabies 2 gets that.This infantile piece of crap should never have been made, it is immature, vulgar and not even funny. 300 is not a good film and deserves a spoof but this just makes a average film look good.

It frankly disgusts me that these people were given millions of dollars to produce such utter shite. I laughed once throughout the entire film at a line delivered in approximately the first 2 minutes, the rest was embarrassing and insulting to watch. I can justify watching an awful film if I can laugh at it, such as 'House of the Dead', which despite being a train wreck of a film was actually unintentionally quite funny. However, Meet the Spartans despite aiming to be funny was frankly excruciating to watch. All I could think of throughout was that I was slowly losing an hour of my life and £5.50 that I would never see again.The jokes are immature and at times homophobic. The humour is basically trash that I'm almost certain could and would have only appealed to a group of 15 year old boys. Upon leaving the cinema I have never seen such a depressed group of people. The movie is from the same writers as 'Date Movie', 'Epic Movie' and the Scary Movie films. I personally am quite a fan of the Scary Movie films and thought I would give this the benefit of the doubt despite being very disappointed with 'Date Movie'. I have however learnt my lesson now and shall be investing no more money into watching any of Jason Friedberg or Aaron Seltzers films.The cast is not particularly promising but neither did I expect it to be a death sentence. Sean Maguire and Carmen Electra both star in the main roles, but I personally don't think the casting had anything to do with the fall down of this film, nothing could have saved this. The script is frankly appalling, the story is messy and the humour is just offensive; sadly not in a tongue in cheek way. I think that Mr. Friedberg and Mr. Seltzer need to learn the use of subtly. Sometimes less really is more. It seemed with this film everything including the jokes had to be taken to the extreme.

410,brock_elvis,An Underrated Comedy,7,2 September 2013,"Personally, I enjoyed the film, the structure of the gags were quite amusing, and the pop culture references delivered to the viewer were executed perfectly. I got quite a good laugh out of the movie, but some parts did disappoint me for I haven't become familiar towards half of the comedic spin-offs presented. Too many of the reviews on this website degrade it for little to no reason, all they say is ""IT'S A HORRIBLE MOVIE, DON'T WATCH IT LOL"", except in a longer context.In my opinion, the movie was great, the story actually had meaning except in a satirical view. If you're gonna buy the movie, I suggest the Uncut Version, the extra content is absolutely wonderful and will give you more reason to watch the whole thing.",Meet the Spartans
411,theasikkala,An awful waste of time.,1,14 March 2008,"Meet The Spartans not only proves that you can still go lower from Epic Movie, it also makes you wonder who is to blame. Someone paid to see this film, despite having seen the advertisements. Someone believed spending money in a collection of awful jokes and what might have been called pop culture references if they had any depth was the right thing to do. If you walked up to a random child and asked him/her to write a short summary for an original movie script, you'd get better results than Meet The Spartans.It is just that bad. Do everyone a favor, do not support the makers of this movie. Do not see it, buy it or rent it. Forget it even exists.Meet The Spartans is a new low for the American film industry.",Meet the Spartans
412,nebster_89,worst movie ever,1,29 January 2008,Carmen Electra is a whore just like she is in all her movies this movie was so terrible that we had to sneak into 2 other movies to make up for the money that we wasted on that one. every single funny scene is on the previews ..not only that...half the movie is in the previews it was only an hour and a half there was no point to it at all. its just a cheap repeat of every single movie they have made like this. only they are really losing their touch.The humor is awful and instead of laughing it mostly made me sick. If I could contain my disgust and sum this movie up with one word it would simply be...Crap But don't let my words discourage you go see for yourself. or don't waste your time and money and go see a better movie,Meet the Spartans
413,peacenow-147-384529,don't know where to begin,1,31 October 2014,"Overwhelmingly sexist. Not just to women but also men. Closely followed by a whole horde of homophobia and racism. If you find it funny you're an awful human being. The references to other pop culture is okay, but could be better. Better if it wasn't so offensive. Be prepared for bad paint and photo shop, bad lines about stereotypical homosexuals and stereotypical female roles. If there's irony in it I failed to see it. The sexism and racism combine in a completely inappropriate comment about Muslim women's attire, and Carmen's character does not help the situation. Offensive on every front. 0/10 for me!",Meet the Spartans
414,djrollex,Stay away at ALL COSTS!,1,26 January 2008,"This is one of those movies that will make the top 10 worst comedies of all time list. The humor, if you can even call that, will be found funny by pre-pubescent boys and girl at best. I fell asleep during the second half of the movie, because I could not take watching it anymore and my friend (who was driving) was still watching. NOTHING in this movie was funny, not even one part. However, you will see 3 blatant commercials during the movie, literally. This is the type of the movie that will show 3 funny things in the commercial and those will be THE ONLY funny parts in the WHOLE movie, but I didn't even find those funny, because in the real movie they are NOT.Please, don't waste your time.",Meet the Spartans
415,AngelofMusic0707,Dreadful!,2,3 February 2008,"This movie seriously depressed me. Epic movie gave me a few laughs, dismal as it was, Date Movie made me giggle a bit, && even The Scary Movies were something of a riot. But this...this one was terrible, even for the series' standards.The Stomp the Yard spoof was entirely too long. It was only funny for about the first ten seconds. After that it was awkward, because you knew you were suppose to be laughing, but it just wasn't funny.The pit of death was the only truly funny bit, for me. But the constant reference to popular TV reality shows quickly became tiresome. They weren't original or funny.This movie wasn't good at all, not by any standards. I went to this movie hoping to be laughing the whole time, but instead I was wishing I had better invested my $7.",Meet the Spartans
416,PoopdeckCaptain,best movie ever,10,3 February 2008,"So I just got back and from seeing Meet the Spartans and I have to say that it is possibly the greatest movie that I have ever seen. I mean, I thought 300 was just an awful movie and the action was just plain boring.Meet the Spartans had some of the best action sequences ever. And Kevin Sorbo, come on, possible one of the best supporting actors of the year. He definitely better not get snubbed at the Oscars.Pros: 1. Kevin Sorbo 2. excellent ""yo mama"" battles that were even too great for 8 mile. 3. The fat kid with no eyes 4. Xerxes, played by ""the Borat guy"" 5. Paris Hilton jokes (I never get tired of hearing about her) 6. The excessive gay references 7. and of course, Kevin Sorbo.Cons: 1. It just wasn't long enough. There was so much humor packed into one short film.I suggest that everyoone see this movie, especially if you have some kind of mental disorder12/10!",Meet the Spartans
417,esutko,Stupid beyond belief but not painful,1,6 March 2016,"I watched this movie as I marathoned the IMDb bottom 100, so I now how much movies can hurt. this movie does not hurt me. It has no self contained plot, and after five minutes of euphoric high caused by an almost its so bad its good, my brain adjusted to the randomness of the film I just watched it and attempted to guess the jokes before they happened for the remaining 55 minutes. My opinion on it is that it was a complete and utter waste of time, and the only reason it gets one star instead of three is that I PAID FIVE DANG DOLLARS FOR IT. I could go onto Youtube watch a summary of 300, the movie this is ripping off, then a video of a grown man crapping his pants in public, and finish it off by starring at a wall for an hour and get the same experience. They didn't even let me rent it on amazon, they made me buy it so that when I am watching a movie with friends I will have to explain why MEET THE SPARTANS is in my movie library. As a side note I watched this with two other people who both claim it was the worst movie they have ever seen and was so painful to watch one of them dropped out of the marathon. My theory is that this movie did not hurt me because I am a cynical nihilist who is not surprised that such horrors could be put to celluloid. So in conclusion I would not suggest this movie to anyone and if it doesn't cause you unimaginable pain it will leave a nauseous feeling because you will have to live the wrest of your life knowing you gave money to these soulless hacks.",Meet the Spartans
418,stabbed_with_a_guitar,Absolutely unfunny in every way ever.,1,23 March 2008,"In the most unoriginal movie of the decade, a sparse, vague plot involving 13 Spartans battling a Persian army at Thermopylae, which (is it funny already?) consists mainly of the most clumsy, inept pop culture references of anything popular since December 2006.From the moment we see Shrek as one of the Spartan babies being inspected, it is more than obvious that whatever money anyone spent on this film was a complete waste and should be refunded with an apology.Yes, it is that bad. I only found myself seeing it because I attended a movie marathon and this happened to be included in this discounted ticket price. And it was still a rip-off.This film is a shame to the already severely failing genre of spoof. It is not clever in any way, and the only decent writing in any part of the film are lines directly taken from 300. I hypothesise that these films- Meet the Spartans, Epic Movie and Date Movie- follow the world's most mind-numbing formula;1. Take movies that have been relatively decent or popular, that people have thought about spoofing and have done so correctly on some occasions, and therefore YOU should not touch, because YOU will fail epically. 2. Strip the plot/s down to the barest, often irrelevant aspects, leaving plenty of room (hopefully at least, in the case of Meet the Spartans, 55 minutes for inane references to everything unfunny ever)for material that is not related to the plot in any way.3. Make a list of every film that has been relatively popular for the last few years, and make a list of everything that is irrelevant to the plot of the spoof, but is popular to the film, and find ways to pop it in the spoof with the subtlety and skill of a 3 year old painting with a cat. You MUST mention EXACTLY where the parody is coming from. An obviously offhand comment ""You've got HAPPY FEET"" or a casual complete zoom in to Rocky's iconic boxing shorts, reading ""ROCKY"" should do the trick nicely. 4. Make a list of obviously very funny things such as people repeatedly getting hurt (Yeah, repeated child abuse in Meet The Spartans is ever-so-funny) and be sure to drag it out AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. Use this philosophy with every unfunny gag in the film. AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. I'm talking at least 10 minutes of the same thing here. 5. Release as a film. It doesn't have to be funny in any way for it to make money. Surely the world has gone downhill and died, its rotting remains appearing to be the very stuff this film is made of. Almost everything in the whole film that is parodied (and I use that term with as little discretion as possible) can be seen in the trailers, and even with the limited time in a trailer, it still sucks.I think I need a drink.",Meet the Spartans
419,dontsimon,"Boycott this movie, for the good of the world",1,23 March 2008,"I refused to see this movie for obvious reasons. To be fair, I rated it based on the trailer (a generous 1, give is zero IMDb!!) I didn't need to see any more than that. If you think that's narrow minded of me, well maybe you could fill me in on what happens?I also voted it 1 in the hope that it might help stop such films being made. As Mark Kermode said this week ""If you pay to go and see that kind of movie, it's your fault when they do it next time. It's a personal responsibility issue, there is no excuse."" Perhaps some will say ""No one's forcing you to see it, it's just a bit of fun."" Well that's bull. There are thousands of incredible screenplays and supremely talented filmmakers out there, and only a finite amount of film capital to be had. Think of the dozen or so beautiful indie movies that could have been made with the budget used for this.This kind of dross is cynical, depressing, bandwagon jumping studio zombie fodder. And judging by the trailers, about as funny as a cot death.",Meet the Spartans
420,musicman1174,HORRIBLE! I agree with this review,1,28 January 2008,"I saw this review and could not possibly agree with these guys more. F THESE GUYS! F THIS MOVIE!!!! UGh, what a waste of film, time and space. When will the studios learn??? Seriously, i've never had such a visceral reaction to any movie before. I thought things like Epic Movie were bad. That makes THIS look like The Godfather. And the worst, most hateful part about this is that it was NUMBER ONE at the box office this weekend. NUMBER ONE?! It's about time that people stop going to see the filth that Hollywood is putting out. It's getting to the point where it's not even worth leaving the house for 2 hours for this sh*t, let alone lay down your heard earned money for it. If you get 2 minutes, check this out.

421,maichalfared,Not worth a dime!,2,12 February 2008,I actually watched this movie thinking that most people here on IMDb were just jumping on the 'this movie sucks' bandwagon and that it couldn't be as bad as people claimed it was.There is absolutely NO comedy in this movie whatsoever.. it's just pure and pure nonsense that could only make 3-year olds laugh. Scenes are stretched out FAR too long and that would be OK if they were fun or interesting but it's just boredom.I do not remember myself laughing once during this movie. I could not even manage to get off an innocent smile. It's just horrible.I'd say the only good thing about this movie would be Carmen Electra but since there are 'interesting' pics of her all over the internet that's a minus as well.DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!,Meet the Spartans
422,harrald-polet,holy crap :-s,1,20 March 2008,"too horrible to think about this auditory and visual disaster.if you consider watching this; here is a list of things I recommend instead:1. invite some friends and have a glass of good wine 2. jump of a cliffand all things in between, which means; all the good and bad things you can do in life are way better than watching this piece of crap.the humor was not funny but offensive, the movie that was used as framework is too good to use for a spoof, carmen electra is getting way to old for these ""roles"" and the only pretty girl in the movie was made to look like lindsay lohan... WHY???for the producers: do yourself and us a favour, quit the movie business",Meet the Spartans
423,Silversteinzero,A epic fail,1,4 June 2008,The only satisfaction you will get from this flick is if you pick this movie up and give it to the person you hate most. That way you can feel as if you murdered apart of them when they watch it.If for some morbid reason you still feel the need to watch this or are just mildly retarded.I would go with the ladder and just stab yourself in the face a few dozen times. Not only will it be more entertaining you will be less bored.In fact your friends will find it more comical than this film.If you are Hardcore and wish to test your willpower and endurance this is the perfect movie. I will advise however it will shave 5 yrs off your life. Do you know how it feels to be loved? If so watch this and you will know how it feels to be worthless. Do you know what it feels like to be worthless? Well watch this and you will probably off yourself.,Meet the Spartans

425,jj_nine,Worst movie i've seen in a theater,1,26 January 2008,"I was recently forced to sit through Meet the Spartans. Ill start by saying that i'm very sick of all this epic/date/scary movie junk. It's been overdone and only appeals to people under the age of 9. The humor in this movie was just as awful as i thought it would be and i could predict the entire movie. I was told before-hand that it was only about 90 minutes, and was a little upset id be paying for that. After watching the movie i was beyond glad that i only had to be tortured for that long, rather than the usual 2 hours. I'll close by saying that if you're forced to watch this movie, rip your eyes out of your skull and pour salt into your head. It will be much more enjoyable.",Meet the Spartans
