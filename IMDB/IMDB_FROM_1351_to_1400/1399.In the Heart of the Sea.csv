0,MartinHafer,Exceptionally well made...,9,1 May 2016,"The story is about the Essex, a whaling ship that was, amazingly, sunk by a whale. The story is told through a flashback from one of the survivors of the journey and follows them from just before the cruise through their eventual rescue and return to Nantucket.While ""In the Heart of the Sea"" is a bit overlong, it is a tremendously well made film. The script, not surprisingly, takes a few liberties with the actual story but is, overall, essentially factual*. But what really blew me away was the look of the film-- the 1820 New England landscape, the ship and the whale attacks. While you know that most of this was done using CGI, you simply cannot tell by looking at it...it looks so amazingly real.*Several liberties were taken. A big one is the way the story is told--by the one survivor of the Essex affair back in 1950 who relates his story to Herman Melville. Well, this didn't happen...but it does make for a neat way to tell the story, so I didn't mind this. Additionally, First Mate Chase and his post-Essex life are COMPLETELY different from the way they're portrayed in the film. In each case, the changes were made to make the film more cinematic and enjoyable but also remind you that the actual story is a tad different.",In the Heart of the Sea
1,Leofwine_draca,Old-fashioned adventure with an overload of CGI,6,14 April 2018,"IN THE HEART OF THE SEA is an energetic and old-fashioned high seas adventure directed by Ron Howard and based on the same true story that inspired Herman Melville to write MOBY DICK. Unfortunately this leads to an extensive framing narrative involving Brendan Gleeson's salty old sea-dog and Ben Whishaw playing Melville, seeking material for his next novel. At times the narrative will be in the heart of the action before jumping back to the present, but they should have dropped this flabby extension of the running time all together to focus on the main story. It's the usual tale of survival at sea against the odds, with a battle against an abnormally large whale making up the heart of the narrative. Unfortunately, Howard gets obsessed with CGI here and at times the film is nothing more than a series of shots of actors against a green screen interacting with CGI. Still, the human drama is quite engrossing, and the cast is surprisingly good; Hemsworth flexs his acting chops unshackled from THOR, while Cillian Murphy, Joseph Mawle, Tom Holland and Frank Dillane all get their moments to shine.",In the Heart of the Sea
2,SnoopyStyle,missing the heart,6,12 April 2016,"In 1850, writer Herman Melville arrives in Nantucket Island to interview Tom Nickerson (Brendan Gleeson) about the lost of the whaling ship Essex. Tom was a young man when he joined the ship. George Pollard is the inexperienced captain from an established family. Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth) is the experienced first mate who is looked down on and driven to captain his own boat. Matthew Joy (Cillian Murphy) is Owen's mate. The ship travels beyond the regular hunted-out grounds and faces a truly dangerous whale.Director Ron Howard delivers a visual experience combining an old oil painting and modern CGI. He adds in flares of closeups that is unique but not necessarily exciting. Some scenes remind me of an old 50s lifeboat movie. Some scenes are fully modern CGI. The action works well but it is simply missing the heart. It is missing the human emotion. It's the opposite of Melville's classic which is all about the human condition. The movie ends with the weakest of dilemma which nobody cares about. This should be all about an action survival movie. There are some beautiful looking but not that thrilling action scenes. The story could use a real villain and some more human conflicts.",In the Heart of the Sea
3,Hitchcoc,Intense Tale of Survival,7,14 February 2017,"I am a huge fan of Moby Dick. I've taught it as a novel; I've read it several times. Its artistry is beyond measure. Herman Melville certainly knew his stuff when it came to whaling and the sea. Apparently, Melville gained his inspiration from a particular whaling voyage that produced fodder for his imagination. This film takes the fictional Melville back to the time where he heard the story of the white whale. If one looks at the book as the allegory it is, we put the stamp of whiteness and all the implications of the color (or lack of it) that it implies. This movie takes any artistry out of the story. Ahab lost his leg and pursues the elusive cetacean in the ultimate act of revenge. Here, a bunch of guys get in over their heads. They had an overzealous captain who simply was out for the commercial value of the animal. When the whale destroys the ship (they do give him supernatural powers) part of the crew is in whaleboats, trying to get someplace safe. Terrible things happen, including cannablism, and some manage to hold off their fates till they are rescued. But there is something dull about the pacing of the story. We aren't made privy to much of what goes on among them. There are the obligatory sacrifices that are not new to this genre. It's a decent movie, but a better script and some more personal depth would have helped.",In the Heart of the Sea
4,Prismark10,Just too washy,6,12 November 2016,"Over the years Ron Howard film have tended to become more portentous and duller. A sense of perkiness and fun from his 1980s films has gone up in smoke.In the Heart of the Sea is told in flashback by one of the last survivors of the crew of the Essex, Thomas Nickerson (Brendon Gleeson) is a crusty sea dog who recounts to the author Herman Melville his adventures in his youth as the Essex was searching for whales whose oil was valued. Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth) is the veteran second in command, respected by his crew but not deemed worthy enough to captain a whaling ship despite his skills and knowledge. George Pollard (Benjamin Walker) is given the task of captaining the Essex because he has the heritage and financial backing but is inexperienced and his mistakes lead to clashes with Chase.The crew struggle to get the required whale oil to be deemed a successful voyage and travel thousands of miles further to an area where there are reputed whale sightings only to encounter a giant sperm whale that wreaks havoc and the crew are stranded fighting for survival with the whale tormenting the men.The film is a soggy old fashioned tale of survival against the odds, a story which inspired the novel Moby Dick but the characters are thinly sketched and the film has the horrid teal colour grading with some iffy CGI.",In the Heart of the Sea
5,nogodnomasters,"WE'RE YOUR FAMILY, FOR BETTER OR WORSE. MOSTLY WORSE.",10,16 April 2018,"This is a slightly embellished story of the whaling ship Essex which was sunk by a Sperm Whale in 1820. This story was the inspiration for Melville's ""Moby Dick."" In the film Melville (Ben Whishaw) interviews the adult Thomas Nickerson (Brendan Gleeson) who spends his time in a bottle and is reluctant to tell his tale of woe. However his fourth wife (Michelle Fairley) convinces him because of their pecuniary predicament. Thomas was a 14 year old ""Greenhorn"" (Tom Holland) at the time and tells the story as a conflict between the privileged captain George Pollard (Benjamin Walker) and a disgruntle first mate Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth) who was promised his own ship. As Pollard remarks, ""Some are born to the job, some born into it."" Thomas experiences his first ""Nantucket sleigh ride"" and gets to do all the dirty jobs.If you know the story they encounter a ""demon"" whale who hunts and haunts them.The story was well done and well acted if slightly inaccurate. Both Chase and Nickerson wrote accounts of the story and Melville used Chase's account for his inspiration. The interview appears to be fiction. There is a late emotional scene involving the Captain's cousin that wasn't quite accurate, but the results were the same.Good sea drama and half decent action flick.",In the Heart of the Sea
6,kosmasp,Big Fish: How we got here,6,26 November 2016,"Despite the fact that this tanked (the joke everyone is making) at the box office, this isn't half as bad, as some may let you believe it is. It's not the best movie either of course. But it does boast a nice pre-/sequel to one of the best known stories that plays on a boat in the ocean out there.The drama and the tension is there, and the story is being told from the ""future"", so there is a certain knowledge to a possible outcome. What it isn't, is the whole story you may expect. You could call this Ahab begins or something like that. But it's still enough to be entertained, though another Heart of the ocean is not going to happen. Guess it got lost in the ocean ... Jokes aside, this does more or less what it sets out to do, if that's enough for you, enjoy",In the Heart of the Sea
7,ma-cortes,"Adventure , thrills , and sea chases , being wonderfully shot in the Canary Islands , Spain",7,15 January 2016,"Agreeable retelling , vividly played , in which a Captain called Pollard (Benjamin Walker , though other actors that were considered included Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Hiddleston, and Henry Cavill) and a tough first officer , Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth) command a surly ship of whale hunters through sheer ruthlessness and ego . Fine rendition freely based on Herman Neville novel : ¨Moby Dick¨ , with enjoyable interpretations from all-star-cast . Based on the true story of the ship Essex , a whaling ship that was attacked and sunk by a sperm whale in the southern Pacific Ocean in 1820 . In this extremely loose adaptation of Melville's classic novel, George Pollard , Ahab-alike , is revealed initially not as a bitter and revengeful madman . This oceans saga features some survivors of a lost whaling ship and relates the tale of a white whale as well as the captain Pollard's obsession with desires for vendetta upon the greatest animal . It starts in New England , where an expert officer and harpooner signs aboard the whaling ship along with rookie captain George Pollard . Both of whom meet a motley crew formed by two-fisted sailors as Caleb Chappel (Paul Anderson) , Henry Coffin (Frank Dillane) , Richard Peterson (Osy Ikhile) , Benjamin Lawrence (Joseph Mawle) , Ramsdell (Sam Keeley ) and Matthew Joy (Cillian Murphy) , among others . They are attacked by a huge Cachalot that causes destruction and wreck havoc . Pollard , subsequently , consecrates his life to hunt it , full of hating and vengeance . He has a self-destructive obsession to hunt the white whale , carrying out obstinately his revenge and determination to seek avenge on the beast that destroyed his crew and ship .Based on a true incident inspired Herman Melville's ""Moby Dick"" . Yet another take on of Melville's classic battle of wills story described on the book titled ""In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex¨ by Nathaniel Philbrick , being well written by screenwriter Charles Leavitt . The picture is a fine as well as free adaptation of the famous novel well scripted/adapted and ably realized , though full of computer generator FX . ¨In the heart of the sea¨ is an attractive tale of life on the high seas , and in particular on board a whale schooner named 'Essex' , while in the classic novel is called ¨Pequod¨ . This impressive adaptation based on Herman Melville's 1851 classic novel is vividly brought to screen . The interactions between George Pollard , Owen Chase , Matthew Joy are reminiscent of ¨Moby Dick's personages¨ as Captain Ahab , Ishmael , Starbuck , Queequeg , Daggoo , as well as the main characters of ¨Billy Budd¨, another novel written by Herman Melville , and it results to be one of the most thrilling and moving see sagas ever written . Suspense and tension of the ocean is completely captured , including enduring frames as the braving storms , famine , panic and despair , the men will call into question their deepest beliefs , from the value of their existences to the morality of their works as whale-killers . Climatic battle between the giant whale and the harpooners , it is an overwhelming piece of cinema as you are likely to watch . Charles Leavitt , Rick Jaffa , Amanda Silver wrote the story and screenplay that was partially faith to the novel . And filmmaker Ron Howard stamping this movie with epic images and thought-provoking dialogs . Enjoyable recounting , including quite a few moments that click make this top-of-the-range movie more than watchable . The FX experts created a great whale made by means of ordinary computer generator . Top-notch main and secondary cast realize extraordinary performances . Chris Hemsworth is nice as well as Benjamin Walker and Tom Holland . This marks the second collaboration between director Ron Howard and actor Chris Hemsworth , their first collaboration was Rush (2013). Phenomenal support cast , plenty of familiar faces who give perfect interpretations , such as Brendan Gleeson , Cillian Murphy , Jordi Mollà , Michelle Fairley , Paul Anderson , Frank Dillane , Joseph Mawle , Donald Sumpter , Richard Bremmer and Ben Whishaw as Herman Melville Cameraman Anthony Dod Mantle's appropriate color cinematography splendidly conveys the bleaker qualities of the chase . Exciting and thrilling musical score by Roque Baños , being filmed on location in the Canaries , where in 1956 John Huston directed the classic version starred by Gregory Peck , Richard Basehart , Harry Andrews and Orson Welles . The motion picture was compellingly directed by Ron Howard . This is the sixth film directed by Ron Howard based on a true story. The others were ""Apolo 13 (1995)"", ""A beautiful mind (2001) "", ""Cinderella Man (2005)"", ""Frost versus Nixon (2008)"" and ""Rush (2013)"". Rating : Very good , better tan average . Well worth watching .",In the Heart of the Sea
8,Coventry,"This time, the Whale is tailing YOU!",5,12 June 2021,"A film about how a writer found inspiration to complete a world-famous and best-selling classic? Sure, why not. It's not too common but not entirely unseen, neither. I remember Ken Russell's ""Gothic"" and Marc Forster's ""Finding Neverland"", and they were both reasonably interesting. And besides, the novel in question here ""Moby Dick"" and that happens to be one of the greatest stories ever penned down! Largely fictional or not, the brilliant Herman Melville novel deserves a homage. ""In the Heart of the Sea"" narrates how the young author seeks out Tom Nickerson, the last remaining survivor of the Essex; - a Massachusetts' whaling ship that sunk reputedly after being attacked by a gigantic white whale. Although reluctant at first, Nickerson eventually tells the whole story in which he was merely a supportive character. Nickerson was an inexperienced cabin boy, while the real protagonists were the heroic first mate Owen Chase and the arrogant Captain Pollard.What overcame the Essex is a captivating and compelling piece of maritime history, and director Ron Howard is a terrific storyteller, but for my personal taste the film is much too digital, and much too computer engineered. One of the reasons why ""Moby Dick"" - more than 65 years old already - ranks among my favorite movies of all times is because it features such astonishing photography and authentic location work. The storms, the shipwrecks and the whale attacks in ""In the Heart of the Sea"" look too fake, period. The sperm whale, although really big for sure, isn't the least bit menacing. The performances are quite good, notably from Cillian Murphy and the young Tom Holland.",In the Heart of the Sea
9,Theo Robertson,A Rather Rudimentary Nantucket Sleighride,6,21 December 2015,"Good idea for a film . Take a source based upon the true account of the sinking of the whaling ship Essex that inspired Hermann Melville to write MOBY DICK . The incident also inspired prog-rock band mountain to write a track on their 1971 album called Nantucket sleighride which probably won't mean anything to most people reading this but Brits of a certain age know the instrumental break from the track as being the theme tune to WEEKEND WORLD and if nothing else probably explains why I developed a keen interest in politics and current affairs from an early age . On top of that we've got an Oscar winning director filming a cast of mainly British character actors in a story of epic adventure . What can go wrong ? To be fair there's not much wrong with IN THE HEART OF THE SEA but you're left feeling that things might have been done better , especially the element of human drama . This element is touched upon but never fully developed . Owen Chase finds himself coming in to serious conflict with Captain Pollard not in a dissimilar manner Captain Bligh and Fletcher Christian might have had on the Bounty but this is never explored because the film concentrates on a whale hunt . Stabbing sea-borne mammals to death with harpoons in order to capture the oil in their bodies probably won't go down well with a 21st Century audience but one would have thought more attention might have been paid to the human characters especially if they're going to find themselves in hot water later on . Instead everything involving the crew is skated over a bit too lightly Ah that's what the film's major failing is - it's sacrificed characterisation and everything else for spectacle . There's nothing necessarily wrong with this and it's not immediately noticeable on screen but much of this is achieved via CGI and green-screen . Again let me re-emphasise that this doesn't look like an amateur CGI fest you'd see on the SyFy channel but I've just had the pleasure of watching THE REVENANT a similar story of man versus nature from the same time period and some of the scenes there had me literally gasping ""WOW"" out loud . With IN THE HEART OF THE SEA I really didn't get the same reaction probably because it's a Hollywood blockbuster that tries hard but doesn't try hard enough to be different from every other Hollywood blockbuster from the last few years",In the Heart of the Sea
10,LeonLouisRicci,Safe & PainlessLooks Like a Mud-Puddle & Just as Deep,5,5 June 2016,"Inconsistent Director Ron Howard shows His Bland and Boring side in this High-Budget Movie that Flopped just like that Enormous Tail of the Whale that Howard Fetishizes in this Grandiose Failure.The Movie Looks like what it is, a lot of CGI Phoniness with the Color Washed Out and Glazed Over with a Sepia-Toned Gloss. The Actors are Pawns that move around in the Movie with Little Gravitas and the whole thing is rendered like an Assembly Line Product made for the Masses.

11,zardoz-13,An Incredible But Seaworthy Real-Life Saga,8,21 December 2015,"Adventure yarns don't get any more audacious than ""Apollo 13"" director Ron Howard's 19th century seafaring saga of survival and tragedy ""In the Heart of the Sea,"" with Chris Hemsworth. This atmospheric adaptation of Nathaniel Philbrick's best-selling, non-fiction account chronicles the demise of the whale ship Essex in the year 1820. Basically, this nautical nightmare charts the final voyage of a Nantucket based whaling vessel that an enormous white whale sinks with extreme prejudice. Surpassed only by Jonah's escapade in the belly of a great fish, this incident occurred in the Pacific Ocean, and Herman Melville found it impressive enough to serve as the basis for his classic novel ""Moby Dick."" Not surprisingly, life is stranger than fiction, and skeptics may agree after they read the eyewitness accounts of this calamity documented in the book ""Thomas Nickerson, Owen Chase, and Others: The Loss of the Ship Essex, Sunk by a Whale."" Actors Chris Hemsworth and Benjamin Walker take top billing in this oceanic opus, but the real stars are the CGI team behind the creation of the menacing sperm whale: special robotics technician David Jonathon Amos and senior visual effects coordinator Eva Abramycheva. Of course, others too numerous to name assisted them, and the artifice is extraordinary. ""In the Heart of the Sea"" wouldn't have looked half as convincing if it had been made back when Philbrick's book came out in 2000. Mind you, it isn't just the whale itself that looks sensational in every respect, but also scenes above the water line when the Essex flounders in a squall. Specifically, the scene where a whale is harpooned by our hero and plunges headlong into the briny deep and threatens to capsize the whale boat generates white-knuckled suspense galore!Things get off to a bad start for our brawny protagonist, Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth of ""Thor""), whose wife is due to give birth to their first child. Owen has served as a first mate on a number of profitable voyages for a Nantucket whale ship company. Chase believes he is going to be promoted to the rank of captain of the refitted whale ship Essex. The owners regret to inform him that he has been superseded by another man, George Pollard (Benjamin Walker of ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter""), whose father is a patron of the line. Pollard takes the helm of the Essex because he possesses the right family connections. Meantime, a seasoned professional as first mate, Chase amounts to the better man, but he lacks Pollard's ancestry. Initially, the two clash over how to navigate the Essex through in a nasty squall that challenges the crew and nearly swamps the vessel. Things grow worse because they are unable to catch enough whales. Three months later, Pollard decides to leave the Atlantic. Taking the Essex aground the tip of South America, they venture into the Pacific. In Ecuador, where they put in to stock up on supplies, Pollard and Owen share drinks with a one-armed Spanish whaling captain (Jordi Mollà of ""Colombiana"") in a bar. The Spaniard confides in them about a plentiful whale playground. Nevertheless, he warns them about an aggressive ""white-as-alabaster"" sperm whale that killed six of his sailors. Our heroes treat the Spaniard's tall tale with considerable skepticism. No sooner have they launched their boats to harpoon the whales than disaster strikes. A whale capsizes Chase's long boat, and he must return to the Essex to plug the holes. While Chase is back on board repairing the long boat, something smashes savagely into the hull. Incredibly, the Essex commences to sink. A sailor reports that their pumps are kaput, and our heroes barely manage to evacuate the vessel before flames consume it in an inferno. They row to a desert island and recuperate until Chase discovers a cave filled with the corpses of marooned mariners. Since they have sighted no ships, Pollard and Chase decide to take their chances with the sea. Again, no sooner have they entered the water than the whale reappears and stalks them. The confrontation that Pollard and his men face against this ""Jaws"" like whale is pretty exciting stuff. Eventually, Pollard and Chase return to Nantucket. The whaling company tries to whitewash the debacle, but they try to convince both Pollard and Chase to attribute their tragedy to the Essex running around. Chase is reunited with his wife some two years later, and he meets his daughter. Meantime, Pollard struggles without success to hunt down the white whale and his career as a captain flounders as a result.Unfortunately, Howard and ""Blood Diamond"" scenarist Charles Leavitt have taken liberties with Philbrick's source material. The most significant setback of this otherwise singular story is the manner in which they have approached it. Everything about the ill-fated voyage is told in flashback as the grown-up survivor of the Essex, Thomas Nickerson (Brendan Gleeson of ""Beowulf"") recounts with extreme reluctance the catastrophe to author Herman Melville. Presumably, Howard and Leavitt felt that the history of the incident was far too outlandish to present in straightforward fashion without their tedious interludes. Had this narrative device simply been book ends during fade-in and then at fade-out, ""In the Heart of the Sea"" would have fared better. Obviously, suspense of any sort involving the member of the crew that Brendan Gleeson portrayed is jettisoned. The second problem is the drama that occurs between Benjamin Walker's captain and Chris Hemsworth's first-mate. Actually, unlike the film that claims they have never served together before, the two had been together on an earlier voyage. Furthermore, the captain was older than the first-mate. The dispute over who was named captain simply turns out to be a Hollywood contrivance to generate more antagonism between them. Happily, some of this is offset by the novelty of the historical setting. At the time of the event, whale oil provided the only means of illumination. Despite its problems, ""In the Heart of the Sea"" still qualifies as a whale of a tale.",In the Heart of the Sea
12,grantss,Good nautical adventure,7,17 October 2016,"A dramatisation of the true events that inspired Herman Melville's classic novel ""Moby Dick"". In 1820 the whaling ship Essex sets sail from Nantucket, Massachusetts. After a largely fruitless search in the Atlantic she heads for the west coast of South America. There she hears about rich whaling grounds several hundred miles west. After reaching the whaling grounds she is attacked and sunk by massive white sperm whale. The crew take to the boats in what will be an epic struggle for survival.A good story, well told by director Ron Howard. Good, tense survival and action scenes. The saga feels very realistic. Decent special effects.The fact that it is (mostly) true adds spice and the fact that this was the inspiration for Moby Dick is another bonus.Solid performance by Chris Hemsworth in the lead role, doing what he does best - being the hero.

Ron Howard's epic take on an American classic - based on true events for the novel of 'MOBY DICK', the tale of a whaling expedition's close encounter with the alabaster leviathan and its aftermath - is told with grand filmmaking yet cumbersome storytelling in attempting to tell several tales at once: truth is stranger than fiction; greed is the root of all evil; man vs. nature et.al. However the incredible special effects and widescreen panorama dictates the action at hand with a fine cast led by stolid Hemsworth as a stoic first mate leading by experience and at logger heads with its nascent captain (Walker).

15,neil-476,"Good, but could have been better",7,8 January 2016,"Herman Melville, in the course of preparing to write Moby Dick, prevails upon Tom Nickerson to tell him the story of the ill-fated whaling ship The Essex, a story which Nickerson has kept secret, to his own torment, for many, many years. The story involves a huge white whale which destroyed the Essex, but should Melville also write about the story of survival which followed? Ron Howard directs a big film which takes the interesting approach of telling almost-Moby Dick within the context of a framing story about how Moby Dick came to be written. Let me say that the performances are excellent, the story is well-told (I would expect nothing else from Ron Howard), and the special effects are, for the most part, astonishingly effective.Let me then go on to say that the one area where the effects don't quite work is in how the humans are lit in the whaling boats – they don't quite match the backgrounds, they don't quite feel outdoors. And there are a lot of sequences with the men in whaling boats. And let me then go on to say that the terrible secret – held out in front of the audience since old Tom initially rejects Melville's approach in the first 5 minutes – is pretty predictable, and is part of a survival sequence which outstays its welcome. The film is just over 2 hours long, but it feels longer. At 90 minutes it would have been sharper and more gripping.It is a good film, but it could have been better.",In the Heart of the Sea
16,morrison-dylan-fan,Song of the Sea.,7,22 June 2017,"After watching the marvellous 1976 film Bartleby,I started looking for other Herman Melville-related projects. Trying to sail in a different direction to the famous productions of Moby Dick,I was intrigued to find a flick about the inspiration behind Melville's book,which led to me meeting the real Captain Ahab.The plot-1850:Wanting to build on the outline for his next set-at sea novel, author Herman Melville tracks down Thomas Nickerson,a former cabin boy who is the only living survivor of the sinking of the Essex. Pushed with money by Melville,Nickerson begins telling his tale.1820:Cashing in on the whale oil gold rush, whaling company includes some quick additions to the Essex so it can go whale hunting. Hiring Nickerson as a cabin boy,the company get Owen Chase as First Mate and George Pollard as Captain. Going deep into the Offshore Grounds,the crew try to catch a white whale,but fail to,and are left with a broken ship. Stranded in the middle of the sea,the crew enter the heart of darkness of the ocean.View on the film:Racing down from the race tracks of Rush with the same lead actor and cameraman,director Ron Howard & cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle ride the wave of ""Golden Age"" Hollywood epics, where sweeping crane shots over the beautiful Canary Islands and very well done earthy CGI make the ocean go as far across the screen as the eye can see.Harpooning the crew into the depths of the sea,Howard washes the bright blockbuster blue away for over saturated burning yellows and blood reds dehydrating any memory of adventure from the crew.Altering the fascinating real story behind Nickerson's autobiography (he wrote it in 1876,and it remained lost until 1960!) the screenplay by Charles Leavitt/ Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver brings to shore the friction Chase and Pollard over who should be the captain,whilst the crew keep their eyes on the task at hand. Carving out the boys own Adventure into incredibly dark themes that include suicide,the writers give the months lost at sea a real weight,where the dialogue,and the life drain out of the survivors.Reuniting with Howard, Chris Hemsworth gives Chase a salty gravitas,which Hemsworth uses as a uniting glue among the others. Following orders from Benjamin Walker's slick Pollard, Tom Holland wonderfully grinds down the wide-eyed innocence of young Nickerson,as he enters the belly of the beast.",In the Heart of the Sea
17,phd_travel,"Very well filmed, the true story is more interesting than fiction",10,3 December 2015,"This stunningly filmed movie is about the true story that was the inspiration for Moby Dick. The movie is worth watching because it's so well filmed, the ocean cinematography is just breathtaking - it's almost enough to make you slightly sea sick. It's actually a better, more interesting and more horrific story than Moby Dick. The characters were imperfect heroes who made mistakes that led to the events.The actors are well cast and their faces fit well into the time period. Chris Hemsworth looks very much like a 19th Century sea man if a bit larger than life as the first mate. Benjamin Walker has a face that looks very much like a 19th Century portrait of a New England man.Last year Angelina Jolie's stranded at sea survival story ""Unbreakable"" gave us a taste of the thirst and horror of being without water. But this movie shows us more than thirst with cannibalism.If like me you thought Moby Dick was boring, this movie is actually much more interesting.

18,gradyharp,'The devil loves unspoken secrets. Especially those that fester in a man's soul.',10,30 July 2016,"Ron Howard applies his usual magic touch to this epic of a film – based on Nathaniel Philbrick's book IN THE HEART OF THE SEA as adapted for the screen by Charles Leavitt with Rick Jaffe and Amanda Silver. It is one of the most magnificent visual films of recent times – cinematography directed by Anthony Dod Mantle with special underwater photographers assisting. All members of the production crew deserve plaudits for accomplishing this feat of cinematic brilliance – and a sterling cast of actors of course abets them.

The man refuses to speak but his wife (Michelle Fairley) insists otherwise, believing that Thomas has been tormenting himself by refusing to speak of his story, so he starts. Nantucket farmer and whaler Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth) convinces his wife (Charlotte Riley) all will be better as he gets his promised captaincy. But the executives have him as the first mate instead on his next whaling journey aboard the Essex, accommodating young Captain George Pollard (Benjamin Walker), who is descended from a family of prestigious whalers. After they set out, Owen shows he's the de facto captain with his skills and initiative. One day the captain orders the crew to head into a squall despite Owen's warning. As the ship gets damaged the captain orders to turn around, but the waves wreak havoc to the ship. This starts open animosity between George and Owen, but they grudgingly remain allies for the sake of the ship's success. Young Nickerson (Tom Holland) gets his first experience with whale oil when he is ordered to slip inside the head to scoop leftover oil. But no whale appears for the Essex for the next several months. After sailing far they meet a Spanish captain (Jordi Mollà) informing of them a large whale pack's location, but there's also a 'demon' whale. Both George and Owen agree to chase the pack, dismissing the 'demon' whale as a myth. They reach the place and soon find the 'demon', a 30-foot long white whale. It easily damages the Essex' hull, forcing the crew to abandon her. The whale oil the crew had gathered earlier catches fire, but the crew are able to save the three harpoon boats and some makeshift sails. The crew rations their supplies, but the supplies are very limited. After days adrift, Owen spots the demon whale following them. The second mate Matthew Joy (Cillian Murphy) gets injured in a storm. Again Owen spots the demon whale; this time, it attacks the boats, killing some men. They get washed ashore to an island. But after some time, Owen finds a cave full of decomposing bodies and realizes that other crews that were stranded here waited in vain for someone to rescue them. Owen proposes to leave since no boats will come.And so it goes until the end when some – including Owen – make it home but only after surviving months of adversity. The film closes with old Nickerson facing his demons, Melville getting his story, and the new concept of getting oil from the ground rather from whales at sea foretells the future. A brilliant work of cinema on all accounts.",In the Heart of the Sea
19,deloudelouvain,I secretly hoped they all would die in a horrible way,7,7 April 2016,"The movie itself is not bad and I mean by that the filming and the actors. And that's why I give it a seven for ratings. But to me personally, being a vegetarian, I didn't like the whole killing whales thing. Even if it is fictional. I actually secretly hoped the whale would massacre them all and that they would all die in as much pain as possible. I seriously doubt that this story was the inspiration for Herman Melville's Moby-Dick. Whales are not aggressive at all, big and impressive, yes, but aggressive, no way. But nevertheless if you're looking to have a couple of hours of entertainment then In The Heart Of The Sea is a good option.",In the Heart of the Sea
20,siderite,Not what I expected. In a good way.,8,30 September 2020,"I barely glanced at the marketing for this film and my mind was already made up: ""Oh, no! Not another Moby Dick film. I've seen some. I may have even read the book (not really) and I can't remember. Do something bloody original for once, Hollywood!"". But the movie is not about Moby Dick, but about the real story of the sinking of the Essex which famously inspired Herman Melville in writing the dicky book. And this means you get more realism, no over dramatization - well, not in the sense of the original book, but also a slightly less satisfying ending.The actors did a good job, the sea visuals are great and, considering the rather lackluster source material by Nathaniel Philbrick, better than average. Yet it lacked something. I didn't feel the majesty of the sea or felt any kinship with either character, be them human or whale. It was a dramatic story of seamen stranded in the middle of the sea. No morals, no greater message. Also no image of heroic people overcoming adversity. And keep in mind that this film had in it Spiderman, Thor and Benjen Stark!Bottom line: a nice ocean period movie, but not inspiring in any way.",In the Heart of the Sea
21,JamesHitchcock,The Whale Strikes Back,8,13 January 2016,"In the early nineteenth century, before the development of the petroleum industry, whaling was big business as whale oil was in great demand for lamps. The centre of this lucrative trade was the small island of Nantucket off the coast of New England. By the 1810s over-hunting meant that whales were now in short supply in the Atlantic and whalers were forced to travel further and further afield into the Pacific in pursuit of their quarry. And then in 1820 the whales struck back. The Nantucket whaling ship Essex was rammed and sunk by a sperm whale in the South Pacific. The survivors were forced to abandon ship and climb into three intact whaling boats in which they hoped to navigate the 2,000 miles separating them from the South American mainland. The film is based on Nathaniel Philbrick's best-selling non-fiction account of these events, but pares them down to the bare essentials, omitting much of Philbrick's extra detail. (For example, the book tells us that the survivors considered making for Tahiti rather than South America, but rejected this option because they wrongly believed South Sea Islanders to be murderous cannibals. The film omits this detail). The film uses a framework technique; in 1850 Thomas Nickerson, the last survivor of the Essex, tells his story to the author Herman Melville who is seeking material for his new novel. (This book, of course, was to be ""Moby-Dick"", which was indeed inspired by the last voyage of the Essex). Ron Howard has made films about many different subjects- among others advanced mathematics, journalism, the Old West, space travel, boxing, politics, motor racing and now whaling- but two frequent themes in his more serious movies as opposed to his comedies are a man, or a small group of men, struggling to overcome difficult odds, and two men whose contrasting personalities bring them into conflict. Both these themes are present here. A keynote in the early part of the film is the rivalry between the ship's captain George Pollard and his first mate Owen Chase. Chase is the more experienced seaman of the two but has been denied promotion to captain because he is not from a nautical family. (His father was a farmer on the mainland). Pollard, by contrast, is the scion of a long- established Nantucket whaling dynasty. The relationship between the disciplinarian Pollard and the more popular and easy-going Chase resembles that between Captain Bligh and Fletcher Christian in the various screen versions of ""Mutiny on the Bounty"", although, unlike Bligh, Pollard never alienates his crew to the point where they are prepared to mutiny against him. Later, however, and especially after the sinking, the two men realise that they need to put their differences aside.Both roles are well played, the rather aloof Pollard by Benjamin Walker (an actor I had not previously come across) and the more approachable Chase by Chris Hemsworth. Brendan Gleeson (aged 60 and here looking older) is, strictly speaking, miscast as the older Nickerson who was only a 14-year-old cabin boy in 1820 and therefore would only have been 44 in 1850. I will not, however, cavil on this point as Gleeson is in fact very good. Nickerson is obviously dealing with matters that are deeply painful memories, and yet, after some initial reluctance, we sense that he is compelled to tell Melville his story in order to achieve catharsis from some inner torment. As he approaches the climax of his tale, we realise just why these memories are so painful for him. ""In the Heart of the Sea"", therefore is more than a mere seafaring yarn; it is a character-driven psychological drama as well. The pure ""adventure"" elements in the story, however, are dealt with very well, and a lot of tension and excitement is generated by the action scenes including the storm at sea and, above all, the heart-stopping sequence in which the whale attacks the ship. I have found that, in recent years at least, Howard has generally been at his best when dealing with subjects based upon real-life events. I enjoyed, for example, the likes of ""Apollo 13"", ""A Beautiful Mind"" and ""Rush"" more than I did ""Willow"", ""The Paper"", ""The Missing"" or ""The Da Vinci Code"". An exception to this rule has always been the obviously fictional fantasy ""Splash"" from the very early part of his which until now has always been my favourite Howard film. ""In the Heart of the Sea"" may now have claimed that title. 8/10",In the Heart of the Sea
22,StevePulaski,A film as cold and unsubtle as the ocean itself,4,12 December 2015,"Watching a two hour film showing a static shot Herman Melville slaving over a typewriter, mumbling under his breath, and sweating profusely while writing ""Moby Dick"" would be more interesting and insightful than Ron Howard's ""In the Heart of the Sea,"" a film about the story that inspired the classic novel. The film revolves around Herman Melville (played by Ben Whishaw) obtaining the story from Thomas Nickerson (Brendan Gleeson in his later years), who survived a shipwreck in 1820 that left him and his crew stranded on a life-boat in the middle of the ocean for three months, more than a thousand miles from land. The story recounts the ship known as ""Essex,"" captained by George Pollard, Jr. (Benjamin Walker) and Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth). Also on board is the boat's second officer, Matthew Joy (Cillian Murphy), and a young Nickerson, who serves as the ship's cabin boy.Upon the ship wrecking and subsequently ripping in half by an enormous bull sperm whale, the four men take refuge on a small life boat with dwindling food supply. They realize that if they can somehow attack and kill the whale with the equipment they have, they can put themselves out of harm's way and perhaps have a sustainable food source. The idea is so outlandish that it just might work.When I first heard about ""In the Heart of the Sea,"" I immediately grew excited. Knowing that most of the film would take place on the seas, I automatically assume human interest and character development would take prominence over everything else, and even hoped for Charles Leavitt's script to hit some survivalist notes. The problem with ""In the Heart of the Sea"" is its emphasis on cinematic polish, resorting to dialog that feels and sounds heavily scripted and situations that feel directly stripped out of a screen writing book about concocting a problematic, but more elegant and story-based, disaster film. Rather than focusing on a minimalist premise and making a film in the vein of ""All is Lost,"" ""Life of Pi,"" or ""Open Water,"" ""In the Heart of the Sea"" resorts to lingering on cold, robotic characters, an unsubtle score that emphasizes how you should feel and when you should feel that way, and a narrative that lacks any compelling human interest.While recognizable faces like Chris Hemsworth, Brendan Gleeson, and Benjamin Walker may prolifically grace the screen, they may as well be up-and-coming actors with how little personality Howard and Leavitt have given them. Everybody here doesn't feel invested in the screenplay, nor too motivated or entranced by the story and legacy of ""Moby Dick."" This isn't necessarily the actors' fault because there's nothing to really grab on to in terms of their character nor their motivations. Everybody speaks with that stunning coldness that dehumanizes people in films and leaves them as nothing more than empty vessels that spew dialog when required. Not a single line of dialog in this film resonates, and when you have four characters stranded at sea and made even more helpless by the presence of a dangerous behemoth of a whale, nearly every word should have some sort of resonation or, at the very least, carry some weight.But ""In the Heart of the Sea"" never really finds itself focusing on the story's vast setting of the ocean, due to the fact we have to keep cutting back to Melville talking to Nickerson in his old age. The constant desire and impulse to change settings in order to break free from one core setting is the biggest screen writing flaw with films that should be confined to a sole setting. We have the potential to feel as trapped and as wayward as the characters, but by constantly backpedaling or flashing-forward, there is no locational connection. Throw in a score that needs to capitalize on every emotional occurrence in the film to make the audience realize that what we're witnessing should effect us in some manner, and you have a film with desperately little confidence in its audience.""In the Heart of the Sea"" was originally going to be released in March of 2015, but was pushed back until December, yet had release date conflicts with ""Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens"" and was pushed up a week in advance (because, you know, that one week advantage over ""Star Wars"" will guarantee that everyone who wants to see this film will see it and then not totally forget about it the next week in favor of the biggest film of the decade). A lot of effort to try and obtain Oscar nominations that this film likely won't get and doesn't deserve.",In the Heart of the Sea
23,sddavis63,"A Good, Sea-Faring Yarn",8,10 February 2018,"First of all, yes. it is a yarn. Oh yes. There really was an Essex, and it really was attacked by a whale, and the crew really did struggle for survival as they drifted, and the story of the Essex really was the inspiration for Herman Melville's novel ""Moby Dick."" All that is true enough. But the story told here takes a lot of liberties with what really happened to the Essex. Most importantly, the survivors of the Essex weren't stalked by one particular whale, as the movie suggests (although they were apparently later attacked by an orca.) But that aside (and I'm never too hard on movies ""based on a true story"" straying from the true story) ""In The Heart Of The Sea"" is an exciting, sea-faring adventure..Directed by Ron Howard, and starring Chris Hemwsorth as First Officer Chase and Benjamin Walker as Captain Pollard, this is really a movie that's more about human survival in desperate times. The movie is sympathetic to Chase and portrays Pollard as young and arrogant and the friction between the two is a significant part of the story. The truth is actually that it was Chase who made several mistakes that probably cost lives. But while the portrayal of that relationship may have been what drove this movie forward, basically, this is a movie about morality and how far we'll go to overcome the odds. In those ways, the movie is a good reflection on the plight of the Essex. For those who are expecting a sort of ""Jaws""-like adventure, where the whale is really the star of the show, this will be disappointing. Really, the actual attack by the whale (while very well depicted) doesn't take up all that much time in the movie. It's more the story of the crew and how they respond once the Essex sinks and they're left on the small whaling boats with little food or water and thousands of miles from the coast of South America. How far will they go to survive? It's presented as the reminiscences of Tom Nickerson (Brendan Gleeson) - a 14 year old member of the crew who reluctantly relates the story many years later to Herman Melville (Ben Whishaw), who supposedly uses Nickerson's memories as the basis for ""Moby Dick."" Whether Melville actually spoke to Nickerson I'm not sure, but I have read that before writing ""Moby Dick"" he did meet Chase's son, and after publishing ""Moby Dick"" he did meet Captain Pollard.Although most of the story is set on the Essex or its surviving whaleboats, I'd give credit to Gleeson for a very good performance. He captures the torment of Nickerson, who remains haunted 30 years later by his memories of what happened on that voyage on the Essex. In fact, I'd say generally that all the performances in this were good, and that Howard did a good job with directing.I wouldn't say that ""In The Heart Of The Sea"" (which was actually based on a book by Nathaniel Philbrick) rises to the level of a great movie, but it's certainly a movie that holds the attention of the viewer.

24,Hellmant,"Chris Hemsworth has no Box-Office draw, apparently",7,15 December 2015,"'IN THE HEART OF THE SEA': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Director Ron Howard's $100 million Box-Office bomb; based on the true adventures of a whaling ship, which was sunk by a giant white whale in 1820. The events inspired the classic 1851 novel 'Moby- Dick'. The film was written by Charles Levant, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver; and it's based on the 2000 book, of the same name, by Nathaniel Philbrick. It stars Chris Hemsworth (who last teamed with Howard, on the 2013 racing film 'RUSH'), Benjamin Walker (who's best known for playing another historical figure, Abraham Lincoln, in 'ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER'), Tom Holland (the next Spider- Man), Cillian Murphy, Ben Whishaw and Brendan Gleeson (Whishaw and Gleeson last appeared together, in the film 'SUFFRAGETTE'). The movie is a little too slow-paced, and lacking big thrills, but it is still somewhat amusing, and well made.The story takes place (primarily) aboard an 1820 New England whaling ship, called Essex. A veteran whaler, named Owen Chase (Hemsworth), is hired as it's first officer; despite the fact that he thinks he should be captain. A wealthy, but inexperienced, mariner, named George Pollard, Jr. (Walker), is assigned as the ship's captain. At first the two don't get along; but they soon learn respect, for each other's mutual passion in catching whales. When their ship is attacked, and sunken, by a giant white whale; both men are forced to do the unthinkable, in order to stay alive. The film is told from the point of view of a cabin boy (Holland), 30-years later (Gleeson).The movie has a great classic cinema feel to it; it might be a little boring (at times), but it always looks great. Hemsworth is an outstanding leading man (even though he has practically no Box- Office draw, apparently), and Walker is good in the film too. Howard has always been a decent director, as well, but he tends to be really hit-and-miss. 'RUSH' was a much better film, than this, but it's still a movie that's worth seeing (I'd say).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/dWmLQGusjEk",In the Heart of the Sea

26,ThomasDrufke,Solid,7,11 December 2015,"Let's face it. People love survival stories. Every year around this time it seems we get a bevy of films centered around people overcoming insurmountable odds whether it be at sea, war, space, or anywhere man should not normally be. In the Heart of the Sea is a solid entry in the long list of survival stories even if it doesn't live up to the intense and harrowing story the film is based on.If it wasn't already clear through the various Marvel films, Chris Hemsworth is a movie star. His on and off screen charisma is on par with that of Tom Hanks, who also starred in his own stranded-at-sea- film, Cast Away. Hemsworth's performance as Owen Chase is very good, but it doesn't stand out as much as it could. The common complaint has been that 'we're only rooting for him because he's Thor.' While I believe that's invalid for the most part because it's one of Hemsworth's better performances, there's some truth to the unlikable characters this film has. I think because we as a society are so far gone from the times when whale hunting was an actual thing people did, it's hard for us to imagine rooting for the humans to kill off this beast. With that being said, the character you definitely root for is Thomas. Played by both Brendan Gleeson and Tom Holland, he's the character we gravitate toward because he's the one stuck in the middle of all this. Young and inexperienced, Thomas looks to Mr. Chase for leadership for most of the film, which is where the heart of the film really lies, no pun intended. Sadly, all of the whale action pales in comparison to the scenes with Gleeson recounting his days at sea to Herman Melville, played by Ben Whishaw. I think part of the reason the film is getting so so reviews is that it was supposed to come out almost a year ago, and they pushed it to now so that it could potentially get some Oscar love. So just by that notion, we had higher expectations. I went in with lowered expectations and came out feeling good about the film. It has a lot of heart, especially with Hemsworth, Holland, and Gleeson. The problem is the special effects actually aren't all that great for having so much extra time. 1800's Massachusetts is well realized, but some at sea action sometimes can look cartoonish. Part of me even thought Assassins Creed Black Flag looked better in a few areas.There's certainly some redeemable qualities with the film. Great performances, a great score, and plenty of emotional moments all lead In the Heart of the Sea to be a solid film. But a so so script and a let down in special effects leans the film to be more of a disappointment than it probably deserves.+Score+Performances+Emotional pay off for the most part-Special effects-Script is uneven7.6/10",In the Heart of the Sea

31,ironhorse_iv,"This whale of tale movie was alright, but somewhat disappointing. It could had been better.",7,16 December 2015,"Whale! Whale! Whale! You would think the inspiration for author Herman Melville's 1851's novel, ""Moby Dick"" would be amazing to watch. Sadly, this 2015 biographical survivor film directed by Ron Howard, wasn't a big splash with the audiences when it came out. For me, personally, this movie was entertaining to a point; but the story about an angry sperm whale sinking a whaling boat really needed to be told, better. I really didn't like the framing device in which, this movie is told. Yes, it was mostly alright, that the movie had the whale return, multiplies times after the sinking to show, how malevolently, the creature can be, but this isn't 1975's Jaws or even 1956's Moby Dick, which were fictional movie based on true stories. This movie was market as the true-encounter that inspired the myth of Moby Dick. You can't do really do that, if you're trying to be truthful, because it totally undermined and contradict the whole marketing message. For a film saying, it's the realistic account of that story, it has to portray the whale, more to what it truly is. A normal creature that only attack once, not a symbol of God's wrath. This film wasn't even close to being accuracy to the real-life events of the sinking of the whaling ship, Essex in 1820 at all. I'm surprise, by this, because it's based on Nathaniel Philbrick's 2000 non-fiction book of the same name; which in my opinion was very accuracy. Several aspects of the story was indeed missing like the burning of Charles Island & the resupply in Galapagos in this film. Plus, it didn't help that the film depart significantly, just to add a sub-plot where author Herman Melville (Ben Whishaw) goes to an old mariner, Thomas Nickerson (Brendan Gleeson) to get his account of the events, despite being aware of the story from whaler, Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth). It really seem, pretty odd that Thomas Nickerson would know, a lot about Owen's relationship with his wife, and his boss, George Pollard (Benjamin Walker). It was a bit jarring. The film's biggest problem over the entire film was the pacing. It really took forever to get anywhere. A lot of the scenes were really drawn out & quite boring. Whenever, something interesting comes into play, the film sucks it out, by eventually abandoning the conflict; such was the case between how the ship should be run between Chase and Pollard, or the will to survive between Chase and the White Whale. It feels very anti-climax. The dialogue was also a problem. It was mostly dull exposition, with little to no character development in it. I really, didn't get to relate to anybody in the crew, as much, as I should had. I really thought, there would be great scenes that would give us, some insight on who these men, are. The movie could also work better, with some inherent adventurous epic maritime life music to it, even if it's a tragic showing. It would really lighten this movie, up. It would make the film, a lot more fun to watch. I love the use of CGI in this film. The whole whale attack really did stand out for the brief scenes, they had. It look really real to me. I also like how the film goes all bloody and grizzly in its portrayal of how ugly, the whaling business can be. Scenes like a young man being forced into a dead whale's head was pretty interesting in its gory worst. However, it was a bit weird for the PG-13 film to show that, but unable to show any scene of cannibalism during the surviving in the ocean parts. It seem like it was a bit sugar-coated. What the hell, movie! However, I do like the make-up work in this film. Some of the actors really did, looking like they were starving to death. That 500-600 calories diet that the actors had to do, was crazy. Acting wise, the film was also pretty good. Chris Hemsworth was the obvious standout, he was able to show off his acting talents quite a few times throughout the film, but still it was nothing truly astounding. It's sad that he can't show, much of his acting chops, beside those Marvel films. The supporting cast was also mostly pretty strong, with Benjamin Walker, Tom Holland, and Cillian Murphy standing out. Overall: How does In the Heart of the Sea compare to other tales of sea-voyage catastrophes? It was somewhat below average. While, braving storms, starvation, panic and despair, will call into question the man's deepest beliefs, from the value of their lives to the morality of their trade, I never really got to interested in the story to care if they live or not. While, this adaptation clearly had the big budget, it fails to connect emotionally with me, like similar films like 2000's Perfect Storm or 2012's Life of Pi. It's worth watching, but not much, replay value. See it, if you want to.",In the Heart of the Sea
32,clanciai,"""The courage to do what you don't want to do""",10,16 April 2021,"This could very well be Ron Howard's best film, although he made a number of very significant oines, starting from ""Willow"" 1988, which was epoch-making. This is wholly based on fact, on the true story that inspired Herman Melville to write ""Moby Dick"", and it appears rather clearly, why Melville chose to tell a different story than the truth, since the true story of the loss of the ""Essex"" in 1820 was a much more gruesome epic than ""Moby Dick"", which appears almost as a euphemised romanticisation in comparison. Above all, this film is excellently well made, although filmed in England and by the Canary Islands, it is totally realistic, every detail is important and adds to the realism, and the protagonists couldn't be more convincing, although very far from the almost Shakespearian version by Melville. Also visually this film is an astounding masterpiece, and already the storm in the beginning is as impressing as the reality of it would have been, and that realistic grip is sustained throughout the film. You will be surprised to find that the ship is sunk by the whale only half through the film, in ""Moby Dick"" it's the grand finale, and you will wonder what the last hour will be filled up with. You will not be disappointed in spite of the ordeals.The music is also excellent, and it's worth while to stay on and wait for the last chords to fade out with the final acknowledgements of the full cast and crew, because there will be even a signing female voice to finalise the satisfaction.

So the people comparing it with 'Moby Dick', because both the film is about the same story, but one was inspired and the other one was, I mean this film was based on the actual event. I had seen the BBC film 'The Whale', not a bad film for a low budget television film. Most importantly, it revealed the truth about what I was not aware of from one of my favourite sea adventure films.I never read the book, but saw the British version, so I knew what I'm going to witness. Still, I was very interested to check it out, because it is a grand film and as expected I loved the visuals. Those sea adventures were very realistic, except the action sequences which is obviously cinema gimmick. The surprise part was the narration. It was a flashback story, something like 'Life of Pi', a man recall his old memory of his survival at the sea with other crew members of the ship Essex when it was attacked by a big white whale.It is kind of impossible to believe what this film says is true. And obviously what we see is not what exactly happened, but very close. So see this film to believe it. Whatever it is, I totally enjoyed watching it. The 2 hour long never looked too long.

35,tomgillespie2002,Obvious CGI makes it impossible to truly engage with the action,5,6 May 2016,"When taking into account the reputation of Herman Melville's novel Moby Dick as one of the Great American Novels, it is surprising that so few directors have taken it upon themselves to adapt the epic tale of man against nature. The most famous and well-respected is John Huston's 1956 effort that starred Gregory Peck as the obsessed Captain Ahab and, dismissing the few straight-to-DVD efforts and TV movies over the past few years, it is really the only one of note. Ron Howard has also decided to side-step Melville's tricky beast in favour of the true story that inspired it, the sinking of the whaling ship Essex.Almost as if Howard was afraid that the sight of a group of battered, starving sailors drifting would be too boring for the audience to stomach for two hours, the story begins with Melville himself (played by Ben Whishaw) paying a visit to the only remaining survivor of the Essex's doomed voyage, Thomas Nickerson (Brendan Gleeson). After a bit of nagging from his wife (Michelle Fairley) and the promise of whiskey, Nickerson soon begins spilling the tale he has kept bottled up for years, and reveals that it is not just a story of a giant, extremely peeved-off whale, but that of two men - first mate Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth) and captain George Pollard (Benjamin Walker).The men sitting behind the desks at the Nantucket whaling company view Chase, despite his impressive record at collecting whale oil, as a 'landsman' - someone born outside of the vast whaling family. Pollard is inexperienced and envious of Chase's reputation and popularity, and there personalities soon clash. Most is viewed through the eyes of the young Nickerson (played by Tom Holland, the new Spider-Man), and just when the two potential father figures reach a mutual understanding and finally discover whales after months at sea, they are rammed by a giant sperm whale and left hundreds of miles from shore with limited food, water and supplies.You would think that a story so packed with sea-faring adventure and the promise of an unknown monster lurking beneath the surface would be effortlessly thrilling, but sadly In the Heart of the Sea is not. While certainly an overrated director, Ron Howard has made exciting films before, but here the action is so laced with obvious CGI that it makes it impossible to truly engage with the action. The film actually works best during its quieter moments. While peppered with survival-movie clichés and sluggish character development, its well- performed by the (mostly British) cast, particularly Walker, whose character arc pleasantly surprised me, and Holland, who is surely destined to be a star in the future. Still, we wait patiently for the film that does Meville, or the story behind his greatest work, justice.",In the Heart of the Sea
36,Thanos_Alfie,The start of Moby-Dick...,6,28 March 2020,"""In the Heart of the Sea"" is an Action - Biography movie in which we watch a group of sailors in 1820 trying to capture a giant whale for its oil but their ship is complete destroyed by it and now they have to survive. This experience was the starting point of the great novel Moby-Dick.I enjoyed this movie because it was very interesting and had many good action scenes. In addition to this, the direction which was made by Ron Howard was exceptional and I liked the way he presented the struggle of the sailors and also the evolution of some of the characters of the movie. Regarding the interpretations, I have to mention Chris Hemsworth's who played as Owen Chase, Benjamin Walker's who played as George Pollard and Tom Holland's who played as Thomas Nickerson and they were all simply amazing. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Brendan Gleeson's who played as Tom Nickerson and Cillian Murphy's who played as Matthew Joy and they both gave a different touch in the movie. I highly recommend everyone to watch this movie because I am sure that you will enjoy it and you won't be bored at all. It's a nice afternoon movie to spend your time with.",In the Heart of the Sea
37,eddie_baggins,Howards visually strong film sails between the waters of greatness and mediocrity,7,3 December 2015,"Let's deal with the elephant in the room or in this particular case the great white whale in the boat, old ginger top Ron Howard's impressive looking new high seas adventure is not one of the year's best (or awards player as many thought) but it's an often mightily enjoyable time out at the cinema thanks to its visual spectacle. Delayed from an early year release at years start and set a new opening timeslot in the awards friendly period of December, hype started building for this adaptation of Nathaniel Philbrick's well-loved novel (or simply the ""real Moby Dick"" story) that had many calling out the film as both a likely box office hot shot and a real wild card at this year's awards circuits. What singular element likely to hold In the Heart of the Sea back from such bounties is hard to pinpoint but a summation could be given to suggest a lack of heart and strangely plotted narrative are key factors to Heart's inability to truly set sail. Those who expected Heart to be a real man v whale high stakes thrill ride will be sorely disappointed as that's really not Howard's focus here while others may find themselves growing weary quickly of Heart's more survival against the odds scenario that sadly features characters we'd love to care a little more about. From all reports investing in the characters in Philbrick's book is not an issue but with Chris Hemsworth's Owen Chase here leading the charge as second mate of the Essex and its captain George Pollard (played to boorish effect by Benjamin Walker) the crew of this wailing vessel fail to engage us on their high stakes journey and as ""big white"" makes his debut and the crew start to be whittled down in number, a realisation dawns that Howard and his screenwriter Charles Leavitt haven't done enough for us to invest our emotions in their increasingly doomed plight against one huge freak of nature. After so-so turns in Snow White and the Huntsman and the beyond awful Blackhat, questions must now be raised about Hemsworth's ability to lead a film outside of his Thor comfort zone and whilst his not terrible here he's certainly not the one to help lead Heart forward to another level and in his struggles with nailing accents is again prevalent here although that's never stopped fellow Australian ex-pat Russell Crowe. Side players like Cillian Murphy's Matthew Joy and Brendan Gleeson's aged Thomas Nickerson end up making more of an impression but as like most of the ensemble they are underused and slightly underdeveloped.This real life Moby Dick is directed with enough assurance and visual flair by the professional and proficient Ron Howard that throughout its two hour run time there's enough to warrant a cinema screen viewing but you can't help escape the feeling that in the end we were never hooked the way we should be to this almost unbelievably huge adventure. In the Heart of the Sea assuredly sails between the waters of greatness and mediocrity to in the end become a sparingly thrilling yet forgettable telling of one unforgettable story. 3 ½ emaciated Thor's out of 5",In the Heart of the Sea
38,leonblackwood,Looks great but slightly boring in parts! 6/10,6,10 May 2016,"Review: As expected, this movie looked truly amazing and all of the effects were used to perfection but I did find the movie slightly boring in parts, and there wasn't much depth to the characters. Chris Hemsworth (Owen Chase) was perfect for the lead and Brendan Gleeson (Tom Nickerson) brought emotion to the project, as he shares his experience on the boat with Owen, to writer Herman Melville (Ben Whishaw), who finally writes the all time classic, Moby Dick. The extreme circumstances that the crew go through, whilst searching for whale oil, is extremely epic and you can't help feeling sorry for the whole crew but when I saw them killing the whales, it did sicken me. I was hoping for a twist at the end but the whole film is basically what it says on the tin. You certainly can see were every penny of the budget went, because all of the scenes, when they are stranded at sea, looked real and the actors gave there all by losing loads of weight, which made there circumstances seem realistic but I found it hard to connect to the various characters. In all, it's definitely an epic movie which is worth watching but I doubt that it will go down as an all time classic. Enjoyable! Round-Up: Chris Hemsworth, 32, started his acting career, for the big screen, in 2009 as George Kirk in Star Trek but he really shot to fame when he took the lead in Thor in 2011. Since then he has starred in the Cabin in the Woods, the Huntsman franchise, Red Dawn, Avengers franchise, Thor 2, Star Trek Into Darkness, Rush, Vacation and Blackhat, so he has definitely stroke it lucky with some of his major roles. With another Thor and Avengers in the pipeline, along with a role in the new Ghostbusters movie, he certainly has come far since his acting debut in Neighbours in 2002. Anyway, this movie was directed by the great Ron Howard, 62, who shot to fame after Splash was released in 1984. He has many hit movies under his belt, like Cocoon, Backdraft, Apollo 13, Ransom, A Beautiful Mind, Cinderella Man and the Da Vinci Code franchise, and with 10 movies in the pipeline, which includes Inferno with Tom Hanks, he is definitely one of the top directors in Hollywood today. Although this movie made a loss at the box office, I'm sure that it won't hurt his reputation.Budget: $100million Worldwide Gross: $94millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their biography/adventure/action movie starring Chris Hemsworth, Benjamin Walker, Cillian Murphy, Brendan Gleeson, Ben Whishaw and Michelle Fairley. 6/10",In the Heart of the Sea
39,matthewssilverhammer,Technically Proficient But Super Flat,4,18 December 2015,"Heart of the Sea is a mass-produced still-life painting: technically proficient but as flat as the canvas it's on. Technically, it's fine; the cinematography is interesting, the actors hit their marks, the sound is on point. But other than a few moments of nice humor and mild sea-faring thrills, the film lacks any spark. It's like director Howard and co. weren't that interested in creating an emotional, cerebral or exciting film, but more focused on simply getting the job done. The story of 19th century whaler Owen Chase (played by an oddly-accented Hemsworth), the influence for the literary classic Moby Dick, is a story worth knowing. However, the giant scale and obsession inherent in this tale is never fully conveyed, as Howard opts for computers and green screens, in lieu of the actual sea, to tell his story. So instead of a propulsive thriller or even a thoughtful psychological study, we get a generic and forgettable action/adventure, couched in boring characters. And much like the crew of the Essex itself, we are stranded in a seemingly endless sea of lackluster storytelling It also features some of the worst cinematic framing ever. Instead of just filming Moby Dick itself or just the story of real-life Owen Chase, they opt for a messy mash-up, constantly cutting away from the Essex's voyage to a recounting of the story to Melville; like bad narration taken to the nth degree. Even some marginally compelling moments showing the survival instincts of desperate people can't save this sinking ship. Watch Jaws, All is Lost, or Master and Commander if you want to take a worthwhile trip to the heart of the sea.",In the Heart of the Sea
40,subxerogravity,"Inspired Moby Dick, but is no Moby Dick, but it is visually effective.",7,12 December 2015,"Based on the story that inspired Moby Dick, its novelist, Herman Melville seeks out the survivor of the Whaling ship Essex to have him tell the tale of the white whale they encountered.I heard In the heart of the Sea was not action packed enough. It sounded like the best and only action sequences could be found in the trailer, but that was not the case at all. I found it pretty jammed packed with big adventure. From director Ron Howard showing us how to sail a ship, to the epic standoff between man and the world's largest mammal. They even get into how a whale is hunted and then gutted for oil, which won't make any PETA supporters happy.I would say the real issue is that since they are advertising the movie as the story that inspired Moby Dick, you would expect more whale than we actually got. The survivor telling the tale, Thomas Nickerson (played by Brendan Gleeson as an old man and Tom Holland as a Young one) began his story by telling us it was about the Captain and his first officer (played by Chris Hemsworth), and for the most part the movie was about how these two different men, from different social classes operate a ship. What I was most impressed with is that it was worth the IMAX 3D ticket. In the Heart of the Sea has so many fantastic visuals, and not just the eye candy that is Chris Hemsworth who was made to look quite heroic in the picture (or maybe I just could not get his image of Thor out of my head). A lot of the imagery was grim to give a realistic look at what it was like to be a sailor in the 1800s, it was brilliant cinematography.And the story that was told was very complete. I think I learned far too much about the political process and corruption of the whaling industry, back in the day, which is interesting, but does have the story lingering longer than you would expect.Overall, I'm impressed with the second effort Ron Howard and Chris Hemmisworth team up for after Rush.",In the Heart of the Sea

In the Heart of the Sea had a terrific cast and was directed by Ron Howard. I personally enjoy Ron Howard's historical films but In the Heart of the Sea was a lesser entry in that genre. The film had some great special effects and thrilling sequences where the characters hunt a whale.

43,PWNYCNY,Solid story about economic heroes.,8,5 October 2017,"A prequel to a work of fiction. The conflict between the captain and first mate, mentioned near the beginning of the movie is not borne out by the rest of the movie. In fact, all the characters are secondary to the whale whose presence dominates the story. It's all about the whale that refuses to die and trashes an entire ship. The movie does a good job in depicting the challenges associated with whaling and why it was such an important industry. Chris Hemsworth offers an excellent portrayal of the first mate, Chase, who is at odds with the captain, Pollard, who got the job through nepotism. The movie tries to play up the class differences separating the two men, but the captain isn't arrogant enough nor the first mate resentful enough to generate any intense drama. Whether all the crew will survive is another question, and it is that aspect of the story that gives the movie its dramatic power. These men risked their lives to fuel the country and were the heroes of their time. The movie shows that and for that reason is worth watching.",In the Heart of the Sea

It's directed by Ron Howard-Rush, The Da Vinci Code, Apollo 13-and tells the story of the whaling ship Essex and it's fate in the 1820's-it sank under mysterious circumstances. Ben plays Herman Melville, an aspiring author that wants to write a story about the Essex. He tracks down Brendon, one of the only living survivors of the Essex, and entices him to tell his secret story. Most of the tale is told in flashback, with Tom playing the younger version of Brendon. Tom is a cabin boy on the Essex along with Chris as the first mate and Cillian as another shipmate and long time friend of Chris'. There is the well known encounter with the giant whale, that wrecks havoc on their poor ship, leaving not much but kindling floating in the water. The survivors manage to get to life boats but discover that they are stranded far from home with not much food or water and no sense of direction-it seems that they lost their compass during the destruction of their boat. To make matters worse, the gigantor whale seems to be following them. It is an interesting story. It's rated ""PG-13"" for action, peril and violence and has a running time of 2 hours & 1 minutes.

45,CubsandCulture,Fans of the genre or people interested in the Age of Sail should be pleased,8,27 April 2021,I am a huge fan of films dealing with this general time period and several of my favorite media works are about men combating the seas under the press of sail. I think this film is a good example of the genre. It is an engaging in an old-fashioned sort of way while having top notch production values. I do think the film is a little bit episodic and a bit strained. That cannibalism is treated as the ultimate horror of the story comes a bit out of left field; the climatic sequence lands less horrifying than how the filmmakers intended. I also wish the film downplayed the Moby Dick connection as the story stands on its own without leaning into inspiring Melville-this is a bigger deal than might be apparent because either Tom Holland or Brendan Gleeson is miscast as they do not seem like the same man.The film captures the visceral aspects of whaling; an early sequence of processing a whale for its usable parts is probably the best part of the film. It comes across as authentic and those images stay with you. This is a engaging film; It could have been better.,In the Heart of the Sea
46,peterp-450-298716,There wasn't really Moby Dick. But that Pollard fellow was a ... euh .... yep,5,5 January 2016,"""The tragedy of the Essex is the story of men. And a Demon."" When I was young, I had a huge reading book about Moby Dick. I gazed at the rich illustrations for hours and eagerly I read about the adventures of Ishmael aboard the Pequod. And I can still see the final drawing before my eyes, with Captain Ahab hanging in the ropes of his harpoon against Moby Dick diving into the ocean. Maybe my expectations were too high for ""In the Heart of the Sea"" and I hoped to see a similar scene. Unfortunately, it wasn't really a movie about a battle between man and whale. It was more something like ""Stranded"". But taking place on sea. The rivalry between Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth) and Captain Pollard (Benjamin Walker) was more interesting than the whaling itself. And did you watch the trailer? Well that means you have already seen the most impressive images of the psychopathic white sperm whale.I'm sure it was more exciting and terrifying for sailors in those days as it is for film fans watching this movie. Imagine them sitting in a wobbly little wooden rowing boat, throwing that gigantic harpoon at a huge sperm whale which swims under their boat. And after that, they needed to get that colossus on board to collect that precious whale oil. A raw material which was necessary in the 19th century to keep those lamps burning. The film begins at the port of Nantucket around 1819. Chase tells his pregnant wife he's signing in on the Essex to go hunting for whales and that he probably won't be in time to witness her giving birth. Beautiful computer-generated images show how daily life looked like in those days. Only Chase's dream to be captain of the Essex is harpooned (how appropriate) immediately. The job goes to one certain George Pollard. Not because of his extensive knowledge and experience in terms of floating around on such a large boat, but because of the fact that he's a descendant of an aristocratic, wealthy family.The film includes three successive story lines. First, there's the competition between Pollard and Chase. After that the two fighting cocks bury the hatchet when the crazy white sperm starts attacking them. And then the defeated survivors reconcile while drifting hopelessly around on the ocean, a few thousand miles from South America in rowboats, after the Essex sank. And there's a witness of this story namely Thomas Nickerson (Tom Holland) who's a shipmate. He's (Brendan Gleeson) now the last witness of this shipwreck. He tells the complete story, after much encouragement, to Herman Melville (Ben Whishaw), who uses these notes afterwards, after subjecting it to a thorough censorship and keeping the rough lines, for his successful novel ""Moby Dick"". And so the circle is complete.In terms of decor and images, this film is quite magnificent. The raging sea with his pounding, foaming, giant waves. The stately ship that cleaves through the ocean. The views of the medieval harbor town and the decoration of Tom's house. And finally the stunning images of a school of whales and the whale hunt itself. Unfortunately the scarred white whale came into the picture far too little. You can compare it a bit with the last Godzilla movie. The monster is there, but there's hardly anything to see of it. The sense of menace and being hunted, was truly there at times. But the insertion of the rounds of conversation between Tom and Herman reduced the pace of this movie drastically. The result is a slow historical drama, instead of a thrilling spectacle at sea with a pseudo Moby Dick in the lead.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",In the Heart of the Sea
47,Samiam3,It sails and then it sinks,5,23 May 2017,"In scene one, Herman Melville meets a whaler who tells a tale worthy of the ages. His ship was smashed in by a 100 foot white sperm whale, and the survivors were adrift at sea for weeks until they had no food left ....except each other.This medium budget sea epic from Ron Howard is not a bad movie, but it isn't any good either. In the first hour, it succeeds in building some momentum as we set out to sea with Chris Hemsworth and we sail right into a storm. To Howard's credit, he has a very distinctive way of shooting these scenes that is both immersive and allows the CGI to blend in. The picture looks as if we are seeing it through a spy glass, with drops of spray in the lens creating a surreal like soft focus. Some of this technique was visible in his previous film Rush but was less effective and resulted in a blurry picture.Hemsworth succeeds in commanding the screen with his bravado and virtuousness for a good while. Unlike in Rush, his character comes from a place of melancholy rather than ego. He is the smartest sailor on a ship that is under the command of a rookie and inexperienced captain, appointed at the request of the Whaling company. As is typical of Hollywood movies, the individuals representing commerce and industry are one dimensional and vilified. This development is as annoying as it is unnecessary.The movie has dozens of computer generated whales, which are competently rendered but animated to swim at hyper realistic, unconvincing speeds. The star of the sea is the great white whale who wreaks havoc on our small band of sailors. From this point on the movie sinks with the ship.The last act is dreary, emotional detached, and strangely paced. Potetially compelling scenes feel as if they were cut short in order to make a two hour running length. Hemsworth and his mates drift along in their whaleboats while their beards grow between the cuts, and the giant whale pops up a few more times to attack. One problem is that this Moby Dick doesn't have enough sense of menace; he never shows his teeth (both literally and figuratively). Melville's Moby Dick was a beast, this whale is just an animal.As a tale of survival, In the Heart of the Sea feels lacking because it feels rushed. The material may have been better suited to a three part mini-series, a format that would give the characters more room to breath. In a good survival tale, the characters come away finding their humanity or something meaningful, none of that is visible here. Instead, the punchline of the film is that this story was the inspiration for one of the greatest pieces of American prose. That in itself does carry some meaning, but not enough to make the film worth watching.",In the Heart of the Sea
48,davidmvining,A solid adventure that should have dropped the Moby Dick connection,7,21 November 2019,"They should not have included the connection to Moby Dick. I thought it was just a marketing gimmick, but Herman Melville is a character and the impetus for the overall framing device. I imagine that it's true that Melville used the story of the ""Essex"" as partial inspiration for his grand opus (perhaps the greatest novel written in the English language, in my humble opinion), but is that necessary information to tell the story that enticed him in the first place? The story of the ""Essex"" is interesting on its own. It doesn't need Herman Melville to help tell it, but maybe that was the point. ""No one will care about a story of a whaling ship in 1820, but if you add Moby Dick to the marketing, you'll get  in seats. All the kids love Moby Dick!""That's really my only explanation for why Melville was included. They needed to help sell the narrative and the film overall to skeptical audiences who might not be interested in a story of a whaler from 200 years ago, but no one cares about Moby Dick other than me and other nerds. I can't imagine the addition added much in terms of box office since it was such a dud there anyway.Moving on, though. The Melville sections that largely bookend the story (and pop up from time to time in the middle) are fine on their own. Well acted and photographed, so at least there's that. Inside the actual story, though, we do have a compelling narrative that's about more than just a whale. And that's where I think the Melville sections undermine the whole movie. The story of the ""Essex"" is about more than just a giant, angry, and vengeful sperm whale. It's the story of a crew sent on a dangerous mission where most died and the few that did survive only did so through the most extreme of circumstances and methods. The men involved are interesting, especially the central conflict between the untested Captain that comes from a naval family and the experienced first mate who comes from a family of landsmen. It's a clash of personalities and hubris that carries the movie quite well.The movie also looks good. It doesn't go for strict realism, instead we have a more painterly vision of the aesthetics of life at sea. The waves almost look like they have brushstrokes guiding them. The lighting is always used to maximum effect with the sun popping up in just the right place for a pretty view, even in the face of total destruction. I really like how the movie almost had an oil painting look from beginning to end, although the Melville segments are far more darkly and realistically shot.Overall, I finally got into the movie after the whale attack, which was about halfway through the movie. From then on, I was completely on board, enjoying the tale of desperation and survival that was the ""Essex"" looking for rescue. Perhaps the movie could have been great, but I do think that it ended up distracted at times, but ultimately good.",In the Heart of the Sea

50,jadepietro,Water Logged,6,20 December 2015,"(Rating: ☆☆☆ out of 4)This film is mildly recommended. In brief: The film barely stays afloat once the exhilarating attack is over.GRADE: B-Ron Howard's In the Heart of the Sea is an epic adventure film that treads water when it's not on the high seas. As long as it stays that course, the film is a remarkable achievement in CGI and rollicking entertainment. But once that initial conflict, between Moby and Man is done, alas, so is the film, even if the film is far from over.￼Now one would think that a film based on a book by Nathaniel Philbrick, which is based on the Melville classic, which was originally based on a seafarer's account of a true story would be smooth sailing, having had this many sources to fall back upon. In fact, as our story begins, the film frames its fictional story with a flashback plot device connecting all of the inspirational causes as Mr. Melville himself (Ben Whishaw) listens to a harrowing conversation from a survivor (Brendan Gleeson) of the Big White. ￼ We travel back in time to 1819 and learn of the final voyage of a whaling ship called the Essex and its ill-fated crew. Our manly hero, Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth), a devoted family man and seafarer, comes aboard with the likes of an inexperienced captain named George Pollard (Benjamin Walker), which almost seals his fate from the get-go. Soon they all set sail on the treacherous waters of the Pacific, in search of whale. Of course, they do find it, in one very angry sperm whale who wants to even the score.￼This is foremost an adventure yarn reminiscent of old Hollywood studio standards, but given a state-of-the art revamp. Howard knows how to stage the action very effectively. He sets up his characters and tries to give them some back-stories before the hunt begins, but it all seems too contrived and stagy. (Whenever one promises to return safely, we already know that won't be the case.) However, once the attack begins, it is so well crafted and thrillingly photographed by Anthony Dod Mantle, that the moviegoer is transported to a wonderful visceral experience. ￼But the aftermath of the brutal tail-lashing and its consequent outcome of the few survivors is anti-climatic rather than engrossing. Some of the fault must go to a script in search of a re- write that never develops any characters beyond their stereotypes, using them as mere props than people. ￼Hemsworth and the other actors do a yeoman-like job of bringing more gravitas to their roles, but, let's face it, the fish upstages everything up there on the screen. In the Heart of the Sea is a man vs. nature tale in which man again loses...and so does the moviegoer.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",In the Heart of the Sea

The man refuses to speak but his wife insists otherwise so he starts. Owen Chase convinces his wife all will be better as he gets his captaincy. But the executives have him as first mate instead on his next whaling journey aboard the Essex, accommodating young Captain George Pollard. After they set out Owen shows he's the de facto captain with his skills and initiative. One day the captain orders the crew to head into a squall despite Owen's warning. As the ship gets damaged the captain orders to turn around, but the waves wreak havoc to the ship. This starts open animosity between George and Owen, but they hold it for the whale oil they're after.They capture a whale, having young Nickerson slip inside the head to scoop leftover oil. But no whale for them on the next months. After sailing far they meet a Spanish captain informing them a large whale pack's location, there's also a 'demon' whale. Both George and Owen agree to chase the pack. They reach the place and soon finds the 'demon', a 30-foot long white whale. It easily damages the Essex' hull, forcing the crew to abandon her. They rig makeshift boats with the sails and ration the limited provisions. The crew face friction among them. After some days adrift, Owen spots the demon whale following them. The second mate Matthew Joy gets injured in a storm. Again Owen spots the demon whale; this time it attacks the boats, killing some men. They get washed ashore to an island. But after some time Owen proposes to leave since no boats will come.They go, leaving the injured Matthew and three others. Some more days adrift, one of the men dies. As rations scarce over, Owen proposes they eat the remains to survive, and so they do. The men in George's boat even draw straws to determine who should sacrifice himself to be the next meal. And again they spot the 'demon'. The crew cooperate and Owen gains a killing shot position. But he and the whale exchange stares, cancelling Owen's throw. They eventually get rescued. Arriving back in Nantucket, Owen and George are intimidated by the executives, forcing them to lie in the upcoming inquiry. But Owen refuses. George eventually tells the truth in the inquiry, and Owen moves from Nantucket.Okay, this movie proves to be a really annoying mix for me. It's that good that all the scenes with the demon whale are indeed intimidating, and I say this without watching the 3D version. And the cast did adequate acting level to bring the drama part alive. Yet in overall concept the movie tried so hard in balancing between the original story behind the novel, and giving a display of great adventure.The movie often times gets to feel so slow, especially on the opening twenty to thirty minutes. If it wanted to be that kind of dramatic, the movie shouldn't have been promoted heavier on the adventure side. All those scenes of getting back to old Nickerson and Melville's conversation really broke the movie's pace and flow.Yet I have to hand it to the movie makers, the adventure sequences look great. All the wrecking ship sequences look very much believable and edited very nicely with nice camera angles supporting the cinematography. As I said earlier, the demon whale looks very much intimidating. Also the movie managed to retain that aura through the repetitive encounters it has with the crew.The acting in overall still feels awkward. The cast as a whole did adequately in giving lives to their characters. It feels that the movie itself didn't really develop them well enough. Chris Hemsworth's character's commanding presence was done well by the man, despite that the character didn't have more to tell. Benjamin Walker did just enough to balance Hemsworth, effectively portraying George's envy over the first mate's command over the men. Cillian Murphy's talent really feels under-utilized here and Tom Holland did well for a warm up before his much anticipated comic book based movie.For me a score of 6 out of 10 is deserving for this movie. A recommendation would've been a yes when it first came out, but for now I think it's best to just wait for next week's blockbuster.",In the Heart of the Sea
52,EdgarST,The Power of the Young,4,10 June 2018,"Not a good movie. But the story of the young impressed me deeply: the young Thomas Nickerson, who survived to tell the story; and Henry Coffin, the faithful relative of Captain Pollard. Two strong characters, genuine, vulnerable, emotional. One fearful and humble; the other, an arrogant climber. The rest of the characters are stereotypes, buried under macho posing, cheap melodrama by courtesy of the female characters (how unfair, with all those weeping, boring hunks), gallons of unbearable music and tons of special effects.Apart from Nickerson and Coffin, I have to give credit to the powerful sinking sequence of the Essex, an effective evocation of people aboard a boat being hit by a giant sea creature.",In the Heart of the Sea
53,Easygoer10,It's A Shame,6,8 July 2019,"It is truly a shame how bad this film is, when you have read the novel beforehand. I read it when it came out; over a dozen years before Ron Howard tried, but failed miserably in his film. The sinking of ""The Essex"" was to the 19th Century, what the ""Titanic"" sinking was to the 20th Century. Not in the loss of life (of course), but the sheer magnitude of the story. Most people (by far) had never heard of The Essex before ""The Heart of the Sea"" book came out. I am glad they kept the name of the book to use for the film. When reading, one almost cannot stop until finishing, it is such a brilliant book. As far as the film, the special effects are very good. The cast is quite good, although the accents and dialogue leave much to be desired. I think the screenplay takes far too much time on Melville interviewing Mr. Nickerson. After all, this is without a doubt one of the best non-fiction novels I have ever read. A real stunner. I am not a huge fan of Ron Howard, but I respect his talent, when it is shown. Unfortunately, that does not occur here. Perhaps visually it is good, but that is it. I gave it an average rating (a 5); however, the book would get a 9 out of 10, easily.",In the Heart of the Sea
54,moviexclusive,"A handsomely old-fashioned sea-faring yarn that could do with a lot more character work, Ron Howard's Man-versus-Nature saga finds its own heart somewhat lost at sea",7,2 December 2015,"'In the Heart of the Sea' is not 'Moby Dick'. Instead, it is based on Nathaniel Philbrick's non-fiction book of the same name, which was itself drawn from real events surrounding the Nantucket whaling ship Essex that was allegedly sunk by a giant sperm whale in the western Pacific on November 20, 1820. Out of the 21 men who made it out alive, only eight eventually survived the ordeal in the open sea, and there are accounts from two – one, the ship's first mate Owen Chase; and two, a 14-year-old cabin boy named Thomas Nickerson who waited 55 years to write his side of the story which ended up lost until 1980.Even though young Melville's (Ben Whishaw) interview with the truculent Nickerson (Brendan Gleeson) bookends the film, let it first be known that these scenes are in fact fiction, for there is no way that the real-life Melville could have access to Nickerson's memoir, since the book 'Moby Dick' was published in 1851. Notwithstanding that it is a classical framing device for a tall tale, there is no denying that these portions are redundant and quite the unnecessary distraction in between critical points of the Essex's doomed voyage, redeemed only somewhat by Gleeson's performance of such dignity and sadness at the dire circumstances that he had to confront in order to survive on few provisions for 90 days.It is Gleeson's narration that brings us back to 1820 Nantucket, where we are first introduced to Chris Hemsworth's Chase, a proud whaler excited at the prospect of commanding his own ship. Alas, its business owners who had before promised Owen his boat decide to make him nursemaid Pollard (Benjamin Walker), whose only qualification is that his father is the company's patron. Despite his frustration and his wife's (Charlotte Riley) reservations about that particular expedition, Owen eventually sets sail with George and the rest of the crew, which includes his best friend Matthew Joy (Cillian Murphy), the young Nickerson (Tom Holland, or soon-to-be 'Spidey'), and George's cousin Owen Coffin (Frank Dillane).As expected, tension soon builds between the experienced first mate and the inexperienced but eager-to-prove-himself captain. In the first of three major action sequences, George orders the Essex to sail head on into a squall against Owen's advice as a test of mettle for the crew, an ill decision that almost capsizes the ship and seemingly pits the two men squarely against each other. Thrilling as that setup may be, Charles Leavitt's screenplay gives the officer- versus-officer conflict short shrift in the later acts.Losing no momentum, Owen soon chances upon the sound of whales exhaling air through their blowholes; how Owen and his men kill and capture a full-grown male is shown in exhilarating detail, as much as the later operation to harvest its fats for oil is displayed in full gory glory (especially a sequence where the young Nickerson is thrust down a hole in the whale's head to scoop out the prized sperm oil). Yet, bad luck immediately after forces George to bring the Essex into uncharted waters to hunt for pods, and the last of the big-bang sequences you'll get is the encounter with the big one, described by a Spanish captain the crew meet on a stopover at Atacames who lost his arm and six other men as measuring almost 100 metres in length and whose hide is alabaster white.Howard and cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle do not disappoint; that single encounter is single-handedly the highlight of the entire film, edge-of-your-seat gripping, breathtakingly staged, and enough to silence the hubris of any man who thinks he is superior to Mother Nature's creations. It ends with the Essex in flames and the surviving crewmen in three whaleboats, and so begins a much more sombre and deliberately paced final act which chronicles the harrowing aftermath, with the men forced to brave storms, starvation, panic and despair. It is here that we find out just what has been disturbing Nickerson all these years – when staring starvation in the face, the men would be forced to eat their dead shipmates or draw lots for one of them to be sacrificed.Hemsworth's dramatic weight loss to play a sunken Owen is clearly evident, as is the dedication by the other cast members to portray their characters' afflictions with utmost realism. Yet, coming after films such as 'Castaway' or even 'Life of Pi', we'd be lying if we said it was new or surprising. Both of those movies however managed a deeper emotional resonance because they gave us characters which we actually care about, the same of which cannot be said here. Owen's obsession with the giant whale that seems to be following them is never quite explained, nor for the matter why the animal shown to evoke some sort of mythical terror would do so. How the friction between Owen and George gives way to mutual respect is also glossed over, and the same goes for the discord between George and his cousin whom the former lectures earlier for abusing familial privilege.In the absence of more compelling character drama, all we are left with is an old-fashioned seafaring adventure and an ageless tale of men forced to do the unthinkable in order to survive the odds of nature. Being the consummate storyteller he is, Howard excels in both regards, and there is never a dull moment in his film. Yet, as much as this story of ordinary men pitted against their own moral fiber fits squarely within Howard's oeuvre, it ultimately comes up much less because it fails to define the men themselves, or their raison d'etre for going at each other. Ironically, 'In the Heart of the Sea' could do with a lot more heart at its core, seeing as how it wants to be more, much more, than just the battle with the whale that was 'Moby Dick'.",In the Heart of the Sea
55,quincytheodore,Memory of waves and whales,7,7 December 2015,"It is said that we understand more about space than our own sea, although one thing both realms have in common is the propensity to convey epic journeys to silver screen. There's an inherent romantic feel to maritime life, even as a tragic showing like Life of Pi or Titanic. This is the same attribute ""In the Heart of the Sea"" has, and even though there are minor blemishes, it still produces a good human drama shown by impeccable visual atmosphere.This is a retelling of a particular ship's ordeal, also an inspiration for the novel Moby Dick. It is told from an account of then young crew member, he now tells the story of adventure and misery in his older days. While it's a good ground for characterization and set-up, it might overhype its own story and break the pacing slightly. Fortunately, Brendan Gleeson and Michelle Fairley are capable enough to maintain their own mini subplot.The actual voyage consists of two leads, Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth) and George Pollard (Benjamin Walker). Owen is a veteran sailor, who is promised a captain seat, but ultimately denied of the right because of nepotism favoring George. The two collides frequently, and more than once their dispute ends up bringing malady to the ship and its crew.Chris Hemsworth is a great actor, however this is not the same level of rivalry he had in Rush. It is by no fault of Benjamin Walker who does try to fulfill the role, but he doesn't portray the personality clash of an epic saga. In fact, Hemsworth has more connection with Gillian Murphy, the third in command, even though they have lesser screen time together. The rest of the crew isn't compelling enough, in exception of young Nickerson who will eventually narrates it.For most part the visual is splendid, mainly when it transcends the barrier between sea line and underwater. On some scenes it pans out so nicely it brings an alluringly harrowing view of ocean, its human drifters and beastly occupants. It has overall bluish tone that keeps the cold isolation vibe while the gigantic whale, though we know it's CG as whale is too much of a diva to work with, is still pretty convincing in close up.Plot keeps a straightforward momentum, although it may be inconsistent sometimes. There are parts where it seems to dawdle for ten or fifteen minute more than needs be, while some scenes are cut short and ultimately feels disjointed. It's not a big issue, but it does make the story skips rather abruptly or plods at times.In the Heart of the Sea is an interesting excursion with fine visual. Granted, it doesn't navigate well enough under some waves, yet this homage to a great classic has its enchanting and inspiring moments.",In the Heart of the Sea
56,tomsview,Kiss my flukes,8,12 April 2016,"There is a scene in the film, just after the whale messes with the whalers for the first time, where as it swims away, it flips its tail almost as if to say, ""Kiss this!""In reality the whale didn't do half the things it does in the movie, it sank the Essex and swam away end of. And it wasn't white.I don't think director Ron Howard and the filmmakers should have stretched the truth quite as much as they did with the story of the 1820 sinking of the Essex in the Pacific by a huge sperm whale. Five-minutes of Googling reveals the facts, and there was also an excellent documentary, ""The Essex: The True Story of Moby Dick"", which anyone with the History Channel probably saw.Mind you, that is my only reservation about this film, which I think is beautifully made and totally absorbing.I loved John Huston's Moby Dick, which I first saw in wide-eyed wonder in 1956; it's been a favourite ever since. I suspect it may have also influenced Ron Howard, because his movie captures that same feeling of divine mission and the ominous sense of doom that pervades Huston's masterpiece, not to mention Melville's novel itself. But Howard had something to hand that Huston would have dearly loved to have had - awesome special effects.What a look ""In the Heart of the Sea"" has, it's a work of art from beginning to end; a visual feast. It doesn't look totally real, but rather is beautifully stylised with mood to spare. I was reminded of the paintings of marine artist John Stobart, although I didn't see his name in the credits, anyone familiar with his work will know what I mean.The cast brings the characters alive. Chris Hemsworth plays a somewhat abrasive character as first mate Owen Chase. His 'Bligh/Christian' rivalry with Captain George Pollard (Benjamin Walker) gives the movie a sharp edge. Adding the finishing touch is a fine orchestral score by Roque Banos, at once epic and tragic.Why wasn't the movie more successful? Possibly people just don't like seeing whales killed - I know I don't. In defence of the whalers back when this film was set is the fact that whale oil seemed more of a necessity, and also that the whale had more of a chance. One head butt or tail flick could spell disaster for men in a flimsy whale boat - it took real cojones to be a whaler.Despite a whale that refuses to leave the stage, ""In the Heart of the Sea"" is a superb movie, exciting, thought provoking and visually dazzling; it should be added to the list of great films about men at sea.",In the Heart of the Sea
57,krocheav,Parallel Situations and Awesome Seas,9,16 November 2016,"Some viewers have been hard to please with this superior epic - seems maybe too many could have fallen victim to the 60sec TV commercial concentration syndrome. While it might have been a trifle stilted to begin with, it certainly more than makes up for it by the finale. What happens to the Essex and her crew is truly horrendous. Ron Howard is a director of better than average caliber and here he excels himself with a study of the factual incident, that inspired the great Herman Melville to pen his classic novel Moby Dick.The visuals and effects are nothing short of breathtaking - this is as close as you'll get to the experience of being on board an 18th century deep water sail vessel. Every aspect of wind and sea are unleashed as this craft goes out after the great Whales of the deep - dead calms to raging fury are thrown at us in all their natural spectacle. The whales are magnificently portrayed as they are relentlessly pursued by men in puny sea-craft.The protector of the flock is gigantic and the fury this beast unleashes on its pursuers is nothing less than fearsome. This is classic turning around the rules of the game, with hunters becoming the hunted. It brings to mind somewhat paralleled events in Spain (where this film was produced) also in a Peruvian Bullfighting ring just recently (See Metro News clip on YouTube: where powerful and intelligent Bulls come to a stop in the arena - look up at the people shouting for the kill then astoundingly leap up & climb over the wall to take-on the crowd!. A rare occurrence that left me applauding for the doomed Bull.When it comes to scripts, Howard is known for embellishing the truth (as most do) for the sake of entertainment but, I did not find it overly objectionable within this inspiring work. Period details are wonderful and as with Melville's novel, the character studies have not been sacrificed for the sake of needless action - as we've come to expect from certain heralded, dill-thrill, mile-a-minute film makers. A thoughtful music score given a full symphonic treatment adds the vital finish. Any viewer wanting to follow a good historical story and be thrilled along the journey should enjoy this highly charged epic of the sea.",In the Heart of the Sea

59,Screen_Blitz,Visually striking adventure with decent storytelling,8,12 December 2015,"From the brilliant director Ron Howard (Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind) comes a fantastic, if noticeably flawed retelling of the real-life events set in the 1820s that inspired the writing of Herman Melville's classic novel 'Moby Dick'. In The Heart of The Sea is certainly no masterpiece in any form, but it shows director Ron Howard demonstrating his filmmaking talent in arguably one of his finest fashions yet. Set in the early 19th century, Chris Hemsworth plays Owen Chase, a husband and soon-to-be father living in New England, who along with Captain Pollard (played by Benjamen Walker), leads a crew of sailors on a ship known as the 'Essex' on an expedition to acquire whale across the Atlantic ocean. In the process, the crew is faced with a series of unpleasant situations including violent thunderstorms and an attack of a giant killer whale that leads to the destruction of their ship. Faced with heavy casualties and plagued by starvation, Chase and the crew takes some extreme measures to survive while stranded at sea in the middle of nowhere. This story is told by Owen Chase in his later years who tells the story to Herman Melville (played by Ben Whishaw) as he writes the novel. This film features the supporting cast of Tom Holland, Cillian Murphy, Brendan Gleeson, Frank Dilane, Gary Deadle, and several others.This film does not exactly live up to its full potential, nor is it confined from a small range of shortcomings in some areas, but it greatly benefits from Ron Howard's thoughtful storytelling and a plethora of solid performances by a likable including Chris Hemsworth, Benjamin Walker, and Cillian Murphy who engage in most of the spotlight throughout the picture. The rest of the supporting cast on the other hand, sadly fall victim to characters who suffer from a lack of development to make us care for them on their ill-fates voyage, although their performances aren't necessarily bad. The film, however, manages to fuel itself with visionary storytelling, enticing suspense uprooted in the scenes of the characters' encounter with the giant whale, and some captivating visuals of the ocean that somewhat make up for the lack of emotional depth and character construction that could have rewarded in a more engaging story. Fornately, Ron Howard has plenty of offer in the narrative department as as he beautifully paints the astonishing true events that took place and the tragedy that struck in their journey across sea. Highlighting the details of the cold conflict for leadership between Owen Chase and Captain Pollard, the devastation of the whale attack, and the aftermath that plagued the crew members physically and emotionally, the film successfully racks up the gritty atmosphere of the ill-fates journey without pulling many punches with it's unfortunate lack of depth. This is greatly demonstrated in the thunderstorm sequence as well as scenes of the killer whale wrecking havoc to the Essex which both nicely stand with beautiful (and terrifying) cinematography. Apart from the shortage of emotional resonance, the story does flounder from a fairly inconsistent pace, especially during the second half. But Ron Howard luckily knows how to keep things moving even during the dullest scenes. His greatest success comes not just from his storytelling, but his solid ability to effectively portray human drama and balance with pinches of action. In the Heart of the Sea is a solid film uprooted by the effective directorial efforts by Ron Howard. This film definitely will not please those are expecting much more from a film inspired a timeless classic tale. But those who are fans of the cast, or interested in its compelling story behind Herman Melville's classic literary work and Howard's direction are definite targets for this one.",In the Heart of the Sea

62,blott2319-1,Dramatic and powerful deviation from Moby Dick,7,29 June 2020,"In the Heart of the Sea is intended to be the true story that inspired the book Moby Dick, and from what little I know of that novel, I think this is a deviation from what Melville wrote (Not that it bothered me.) It tells the story of a group of whalers in the 1800s who run into some troubles when they are confronted by a giant white whale that is too much for them to handle. I found the movie quite intriguing as it shows how whale-hunting worked back in those days, and then showed the risks that could come with the work. It certainly helped that they cast so many great actors in the film, because they were able to elevate what could have been a more run-of-the-mill adventure on the high seas. It is brutal and hard to watch at times, but I think that's the point of the story. Aside from some of the more unpleasant things that happen in the film, it was also hard to watch at times because the CGI left something to be desired. I know filming on the water is a logistical nightmare, and they certainly can't train a bunch of whales of this size, so CGI was the only way to go with a lot of these shots. I only wish they had spent a bit more time making some of these effects seamless. They are able to hide some of it with darkness and rain, but there are many scenes where the artificiality of everything threatened to take me out of the movie.I thought it was interesting what they decided to include when writing In the Heart of the Sea, because there is an ending to the story that feels final enough to be satisfying. However, the movie doesn't just want to explore the disaster that occurs in the film, but also how corporations would handle this kind of thing. (Hint: it's not all that different than how corporations would act now, as they are always looking out for their bottom line.) I like that added layer to the story, and it made the film seem more relevant. I think one of the reasons that this movie didn't do so well in theaters is that people expected the whale to be a central figure in the story, and they expected Chris Hemsworth to be a pseudo-Captain Ahab, since it results in the book we know as Moby Dick. However, In the Heart of the Sea is more concerned with the crew, and the whale is merely a mechanism to get events moving forward. Perhaps that's why a later scene, when things have somewhat changed between the crew and the white whale, felt a bit awkward and out-of-place. It seemed like they were trying to make the whale more of a character in that moment, which I don't think they earned. Otherwise, I was whole-heartedly invested in this film, and I think In the Heart of the Sea was a good surprise that was better than the reviews implied.",In the Heart of the Sea

If you want it to be memorable, you need to give it dimension, form, purpose and some intrigue. That is missing here and I am surprised that it is considering Ron Howard directed this. As to Chris Hemsworth, I am not sure he can carry a picture as a leading man. His verbal and emotional skills are not quite as fully developed as his body is. To be fair, this movie is not Moby Dick but instead the story that inspired it. When the words Moby Dick are conjured, one thinks of Gregory Peck as Captain Ahab and all the other colorful characters in the classic movie of its time. Here, we are given a story that needs our help to be entertaining when we should be since we paid to be so. If there are deleted scenes that will come out on a Blue Ray, this will help it along.

64,Andy-296,"Great movie, stunningly filmed, surprisingly compelling",9,1 January 2016,"A terrific adventure movie directed by Ron Howard, whose movies I generally don't like. Here, though, he has come up with a very entertaining film and a nice, intelligent take on Moby Dick.The movie's ingenious framing device has a young Hermann Melville (played by Ben Whishaw) in Nantucket, Massachusetts in 1850 trying to interview an initially reluctant old shipwreck from a whaling boat, expecting he will give him some interesting material for his new book. The shipwreck (played by Brendan Gleeson) finally is enticed (a bit by money and a bit by the pleadings of his wife) to tell Melville the haunting story of the Essex, which really happened some thirty years earlier. The movie then goes, in a flashback that lasts for the rest of its running time, to tell that story: Chris Hemsworth is Owen Chase, the temperamental first mate, who comes from a working class background, has a lot of experience in successful whaling and wants to become a captain for the next mission. But the whaling company decides to give the captaincy to the young, snobbish George Pollard (played by Benjamin Walker, who looks a lot like a young Colin Firth), who happens to be the son of one of the owners, and will soon shown himself to be insecure and inexperienced. As the old, wooden boat weathers its first storm in the Atlantic, it is clear that Pollard' seafaring abilities are no match for Chase. The Essex then crosses to the Pacific to hunt whales, but the whaling grounds are depleted. On advice from an old sailor they met at a stop in Ecuador, Pollard decides to go 2,000 miles west of South America, a very remote place far from any regular ships at the time. There they will eventually find a large shoal of whales, but also more than they bargained for (I won't reveal more about the plot, but being a take on Moby Dick you will probably imagine which way it will go).Entertainingly and stunningly filmed (Howard had the benefit of a large budget), the only drawback is that the constant moving of the camera during the sea scenes might make you a bit dizzy at times.",In the Heart of the Sea

66,dglink,"Flawed, but Still Exciting and Entertaining",8,5 December 2017,"Inspired by true events, Ron Howard's ""In the Heart of the Sea"" is a literate, often exciting tale that is at once historical and informative, exciting and action filled, grueling and tragic. Charles Leavitt's well-written screenplay was based on a book by Nathaniel Philbrick, In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex, which purports to show the events that inspired Herman Melville to write Moby Dick. In the middle of the 19th century, the young Melville travels to Nantucket and seeks out the last survivor of the whaling ship Essex, which disappeared thirty years earlier with much controversy. After some persuasion and with enough cash, Melville, played by Ben Wishaw, convinces Brendan Gleeson as Tom Nickerson to relate the shocking story, which Nickerson has not even shared with his wife, played by Michelle Fairley. The film's acting honors go to the seasoned trio featured in the Melville-Nickerson scenes, which flash back to the story of the Essex as Gleeson relates the events.The actual tale of the Essex begins with Owen Chase, a strapping young seaman, who aspires to be captain of a whaler and has been promised a captaincy by the local shipowners. However, he is forced to accept first-mate status under an inexperienced captain, who has family connections. Chris Hemsworth certainly looks the part of Chase, a role that would have suited the young Sterling Hayden. Hemsworth's heroic looks, which at times resemble the youthful Nick Nolte, are perhaps too California-surfer to be convincing as a rugged seafarer. However, while he does have physical presence, a better actor could have deepened the characterization. The same comments apply to Benjamin Walker, who plays Chase's nemesis, Captain George Pollard, an untested captain who steers his ship and men carelessly into peril. Meanwhile, Cillian Murphy as Matthew Joy and Tom Holland as the young version of Nickerson provide able support among Pollard's crew.Set to a beautiful score by Roque Baños, the film features exciting whale-hunting scenes, a fierce storm at sea, and a harrowing tale of survival. However, ""In the Heart of the Sea"" illustrates the importance of a strong lead even in a film rich with special effects and action at sea. Without Russell Crowe, ""Master and Commander"" would not have succeeded as it did; with actors of Crowe's caliber in the roles of Chase and Pollard, the film could have been a titanic clash of wills set against the forces of nature in the guise of a monstrous whale. However, even with its flaws, ""In the Heart of the Sea"" is fine entertainment, despite its failure to attain the heights to which director Howard aspired.",In the Heart of the Sea

68,petra_ste,Lightweight whale,6,12 April 2016,"Ron Howard's Moby Dick would be a funny thing indeed - like Michael Bay's Crime and Punishment. Howard has landed a few solid genre films (Ransom, Apollo 13...), but he is essentially a vanilla director making vanilla movies - a bad match for Melville's metaphysical masterpiece.Thankfully, the connection with Moby Dick is a lot feebler; In the Heart of the Sea is an adaptation of Nathaniel Philbrick's excellent novel, based on a true event - the sinking of the ship Essex by a whale - which inspired Melville's classic.The movie commits three major narrative blunders.First, the usual, overwrought framing device, with survivor Nickerson (Gleeson) recounting the disaster and the crew's following ordeal to Melville (Whishaw). Not only the meeting never happened (Nickerson wrote down his memoirs for a minor writer, who never used them); the movie keeps cutting to Nickerson and Melville, dissipating any tension and momentum the survivors' struggle may gather. Imagine a version of Cast Away where, every ten minutes on the island, we cut to a scene of Tom Hanks interviewed by a journalist after returning home.Second problem: characters. The most interesting element of Philbrick's novel is how Captain Pollard (here played by Benjamin Walker), decent but irresolute, is the more sympathetic character, while first mate Chase (Chris Hemsworth), harsh but determined, is the more charismatic. As is typical of blockbusters, the movie chooses a single protagonist (Chase/Hemsworth) and whitewashes him to an absurd extent. He was supposed to become Captain, but was robbed of his rank! (He wasn't - Pollard was the Essex' previous first mate). Chase was popular among the crew! (He wasn't, many feared and disliked him). And so on. Even Walker's supercilious Pollard eventually bows to Thor's superiority. A pity, because Chase would have been FAR more intriguing with his darker edges.Third problem: Howard's penchant for melodrama rears its ugly head. Director and scriptwriters felt the need to spice up this compelling story with inventions (like the whale chasing the crew for weeks after the attack, or a one-harmed sailor warning them about the beast), while omitting details with the flavor of real life (a sailor setting an island on fire out of sheer idiocy, a hunting party aborted after a terrible roar in a jaguar-infested jungle) and crucial mistakes: Pollard wanted to sail to the Society Islands after the disaster, which would probably have saved many lives, but was irresolute enough to be persuaded by his officers to head to South America instead.The result is watchable, but lightweight - the one adjective one would NEVER use for the literary classic the movie so portentously tries to evoke.5,5/10",In the Heart of the Sea
69,Anurag-Shetty,A perfect blend of drama & adventure.,9,14 December 2015,"In the Heart of the Sea tells the true story of the Essex, a whaling ship. In 1820, while first mate Owen Chase(Chris Hemsworth), captain George Pollard(Benjamin Walker) & the rest of the crew were searching for whales in the middle of the ocean, they encounter a gigantic sperm whale. This gigantic whale causes the Essex to sink. Now, it is up to Owen Chase & the rest of his crew to somehow survive the harsh conditions at sea. They will also have to be alert for the return of the whale. The true story of this movie, inspired Herman Melville's(Ben Whishaw) famous novel, Moby Dick. In the Heart of the Sea is a spectacular film. The CGI is perfect & the whales in the movie look extremely realistic & intimidating. The 3D works really well in all the scenes involving the whales & the chaos & destruction set pieces. However, it is unnecessary for the emotional scenes of the movie. Director Ron Howard perfectly captures the suffering of all the crew members of the Essex. He makes sure that the movie is not just about the special effects & adventure but, also adds dramatic set pieces. One flaw of the movie is the lack of character development. Despite everything they go through, you don't genuinely care about the fate of all the characters in the movie. You only care about, Chris Hemsworth's character, Tom Holland's character, Cillian Murphy's character & to a certain extent, Benjamin Walker's character. At the end of the day, this is not a major flaw because, you can't give each & every character a detailed back-story. This would have unnecessarily elongated the duration of the movie. Chris Hemsworth has given the best performance of his career, as Owen Chase. Hemsworth's dramatic weight loss for the film, shows the dedication & hard work he has put in for his role. Benjamin Walker is great as George Pollard. Cillian Murphy is brilliant as Matthew Joy. Brendan Gleeson is good as Tom Nickerson. Ben Whishaw is wonderful as Herman Melville. Tom Holland is outstanding as Thomas Nickerson. Frank Dillane is superb as Owen Coffin. The supporting characters are impressive too. In the Heart of the Sea is a must watch. Go for it!",In the Heart of the Sea
70,rbrb,The Cruel Sea Meets Moby Dick,8,6 December 2015,"This is a high quality sea faring adventure movie, apparently based on a true event. I am glad to highly recommend the film as the whole production is first class and to fully appreciate the picture better to view it at the movie house rather than the likes of DVD. As for example the spectacular ocean scenes are at their best on the big screen.In around 1820 huge profits were available to shipping companies for catching whales mainly for their sperm. One such company had an important whale hunting expedition but for selfish motives employed an inexperienced ship's captain, whilst the second in command ought to have been in charge. That fatal error leads to disastrous consequences. Indeed it was this story which led to the subsequent fictional classic book Moby Dick. The movie for me captures the time period perfectly as the production and design is meticulous even down to the accents and language spoken. I felt I was transported to the 1820's and beyond.An excellent cinema experience! 7 and a half rounded up:8/10.",In the Heart of the Sea
71,spookyrat1,Barracking for the Whales!,6,31 January 2020,"It's a Ron Howard film, so the expectation therefore will be that in the Heart of the Sea will be a very professional production with a strong cast and a good story to tell. On the first and second counts it succeeds, but unfortunately and somewhat surprisingly, the storyline this time around is pretty dull. Unexpected, because the screenplay by Charles Leavitt is based on one of those truth is stranger than fiction stories; in this case, Nathaniel Philbrick's non-fiction book of the same name, about the sinking of the American whaling ship Essex in 1820, an event that inspired the novel Moby-Dick. It follows that much of what we see is the recreated truth behind the world famous Melville tale. Indeed the framing device for the telling of the story is a fictional meeting between Herman Melville and one of the surviving Essex crew members, Thomas Nickerson.In the Heart of the Sea won only mixed critical response and was a commercial flop. I see the main problem being that no matter how good a film, contemporary audiences aren't all that interested in seeing ship loads of whalers going out to kill whales, no matter how adventurous it sounds (especially being set in the early 19th century), nor how good the CGI effects are in playing out the human vs cetaceans battles. Unlike 19th (where the film does reflect the historical importance of whale by-products) and 20th (to an extent) century populations, most of the world is simply over whale-hunting. So we end up with an unbalanced film, where Chris Hemsworth tries to play a somewhat heroic and principled first mate Owen Chase, but at the same time wants to go out and slaughter whales to get a cargo load of oil. It makes for uncomfortable viewing, putting aside the fact that the real life character was unlikely to be anywhere near as charismatic, as portrayed here. You end up well and truly rooting for the ""demon sperm whale"", who causes major calamities for the crew of the Essex, captained by George Pollard, who is played by a far too easily overshadowed Benjamin Walker.There's plenty of drama, including PG - rated cannibulism amidst a narrative that does generally stick to the main historical facts. But the end product is never likely to spark audience reactions to the same extent, that Melville's literary masterpiece and indeed the 1956 Gregory Peck led filmed adaption of Moby Dick did. Oddly the pre-closing credit notes regarding Hemworth's Owen Chase are totally wrong. They claim that he gave up whaling and became a successful merchant sea captain, when he actually remained a whaler for just about all his sea-faring life.",In the Heart of the Sea
72,dave-mcclain,"""In the Heart of the Sea"" is a half-way decent adventure movie which plays too fast and loose with the facts.",3,11 December 2015,"I do my homework. After I see a movie, but before I start writing a review, I research what I just saw. I read summaries of the movie (but no actual reviews), as well as background material, whether it's about the development of the film's concept, the book or TV show from which the movie was adapted, the historical background on which it's based, or some combination thereof. As I went through this routine after seeing ""In the Heart of the Sea"" (PG-13, 2:01), my opinion of the film dropped significantly. As the film ended, I thought about how I liked it, but didn't love it. There was something about it that just didn't sit right. I thought I just needed to sleep on it, but what I really needed to do was read about it. I was distressed to learn that most of what I had just seen in this ostensibly non-fiction film was made-up but I'll have to come back to that. Such a discussion wouldn't make much sense before I talk about the movie's story.Ben Whishaw plays Herman Melville, the man would go on to write the literary classic ""Moby-Dick"". At this point, Melville is a semi-successful author who has heard stories of the sinking of the whaling ship The Essex by a great white whale some 30 years earlier and he wants to write a book about it. Melville travels to Nantucket, Massachusetts to interview Thomas Nickerson, the last surviving member of the Essex's crew. At this point, Nickerson (Brendan Gleeson) is long-retired from life at sea and is running a boarding house with his wife (Michelle Fairley). Nickerson is reluctant to talk about the Essex because of the horrible memories it brings up, but his wife convinces him to talk to Melville – as a way to get past those memories, and because Melville is paying handsomely. And so, Nickerson begins to tell his tale The 14-year-old Thomas Nickerson (Tom Holland) is a cabin boy on The Essex for his first trip out to sea. The leadership of The Essex includes Second Mate Matthew Joy (Cillian Murphy), First Mate Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth) and Captain George Pollard, Jr. (Benjamin Walker, looking like a young Colin Firth). Chase comes from a family of farmers, but has completed several very successful whaling missions, leaving him convinced that he has earned the right to captain The Essex. When the berth goes to Pollard, the son of one of the ship's investors, a conflict between the two men arises and affects the voyage in some significant ways. This film tells its story alternately through the eyes of Chase, and Nickerson, to whom the film occasionally returns as Melville takes notes on everything Nickerson says.After the ship barely survives a squall at sea, the decision is made not to return to Nantucket for repairs, but to continue the voyage. Soon, the crew captures and kills a sperm whale and harvests about 60 barrels of oil from inside the whale's head. The goal is to fill all of the ship's 2,000 barrels over the next year, or two, or three (whatever it takes). After a long stretch without catching any more whales, The Essex rounds South America's Cape Horn and heads out into the Pacific Ocean. Talking with other whalers in a South American port leads Pollard and Nickerson to agree to take the ship farther into the Pacific than whaling ships usually go. They find plenty of whales – and plenty of problems with one of the whales – a white whale, larger than any they had ever seen, and one who seems to have it in for the ship and its crew. The rest of the movie is about the crew's attempts to survive after their encounters with that whale and its devastating effects. Throughout the story, the film blends elements of films like ""The Life of Pi"", ""Jaws"", ""Cast Away"", ""Alive"" and ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"".""In the Heart of the Sea"" has much going for it – and a few things big working against it. The acting is excellent and the characters well-developed. They are brought to life by their back stories and by the filmmakers' extraordinary attention to detail – in dialog, set design, costumes and even make-up. The cinematography, visual effects and editing are also excellent. The story packs in plenty of dramatic and thrilling moments, although I had to wonder about the propriety of making a film which glorifies a practice which has since been banned to protect whales from extinction, but which some countries want to resume. This movie also does a pretty good job of exploring the story's fascinating and little-known historical background, at least to the extent that what we see on the screen actually happened.The movie bills itself as ""based on the incredible true story that inspired Moby-Dick"" and the script is based on Nathaniel Philbrick's award-winning 2000 non-fiction book, but doesn't stay very true to either. The film's entire script is built around an all-night conversation between Melville and Nickerson, but such a conversation never took place in reality and doesn't even appear in the book. Nickerson wrote out his story himself, but it wasn't published until 1984. Also, unlike the book, the movie depicts the whale as something of an underwater stalker and changes several other significant details from the book's version. I understand and support dramatic license. Some of the best ""true story"" movies of the last 20 years have taken some liberties with history, including some by Ron Howard, who directs this film, but in this case, he goes too far. If you want to see a reasonably entertaining semi-historical epic and don't mind being lied to for over two hours, you may enjoy ""In the Heart of the Sea"". I give it a ""C"" (historically offended, but no rhyming pun intended).",In the Heart of the Sea
73,swilliky,This whale movie doesn't quite reach epic proportions.,5,12 December 2015,"Ron Howard's whale epic claims to tell the true story of Moby Dick. Though the film strives to mirror the long, classic tale, many parts come up short. The visuals were extraordinary but the characters and plot behind it felt a bit short.The story begins with Herman Melville, played by Ben Winshaw (the new Q from the James Bond films), trying to pull a story out of Brendan Gleeson elder Tom Nickerson. Michelle Fairly, Catelyn Stark of Game of Thrones, pops up for intermittent cameos as Nickerson's wife. All great actors but the emotion never reaches a true dramatic crescendo that it works towards. The flashback main story goes right to Chris Hemsworth's Owen Chase, a farmer's son who was adopted to become a sea-faring whaler. Hemsworth also gives a solid effort to deliver a powerful first mate performance but like Chase, Hemsworth never seems to take over the film enough. He's great as Thor but it doesn't require too much emotional depth.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",In the Heart of the Sea

76,RussHog,Whale kills humans - awesome!,7,13 November 2019,Surprisingly good film that dramatizes the real events around Moby Dick. The beginning of this film is kinda goofy and the special effects look sorta fake - but once the humans start to kill whales its actually pretty eye opening into how dangerous and awful that industry was back then. When the whale attacks there are some pretty great action scenes as the whale tears the human's boat to shreds by using its body as a battering ram and its tale as a bullwhip. I rooted the the whale the whole movie - and wasn't disappointed.,In the Heart of the Sea

I expect that has more to do with perspective than anything else...People wanted more depth to the story, even though it is a portrayal of a real whaling incident. I spent 20 years on modern warships (okay, mostly oilers and auxillaries), and I can guarantee you that being at sea is absolutely not dramatic, dimensional, or whatever...being at sea 150 years ago was even worse, with utter boredom being relieved only occasionally by some action...This movie tells it like it really was, so lighten up a bit on the negative reviews, this movie is really rather riveting...",In the Heart of the Sea
79,Aylmer,Cliché'd Go-Pro CGI-Whale Fest 2015,5,6 January 2016,"An otherwise quite interesting true story is unfortunately quite muddled by sloppy and cliché-riddled writing. The best scene in the film is of course the central whale attack on the Essex which we all paid to see, but even this scene is ruined by a need to make everything more by-the- numbers and ""cinematic"". Just like how some Tarantino can't resist filming feet or Jess Franco can't resist wasting time with filler footage, an apparently tired filmmaker Ron Howard can't seem to help constantly straying from exploring an amazing story by piling on heaps artificial drama. Let's look at some examples:Chris Hemsworth's character feels overly saintly - he never reveals any flaws at all throughout the movie other than being distant from his family (though by necessity as he's a sailor). He lives a cliché'd life on a bucolic farm with a pregnant wife and full CGI-enhanced view of the bay. Boring.The whales are accomplished 100% using CGI, which look good as still- shots but the movement fluidity gives it away that you're essentially watching a cartoon character. A tremendous opportunity is missed in showing that although only viewed as big fish at the time, cetaceans could reveal themselves to be as vindictive and vengeful as humans can be. The exploitation film ORCA: THE KILLER WHALE handled the concept much better by exploring the inherent disbelief in the human characters impacting their gradually coming to respect their aquatic opponents.For some reason, they introduce a class-based conflict between the captain and First Mate Hemsworth. While they needed some kind of drama prior to the whale attack, this attempt just feels contrived and lifeless, with the incompetent and entitled captain never making any good calls and never ceasing to alienate himself from his crew. He makes William Bligh look like a beloved saint in comparison and makes one wonder why there's never any serious talk of mutiny or murder right from the get-go.The writers also tacked on numerous other whale attacks throughout the crew's adventures, which of course didn't happen. The whale that sank the Essex did not come back and attack the small whale boats weeks after the sinking.Cillian Murphy is wonderful as crewman Joy, but for some reason quite criminally underused. They even opt to leave his character on Henderson rather than stick to the facts and have his character die at sea.The barren island they are stranded on looks nothing like Henderson Island, which today is actually one of the most pristine ecosystems left in the world and quite lush, periodically used as a source of timber by neighboring Pitcairn Island.The cannibalism aspect is very barely touched on and in a very PG-13 way. There's a gritty suicide (in a great dramatic scene that actually sticks to history) but it's undermined by a lot of earlier telegraphing to show that the character is violent and unstable from the start.There's a distracting reliance on go-pro footage all throughout the film, I assume to give us a ""you are there"" sort of experience but instead just distances by turning an aesthetically prestigious survival story into a ""Man vs. Wild""-style reality show.The scenes with Gleeson and Melville make no sense. In 1850 many of the original crew (including the first mate) were still alive but Melville makes it sound like Gleeson is the last one left. The drama with him withholding facts, arguing with his wife, being an alcoholic, and then talking fictitiously about the discovery of oil in the ground at that time just feel like a full-blown celebration of convenient clichés piled on top of a trite foundation.An added on conspiracy theory about covering up the incident just destroys the ending of the film. The captain finally has his change of heart and redemption, but once again at the expense of representing a true story. I would have been much more interested in seeing how the whaling community would have been shook up by the knowledge that whales could sink ships, but instead we missed another opportunity in favor of another boring cliché.This would have been a lot stronger of a film had they just stuck to the facts and not taken every cheap shot imaginable to increase the drama at the expense of realism. In the end, this film's inability to transcend or even match its historic material stems from the filmmakers' sheer cowardice, laziness, and lack of imagination in finding interesting ways of presenting accurate history.",In the Heart of the Sea
80,beresfordjd,Out of its time.,7,10 May 2017,Ron Howard has made many wonderful movies but this is not really one of his best. Who had the idea that the cinema-going public would want to see whales being slaughtered for the oil they could supply in a barbarous way? Of course another drawback is the use of CGI which is almost always obvious. The onboard scenes are brilliantly done but at hardly any point does the viewer have any connection to the captain and crew of The Essex. Yes the film is kind of cold and uninvolving which is unusual in a film directed by Ron Howard. One thing the film does point up is the dreadful life the whalers of the time had. Out at sea for months and sometimes years at a time. Poorly fed and badly treated and always in danger of losing their lives in pursuit of a living.,In the Heart of the Sea
81,MattBrady099,In the Heart of the Sea - Movie review,5,13 December 2015,"Owen Chase: ""Look where we find ourselves. What offense did we give God to upset him so"".In the Heart of the Sea takes place in 1820, a whaling ship out of New England, the Essex, encountered a sperm whale that seemed to have a streak of human vengeance, assailing the ship and stranding the crew out in the ocean for 90 days. The true story was the inspiration for Herman Melville's classic novel, Moby Dick.So I've just seen In the Heart of the Sea and it very disappointing. It was one of my most anticipated movie of December right next to Star wars, The Revenant and The Hateful Eight, but sadly it didn't live up to my expectations as much as I wanted it to. The trailer for the movie completely lied to us just like most trailers today, I mean the whale itself shows ups a couple of times in the movie and we stuck with characters that we don't care about.Ron Howard can be a mix bag sometimes when it comes to his movies. Some are good, some are in the middle and some bad. But I still think he's a great director that can really bring a well crafted and brilliantly directed movie. While I thought Rush (the 2013 film with Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Brühl) was a solid movie, but it's not the type of movie I'll be re watching any time soon, but still I think it's a well directed movie and it showed that Ron Howard still got it when it comes to film making. And here he's still got that unique film making quality in him and I think he did a good job of making the audiences feel really small, and it's not just because of the whale that makes you feel small but the sea itself. But I feel like he really lost himself mid way through the movie, as he really lost it's touch. The directing was good, just not brilliant as I wanted it to be.Chris Hemsworth was really good in this movie and this is the role that he really went for it. If you haven't heard about the shocking weight loss that he did just for the movie and that's what I call dedication right there. The same thing can be said about the rest of the cast. Hemsworth's accent dose go off and on quite often, but overall all the performances from everyone were good.The movie is basically a man vs nature type of movie which is my favorite part of the movie by far.Now for the problems: I did not give a crap about any of these characters and that's a big problem. The characters are so bland, so dull and quite unlikable. Nothing is development with the characters and the only time that I actually cared for them is around the third act. The writers try to make us care for Hemsworth character just by adding in the most cliché thing that any screenwriter can writer to his character and that's having are main hero have a pregnant wife who's at home, so he fights for survival to get back to her, but do the writers know that makes the character more basic, unoriginal and cliché. That's not going to make me automatically like the guy.The visual effect's was another thing that was so disappointing to me, because the effect's were very noticeable at times and it's mostly the CG background. The effect's on the whale looked great but the effects for everything else was pretty bad and quite disappointing, since effect's today should be getting better right now, but then again, I said the same thing about Transformers 4 and Fant4stic.Overall In the Heart of the Sea was very disappointing and it could have easily been great. The characters are dull, the effect's are noticeable, it's slow at times and the cinematography doesn't quite have that epic scope that the movie wants.",In the Heart of the Sea
82,LloydBayer,"Although gorgeously rendered, Heart of the Sea is marooned with little hope of rescue.",5,2 December 2015,"Based on the non-fictional novel of the same name by Nathaniel Philbrick, In the Heart of the Sea is a semi-biographical film that, in theory, has all the makings of an epic action-adventure. Narratively, the film is a layered account of the Essex Tragedy - an 1820 whaling expedition that went horribly wrong. 30 years later it served as the inspiration for Herman Melville's Moby-Dick, a loosely based account of that tragedy that told of a devastating encounter with an enraged sperm whale. Philbrick's adaptation, by director Ron Howard's longtime scripting cohorts Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, is a similar story but with certain alarming accuracies that remained unauthenticated till 1980. The setting is 1820 Nantucket, Massachusetts, where whale oil is a booming business (this was almost a century before crude oil was discovered). Famed whaling ship - the Essex – is commissioned to bring back 2000 barrels of whale oil, with the assurance that first mate Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth) will be promoted to skipper on his next voyage. But even before they set sail, tensions rise between Chase and Captain George Pollard (Benjamin Walker), whose only qualification is his privileged family name. Between ego bashing and bad navigational decisions, disaster strikes when the Essex encounters a mammoth sperm whale with what appears to be a bad case of premediated ferocity. What happens next is history but the aftermath of the attack leads to an unthinkable and horrific revelation that even Melville left out in Moby-Dick. With a pedigree for films where characters struggle against a grandiose backdrop, Howard's In the Heart of the Sea is a dramatic retelling of a classic tale of man versus nature. Or so it seems at first glance. Strategically released close to the upcoming awards season, the film is a visual spectacle worthy of the big screen, but this time, it's not just the characters we find struggling. As a screen adaptation, the film struggles with an identity crisis. At no point are we certain whether this film is an action-adventure about man versus a mythical beast, or a harrowing tale of survival pitting man against nature, or whether it's meant to be a philosophical probe into the darkest recesses of the human soul. What's certain is the somber tone throughout the narrative given the tragic subject matter. Even so, none of the characters are allowed any depth or emotional engagement. Even the whale, labeled by the crew as ""a demon"" isn't remotely terrifying for a creature believed to be inexplicably hostile. Despite these reservations, and to its merit, the film is intricately crafted in visual aesthetics. From the transformation of characters (they were restricted to a 500 calorie daily diet to depict starvation) to the production design, there's plenty of attention to detail. Having previously worked with Howard and Hemsworth in Rush, cinematography from Anthony Dod Mantle is equally breathtaking. At times it feels experimental, but Mantle's camera work is kinetic and gripping with some immersive tracking shots of whales diving deep. It's a pity though that the film itself isn't nearly as ambitious as its source material. For Howard, this film might seem like another fantastic voyage but in reality, it's an endless sea with hardly any heart.",In the Heart of the Sea
83,rooee,That sinking feeling,4,16 December 2015,"For his follow-up to the decent racing drama Rush, Ron Howard has plumped for something part Master & Commander, part Jaws, and part Valhalla Rising. Thanks to the auteur visions of their respective directors, those movies were about more than men stuck on boats together. Sadly, In the Heart of the Sea is closer to The Perfect Storm in terms of its sheer corn-fed hokiness.This is a 2015 film based on a 2000 non-fiction novel, about the sinking of the Nantucket whaling ship the Essex in 1820, which inspired Herman Melville's Moby Dick, published in 1851. The movie frames the story with one of the Essex survivors telling the story to Melville in 1850. It's meta-madness! First Mate Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth) is headhunted to join Captain George Pollard (Benjamin Walker) on the fateful whaler. They're not to return without a hold full o' whale oil. But where are all the pesky whales? The Essex must voyage deeper into uncharted oceans in search of a pod of whales led by a white monster with a penchant for headbutting boats and swatting humans with its tail. Their first encounter is almost ruinous, and then they must find their way home with minimal supplies while the creature stalks them.The script is by Charles ""Seventh Son"" Leavitt and it contains no surprises and precious little rhythm or poetry. Character arcs progress in exactly the way you'd predict from point A to death or redemption.Was Ron Howard the right guy to direct this? He's a high-class hack who has elicited average performances from a mediocre script. The film's title points to something mythic but there's no sense of myth in the actual story on screen – rather, a clunky and corny action-adventure which awkwardly gives way to a tiresomely drifting final act. A key moment of savage desperation is crudely elided, and I wonder if a bolder director may have brought home the horror by showing rather than simply telling.The look of the film has that eerie toy-town greenscreen fuzz last seen extensively in The Hobbit. At times – on land – it can appear painterly. But much of the on-sea action looks like it was shot in a leisure centre swimming pool.Hemsworth is a fine presence with a serious glare, but is he an actor? As drinking water dwindles and desperation sets in, makeup does most of the heavy lifting. He's not helped by the stolid nature of his character. It's the kind of dull role Kevin Costner was often asked to play in his heyday before he went nasty and interesting.The crew is mostly made up of oh-it's-that-guy British character actors. Amongst them is Tom Holland, last seen battered by the sea in 2012's The Impossible, and soon to be Spider-man. But, for all the film's spectacle and bombast, the most affecting scenes are those between Brendan Gleeson, as the survivor, and Ben Wishaw, as Melville. These scenes are subtle and movingly played by actors of consummate skill.To be honest, I wouldn't have minded watching the whole story play out this way, in this little room. Or perhaps just have Brendan Gleeson read Nathaniel Philbrick's book to me and let me picture a better movie in my mind.",In the Heart of the Sea
84,James_De_Bello,6/10,6,5 December 2015,"Whilst it isn't a worthy follow up to ""Rush"", which I deem one of the best pictures in recent years, ""In the Heart of the Sea"" had many elements that remind us why we love Ron Howard's direction in his best movies so much, yet it also reminds us of his faults in his lesser films.First off and most notably: can we please, please stop having useless narration of people remembering events of their youth in true story pictures? There is so much wrong with this technique. Firstly, it is a cheap writing idea, secondly you simply aren't invested in the emotional core of the characters telling and listening to the story, they just don't have much to do for you to get attached, thirdly it breaks the pace a little to many times, and finally it shoves down your throat the emotional beats by the narrator telling you them instead of the story having breathing space to convey the emotions and it is absolutely annoying. This is one of those things that Ron Howard unfortunately trips a lot into, yet thanks to his charming direction he frequently manages to make it light and heartfelt, unfortunately not here.To continue on negatives: weirdly, for only the first hour or so of the film, there are constant shots that feel out of place because of poor CGI. Firstly because CGI smoke already being a terrible idea in any place, is used to overkill, yet still, I lost count of moments where the movie was cutting fast in action or not and it was absorbing, then a shot was out, another three were great and then again another CGI mess. It was stunningly strange and even more so since it lasted for the first two acts only. Which also brings me to another negative point: the last part of the second act and the first part of the third were emotionless. I really don't know what it was because performances and visuals were across the board great, but that whole part just felt off, I got bored and almost fell asleep and then as soon as the part ends I was radiant again. I really don't know what it was, it was just sterile and unengaging for a chuck.The rest was actually quite fascinating. The first hour is totally absorbing. Talking about what Ron Howard does so good, he is a director that really understands giving you a feeling of being there with the characters and this is no different, I felt aboard on the ship with them and through the storms. He knows perfectly well what to show us to get fascinated. Moreover there are some fabulous visuals in the film and really intense action sequences that grab you by the throat and don't let go until you're exhausted. Hemsworth as always shines as the leading man and he is supported by a well chosen cast.Coming from a true Ron Howard fanatic I must admit I was disappointed with the film, there was a lot of buzz surrounding it and I expected to get another ""Rush"", that is probably why I focused so much on the negatives, yet still ""In the Heart of the Sea"" is a good movie and definitely something positive to add to Howard's already amazing resume. Lets just say that I would like to see him tackle again this type of film with big visuals and budget because I would really like to see him excel in this type of movie.",In the Heart of the Sea
85,scottshak_111,A stunning tribute to Melville's Moby Dick,8,12 December 2015,"A poetic and arresting take on one of the deadliest fictional water beasts.Nathaniel Philbrick's In the Heart of the Sea is an entirely different take on Moby Dick, a different vantage that pays tribute to the most beloved tales of all times. The plot begins with Herman Melville played by a bearded Ben Whishaw visiting Nickerson, a survivor of the Whaleship Essex that went down owing to a tragedy that befell the entire crew when they encountered a gigantic sperm whale. Melville is bent on squeezing out the horror from Nickerson's eyes into his leaflets because he believes it to be one of the greatest stories he has ever come across.Philbrick's perspective is exceptional. Ron Howard cashes in on it just fine. He follows the tale with eye threatening close ups and water-shots to jackhammer the dread quotient. Wonderful whale shots have been captured. Essex-sailing, the squall, whale-hunting have been depicted splendidly. It was a joy to watch the beast breathe alive for the first time in the sea. The size of that thing! The satellite shot ensured the audience scaled it amidst puny boats.The better part of the movie runs in a diegesis which has been brilliantly written. The score often moves around the soothing notes of a viola that makes the flick a heartwarming watch. Whales have been subtly shown, never given a proper focus, reflecting – just like you would be bewitched by its swiftness in real life. The beast is a beauty! Tiniest of details on its flank have been manifested subtly. Then there is that bad-ass tail. Watch that beauty surge!What In the Heart of the Sea fails to milk is the ""Chase-Pollard"" rivalry. It had no Rush charm to it. Coffin's role too seemed like a cameo which could have possibly unfurled into a possible brilliant feud. The young Nickerson played by Tom Holland was simply an eye in a tale. His character adds little value to an ongoing stream. Tom is an outstanding actor however he gets lost under the doldrums of their unfortunate tragedy, and often gets overshadowed by the movie's protagonists. Matthew Joy's character seemed like a crucial build; however Murphy wasn't allowed to show off his acting prowess. Flick's editing made sure of that.SPOILERS AHEAD:One of the hardest choices Chase has to make when he finally gets a clean shot on the whale and he chooses not to take it. Whilst the writer leaves that bit for viewer interpretation, it is quite poetic if you really look at it. Chase was convinced they were flung into the jaws of chaos owing to the job they did. He throws the idea to Pollard in one of the finest conversations they had in the entire movie. He starts to believe everything they went through was because they were hunting and killing whales for profit. He takes the sperm whale to be an eye-opener.He looks it in the eye and whilst the world wonders why he doesn't budge, he silently lets the beast go thus saving his crew from another mishap. All those segments have been beautifully depicted by Ron. It is really hard to show such bits via a movie but he nails it anyhow.Also the survival tale reeks of an emotional trauma when the crew resorts to cannibalism. It hasn't been depicted but the words and the diegetic tone are enough to give you an idea. It is a terrible thing to have happened. Howard ensures he keeps things subtle whilst touching such a delicate topic.Charles Leavitt's screenplay is downright gorgeous. There isn't a moment you don't marvel at his beautiful words. They are drenched in literary awesomeness. There are so many points wherein I felt my ears tingle with powerful words.I would highly recommend this movie to everyone. It is a beautiful tribute to Herman Melville and his super-rad legendary creation Moby Dick.",In the Heart of the Sea
86,coreyjdenford,Thar she blows,9,4 January 2016,"This is my review of In the Heart of the Sea spoiler free.Stars: Chris Hemsworth, Cillian Murphy, Brendan Gleeson, Tom Holland and Ben Whishaw.Plot: Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth) sets out on a voyage to get 2000 barrels of whale oil on a whale boat until the unfortunate happens. Now Owen and and the rest of the crew must survive.The story is told to Herman Melville the author of Moby Dick. The film is very atmospheric and literally pulls you in to make you feel like you are really whaling in the 1820s. The true monster of the sea was unleashed greatly in this film in the form of a white whale. The films true meaning isn't about whaling at all it's about survival and how tough whaling really was. The true performance however didn't come from Chris Hemsworth it came from young star Tom Holland who really opened up in this film. This Ron Howard epic should be in the list of his other epics like Rush and Apollo 13. This film is a true must see with epic CGI and an all star cast to put the story together it really brought my soft side because there were I started to get a tear in my eye. I had a whale of a time when I watched this and I truly recommend it 9/10 a must see.",In the Heart of the Sea

89,Figgy66-915-598470,Ron Howard does it again,9,27 December 2015,"27 December 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester This Afternoon - In The heart of The Sea - the events portrayed in this film are the inspiration of the book Moby Dick. Ron Howard has yet again wowed us with an epic tale combining action and adventure with the very sobering human element. Chris Hemsworth, who is both pleasing on the eye and pleasant to the ear leads the cast of men into the watery unknown as they work hard to help him keep his promise of return to his wife and unborn child. These were brave men going to sea on these ships but leaving them to climb into a small boat to take on the largest creatures on earth seems foolhardy to say the least. The amazing special effects leave you wondering if any of the marine life we see are real or are they all CGI, but as wonderful as they look, this film in no way glamorises the whaling industry - in fact it highlights the dangers and hardships these men had to endure to provide the world with oil the only way they knew how at the time. A good story, which led to a classic novel, made into excellent film.",In the Heart of the Sea
90,troyputland,Hard to care for the characters in a film that's actually not all that bad.,6,20 December 2015,"n the Heart of the Sea is supposed to be the true account of the famous white whale we know from the novel Moby Dick. Herman Melville (Wishaw), an amateur writer, seeks out Tom Nickerson (Gleeson) to speak of his voyage at sea with the infamous first mate, Owen Chase (Hemsworth). This adaption is a stylishly contemporary approach. The way it looks, the way it feels makes it available for all, not just a particular audience. Chris Hemsworth's main man is the heart of the sea, making us feel his joy, feel his pain. Others barely make a stand. The sea and the creature it holds are much more interesting to watch than other characters. When things go bad it's hard to care what happens to them. ITHOTS's story unfolds very slowly, its 122 minute running time dragging harder than the feet of a sulking child. The whale's first glimpse comes around the half way mark, and by that point I'd lost interest.",In the Heart of the Sea
91,kermitkid,Snoooooore,6,30 March 2020,"And the award for most inaccurate movie advertising goes to...this movie. From the trailers, I thought this would be a big epic with lots of adventure. What I got instead was one of the most boring movies of 2015. (I know it's 2016 at the time of writing this review, but this film was released in 2015.) I thought Chris Hemsworth would at least be able to save this film, but nope. While his acting isn't terrible, he does have inconsistency in his accents. 1/3 of a sentence will be Austrailain, the next 1/3 will be British, and the last 1/3 will be American. (And not even necessarily in that order.) It's very distracting. I can see why the story of ""Moby Dick"" had to be changed and exaggerated, because no one would stay invested if this was the story that was published. This movie is a huge snoozer.

92,WalkdenEntertainment,Captain THOR Reporting For Duty...,4,10 January 2019,"Set in New England 1820, Chris Hemsworth (best know for Thor) plays Owen Chase, a whale hunter for a career, stud of a husband and of course a soon to be father. In case you didn't know, this film is inspired the great novel Moby-Dick.Owen is the reluctant 2nd in command of a ship (when he was hoping for the position of thy captain) and now takes orders from someone he's never worked with and trusted before. The captain, 2nd in charge (Christ Hemsworth) and crew not only struggle with each other's choices and trust issues, but the crew must also deal with a large Whale which is bigger than anything they have ever seen. The large whale of course enjoys to torment....Having seen the film movie trailers in advance, the trailers really gave me the impression the main focus of this film would be the large whale and big battle at sea when in fact, I feel this film's story is more aimed about the men in the boat.Our film starts with something we've seen far too often. A man who travels far around the world seeking another man's story that only he can tell, the traveller writing it down word for word and will be sure to tell the world. Sigh.You find straight away there is no real reason for these characters from the get go. This does't change as the film goes back and forth as if we were curious about how our story teller is going (face palm). I'll warn you early. The film's pacing is very S L O W and the film's characters are D U L L.The main highlight of the film is the picture and audio. The picture is clean and colour is bright/crisp but the price is you can tell when the green screen is in use- which has been used in huge amounts. When we see a group of men in a boat it's pretty easy to tell what's real and what's fake in every shot.The audio is a winner on bluray with an outstanding and enjoyable effects. The sound of our whale provides many great shakes and rattles as it torments our confused crew members.The film's story I'm shocked to say really disappointed me. We have many characters continuing arguing like children and at times we go in circles and side plots which I feel the movie would have flowed much better without.This film has no re-watch value or new experiences. If you seek a good film set at the sea, I can suggest Master And Commander (Russell Crowe) or of course Captain Jack Sparrow. Savvy?4.4/10

It's a combination of the man vs man and man vs nature type of story. First the captain vs the first mate and then the ships crew vs the giant white godzilla whale that shall not be called Moby Dick (the poster exaggerates a lot, it's about as big as the ship - ca 30 meters). Ron Howard was at the wheel so that guaranties a movie with good production values and cinematography. The film can't be faulted much, it's biggest fault being that it's not exceptional but just good entertainment but nothing more. So I can definitely recommend it, you won't be bored but not blown away either.",In the Heart of the Sea
94,FelipeCarrillo,"""The Whale Isn't The Only Monster Here""",5,17 January 2016,"Ron Howard's new dramatic invention is so confusing and complex that falls short of making a quality product. How it is actually the movie as complete ? Many ways to define this project can be used although it become countless ways. Could be defined as the last work of the enigmatic director, An adaptation of the novel that inspired the classic ""Moby-Dick"". Could be defined as the mix between non- fiction and drama, thing that can't be combined quite right because it loses the center point of the movie which it's fully the drama of a best-seller tragedy. Could be defined as instructive, development was incredibly slow and It seems to teach us that a whale is not just a small animal, it's the God of the seas and for this reason the human beings should not be interested in whale oil or in any of its strong attractants, managing to create a teaching in the global fisheries mind.Could be defined as a story about the survival of a group of brave men (to the style of ""The 33"" they had families and wanted to either go home) led by a macho and wealthy captain George Pollard (Benjamin Walker) it as cliché would not have affinity with the role of Hemsworth (Owen Chase). Finally, Could be described as an opportunity to show the corporate ethics, where the survivors are forced to lie about what happened, fearing that the company does not cover agreed costs. It is not exaggeration, this, manages to capture each of the previous designated items but at the same time fails nothing, What does this mean? The project director was so ambitious that to mix so many elements for achieve an award fell into the void spilling any possibility of a prestigious Academy Award. OK, ""In The Heart Of The Sea"" would be a quaintly dark paint with thinking philosophically of Directors as 'Steven Spielberg' or 'Werner Herzog' but Howard had a completely different view, for this reason it is that so far his best film is 'Apolo 13'. The point of break of all the film is this, wanting to be everything at the same time the film is converted into short-movies separated in sub-genres of a central theme ""A marine attack on a whaling ship"" but the central point of its break is its narrative, having Melville goes to the house to interview, ask and write down what happened that day (Brendan Gleeson in the present-day scenes, Tom Holland as his younger self) for the creation of his successful book that tends to reduce his own writing to transcribe the happened on 1820s, often interrupted for memorable action scenes, for example of this the beautiful work of directing, cinematography and editing at the time of the splendid onslaught of the mammal. Sometimes this could be screenwriter Charles Leavitt's attempt to create a cinematic equivalent to Melville's tendency to interrupt his narratives with with passages and literary events that surprised us to read. As soon as it completes the scene, feels a vacuum feel to see the result of a succession of mistakes and successes to the terrible sub-narrative. Without a doubt it's anachronistic and incoherent, the moment where the whalers if they did well to kill the whale (seriously not, It's 1820 not 2015, Mistake #1) or the bits where the afflicted whalers explain to the young Melville that the whaling industry was so successful and triumphant as today the oil industry (seriously not, Perhaps they sent you a message on Facebook or WhatsApp or you get an e-mail where you explained that a man decided to open a hole in the ground and extract a liquid called ""oil"", It's 1820 not 2015). Okay, it is impossible that contemporary writers unearth their minds of the demons of present and do we immerse in the years 1820 without details of the topicaly, since it is very difficult that the facts of the past surprised for own merit. This is not to say that the old is not lucrative and amazing knowing that some of the best historical movies and TV series shine for its details and pragmatisms of the represented time. Touches that seem to be ironically forced into cinematography - such as the character of Hemsworth, Owen Chase, Owen tries to spear the vengeful whale for the second time but freezes after staring into one of its large and curious pair of eyes, seems foolish here. Are we to believe that a man who has lasted his entire life hunting whales (for a promotion to captain) goes to cow having in his hands his life and the crew??? All is a collusion fully planned, something that water, a good body and a whale may not remedy.If another director took the mandate of the boat and the whole film would have been different. Perhaps wasn't the project itself that failed, considering all the potential to be a wonderful and memorable drama, It was the way and decision by Howard to portray a majestic painting with a brush that no longer serves.Similarly, the film is still acceptable and enjoyable anyway, for its unique photography (Anthony Dod Mantle), the general cast is useful and the magnitude is its production. It should be remembered that much of maritime action has merit thanks to the Essex, and the beautiful and magnificent whale is made by CGI. Something that was pretty real and naturally enjoyable.Unquestionably, ""In The Heart of the Moby-Dick"" should be the title of this film, having been an interesting thriller, a disjointed film, an almost exact copy of the book of auto-help and one look wrong. How would have been this movie with another narrative? Perhaps had come out of the port?

95,dakjets,Almost epic,9,29 April 2016,"Since I did not seen this movie in the cinema, I've looked forward to it coming on DVD. I enjoyed Master and Commander few years ago and was excited about this film as well. Well, I was not disappointed. The film's action around the main character Owen Chase played by Chris Hemsworth is credible and to have him in the lead role in this film was a good choice. He is tough and persuasive, and he is a much better actor than I was aware of. In this film he convinces at least me. The story in the film is about the events aboard the whaling ship Essex in the 1800-century. The story is told through writer Melville, who wrote epic Moby Dick about the story he was told. But the film is much more than Moby Dick. I think some of the best of the film was to see how the relationship between Chase and Captain Pollard evolved. One of the best of the film is character portrayals, who is good and who does not interfere with the dramatic scenes that unfold. This is director Ron Howard's profits, he has previously been shown that a skilled director when it comes to good storytelling. The film has many exciting action scenes, and the effects are very good. Recommended for most people, since it contains both good action and good drama.",In the Heart of the Sea

I don't generally like movies that put false political spins on history. I like Ron Howard personally and professionally but I didn't like this effort. Bad CGI made this even more unwatchable. There are three documented reports about the sinking of the ESSEX and the following epic survival story: One by the captain, one by the first officer, and one by the young cabin boy. I discount the latter as seen through the eyes of a child and with the knowledge & understanding of a child. There were many false representations throughout the movie: The captain was not a bumbling entitlist novice captain and there wasn't a war between the captain and first officer. There were only two crewmen on board when the white whale attacked the ESSEX, the cook and the cabin boy. The white whale only struck the ship twice. The white whale did not follow the crew after the shipwreck. There was not a conspiracy to cover up the incident. And the whale boats were not 'inadequate'. They were well designed and as close to perfect as anything man can make to be functional whale boats.

98,somf,Another Solid Ron Howard Film,7,2 December 2015,"If you don't count his Dan Brown films, it has been a very long time since Ron Howard has made anything less than a solid entertaining film and this is no exception. Based on a true story that inspired Herman Melville's Moby Dick ITHOTS begins with Melville meeting up with the only still surviving member of the Whale Ship Essex, played by the always excellent Brenden Gleeson. Melville pays him to finally describe the events of 30 years earlier when he was a 14 year old crew member on his maiden voyage.I won't go into how it bugged me that using the historical time line. Gleeson could not have yet turned 50, because I am one of only a few geeks who would dwell on that. I think this is Hemsworth's best role if for no other reason he does the DeNiro Raging Bull thing to his body. The characters starve at sea and it is hard to believe that CGI is not heavily involved with his appearance at the end of the film, but from what I have read apparently not. If Howard had made this film a decade ago, Russell Crowe would have had the Hemsworth role as the first mate. But Hemsworth does as well as I could have imagined Crowe in the role, and that is a compliment to his maturing as an actor.A lot of interesting stuff about Whaling and the film is beautifully shot. I have a feeling that fans of the book will be a bit disappointed because it seems that certain aspects of the book were probably glossed over. If you want to see it in IMAX (which was not offered at my screening and which I thought was surprising and disappointing) then you had better catch this opening week. Something tells me that another film opening the following week is apt to hog up all the IMAX screens for a few weeks. I hope that does not hurt the box office for this film too, because it is a big screen epic. My wife would not go with me because she did not want to see the cruelty to the whales, and there are some terrifically filmed and exciting hunting scenes, but I am one of those that kind of rooted for the whales as well. Heck, at the end of the day, one might say the Whale won.",In the Heart of the Sea
99,abouhelier-r,In the Heart of the Sea,7,11 December 2015,"Based on the 1820 event, a whaling ship is preyed upon by a giant whale, stranding its crew at sea for 90 days, thousands of miles from home.Warner Bros release In the Heart of the Sea could take advantage of its 3D showings and lack of strong early-December competition to do a decent opening, before succumbing the following week, to the white whale known as Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Weirdly, I found this film devoid of texture. It took Melville's vision to shape the story of the Essex into an epic meditation on man's capacity for obsession and this Great American Novel that we all know: Moby-Dick. Ron Howard's movie though, is under no such obligation and gives us a devastating story of loss. Call me indifferent but this film is not nearly as deep as the waters in which its characters find themselves stranded. Still you can catch the scent of bigger concepts such as man versus nature, moral of hunting or the cost of oil. Given the weighty themes of Melville's novel, In the Heart of the Sea doesn't have a lot going on behind the outward action. Plus, screenwriters felt the need to remind us again and again that men lust for oil has been a cause of trouble since before we even knew it could come from the ground.This movie pictures a dangerous voyage on behalf of the greedy jerks that sit behind their desk while good men put their neck on the line. Actors are all functional, their persuasive display of weight loss and the scorched-skin make up effects are excellent. This movie is movie star material and Chris Hemsworth is the perfect movie star. However the key rivalry between his character: Owen Chase and Captain George Pollard starring Benjamin Walker, has none of the intensity of Rush's competitive protagonists. This setup is told in flashback. Here, Ben Whishaw plays the author in a frame story occasionally interrupting the action and to be honest, it's not strictly essential. Having captured the world of Formula One racing with such an impressive sens of stylistic adrenaline in Rush, Howard tries to do so similar here and he does a solid job at getting the smell of salt off the page and into the screen. Altogether though, it generates less suspense than Jaws managed 40 years ago with a single Robert Shaw monologue. In fact the first half of the movie works quite well but when the action comes and goes that's when they run into trouble. Don't get me wrong: it's just tat rolling from serious drama to action-adventure and back to drama again can make you seasick. The enormity and danger of the ocean is more than enough drama on its own. The best sequences reside in the second act, with some pretty unique camera angles. Director sends the camera in all directions over the deck of a full size replica of the Essex, aiming to sweep us up in the barely controlled chaos that ensues. The stunt shots that don't include too much whale-watching are all quite thrilling. Finally, the white and grey flecked bodies nearly as long as the 88-foot ship itself, is rendered with impressive CGI. Nevertheless, I believe there is nothing cathartic or even particularly fascinating about the sight of these whalers slowly fading away, or for that matter in the attacking scenes of this majestic and largely defenceless prey. The blood is there, even if I have to admit that the brutality of the whole process feels largely sanitised. Overall In the Heart of the Sea is solid from start to finish. The seafaring adventure is perfectly functional but never really hedge of your seat thrilling. For a story inspired by Moby-Dick it should have reached bigger.",In the Heart of the Sea

It's a Hollywood film in the best sense, full with spectacle, with a huge budget and beautiful faces. But there are some problems too.

101,stephendaxter,'This is not the whale you are looking for.......',6,2 December 2015,"In the Heart of the Sea is an Action/Adventure/Biopic based on the real disaster that inspired Herman Melville's 'Moby-Dick'. The film follows the voyage of the 'Essex', a whaling ship that was bought down in 1820 by a Sperm Whale in the South Pacific, and is a tale of Adventure, Drama, Survival and Boredom. Obviously the main reason I and most other people wanted to go and see this movie was to see this massive whale go toe to toe with the Essex and its crew. Actual confrontations with the whale in this film were few and far between but when they happen, man do they make an impact. This whale was ginormous, he was grand and it was such a spectacle seeing this huge beautiful whale on screen. The way they emphasise his size through juxtaposing him with the boats gives his presence much more weight. Confrontations with the whale were intense and serious edge-of-seat stuff. The CGI effects of this whale were beautiful and incredibly detailed. This would have taken up a huge chunk of the budget as making this whale look as realistic as possible was crucial to the enjoyment of the film. Some of the CGI in the wide shots were well done, but there were still quite a few scenes and wide shots throughout the film, especially in Nantucket that really just didn't look right and did take me out of the film.The film's biggest problem over the entire film was the pacing and the negative effect that had on my overall enjoyment of the film. This was a lot of the time a very slow film, especially at the beginning where the first 20 minutes or so was very dreary and quite boring. Throughout the film there are quite a few uninteresting moments that constantly just make you lose interest. The biggest culprit of these boring sleep inducing moments were the scenes that are showing Thomas Nickerson (Brendan Gleeson) recounting the events of the film to Herman Melville. Scenes like this are nothing new and have been done in countless films before this, but they were just completely uninteresting and didn't really add anything to the actual story of the film. I guess they were trying to get us to care about his character and his younger self for what he endured but for me at least i could have done without those scenes and it would have cut at least 15 minutes of its long 2 hour runtime and the film would have flowed better and quicker. There was one bit of dialogue early on that i thought spoiled how the film was going to end, but it was a very good piece of misdirection by the writers, if it was intentional. Acting wise, the film was pretty good. Chris Hemsworth was the obvious standout, he was able to show off his acting talents quite a few times throughout the film, but still it was nothing amazing. The supporting cast was also mostly pretty strong, Benjamin Walker and our friendly neighbourhood Tom Holland were good, not great, just good strong performances. Ron Howard did a pretty good job directing the film, most of the time he nailed the tone of the film. The dramatic action scenes were filmed and directed in a very frantic and chaotic manner that upped the stakes during those intense moments. Especially in the latter portions of the film he does represent the sad tones and emotion pretty well and handles some very confronting scenes in a way that isn't too disturbing but also isn't sugar-coated. The latter half of the film although not free of some boring moments does pick up significantly from the first half when it introduces some survival elements. It doesn't really end on a high note, it should have been a short and sweet ending but it is dragged out a little longer and just ended up being alright. In the end, this is an Action/Adventure that has its intense, dramatic moments, but is not without some boring moments that if excluded could have kept the film to like 1 hour and 40 minutes and would have made it more enjoyable and impactful. If you are fascinated of the story of Moby-Dick then you will probably get more out of the film than i did but it really wasn't as great as it was meant to be. - 6/10Also this film believe it or not was supposed to release way back in March of 2015, but it was pushed back to December into Awards season to possibly get some Oscar recognition. Should have stayed in March because i'll be genuinely surprised if this even gets nominated for any awards when you consider all of the other great stuff from this year.",In the Heart of the Sea
102,comps-784-38265,Not a Whale of a Time...,5,14 January 2016,"Whats good: The film as a whole is visually really good. I saw it in 3d and it's even more impressive. Good acting throughout, cannot fault any of the actors. Whats bad: Story is not exactly bad, just rather tedious, average, nothing special. When the film finished after 2hrs I felt rather 'let down', is that it? spoiler alert The story starts well, the writer offering a large amount of money to the last living survivor of the Essex, to tell what really happened. The seaman has never spoken of it in decades and retreated to drink with his dark secret. Great so far! what is the story? we want to know? There after instead of catching a 'whale of a story' it's more of a minnow with delusions. In a nutshell. Whaling ship goes to sea and gets sunk by whale.Crew take to open ocean in 3 small boats miles from anywhere.To survive they resort to canabalism. (This is the 'dark secret') Eventually survivors are rescued.(Most of the 2hrs running time is spent for the above)Ship owners don't want survivors to say they were sunk by whale (in case this pushes up insurance premiums - what a dark and sinister ending) However, the Captain and first mate tell the truth anyway. (Which rather contradicts why there was a mystery about the fate of the Essex at the start of the film, i.e. it was stated it 'ran aground and sank' according the court of enquiry)The problem with the film is the story. It has a beginning, and a rather long middle, but no actual satisfying 'ending'. For instance the life of Pi reveals at the end the animals represent people and murder and cannibalism took place. In the heart of the sea, survivors are dying of thirst and starvation. As people die, they eat them, otherwise they too will die. Not very pleasant but understandable. certainly no mystery or great revelations. A straightforward tale of survival in a small boat at sea, not rubbish but nor is it compelling.There a numerous rather dead ends within the films characters eg.. At start of film Hemsworth was promised Captaincy of the Essex. However, ship owners make the member of a rich benefactor family Captain instead.As they first set sail on the voyage, a storm approaches and against Hemsworth's advice, the Captain doesn't shorten sail. Some damage ensues. So the film shows friction and dissent between Captain and first mate. It also suggests Captain is incompetent seaman. But the thread has no bearing in the rest of film so what was the point? Even the white whale is just a rather 'camio' appearance.Summary In nautical terms the film is like a sailing ship with no wind, just drifting this way and that with tides and currents. No steerage, no compass or charts no real direction. The audience drifts along with it, you can enjoy the view, until the ship gently runs aground on the soft sand of 'nothing special beach'. It's a watch once and then sail on.",In the Heart of the Sea

109,deschreiber,spoiled by 2 choices of director,4,21 March 2021,"I was very interested in this film and had high expectations. At first I was pleased. The scenes of the busy docks and on the decks of the ship looked authentic. It might have been enough to carry the movie despite its main character looking like a male model rather than an old whaling hand.But it was pretty much all spoiled by two bad choices.
1.- Most scenes were shot with the camera about 18 inches away from the subject. We lost all perspective of what it was like to be on the ship, of what things would have looked like to the characters. It left me longing for the great views of sailing in Mutiny on the Bounty, both versions of which gave time to magnificent scenes of just the ship.

110,ligonlaw,Fantastic Movie,10,8 January 2016,"""In the Heart of the Sea"" is a wonderful story from beginning to end. It is the back story for the novel ""Moby Dick"" by Herman Melville. Melville, in the beginning of the film, visits Nantucket to interview the only surviving sailor from the doomed ship The Essex. The old salt is played by Brendan Gleeson. Gleeson's character does not want to discuss the disaster even though Melville offers a substantial reward - all the money he has - in exchange for the story. Melville extracts the story like a dentist pulling teeth. It is the story of a massive whale being hunted by the crew of the Essex. Eventually, The Essex is hunted by the large white whale. The world in the 1820s was lit by oil from whales, and we see how dangerous the oil business was in those times, the claustrophobic conditions on the ship, and the great risks taken by the crew.The cinematography is excellent. The story is tight and strong. The acting is excellent. The story reminds me of ""Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World"" which was nominated for 10 Oscars and won six.

Also after watching Master and Commander I'm attracted to old ship movies. The subject of whales attacking ships and boats is also a fun theme for a movie. But this movie just fell flat for me.It took me a while to figure out what didn't work for me. The graphics were good, although there were some CG scenes that I felt could have been better, not the content but the realism of the graphics. I can overlook the few scenes where the CG was not up to par. There were also some whale actions that just didn't look natural to me. The whales did things that I don't believe whales do. In my mind I think even an aggressive whale would still exhibit actions in a normal whale way.The ship, costumes, boats, and other period components were great.I felt some of the acting lacked quality, not enough to ruin the film though.It's easy to see that putting this movie together required a huge effort.The overall story was fine, but I felt there was too much time spent on building up to the ship actually leaving to find whales. Then the scenes regarding the whales felt rushed to me. So in the end it was about the timing of the story board that didn't work for me.I really like Ron Howard as an actor, director, and person. I am immediately drawn to any movie directed by Mr Howard. But I have to say direction was the problem for me in In the Heart of the Sea. It could have been better.",In the Heart of the Sea
113,goolizap,Twizard Rating: 84,8,13 January 2016,"In the Heart of the Sea is approached by audiences as an epic film that faces off a man and a whale. And while that's partially what happens, it's not the whole story.The Ron Howard-directed film is one half good movie, one half less good movie. Fortunately for him, the good half is the latter half, so it's what we are left with. But the first hour of this film drudges along extremely slowly. Taking place in the 1820s, the characters speak in an archaic verbiage, heavy on sailing terms that mostly go over our heads. Sure, it gives the film a more genuine feel, but also provides us with a bit of a snoozer before the action actually starts happening.For those of you who don't know, In the Heart of the Sea is about the real-life story that inspired Herman Melville's famed novel Moby Dick. The film begins in 1850 as Melville (Ben Whishaw) pays an unwanted visit to Thomas Nickerson (Brendan Gleeson), the last surviving crew member of a whaling ship, the Essex, which is said to have been destroyed by a giant whale 30 years prior. Much to Nickerson's protest, he tells the story to Melville about how he was a 14-year-old orphan on this boat, lead by Captain Pollard (Benjamin Walker) and First Mate Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth)--the true protagonist of this film. The strangest thing may be the fact that Nickerson recounts literally all parts of the story, including bits that he wasn't even present for.Some background: Back before humans drilled the earth for oil, they would use whale oil for lighting and electricity. Men would go out to sea for months at a time in order to bring back hundreds or thousands of gallons of oil. In this case, they were at sea for 2 years.The film jumps back and forth between 1850 and 1820 showing multiple character dynamics and relationships--most importantly the one between Chase and Pollard, and between Melville and Nickerson.But the people come to see a film about Moby Dick--the legendary whale who is chased by Captain Ahab--in this case Pollard and Chase. Unfortunately, we don't get to see the whale until an hour into the movie. Before that is a lot of setup, which would have been okay if the setup had been more interesting. 1997's Titanic also features a lot of drama before the action happens, but there's also a lot more tension leading up to it. And this film doesn't have the added benefit of being very charismatic, aside from what the giant whale brings. It takes itself a little too seriously, only giving us maybe two real shards of levity throughout.I understand that In the Heart of the Sea is supposed to be a disaster film, but seeing that the disaster only accounts for a third of the movie, I think they could have afforded to give us a few more laughs here and there.With that said, I was actually pretty moved by this film. I found it's overall messages very poignant and thoughtful. The movie showcases some important themes of animal hunting, prejudice, entitlement, and big business integrity--all of which are still relevant in today's world, and perhaps the most powerful things about this film.The latter part of the film is very memorable and the effects with the whale are incredible. I left the movie satisfied by the second half, but was hoping for a first half that I don't have to skip over when I watch it again.Twizard Rating: 84",In the Heart of the Sea

The effects should have been better as well.A story like this, inherently had the potential to become an unforgettable movie. But it seems as if it, which would have benefited of a deeper study, has been cut away. So did the characters in the adventure are a little flat and the movie does not excite how it should and could have.

116,jeannefrancoise,"In the Heart of the Sea, the new genre movie of adventurous",9,7 December 2015,"Moby Dick, these is not just a title of modern literature, but also a name of a man who wants to travel as far as possible. Moby Dick adventurous story is not just came up by coincidence, but it was created cheerfully by a novelist, Herman Merville. This film, that I suppose to review, tells us about a real story that inspires Herman Merville to write Moby Dick. If the readers could imagine the adventurer time in the film Pirates of the Caribbean, In the Heart of the Sea, gives us more than just a comedy. Speaking about plot, the film started at the house where Herman Merville tried to make confession of an old sailor, the one who still alive from the ship Essex. Later at the film, you would know why he is the one who survives. In the term of cinematography, basically I really appreciate the way of the crew to make the 19th alive again, with the dress, architecture, culture, and also the ship itself. Without a very good special effect, In the Heart of the Sea could not be in the real Sea. As seen on the title, more than 75% of the film will lead you to see the Sea. I also want to give comments about the title that maybe promises you about the whale, seen many times at the film, but the whales are not the main plot of the story. This means the ending also a surprise, maybe the watchers imagine of fighting whales at the first, but this film can give more. You can also understand the connection between government, private companies, judges, and insurance behind the maritime industry at that time. So, whale is just a way of Director to lead people to cover all the story of the failure of searching oils. For me this film is simple, but genius.",In the Heart of the Sea
117,The_Celluloid_Sage,Surprisingly interesting,7,6 April 2020,"This film is based on Philbrick's novel, which chronicles the voyage of the whaling ship Essex, which was destroyed by a giant white whale in eighteen twenty. Herman Melville partially based his famous book Moby Dick off these very same events. In the Heart of the Sea combines these two elements together in a dramatic and action-packed adventure which while historically inaccurate, is still great fun to watch if you do not look for these faults.In eighteen fifty, Herman Melville (Ben Whishaw) has arrived to speak with old Tom Nickerson (a gruff Gleeson), the last surviving member of the Essex, agreeing to pay him a sum of money for his account of the ill-fated Essex's journey and subsequent sinking. Tom is reluctant to recall the events but after persuasion from his wife he agrees to tell Melville everything. Melville is excited to hear the tale first-hand, and is confident that his notes will enable him to succeed the success of his first novel.We then move back in time to just before the Essex sets sail. Owen Chase (Hemsworth) is to be offered the role of first mate. He is not happy about this, previously being promised a captaincy in the past. The captain will be George Pollard (Walker), who's family own the shipping industry in Nantucket. Owen's wife is pregnant and also unhappy, but due to the prospected length of time he will be away at sea, citing that Owen is too much like his father who never saw his child.The Essex sets off on her voyage and we see the crew at work. That evening Pollard does his best to try and get under Owen's skin, thinking himself above Chase. Tensions between the two will quickly escalate as Chase, being the bigger man, leaves for the crews quarters in order to issue commands and positions. It is shortly after this that a storm is spotted approaching the Essex.Now unlike in Moby Dick, which is really about a madman's obsession with catching a particular whale, this title does show what life was like on a whaling ship and the brutality involved. I personally despise whaling and In the Heart of the Sea shows the ugly side of this business, especially over one hundred and fifty years ago. Pretty it certainly isn't. But in the context of the film the scenes needed filming, though thankfully they are kept to a minimum for the squeamish.Along the same theme, the film also questions the ethics of what man does and gets slightly into the philosophic side of things regarding God, men and how significant we really are, or are not. Much has been said about the directing and the use of the CGI but I personally never found any real fault with the effects, and thought the quick shot direction helped to make you feel part of the crew and ship.Featuring some beautiful cinematography, visually this is a very impressive looking feature, the storm scene in particular is very well done. Script and acting are also likewise good as one would expect from this cast. Ultimately though this film was a massive flop at the box office, no doubt hindered by opening a week before The Force Awakens, which really would have killed any films chances of success, regardless of what it was. Whoever set the release date needs a long hard look at themselves.Unless you are well versed with real facts and dates etc regarding the fate of the Essex, this should be an enjoyable title for most people. Even for those people who know the history though, enjoy the film as presented, if you want facts then go and watch a documentary. Solid acting, good direction and epic set pieces make this a good film worth watching, even if it doesn't reach greatness. For that, dig out your copy of Moby Dick.

118,theemuhammede,The giant tale is told,8,26 April 2016,"This was a great platform to share the story of Moby-Dick. It has a slow beginning to it. The character development seemed a bit stretched and it could have been shortened while still delivering the intended story.Owen Chase, played by Chris Hemsworth, was a brave and wise crewman. He was an experienced whale hunter. He kept on receiving broken promises that upon return from his next voyage that he would be captain to follow. He received that opportunity once more, but this time it was official. But he had to be able to return with the oil and other agreed terms.So Chase alongside the other crewmen and Captain Polland, played by Benjamin Walker, set out for this new journey on the England vessel named Essex. But what waited for them in the water was far from what was anticipated and could not have been prepared for. The whale, which was later named Moby-Dick, was of monumental size. It was not any ordinary whale that any experienced whale hunter including Chase could possibly slay. After attempts of killing the massive beast of the sea, the Essex was capsized by a now angered Moby-Dick.The crewmen survive, but it was their journey to follow that would kill them. The crewmen were left astray in the row boats they had. All of their hope was drifting off further into the horizon. If that was not enough for them, Moby-Dick was slowly stalking the crewmen as they drifted on. The hunters now became the hunted.This movie has great suspense to it, and it delivered the tale of Moby-Dick very well.",In the Heart of the Sea
119,joncha,Too much Melville,6,21 August 2020,"A well-told story with exciting thought-provoking plot and interesting characters, and great visual effects. That said, Chris Hemsworth didn't seem right for the role, a bit too magazine-model handsome and with an odd accent. What bothered me about the film, however, was its reliance on the Herman Melville connection, the author's reaching out to Thomas Nickerson, an elderly survivor thirty years after the tragic sinking of the Essex, to get the ""real"" story (an attack by a giant white whale, not grounding on a reef, as reported, caused the ship's destruction). Considering all the dramatic and gory details which the old mariner relates to Melville, when ""Moby Dick"" was finally published, all the author seemed to have borrowed from the Essex is the character of a vengeful white whale, bent on the destruction of whaling ships and their crews. The audience is expected to think, ""Hey, that's where Melville got his idea!"" But in reality, there were several killer white whales that attacked ships during that era and their existence was well known. ""Moby Dick"" contains so much more, much of it gleaned from Melville's own experiences as a crew member aboard a whaling ship, but also from other sources, like the Bible and Shakespeare.",In the Heart of the Sea
120,brutzel,A Sea Story Masterpiece,9,7 April 2016,"This is based upon a true storyIn 1820, the New England Whaling ship The Essex was sunk by a great white whale somewhere off the western side of South America. Herman Melville used this story to write the fictional novel Moby Dick.Herman Melville (Ben Whishaw) interviews a survivor of the Essex to eventually write Moby Dick. The movie states that survivor, Tom Nickerson (Brendan Gleeson) was the only survivor, but as we see near the end of the movie, others also survived. This does not take away from the story by any means. As I watched I couldn't help noticing that this must have been a very tricky, and dangerous movie to capture as accurately and safely as it was done. I know CGI was used, of course, but some of the scenes involved real time and I was amazed at how efficiently all was done especially when the Essex goes into the storm in the beginning of the story and again later when the great white whale comes into play. I almost felt as though I was on that ship and I was looking around for my sea-sickness pills. Kudos to the Director and also to the Editor. This is a masterpiece. I am surprised the movie did not receive any nomination for truly exciting visuals. The acting performances all around were spot on especially from Chris Hemsworth as Owen Chase, the First Mate of the Essex; and from Benjamin Walker as the Essex Captain George Pollard; and from the younger Tom Nickerson played by Tom Holland, who was on the Essex through it all. The interview conversations and facial expressions between Herman Melville and Tom Nickerson were pure gold and we felt privileged to listen to the truth of what happened. I was not aware that Whalers prized Whale Bone Pins as they proudly wore them to show others their experience and prowess. First Mate Chase gives one to a young Tom Nickerson. There is some controversy at the end of the movie as a Board of Inquiry investigates the cause of the sinking as no one believed that a great white whale did the damage. In some ways I am surprised there aren't more stories that talk about great white whales wreaking havoc on ships at sea whether Whalers or not. I mean if there was one as we see in this story, there must have been others. (give it some time) (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Only about 4-GDIs",In the Heart of the Sea

I like the writer aspect of it, I like the modern special effects, but somehow it just doesn't grab you. The theater was nearly empty when we went, so I guess Moby Dick doesn't have a draw. It is an older type of tale and kind of a downer. We all need the uplifting ending, and this film doesn't really have that. Moby Dick is a classic but told in an old way, old story type that was very nicely updated, but I think the tail just didn't click with us as much..... If you are a fan of this classic it is a must.

It's there, but it's just reality and part of a superb tale of how Herman Melville got the idea for his classic American novel, Moby Dick. All parts are acted perfectly, and the casting is professional, too. The filming of the storm scenes and the whale hunts are gripping. The appearance of the great white whale puts Godzilla to shame. I loved every minute of this film, and there was not an instant of regret for seeing it with my free ticket. See it on the big screen before it leaves the movie theaters.

123,taryllsbaker,"""The story of men, and a demon.""",7,31 December 2015,"In The Heart Of The Sea is directed by Ron Howard (Rush, Apollo 13) and stars a towering cast of brilliance; Chris Hemsworth, Cillian Murphy, Benjamin Walker, Tom Holland, Ben Whishaw & Brendan Gleeson. Based on the true story that inspired the great novel Moby-Dick, a crew of brave and strong-willed sailors head out to hunt whales for oil. But before long, they encounter a truly magnificent mammoth-sized whale that pushes their boundaries and violently sinks their ship. In The Heart Of The Sea tells the story of the incredible sacrifice and survival, and the choices that will ultimately save the lives of the fellow crewmen who were once aboard the Essex whaling ship; in explicit detail. Ron Howard is quite hit-and-miss with his directional efforts, but it makes me happy to say that I very much enjoyed this film. Howard's directing is genuine as he effortlessly pulls off some of the best 'Man vs Beast' moments in film history. There are scenes of dramatic despair, survival instinct and major sacrifice as the crew push forward to live or die as men. There are scenes of a graphic nature, more in terms of verbal description rather than visual, but nevertheless, graphical. Howard has crafted a wonderfully shot film, with possibly the best use of grading I've seen in a long time. Using hints of green, yellow and blue all in one to create a rotting sea-like look. This really pulls the atmosphere together. Hemsworth performs skilfully as usual, with some great moments that stand out amongst his other roles. I do believe it's an Oscar-worthy performance, not only for the immense amount of weight he lost for the role, but also the strength and courage he portrays through his character. Tom Holland was greatly discovered back in 2012 with his role in 'The Impossible' and since then has become one of the best young actors in the industry. His performance in this film proves and solidifies that notion, with a very promising career in acting ahead. Cillian Murphy is credited higher than others who had more screen-time than he, but I believe that's a tactic to draw in fans and potentially increase the overall income. The scenes that did involve Murphy were great, though. Brendan Gleeson plays Tom Nickerson, who tells his story to a writer, Herman Melville, who wishes to publish a novel, inspired by these events. Gleeson and Whishaw have some nice chemistry as the story cuts back and fourth between past and present. I believe this way of story-telling works better and helps with understanding slightly more than the usual biopic, or 'inspired tale'.The effects are stunning and very convincing, though I wish that more of the whale was shown. This is personal preference though, and didn't minimise my experience in any way. Although a lot of emotion was visible, I felt it needed a little more strength just to help relate to the characters. This is a hard challenge though, with such a dramatic tale; but I do believe Howard could have strived for a more riveting conclusion for the lead characters. Having said that, I do believe this film will be noticed by the Academy for its stronger moments.Music by Roque Baños is reminiscent of Zimmer, with some string motifs that sound similar to that of 'The Thin Red Line', but this isn't used in the film too much so it isn't too distracting. The original pieces were beautiful and haunting whenever the beast appeared on screen, preparing you for the greatness in both scale and drive. During the scenes with the crew on deck, the music plays dramatically underneath the crashing of waves and the shouting of crewmen. Using percussion and layered string melodies, Baños pulls the music and visuals tightly together. My verdict; In The Heart Of The Sea finally tells us the story of survival in the aftermath of the great sperm whale's attack on the Essex, a whaling ship that inspired Moby-Dick, and does so in full-force. With brilliant and strong performances by all, and some of Howard's best directing, we have ourselves a winner. In The Heart Of The Sea, 7/10.",In the Heart of the Sea

I think approximately two to three months at a time. he hooks up with Capt Pollard and Capt. Pollards cousin.Cillian Murphy seems to be a character that has done this sort of thing before and when we are introduced to him on board the crew...he kind of works as an in between amongst the four folks I just mentioned. One of the more confusing parts of the movie to me, and there were two: was when there were shipwrecked people on an island having conversations when the captain introduces himself kind of vaguely and in general....the other time was when rations were running low and apparently right when one small ship decided to eat their dead black person....the other small ship was drawing straws to shoot themselves with a pistol.FOR WHAT? to eat the dead person? the good news is that this was all given in an account to a reporter or bookwriter almost like the way Interview with a Vampire was filmed.",In the Heart of the Sea
126,Chance_Boudreaux19,Too tame and too fake looking,6,14 February 2021,"This movie overlies on CGI. Yes, I get that there is a lot of CGI needed to showcase the whale but some elements could be done practically. This is a trend that I noticed with old school directors like Howard, Zemeckis, Spielberg and Peter Jackson. They get lazy and just want everything done with special effects. I am a person that is afraid of the ocean and even some cheap shark movies like The Reef can make me feel tense. I was watching Cast Away the other day and that movie made me feel a lot of tension during its ocean scenes. In The Heart of the Sea however doesn't do that at any point. I never felt the tension that I normally get with movies that take place in the ocean as for the most part the ocean didn't look real enough to invoke those feelings in me.As for the plot it's decent although I think the conversation between Melville and Nickerson was totally unnecessary. The plot could've just straight up told the story of the whale destroying the ship without it being a sort of a flashback/story within a story. Moreover, what the film lacks was grit. The story is very harrowing and making the movie PG-13 took away from it's impact. If this movie was rated R it would've been incredibly brutal and would've really made the viewers consider the horrors that these sailors had to endure. I can't see the mass appeal of this movie and as such don't understand why it wasn't made strictly for adults. On the other hand, I have to applaud Howard for working within the confines of a PG-13 rating and including some very agonizing scenes with cuts just at the right time but those moments could've hit home ever harder in an R rated film.It may seem like I didn't enjoy the movie but I did. Chris Hemsworth always makes a movie better through his charisma. The rest of the cast was also good. As fake as some aspects of the movie looked, the whale looked great and I assume most of the CGI work went into making sure that it does. The story is simple but effective and despite its tameness it still made me feel the struggle that the characters faced. There are some really great moments in the film and some rather dull/bad ones but overall it comes together into a coherent whole. I still found plenty of entertainment within this flawed movie but I just wish its full potential was realised which would've happened if it were made for adults and with more emphasis on making the environments feel real through the use of practical effects.",In the Heart of the Sea

I got to know about this when sailors got rich by Whale Vomit selling to Perfume makers. Then I came through this movie and it explained in somewhat detail. It got me emotional too. I got to know that in old days people use to hunt these sperm whales and bag the oil from that to get benefit as candles, lighting up, starting engines with oil etc etc...last Dialogue was awesome...I listened that in Pennsylvania, Man dig the hole in ground and they got oil. How can oil comes from ground?

128,ryanmark-57919,"Great Movie, but it Felt like Something was Missing",8,13 December 2015,"I went into this one with high hopes and while I really enjoyed the film, it felt like they could have done more with it. It's hard to pinpoint exactly what I felt was missing but I couldn't shake the feeling when the movie ended. We do see most of the major characters reach some kind of catharsis so I'm not sure exactly what it is but I'll try to explain it a bit later in my ramblings. It's still an excellent film though and I have to give Ron Howard credit for another solid picture. Let's get to the story.The plot starts with Herman Melville (Ben Whishaw) visiting Tom Nickerson (Brendan Gleeson) to find out more about the events that led to the destruction of a whaling ship called the Essex. Melville wants to use the story for material for his own literary masterpiece, Moby Dick. Nickerson tells the story of how his younger self (Tom Holland) sailed on the Essex and met two men that would be the focus of the plot. Captain Benjamin Walker (George Pollard) and First Mate Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth) were both whale hunters that commanded the crew of the Essex but found out they bit off more than they can chew when a giant white whale destroys the Essex and they're forced to drift for three months in order to get back home.It seems like every major motion picture nowadays has top notch talent involved. I don't know if there are a larger number of decent actors working today or what but this movie is no exception. Hemsworth's Chase is the main focus of the film and he does a pretty good job for the most part. He's able to portray both determination and despair extremely well and he certainly looks the part for a sailor. However, he does seem to have a weakness with the accent. There were some scenes at the beginning of the movie where he tries to put on a different accent but he quickly reverts to his native Australian accent for the rest of the film. He still gives a fine performance though. Everyone else does a great job as well but the ones that stand out to me are Tom Holland, Brendan Gleeson, and Cillian Murphy. I always expect great things from Gleeson and Murphy but Holland is a name that I wasn't too familiar with until I heard he was the new Spider-Man. I thought he gave a pretty good performance and I'm eager to see more of what he can do in future films.The movie is beautiful, which it should be considering most of it takes place on the ocean. The town of Nantucket also looks great although we don't exactly see much of it. One thing about the camera that I noticed was that it kind of swayed and it felt more like we were on the ship with the rest of the crew. It was a nice touch although I feel like some other nautical films pulled off the feeling a little better. Still, they did a great job making it feel like we were at sea with the rest of the crew.How can we not talk about the whales? The whales look pretty good and the giant white whale is downright terrifying. The size and power on display makes you wonder why anyone in their right mind would try to throw a harpoon at that thing. It's also scary just seeing it in the ocean. Speaking of which, the scenes in the actual ocean (as opposed to on it) are excellent and very impressive looking. They obviously excelled with the cgi on this picture. One scene that was gruesome but done very well was when they were cutting up a whale's corpse for oil and others tools. I actually felt bad for Tom Holland on that scene... and the whale.As I said before, it felt like something was missing to me and maybe it's just my imagination but I felt like there was more going on with the character of Chase. We see him display regret or sadness when he kills a whale for the first time in the movie but we don't see anything like that again until the end of the film. It felt like there should have been more to the character and his motivations but we don't get any of that until after the bulk of the movie is over. I don't know, it's hard to explain but I still really enjoyed the film. The characters are all interesting but the movie runs at a fairly brisk pace, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but I guess I expected more time devoted to the characters' motivations. Anyway, the movie is still excellent and I would recommend it to anyone in the mood for a good nautical adventure. God know we don't get many of them.",In the Heart of the Sea
129,ericnottelling,In to the heart of sleep,5,21 December 2015,This was one boring movie. That is pretty much the simplest quickest easiest reviews I can give you about this movie. It's like it moves in slow motion. It's another rehash of a book that has been made into a movie several times each time one more boring and unoriginal then the rest. Why they keep rehashing it I have no idea. The first 30 minutes of the movie can probably be skipped as not much really happens. The last 30 minutes are like pointless dribble. There is a little bit of action from a whale attack and then it's pretty much back to a snooze fest. Like 3 hours of life you will never get back. Hit it up on DVD when you need to fall asleep some night. No special effects can save how boring this movie is. No acting can save how bad the script was.,In the Heart of the Sea

Ron Howard has always been a great director, and I did enjoy a beautiful mind and Apollo 13, but this film has to be one of the greatest of the year. The film is very emotional at times, and the storyline is very well thought out. Definitely deserves an Oscar for best visual effects, and hopefully it will bag some more Oscars on the way.

132,ken558,Soulless and Flat - No Heart,5,4 December 2015,"The movie sets out to imbue one with a sense of ol' seaman adventure and intrigue, but very soon falls into mediocrity with at best borderline competency. The premise holds neither interest nor meaning - you think a scene would lead somewhere, but scene after scene it just leads to ""so what?, who cares?"" territory. Scripting is a huge problem - dialogues are mundane, pretentious and stilted. None of the characters capture any attention as characters. Chris Hemsworth got to count on his good looks and appealing voice to generate interest, and little from the character. Brendan Gleeson's character (his acting is fine) turns out to be just downright pathetic and plain silly, and not the ol' seaman with a woe-so-great gravitas the character was supposed to be. The talents of the likes of Cillian Murphy wasted on another pointless character. Ben Whishaw's character is just childishly idealistic and annoying to boot. Other cookie-cutter characters whisk in and out with no depth nor believable motivation. The premise of many scenes make little sense. Supposed experienced seamen simply lounging in an empty boat with no capabilities of open seas survival is laughable - even our boy from Life of Pi did better. Simply drawing lots as to who will get cannibalized next - huh? And scattering human bones of comrades you ate inside a tiny boat - huh? The whales, especially 'the' whale, should be an important 'character' requiring development - however, it is just made to be a lumbering vengeance seeking bully, a visual tail flipping thingy. Nothing else.The only reason to see this is for Chris Hemsworth good looks and the fact that currently there is no other ol' seaman movie around - so this soulless 'Heart of the Sea"" is both the best and worst there is at Dec 2015.",In the Heart of the Sea
133,tyingling7766,In the Heart of the Sea Review,6,26 March 2017,"In the Heart of the Sea had the potential to be one of the best if not the best movie of the year. I don't know what happened, but it seemed like Little Ronny Howard tried to do new things with his direction. Allow me to explain.Synopsis: In the winter of 1820, the New England whaling ship Essex was assaulted by something no one could believe: a whale of mammoth size and will, and an almost human sense of vengeance. The real-life maritime disaster would inspire Herman Melville's Moby-Dick. But that told only half the story. ""In the Heart of the Sea"" reveals the encounter's harrowing aftermath, as the ship's surviving crew is pushed to their limits and forced to do the unthinkable to stay alive. Braving storms, starvation, panic and despair, the men will call into question their deepest beliefs, from the value of their lives to the morality of their trade, as their captain searches for direction on the open sea and his first mate still seeks to bring the great whale down. Starring: Chris Hemsworth, Cillian Murphy, Benjamin Walker Director: Ron HowardThe three men I posted on the starring line were the three stars of the movie, but there was quite a bit more talent involved in the movie. Enough to the point that should have made the movie great. That's not to say the acting was bad, it wasn't.The thing that made the movie a mild disappointment was the way Ronny directed the movie. For a movie that took place at sea, there was the chance of showing some epic wide shots of the action on the ship. Instead, we got some extreme close-ups that took away from the action.Then there was the CGI of the sea creatures. Someone should have known better to do what they did. The CGI just did not look good at all. There were parts where even the sea looked fake.In truth, I did not know that Moby Dick was based on a somewhat true story. So, telling this story in flashback form was the right choice. And, besides the actors involved, it was the best part of the movie. The tale of survival is a story that will live on forever.Final Thoughts: Needless to say, I was more than a little disappointed in this movie. It could have been a lot better, but we got what we got.Rating: 6 out of 10That's it for me folks. If you would like to continue to follow my post, go ahead and like this page.

135,punishable-by-death,Wasted potential,5,9 December 2015,"I'm not quite sure what to make of Ron Howard's latest effort. It tries so hard to be a big emotional tear-jerker but fails almost constantly. It also has an uneven flow, and while I am sure this is a problem for most book adaptations, this lack of flow or rhythm is due to the fact that the whole movie feels pieced together, skipping over anything like character or interesting banter, among other things. It simply jumps from one part to the next with little to connect them. It is very episodic.What must be talked about though is what the whales looked like. Or more specifically, how well the CGI was used to build them. They looked incredible. In fact, they looked so good that I think the filmmakers spent their entire budget on them, as there are some green screen scenes that look pretty... rushed. This movie's biggest problem though is the lack of anything interesting happening other than whale attacks.Apart from these devastating clashes though, there just isn't enough happening to accompany the action. There is no conflict between characters save for one or two very brief moments, and it is hard to feel for characters if they suffer as we simply don't know them at all. Even Hemworth's main character isn't a man we get to know well; all we learn is that he has a family and his heritage isn't upper-class. That about covers it Sure, it looks great seeing this giant whale loom over the ship, its tail the same length of the boat. And it is great fun watching the whale essentially becoming a villain, following the boat wherever she goes. This is something that should have drawn dread a la Jaws but it somehow didn't at all; these moments are actually damned exciting, and for the most part tense and very well shot (apart from the occasional Hollywood technique of stuffing as many different angles into one scene as possible). Again the reason it doesn't cause dread is because we don't know these people at all. Even though it is total carnage these scenes are a ton of fun and the only real reason to see the movie. Is that the reaction they were going for? The story is told by a survivor, to a man who has heard rumours of the story and is desperate to hear if any of it is true, and if so, to write a great novel. This device of storytelling is done right for the most part, as despite the story being told by a survivor, we are never sure of what will happen next. These scenes also give the character telling the story a personality, one he doesn't possess for the rest of the movie.I shouldn't be disappointed, but I am. There is so much missing; the characters' personalities might as well have been AI-controlled allies while playing Call of Duty, the script isn't much more than shouting naval commands over the sound of splashing water, and Chris Hemsworth is so hilariously miscast it threw me off for the first thirty minutes of the movie. Blackhat was one thing, but this? I found it amusing that the photographers deliberately avoided showing his body, as he looked miraculously healthy compared to his friends. We can't have Thor going on a diet, now can we? In The Heart of The Sea wants to be a heavy drama, but it is closer to a fun filled action flick!

And...Well it is far from meeting my expectations, but it's a good film overall.The ensemble cast is amazing, and give great performances and the story is breathtaking. The screenplay isn't perfect, it could have done something more with the characters, something to make them more complete,and in the end you feel like there's a great beginning and ending but its missing a great middle. It's definitely missing something, the whale for instance, you never feel like there's a satisfying goodbye.But the film is very interesting, and thrilling even if it just contents with being OK, rather than reaching the huge potential of an epic tale like this, that seems rather less epic that it definitely is. But what really fails? The director!How a director like Ron Howard made so many wrong decisions is astonishing. The hue problem i had with the film, is its style. The camera movements for most of the time seem like were made by a drunk running. And then someone just had a huge day of fun, throwing every effect possible to make sure you couldn't see a thing.Most of the time, the scenes are just extremely close ups, or the camera is placed in such weird places you only rarely see a normal shot. Then there's a game of focus and the acknowledgement of the camera, its the sea so they thought it would be a good idea to throw flares all over the screen, splash tons of water to the camera, and manny more effects like this, which makes almost impossible to see a thing, especially in the action scenes.And on top of that the in many scenes it seems like they shot the film right in front of the sun! The shots they think are amazing are actually terrible, and you never get a truly great shot of the whale. There are rare shots that are beautiful, but the cinematography is one of the worst i've seen. There's tons of potential on a tale like this to make haunting visuals, and the action scenes are really great and thrilling, it's such a shame you cant see them properly. There's such a great film under all that visual style.The sound is just perfect, as is the production design and production values overall, there's a very rich world and vistas, the special effects are great, but many times the cinematography just wastes them.

144,mark-durfor,Ron Howard's Moby Dick,6,7 April 2016,"""Call me Ishmael."" It's the opening line of Moby Dick written by Herman Melville in 1851 and is one of the most famous first lines in literary history. It's right up there with ""It was the best of times, it was the worst of times"" from A Tale of Two Cities. Melville's account of events that supposedly took place in New England in 1820 is also hailed as ""the greatest book of the sea ever written"" and ""one of the strangest and most wonderful books in the world"". In the Heart of the Sea is Ron Howard's film that is not an adaptation of the novel by Melville and the infamous Captain Ahab's unhealthy obsession with the great white whale. It is, instead, a film about the actual events that lead the Melville's story. It's about Captain George Pollard, Jr. (Benjamin Walker) and his first mate Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth) about the Essex. The ship was destroyed by a giant sperm whale as chronicled by Chase. The preview looked absolutely incredible. It looked like the the kind of action-packed yet character-driven films that Ron Howard has mastered over the years as he's brought us such incredible movies like Backdraft, Apollo 13, and Cinderella Man. Even his earlier works of Cocoon and Willow are still watched with fondness as stepping stones of ingenuity and story-telling. However, my hesitation came from knowing they could not have filmed this with an actual giant whale. In the Heart of the Sea could very easily have lost its audience with so much of the movie relying on the whale to sell it. At least, that's how it looked from the preview. However, the whale wasn't as much in the story as the preview made it seem.In the early 1800's, it was found that whale oil produced a flame that lasted much longer than other oils previously used. Whalers were paid good money to be gone on long and dangerous expeditions to kill whales and bring back barrels of their oil. Author Herman Melville (Ben Whishaw) heard a story passed down through the years about a monster whale that had taken down several whaling ships and went in search of a first hand account. Reluctantly, Tom Nickerson (Brendan Gleeson), a fourteen year old cabin boy aboard the Essex and one of the few survivors, agreed to tell Melville the story some 30 years after the harrowing experience. The story and the characters were excellent as expected. 95 per cent of the special effects were amazing and flawless. I did notice during the first scene where whales were spotted, the use of a blue screen, but that might just have been because I was looking for it. I also was slightly disappointed in how little the whale was in the movie, but that was because of the expectations set up by the preview. Because of those things, I knocked my original 4.0 star prediction for In the Heart of the Sea down slightly to 3.5 stars. A great Ron Howard film that has a decent chance of making it to my home collection.",In the Heart of the Sea

On top of everything else my favourite actor is in it -Chris Hemsworth.I just couldn't find anything to hold on to - no interesting characters and I found myself wishing it would be over before the expedition even began.I love Master and Commander with Russell Crowe and I thought that if this is even remotely anything like that, I will love it. It was a mistake comparing the two of course, the only thing they have in common is that that everything happens on a ship at sea. This movie really had me thinking about why I like a movie and why I don't and I do think that even with all the action and adventure in the world, if there are no memorable characters it just doesn't do it for me. I want to feel like I want to get to know the characters and be in the movie with them kind of thing.I regret watching this because not only did I not enjoy the movie from an entertainment point of view, but now I feel sad about the whales. Maybe that was the sole purpose of the movie and if that is the case then mission accomplished. But then I would have rather watched a documentary.I don't even know why I am giving this a 5 because I could barely stand watching it until the end. I suppose it gets a 5 because it was a beautiful movie that was dealing with something important from the past.Hemsworth still looks kind of hot though and it upsets me that not even that could save this movie for me.

Bad acting, really bad CGI, and it really doesn't tell the true story of the Essex at all.Chris Helmsworth putting on a Bostonian accent, is worse then Mark Walberg trying NOT to have a Bostonian accent. This movie started bad, continued to be bad, and I left before it ended bad.My advice, don't waste your time on this film, Ron Howard should be ashamed. For the amount of budget this film had, there is no excuse for the bad CGI. I've seen better graphics from a SciFy channel, made to be campy Sharknado style film.I'm sad that Ron Howard has fallen from grace with this one, he's such a great talented film maker, and this is just no where near his caliber.",In the Heart of the Sea

The story did not have to be told in a flashback. They could have shown scenes where the men were too weak to spear a shark that swam close for example, and the scene with the pistol where Coffin shoots himself is not how it happened, and I don't know why it was changed. The inquiry at the end did not serve much purpose. The movie could have also pointed out what happened to the captain later in his life, which is an interesting detail. Overall, this movie was disappointing. If I had not read the book, I may have liked it better.",In the Heart of the Sea
151,brendandevere,A Very Angry Whale.,7,7 December 2015,"'Moby Dick' is the well known adventure of a whaling ship and its crew, relentlessly hunting the legendary white whale that had been a proverbial thorn in any whaling expedition. But before Herman Melville wrote his most famous piece of work in 1850, the American author had received the inspiration for his classic from a real life whaling expedition thirty years prior. The true story of the Essex and its crew reverberated around the world and had the potential to destroy the whale oil industry at a time when the precious commodity was the 'electricity' of the day. Its use in everyday life was common and was the main source of heat and lighting in the nineteenth century. The hunt for the rich oil saw large numbers of whaling ships spending years at a time out at sea so the bright lights of towns and cities could burn before the introduction of electricity. How far we have all come, even from the recent past.Ron Howard has always been a bankable Director. He has been at the helm of some truly delightful films in recent memory and has rarely provided the audience with a bad experience. His solid wisdom has enabled him to deliver a film that is concrete without being spectacular. Charles Leavitt's screenplay shadows that of the direction; it provides the opportunity for deep dialogue without ever pushing the boundaries of its cast, leaving the best performance to a CGI generated whale. Howard has been able to create an authentic nineteenth century atmosphere, with rich scenes full of all the wonderment's of a by-gone era but the film on a whole seems to lack an emotional impact that Herman Melville's story was able to achieve. 'Moby Dick' seemed to have an excitable expectation about it where as 'In the Heart of the Sea' failed to deliver any really memorable moments. This is not to say that Ron Howard's film is not watchable, it just has been unable to conjure up anything new.The narrative focuses on the booming whaling industry out of Nantucket and its heavy reliance on whale oil to provide the energy that society needs to live through their everyday lives. The whaling ship 'Essex' is the pride of the fleet and has been commissioned for a new expedition for the growing need of the priceless liquid. The story is told through the eyes of Thomas Nickerson (Brendan Gleeson), who is the last survivor of the fateful adventure that took place thirty years before. His narration is for the benefit of Herman Melville (Ben Whishaw) who is compelled to write about the story. Nickerson centres his narration around Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth), the second in command of the Essex and a man that was born to be a whale-man. Chase is respected by his crew and is good enough to be the Captain in his own right but lacks the heritage to demand such a post. George Pollard (Benjamin Walker) is given the task of commanding the Essex and it isn't long before his personality clashes with that of Chase.Through heavy storms, potential mutiny and misdirection, the Essex and its crew struggle to make the quota of three thousand barrels of oil needed for a successful voyage. With hope quickly turning to doubt, morale is boosted with a story of infinite whale sighting's a thousand miles from land and the chance for the crew to meet the demands of their employers. once the Essex reaches its location they are confronted by a monster that they have never encountered before; a sperm whale with white markings that is one hundred feet long and full of vengeance. It doesn't take a genius to know what happens next but the aftermath leaves both Pollard and Chase with memories that changes the course of their lives.This is the whales film and the gigantic beast's on screen presence is what the audience wants to see. He makes an absolute mess of the Essex and hauntingly stalks the survivors as they float in small boats in the vastness of the Pacific knowing that they are all at the whale's mercy.Brendan Gleeson is always good to watch and puts in a solid performance as the older Thomas Nickerson. Ben Whishaw is a star of the future and does credit to his role in a safe performance as the famous Melville. Chris Hemsworth is trying to spread his acting wings by expanding his appeal to the powers that be. The big Aussie hunk is doing his best to become a bankable leading man but the jury is still out as to whether he has the screen presence to successfully become the film star that we all want him to be. He can act but I feel at times that he is left behind by more accomplished craftsmen.'In the Heart of the Sea' is a curious film. See it once and enjoy what it has to offer but 'Moby Dick' it ain't. The audience does get an insight into the extremities of an industry that was once the life blood of human civilisation. There is a scene that could be confronting to those viewers with a weak stomach as the Essex crew go about extracting the oil from the harmless beasts of the ocean but luckily this is only seen once although vital in the context of the narrative.",In the Heart of the Sea
152,emilywes56,In the Heart of the Sea but NOT Moby Dick,7,4 June 2017,"It seems there is a misleading here. This movie is not based on the classic book of Moby Dick, but on the book that was published in 2001, called ""In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex"". I really enjoyed the movie, but it has nothing to do with the story of Moby Dick. It is a bit of a fraud to be honest. Someone just published a similar story like Moby Dick with another name and of course not the same context (Moby Dick is superior and one of the best books ever) so that they could present us a movie with happy end, likable characters etc. For me, this dishonor the writer of Moby Dick, Herman Melville. The movie moved me and I really enjoyed this story, I loved how nature is depicted and that for once again humans are greedy creatures that do not respect other beings.

I also appreciated that there was so much more to the story than just the killing of the whale and really about how far a man will go to survive. Even towards the end of the film, the main character portrayed sensitivity and compassion for the whale showing the importance of the connection between man and God's creatures.

So, he started telling his real life story that they went on the ship for the search of whale oil for that they have to kill whale and take out oil from the body. He told that he was boy at that time so they went for search of whale oil and they have to take around 2000barrel back. In one year they only killed one whale and collected 67 barrel of whale oil. They did not able find any whale when they landed in some island then one guy told him that you can find lots of whale near equator and warn them how dangerous are that whales. But they ignored his warning and set sail for hunting whales. After reaching there they find lots of whale there and immediately started hunting at that time one of the big whale attacked and trying to kill them.

155,Ekul1021,Not a bad film in all,7,13 December 2015,"I was drawn into the movie because I'm a history buff, and its always nice to see a film that is ""based on a true story"" and on the big screen. And given this was made by Ron Howard who did extensive research, the movie met my expectation as a historical/entertainment film.In the Heart of the Sea is no exception and nice to see Chris Hemsworth starring in a history based movie rather then the Thor fantasy movie. Also Cillian Murphy from Batman, Tom Holland aka Spiderman, and Brendan Gleeson from a lot of fantasy film.The story is based on the account of the whaling ship the Essex on her voyage to bring some whale oils back to USA. During her final hunt for some whales, the ship was rammed by an unusually large sperm whale that was twenty feet longer then anything recorded. The main ship was badly damaged beyond repair and sank. The crews had to used their small whale boats as life boats and pray that rescue will come. During their course to survive, the survivors resorted to cannibalism until rescued by passing ships. And the story became legend and Moby Dick was born.The cast was actually pretty good. Chris throwing his ""Thor"" command and putting himself in that time period was a good change, Cillian which we all know from Batman and Tom Holland from Spiderman knew their part.The film itself was entertaining and some of the historical main features were kept, some were left out but that is to be expected to keep the flow of the film going. Most history buff may be a little annoyed, but keep in mind this was a full production film and one that wasn't made for the History Channel. However, most of the main theme from the book and Owen and the Cabin boy's account were spot on and just showed the dreadful condition these men had to endure. The one thing I do complain was the whale showed up like some giant monster whereas in the book, whale never showed up again. I would count about 3 scenes which was nice and moving, but historically speaking, never happen. The only thing that DID happen was when the whale after ramming the ship, swam side by side and that was when Owen had the lance but did not throw it. That was exactly what happen and Ron made that scene very powerful and both sad that that whale was defending his people and the real bad guys were the whaling people. Some people ACTUALLY wanted more scenes of the whale, but if you want something like that, go watch a whale monster movie. The film is about extreme survival where decent humans had to throw away their humanity to survive and Ron Howard did a great job in presenting that to us.Now remember for us History buff, the movie does leave out some features in order to keep the show going so don't expect it to be like another docu-drama where they can have many episodes.",In the Heart of the Sea
156,Crystal_Hansen,stop bashing this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,10,1 October 2018,"For never reading the book I found this movie to be quite entertaining. who would've thought that a giant whale could sink a giant ship? After doing a little research on the actual events that inspired the story, I found a few details that were incorrect, that's okay. the movie was pretty great.
Now, for all you people that have been bashing this movie, shut up and listen for a minute. This isn't Moby Dick. It wasn't supposed to be. It's the story of how the Essex sank and the inspiration for the book. Maybe I shouldn't say anything because I've never read the book, but just know that I ENJOYED THAT MOVIE!!!!!!!! 
Now, about the storyline. It was a movie full of twists and turns. The Captain made me angry, but thats okay. I kinda wish he hadn´t survived because he had no idea how to sail a darned ship and therefore, shouldn't have survived because he didn't deserve to. Because of the Captain´s incompetence, the ship was sailed directly into a storm and almost sank more than once. May this be a lesson for anyone who assigns Captains to ships, don't let them be Captain just because their family has a lot of money. It's a recipe for disaster. Find Captains that know what they're doing. If the person has never even sailed a boat, don't let them captain it. What the heck were those people thinking?! They should've let Owen Chase be the captain. He'd sailed before. He knew what he was doing and they wouldn't have sailed into a freaking storm if Chase was the captain. Maybe they would've been at sea longer but at least they wouldn't have been inches from DEATH!!",In the Heart of the Sea
157,ondoin,Terrible,1,11 January 2019,Maybe this movie target group is kids who watch Marvel movies but it's an insult for everyone else. Good cinematography but everything else sucks. The characters look fake and the dialogs are awful. Chris Hemsworth plays this super cool macho guy who walks and talks like a super model with gel on his hair. This should be an epic movie but instead is just a flat film for DVD only release. With all that money the script should have been much better.,In the Heart of the Sea
158,TanQ,Moby Drek,2,22 November 2017,"I'm a sailor and being a sailor I love sailing movies. I also loved Moby Dick, a book that's touching, humorous, thrilling and a deep exploration of the human condition. I was excited to finally get a chance to watch this film, thinking it was an adaptation of that great book. Within the first few lines of dialogue I thought, wait a minute, this writing is terrible. Then I realized this wasn't Moby Dick.The story of the Essex, the whaling ship that inspired Moby Dick, is a harrowing tale of survival. In the Heart of the Sea is not that story. Instead, it's a bland and meandering tale. I don't know how they managed to take a survival story with truly horrifying elements and reduced it to this CGI screensaver but I have some suspicions. Ron Howard should have been my first warning. He's a director that could make the Battle of Stalingrad feel like two hours waiting in a cafeteria line. It's truly appalling. Anyone who's been on a sailboat knows how dynamic the experience can be. They also know how sedate it can feel, as well. Howard focuses on the sedate. He truly has no idea what to do with drama and I can't understand how people keep letting him direct things. Instead of depth and subtlety, we get pedestrian and direct. Another problem is Chris Hemsworth. Hemsworth is the perfect superhero actor. His ability to spout throwaway catchphrases is commendable. His attempts at drama, awkward at best. I would like to think that part of the problem was the script, it's just awful. But better actors have done more with less. Nicholas Cage can turn crap into gold. Hemsworth just looks confused and unsure of himself. He may become a great actor, but I think he'll have to find a direction other than drama. People may defend this film, although I don't know how. I think the biggest flaw was they tried to take a harrowing tale and turn it into a popcorn adventure story. It just doesn't work. When I think of other true stories done far, far better I think of Alive, the 1993 film of a plane crash in the Andes - a gripping tale that gets over the action filled plane crash and focuses on the survivors actions until their rescue. Even Blind Spot. Hitler's Secretary, a documentary where an old woman talks for an hour and a half in a monotone in German was far more gripping than In the Heart of the Sea. Thinking about this, I now think I understand the greatest problem with Howard's film. It tries so hard to give itself some sense of importance by dwelling too much on it's connection with Melville's masterpiece. It forces the whaling aspect of the film while completely missing out on what whaling was all about. I wouldn't be surprised to learn that no one connected with this film had actually read Moby Dick. If they did, they would realize how much of the book is on whaling and why. I'm sure Howard just looked and thought ""Moby Dick is a story about whaling so we have to have whaling stuff."" He completely misses that Moby Dick is a story about revenge and madness but the Essex is a story about survival. So instead of the survival we get this forced connection with Moby Dick. It's dull, rambling and pointless. Skip this movie.",In the Heart of the Sea

161,gloriahur,Nature versus Human in the 19th century,8,6 February 2017,"Based on the true story of the Essex, this movie depicts the physical and mental conditions of the crew very well with magnificent visual effects that are not exaggerated and realistic. The first half of the movie shows the conflict between Chase and Pollard when Pollard, who is not experienced in the whaling business but is from a prestigious family, becomes the captain of the ship instead of Chase, whose dream was to become a captain. Chase actually was promised to get the position this time, but was put off due to his status in the society. This illustrates the social inequality at that time.The second half of the movie becomes much more intense and turns on to the human instinct of survival. Although the action that was shown in the trailer was very brief, the stillness and the emptiness of the sea after the destruction of the ship is emphasized more through the contrast between the scenes. Everything becomes much more depressing and tiring and the image made me feel as if I was also lost in the sea. The fear and the despair of the lost crew is well portrayed through the great acting and the plot doesn't lose focus until the end of the movie. Some scenes of the movie, although realistic, were quite shocking, and the scenes when Chase looked into the whale's eye and didn't kill it, and when someone said that oil was found in the ground lingered in my mind for a while.",In the Heart of the Sea
162,mr-abarton,Enjoyable,7,26 January 2016,"In the Heart of the Sea is a movie that allegedly tells the true story of the whaling ship the Essex and the events that inspired Herman Melville to write the world renown novel......Moby Dick. The screenplay is by Charles Leavitt and direction is provided by Ron Howard.The movie opens with Melville (Ben Whishaw) attempting to get Thomas Nickerson, (Brendan Gleeson), the last survivor of the Essex, to tell his story. Nickerson is reluctant however, and even turns down the offer of money. He finally relents however, when his wife (Michelle Fairely) pleads with him. The movie flashes back to the year 1820, and sees a 14 year old Nickerson, signing up to be cabin boy on the refitted Essex.The owners hire Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth) as first mate, to work under novice captain George Pollard (Benjamin Walker). Chase is disappointed however, as he was expecting a captaincy and finds it difficult to work under Chase. The friction between the two, results in Chase almost sinking the ship, when he orders it sail in to a fierce storm. After a bit of soul searching, they manage to put their differences to one side, to ensure they don't go home empty handed. After making their first kill, several months pass by without even a sighting. The order is given to leave the Atlantic and set sail for the Pacific.They eventually arrive at Ecuador, where they come across a Spanish whaler, who tells them a quite astonishing story.......a story about a huge white Whale. He tells how the beast sank all his boats, then his ship, killing several of his crew.Neither Pollard or Chase believed the story and set sail to the grid reference they were given. They don't have to wait to long, before they make their first sightings, but something feels wrong. The story that they dismissed as a sailors fairy story, comes chillingly true, as they come under attack by a huge white bull sperm Whale.In the Heart of the Sea is an enjoyable seafaring yarn. The script is perhaps not one of the strongest, but you hardly notice, the plentiful action sequences see to that. The Whaling sequences are realistic as is the life on board ship. As for the legend of Moby Dick? You will have to decide for yourself.......Enjoy!",In the Heart of the Sea

164,lanierhunt,A movie to a fault,3,17 February 2016,"""In the Heart of the Sea"" is a movie to a fault. The strings are so visible--and knotted and tangled--that the inherently compelling, tried-and-true theme of man vs. nature--played in its most heightened fashion--fails to make any impression whatsoever. The events of the film center around the oil business of yore and the poor--in both the monetary and sympathetic uses of the word-- crew commissioned to fetch the said oil. The mission goes awry when the ship comes across a ""demon"" of a whale whose idea of an afterlife doesn't include lighting a schoolboy's homework.Chris Hemsworth, the lead of the movie--who seems to have been patched together from the remains of past movie stars--plays a dull character dully; he loves his wife, he's good at his job and his always tries to do the right thing. The always reliable Brendan Gleeson is the catalyst for the story, and he stands there in his imposing, respectable way, and delivers his lines believably enough. The rest of the performances are all relatively on point, but nobody really stands out as being anything but working cogs in a second- rate machine. The big set-piece of the movie--the whale attack--is home to a handful of harrowing shots, and is effectively frightening, particularly the first moment in which the animal's size becomes apparent. However, when it is over, the film fails to build on its foundation, and drifts off into the nether regions of apathy. There is one fun scene where Tom Holland has to enter a whale through its blowhole, but that's as far as it goes.The movie has high, literary ambitions, and yet, other than a brief conversation between two characters, doesn't seem to be reaching for them at all. Its achievements in cinematography are short and sporadic. It can only be described as boring, and best enjoyed in short glances up from washing dishes.",In the Heart of the Sea

The movie was made recently so the effects of the movie are pretty good. The actors that they got for this movie are good. They are good at telling somebody else story. The historical accuracy wasn't that bad. They had to get oil in this time period and it was from whales. There wasn't any other connections to movies that I noticed in this movie. I liked the acting in this movie it made the movie seem more realistic. I liked the scenes where they would hunt the whales. It was a good part when the survivors got back to the main land.

I liked most of his works but this film has little slow paced screenplay in second half. That doesn't matter when the storyline was so good. Story was emotional and at the sametime it was horrifying also. Definitely a standing ovation for the visual effects and ocean cinematography. Among the lead star cast, like the way Chris hemsworth stole our hearts in the movie Rush, same way he did a splendid job as a 19th Century whaler. Even Benjamin walker was also good. Music by Roque banos was just situational and amazing too.Even though the movie has very few odds, it is best viewed on big screen because of its spectacular visual effects.

They come across the biggest whale they have seen and it destroys the boat. They then are left adrift and have to survive. They will do anything to survive. I thought the acting was spot on. They did a good job with the special effectsl. It made it seem like I was actually on the boat. The huge whale looked realistic and the technology used was good. The only thing that made me question the accuarcy was the whale size I thought it was bigger than the movie portrayed. And how they could survive off of nothing. The only connection I have to this movie is the actors. Ive seen most of them before. I liked the actors they picked good people. I liked the story it was well told and very exciting. It was also cool to see they made it alive. I didnt like the beginnng of the movie I felt it dragged on. The movie overall was very good. I thought it was interesting and I would reccomend it.

169,gercs,It was rather ordinary for an extraordinary story.,6,6 December 2015,"What caught my attention at first was the remarkable trailer of this movie (I thought that the cinematography was impressive). With Ron Howard as its director, this film has been one of my most anticipated movies of the year although the only background that I know is that there was this acclaimed novel entitled ""Moby-Dick"" by H. Melville. Well, it was actually based on a non-fiction book by N. Philbrick of the same name, which was published in the year 2000, and was actually an acclaimed book also by winning the U.S. National Book Award for Nonfiction. The background of the movie was indeed ""acclaim-material"".I was specifically expecting some underwater scenes that could bring up something mysterious, something similar to the trailer. Well, it actually started with mystery because Brendan Gleeson's character, the old Thomas Nickerson, seem to have dark secrets about his whale-hunting past. It was during the time when Herman Melville (played by Ben Whishaw) himself was looking for an inspiration for his novel. The movie dedicated most of its time on Nickerson's past, when he was a cabin boy on the sunken whaling ship Essex. It was actually a compelling story, but I think it was told in a rather tedious and unremarkable manner. However, the director succeeded in bringing the immersive experience of the whaling expedition, the details of it which includes going inside the whale's body to get the oil. It was realistically rendered, with some impressive effects, but sadly it was rather turned dull by the so-so screenplay. Chris Hemsworth's Owen Chase, as the First Mate in the expedition, was a compelling performance though.It was a philosophical story, basically grounded on human greed and how Mother Nature responded to it, teaching us some lesson. It sounds ordinary, but with the combination of a good direction and screenplay, one can actually extract something compelling about it. With regard to this film, an unremarkable screenplay rather made it ordinary despite its technical and artistic achievements.",In the Heart of the Sea

I feel Ron Howard did quite a disservice to Chase, Pollard and Coffin. I won't say too much and spoil it for others but he added some situations too.

One doesn't get a sense of the delirium of being stranded a sea for months at a time and they look far too fit to start resorting to poor diet choices.Usually Ron Howard films are pretty decent even if they barely cover expenses. This one falls way off the mark in both areas. OK for an afternoon, with pauses for naps. Don't save it for evening entertainment though.",In the Heart of the Sea
172,Rachel_Dunphey,One of My Favorite Movies,10,29 October 2019,"This movie definitely makes it on my top 10 list. I originally watched this movie because some of my favorite actors (Chris Hemsworth and Tom Holland, I know I'm a basic white girl) were in the movie. I can now easily say that even though they are great as Spider-Man and Thor, this is my favorite work of both actors. They retold a story of these brave sailors in a new and innovative way. The acting is impeccable and when watching interviews with the actors you can see how much dedication was put into making this movie. Having to starve yourself to do justice to a character isn't easy work. I would 100% recommend to anyone who loves a action/adventure movie!",In the Heart of the Sea
173,ericagui,In the heart of the sea,8,24 September 2018,Im watching this movie for my us history through film class. We are writing reviews on movies. The main plot of the movie is about a great white whale attacking a ship. The men go out to kill whale to collect oil. They run into a problem with one of the whales hitting the ship. I noticed that becaus of the time period the movie was made was that the special effects was better. The acting was good as well. The movie had a better picture quality. Nothing made me question its hisotrical accuracy. I know nothing about moby dick. There are no connections I made to other movies. Ive never seen a movie like this before. Three things I liked was the overall story. I liked the actors. I also liked how the movie ended. There wasnt one thing I didnt like.I thought this movie was a good movie. I found it very interesting. I would like to see more actors from this movie. I would watch this again.,In the Heart of the Sea
174,jackfull,"In the ""Art"" of the Sea",9,24 September 2018,"Ron Howard's ""In the Heart of the Sea"" is a great retelling of the story from 1820 that inspired the novel Moby Dick. Please keep in mind that if you watch this movie, it is not telling the direct story of Moby Dick, but merely goes back even further to the actual real life story the novel is based on. For a movie made in 2015, the effects and visuals are pretty solid. There are a few scenes in the ocean where either the framing wasn't quite right or it didn't look real enough. These few shots make the ocean look like nothing but a big Hollywood filming tank with this boat full of old timey dressed men in the middle of it. Other than this, the whole film is excellently well executed. The rivalry between the captain and Mr.Chase is very livid, the experiences of the whole crew are very very real. The visuals, specfically with the water, the whales, and the boats are also extremely well done. There were a couple of times it looked like the water was a bit overdone in either lighting or effects, but otherwise good. The casting for this movie was very good as well. All of the actors seemed to fill their roles well. Chris Hemsworth already has the kind of over commanding, prideful personality in person so to see him in this role was very welcoming. 
All in all, this movie was great. I know it has its rough spots but it pulls on the jeart strings in a few places.",In the Heart of the Sea
175,Blackbird013-1,This movie hits home,8,17 March 2016,"First off, the Essex as well as other whaling incidents inspired Moby Dick, but this movie is inspired by the Essex rather than being a reconceptualization of Moby Dick. It's very important to understand this.I was gravely disappointed that a moment couldn't be spared to explain what the Essex was: a smaller ship re-fitted to try to do a large whaling ship's job. This along with the way the whale hits the ship and the whale following the crew ruined what could have mostly been a historically educational film watched by history students for decades IMHO.That said, I was thrilled to see the story of the Essex being told rather than another Moby dick film disaster which is a book that is rarely understood in modern times for the satire that it was at the time. It tells the story of the hunt, and the disaster that followed making it one of the most realistic sea disaster films I've ever seen. In that period surviving the ship going down was only the beginning of the horrors for so many. This convinces me that this team could handle something as difficult as the story of the Medusa.The Essex looked true to size, and without going into every last gritty and grizzly detail of the disaster this film gave a more true view of the disaster than the book that became so famous.With the mentioned shortcomings I personally believe this is a beautiful film to be proud of. I do think if people watch it with their children they should take the time to look up the Essex and explain the differences and the fictional nod to predatory whale myths but so long as that is done properly I still consider the film close enough to be educational.",In the Heart of the Sea
176,notafanof,Framing Moby Dick,6,7 September 2016,"Obviously it would have been nigh impossible to film a faithful and actually good version of Moby Dick. The book is far too dense, and a faithful adaptation would bore the viewer into a coma. So, Hollywood decided to tell the ""True"" story of Moby Dick- which produces mixed results. There is nothing that is actually bad about this movie, but it is the absence of anything that is above average that ultimately sinks It. In The Heart of The Sea was just average enough that it didn't bore me for too long, and ended relatively quickly to my surprise. The movie never felt longer than it was - which is a plus in my opinion. The movie kept my interest for its running time, so it did actually do its job. The movie is definitely a shell of what it could be though, as characters were not developed enough for me to emotionally invest in any of them. I really don't know why they decided to make the movie a frame narrative. It adds nothing to the movie but filler and a reason as to why the movie isn't actually called Moby Dick. The demon itself isn't in this movie a whole lot, but then again, he didn't appear in the book a whole lot either. I don't think this movie needed to be made. Nobody had asked for it, and it is truly puzzling to me as to why anyone would think it would be a good movie to make. It's very average in the end. 6 out of 10",In the Heart of the Sea

The Essex was a whaling ship that was sunk by a giant whale and one of the survivors told a writer a story that became Moby Dick. The story was well told and very believable. I do not know that much about the Essex but the actor stayed true to the feel of the movie. Compared to actual Moby Dick adaptations this movie is better. Tom Holland plays the kid who does not know what he is doing while Chris Hemsworth plays an experienced whaling sailor. Both do a great job.

Perhaps develop some relationships and then threaten them like the friendship with first mate and Captain OR first mate and boy OR cousin of captain and old friend of first mate... and then mix in some threat to add a little conflict beyond the tidbits they give you (ie., the politics of handing a captaincy to a Name, snore). They could have gone a bit Lord of the Flies as well, to spice it up. Or a YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH! courtroom scene.But alas, no. Just a straightforward story narrated by an old man.

I understand its needed to tell this classic tale, but the studios use of heart warming and epic score to celebrate the killing of whales isn't liked in the modern age. Its the equivalent of making a western film celebrating the death of Native Americans or cheering on a girl being raped.Other than those obvious dislikes, I also found it kinda cut short as far as story telling was involved.

Rather, this film is about the writing behind the novel and elements of the true story upon which the novel was based. If you are expecting a horrifying and gruesome story about a monster whale, you might be a little disappointed as well. This movie focuses on the elements of survival in an unlucky situation after an encounter with a very angry and very large whale, however, the movie does not focus on the whale and there aren't as many appearances by the whale as one might expect from watching the trailer. Overall, the movie is still quite good. It is certainly not what I was expecting but as a writer, I enjoyed it.

CGI was almost there but occasionally looked really amateurish which really detracted from the drama.

Circumstances didn't permit me to see it at the theater, but I watched it later, and I couldn't help but to be grateful that I hadn't shelled out fifteen bucks to watch it on the big screen.I tried to like the movie, I really did, but watching it was so painful that I couldn't even make it more than halfway through the movie. Not even my curiosity over how the story was going to end was enough to make me keep watching it. The two main characters in the story told, Owen Chase and George Pollard, were both, in my opinion, very unlikable characters. Both were fueled by ego and ambition, but there was really nothing that humanized either of them. The entire time, I just kept thinking to myself, ""wow, these guys are both jerks. I haven't got any sympathy for either of them."" And nothing against Chris Hemsworth, but his accent in this was fantastically bad. I cringed every time he spoke. The only characters I felt that were worth watching were Matthew Joy and Tom Nickerson - perhaps that changed as the film went on, but I really couldn't force myself to get past the halfway point in order to find out. I understand that the story was being told over a lengthy period of time, but to me, the way they switched from scene to scene whenever there was a time jump just made the film seem choppy to me.

188,herman-787-132796,"The hard effort to keep the harmony of each issues that really come close as an epic,but still leave me some satisfifaction",7,8 December 2015,"This movie is one of the most i personally anticipated this year.The reason is that my curiosity of what exactly happened to whale ship Essex.The other reason is Ron Howard,he is one of the most highly respected movie director.back in 1980's era i've seen the movie ""Cocoon"" and in 1991 ""Backdraft"". I really impressed by Backdraft cause the way the director describe the fire is like a living persons that breath and ready to burn and destroy everything.That fire also can be a very dangerous weapon.Guess all the moviegoers must remember The Da Vinci Code. The thing that i saw in Backdraft is recurred again in Ron Howard's new movie. Set back in 1820 when the Essex whale ship's voyage must face the deadly assault by a 90 feet sperm whale.This movie stars based the storytelling by Tom Nickerson-the only ex crew of Essex that still alive- to a novel writer Herman Melville.A young novelist that have this ambition to write one of the most spectacular fiction adventure novel ever written. A whale ship that sail under the navigation of Captain Pollard (Benjamin Walker)-a captain by ancestry and off course lack of experience- assist by Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth)1st Class Sailor-who also reluctantly but have no choice but to accept this task by the owner of Essex ship.Takes a very short time for this 2 character involved in psychological war between them.At first Essex managed to catch a whale, but after a few months of traveling, where food stocks thinning finally Chase and Pollard decided to divert the direction of the ship towards the path of tropical waters of the Pacific-after hearing the story of a Ship Captain Spain who survived the attack from 90 feet white whale.However, both Chase and Pollard ignored the warning from the Spanish Captain. A decision based on ambition and greed which then carry Essex into a catastrophe. they only imagine hundreds of whales on display in front of the eyes waiting to be hunted and brought home 2000 gallons of whale oil.And then, Essex was brutally attacked by a whale with a size that was never imagined by them. Essex ship was sinking to the bottom of the Pacific ocean. And crew who survived the attack separated into three boats had to live in the shadow of a very painful death.Stranded in tropical oceans where sunlight stings during daytime as whole body skin burns. In the course to survive, all the crew had to face moral dilemmas by do the abomination or die slowly in pain. Once again Ron Howard managed to do what he's really excel,the whale that destroyed the Essex described not only as a ferocious monster but as a god of the ocean, the whale protectors of human greed. Internal conflicts between cockiness Pollard as the ship's captain and Chase as a seaman 1st class who is an expert in calculating weather and sharper instincts. A little unfortunate that this film only lasted 2 hours which I think is not enough time for Ron Howard to explore the burden of the old Tom Nickerson who have to live for decades with terrible memories. Also not enough time to explore the mental burden of the young novelist Melville (Whisaw). And looks like Ron Howard strive very hard to share a story segment. Even if the film is not a masterpiece but I feel satisfaction in watching this movie. Even if all the actors act well, but it is the whale measured 90 feet that steal the show.Whale is described as being so characterized, the authority that gives lessons so valuable that a knowledge sometimes requires sacrifice so heartbreaking. Ambitions that humans will someday be stopped by the might of the children of nature.",In the Heart of the Sea

The main character Owen (Chris Hemsworth) is very skilled at whale hunting and becomes the first mate of the crew, although, he should have been captain.

Sometimes the green/blue tint seemed a little harsh, but other than that it was good. This was the first movie I've seen that depicts these events so I didn't have a lot to compare it to. I know that there some parts that weren't historically accurate, but it is a Hollywood movie and I'd imagine they spice it up for entertainment value. I didn't really like the time jumping element. Throughout the story, it would cut to an older Thomas recounting the events to Herman Melville. I felt that it took away from the suspense of the main story. It would make you lose interest when you're so invested in the main story line, and it suddenly cuts off to something else for a couple minutes of people just talking. Overall, I enjoyed this movie.

No, I can't say I can make a connection with superheros killing fish in any other movie. I liked how well the actors preformed. The amount of time that i could tell went into the special effects.

Most because it has Tom Holland and Chris Hemsworth in it and those guys are the loves of my life. I liked how they made everything seem realistic. I did get grossed out by them eating raw meat though, that was pretty disgusting. I liked how Hemsworth portrayed such a good leader and knew what had to be done. This movie was really touching and a good watch. I think the whale was my most favorite part because it was so persistent and kept coming back and finding their ship. I loved the part where Hemsworth didn't attack the whale and the whale decided to swim away.",In the Heart of the Sea
206,nichomach,A thoroughly excellent film,9,6 August 2016,"Just bought this on Bluray and watched it this afternoon. My whole family thoroughly enjoyed it. It's beautifully scripted, directed and shot, and with strong performances from all the players. Hemsworth and Walker as the human antagonists are gripping, and the opposing attitudes that they have to nature and man's place in it are a powerful undercurrent. Gleeson and Holland both excel as Nickerson. The action is exciting without being clichéd, or eclipsing the narrative. There may be departures from the literal truth of the story, but I think they're justified. It's one that I think we'll re-watch a lot, and I'm glad we own it.",In the Heart of the Sea
207,paul-3991,Well done story with an interesting positive outcome.,9,28 December 2015,"Extremely good storyline with good acting and great cinematic work. We felt we were right there, back in history to a time when civilization was dependent on whales for oil. While that aspect was a bit distressing to animal lover's like ourselves, the story had some unexpected and surprisingly positive messages by the end for some of the characters and audience alike. Watching characters actually change and grow in a positive way, no matter what they may have done previously, brought a real depth and humanness to them and the story. If you can, see it in 3D, as it helps to immerse you into the action and the experience of being there with the characters. It was actually a very positive story by the end, and much better than we expected and were led to believe. A movie worth seeing at a theater on a big screen!Highly recommend seeing it!",In the Heart of the Sea
208,arcticurse,The Revenant at sea,8,31 October 2020,"This is not a monster film, its mainly about the hardships and survival of the whaling crew.
There's an all-star cast - I was constantly shouting at the screen as I recognised side-characters like Kat Stark from Got, Nick from Fear the walking dead. The acting, cinematography and music are excellent, so I'm surprised this doesn't have a higher rating.
As another reviewer said, the visuals are like an oil painting: The clouds, water lighting are all beautifully shot, and the CGI is excellent.
There's a fair amount of action with the whaling, but most of the film is focused on the characters, which are all brilliantly portrayed by the lead actors. The depictions of nature, isolation and survival really reminded me of The Revenant.
Watch this if you like survival films",In the Heart of the Sea

It's a tale of survival, grudge, jealousy. fear and agony. And the director managed to showcase the glory of Moby Dick and reality of the London oil business in the 1800s.Pros:
1) Story
2) Casting
3) VFX

216,Chxface,Unwatchable,1,29 May 2016,"Movie Review!!Starring the yummy Chris Helmsworth I'm just over 30 minutes in and will already give my review.I read this book, In the Heart of the Sea, the Story of the USS Essex. It was probably one of my favorite books I have ever read. AND!!! It's a true story. Why they don't let us read things like this in school, I'll never know. I would have aced history but I'm getting off track here.It's a story about whaling. These men would kill whales for their blubber which was basically the oil that was used for lamps/lighting. It was essential to the then modern living.Anyway, the book has a lot of information on what goes into prepping for their trips. The selection of the boats, staff (including supernumeraries which are young boys who have, ahem, no essential function or these trips. Women are not allowed here), the food including chickens, etc. the movie has exactly zero of this.I'll cut to the chase because I could write a novella on this.The movie is an expected flop. The CGI is obvious and amateurish. For example, during a major storm, the background is violent but the sailors are still standing on the ship without even holding on to anything. If you've ever been on a boat during even moderate weather, even the most seasoned boater will tell you to always, always hold on to something.The movie doesn't work on a lot of levels. The special effects suck, the acting is horrid (sorry, Chris, it is), and the whole movie is just poorly done. 💩💩Don't waste your time on this %#$* show but I strongly recommend the book. Movie grade: D and I'm being generous Book grade: A+",In the Heart of the Sea

218,SpencerDoingReveiws,Outside of the sea,6,15 October 2018,The heart of the sea is a movie about the creation of the book of Moby dick as it´s the telling about how the sailor survived and how and who V him and led to the creation of Moby dick.As this movie focus on water and the environment of being in the middle of the ocean as how they had to do anteing to survive in the middle of the ocean after have the whale sink the ship as they take the row boat to be in for the next 2 months as this movie does going into what they had to do to survive but it is not that entertaining.,In the Heart of the Sea
219,mosevale-05131,review,5,24 September 2018,This movie i watched in my history through film class and i thought this movie was more entertaining than the other movies we've seen. The story was interesting and I liked how this is tied to the story of Moby Dick. I did think Chris Hemsworth accent was weird because all i could think about was him doing his Thor voice. There were some pretty decent scenes involving the whale as it attack and terrorized the sailors. Some parts were kinda cheesy but i still liked the movie and the actors.,In the Heart of the Sea
220,hyperGermangirl,The Big Whale,10,12 December 2015,"The focus of this show is the big whale, Moby Dick. I was disappointed and hoped if there was a real whale it was whiter and possibly bigger. I hope you don't think I'm bad, but I liked the looks of the whale meat. I'm always looking to eat strange meats, bear, etc.The acting was good, in my opinion. It was way good and out there. They were very mature.I wonder why, I think, Tom Holland had a mole on his chin I know later on in the show. I'm guessing it's real, and it makes me upset and am not sure if he was upset or someone was upset at him and then he got the mole. Hopefully, he has the option to get it removed in a smooth process.The daughter at the end, Phoebe Ann Chase, was probably the most interesting part of the movie.

I think this movie is much more enjoyable then any other movie we have watched so far.The movie is all about how the novel ""Moby Dick"" was written. I'm not sure if the book was actually written this way or if they show it this way to be more entertaining.Most of the movie is a flashback of the youngest crew member of the whaling ship. This makes the movie a little confusing but it' not hard to understand. The young boy, who is no longer young, explains to a writer the events that unfolded upon the Essex whaling ship.I really enjoyed the acting of Mr. Chase, the first mate of the ship. In the movie he was portrayed as a very strong leader and wise individual. He used his knowledge to keep everyone alive and safe during the dangerous events.",In the Heart of the Sea

I liked where it took place and when. Honestly i don't have a single bad thing to say about it. I think how they have the old man telling his story to the writer and what we are seeing is a flashback is a pretty dope concept. It is done in many movies but they pulled it off well in this one. I will say that say that since it is a flashback it confuses you since its showing a different guys life that he would never be able to see as a flashback in certain parts of the movie but you get over that and get lost in the movie. i love the part when they go into the storm i love when they hunt the whales and the part where the big whale destroys there boat and kills some of them . To me this movie really makes you think about what is right and wrong and how things were morally different back in that time period.",In the Heart of the Sea

The writing and plot of the movie felt like it could have been made decades earlier - perhaps by someone like David Lean. But, the digital animation can only be done today - and they really used the digital art to help tell the story. Read Moby Dick many many years ago and although it was a long, demanding read I am glad I read it - worth all the time and effort. The scene's of the men whaling (in the movie, and in the book) are amazing. In my opinion this is one of the best of 2015 - do not understand why it is not being nominated for costumes, make-up, art design, cinematography and editing. So pleased I saw this on the big screen. Good good movie.",In the Heart of the Sea

226,alexczx,"A thoughtful, philosophical movie, beautifully executed",8,12 December 2015,"I'm puzzled by the negative reaction from some viewers and so many critics (well, the latter don't surprise me anymore but I expected better reception from at least the viewers proclaiming to be Ron Howard's fans). This movie is exactly what he intended to be. It is NOT Moby Dick, as some people obviously expected it to be. It is not an adventure story either, although the trailer did it a disservice by implying that it is.There are several lines of personality conflicts in this film that have been covered in other reviews, primarily between Chase and Pollard, class distinction, wealth vs. ability, and so on. What I saw in this film, however, was the age-old ""karma"" thing -- do (or don't) unto others as they do unto you. The whale that destroys the Essex is the metaphorical penance for what the whalers do, and, conversely, it is fairly clear by the end that Chase and his men survive only because he, at the last moment, changes his mind and does not take that last killing shot, letting the whale swim by and away, thus also leaving the boat intact and afloat.It's not a perfect movie. The pace is slow in places; the Nickerson-Melville narrative creates too many interruptions; and some characters feel underdeveloped. But people who watch it attentively and attune themselves to the contexts will find plenty of food for thought -- which is the task of most movies, after all.I saw it in IMAX 3D and I found the visuals and cinematography stunning. If you intend to see this film at all, see it on big screen.",In the Heart of the Sea

Though he does cause calamity for the men, there wasn't enough screen time for my liking.A flaw was the hair. When they are unable to groom themselves their hair grew awful slow and unrealistically.There was a tearjerker at the end which was touching and the cinematography was great with perfect choice of color palette.

The movie is really moving and you will feel the adventure as if you are with them . I really think this movie is underrated and deserves a better rating than a 7. I guess it's the book fans who voted low ratings. I recommend it to everyone who likes adventure because you will fell the adventure here of the incredible journey of the sailors who went to hunt Whales and get oil IN THE HEART OF THE SEA indeed.

We see so few real adventure stories anymore, which take place inthis type of environment and time period. The acting, cinematography, authentic banter - I honestly don't have a single complaint about it. One of the best aspects is that once they are at sea, they stay out to sea. No switching back to land to hear from their whiny families like every other movie does. Imagine if JAWS kept cutting back to the shore constantly once they boarded the Orca.It would have been awful. Ron Howard and Chris Hemsworth did two unbelievable movies together, 'Heart of the Sea' and 'Rush.' No less than a 10 out of 10 rating.",In the Heart of the Sea

It has good production value and tells a compelling story that keeps you watching. It may take some liberties with the historical facts, but is for the most part true to what is known of the real story. The characters are not shallow, but live through plausible emotions. Ron Howard directs his actors, and the whole production with his usual highly competent skills; he may not be a genius of the 7th art, but he will be remembered as an important director of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Overall, I am glad to have seen it and followed up on reading about the historical accounts behind the movie. I was very pleasantly surprised.",In the Heart of the Sea
231,pancolart,Casting done so wrong. The target audience is?,6,17 April 2016,"Casting done so wrong. This might have been a good movie overall. Visuals work, story is bulletproof but three major roles are totally miscast: leading Chase, captain and the youngest boy. The leading role went to the fitness instructor showing zero credibility (face scar doesn't make it) as sea wolf experienced weather forged personality. See past Ahabs like Gregory Peck and Patrick Stewart for reference. You'll say, but this movie is less a fantasy and more real. But if real is lame why bother? And Moby Dick is all about fantasy, greatness, fear, dominance and power of nature. I give something to Chris Hemsworth though, his voice did put me in order to salute. Quite minor Cillian Murphy role gives an insight of the proper casting. And yes, Peaky Blinders fans will be happy to see brothers in action again. I've been thinking is this movie for children? Surely not you will agree on the quasi most disturbing part. But why being soft then on the boy entering whale interior part? That could be cool (well it was), but came out as censored. This was mistake, the ambiguous stance regarding MPAA. Either go all way or make this move for children. But how if the whole premise, tension is that little disturbing secret. I expected and wanted much more of the movie. I gave it 5.51 out of 10.",In the Heart of the Sea
232,ryan-eden-1994,Visually Impressive and Eye Opening,8,21 December 2015,In the Heart of the Sea is a visually impressive and eye opening account of the story that inspired Moby Dick. The film revolves around Tom Nickerson (played by Bredan Gleeson) offering his description of the never previously spoken about events that took place 30 years earlier. In the Heart of the Sea is as much of a survival film as it is a hunting film and the bodily changes that Chris Hemsworth and other crew members display throughout the film is truly remarkable and it is hard to believe that hardly any CGI is used to alter their appearance. The film has impressive visuals and an increasing emotional feel as the sailors grow increasingly desperate throughout the film and do unspeakable things as a result of their desperation. Overall ITHOTS is a solid film by Ron Howard.,In the Heart of the Sea
233,shritanvarma,Beautifully shot and well cast ....A whale of a time...,7,10 December 2015,"SHORT REVIEW- Rating- 3.75/5 3D level - Very goodGoing into this movie one more expect a whale vs sailor action movie after seeing all the to spots and trailers, but surprisingly there isn't much ' Moby Dick' , and in the words of Brendon Gleeson's character, Thomas Nickerson, while narrating the whale story to Melville ( Whishaw) , the story is about two men, Captain George Pollard and the First mate, Owen Chase, who are played by Benjamin Walker and Chris Hemsworth respectively as they command the crew of the Essex in the search for whale oil. As the trailers suggest, they are attacked by a bull sperm whale and are forced to survive under severe circumstances and even resort to cannibalism.The good- The whale action sequences are beautifully shot and the 3D effects surprisingly add to the excitement. The cast is also really good which consists of Chris Hemsworth, Tom Holland, Benjamin Walker, Ben Whishaw, Brendon Gleeson and Cillian Murphy all doing justice to their roles. The entire second act is riveting and I actually cared when someone died on board unlike in any ' Pirates of the Caribbean' movie. Chris Hemsworth and Tom Holland also stand out.The bad- Not enough Moby Dick in the movie. The whale only appears during the second act and has a brief appearance in the third act and is the film's Godzilla. Benjamin Walker also deserved a much larger role and he is not allowed to shine in the presence of Chris Hemsworth. Also, even though the action was riveting, these scenes lack those blockbuster moments which stick with you even after the movie and ultimately leaves the action a bit forgettable.Verdict- I have a strong feeling you will like is one if you enjoyed movies like Godzilla where the monster has less screen presence and still enjoy movies like Life of Pi and cast away",In the Heart of the Sea

I was excited when the giant whale came in to save the day but then just wished it would go away when it kept bothering the already ship-wrecked people. It was very disturbing when they had to eat a person, and then pulled sticks to see who would be killed and eaten next.

237,dirtyjabs,I loved it,9,11 October 2018,We are writing reviews on movies. The main plot of the movie is about a great white whale attacking a ship. The men go out to kill whale to collect oil. They run into a problem with one of the whales hitting the ship. I noticed that becaus of the time period the movie was made was that the special effects was better. The acting was good as well. The movie had a better picture quality. Nothing made me question its hisotrical accuracy. I know nothing about moby dick. There are no connections I made to other movies. Ive never seen a movie like this before. Three things I liked was the overall story. I liked the actors. I also liked how the movie ended. There wasnt one thing I didnt like.I thought this movie was a good movie. I found it very interesting. I would like to see more actors from this movie. I would watch this again.,In the Heart of the Sea
238,testudinidae,"Flawed, but nonetheless a good yarn.",7,17 May 2020,"After reading several reviews here, a few things stand out about this film. The most glaring, is Hemsworth's own performance, which was described as ""underdeveloped "" by a few, and I must agree. The off again, on again New English accent, the lack of development of his family life, and his relationship with Captain Pollard not being anywhere near the level of personal conflict that made ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" and every one of it's remakes so entertaining. This is curious, because so much time was spent on Herman Melville's request of the seaman who saw it all.
The omission of seafaring shanties was a real disappointment. Even the original ""Moby Dick,"" with Gregory Peck had a few, and they certainly lent a sense of realism to what you are watching, not to mention that many shanties were catchy songs.
I found Cillian Murphy's character woefully underused, in just about every way. He may as well not have been in the film. His presence didn't add anything.
The idea of cannibalism is, and has historically been, something that is so abhorrent, no one who commits it, can ever escape it's shame. That both Hemsworth's character and Captain Pollard, in particular, escaped it, detracted somewhat to the film, but the one thing I absolutely laud this film for, is it's defense of ethics, morals and honor. Both captain and First Mate held true to those principles, regardless of the consequences, but at the end of the film, stand head and shoulders above everyone in Nantucket.It's actually a good morality tale to be told, in this time, the time of Covid 19, and 21st century's worthless politicians who, like the slimebag businessmen in Nantucket, care of nothing for anything or anyone, but profit, even over the things that define them as human beings. If not for the previous list of flaws, this film might have gotten eight or nine stars.",In the Heart of the Sea
239,ankurjha7,The story behind the story of the great white whale !!!,7,10 May 2019,"As amply stated by reviewers before me - this is no Moby Dick and if you were expecting it to be like that you are bound to be disappointed . However,if you manage to avert the bias on account of this being connected to the classic , you will find it to be quite enjoyable . With breathtaking visuals , apt direction and a matching cinematography , the movie manages to put you in the Essex (well , to a great extent actually ) and let you feel both the excitement and the horrors of a whaler in 1800s.
However , since this is the story which inspired the tale of Moby Dick comparisons are bound to be made . Of course , the movie lacks the traits of becoming a classic like novel. It lacked the depth of the characters as penned down so eloquently by Herman Melville but then Melville had the liberty to fictionalize and to contour the novel in its final shape using his brilliant imagination. Ron Howard unfortunately had just reality to work with. And yet despite the lack of intensity we find in Moby Dick, the storytelling was quite good and the performances equally praiseworthy . It is movies like this and Rush which make me believe that soon we might have an awesome actor in Chris Hemsworth.All in all the movie is definitely an above average , far from what many negative reviews are letting you believe . Give it a chance . It is more than likely that you won't regret it.",In the Heart of the Sea

I liked how nature is a part of the movie and how the humans are pretty selfish for what they have, and don't seem to take anything from anything. The movie still kinda is a movie that was made for money to me, I feel like this movie was a quick summary of the important parts and wasn't and actual representation of nature and man.

246,TheWanderingBohemian,Holy Cow!! That is a Huge Whale.,7,2 January 2016,"Inspired by Herman Melville's Moby-Dick, In the Heart of the Sea, will make you go, ""Holy Cow!!, that's a huge Whale"". The movie begins in 1820, but I think its concerns are contemporary – the damage to whaling habitats caused by hunting expeditions, humankind's dependence on oil, and nature's revenge at human intervention. The real battle is between the men and a vengeful whale whose obsessive assaults on the ship provide the film with its most spectacular and powerful moments. The special effects team kicks into gear once the Essex enters the water. The battle between the whale and the humans has the unfortunate effect of creating empathy for the mammal, which appears rightfully outraged at the repeated attacks on members of its clan. After the damage has been done, the story floats just like the castaways, counting days to the inevitable return home. The old-fashioned man-versus-nature yarn is the best thing about In the Heart of the Sea. The cast performs efficiently, but they are dwarfed in every way possible by Moby Dick's inspiration. The movie has its several highs and some lows but looking at the grand picture it makes a pretty decent watch.In a nutshell, 'In the Heart of the Sea' will have you rooting for the whale and the mammal wins the contest in Ron Howard's drama.",In the Heart of the Sea
247,debrakessing,bad accents & big fish,6,22 December 2015,"I don't have much to say about the film. It is entertaining in parts, certainly not awful & it features some of the very best actors working today.Unfortunately, it features them forced to speak in accents other than their own and man, there's some bad ones. I am aware of how many actors play other nationalities and do it extremely well. However, in this American set movie (Pennsylvania, which has a very distinctive accent) the leading man is Australian (his accent is the worst, I love Greater Hemsworth but he does Asgardian way better!!)the Captain is apparently American, but every single other main role is played by Irish greats (Brendan Gleeson, Cillian Murphy) & English (Ben Whishaw is one of the best young actors around) ALL the rest of the cast I can remember speaking are English. I know it sounds like me ranting about nothing, but when an entire cast (minus 1) is not speaking in their natural voice it is very noticeable. When the necessary dialect is so specific, it is even more noticeable. Were there NO good American actors available??Usually one or two slightly slipping accents in a cast is nothing and does not effect the movie. When the whole cast doesn't know what they sound like, it does. Ron Howard is so experienced I can't believe he did this.",In the Heart of the Sea

First there was a real Sperm Whale that was very large and had attacked whalers. The Ron Howard film and the entire cast does a very believable account and very admirable view of that time and it simply is a gem in terms of historical perspective, accuracy of depicting whaling, whale oils place in commerce, and indeed man's role in the universe. I myself am a fisheries and water expert and have looked into early commercial fishing and whaling, and think the movie is uncannily perfect in almost every way. Those who rate this film lower are not experts on the whaling industry, or commerce at the time. In the Heart of The Sea should actually be given great applause for authenticity and warmth and depth of it's whale and human condition. Do,see this great movie.

250,climbingmoss,Not Jonah and the Whale! It would have been better if it were!,6,10 March 2016,"Chris Hemsworth plays Owen Chase a whaler on the whaling ship Essex, that was sunk in 1820 after chasing and trying to kill a whale of monstrous proportions . The story is retold by the only surviver of the shipwreck Thomas Nickerson (Brendan Gleeson) many years later, to a writer named Herman Melville. The film tells more than the book that Melville would eventually write, but it is long and drawn out, much as Moby Dick is in the reading. Here is what we thought of it from both our perspectives.HER: I went into this film thinking that it was about a man that gets swallowed by a giant whale and lives inside it, eventually being spat out some time later. You can understand my disappointment when I asked HIM ""When does he get swallowed by the whale then?"" He just glared at me and eventually explained. That being said, it was OK, I just don't remember very much of it, as it was long and slow. My mind did wander a fair bit, wandering how long it took to film and what was the time scale of this adventure, it's not too clear.HIM: I knew what to expect - as far as it was Moby Dick and not Jonah and the Whale! I thought it was just a straight telling, rather than a adaptation, but that said it was easier to watch than reading the book (I struggled and eventually quit Moby Dick halfway through). The cinematography was good, but the CGI still ruined too much of it for me, gone are the good old days where an entire crew lived on rafts and boats in the middle of the Atlantic for months at a time to get the shots needed and it shows, this film dragged and didn't have the tension or drama it so rightly needed to portray such a determined and dramatic story. I may had nodded off or I simply blanked out midway through as it just went on too long (much like this review is doing). But I've seen it, but won't be watching it again, once was enough, but it is worth the one viewing.",In the Heart of the Sea

Facts are set aside to produce a stand off between an unintelligible Chris Hemsworth (was he drinking?) and Benjamin Walker, as the first mate and Captain. There's decent CGI, and music to tell you what to feel. Brendan Gleeson, Ben Whislaw and Michelle Fairley give good performances as do some other members of the cast, but there's hardly a fact which isn't distorted and the actual weeks of misery these people suffered on the sea are compressed into two brief longshot pastels of the ocean, with narration.

The work of story building is very well. The second half is like 'life of pie'. And the white whale character is not bad as mentioned before its' appearance. End is making movie off. It means that the lack of the flavor of adventure in the end. Allover it is an entertaining film throughout the length besides its' end.

The time and the survivor in those boats for so so many days... the non sense ideas of the captain in the beginning... the whale following them for thousands and thousands of miles in the sea.

This unfortunately falls short, hell, it didn't even leave the stables. Lack of character building being the major downfall. A film not entirely centred on 'Moby', it must rely on characters that have no meaning, Helmsworth having his Wife and unborn child is a lame attempt to endear viewers to essentially to a man and woman who already know that he may not know if he will come home again after years at sea. And his off on relationship with Captain Pollard is childish at times and underwritten.

And it definitely was. It got my heart pumping and made me cry out once or twice during the storm scenes when the ship was being thrown around. I liked the cabin boy (thomas) quite a bit and was even sympathetic towards the Captain who knew he wasn't doing his best at times but determined to prove himself. Chris Hemsworth is a very heroic actor and so he plays that part of the character well but there were two scenes (when saying goodbye to his friends and then when he thought he saw his father) when he came off a little too wooden and sounded awkward. But besides that he held up and I was swooning quite a bit at his looks. I cried when the first whale was killed and gagging when Thomas went into the whale carcass for more oil. With that said I feel like the second half dragged and while I want to watch it again maybe later today I'll probably only watch the first half and then skip the second. Bravo for the diversity as well. There were two black characters on the ship and only one died!

Almost jarring in its realistic portrayal of mid-1800's people and attitudes, warts and all. I loved being taken out of my movie rut.While munching my popcorn, I felt I was on board the tall-masted sailing ship, dodging the lines, ducking the booms, grabbing the rails to stay on board during heavy seas, the salt water crashing over everything. Just taken in completely. At age 50+ I actually jumped at the scary parts.This movie is everything a movie should be. Beautiful cinematography. Great casting, directing, acting, staging, costuming, special effects. The 1820's coastal town (created by special effects) looked real. The re-creation of how life was and how people of the time spoke and behaved was superb - and jarring. We tend today to think we're superior to past generations, by comparison we're just soft.The script tells a true story and Ron Howard is a wonderful storyteller.

The others weren't much better.The script was beyond amateurish. The conflict between first mate and captain was artificial and manufactured, illogical and irrational. The injected political correctness was annoying. Let's get this straight. No one at the time thought killing whales was bad. Why should they?

The actual true story is so incredibly riveting, that nothing had to be done, but put it up on the silver screen for all to behold. There was no love story. There was no blue-blood vs. working man conflict. The captain of the ship in reality had paid his dues and earned his position....a position on an old, beat-up vessel. What about the story of torching the Galapagos islands after collecting three Galapagos islands tortoises...there's a story within a story, and a good one at that! How about the fact that over half of the crew on this ship would have been of dark complexion (and wasn't 2015 the year there wasn't a single black Oscars nominee?? What a missed opportunity.) What about the dynamic between the fortunate class of connected Nantucket blue-bloods vs. the less fortunate non-Nantucket crew, and how that played out on the whale boats after the ship sank? How about explaining the effort of salvaging goods from a sinking Whale Ship? How about the decision to sail East to death vs West to the Marqueses or Hawaiian Islands because the crew thought there were still cannibals living out there?

This a story of adventure, reputation, inter-crew conflict, and survival.Personally I wasn't bothered by the CGI, I thought it was decent enough, and the rest of the visuals were great. However once the business of their voyage begins I found myself sympathising with the whales being harpooned more than the men being battered about the ocean, which probably took some of the intended intensity out of the viewing. There were also some issues with the editing, with some scenes chopping and changing too quickly, where they probably needed room to breathe, while other scenes definitely went on for longer than necessary (that last scene between Hemsworth and Holland comes to mind). However...Why oh why (and I say this as a Brit) did a Hollywood film based on a classic American tale, set in America, with an American producer and director (Ron Howard), an American screenwriter (Charles Leavitt) decide to hire a bunch of non-American actors to plays Americans with fake accents?! While watching the opening scenes of the film, I became more and more aware that no less than the first six characters that we hear speak, are all British (and Hemsworth) actors putting on clearly fake American accents. Now Ben Whishaw (Skyfall), Brendan Gleeson (In Bruges), Michelle Fairley (Game of Thrones), Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Charlotte Riley (Peaky Blinders) and Donald Sumpter (Game of Thrones) are all decent to fantastic actors, but the clearly non-authentic accents completely took me out of the film, and made it difficult to concentrate on the dialogue. Other British actors making up the crew of the Essex include Tom Holland, Cillian Murphy, Paul Anderson, Gary Beadle, Joseph Mawle, Jamie Sives and Sam Keeley. I joked at the time of watching it that they may as well have cast Henry Cavill as Captain Pollard instead of Benjamin Walker (one of the only American cast members) and it turned out he was one of three considered for the role!This was an absolutely bizarre choice on behalf of the producers, and I can't understand it.

I enjoyed the Experience and the Filme for the Comedye it was; for how, thought I, could it be that a Filme so large (and enacted by Beings among whom we might account the mighty Thor, Abraham Lincoln, the grand-father of Alle Behemothes, and one Scare-crow) be yet writ so Small across such a vast Screene.And the experience for What itself Was: being at the Omni-Theatre of the Minnesota Zoological Gardens, before a Screene some Ninety feet across and Seventy high, with a Sounde-system that might rival the bellowing of Zeus or Vesuvius, shared on a drizzly December night betwixt Myselfe and sixteen gentle Strangers, the youngest of whom appeared to be a Childe of some Ten Years, the eldest a Gentleman of perhaps Sixty-five.A bucket of Popped-corn and a sugary Soda provided my repast.The Failings of the Filme did unfortunately outnumber its Strengths, for while one Weasel-Lad, who was Cousine to the shippe's Captain, did provide a fine Scene of noble yet bloody Sacrifice toward the Conclusion, beforehande we Film-goers were made to bear Witnesse to the Unholy Slaughter of a blameless Behemothe, various stormes at Sea that seemed the Products of a Television Filme, and the Unspeakable Mangling of Accents by Mssrs. Thor and Scare-crow, which said mangling, whilst the Source of much-needed Laughter, yet leaves the Bones of my Eares in Knots some dayes later.In closing, deare Cousin, let me saye that the greatest Flaw of this Filme lies in its Unfathomable Mediocrity: for, given the Strength of its Pedigree, of its Tale and Themes, we might finde ourselves asked to forgive the mighty Man-o'-War placing Fifthe in a Tortoise-race.I remaine, with all kind Regarde,Your faithful Taco-nites",In the Heart of the Sea
284,chefykins50,An epic movie based on the writing of a Classic Tale.,9,15 March 2016,"This is my first review for IMDb so please bare with me.This movie , in my opinion was one of the best movies to come out in a long time , that it was not even nominated for an Academy Award is a travesty.The acting by Chris Hemsworth , Brendan Gleeson , Benjamin Walker and Cillian Murphy was outstanding and captures the imagination of the viewer into the story.Ron Howard does a brilliant job directing and the Special Effects were amazing.Based on a true story that served as the basis for Herman Melville's epic novel , Moby Dick.For anyone professing to love fishing , this is a whale of a tale and a must see.Peace Y",In the Heart of the Sea
285,lassiterjennifer991,"Chris Hemsworth told how lost weight for the role in the movie ""In the Heart of the Sea""",7,10 December 2015,"The actor had much to lose weightLast Thursday, the screens out the new movie with Chris Hemsworth, ""In the Heart of the Sea."" For the filming of the film 32-year-old actor had much to lose weight. In a recent interview with the show Good Morning America, Chris told how he managed to get rid of the mountain of muscle.""I gain weight quite fun - open up Hemsworth. You're just a lot of eating and lifting weights. And in this case had to be undernourished. Because of this, I was quite moody, and the mood is constantly changing. I had to play all these games, if I ate one, it probably will not be able to eat more. Just crazy. However, in fairness, the plot of all of us had to suffer what we did. In other words, there was not enough of one of acting. We were in despair. """,In the Heart of the Sea
286,ferranaudi-80105,"Artificial and pompous, Into The Heart of the Sea is an unpalatable mixture of bland drama, hysterical editing and a complete waste of time.",1,8 December 2015,"Terrible script going absolutely nowhere, with awful acting throughout excepting Cyllian Murphy, trooping on like a true harpooner; served with a frantic editing to make up for lack of story and sentimental music in an effort to infuse some passion where there's only a bloody mess of pixels and digital effects, albeit in 3D.There's no Heart and most certainly no Sea here. It turns John Huston's adequate 1956 film adaptation of the Mellville ""homeric epic"" into a masterpiece by comparison. Into the Heart of the Sea is bland, artificial and presumptuous unlike anything Ron Howard has shot before. Do yourself a favor: go back to Huston or even better, read Moby Dick!",In the Heart of the Sea
287,panne-19593,Action and Pace was Just Fine,10,21 December 2015,"Disregard reviews that say it was too slow. I thought it was about right. How do you hurry along being stranded at sea for weeks on end, starving and nothing but sea in every direction? If that bores you because there isn't enough action then you missed the last half of the movie and the main part of the story. It was about the crew dynamics, not conflict with a whale! In actual events, like a old time western gunfight at the OK Corral, or a military firefight in a war zone, the action is over in minutes. The lead up to it where we get to know the characters is an important part of the story, as well as, the effects of the action on the characters afterwards. In this case, the after effects are an important part of the story. All in all, it was a good balance and I did not think anything wrong with it. I am annoyed with reviewers who wanted it to be just another mindless action film.",In the Heart of the Sea
288,andirezaja,Great. Not Outstanding.,8,6 December 2015,"If you're expecting the movie is amazing and so much complexity, you'd be disappointed because the movie is good and the story is simple. I can guess the story line. Hunt the whale. Get karma and destroyed by the whale. Running out of food. Killing each other. But, that's not the real problem. The real problem is, somehow, there are some parts of story is missing from the movie. I don't know what it is. You just feel that you watch the concept of the movie.About the pictures, it is good but it's messed up when the sailors hunting the whales. The water, the whales. I still find that was computer-made. I get disappointed about the pictures.But, overall, it's very very entertaining. The pinpoint of this movie is the simplicity of the story. God bless the story!Personal rating : 7.8 of 10",In the Heart of the Sea
289,neilmakar-92436,"OK adventure film, but this is not the whaler you're looking for.",4,11 December 2015,"I just got back from watching ""In the Heart of the Sea"", and my feeling? VERY disappointing.Before I get into the problems, let me say that the performances were excellent, especially with what they were given as a screenplay, the effects astonishing (I cannot believe they didn't film an actual whale hunt) and as an adventure film pretty good.But this is as much Philbrick's book as ""Young Frankenstein"" is Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein"". The very fact that they have 3 story writer credits and only 1 screenplay credit tells you the story, pun intended. The writers read the CliffsNotes version of the CliffsNotes version of the book. In essence, the writers said ""Ok, a whale sinks a ship and the crew is shipwrecked for 90 days. Got it."" and took it from there.The book tells a fascinating and intriguing story of desperation and survival, and the movie pretty much glosses over this. The whale attack is changed from the book. The WHALE is changed from the book. The actual people who died and survived is changed from the book. The writers conflated Philbrick's true story with Melville's fictional story into one that is more fiction than truth, at the same time as being more truth than outright fiction.All of this was unnecessary. The true story is engrossing enough to have been told in a three hour film without modification. This is just, well, a waste.I am disappointed that Ron Howard let this happen. After films like ""Rush"" and ""Apollo 13"" I expected more.So. If you have read the book, don't see the movie, at least don't pay for it. If you haven't read the book, well, go on. Its a good action film. But don't think that after watching this you will have any idea of what happened to the Nantucket whaler Essex.",In the Heart of the Sea
290,cccofusa,Awesome and Redemptive,10,12 December 2015,"I'm a big fan of the 50's 'Moby Dick"" with Gregory Peck, try and top that! Ron Howard did I thought in this interpretation of a classic. I jerked a well deserved tear at the right moment and if you see the movie and have any heart you'll understand. In this lack of intelligent movie selections this period sensitive film was greatly appreciated by the whole family. Thank you! Ten Stars!!!! Highly Recommend. The CGI was excellent and should not be confused by Peta and other whale rights people as something to protest now. It is a historical part of our past and I thought very tastefully handled from the whales point of view. See the movie first because it was a good defense against whaling as well. All toll GREAT MOVIE FOR HUMAN AND WHALE><>",In the Heart of the Sea
291,comc-13970,simply magnificent,10,22 December 2015,"My last work on a film set (IN THE HEART OF THE SEA) for many years to come until all my operations are done - This is the best film you will see this year I encourage you to go and watch it Ron Howard is a fabulous director the story is based on fact thought to have been a myth until one day in someone's attic they found the diary of the young deck hand who survived, this is the story Moby dick is also loosely based on, but the story of the ESSEX is factual, Chris Hemsworth puts in a great performance as Owen Chase along with Brendan Gleeson who plays the young deck hand in his later years narrating his tale to a fledgling book writer thirsty for a story that will stun his readers,Tom Nickerson(Gleeson) reluctantly agrees to tell his tale with the blessing of his wife who has seen him in pain and torment for far too long and all the stunt team that worked on the film made some amazing stunts GO see it its out Boxing Day",In the Heart of the Sea
292,dgj-48187,Why?,4,23 December 2015,"What were you people thinking? Why, must of been money, did Philbrick actually allow such a bastardization of his novel. I can't believe he bought into this and Ron Howard has destroyed one of the best tales written. Philbrick has a new book out, but I can't buy it. He sold out, he has no credibility. I was so disappointed by this film, just a complete groan and moan. It isn't Moby Dick, It's a whole different story, and better story.I can't imagine Philbrick would be so easy / cheap, and approve this. must be a mortgage thing. It's a gratuitous relationship and insult to Melville and Thomas Nickerson. Anyone who has read this book has embraced it's tale of fear, hope, desperation and salvation. Love the book, have no respect for Philbrick and Howard.",In the Heart of the Sea
293,plucchini-18110,In the Heart of the Sea,7,6 February 2016,"What can one say you like it or you don't. It's better than the Missing that I thought was not a good movie by Howard!! this is entertaining. Yes it does have its moments of time wasting but all in all it's a good movie. Decent acting by all, not Moby Dick but does have enough drama to call it Good. The outcome was faster than I expected at the inquest, didn't give much time to absorb the Captain was not a complete Dick (No Pun intended). If you didn't catch the meaning of letting the whale pass you need to watch it again as mammal to mammal it was obvious, you messed with my Pod to kill I am not like you humans! the whale was most intelligent. Not making much at the box office at this time shame as I thought it was worth watching.",In the Heart of the Sea
294,thilopukall,"Decent, but not a must watch.",5,10 June 2021,"The movie relies heavily on what I call the ""shaking camera"" method. What you do is you take the most generic dramatic music you can find, you shoot a scene and shake the camera whilst doing so, voila, an action scene is done.
