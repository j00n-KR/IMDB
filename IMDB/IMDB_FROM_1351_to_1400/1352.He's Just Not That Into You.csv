She blames her failures to the much passed around notion that guys act like jerks to girls they like. Alex (Justin Long) is a bar manager who just can't see how cute Ginnifer Goodwin is. It marks the reunion of these two actors from TV show Ed. That's the good part. If that's all, then this would a simple good rom-com.This is yet another pretty-girl-who-can't-find-a-good-guy rom-com. There's nothing with that other than it's utterly unoriginal. For some reason, all kinds of A-listers descended on this film. Chances are that Drew Barrymore as producer called in quite a few favors. Scarlett Johansson, Bradley Cooper, Ben Affleck, Jennifer Aniston, and Jennifer Connelly are just the big names. The trouble is that they are very distracting. With all the different story lines, none of the actors get enough screen time. They are just sucking away the screen time for the main leads. Luckily I like all the actors involved. Ginniger Goodwin is adorable. If they kept it simple, they would have a great rom-com.",He's Just Not That Into You

2,kosmasp,Wasted potential,5,14 June 2009,"In more than one sense. Story wise and actor/actress wise too. It's especially a shame, because it has a pretty strong beginning, has great actors in it and it seems to put a new spin on things. The main word is of course ""seems"".Because in the end, it falls back on clichés that it made fun of at the beginning. A movie with more than one main character isn't so new either. We have seen quite a few movies, that are far superior in the same vain(see Playing by heart just for one great example).Having characters saying things that should be clear by that moment in a long running relationship, just isn't right. But those things (and most of the ""real"" dialogue) are minor things, that don't really matter that much. What matters is, that actors get wasted and seem completely out of touch.The movie still gets points for trying. And women seem to love the movie more than men. Still another great movie, that handles relationships and their drama far better is called ""L'ultimo bacio"", an Italian production, which got remade in America as ""The Last Kiss"". I saw both and I'd say the original is better. Watch that for ""real"" drama and real people and almost no clichés.",He's Just Not That Into You
3,jboothmillard,He's Just Not That Into You,4,1 April 2012,"I heard some good things about this all star cast film with the easy to like theme and genre, but I was mistaken thinking that the critics liked it, and I only found that out after watching it, I can see what they mean now looking back, from director Ken Kwapis (License to Wed). Basically the story is set in Baltimore where five women and four men are trying to work their relationship and romantic problems, they are giving mixed signals to their other halves, or they are unsure what they really want. Single young woman Gigi Phillips (Mona Lisa Smile's Ginnifer Goodwin) has been having many unsuccessful dates with men, and constantly seeks advice and reality checks from her friend, sweet but cynical saloon keeper Alex (Justin Long). Gigi's friend and co-worker Janine (Jennifer Connelly) is having trouble in her recent marriage to Ben Gunders (Bradley Cooper), unaware he has become attracted to and is having an affair with Anna Marks (Scarlett Johansson). Anna also gets the attention of Conor Barry (Kevin Connolly), and it is only after she falls out with Ben that she decides to go with it, but she later admits that she doesn't want to go any further in the relationship. Gig's other coworker Beth Murphy (Jennifer Aniston) lives with boyfriend Neil Jones (Ben Affleck), she wants to get married after seven years but he does not believe in it, so eventually they break up, but after so many preparations for a wedding, and after her father Ken (Kris Kristofferson) has a heart attack, they do rekindle. Also seen trying to get somewhere with a man is kooky but likable Mary Harris (Drew Barrymore) who goes for the internet dating option, and she does eventually find that with Conor after helping him get business in ad columns. By the end of the film, Janine wants a divorce from Ben after finding out about the affair, Anna gets to perform as a singer on stage, Beth and Neil get married on a sailboat, and Gigi realises Alex may be the one after a long time and they do start a relationship. Also starring Luis Guzmán as Javier. The well known faces all get their equal amount of time on screen, Johansson is certainly the sexiest of the women, and Cooper is probably most watchable as the sleaze, I think Barrymore could have been on a bit more but she is nice as the slightly weird love seeking geek. I can see the connection to Sex and the City, because it is mostly from the perspective and side of the women, so it is not the most original of multi-layered story telling, but there are a few amusing moments, and some of the love stories are interesting to see play out, not a bad romantic comedy. Okay!",He's Just Not That Into You
4,tavm,He's Just Not That Into You was a nice rom-com surprise to me!,7,25 February 2009,"If you were fans of the following television shows: ""My So-Called Life"", ""Freaks and Geeks"", ""Friends"", ""Alias"", ""Ed"", and ""Dawson's Creek"", then I'd highly recommend this movie to you as a player or two from each of those series are in this movie! Among them: Wilson Cruz (MSCL), Busy Philipps (F&G and DC), Jennifer Anniston (Friends), Bradley Cooper (Alias), Justin Long and Ginnifer Goodwin (Ed), and Sasha Alexander (DC). Add Drew Barrymore, Jennifer Connelly, Scarlett Johansson, Ben Affleck, and Kris Kristofferson and you get a nearly all-star cast of this pretty amusing yet mostly entertaining multiple-character romantic comedy. Ken Kwapis as the director manages to mostly balance the various stories to their natural conclusions with not everyone getting the ""happy ending"" but some satisfied with their ""life goes on"" fate. And Long and Goodwin, both of whom had played characters romantically involved on ""Ed"", are two of the most appealing players here. So on that note, I highly recommend He's Just Not That Into You.",He's Just Not That Into You
5,ComedyFan2010,A decent chick flick,7,17 April 2010,"As someone who likes chick flicks I wasn't disappointed in this movie. It was funny, had a great cast and had an interesting story.My favourite was the relationship of Ben Affleck and Jennifer Anniston, and this is also the only relationship where I was disappointed in the end. I thought it was great how they showed that a man who doesn't believe in the social institution of marriage can still be a much better and loving partner than someone who is married. And at the end when Jennifer finally understands it and accepts it he proposes. WTF? I guess it was made because they wanted to make it 100% a happy end and for some women it can't be without the ring, but in my opinion it ruined what this couple was supposed to represent: true love that doesn't follow silly social standards.Other than that I think it was great. I dislike some characters and liked others but they were all very well done.",He's Just Not That Into You
6,edwagreen,Not Just into You- Going the Other Way ***,7,26 December 2009,"This is a contemporary film which really makes the guys look bad.Ben Affleck rarely appears in the film and he was probably better off for it.The picture, nonetheless, is decent because it deals with today's lives- relationships between men and women- the falsehoods, innuendos, the misgivings, the cheating, and a look at love included.The movie does make a case for the point that some people are not mature enough to go into marriage. Other women press the flesh constantly searching for the right men but coming up short. One woman goes through this and doesn't realize that the man who tells her what to do in individual situations in really the guy for her.Jennifer Connolly, the Oscar winner for ""A Beautiful Mind,"" steals the show here as a woman who married a guy who just wasn't ready for such a commitment. Equally good is Jennifer Aniston who realizes, only when her father is taken ill, that commitment isn't necessarily achieved through marriage as well as the doing of good deeds.An interesting film highlighting today's values.",He's Just Not That Into You

Ten people in Baltimore deal with their respective romantic problems, usually thwarted by the differing ideals and desires of their chosen partner.This was directed by Ken Kwapis.At the center of this movie is Gigi,a young woman who repeatedly misinterprets the behavior of her romantic partners and tries her best at attempting to understand the mixed signals she gets from the men she's dating. She gets advice from a bar owner (Justin Long) who prides himself on understanding the ins and outs of the dating scene. Gigi's co-worker Janine finds herself involved in a major redecorating project with her husband, Ben. Unknown to Janine, Ben contemplates an affair with Anna, an attractive woman trying to make a career as a singer. Another of Gigi's friends at work, Beth, enjoys a successful, healthy relationship with Neil, but storm clouds hover over them as he has no interest in getting married.This could have been an interesting multi-character film. Unfortunately,devotes too little time to each of its characters which reduces them to stereotypes.Also,it adds nothing new to this type of movie genres that is why it becomes cliché,formulaic and average.",He's Just Not That Into You
8,studioAT,Not that bad. Sadly not that great either,3,11 August 2017,"This film seems to really divide people, and while it doesn't exactly paint men in a good light (in most cases) it's a fairly enjoyable enough romantic film, with a good cast.It is however a bit long, almost as if it was trying to give all of the star players in the cast the chance to shine. Jennifer Aniston looks bored, and it's a shame that Drew Barrymore didn't have more to do at times.It has a few odd messages during its run time, and certainly has a strong 'women are awesome, men not so much' vibe to it, but for likable performances from Justin Long and Ginnifer Goodwin it's not that bad.",He's Just Not That Into You
9,preppy-3,Insipid chick flick,1,15 February 2009,"SPOILERS! Lousy movie. Pathetic loser Gigi (Gennifer Goodwin) takes dating advice from know it all Alex (Justin Long). Mary (Drew Barrymore) is having trouble finding ANY man! Conor (Kevin Connolly) is having the same trouble finding a woman. Married Ben (Bradley Cooper) to Janinie (Jennifer Connolly) falls into an affair with single Anna (Scarlett Johansson). AND Neil (Ben Affleck) and Beth (Jennifer Aniston) have been living together for 7 years. He's faithful to her--but she starts realizing she may need a commitment. Got all that?I was dying to see this movie! I love chick flicks and the cast of this had me excited. I thought with all these great actors how can it be bad? Well--I found out! The script is lousy--full of lines that real people would never utter. People in my audience were laughing at the serious parts! A few people walked out! Every single character in this is unlikable--there's not ONE character you could identify with. Gigi especially was incredibly annoying. Also all the stories are utterly predictable leading to outcomes that had the audience groaning and laughing. You would think with the cast the acting would be good. WRONG! Aniston and Johansson are easily the worst actors in this. The best were Cooper, Barrymore and Long. The rest were in the middle. Worst of all is its portrayal of women. They'll all needy, clinging, stupid, obnoxious and basically brain-dead idiots. The men don't come off much better. They all come of as being terrified of commitments, cheaters and liars.

11,zardoz-13,Losing At Love Means Winning At the End,8,20 February 2009,"""He's Just Not Into You"" is an ensemble romantic comedy that succeeds most of the time, but has its weak moments and the entire affair seems to stall out at times. The message is that men are basically something the dog left on the street and women must suffer and endure their torment in pursuit of them. ""Sex and the City"" scenarists Greg Behrendt and Liz Tuccillo wrote the novel that Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein adapted. Neil (Ben Affleck) swears that he will never marry Beth (Jennifer Aniston), so they break up. He goes to live on his boat and she is basically unhappy. Ben (Bradley Cooper) is married to Janine (Jennifer Connelly), but he's cheating on her with Anna (Scarlett Johansson), a crooner looking for her big break. At the same time, Anna is stringing along real estate agent Connor (Kevin Connelly) who initially goes out with Gigi. Beth suspects that something is going on behind her back with Ben because he lies to her about quitting cigarettes. Alex (Justin Long) manages a popular bar where couples hangs out and he tries to clue Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin) in on how the psychology of men. Somewhere on the edges of the occasionally cute comedy lurks Mary (Drew Barrymore--she was one of the producers but she doesn't give herself much time on screen--and she's looking for love, too. Indeed, this movie is about the ups and downs of dating and the 'rules' that supposedly apply to relationships. You'll figure out quickly who is going to get the shaft and who is going to win. Cute little Ginnifer Goodwin makes the movie as a die-hard romantic Gigi who refuses to give up. Her off and on relationship with Justin Long is fine right up until she drops him and then unaccountably turns around and . . . you'll have to watch the movie. Bradley Cooper is the obnoxious one and Scarlett Johansson is the other half of the bad girl. The scene where Bradley sends Scarlett scurrying into the closet is amusing. Academy Award winning Jennifer Connelly deserves better than this lightweight lark of movie. Ben Affleck looks like he must have dropped a lot of weight. This movie is very pro-Gay, too, with several sympathetically portrayed Gay characters. This would not have happened ten years ago. Oh, yes, Drew wins in the end, too, and the guys that she gets is deserving. Good folks are rewarded and bad folks get punished. Nobody gets naked and the dialogue is pretty clean.""License to Wed"" director Ken Kwapis intersperses several interesting episodes between the different stories and show people from other parts of the world discussing how love works, sometimes in subtitles. Gigi is the primary character here and she cannot understand why men don't call her back. This was for me the incredible part of the film. Ginnifer Goodwin is a really sexy version of Sally Field. It is difficult to imagine men not falling down in front of her just so that they can feel her high heels spiking them in the spine as she trots over them. Kris Kristofferson has a supporting role as Jennifer Aniston's father. This is definitely a feel-good date movie.",He's Just Not That Into You
12,george.schmidt,Overstuffed ensemble romantic comedy ; comes off like a second-hand Valentine's Day card.,6,9 February 2009,"HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU (2009) ** Jennifer Aniston, Ben Affleck, Jennifer Connelly, Bradley Cooper, Ginnifer Goodwin, Justin Long, Scarlett Johansson, Kevin Connolly, Drew Barrymore, Busy Philipps, Kris Kristofferson. Overstuffed ensemble romantic comedy adaptation of the popular book of the same name with several couples showcased on the verge of falling in and out of love with each other. The screenplay leaves a lot to be desired for by Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein with some truly stilted dialogue and cringe-inducing situations that make both sexes seem inept at the subjects of love, sex and romance but the game and talented cast makes the most of what is given, particularly the clueless Goodwin and unlikely lady-killer Long as the obvious cute couple who don't recognize the obvious. Comes off like a second-hand Valentine's Day card. (Dir: Ken Kwapis)",He's Just Not That Into You
13,neil-476,Sitcom not romcom,7,27 February 2009,"I hesitate to call this a romcom. It's one of those films like Love Actually where you get a look into a number of different relationships, each of which has different problems. The conceit here is that in all the couples, one of the partners knows someone in one of the other couples. However, these links form no part of the plot as regards relationships, so are essentially irrelevant (thankfully I stopped waiting for them to be worked into the plot/s after a while). The humour is mostly observational and much of it derives from the various ""rules"" of relationships offered to the exceptionally needy and desperate Gigi by her friends, especially bar owner Alex.I liked much about this film. I particularly liked the fact that not all the relationships resolved tidily - indeed, there were some that never could. The characters were all likable but flawed, and I was happy to be in their company. Notwithstanding the romcom/sitcom nature of the film, there were some serious moments, and both Jennifers (Aniston and Connelly) got a chance to show some acting chops as, briefly, did Scarlett Johansson (although she showed rather more of her underwear. Which I liked). And I liked the fact that the film ultimately made it clear that the ""rules"" being offered to Gigi were, in the end, no more than generalisations and that the exceptions to them were equally important. There is little bad language and, notwithstanding that the movie as about relationships, it isn't particularly frank or smutty apart from the aforementioned scene involving Scarlett in her scanties which is, to be fair, graphic without being explicit, and a little out of sync with the rest of the movie.It was good to see Jennifer Connelly doing some rather broader comedy than I'm used to - for my money, the funniest part of the film is a bizarre and somewhat surrealistic conversation between her and refurbishment contractor Javier (Luis Guzman) over whether one of the workmen has been smoking.I liked this film for what it wasn't - it is definitely a good deal less formulaic than many of the comedies which have been doing the rounds recently - as much as what it was.",He's Just Not That Into You
14,evanston_dad,I'm Just Not That Into This Movie,5,8 June 2009,"A limp ensemble relationship movie that feels like the frustrated venting of a bitter single girl after a blind date gone badly awry.This is the kind of movie where a bunch of 20 and 30-somethings own beautiful loft apartments they couldn't possibly afford and struggle with relationship issues that are just boring to watch other people grapple with if you yourself are over the age of 30. Once again we're expected to accept Jennifer Aniston as a sad sack who can't get a date after she dumps the long-time boyfriend (Ben Affleck, playing not so much a character as a woman's fantasy made real) who won't commit to marriage. Ginnifer Goodwin is the doormat who can't figure out why guys won't call her even though they say they will. Justin Long is terribly miscast as a womanizer who doesn't know when he's fallen in love himself (I can't look at him without seeing the image of his dork from ""Dodgeball"" getting hit in the face with a wrench, which is not far from what I wanted to do to his character in this movie). Jennifer Connelly and Bradley Cooper are the lone married couple in the film, and because this is a Hollywood movie about relationships, of course the married couple MUST be miserable. Scarlett Johanssen is a bombshell with giant knockers that I couldn't take my eyes off of; Drew Barrymore might as well not be in the movie, and only is because a.) she co-produced it and b.) the filmmakers needed a forum in which to introduce a bunch of stock gay characters. You want to throttle pretty much everyone by the time the movie's over; I settled for thanking God I didn't have to be friends with any of them.Though the film was only written by two people, it has the feeling of something written by committee. Characters aren't consistent or believable; those played by Goodwin and Connelly more often than not come across as mentally ill. In the world of this film, there are only two kinds of marriages: the ones that end in adultery and bitterness, or the ones that end in a ridiculously romanticized version of happily-ever-after. No wonder so many people have trouble making marriages work if they're using films like this as examples.What a dud, and probably solid evidence that movies shouldn't be adapted from smug and jokey self-help books written by jackass talk show hosts.Grade: C+",He's Just Not That Into You
15,Uriah43,A Light-Hearted Drama,6,25 June 2016,"""Gigi"" (Ginnifer Goodwin) is all confused about men. As a result she constantly gets the signals men send her all mixed up and her dating life suffers dramatically. Fortunately, she has a couple of friends she works with named ""Beth"" (Jennifer Anniston) and ""Janine"" (Jennifer Connelly) to lend her advice and emotional support. Unfortunately, their personal lives suddenly become as emotionally unstable as hers and they begin to need advice and support from her. For example, Beth has been living with ""Neil"" (Ben Affleck) for seven years and she starts to fear that he doesn't want a long-term commitment. Janine, on the other hand, is married but she begins to suspect that her husband ""Ben"" (Bradley Cooper) is concealing something from her. Additionally, there are other characters in this movie who have other issues as well. However, rather than reveal too much I will just say that this was a cute movie which had quite a bit of drama and not nearly as much humor as I would have liked. Even so, the director (Ken Kwapis) managed to keep a good balance between the drama and comedy so that it didn't get too serious overall. In any case, although this certainly wasn't a great movie by any means, I enjoyed the movie for the most part and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",He's Just Not That Into You
16,ferguson-6,No Exception,4,8 February 2009,"Greetings again from the darkness. I really tried not to dislike this movie, but it just gave me nothing. The only two scenes that gave me brief hope were the grammar exchange between Jennifer Connelly and Luis Guzman, and Drew Barrymore spouting off the maze of communication devices that prevent actual human contact in today's social environment.As a guy, I find it amazing that the four lead women roles (Connelly, Barrymore, Jennifer Aniston and Ginnifer Goodwin) are all north of 30 (with two pushing 40). Haven't they learned anything? The only young one is Scarlett Johansson, who manages to screw up the lives of two guys. And speaking of guys ... they are all buffoons (Justin Long, Kevin Connolly, Bradley Cooper), except for boring Ben Affleck in the most unbelievable of all the fairy tales. When Kris Kristofferson makes his entrance, the anticipation grew. Within a couple of minutes it was crushed as he lay on the floor grasping his chest.I know people are stupid when it comes to relationships. Otherwise, Dr Laura, Dr Phil, Oprah, etc etc wouldn't be nearly as rich as they are. Still, it shouldn't take a book and a movie for people to have some understanding of when there is a mutual connection. My only warning is don't mistake this as a date movie.

Everybody acts like a complete moron. It is several subplots of broken relationships from Drew Barrymore receiving a cheating voice mail, to Jennifer Connelly learning that her husband is cheating, to Jennifer Aniston dealing with inferiority, to Scarlett Johansson caught in an affair. Mediocre directing by Ken Kwapis with a screenplay fit for toilet paper. Kwapis previously directed a wonderful teen drama called The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants. That film had an idea and interesting personalities within the characters who inhabited it. With this film it seems that the characters are the total opposite. Instead of being intriguing with clever plot points they are driven through yawner clichés and imbecilic situations. It is depressing to see actors with genuine talent walk into material this unforgiving. Barrymore, Connelly, Aniston, and Johansson will survive this dread and hopefully not repeat it. How unfortunate that this much talent isn't assembled for something above moron level. It poises arguments regarding marriage and commitment otherwise I just wasn't that into it.

It reminded me of one of those Garry Marshall films named after a holiday with all-star casts, each on the screen for about ten minutes, and each luring hopefully enough people to the theaters on opening weekend to make up the cost of their salary. Only, instead of an incredibly goopy layer of cheese mixed in with each vignette, He's Just Not That Into You is dipped in cynicism and hopelessness.Why would anyone want to go see a movie in which several couples and hopeful couples try like Hades to make their relationships work, only to have infidelity, cruelty, and general disinterest get in the way?

At least not for the typical cliché after another type of romantic comedy, where the males are one dimensional and only an accessory to women. Where the women are somehow the most intolerable person on Earth but learns who she truly is at the end and had to find a man to figure it out. Where the best friend asks uncomfortable questions to a strange man if he's gay, where the parents are at all not normal and do strange things like dance naked in the woods, where the gay guy knows all about relationships, where the leads have the big kiss in front on family and friends some how, where the OK, you don't need me to go on. But based on the Sex and the City created book, He's Just Not That Into You was a relationship guide for the women and men who need to get a clue when you go on a date and the person isn't calling. ""He's out of town"", ""She said she just got out of a bad relationship"", ""He may have lost my number"", ""She said she had a busy job"", the list goes on with the excuses when all you want to do is honestly tell your friend ""nope, sounds like they're just not into you"". Why is it so hard to say? Why not be blunt? It would save us a whole lot of time and sanity and this is what the movie explores.Gigi is an actively dating single woman who repeatedly misreads mundane actions and comments from her dates as indications they are romantically interested in her. Stood up at the bar one evening she befriends the promiscuous bar manager Alex who reveals the strategies guys use to avoid a girl. This friendship continues and his eagerness to always assist, interpreted by Gigi as a sign that he is interested in her. We move onto Janine who is starting to have difficulties in her marriage to Ben. With Janine focused on their home renovations Ben becomes attracted to Anna, a yoga instructor and aspiring singer, and the feeling is mutual. During a tense shopping trip to select wood finishes Ben reveals to Janine that he slept with someone. Janine is devastated but rationalizes Ben's behavior, blames herself for being too cold in the relationship, and declares she wants to salvage the marriage. We then meet Beth, who is living with her boyfriend Neil, who is also friends. After seven years together Beth wants to get married, but Neil does not believe in marriage. Beth confronts Neil about the problem. When he still doesn't want to get married she breaks up with him. But is it possible with all the heartache, does ""happily ever after"" still exist? You'll have to find out.While the movie does have some cliché moments and ties together too well at the end over all, I'd say that He's Just Not That Into You was worth the watch for me. There was a lot of honesty in the film that is so based on the modern relationship we face today. While the plots are a lot to keep up with, we each have one story to relate too or maybe even all of them. Pretty much I had something to relate to each story, we learn lessons as we grow up, some don't though as I have friends that each fit into the categories of: the clueless, the desperate, the promiscuous, the heart broken, etc. Watching this movie with my friends was actually an interesting experience as for some reason it brought up a good conversation afterwards. While the movie is a romantic comedy and not the best that I've seen, it's one of the better ones' than our too predictable yucky slop of what these directors call a film. I would recommend this movie for most people, everyone that I watched this with enjoyed the film.

22,Buddy-51,a clunker despite all its star-power,4,20 February 2010,"An all-star cast - Ben Affleck, Jennifer Anniston, Jennifer Connelly, Kevin Connolly, Drew Barrymore, Bradley Cooper, Ginnifer Goodwin, Scarlett Johansson, Justin Long and Kris Kristofferson - hits the skids in ""He's Just Not That Into You,"" a supposedly insightful and epic look into the complex dynamics of man/woman relationships that could single-handedly turn members of both sexes off romance forever.In this misguided endeavor (the only thing really clever about it is the title), it's hard to tell which gender comes off worse - the women, who are all portrayed as needy, insecure, controlling, man-hungry whiners, or the men, who are all inconsiderate, self-centered louts. And this battle-of-the-sexes face-off goes on for a grueling two hours and nine minutes.The specific details of the romantic roundelay the characters put us through doesn't really bear repeating here. Suffice it to say that the actors do what they can with the material - the movie was written by Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein (based on the novel by Greg Berhrendt and Liz Tuccillo) and directed by Ken Kwapis - and that most of the characters manage to see the errors of their ways in time for the obligatory happy ending (could that possibly qualify as a plot ""spoiler""? Only if you have never seen a romantic comedy before, I suppose). Barrymore does get off a few choice lines about how hard it is to date in a world dominated by email, cell phones, text messaging, voicemail, and a whole host of other technological gadgets that actually make communication MORE difficult rather than less so, but that's pretty much it in the inspired cleverness-and-laughs department.And a couple of other points: why is it that, in a movie that takes place in a modern urban setting, the producers couldn't cast even one person of color in a major role (there are plenty of them in the background appearing as waiters, however)? And what's with all the gay guys, with their limp-wristed affectations and ""You go, girl!"" theatrics? Somehow, I thought we'd gotten past all that by this point. It isn't even a matter of being politically correct; it's a matter of creating a credible environment for the movie to tell its story in.If you're interested in watching a genuinely great romantic comedy, skip ""He's Just Not That Into You"" and check out the 1967 classic ""Two For the Road,"" starring Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney, and see how truly insightful and thoughtful a movie romance can be!",He's Just Not That Into You
23,Robert_duder,Cute and watchable but runs a little long,7,16 March 2009,"He's Just Not That Into You was heralded as the latest great romantic date movie chick flick. With a solid huge cast of stars it's easy to understand the draw to the film. I suppose if anything really positive could be said about the film it would be that it gives itself exactly what it says it will. You go in with the expectations and it meets those but doesn't really exceed or really impress. The cast is good, the story is good, the character are good...everything about is good...not excellent, or amazing, just good and there is nothing wrong with that. From a feminist perspective (even though I'm a dude) the message is kind of twisted and doesn't really do anything for the female role. Most of the women in the film are rather spineless and obsessed with finding the right man. Even the one storyline that is supposed to empower really doesn't in my opinion. The idea behind it is that you're supposed to see male and female from the different perspectives of each relationship or budding relationship but really all the couples are neurotic and needy. But without over analyzing the heck out of a simple romantic comedy the movie delivers a good entertaining time.I will have to cut down on my reviews of the cast given how huge it is. Ginnifer Goodwin sort of headlines the cast as desperate and romantic Gigi. Goodwin is cute and fun, and handles comedy easily. She doesn't really stand out but she does well in the role. Scarlett Johansson does what she does best as the insatiably sexy Anna. The girl is smoking hot in this movie but never really moves her character beyond sexy and empty basically. Jennifer Aniston is good in her role but has one of the smallest story lines but the most romantic in the film oddly enough. I would have rather seen her and Ben Affleck play opposite each other the whole film. I admit I am not a fan of Jennifer Connellys. This film didn't help any. I thought her character was extremely neurotic, weak, needy, whiny, and downright annoying. I couldn't have cared less when she overcame her shortcomings. Drew Barrymore pops in as nothing more than a cameo but a cute and funny cameo nonetheless. Kevin Connolly plays Conor. Connolly's role probably goes through the biggest changes in the film. He starts as being kind of slimy but by the end of the film you realize he is only looking for true love as well and he is likable. Bradley Cooper plays Connelly's husband who starts as likable but by the end of the film is mostly the scumbag. However he has great chemistry with Johansson and does an okay job. Ben Affleck has a small role as Aniston's boyfriend. Again he does very well but it's such a small role and I would rather have watched him and Aniston. I saved the best for last because Justin Long is probably the best character and gives the best performance in the film. Long is terrific as wisecracking, confident, womanizing Alex. He has great chemistry opposite Goodwin and turns in a performance better than everyone else proving he is a star to be reckoned with.Coming mostly from Television director Ken Kwapis is no stranger to comedy. He does expertly handle the intersecting story lines and keeps everything understandable. In amateur hands this film could have been a confusing mess given all the stories in one film. Kwapis keeps the pace flowing nicely although it still could have been far shorter and I could have done without a few of the characters to focus on the better ones like Goodwin and Long, and Affleck and Aniston. This makes a good date movie or even if you want a romantic comedy that guys and girls can enjoy equally. It's worth seeing but don't overhype it more than what it is. 7.5/10",He's Just Not That Into You
24,Lejink,Couldn't get into it.,3,26 September 2011,"Honestly, I don't know how many chick-flick rom-coms I have to watch before I find one that a) connects in even the smallest way and b) makes me laugh. Maybe like Ginnifer character in this film if I keep watching enough of them a good one will come along but I won't get my hopes up too high.Here we have a bunch of beautiful thirty-somethings loosely connected either by events or mutual friends all trying to find ""big luuurve"" in Baltimore. Some do, some don't but not one of them or their contrived personal lives or circumstances got me interested in their stories far less raised a smile.The film tries to make some sort of comment about love in the modern world of impersonal communication media but falls flat at every turn. The various, I hesitate to use the word characters here, are all self-obsessed and as lifelike as a Madame Tussaud model. The dialogue drops clichés at every turn and you just know when a serious point or sad scene is arriving because on cue a piece of soft piano music will well up in the background. Oddly, the various segments of the film are introduced by what are supposed to be amusing but in fact turn out to be very lame and fake ""vox-pops"".The acting is as dire as the writing too and I ran out of toes to curl up as one mawkishly played scene followed another. Not one line of speech seemed real and you can see pretty much everybody acting - not one of them gets behind their character, you're just vaguely aware of Ben Affleck, Jennifer Aniston, Drew Barrymore (thanks for executive producing this, Drew, by the way, - not!) and everyone else being on screen wasting their and your time with every passing minute.It amazes me that American TV can regularly knock out genuinely funny and engaging 30 minute sit-coms while Hollywood almost invariably falls flat when extending the genre into a movie format.",He's Just Not That Into You
25,paul2001sw-1,Four clichés and a stereotype,4,14 July 2009,"All clichés are rooted in truth; but fail to capture the complexity of that truth. 'He's Just Not That Into You' is a particularly pointless, and somewhat insidious romantic comedy, which seems to have been written simply by taking a number of clichés about love and expanding them into dramatic segments that succeed in telling the audience precisely nothing they did not already know. Although this isn't exactly true either, because the core idea - that many women are so up themselves that they can't spot that men don't like them - seems less a cliché than decidedly odd, perhaps explained by the fact that it isn't a hoary old chestnut but a line from a sitcom, ridiculously expanded into the premise for a movie. The conclusion is predictable in any case - a ""happy"" convergence of opposite extremes, such as is found in every movie of this type. Sadly, this isn't a funny film; and it's pretensions to insight only make things worse. I don't know anyone whose relationships, or more generally life, are reflected by this film.",He's Just Not That Into You
26,MLDinTN,too many story lines,6,21 December 2009,"I thought this movie was OK, but had too many story lines. Gigi was the central character; she was a girl looking for a guy and was completely clueless about what girls say and what they really mean. A lot of her time is spent waiting for the phone to ring or debating if she should call. She has two coworkers, Janine and Beth, she confides in and the movie goes into their relationships. And there are several other players in this. The movie shows all different kinds of relationships, from a cheating husband to a guy that doesn't want to marry. The problem is there were so many characters, the movie doesn't have time to really focus on any of them and the characters are not well developed.FINAL VERDICT: This movie is for those that are sort of like the character Gigi. If you don't need dating lessons, then I would skip this.",He's Just Not That Into You
27,cricketbat,A fairly standard romantic comedy,5,25 July 2018,"The real stand-out moments from He's Just Not That Into You come from Ginnifer Goodwin and Jennifer Connelly - both of these women did a fantastic job with the roles they were given. Other than those two characters, this is a fairly standard romantic comedy. This movie loses its way in the middle, but it wraps up pretty well in the end. It's fun, and it offers some sound advice, but it's no Love Actually.",He's Just Not That Into You
28,inkblot11,"Most romantic comedy fans will get ""into"" this fine flick and take home that feelgood spirit",8,11 February 2009,"Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin) is searching for her true love in the city of Baltimore. As she is set up by friends and co-workers, she often takes a shine to her dates but, frequently, the gentlemen involved never call her again. This could be, in part, because Gigi leaves phone and text messages for her dates to the point of scaring any caring men away. Meanwhile, a married twosome, Ben and Janine (Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Connelly) are restoring a lovely townhouse but having personal problems. This is compounded by the fact that hubby meets a yoga instructor-aspiring singer, Anna (Scarlett Johanssen) at a corner grocery and is smitten. Despite his protestations that he is married, the two meet again. Also in the ""raven"" city is a longtime-together couple, Beth (Jennifer Aniston) and Neil (Ben Affleck) who are at odds, too, for Beth longs for marriage and Neil, despite his love for his lady, doesn't care for formalities. Finally, bar manager Alex (Justin Long) cynically gives advice to Gigi about men, real estate salesman Conor (Kevin Connolly) pines for Anna and newspaper ad-lady Mary (Drew Barrymore) is trying to make a love connection for herself, too. Will these fine folks get their ""hearts desires"" when it comes to amour? This is a fine, fine romantic comedy with an edge often missing from the standard fare. Yes, the characters in this film are searching for happily ever after but learn that reality may fall a bit short, sometimes. The ensemble cast is truly wonderful, with all of the actors giving nice turns as the romance seekers. But, then, they all have great lines to deliver, as the script is loaded with truth, laughs, and pathos. One surprise is that the Baltimore setting is absolutely lovely, especially the fine old apartment buildings where the characters dwell and the beautiful coast. Seeing these venues might tempt someone to book their next mini-vacation in this fine old town. However, the costumes are a mixed-bag, with Johannsen appearing gorgeous beyond measure and Goodwin looking fine, too, but J. Connelly sporting clothes that stifle her great beauty. On the other hand, the film's snappy direction and fine production values are assets. The bottom line is that while the film will please romcom enthusiasts it will also entertain those who usually attend movies of this genre with reluctance. Most filmgoers will get ""into"" this one and take home that feelgood spirit.",He's Just Not That Into You
29,tabuno,"An Uneven, But Nevertheless Insightful, Entertaining Movie About Love",7,20 January 2019,"26 April 2009. This movie could have been cutting edge great, but due to uneven editing, probably to large a cast of characters, and an uncertain tonality modality (consistent theme, mood, genre), this movie failed to consistently hit the high mark for a serious movie on relationships. This revealing movie, this in your face, truthful movie asked the right questions, revealed some of the right answers but did it in a way that was at times confusing and unnecessary. Was this a comedy, a drama? The trailers made the movie out to be a comedy.The director made some good calls with Kris Kristofferson's screen presence. Unfortunately, he also allowed several scenes to go too long, though the ending cut back to Jennifer Aniston and Ben Affleck while at first redundant, redeemed itself. The bartender/owner's later reactions felt a bit dense. There were some good scenes about relationships, some good interplay and conflict on screen dealing with love and marriage. The scenarios also felt balanced and the movie had a solid ending.Overall, this is a good movie that could have been made far better, but well worth seeing nevertheless. 7/10.",He's Just Not That Into You
30,slightlymad22,"Not what I was expecting, but I was, unexpectedly in to it",7,29 September 2014,"This was in TV last night and I knew nothing about the movie except this synopsis""He is Just Not That In To You: Romantic comedy based on best selling novel starring Jennifer Aniston and Bradley Cooper.""I would say that is an awful synopsis, Whilst it based on a novel. It is much more than your standard romantic comedy, Aniston and Cooper are not a couple and don't even share a scene. So I did not get what I expected. I got much more. Five women and four men try to sort out the signals that the sexes exchange. Gigi (An adorable Ginnifer Goodwin) imagines every man she meets is Mr. Right; she starts getting tips from Alex (Justin Long), the manager of a bar. Janine (Jennifer Connelly) and Ben (Bradley Cooper) seem solidly married until he meets Anna (Scarlett Johansson), meanwhile Anna is indifferent to the pursing Connor. Neil (Ben Affleck) and Beth (Jennifer Aniston) have been together seven years; she worried does he really love her? As he won't commit to marriage. And Mary (Drew Barymore) sells advertising while searching on line for a man. With it's impossibly gorgeous cast, I thought this would have down better than it did. The cast do much more than just look good, all of them bring great believable performances. I don't understand the hate that Affleck gets, as I usually enjoy his movies that vary in tone, style and subject matter drastically 'Company Men' or 'Armageddon' 'Argo' and 'Hollywoodland' or the (what I consider the under rated 'Jersey Girl' I enjoy him in all of them. I'll admit from the off, that I am bias. I love Jennifer Aniston. With her gorgeous girl next door looks, I adore her, and will usually give anything she is in a chance. she remains one of the most talented and beautiful women in movies, and her ladylike sexiness is in rare supply. Any movie becomes promising just by having her name in it's cast.Bradley Cooper is more than just a good looking guy as he showed in movies such as 'A Place Beyond The Pines' and his dilemma of pursuing the gorgeous Scarlett Johansson, whilst married to his cold, unaffectionate childhood sweetheart Jennifer Connelly does give you something to ponder. But for me the star of the movie was Ginnifer Goodwin!! She is simply adorable, and is the only person I actually rooted for all the way through. She is so eager to please, and is desperate for Mr Right, she over analyses every little thing. She reminds me of a young Carla Gugino, I hope to see more of her in the future.",He's Just Not That Into You
31,Rodrigo_Amaro,I've been on that road before,6,8 January 2011,"And Hollywood did it again! ""He's Just Not That Into You"" collects clichés after clichés to built another plot that balances romance and comedy yet to be a almost poignant romantic tale about how guys don't care about girls and how they do care but they do not show, and the girls who cry, waiting for their call, falling in despair. As a comedy the movie doesn't work too much; as a drama has its good moments; but as romantic film...well, as I said the movie uses a lot of clichés to built a positive and unrealistic happy ending.While I really enjoyed the film for some of its situations (especially the one involving Ben Affleck and Jennifer Aniston), I need to say that for the most of it it was something too much repetitive, nothing so refreshing and interesting to see that I haven't saw in another film, and by the way this kind of story works better in Woody Allen films, Ken Kwapis is not the right man for the job. And Allen knows how to balance romance, drama, tragedy and comedy altogether (watch ""Hannah and Her Sisters"" and you'll see what I'm talking about).The film opted to create countless unrealistic moments throughout most of its time, and since this was supposed to be one of those films that could make you change your point of view on love, dates and these things - since we're involved by this realistic thematic on why guys are not so into girls - that disappointed me a little, by becoming a almost fairy tale placed in the 21st century with a moral about how things work in life. The movie is a whole paradox, real and unreal at the same time just like life and that's why it might work for many viewers; to me it worked a bit, and once again in this matters of heart and emotion I'm still gonna think that the biggest secret of a successful love relationship is to not have a secret at all, you gotta live to figure out how things work, the rule applied to one might not work to another person (I guess that's why the film tried to tell me when Ginnifer Goodwin was explaining to Justin Long in a particular scene when they talk about exceptions and rules). But I'm glad that the story didn't gave happy endings to all the relationships presented here, there's in's and out's, lost and found, and complaints and angry feelings about smoking cigarettes being the worst thing that a man can do to his wife, even worst then have sex with another woman. If you're looking for the love of your life stop. If you're looking for some good answers to what love really means you can try here, perhaps you'll get some answers. If you want to see a great ensemble cast in good roles this movie is for you. Jennifer Aniston, Jennifer Connelly, Ben Affleck, Ginnifer Goodwin, Justin Long, Drew Barrymore, Bradley Cooper, Scarlett Johansson, Kevin Connolly are all the stars of this good film and their good as usual, nothing so outstanding or overshadowing each other, they are all equally great. I loved the reference on ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" (1987), that was a great comedy about the disillusions of love. Yeah, those teenagers had all figured it out! 6/10",He's Just Not That Into You
32,Floated2,Somewhat interesting stories but irritating characters,5,19 September 2010,"This film definitely has many clichés and stereotypes that are filled in romantic comedies this days.

'He's Just Not That Into You' is mostly a pointless, and somewhat insidious romantic comedy, which seems to have been written simply by taking a number of clichés about love and expanding them into dramatic segments that succeed in telling the audience precisely nothing they did not already know. Many stories seemed interesting and I enjoyed (Ginnifer Goodwins, Justin Long's, Kevin Connoly, Drew Marrymore's.

As for a rewatch (02/26/17'), my opinions and thoughts of this film have not chanced much as I remember certain moments about this film. 'He's Just Not That Into You' is merely a full length romantic- drama- comedy of 'Sex & the City' split into about four episodes. Many of the characters are dislikable which makes it more difficult to root for and to completely enjoy. The portrayals of most of the men characters in specific are more so looked upon as cheaters, cocky/selfish or non-confident. The film as a whole is not as funny as it should have been but there are enough top lists that does make the film slightly passable and entertaining within its moments. As another rewatch 08/11/18' the film remains the same, several decent storylines but also some unfunny and slightly uninteresting ones. Not a bad film, slightly above average, depending on the mood.",He's Just Not That Into You

I love her looks, her acting, well everything about her. So I decided to watch this movie with two girlfriends and I had a really good time.Some situations from the movie have happened to many women I know and that's why I thought the movie was really funny. You know, you don't have to take things very seriously.Jennifer Connelly delivers a fine, sexy, and to my surprise funny performance. Loved how she broke a glass or something and seconds later she picks the pieces up with her broom.Jennifer Aniston is very sexy as always and delivers the typical Jennifer Aniston performance, so you can go figure. It was fine.The rest of the cast is simply good because the plot doesn't ask for much.So fellow male viewers, take my advice. Watch this movie with your girlfriend and you will get more than you expect. But I would wait to rent it...",He's Just Not That Into You
34,Chris Knipp,He loves me; he loves me not...,6,8 February 2009,"This enjoyable ""woman's picture"" about judging relationships and finding the right (or most dependable) man is instructive, and skirts the fringes between TV's 'Sex and the City,' of which it's an offshoot, and a compendium of lighthearted how-to relationship advice, which Greg Behrendt and Liz Tuccillo's eponymous source book is. And the advice doesn't stop, even as the end credits roll.As a movie, it's an ensemble piece, and the actors, including Ben Affleck, Jennifer Aniston, Drew Barrymore, Jennifer Connolly, and Scarlett Johansson, whom you might or might not want to watch for two hours, work well together and are perfectly fine on screen only a few minutes at a time. A couple of them, Ginnifer Goodwin and Justin Long, have never been better or gotten such a good chance to show their skills. The great thing is that the screenplay doesn't strain to exaggerate anybody's traits for laughs, or turn maudlin, or go on long digressions about buying clothes. No plugs for Manolo Blahnik.At the center is the needy, but warm-hearted young woman called Gigi (Goodwin). A bit of the Cyrano thing happens. Perhaps Alex (Justin Long, very successful in his big role here), the jaded man who warns her to stop hoping when there's no hope, is not disinterested. She thinks every man's polite ""hope to see you again"" and proffered phone number mean something. Alex assures her they do not. She learns to give up dreams based on anecdotes about exceptions to this rule--those rare guys who had to be prodded, but then responded, or waited a year, yet returned to become the perfect mate.Two couple's stable relationships falter as the unattached guys and gals weave in and out of the scene in search of connection. Beth (Aniston) and Neil (Affleck) have lived together for seven years but Neil won't tie the knot. He says it's against his principles. After discussing this with her girlfriends, Beth forces the issue, which leads to Neil's moving out and camping on his sailboat. Aniston's real life personal history gives her sense of being dumped a subtext; but she's not really dumped. Ultimately Affleck shines as a classy guy with a genuine code of decency. They're the couple that carries the most conviction and they have the most touching moment.Janine (Connolly) is married to Ben (Bradley Cooper) and neurotically obsessing over the rehab of an old city row house. The picture is set in Baltimore and is true to the urban landscapes and night spots of Charm City. It also features some funny to-the-camera anecdotes by real ladies about men's tricks. Janine's also going wacko with suspicion that Ben is secretly smoking Amercan Spirit cigarettes on the rehab site, and lying to her that he's quit smoking for good. Then Ben meets voluptuous yoga instructor Anna (Johansson) at a supermarket checkout and though he takes a while to give in, it's lust at first sight. The pretext for their being connected at first is his helping her with her singing career. As in Vicky, Cristina, she's really just an oversexed young woman ""finding herself,"" and when the story ends, she's planning a wander-year in India. She's a slut, but both Ben and Janine have goofed as spouses and Anna is only the catalyst of their marital meltdown.Running through the piece is Gigi's relationship with Alex, who runs a big bar called the City Club and first meets her when she's had a date with a real estate agent called Conor (Kevin Connolly). Gigi thinks Conor is interested; Alex assures her he is not. Gigi keeps calling on Alex for tips on her various dates. Reading the signals doesn't come easy for her and Alex is always ready with the advice. One key item: ""spark"" or its lack don't mean anything. They're just male inventions to justify fickleness.Conor sold Janine and Ben the house they're rehabbing, which makes him seem reliable. Low and behold, he turns out to be a sex buddy and longtime pal of Anna, and to hanker for more with her. But Anna is busy getting crazy with Ben. Conor is looking for gay customers for these downtown rehabs, so he runs an ad in the 'Blade' via Mary (Drew Barrymore). Mary's gay cohorts at the 'Blade' also offer advice; she's not unlike Gigi in her men problems. Two gays assert that they can't give straights advice, because the signals among gay men are completely different, and much more rapidly understood. ""I want you"" or ""I don't"" is about the size of it.That six characters wind up happy is tilting the odds heavily to the upside: that's Hollywood. As one fellow audience member said going out, ""I'm glad it had a happy ending, because it was getting depressing for a while there."" Yes, and relationships are a messy business, which the two couples' troubles and the movie's whole middle section show. A lot of them don't end in happiness. The movie only offers hope and realism. It provides a little advice about commitment, judging a partner, and evaluating the first date. It doesn't consider all the factors that make for love or a good relationship.But the very qualities that keep this from being a great movie, it's lack of depth and failure to be witty, make it valid and honest as a look at dating and relationship-forming and save it from the utter mediocrity or bad taste it could have fallen into. Jane Austen or even 'Sex and the City' it's not. But it's also not an endless self-centered monologue but a sensible guide to wising up.Boring elements are the obligatory, but unnecessary, glossy American-movie wedding, complete with boorish speech by a relative. The picture steers clear of even more boring specifics of nowhere dates except for a man, appropriately appearing at that wedding, who attempts to woo poor Gigi by lecturing her on his career as a male witch.",He's Just Not That Into You
35,PWNYCNY,Innocuous.,6,18 February 2009,"A weak story coupled with an uninspiring script and forgettable acting marks this disappointing attempt to portray the joys and pitfalls of contemporary male-female relationships. The main problem with this movie is that whenever something dramatic is about to happen, the director pulls back, completely diffusing the tension, as if the movie was meant not to offend, which it does not. The main character is a 20s something young lady suffering from low self esteem and around her revolve sub-plots involving other innocuous people seeking that special someone. Even the scenes of marital infidelity are played down to the point that they lose all dramatic punch. It's too bad because the movie had potential to make some substantive statements about contemporary relationships but potential is not the same as action as this movie so aptly shows.",He's Just Not That Into You
36,meeza,I'm into this!,9,18 February 2009,"It apparently seems that many filmgoers are that much into the romantic comedy ""He's Just Not That Into You"" as it has made a good chunk of change in the box office so far. However, it also seems that many film critics are just not that into ""He's Just Not That Into You"" as it has received mostly negative reviews from the critico circles. I am a professional film-goer and an amateur critic, so I am going to where my expertise lies and favor the film-goer response and state that I am also that much into ""He's Just Not That Into You"". Dizzy? This vastly enjoyable romantic comedy is about a tangled web of romantic relationships in today's social landscaping playground. Therefore, let's log into the ""He's Just Not That Into You"" love wide web! Here we go! Ginnifer Goodwin plays Gigi, a perky romantic who is obsessed in finding Mr. Right. She first longs for Conor, a noble real estate agent portrayed by Kevin Connolly. Conor is roommates with Alex, a semi-arrogant bar manager acted by Justin Long. Gigi befriends Alex and he becomes her Love Guru on romantic advice. Gigi works with Beth and Janine played respectively by some hottie Jenns- Jennifer Aniston & Jennifer Connelly. Beth craves to marry her 7-year running steady beau Neil portrayed by Ben Affleck. Neil has an intense case of marryphobia which did not inflict his best friend, the married Ben portrayed by Bradley Cooper. Ben is married to Janine (see above, if you are lost) but he is tempted to ""adulterize"" (millennium word) with the voluptuous Anna played by the voluptuous Scarlett Johansson. Caught up in the middle of this love maze is Mary (Drew Barrymore), a writer for a gay magazine who is a constant victim of T.R.D. (technological relationship dumping; millennium acronym). Director Ken Kwapis' last directorial effort was the disastrous ""License To Wed"" which is probably the worst film I have ever seen. So I was pleasantly surprised that Mr. Kwapis was el papi with his creative film designation in directing ""He's Just Not That Into You"". Now he has earned a ""License To Direct"". Kwapis excels in exhibiting the film's characters with romantic phobias, insecurities, procrastinations, and obsessions that cause a relatable effect on its viewers. ""He's Just Not That Into You"" is not all about that he's just not that into you, is on the quest for modern love in the contemporary era and its open ended conclusion gives it that much more authenticity. None of the acting performances failed here but the one that passed with flying colors was the titillating work of Scarlett Johansson's bosoms. Le Kidding!!!! The standouts here (besides Scarlett's jewels, lol) were Jennifer Aniston, Ben Affleck, and Ginnifer Goodwin; especially Goodwin. Her Gigi was the love machine of ""He's Just Not That Into You"". Ms. Goodwin's breakthrough role here might be the gateway of some goodwins in her acting future. Screenwriters Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein's delectable scribe of romantic complexity was overdramatized at times but juicily entertaining. ""He's Just Not That Into You"" is not a poignant love life lesson, but who cares? Most people are not that much into that anymore!

37,MBunge,"A little shallow, but better than the average rom-com.",6,21 September 2010,"He's Just Not That Into You has one plot thread that puts a nice twist on the traditional romantic comedy story, another that doesn't quite seem to know what its point is, two more that don't seem to appreciate that sometimes people are just mean and a final plot threat that seems to exist because one of the executive producers also wanted some time on screen. That may not sound all that promising but for a film that tries to turn a dating self-help book for women into a romantic comedy, this movie is surprisingly good.The story focuses on the romantic entanglements of a loosely connected series of acquaintances. Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin) is a lovelorn young woman who doesn't understand why guys seem so nice on a first date and then never call her again. She is co-worker and friends with Beth (Jennifer Aniston), who's spent 7 years dating a man who never wants to get married, and Beth's sister Janine (Jennifer Connelly), whose seemingly happy marriage is actually teetering on the edge of disaster. Janine's husband Ben (Bradley Cooper) has become infatuated with the young and beautiful Anna (Scarlett Johansson). Anna, for her part, has been engaged in a sort-of relationship with Conor (Kevin Connolly) where she used to sleep with him but now treats him more like a gay best friend.Conor is completely smitten with Anna and splits his time obsessing over their dating status and going out with women like Gigi just to kill time. Gigi ends up turning to Alex (Justin Long), a cynical and emotionally detached bartender, who harshly educates Gigi on female delusions when it comes to men and romance. Meanwhile, Beth's boyfriend Neil (Ben Affleck) has little to do except be the perfect guy who just doesn't understand why his girlfriend wants to get married. And then there's Mary (Drew Barrymore), who only exists in the story to provide an excuse for snide commentary on dating protocol in the internet age and allow the movie to have more happy endings than sad ones.The heart of the movie is the relationship between Gigi and Alex, where he punctures her female pretensions about how men really think and feel about women. It's kind of a Ben Kenobi/Luke Skywalker relationship where Gigi gets her eyes opened to a larger world. Yet, after spending almost the entire movie reinforcing the idea that guys don't play games or send signals to women about how they feel, the story completely reverses that message and says guys do send signals but are simply unaware of them. I'm not sure what the point of that is.Ginnifer Goodwin is absolutely adorable as a woman who wants so badly to love and be loved. Kevin Connolly is also very cute as a guy who's fretting over a girl and the nature of their relationship like a stereotypical chick. Jennifer Aniston is very beautiful and anyone who's seen The Good Girl knows she can act, but she's hugely hampered in this movie by her own romantic history. It's really impossible to see past Aniston's personal travails with marriage and dating and connect with Beth as a character.The other actors are all fairly good but their characters are undermined to one extent or another by the story's viewpoint that romantic problems are caused by people not being honest with themselves and others about what they want. That's certainly true to some extent, but it's equally true that people know what they want and hurt the ones who love them by being selfish or too afraid to go after what they genuinely desire. That means the characters, particularly Anna and Ben, are never allowed to engage in any truly negative behavior or feelings. In trying to be non-judgmental about these people and their situations, the movie ends up robbing them of any emotional depth.While most of the humor is as shallow as its characters, there's a decent amount of laughs in He's Just Not That Into You. There are even a couple of flashes of dark comedy and the film comes up with a phrase, ""gay adjacent"", that should definitely be adopted by same sex marriage proponents.This film won't stir the same sentiments in you as a traditionally good romantic comedy, but it also avoids falling into the same, stultifying rhythm and clichéd cadence that make bad rom-coms such a chore to sit through. It mostly puts the responsibility for romantic difficulty on women, so your own relationship status might determine how much you enjoy it.",He's Just Not That Into You
38,MaxBorg89,It all started with a catchphrase...,7,27 March 2009,"Ken Kwapis' latest directorial achievement, He's Just Not That Into You, is based on a book. Nothing unusual so far. Said book, however, derives from the most unexpected source of all: a line spoken in an episode of Sex and the City, more specifically in Season Six when Miranda wondered why a guy hadn't called her yet and Berger (Ron Livingston) explained that the man in question just wasn't that into her. This kind of origin suggests the movie will be a PG-13 version of the cult series, and it does come dangerously close to being just that.Not that there aren't some differences. For starters, the film is set in Baltimore, not New York. Also, instead of four women occupying every scene we have five girls and four guys sharing the screen more or less equally. The story is set in motion by Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin), so naive she can't tell her date Conor (Kevin Connolly) is dying to call another woman, Anna (Scarlett Johansson) as soon as possible. Anna, on the other hand, is busy flirting with Ben (Bradley Cooper), who's married to Gigi's sister Janine (Jennifer Connelly). The two sisters also have a colleague, Beth (Jennifer Aniston), who's upset because Neil (Ben Affleck), her boyfriend of seven years, hates the idea of getting married. And oh yeah, Anna has a friend named Mary (Drew Barrymore, who also serves as an executive producer), whose specialty is getting picked up - and dumped - on MySpace and similar rubbish, and there's a dude called Alex (Justin Long) who, like Berger before him, gives advice to women who need it (i.e. Gigi).Now, let's see: various sentimental problems? Check. Occasional interruptions in the narrative where people will comment on their situation by talking directly to the camera? Check. Not-so-subtle critique of today's postmodern world, specifically computers and other technologies that intend to simplify but actually end up complicating things? Check. Loads of mock-philosophical, yet hilarious conclusions about love and men? Check. This could easily have been an extended episode of Sex and the City (minus the swearing and most of the sex), which doesn't sound so strange if one considers the fact that the book's authors worked on the show. Like Darren Star's masterpiece, it's a comedy that ostensibly appeals to certain women but ultimately has enough wit (and sexy female presence) to attract men as well. The main downside is that the same stories have been told many times before.And yet He's Just Not That Into You is funnier than it should be, partly because, déjà vu or not, the dialogue has enough punch, partly because it dares to go into darker territory without making it look contrived (which was a bit of a problem in the Sex and the City film), but mostly because, Ginnifer Goodwin aside, the actors are just too darn fun to watch. This is one of those times where it's perfectly acceptable to say that Ben Affleck is one of the best reasons to watch the movie.So no, it's not the Altman version of a romantic comedy. But it isn't another tired Sex and the City rehash, either. It's good, harmless fun that is guaranteed to entertain for two hours.",He's Just Not That Into You
39,juneebuggy,Addictive but forgettable chick-flick revolving around (mostly neurotic) 20 and 30-somethings navigating their way through various relationships.,5,26 October 2014,"I generally like these types of movies with interconnected stories and a whose-who cast although I have seen better in ""Valentines Day"" and ""Love Actually.""Decent ensemble here but most of the women are freakin nuts and I found them frustrating to watch especially Ginnifer Goodwin, sitting by the phone, making desperate excuses for loser men. When did the purpose of life become solely about finding a man? This is the message that Sex & The City puts out there too, Why? Jennifer Connelly was also painful, as a control freak with a cheating husband (Bradley Cooper). -I'd cheat with Scarlett Johansson too though. Justin Long seemed miscast as the womanizing bartender and would have done better if he'd exchanged roles with Kevin Connelly, the needy real estate agent. Ben Affleck has a smaller role, playing the commitment-phobe good guy and Jennifer Aniston goes about her usual ""Rachelness"" managing to look fantastic in a pair of jeans but still be a big loser where love is concerned.

40,davispittman,I'm not all that into this movie......,5,26 November 2015,"I guess I was just expecting more from this romantic comedy. The actor's performances were actually all pretty good, including Jennifer Aniston's and Ben Affleck's. Ben and Jennifer's segment of the film was by far my favorite part. Also, we have Bradley cooper and Scarlett Johanson........ Their portion of the movie was very weary and annoying, both of their characters in general were both very irritating. I enjoyed Ginnifer Goodwin in this movie a whole lot, her character was very sweet and somewhat ignorant, very pleasant character. Drew Barrymore has a small role in it, and she delivers well, I enjoyed seeing her. This movie really suffers from too many bland unfunny scenes. It also suffers from certain characters, not all, but certain ones making annoying stupid decisions throughout. At least they end up getting exactly what they deserve. The film's dialogue is kinda mediocre. The movie as a whole is a 5/10.",He's Just Not That Into You
41,EUyeshima,By-the-Numbers Ensemble Piece Focusing on Foibles in Dating and Longer Lasting Relationships,6,22 June 2009,"I think director Ken Kwapis and co-screenwriters Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein are trying to make a comic Shakespearean roundelay out of the best-selling 2004 self-help book by Greg Behrendt and Liz Tuccillo, but this soapish 2009 comedy never quite takes flight because of the predictable nature of the multiple story lines. At 129 minutes, it also runs way too long given its singular focus on the romantic predicaments of the nine principals in the cast. Not too surprisingly, the whole venture feels like an extended episode of ""Sex and the City"" with well-known actors who appear to have divergent takes on what the movie is really about. There are four separate story lines to track, and they're all tethered to Gigi, an emotionally insecure twenty-something who takes her shallow bar conversations with men so seriously that she constantly waits for them to follow up. She had high hopes for Conor, a real estate agent who never calls her back, but she then finds an unexpected dating coach in his best friend Alex, a promiscuous bar owner who cynically teaches her how to read the signs of non-interest.Meanwhile, Janine, one of Gigi's co-workers, feels something is going awry in her marriage to Ben as she busies herself renovating their home. He accidentally meets comely yoga instructor and aspiring singer Anna at the local supermarket, and they embark on a clandestine affair against their better judgment. Gigi's other co-worker Beth has been living monogamously with Neil, a photographer, for seven years, and marriage doesn't appear in the cards. They break up due to his lack of desire to get married, but a near-tragedy at Beth's younger sister's wedding makes them reconsider their relationship. Providing a full circle to the film's structure, the fourth plot has Anna rebuffing the serious overtures of an enamored Conor as she considers her situation with Ben, while her friend Mary, a newspaper editor who faces a similar predicament as Gigi, finds a connection with Conor when he starts advertising his business in her paper.It's really the pat treatment of the intertwining characters that trivializes the movie into something just a little deeper than a TV commercial. Had there been more focus on one of the stories, say Gigi and Alex's, with the rest relegated to minor subplots, then the movie could have possibly resonated more. The cast is certainly attractive enough, but I wouldn't say they are ideally compatible as an ensemble. Ginnifer Goodwin (the youngest wife on HBO's ""Big Love"") has to play up Gigi's eager nervousness at such an excitable level that her neediness starts to feel too one-note. As lothario-in-love Alex, Justin Long (yes, the Apple guy) seems miscast in a swinger role that would have been a better fit for Bradley Cooper (""The Hangover""), who plays Ben. Even more, the friends-to-lovers relationship between him and Goodwin never feels quite authentic enough to sustain the story arc it needs to support. Initially, it was nice to see Jennifer Connelly (""A Beautiful Mind"") in a lighter role than her usual sturm und drang, but as Janine recognizes her husband's adultery, she bears the burden of the film's most dramatic episode.As Ben, Cooper is merely called upon to look guilty for most of his screen time, that is, when he is not being seduced by the sultry charms of Scarlett Johansson as Anna. After her work for Woody Allen, she seems particularly on automatic pilot here and not very challenged by the role. Kevin Connolly (HBO's ""Entourage"") plays Conor in a way that forces him to waver between boyish and selfish. Perhaps due to their tabloid overexposure, Jennifer Aniston and Ben Affleck at first don't seem to mesh well with the others, but as the story progresses, both turn in surprisingly sympathetic work as Beth and Neil. Rounding out the cast is executive producer Drew Barrymore, who plays Mary as a comic wallflower confused by the complicated impact of communications technology on dating. The 2009 DVD is fairly bare-bones containing both the widescreen and full-screen versions of the film. There is a handful of deleted scenes with optional commentary from Kwapis, although it seems like a surprising omission not to have his insights included on an optional commentary track for the film itself.",He's Just Not That Into You
42,jaybob,I was not into any the goings on here.,6,4 August 2009,"This ensemble movie has a large cast. This film is from Warner Bros, When I first started watching films from this studio,the beginning credits would say who is playing who with a picture of the performer.I sure could of used that here,mainly for the male cast members,I knew the names but not the faces. I did recognize many of the ladies however..This movie has some gay characters, BUT none of the various relationships involve any of them, It may have been a better film if at least one relationship were gay oriented.I can understand the title clearer now after seeing this not very funny comedy. I, personally would not be interested in any of the female characters, especially the lead. Ginnifer Goodwin is a good actress & quite pretty, I do not care for any overly demanding, possessive persons,male or female. However,she did convey this feeling very well. To a lesser degree, Scarlett Johansen,Jennifer Connelly & Jennifer Anniston were as annoying as the other female leads.The guys came over better (I just would like to know who was who, they all are from TV shows & I just am not a Television viewer.These nice guys are well portrayed by Justin Long,Bradley Cooper &.Kevin Connally. Ben Affleck,Drew Barrymore & Kris Kristophrson have good cameos.The director (also from TV) is Ken Kewpis,He did an acceptable job is shepherding this large cast. The screenplay was written by Abby Kohn & Marc Silverstien & it was taken from books by Greg Behrendt & Liz Tucciloo.This is a long film 129 minutes BUT it does move smoothly, Teresa Russell had a cameo role BUT due to time elements her part was taken out. You can however see her scenes in the deleted scene section of the DVD.If the ladies were more likable I would have given this a higher rating.Ratings **1/2 (out of 4) 74 points (out of 100) IMDb 6 (out of 10)",He's Just Not That Into You

In fact, since childhood we are set up to misinterpret each other signals, hoping when hope is lost, waiting forever for a call that doesn't come. But we doesn't give up do we? Try, and try again.Comments: A successful, fun and very entertaining relationship comedy, told mostly from the viewpoint of Gigi, but it is about at least seven other characters can be considered lead characters that share screen time. Big cast ensembles can be tricky as it might be hard to have to relate to them all, but that is not a problem here. First of all, the issue at hand is something we all recognize more or less, and secondly all characters know or are connected to each other in some way or another. Their different story lines intertwine and cross paths and no character is far from the action, even if the character is not on the screen.The story is written in a witty and a humoristic way, and is the key to the success of the movie. It is fun and fast paced, twisting and developing. It is not very complex, but intelligent none the less. Simply put, it is very entertaining.7/10",He's Just Not That Into You

The verdict is still up in air with this, somebody call the jury back in. This mess of a movie was very predictable, very stoic, lazily adapted and quite annoying if you're not watching because you're a fan of one or a few of the all-star cast members. It all came off as more about the stars in it rather than the story about the ups and downs of relationships. Don't waste your time if you don't have too watch this film, I was suckered in because I'm a fan of Drew Barrymore.

45,Galina_movie_fan,I won't have what they were having.,3,27 December 2011,"After an hour or so into He's Just Not That Into You and I found that I was not that into it because it was boring, pretentious, clichéd ad nauseam and insulting to both female and male audiences. The movie is populated with the pathetic women who just talk and talk about their relationships or the lack of them, and are needy, desperate, and super-annoying. Infantile men, scary of commitments or those who are in the relationship but could not remember why they actually wanted to be in one. Plus, it has nothing to do with the comedies. It is totally not funny and anti-romantic. Just imagine Sex and the City with no sex, Love, actually with NO Love at all, actually, and When Harry Met Sally with the main characters absolutely unlikable and lifeless. I finished watching the whole thing hoping that it would improve and give me something to like in it. The only story that I found a notch better than the rest was that of Neil and Beth (Jennifer Anniston and Ben Affleck), who have been together for seven years, love each other but are not married because Neil does not believe in marriage. Both actors were convincing in the story that was not as annoying as the rest of them.But for the most of the time, I was not into the movie's characters at all. I read the plot of the movie in Wiki and in writing it does not look as irritating and boring as the film. Then I found out that the film was based on the bestselling book by two Sex and the City scribes (that explains the similarities between two), Greg Behrendt and Liz Tuccillo. I read some of it and liked it a lot. So, what went wrong with the movie? Were the actors trying too much) or 2+ hours running time was way too long? As the result, the movie is simply lifeless and plain with no sparks or romance, and, sadly, even the all-stars cast could not save it.",He's Just Not That Into You

Yeah, I know, another Chick Flick that may become the Mother of all Chick Flicks. I hesitated in taking out this DVD, but there is nothing else out there. All the movies you want to see are being held back from DVDs until Christmas time. I mean where is Star Trek, the new one? Huh?High school does pay off as witnessed by this movie. Everything we have ever done and not done was first done and not done in High School. So..someone found a way to capitalize on those precious moments. Well, they were precious back then, not now. We get a lot of ""does he/she like me? Go find out without letting him/her know it's me asking."" ""Should I wait for him/her to call or should I call?"" See what I mean? This is the whole movie. You will not find any real wisdom in here,as the many pearls of wisdom (the advice given/replies) given are full of holes. Soooooooory, you'll just have to muddle along like everyone else. There is also one married couple and one unmarried couple and the expected happens in both instances. One doesn't believe in marriage, one does, and one gets tempted and one gets suspicious. Do you need the details? I thought not.The acting all around is good for this talk-fest, but let's face it Jennifer Aniston will forever be known as Forever Rachael, and she's good at it and really, I don't mind. I liked Rachael in the TV show Friends. We all did. Some of her earlier movies suggested she may be breaking out. Now, she's breaking back in. Ah, she knows we all like Rachael too. Whata gal!Why did I take this DVD out? Why Scarlett Johansson, of course, and yes because of Forever Rachael too. The rest of the story, ah, who cares? Too talky and I lost many threads that didn't really matter anyway. There were some good lines in the beginning, but then they faded away like most comedies these days. A few LOLs in the beginning and thennothing memorable. Go back to your High School Days and there you can figure out the threads you couldn't figure out in here.Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes, one F-bomb by Forever Rachael.

It's not a funny film and it's not that romantic.All it is is all of these A-list actors playing people either having affairs or breaking up or looking for love. The women in the film are really desperate and it's kind of sad in a way. The movie is also sexist against men because it makes us look like total a**holes. All of the situations in the film are way to real, and that's another thing I disliked. The film seemed too real so it was like a romantic drama. It's based on a self-help book.

The next stages (marriage, sleeping) are still unknown territories for me but as the movie says, hope must always be present.I think the cast was really great to personalize all the difference levels in relationship and they explain how can i could become so easily win over. Strangely, it's the unknown couple and not those of Hollywood stars, that i liked the most.For those who want a sequel, at least in books, you could read ""IT'S CALLED A BREAKUP BECAUSE IT'S BROKEN"" because it's the help for those who did follow blindly their passion.

53,jaredmobarak,You're my exception ... He's Just Not That Into You,7,24 February 2009,"Longtime television director, and top dog of some movies I'm sure he'd like to forget about, Ken Kwapis' new film He's Just Not That Into You seemed to be that rare romantic comedy that offered enough plot and insight to interest both sexes. All about a group of guys and girls in their late twenties to late thirtieswho are, in the most convenient way, connected to each other by someone in the groupit shows their successes and failures at love. Based on a popular novel, I'd be interested to know if they all held these connections there too, or if characters were combined and moved around for ease at adapting. Either way, it does work, as long as you forget that whole unwritten rule about dating your best friend's ex. That rule surely doesn't apply here, and really, why should it at all? If the film shows us anything, it's that we find love in strange and unusual places, oftentimes discovering it when you least expect it.Mostly showcasing a new rising crop of performers like Ginnifer Goodwin, Justin Long, Bradley Cooper, and Kevin Connolly coming into their own as stars, the addition of stalwarts Jennifer Connelly, Ben Affleck, and Jennifer Aniston help support it. What it all comes down to is the fact that they all pretty much become their character. I never started thinking about Ben and Jen, but instead Neil and Beth, because each actor has such an ensemble role to play that no one ever steals the spotlight  the true star is the story and the heartbreaking reality that you can relate to each and every one of them. So many cringe-worthy moments accompany the laughter at how true it all is; the cast puts it all on the table nakedly for you to relive every relationship you've had and the absolutely crazy things your friends have said to help you through it.If I were to single out any one character as the ""star"", it would be Goodwin's Gigi. This girl is the most outrageous stereotype there could be, yet, while I hated her idiocy in the trailer, I grew to really like her innocence and honesty. Always making the wrong move, always being that crazy stalker girl, she never showed fear at putting herself out there to crash and burn. You have to respect that. Gigi is at the middle of the action, co-worker and friend with Connelly and Aniston while also delving into the world of Long's bar-owner Alex and his womanizing ways. The more subtle trials and tribulations occur around her front-and-center shenanigans, which, while seemingly a continuous series of brain farts, will most likely be all too close for comfort with your own memories. Goodwin has the angelic naivete to pull it off though. She is both needy and trusting, yet loving despite all the pain she experiencesever optimistic about life. Sometimes you want to slap her in the face and wake her to reality, but at the same time you hope she finally finds the right guy.As far as that slap in the face, though, Justin Long is my favorite part of the movie. He knows what kind of guy he is and he knows all the tricks and games both sides play. His candidness with Gigi is refreshingly honest and pulls back the curtain of the man's playbook of dating. I mean, really, if a guy isn't calling, he's not interested; sometimes you just have to move on and realize that if he didn't want you, why should you want him? It is a moment like him telling Gigi to run from a date while she calls him from the bathroom because he said he'd be going out of town. Long's insight is spot-on and the hesitation from the date when asked where he is going is priceless. But even the mighty must fall at some point. Numb to the powers of love for so long, even the one with all the answers sometimes needs to be slapped back to reality so he can see what's right in front of him.All the story lines have some redeemable qualities as you watch and remember the times you were in the same situation. From Connelly's driven-to-be-married wife that becomes more mother than lover; to Bradley Cooper's guilted husband that wants out but is too afraid to leave, (honestly, him telling his wife he cheated on her was not brave as she later says, it's the complete opposite, delving into cowardice so that she can slap him and leave, thus allowing him to not be the one to end it, despite the fact he cheated); to Connolly's used soul strung along by the woman he loves because she knows he'll be there when she needs him although she has never, ever been there for him; to the true love between Affleck and Aniston despite them being together for seven years and not engaged. Honestly, if you are committed to each other why must you prove it to the world with a giant spectacle? However, the opposite holds true as well since how hard is it to just make it legal and not care in order to be with the woman you love? Their story was my favorite, yet its conclusion left a lot to be desired.In the end, I really enjoyed my time in this worldespecially viewing with two girls that kept laughing at moments they related to both being involved in with each other before; that shows how universal the problems and successes are. Even the short fourth wall-breaking documents that follow each ""chapter heading"" hold relevance along with levity. There is a lot of truth in He's Just Not That Into You, but I'm sure, even if you watch and realize the errors of your ways, you'll still do the same things over again.

54,vitaleralphlouis,Funny as a broken leg.......,1,6 June 2009,"This agenda-driven movie is populated with enough homosexuals to sink a ship, but they forgot to include any lesbians. So it fails as a gay agenda movie. Set in Baltimore, they do the diversity agenda thing by including one of just about any ethnic group, but they forgot the Eskimos. Thus the diversity agenda sinks. The 3rd agenda is entertainment. That sinks because their main concerns were with gays and ethnics. Guess what? In Baltimore they have lots and lots of ethnic groups. Like most places, they interact; but they also like their own kind, so they don't mix it up to suit the Diversity Agenda. It's called ""Living."" The only thing gays have to do with heterosexual dating is they are sometimes mistaken for straights. They do not just hang around with a drink and watch hetro mating.None of the characters and situations are based on real people, so the humor is false and flat. We watched this on DVD on a Saturday.

I love movies that have many stars and then they all connect throughout the movie. Each actor/actress did a wonderful job at playing their parts and had terrific chemistry with each other. The story showed that relationships don't always work out the way you want them to. It shows the bad parts of relationships but also the amazing parts. And there are definitely parts where I cringed because of how awkward a situation was. It made the movie more realistic to real life. However, it did find a way to fix the parts that were awkward.

Of the four, only the cartoon CORALINE really met basic expectations (though PINK PANTHER 2 got rated as high as it did because how much more could people expect after seeing Steve Martin's first PINK PANTHER flick?). The ""6"" for PUSH was the most overly generous of these scores (you can see the rest of my thoughts on my ""comment"" for that movie), while HE'S JUST NOT . . . was really pushing an ""8"" in my book, if it just had been a tad shorter (two hours, nine minutes for an ensemble romcom?! C'mon!) and more focused and/or funnier, a la FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL (even funny nudity could have helped--what's with this sudden spate of PG13 sex farces, action flicks, and--gasp!--horror movies: most of the people I see at the movies not only are over 12--they're over 17!). What HE'S JUST NOT . . . has going for it is that it sort of picks up steam (though at least 20 minutes could have been cut; e.g., it's not necessary to spend six scenes establishing that Janine--Jennifer Connelly--is an OCD control freak), and not EVERYONE ends up in a simplistic two-by-two pairing aping the animals entering Noah's Ark (Janine, Anna--Scarlett Johansson, and Ben--Bradley Cooper, are all solo at last report). On the other hand, womanizing bar manager Alex (Justin Long) and clueless realtor Connor (Kevin Connolly) both implausibly seem to wind up with better than they deserve. If the characters played by Ben Affleck, Jennifer Aniston, and Kristopher Kristofferson--to name three--were left on the cutting room floor, this film coulda been an ""8"" (if not a contender).",He's Just Not That Into You

58,LazySod,Love and other morbidity's,5,22 June 2009,"Love is battlefield. Pat Bennetar sung about it, defined its ugly head. This film plays it. Love in its various tastes, lived by various people. Some of them meeting up in the middle, some of them never seeing each other. The film plays a bit like a lesson in life: in a Q&A form it poses a number of questions and answers them. The chapters add up together like a solid book and most of them are played out interesting enough. Some of them miss a bit of a pace though and not all the things that happen between the people are matching enough.The film is not uninteresting but it could have done some better if it hadn't made some of the easy cliché choices it made now.

59,jordan2240,Are we really that bad?,8,7 February 2009,"My girlfriend and I, both at or approaching our 50's, saw this in a theater that was absolutely filled with high school girls. That surprised me actually, given that most of the stars in this film are well-beyond high-school age. But they, like the rest of the audience, seemed to really enjoy this film, as did we. The relationships were nicely intertwined without being contrived (""Crash"" anyone?), and unlike the similar movie ""Love Actually,"" nothing portrayed was too outlandish. The convention of adding comments by ""real"" people to introduce story lines was well done and amusing. If I find any fault with the film, it's that all of the guys are presented as having relationship ""issues"" or as being total bone-heads. Hopefully there are more ""nice guys"" interspersed in society than what this film might lead you to believe (though I must say that the attitudes presented are definitely not inaccurate).Overall, a very nice film whose 2 hour plus running time goes by rather quickly. If you've ever been in or tried to be in a relationship, you'll probably enjoy this movie.",He's Just Not That Into You
60,bbewnylorac,Pretty good rom com,7,15 February 2020,"While not the best rom com you will see, this movie does try to be more than a cute date flick. Despite there being about eight characters, all with their own stories, I found it easy to follow their different personalities and problems. I guess the point is to say how unpredictable people are, all with their own desires for a partner, and that we all have to work out what we really want, and how to get it. But the movie never gets bogged down in detail, and somehow it does stay quite light in tone. The heroine, Gigi, (Ginnifer Goodwin) starts off as a cute, ditzy office girl, but she winds up being rather heroic to me, putting herself out there in going on dates, and not letting a string of rejections quench her spirit. Her friend, bartender Alex (Justin Long), at first seems much more worldly and wise, but it turns out that he likes to stay away from risk by trying to act as matchmaker and adviser to Gigi. Long is understated but very appealing as Alex. The other actors - an excellent lineup including Jennifer Connolly, Bradley Cooper, Scarlett Johanson, Ben Affleck and Jennifer Aniston, are all great, with interesting storylines.",He's Just Not That Into You
61,diac228,"Meshing Sex and the City flavor with the complex storytelling structure of Crash, this chick flick rises above the norm with plenty of charm and realism",8,9 February 2009,"Love or hate Sex and the City, you cannot deny its impact on pop culture in terms of the way relationships are perceived, described, and displayed on television and film. Then with the movie installment, it becomes the highest-grossing romantic comedy since 2005 and also among the biggest of all-time. Clever writing, excellent casting, and the ability to pull no punches is the deadly combination that makes it a hit with viewers and critics as well (though, not so much with the movie). He's Just Not That Into You combines the same elements that makes Sex and the City such a success; except it contains even more heart than you'd expect, and a bit more unpredictability. Unlike Sex and the City, this film is much more believable, much more down-to-earth, more accessible, and overall a better look at the way love works. It definitely isn't perfect, but it's quite a shock as to how entertaining it can be.In a Crash sort of way, this movie intertwines and weaves together multiple plots that have loose connections with one another; yet ultimately follow the same themes of love and finding happiness. One involves a ditzy hopeless romantic by the name of Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin) receiving tips from a promiscuous bar manager (Justin Long), another one involves a long-lasting couple not yet married (Ben Affleck, Jennifer Aniston), a third tale involves a recently-married couple (Jennifer Connelly and Bradley Cooper) having complications because of outside temptation (Scarlett Johannson). Last but not least there's an advertising expert (Drew Barrymore) who is struggling to find somebody, anybody. Based off a book which is based off of a catchphrase from the ultra-popular Sex and the City show, this film at the core feels like a younger sister of the phenomenon.Romantic comedies rely heavily on two things: the writing, and the casting. The casting is definitely superb; we have several Golden Globe and Academy Award-winners and nominees on the front end (Ben Affleck, Connelly, Johannson) and many wonderful up-and-coming stars contributing (Long, Goodwin, Cooper). They all play off each other very well and add to the realism of the entire peace. None of them are heavily infused with makeup and look like they are in an eternal fashion runway show (Like..well, you should know by now). The writing duo of Abby Kohn and Mark Silverstein had a tough job of translating a rather deep and complex story into a film but nonetheless stripped the bare essentials, good dialogue, and did a better job keeping the plots tightly wound when compared to other films in similar fashion (Shut up ""Crash"" fans, that movie was a writing disaster).Chick flicks have gotten a bad reputation because of its ability to dwell into every single type of stereotype imaginable. He's Just Not That Into You follows the trend loosely, but then destroys it by throwing in a lot of plot twists, turns, and unexpected surprises. While all the stories have been done before, the manners in which they continue and end vary quite drastically from the norm. This is a refreshing aspect of the movie, just like love you're not sure what to expect. Finally, there are the little breaks in between the tales; you'll see interviews of other random people discussing love and the opposite sex. Ken Kwapis directs with limited pizazz and style, as he presents the story with decent pacing and enough stability to keep you entertained in the rather lengthy running time.Bottom Line: Neglect what the critics have said, they all usually hate chick flicks in general (Mostly male too, how's that for a coincidence?). Being the counterculture expert that enjoys destroying trends and normal thinking on a daily basis, I can tell you that this is a good movie with great acting, good writing, and an overall semi-realistic and good view on love and its inability to have a set course. Depending on your personality, you may prefer one story over another (also depends on your current relationship status). This is Sex and the City at heart; just missing the fashion, the explicit sex dialogue, nudity, and higher-class aura.The down-to-earth behavior and nature of this film however allows for it to be more believable and much more personal than let's say the problems and issues of four highly-successful and well-paid independent women. While there isn't as much comedy as one would hope, its still sprinkled throughout and the characters themselves are (for the most part) lovable enough to maintain your interest as you ponder what happens next. Recommend, whether you are single, taken, married, divorced, or have a fondness for creatures from another planet.P.S. Men, if you are still looking for a reason to see this movie, picture a seductive and promiscuous Scarlett Johannson for two hours. You can thank me later.",He's Just Not That Into You
62,Otoboke,Disorientating.,7,3 May 2009,"Relationships and to a lesser extent, love, can be tricky business. Not only is it something that can rarely be pinpointed to a clear definition from your average person indulging within such romantic relations, but the endless arrays of psychological and physical complications that can arise from one single fleeting spontaneous burst of eye contact are startling—and often overwhelming. And yet, despite the complexities and multi-faceted, shape-shifting facades that perpetuate this characteristically human trait, it could certainly be argued that no other side of the human condition attracts audiences to cinema houses moreso than that very conundrum. It is no surprise then that very often there is something of a deflating nature to most romantic movies in that they never truly touch upon such diverse and transient topics regarding romance; in fact, with the exception of a few key directors specialising in the genre, the romance and romantic comedy are often ones belittled with caricature and farce when put in contrast with the very broad reality to which they try to depict.He's Just Not That Into You is something of a blessing when taken back into this sense of perspective. While the feature certainly does fall victim to the genre's many trappings here and there—the sheer scale and complexity of the tale which it tells here is nothing short of compelling to watch play out. To its biggest credit then, the sole selling value to Kwapis' feature here is exactly this; and that is its ability to depict romance and love in a realistic, but nevertheless engaging and larger than life light. It may not be profound, and it may not offer the best slice of cinematic catharsis to grace silver screens; but what is does do is offer a handful of tangible characters that intertwine with each other's lives in a Love Actually manner without branching off into awkward parody. Taking a step back and glancing at the lives of those on-screen manages to strike simultaneous feelings of pity, joy and pathos. From the multi-layered levels of each of the character's personas, to the equally contorted nature of their relations, He's Just Not That Into You can be an overwhelming experience for sure, but one gets the feeling that that's the very point.Indeed, love can be disorientating—that's the nature of it; it's what attracts us to the often whimsical fleeting nature of its elusive and enigmatic presence. Of course, you could attest to its ""moth to the flame"" elements, but then it goes without saying that to every rusted coin there lays two sides both equally likely to land face-up. It's this somewhat balanced, dynamic and equally opposed side of He's Just Not That Into You that gives it its edge against the usual romantic comedy fare. Sure, there are moments to the story here that feel overly contrived, sickly and just a little too fairy-tale catered, but for the majority of the feature's admittedly overlong runtime, the rewards end up far outweighing the momentary slips and low points.Where the movie does tend to slip up more substantially however is in delivering two things; romance, and comedy. Okay, so wait a minute—A romantic comedy that fails in those areas is sure to be a dud right? Well, yes. Except, He's Just Not That Into You isn't really a rom-com. In fact, it's more of a drama laced with some sweet moments and some funny sequences that just happen to arise from the drama of everyday relations. In this vein, the feature succeeds; if taken on the level of a thesis with glimpses of human heart here and there, Kwapis hits the proverbial nail on the head. And yet, for quite a large portion of the film, that somewhat broadened idea of romance and comedy is inflicted upon us –sometimes naturally, and sometimes awkwardly. The result is a movie that tries to be something its not, and while it can be easy to look past such pretensions from time to time—there still exists a certain frustration inherent to the screenplay's reflectively neurotic nature.For what it's worth however; He's Just Not That Into You really is a catch—it just doesn't know it. It clings around you for two hours hanging onto your every word hoping to make a connection without realizing that it had you at the first act. So while it's disappointing that the feature never quite lives up to its potential, it can be a hard time denying the intellectual and sporadically arresting moments of pathos and heart that exists within the script's disjointed nature. Of course, some viewers won't be able to sit through what is essentially a two hour exploration and analysis of human behavior relating to romantic relations between persons, but if taken as only that beforehand the experience can be as rewarding for the head as it can be for the heart.A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)",He's Just Not That Into You

Here's my review.""He's Just Not That Into you"" is something a bit different based upon the hugely popular book. It's basically supposed to be like a little guide for girls to work out if the guy they are with is really keen on them or not.The movie follows a bunch of different people in very different relationships and opens them up to see what real love is. The main character is Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin, who is relatively new and has only appeared in one movie to poke fun at- ""Mona Lisa Smile""), a girl who is clueless when it comes to guys and comes across as way to desperate. She seeks guidance from a few of her friends (played by Jennifer Aniston and Jennifer Connelly), whose relationships we also delve into. Eventually she meets a much better source of counsel, bar owner Alex (played by the Mac guy), who tells her all the signals guys give off and helps her understand men better. There's a bunch of other stories featuring Ben Affleck, Drew Barrymore, Scarlett Johansson and others who feature in story lines about a girl who just meets guys online, a guy who cheats on his wife, a man who won't commit and more. Rather than spell it out, the movie throws up a bunch of situations and leaves us to decide what love is.Pretty ho-hum, helped by the quality of the cast (except Drew Barrymore, who's storyline was pathetic).

Most of the women, seemed to immensely enjoy this movie,at least from the reviews, even though I felt it was mocking women and caricatures of women in a most unflattering way.Just very degrading of females in general. I would hope that the ladies that like this movie do not identify with these ladies. It would be sad to think that they do. The acting performances were good . I truly felt that Kris Kristofferson, with his minor role as Jennifer Anistons dad, had the best acting performance of his life. Maybe not being a headliner helped his acting abilities , with not much pressure being the 8th batter in the line up. The film kept my interest but not much else.

69,Jerique,An entertaining funny movie for all!,8,10 February 2009,"Movie starts off with a prologue about how girls are given bad advice from their mothers when they are at a young age, telling them that boys pick on girls because they have a crush on them when it's obvious that ""He's Just Not That Into You."" We are introduced to Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin) who's on a date with Connor (Kevin Connolly). At the end of the date, Connor tells her ""it's nice to meet you"" but Gigi reads it as ""we'll get together again."" As they part ways, Gigi calls up her friend and Connor calls up Anna (Scarlett Johansson) but Gigi believes him to be calling her and leaving a message. Currently Anna is at the store where she wins a contest and flirts a bit with charming Ben (Bradley Cooper) who tells her that he's married and he can't take her number. Later in the film, audiences will learn that Ben's wife is Janine (Jennifer Connelly), who is friends with Gigi.Gigi meets Alex (Justin Long), Connor's roommate and sparks fly even though he becomes her confidant. Beth (Jennifer Aniston) is in a dead-end relationship with Ben's friend Neil (Ben Affleck) and Mary (Drew Barrymore) can't seem to find a date. At the end of the film, the relationships all align themselves properly, but along the way you get to see the obsessive characteristic of Gigi, the funny brutal honesty of Alex, the charming nice side of Ben and overall laugh till your butt falls off.The cast is just a long, long list of A-list actors/actresses. I was surprised to like Ben's character because so far I've seen Bradley Cooper in the villainous roles like Sack (Wedding Crashers) and Demo (Failure To Launch). In this role, he's likable because he's trying to resist Scarlett Johansson's character's advances and fails but he's still gotta be likable to the audience which in my opinion, he is.While the connections between most of the characters are friendships, along the way, some people may get confused, for the most part, it's simplistic romantic comedy with many relationships. I liked the fact that the main relationship was Gigi and Alex (not big name actors). Jennifer Aniston's relationship was heart-warming at the end.For the most part, people will call this a chick-flick, but I beg to differ. It's a guy movie too since it talks about how guys are when it comes to relationships. I, for one, agree that this is exactly how guys are. We're NOT complicated. We're simple. It's a reason why we can't figure out women. It's unfortunate that there can't be ""She's Just Not That Into You"" so guys could go to that and learn about women. If that was made, I assume ""Nora Ephron"" would write considering her movies are usually about women and men in relationships.Overall, I thought it was a good movie. A great many portions of the movie your gut will be splashing around from all the laughter you perform. You'll definitely say ""aww"" and ""oh my God."" I know I did. Girls, drag your guy to this one. Guys, don't resist the dragging. Both genders will enjoy this movie. Guaranteed.",He's Just Not That Into You
70,Hallelujah289,A sugary rom-com with some medicinal food for thought,7,10 May 2020,"""He's Just Not That Into You"" is based off of a self-help book by the same name. The advice basically is, don't overthink, don't obsess over the mediocre and vaguely interested, and be ready to move on if there aren't deliberate, clear and uncomplicated signs of interest. Basically, skip the drama, but also take care to note what could be an ""exception to the rule,"" as the movie emphasizes in its many kinds of relationships.All this amounts to what I think is a unique message that does hit home, even though it's a bit undone at times by the film itself, which tends to force relationships for plot that don't have the best logic or chemistry.There's a lot that hits home in this film, and a lot that just seems off, like the random roulette or relationships and also the actions of the married man, which was all of understandable, and twisted, and also oddly cavalier. Perhaps the movie overall suffers from too much saturated color and cheerful music, when it is rather about a lot of casual crappiness that everyone just thinks is normal. I guess that sort of dissonance works in a way, because the movie is about rejection that has been sugarcoated, and sugarcoated in such a way you know something is off but you can't quite pin it down. And that's mainly how I feel about much of the relationships that appear in this film.Of note is the gay characters in this film are pretty stereotyped in a cringe way as the dating advice squad. Really a missed mark there, although admittedly the characterizations for the other characters aren't great either.Otherwise, I think ""He's Just Not That Into You"" is a vehicle for a good message about self-respect that isn't often heard. The movie also manages to get across that even its own message shouldn't be taken too literally, and that not all challenges work with a one-size-fits-all solution (for example the difference between married and dating couples).

75,Gideon24,Rambling and Overlong,5,8 April 2015,"Despite an attractive cast, 2009's He's Just Not That Into You is a rambling and overlong comedy drama that tries to offer humorous insight into navigating the oh-so-choppy waters of dating in the New Millennium, but aggravates in its one-sided man-bashing and the overlong journeys that the multiple story lines take to their conclusions.The multiple stories are loosely tied together by the fact that three of the female leads (Jennifer Aniston, Jennifer Connelly, Ginnifer Goodwin) all work in the same office. Aniston plays a woman in a committed relationship of 7 years with a man (Ben Affleck) who likes their relationship as it is and has no desire to get married.Connolly plays a tightly wound woman, married to a music executive (Bradley Cooper) who is putting her marriage at serious risk because she won't tolerate her husband's smoking, which might have had something to do with his being drawn to a struggling singer (Scarlett Johansson), who is the obsession of a real estate agent (Kevin Connolly), though she does not return his feelings.Goodwin plays an emotionally needy woman, desperate to be in a relationship, who after being dumped by Connolly, meets his best friend (Justin Long), who begins to offer Goodwin insight into interpreting male dating signals while misinterpreting signals of his own.Despite a smooth directorial hand from Ken Kwapis, the film suffers from a rambling and disjointed screenplay that is kind of all over the place, leaving plot lines and characters hanging in the air and inserting characters that feel like they are left over from another movie. The Drew Barrymore character who addresses social media's effect on dating, definitely seems to be an escapee from another movie and Aniston's character is seen in a bunch of pointless scenes with her family after she breaks up with Affleck.Some satisfaction is gleaned from the Goodwin/Long story as it is addressed throughout the film and even though it is hard to buy young Long being such a complete expert on the male dating psyche, he manages to infuse his character, Alex, with a likability that is infectious. Ditto, Goodwin, who somehow makes her hot mess of a character, one of the few characters in the film we really root for.The cast is pretty, the story is well-intentioned, but the film suffers due to some simplistic character-bashing, some unappealing characters and a screenplay that could have used tightening, as the film is at least 30 minutes too long.",He's Just Not That Into You
76,ltlacey,The relationships between men and women.,7,2 June 2009,"I think what makes people not like this movie so much is that it is stuck in the genre, romantic comedy, and therefore people are expecting a romantic comedy. But this movie is not a rom-com. It is a romantic drama with some comedic elements. Once you realize this and know that it is not a comedy you can then sit back and enjoy the show. Yes, men can be jerks, but so can women. Yes, women can be whiny and clingy, but so can men. And regardless of one's age or where one lives, or even if you are straight or gay. That was the point, at least what I got out of it, of this movie. Yes, it was a movie full of clichés, but so is life. What I wanted was to see more of Drew Barrymore, but what little we did see of her was her usual wonderful self (okay, I am biased). I, too, was expecting a rom-com, and the movie starts out as one, but it did not take me long to realize that it was more a drama than anything else. So watch the movie with that in mind and see what you think with a different mindset. You might be surprised.",He's Just Not That Into You

78,headhunter46,"Enjoyable movie, mostly likable characters",6,12 February 2013,"Spoilers from me are mild, mostly just involving plot. I doubt it will ruin the movie for anyone as it reveals very little. There actually is some good advice in this movie for singles and married folks alike.Ladies, if he doesn't call you, it's because he's not all that interested. Who knows why? Maybe he doesn't like your laugh, or you remind him of on overbearing aunt who drove him nuts as a kid. Maybe you are too laid back or too outgoing. Don't dwell on it, find someone who likes YOU. That is something some women just don't want to believe. Watch this movie and maybe you will finally get the point. A woman who pursues a man is a turn off, maybe even scary.Guys, don't tell a woman you will call her if you don't intend to. That leaves her hanging in limbo.Guys don't lie, not even little white ones. If she discovers one of them to be a lie, it ruins your credibility and in the future if something big comes up, she has one less reason to believe you.Ladies, don't do a total turn around after you get married thinking your man won't notice. It's a turn off. It comes across as if you were pretending the whole time you dated and now he is with someone he would not have married if he had known. It's like a lie. You can't be lovey-dovey and fun while dating then become more like business partners after you marry and expect it to be a healthy, happy marriage.I think the movie did a reasonable job of covering what it's like to be dating. I haven't done so since 1969, but I have sons and grandchildren who offer feedback. Not much has changed since 1969, with the exception of all the electronics making it a bit too easy to stalk someone, HAH.This is not a movie I will need to watch again in the near future but that doesn't mean it is a bad movie. It is the kind of movie that is memorable for the manner in which it presents the characters. It rather leaves one with a feeling of completion, not hungering for more. Five years from now when all the actors have gone on to other projects, I may decide to give it another look to see how they have changed. Problem is, the video stores probably won't have it in the shelves any more. I'll have to see if it is available from netflix or some other source.",He's Just Not That Into You
79,plasticanimalz,Unwatchable,1,13 June 2009,"I had heard that it was cute and funny, so, I thought I would at least get an amusing, fluffy rom com. I would say it was more along the lines of excruciating. I read the book, and I think Greg Berhandt is a nice guy, so I'm glad he's not responsible for this miserable and weak interpretation. If you want to understand men and dating just watch Sex In The City. Great show. If you want to think all men are complete a**#$@*^s and fear dating forever, watch this movie.All it was was a minagerie of all of the worst traits of guys. The cheater. The guy that won't marry his girlfriend. The guy who ignores girls who like him and is obsessed with a girl who is way out of his league. A guy who is sort of nice, but also sort of a d*** and has shut out women for so long that he doesn't realize when he's met one he actually likes. Snore. They took the worst stereotypes of men and made them completely one-dimensional with no particular redeeming qualities other than they did actually like women.There is nothing worse than a romantic comedy written by men, 'cause there is absolutely no romance. They didn't portray reality so much as they did portray how guys would like the world to be. To make little effort and for the woman, to mostly accept that his answer is good enough. It was the polar oppossite of a flowery romance. Neither of which, are that realistic, but at least the flowery one fits the genre. I mean, aren't your characters supposed to be likable and redeeming in a romantic comedy? You don't have car crashes and explosions to fall back on.This was truly one of the worst movies I've seen, probably since Godzilla. Confusing. Pointless. I forgot Ben Affleck and Drew Barrymore were even in the movie half the time. Nobody accept maybe Ginnifer Goodwin was partly likable. And what in the world is likable or a romantic about a woman who thinks she's found her dream guy in a married man and pushes him into cheating? Tasteless.Just horrible.",He's Just Not That Into You

Finally.,10,15 December 2009,"there's a lot of things that are fantastic in this gem. the acting is brilliant, the story is awesome and this movie really spoke to me on many levels and i think it will to a lot of other people. the film handles in a lot of relationship problems that we have all had to endure sometime in our lives. there's a lot of characters in this and all of them have either a problem in there relationship or they are cheating on there other half or they just cant find the right person and in order to find the right person an action plan has to be filled out. all the stars we're excellent in this....... Ben Affleck, Jennifer Aniston, Jennifer Connelly, Scarlett Johansson, Justin Long, Drew Barrymore and Bradley Cooper really do awesome jobs as people in relationship dilemma's. now i really ain't into romance film but this film was really fantastic. so what i'm trying to say is if your are not into romantic films you really should give this a try because it has a lot going for it.i really cant pick my favourite characters because they are all brilliant. some of the situations these characters get into are really funny and original. the film holds a fair amount of twist's too which i find a little strange due to it being a romantic film but it makes the film a lot more interesting. overall this film should be watched by all because i wouldn't consider this to be a chick flick because it hits a lot of guy situations. this really is a brilliant film................. 9.7/10...........j.d Seaton",He's Just Not That Into You
81,donwc1996,Superb Ensemble,10,25 July 2013,This is truly an excellent flick. I enjoyed every minute of it. The cast is utter perfection. The story absolutely rings true and I did not detect a single sour note. The performances were uniformly first rate. The cast - both male and female - were just plain fun to look at they are so pretty - especially Jennifer Connelly and Bradley Cooper - yikes what sparks were flying - had my juices running full steam. This is a fun movie but it has something serious to say too - it's not all roses - after all life has its thorns and we have to live with them and surpass them the best we can. This film is very inspirational and upbeat because with all the fun it still manages to make you feel like life is okay and the human race isn't so bad after all. I guess it is what you would call a good feeling movie and that pretty much sums it up.,He's Just Not That Into You
82,cosmorados,The chick flick with a little bit more in the tank,8,14 March 2009,"The film starts with a little girl in a playground getting bullied by a boy, and her mother telling her that this means that the boy likes her, setting up the premise that the more a guy treats a woman like dirt, the more she'll hang around on the phone waiting for his call. From this point we follow the relationship woes of six (no eight, nine, is it ten?) different people and their relationships ups and downs, as one guy is trapped in a loveless marriage, one couple realise they want different things and one woman who is trying to figure out how to play the dating game, the stories cross and intertwine and from this comical situations ensue.Now, from the tone of the last part of that sentence you may well have come to the conclusion that this is just another standard romantic comedy chick-flick, and, on paper, it should be. But it's not. The script is very similar in tone and feel to ""When Harry met Sally"" with ""supposed"" regular people introducing each chapter of the film, the insights are decent and the dialogue contains a lot of honesty that I think many people can relate to. The cast are all first rate with special attention going to Ben Affleck, who has so needed a good role in front of the camera for ages, and Jennifer Aniston as the couple who can't move forward, also good are Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Connolly in their respective roles. The big star turns for me though are Ginnifer Goodwin and Justin Long as the hapless dater and the hapless dating coach, who are really good. For Long it's another step up the Hollywood ranks (pretty much the direction he's been heading since ""Dodgeball"") and for Goodwin it is a star-making turn that should do for her what ""knocked-up"" did for Heigl.The film of course has a number of elements and outcomes that are extremely predictable (it IS a romantic comedy) but there's enough other stuff in there, and definite surprises at the end, to make it more than just the sum of its parts. It's charming, clever and, when viewed with a pantomime-style audience that I saw it with, a lot of fun, and I'm a guy! A cross between ""When Harry met Sally"" and ""Friends"" that doesn't try and jump on the gross-out comedy bandwagon.Good stuff",He's Just Not That Into You
83,Jakemcclake,Inspirational Romantic Comedy Despite Stereotypes,10,24 August 2009,"I can understand after seeing this why so many top stars chose to be in this movie and one star put her money into it as a producer. I can understand after seeing the ending, why some of the movie audiences cheered at the ending. I fully expect this movie to be shown on TV or Cable on future Valentines days. Jennifer Connelly is one of the stars and she is more than an attractive woman appearing in movies, she is an Oscar award winning actress who is one of the very best actresses around. Part of the reason, I say this is because she usually appears in great movies, like, House of Sand and Fog, Blood Diamonds, etc. I have read the comments of the people who did not like this movie, and shockingly, I agree with almost all of them. There are many story lines in this movie and one can get lost among them, or lose interest in them. There are also many stereotypes in this movie. Some of the movie is unrealistic. This movie also has some of the standard predictable and perhaps a little unrealistic romantic comedy ending of couples making big about faces to get together, in spite of their prior hard to budge stands. Some couples also breakup in the movie. However, if one focuses on one of the characters, Gigi, there is a powerful optimistic/hope message intermingled in the multiple story lines, that was hard to ignore.The numerous big stars in this movie played secondary to the lesser known Genifer Goodwyn who portrays Gigi the main focus and the overall hope message of this movie. They also found inspirational music for this movie, and similar to Rocky, they choreographed the climactic scene to a fantastic song (Somewhere Only We Know). The complexity of this movie and subtext behind the plot in issues like one character's ""Smoking"" also made it worth watching.The final words of the movie, coupled with the great ending music made me feel inspired.",He's Just Not That Into You

86,piratecannon,Welcome to the Suck,3,27 December 2012,"For Valentine's Day, I decided that, being the loving husband that I am, I'd take Erica to a movie she wanted to see for once. Going in, I tried to have an open mind. I genuinely enjoyed Love Actually, and the reviews I'd read of HJNTIY suggested it had some striking similarities. I think I can make this a little more succinct than my typical reviews, so I'll sum it up in 17 words and then provide some very brief thoughts.HJNTIY is awkward, sadistic, and ultimately a garbled mess that has no real payoff at its conclusion.Almost every one of the 6 or so leading characters is borderline psychotic. The movie thinks it's clever because it identifies some women's need to sit impatiently by a phone, hoping that a guy she shared a drink with two nights earlier will call, but it comes off as being forced and obnoxious. As a matter of fact, I was hoping that the aforementioned character (whose name slips me, but trust me, it doesn't really matter) would have her obsessive/compulsive hopes for true romance dashed sometime during the final act. Of course, as is the case with most romcoms, the exact opposite happens. This in and of itself isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it seems like she learns absolutely nothing through the process–she simply takes other people's advice without thinking, and her soon-to-be-boyfriend falls into her lap in a rather unconvincing way–she has a meltdown at his apartment after she realizes that he's not initially interested in her, and, by some unexplained miracle, this tantrum makes him realize what an idiot he's been. Puh-lease.In addition, various scenes of the film are ""spliced"" with strangely out of place sequences of random people looking directly into the camera and discussing their own relationship experiences.Of course, there are one or two funny scenes, but these are few and far between. What seemed to be the ultimate demise of the film is that it tiptoed a fine line somewhere between existing as a comedy and a drama. In the end, it descends into an almost soap-opera-like existence, with one tragedy or triumph constantly (and fairly unrealistically) topping its immediate predecessor.After the movie ended, Erica wasn't really all that impressed either (which is, in all honestly, the true death knell of a movie such as HJNTIY). When the intended audience finds it all repetitive and ho-hum, it's fairly clear that the end is nigh.Ironically, HJNTIY becomes the very thing its conclusion pretends to rail against–""the rule,"" to use its own relationship lingo. In the world of romcoms, it's a movie that's certainly not the exception.",He's Just Not That Into You

I mean lets face it Harry Met Sally and Sleepless in Seattle set the bar so high that anything else will pale in comparison.But to me this movie kind of shows now modern relationships work or don't work. If anything is a falter in this story it is that it trys to hard to show too many stories. Sure there is X likes Y but Y likes Z but Z is married to A. Which is always entertaining.Then there is the Ben Affleck / Jeniffer Aniston couple that may sum up most of the ""couples"" I know.The whole mentioning of ""new dating rules"" is kind of cool to see that cell phones, emails, myspace and speeddating have replaced and re-written the rules for dating...and in some way made it harder not easier. Some people says this movie is full of stereotypes. In my opinion it covers just about all the realities in dating...especially dating in fast paced big city life.What I liked though is the movie balanced ""The Bad Guy"" with ""Bad Girl"" Showing that there are breakups faulted by both sides.

88,butchfilms,Watchable,6,21 February 2009,"I think the biggest problem with this movie is that it try to be a drama and a comedy at the same time and at the end it doesn't achieve what was expected. I think if this would have been a 100 % drama (parts of Scarlett Johansson, Jennifer Aniston and Jennifer Connelly)or 100 % comedy (parts of Drew Barrymore and Ginnifer Goodwin) the result would have being much better, it's like two very different movies would have being mixed. I am not saying that this is a bad movie but it's just watchable. This could haven been a very good movie if it only would have focused in the drama part which had a great potential to be exploited. Another problem is that the movie last too long (129 minutes) I think that 100 would have been OK. I liked a lot the performance of Jennifer Connelly, in a more serious film she could have got nominations for her role.The movie is about 5 women who are looking to be happy in their sentimental life, 2 of them live with their couples and are looking to reinforce their relationships and the other 3 are single and are looking the love of their life in different ways ......If you are a man I would recommend you to watch it only with your girlfriend or in a date otherwise don't (wait there are 4 beautiful reasons to watch it: Scarlett Johansson, Jennifer Aniston, Drew Barrymore and Jennifer Connelly) .

90,tml_pohlak_13,I'm Just Not That Into This Movie,5,7 June 2009,"To begin, the film is so convoluted. It has so many characters to keep track of (each with their own affairs and business relationships to boot), and they are in some way connected, that I just couldn't care less. The people I saw the movie with agreed. Jennifer Aniston plays her standard, ""frustrated female"" role. Justin Long and Ginnifer Goodwin play cardboard caricatures, not characters, yet they do an excellent job with their material, and as far as acting is concerned, they are the highlights of the film.I wasn't expecting much when I saw it, but the film fell even lower than my sub-par expectations. Of course, as a romantic comedy, I can't be too harsh. It follows the classic (now cliché) romantic-comedy formula. As a comedy, the film scores every so often. (The most brilliantly comic sequence is when Gigi, played by Goodwin, phones Alex (Long) for advice from the bathroom of a guy she's considering sleeping with. The actors' performances steal the show. Another fun sequence involves Gigi believing she is co-hosting Alex's party. The vignettes of random people giving romantic advice are for the most part hilarious. And, cliché as it is, gay office workers excitedly keeping track of a female worker's love life is comic gold—perfectly executed by the actors.) However, by the end, it feels little more than a series of humorous vignettes loosely tied together with too much stale material.The Verdict: ""He's Just Not That Into You"" involves several funny scenes tied together poorly to form an (overall) unattractive, convoluted package.Overall Rating: 5/10",He's Just Not That Into You

Where we depart honesty, treading onto the disreputable ground of veleitarianism, is the point when the shallow characters, the shaky story and the doubtful humor start to fancy themselves (much) more than they (unfortunately) are. In his case, the ill parts from the script. Unable to create anything original in the ingrate realm of the SexAndTheCity-ism, the authors forced themselves to become original no matter what, putting together the lousy story as if it was a springy and user-friendly tome of the inept genre ""How to (bla-bla) in Ten Short Steps"". Well, since the story wasn't really there, this brave attempt only put the cherry on the cake of a disjointed, hard to follow and ultimately BORING movie. What it did have (and yes, it did have!) got were about two dozens of funny puns, painfully extracting as many ""Hah!""s from those spectators that weren't sleeping already.But, as my colleague Dana Duma said, we should give to the Caesar what belongs to the Caesar: ""A movie that lets you sleep in peace can't be 100% bad!""",He's Just Not That Into You

At least until the trashy Hollywood ending, i was well entertained. The problem there is that i was more with the guys in this movie, which supposedly are the ""evil ones"". But seriously, the women acted mostly in such naive ways, they just had coming whatever these guys tricked them into. I guess i have to rethink my attitude towards women...? Whatever.I especially enjoyed Bradley Coopers performance as the husband, which got the saddle on too early and doesn't find his way out between a boring marriage and an affair. As i also loved ""Hangover"", i guess i have to watch out for movies with him. He's got a great comedic talent. The rest of the cast is okay. The female cast i'm not so sure about. As the roles were mostly about naive girls, i don't have the feeling there was a lot of talent asked. The ""Friends""-girls simply played their friends role with a little bit more realism. Justin Long reminded me to a young Keanu Reeves. I'm sure he hears that a lot and can't say if that is a compliment. As the rest of the cast he was on par, not more, not less.So whom can i recommend this movie to? Well, i certainly will watch that with some buddies over a beer or two and spare the end by pretending they all ditch their girls. And girls? Well, the whole thing is pretty predictable, so if you aren't as naive as these girls, you might be either bored by it or in case you can think like a guy, you might as well be able to have a laugh at them.

As well as that it shows what you should do and what you should not do when finding out if someone likes you or not. Along with other big stars this has a lot of laughs and instances where you see that you could relate to.

I have never met a garbage bag as bad as the guys portrayed in this film; and 2. none of my friends are neurotic, crazy, desperate women like the women portrayed in this film. Seriously. Ginnifer Goodwin's character alone is enough to make you want to watch this with your eyes rolled up inside your head to spare you from rolling them up every 5 seconds of her screen time. Kudos to her as an actress, for making such a pathetic character truly come across as the pathetic character I imagine she is meant to be. On the subject of actresses, and therefore actors - the cast is amazing in that there are a lot of well-known names in the credits. What a crying shame that they could not have lent those names to something way better than what is this trite, awful film turned out to be.Skip like the plague, and if you have daughters, PLEASE teach them that this film does not depict what real girls and women are like.",He's Just Not That Into You

Honestly, it was life in my 20's crammed into a 2 hour movie. Some scenes in this movie had a haunting familiarity to them.The bottom line is, if a guy is interested he will call.Good looking A list cast includes Bradley Cooper (in the movie is married to Jennifer Connolly) and they have a troubled marriage. Ben Affleck is dating Jennifer Aniston's character. Scarlett Johansson (who is AWFUL in this film) is dating Kevin Connolly but having a fling with someone else too. Justin Long (Alex) and Drew Barrymore (Mary)are in it but do not date in the movie, but do in real life. Gennifer Goodwin is the single woman desperately wanting to hook up and scaring guys off in the process.Movie was a bit clichéd and I am a little tired of seeing Jennifer Aniston in the same type of role, which is probably why I do not watch many of her films. She is pretty much typecast as the single woman with boyfriend problems. Script is OK and had a few funny moments but not a masterpiece by any means. People who have played the field, done the bar scene will get some laughs. Anyone who was never spent much time single is probably glad they weren't after watching this movie.6/10",He's Just Not That Into You

It concerns 9 characters who are into each other to varying degrees. The 9 lives intersect with each other in clever ways. Most characters are self-destructive to varying degrees. The title character is Gi Gi (Ginnifer Goodwin) fails time and time again romantically mostly because she tries too hard and cannot read a single sign. It also has sub plots of a couple who have been together for a long time but do not marry (Jennifer Anniston and Ben Afflick) and a love triangle (Jennifer Connely, Scarlett Johannssen and Bradley Cooper). In addition, it had some great cameos and lesser parts including Kevin Connelly and Drew Barrymoore (who's production company helped make the film). It got some terrible reviews but eventually did okay commercially grossing $180 million at the box office. The acting, lines and interactions are all well done and make for a great film.

103,larrysmile1,Many actors got jobs - but the story was lacking.,5,28 December 2009,"While I understand that Drew Barrymore's Production Company, Flower Films, gave many jobs to actors in this film with a choppy story-line, the film lacked the really ""deep"" impact about an in-depth relationship between two people. When it comes to a love story, I prefer a story having only two principals - the male and the female - such as Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in ""Casablanca."" In ""...not that into you"" we have Sniglets of scenes with such major stars as Jennifer Aniston, Drew Barrymore, Scarlett Johansson, Jennifer Connolly, and Ginnifer Goodwin - with similar impact for the male stars. While I do enjoy seeing these stars on film, I believe that, aside from giving actors income at union scale or otherwise, these major female actors deserve to be in a film story that they are the exclusive female star acting opposite a single male co-star as their love interest. The written dialog contained too many ""one-liners"" being bantered back and forth. Such dialog does not challenge an actor's talents and does not rise to the level that talented actors deserve in the dialog that they speak in the story. It is not enough to make the audience ""infer"" emotion between two actors in a scene just by a ""look or a glance."" A good story must be told in words spoken as the film progresses. If the words don't entice a person's mind to mentally engage in the story the writer and director run the risk of boring the audience and putting them to sleep.Likewise, when scenes are so choppy that a scene is not developed longer than 30 seconds to a minute in length we have the effect of ""looking at snapshots in someone's photo album! An expensively made motion picture is not a music video where every 3 seconds or so the scene has to change. Good scenes should be before the audience's eyes and ears long enough to impart meaning in the viewer's brain.The story-line would have been more engaging if the five females were actually sisters from the same family - with more involvement with their father, Kris Kristofferson - in the story-line as a father who is trying to guide his five daughters into deciding on whether their boyfriends are indeed good candidates for marriage with his daughters. Kris Kristofferson deserved a better part, more involved and expanded as the story progressed. There are so many things wrong with the story-line that a complete rewrite is needed.I thoroughly enjoy the acting of Drew Barrymore and Scarlett Johansson, for example, when they are the primary stars of a film. It seems that this story-line is just an expanded version of an episode of ""Friends."" And, if that is what the intent was by the writers, director, and production company, so be it.""He's Just Not That Into You"" lacks the staying power of ""Never Been Kissed"" or ""Ever After - A Cinderella Story.""

104,pmitsi-1,Good messages but some irritating characters,7,1 September 2009,"I will not say this is a great film, but it was good in the fact that it stated so many bitter truths about dating and people in general.The Gigi character was plainly put irritating, but I guess it was the writer's way of showing us how many misconceptions are there that people can easily hang on forever.... I would prefer her story without the cliché ""the clueless character finally gets the wiser"" happy ending, because it is in fact erasing the ""lessons"" taught earlier in the movie (told by Alex and from her sister).Let's face it, her behavior after her date with Connor, to the bar embarrassing herself in frond of Alex, to the waiter that made the tragic mistake to pay her some attention and finally at Alex's party, is just pathetic. It makes her sudden ""wisdom"" towards the end of the film very unconvincing... And changes like this don't happen in a moment. Only at cinema you go from a sheep to a lion instantly...Another irritating character was her brother-in-law (didnt bother to notice his name), who doesn't make a rational action thru the entire film. He admits cheating, but not that he smoked for crissakes! With his idiotic inability to make decisions, he manages to humiliate both the women that want him in a degree that both leave him in the end...Lastly, I would like to express the wish I had seen this film earlier. As Alex and others indicate in the movie, the signs are always there and the excuses that men (and people in general) can make to let us hope with no reason are endless. We must always go, when we sense things are not right even if the other part won't admit it. We are letting them use us if not...",He's Just Not That Into You

Not only did it teach a lesson, but it gives women a sense of freedom and independence.The all-star cast features Jennifer Aniston, Ben Affleck, Jennifer Connelly, Scarlett Johansson and Drew Barrymore. But my favorites were two actors whom I hadn't seen before. Ginnifer Goodwin plays Gigi, a hopeless romantic looking for love in all the wrong places. She is perfect in this role. She is so pretty and cute and I love her hair. I felt that I could relate to Gigi, especially when she said ""there won't be anyone left."" At the end, of course, she finds her true love in Alex (Justin Long), my other favorite. A cynical bartender who is used to using women for his amusement, he confesses to her that he ""didn't know what it felt like when I fell for one of them."" Long is adorable even when he is being a jerk. During their kiss scene at the end, I found myself grinning from ear to ear. Perfect chemistry.The others in this movie also turn out fine performances. Barrymore's part was smaller than the others, she did not have as much screen time. I was glad to see that not everyone got a happy ending; this is indicative of real life. Not everyone does get the love of their life. Why should they in the story? The costumes are fabulous, stylish and modern. The setting is Baltimore, Maryland. This made me happy as I get tired of seeing New York in every movie. A nice change of pace.If anyone is looking for a movie with girl-power, see He's Just Not that Into You.

GINNIFER GOODWIN plays a needy woman who naively believes the lines she's fed, and JUSTIN LONG tries to clue her in reality-wise. JENNIFER ANISTON & BEN AFFLECK play a long-term couple with problems. SCARLETT JOHANSSON flits in & out of the lives of numerous people including KEVIN CONNOLLY & BRADLEY COOPER. DREW BARRYMORE, JENNIFER CONNELLY, KRIS KRISTOFFERSON and others effectively add to the mix. As a friend commented, he'd expected this to be a chick flick, & instead it was an unexpectedly thought-provoking and telling commentary on life today, with characters who strongly reminded him of numerous people he HIMSELF knows.

111,sugar_daddyo,"An American Edition of ""Love Actually""",4,21 June 2009,"I guess it was just a matter of time before they served up an American version of the Brit romantic comedy ""Love Actually."" And like its English cousin it tries to explore many different kinds of love between an odd assortment of characters whose lives just as oddly intertwine. It's pointless to list the characters but here goes: you got a married couple with the husband contemplating adultery, an unmarried couple with the women contemplating marriage, some gay men who contemplate sex in three seconds or less, and a few lost puppies thrown in for good humor.My main complaint is this movie comes down hard on the notion of traditional marriage. It puts forth the silly idea that men hate commitment while women constantly agonize over finding Mr. Right and are even devious in their methods to trap men in marriages from which they only want out.But the inaccuracies don't stop there. This movie tries to be hip by name dropping MySpace but dwells stupidly long on the ""waiting for the call"" and answering machines of all the anachronistic things. MySpace is so 2005. This is 2009 where Facebook and texting are de rigeur while a phone call is regarded as stalking at best, perverted at worst.I am not even sure why this is regarded as a romantic comedy. It is not the least bit funny unless you find the stupid vignettes so.Ah well, I never expect to come away from a ""romantic comedy"" feeling satisfied.

Doesn't make things any better, if not worse.Stupid generalisations and stereotyping plague this movie. Men are being portrayed as pretentious dumbasses, women being portrayed as desperate for a relationship, gay being portrayed so stereotypically it's not even funny.

Guy proposes to girl. Could this have been any more predictable? Yes all the stories (4 in total) are this retarded. The movie's too long for it's own good.

Why is Ginnifer Goodwin so clueless and beholden to these awful men? Scarlett is the only empowered one, but she's just out to advance her own career. Drew Barrymore is clueless. Jennifer Aniston should have given that ultimatum a long time ago. The film makes men look like a-holes, but it make women look even worse. Fun, but not very true to life.

116,TomCruiseFan99,I'm SO INTO this movie!,10,12 February 2009,"This sumptuous ensemble romantic comedy managed to exceed my expectations in every way. It was extremely hilarious and utterly realistic, and features an eclectic cast that all add something different to this intriguing tale of dealing with the pitfalls of dating and marriage.The story begins with Gigi. After a first date, she becomes mildly obsessive waiting for the guy to call her during the week after. But he doesn't and this is the catalyst that eventually proceeds to link all the characters together in interconnected plot lines that range from funny and sweet, (Drew Barrymore's character bemoaning the fact that there's so much technology out there and she's managed to get dumped via email, MySpace and SMS) to tragic and heartbreaking (Ben Afflleck and Jennifer Aniston's characters not seeing eye to eye on getting married and so she would rather throw away their 7 year old relationship).Scarlet Johansson also plays a pivotal role, that of a single woman who has a friend pining for her, but she would rather try and tempt a married man who himself is going through a rough patch with his wife, played to perfection by Jennifer Connelly. The way that this love-quadrangle plays out forms the basis for the realism factor, and while there are some sweet and tender moments, it's ultimately a tragedy that you can see is coming, because for this foursome, 2 people are gonna get hurt. And this plot line is expertly written.Justin Long provides the voice of reason fashioned on the book on which the movie is based. His character, Alex, is the advice-dispensing guide who takes Gigi under his wing and tries to reveal all the ins and outs of dating dos and don'ts. And this masterstroke is how the movie becomes a guide just like the book, while also telling a story that many of us will see ourselves in.The acting is all pretty faultless, with Jennifer Aniston, Jennifer Connelly, Brendan Cooper and Justing Long displaying some of their best work. Scarlet is as stunning as ever, and plays the temptress well, but Barrymore is sadly underutilized. In total, I think she might only have 10 minutes worth of screen time, but she does use it well.And I wouldn't go so far to call this a 'chick flick', as I think there's just as much enjoyment and knowledge to be gained from this movie for us guys as there is for women.

In short, the basic variety any woman runs into on Match.com. Then there were a couple of stand-up guy characters. Were parts of the plot formulaic? Sure. It's a movie. There were a few surprises, however.All of the female characters were likable, which is a switch from standard Hollywood sexism. The acting was above average and I was pleasantly surprised by Scarlett Johannson's performance. I only didn't like Ginnifer Goodwin's slapstick-style performance as a desperate dater.

All people in this film are occupied by the thought from morning to night every day. I was wondering if there is any other interests for them: job? school? hobbies? money? faith? dedications to others? dream other than opposite sex? Yes! They must have one(s). But due to the poor description of each personality in the script, all of them look rather foolish and shallow. Everybody may not live alone, so the theme in this film must be important. Only if the script had given other deep and various factors to each personality, this comedy would have been really funny and interesting. Though the cast is gorgeous, it is a pity that those actors cannot fully present their charms and acting skills.A friend of mine on the thirties (single) told me that he loved this film because the tactics and bargaining between men and women really hit close to him. Young people on the ground might find this film interesting and useful. Older generation like me tend to think love affairs should be more direct and frank, spoiled by the old movies where men and women get into romance so easily.

Ginnifer Goodwin did a fantastic job as the smart, witty, light-hearted city girl just looking for love in all the wrong places.

If only guys really knew what we girls do. In the end though, she found her happily every after. And I must say her love interest Alex, played by Justin Long, did an amazing job as well.

But the worst part was Jennifer Connelly. Her acting and role were horrible considering that she is an Oscar winner. Scarlett Johanson's charm to a married man was believable since I have heard many real life stories in which single lady was having affair with a married man. Even in country like India, these single ladies are mostly fitness experts, lifestyle advisers just like Scarlett as Yoga instructor.The best part was Jennifer Aniston's desperation to get married to long time partner.

123,jkysharma,The cult of the Answering Machine,6,6 June 2009,"""If a guy is really interested, he will call ... make it happen"" maintains Alex (Justin Long) pretty much throughout the movie. This is established upfront in the movie and is reiterated quite often. Another flick of the dating-culture ilk, 'He's Just Not That Into You' has a different origin in that it is sourced from a self-help book of the same name by Greg Behrendt (discourse) and Liz Tuccillo (conclusions). This lends it a distinct case-study feel inspite of the inter-connections among the chapter-based story threads. Novelties pop up here and there (director Ken Kwapis) but by and large this film suffers from lack of constancy of purpose. I don't know if they intended it to be a light-hearted romp because there are moments that suggest more depth.Considering that Liz Tuccillo and Drew Barrymore (producer) are part of the setup, one would've to think that they want the women in the film to buy the movie's sell on some level but have difficulty in digesting it when confronted with it. It still doesn't explain why the women act as if their only agenda is being involved with a guy. The arc involving Beth (Jennifer Anniston) and Neil (Ben Affleck in a muted turn) is the only one with a semblance of normalcy to it and even here, the resolution panders to the target audience rather than run its natural course. The actor most likely to gain from this is Ginnifer Goodwin as Gigi. Her desperate attempts at making a date run the distance are comical to begin with, grate after a while and then is given surprisingly serious treatment towards the end.'He's Just Not That Into You' happens to be the first 'chick flick' I've watched on big screen.

Single women egg each other on to have affairs with married men.5. Married men meet hot single women and promptly have affairs with them.6. Single women have large support groups of gay men.7. Men in relationships never want to get married.8. Women in relationships can only get married if they threaten to leave the relationship unless it leads to marriage.9. Single women are eager to throw themselves at single men who haven't given even a sign of interest.10. Everyone out there has a soul mate on hand.Jennifer Aniston may be acceptable as an actress, but one of the easiest ways to kill as movie, is to cast her in it.

The Gigi character played by Ginnifer Goodwin would get any man to run in the opposite direction.This movie seems to focus on the female character's need to either be married or pregnant and facing the tick-tock clock of life. I thought the characters in the movie were just sad. The cheating husband, the slutty girl that tempts him to cheat even though she knows he's married, the wife who's wanting to get pregnant before her bio-clock ticks zero, the stalker who no one wants a second date with, etc - geez! It's no wonder why men bounce around from one girl to the next - watch this movie and find out the answers. It's a hard look at why men lose interest - I think this is one of the two reasons to endure this flick.

Where else can you find Drew Barrymore, Ben Affleck, Scarlett Johansson and more big names together like this? It's really awesome if you ask me. There are plot lines that are super silly and some that feel very real.For instance, Jennifer Anniston & Ben Affleck felt like a genuine relationship with a realistic dilemma. One wants marriage the other doesn't. I love their story in this movie. It was really touching.The moments that felt disingenuous were all the moments with Ginnifer Goodwin. First, I think Ginnifer is an amazing actress! But her character, Gigi, is a hot mess! Overly dramatic & desperate! I literally cringe at most of her scenes. She's acting like a 13-year old psychopath when it comes to men. I don't know many women that act as passionately as she does about EVERY guy they talk to, it was exhausting just to watch! So over-the-top. Although, I did like the way her and Justin Long's character got together. I adore Justin Long!So bottom line, most could sit through this movie mainly because of the cast. They are all excellent good actors. The only actor that seemed a bit out of place was Jennifer Connelly, and perhaps that was done on purpose.I'd say if you have a couple hours to spare and you like romantic comedies this is a decent choice.

This is one of the best romantic comedy movies of the year that also holds a certain drama to it. I like how it doesn't have your usual chick flick clichés and yet it doesn't fail to make you go 'Aww!' What a great cast complimenting a really relevant story. You will be interested in every character, every situation, and every thought provoking reasoning and its fun ways to deliver them.It is awesome how this movie takes everyday romantic situation that's not far fetched and injected them with effective comedy that's really funny and engaging. One way or another you've found yourself in similar situations before. You can't help but agreeing with all the truth that it's offering. And even if you don't agree with the game, the rule, and the exception, you can definitely find enjoyment in seeing the characters executing every self-help romantic lessons and street assumptions on the big screen. The only chick flick cliché left in here is the fact it still has those best friends who think they know all that and always give advices they don't take.Rarely will a book-based movie make you curious about reading after watching the big screen version, but after watching HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU, I might just find myself getting into the book that it's based on, by authors Greg Behrendt and Liz Tuccillo. There will be times when you'll feel the movie's runtime is a bit too long but that's usually what happens when you deal with an all stellar cast with interconnected plot ala Crash. But I think screenwriter Abby Kohn & Marc Silverstein and Ken Kwapis make sure you'll always be curious to see what happens next. Once again if the story doesn't get you, the humor will. For some reason we won't get tired of the stereotyped portrayal that Gay people seem to know better about relationship than straight people.When I saw this trailer months ago, I had my doubts,.. but I have them no more because every actor involved in this movie give excellent supporting performances. Not one outshines the others. These are current stars that can draw young adult audiences and they live up to the expectations. I'm glad Jennifer Connelly is there to provide the Oscar worthy drama, and Scarlett Johansson as the seductive temptress, even Ben Affleck is not too shabby in this one. Everybody has an essential part.

133,supernick-3,"If he's not into you, he's right",4,16 June 2009,"I was looking forward to seeing this movie. My girlfriend saw it with her friends and said it was good, and a nice relationship comedy with that many established stars and starlets really got my hopes up. It's not because I'm a man that I cannot enjoy this type of movie. So one evening I sunk down in my couch with a snack and a drink, and I gave it a go.It took two nights to sit through the whole thing.The movie started out the way I hoped it would: good interaction (even chemistry), good introduction of the characters, flawless acting, and the very good documentary parts where John and Jane Doe express their opinions.So what happened? Where to start? First off is the deeply psychotic aspect of the leading lady, strengthened by her emotionally challenged friends. As a man, I would stay clear away from them. Secondly, the men were depicted as stereotype dumb-asses, unable of change, stuck into straight-line thinking, thus feeding the mood swing attitude of the women. The men are the passive people in the story, who just let things happen, and allow to be changed. Do you expect me to believe that every woman craves a phone call, that he's just not that into them? Here's a stereotype for you: a straight man is into anything that has tits and breathes. I know thousands of men who make the described phone calls, only to be turned down. Women are far more cruel and picky than portrayed here. Sad.It's not that I don't believe these individual stories. They do happen. I can identify with the character of Alex, which pretty much sums it up for me. I've seen examples of all the other stories too. But here's the thing: there are far more interesting aspects of relationships and break-ups. When you have actors who can take it, why don't you explore those? People who start relationships with former partners of friends, long-distance issues, family issues, children, ...Finally, everybody is linked in Baltimore. Must be a true inbred community over there. If they ever have a big get-together, sh*t would really hit the fan. Maybe that's an idea for a sequel: all the same people in a 15 minute short-story about how they decide to completely abandon their lifelong friends. Because that at least is credible.Very disappointing. 4 out of 10, mostly thanks to the actors, especially Johansson and Cooper.",He's Just Not That Into You
134,editor-131,It's a mad mad mad mad mad mad dating world,6,11 February 2009,"I realized, watching this film, the formula of its title isn't quite right, requires some refinement. With so many new avenues for meeting potential romantic partnersand so many ways of juggling multiple prospects, for cheating, evading, dissing, blowing people off, putting them off, holding them off, keeping them in suspense, yet keeping them availablethinking they're in the running, or are The Oneit's clearly more complicated than ""Does he like me or not? Is he going to call or not? Is she into me or not?."" So, the real formula isn't ""He's just not that into you""it's ""He's just not that into just you.""! I should know. I've got a book in the works on my life dating, preying, dumping, loving and losing using the personals; in fact I tried to interest Greg Behrendt's literary agency in it, it being in somewhat the same vein as his original book the film is loosely derived from. That said, and as much as I've seen a fleeting write-off of the film as superficial, it's not that bad. Ginnifer Goodwin, the ingenuous third wife in HBO's polygamist ""Big Love,"" brings a similar energetic optimism to ""Not Into You,"" though it veers over into obsessive, self-deluded microscrutiny of every ""signal"" sent by potential partners, suitors, dates. A lot of the film is somewhat lightweight genre stuff, but it also offers characters who are in genuine non-farcical pain, such as Jennifers Connolly and Aniston. The film is admittedly full of false notes, with the monologue by Drew Barrymore about the number of tech channels through which you can hook up or be blown off being exactly as ""exhausting"" to hear in the film as it was when incessantly repeated in commercials and trailers. Justin Long as Alex is only believable in his jaded, insensitive, cynical-realist mode, as the vehicle for the disappointing clarity of insight Behrendt's book purports to offer, and not in his transformation into the romantic lead. He wasn't too likable in either mode, as much as I identified with him in the first one. (And Marci identified with Goodwin's Gigi; and Long and Goodwin made improbable partners, just asat least in others' eyes, M and I do.) The set of dalliances in which Scarlett Johansson is the link displays some reprehensible activities, but worst of all ... what was up with Kevin Connolly's hair? In one scene in particular, it looked like he had just been dipped upside-down in Grecian Formula and blow-dried on high. I kept expecting him to realize he was gay. You know, I guess this film was pretty bad, after all; it's certainly not more than the sum of its often flimsy parts. Especially in that, at the end, it upholds the contra-premise: that it's better in the end to be able to yearn, ga-ga- (Gigi-)like, eternally, hopefully, desperately wishing there is something there that may not beand probably isn't.",He's Just Not That Into You

136,dcfemella,I Was Just Not Into This Movie,4,2 July 2009,"""He's Not That Into You"" had some good advice for women, but it should have taken some advice on how to make a decent chick flick. The acting was lackluster; the script was meh, and I barely even faked a laugh. I was pretty disappointed because of the potential that this movie had. They should have just left it as a one-liner in the ""Sex and the City"" episode that it came from. It was funnier and interesting to hear Berger tell Miranda this, and her sharing the wealth with some reluctant women.Even though I kind of forwarded through the movie, I did have to say that the advice is sound. I even see myself doing this with my daughter. ""Oh honey, that boy is bothering you cause he likes you."" It did make me start thinking about what I say to my daughter and friends when it comes to ""guy advice."" However, I probably would have gotten more from just reading the book of the same name from Greg Behrendt and Liz Tuccillo, instead of being tortured to watch the entire film.The character that annoyed me the most was Gigi. She had this desperate personality when it came to men and then wondered why they ran away. It was worst because the one guy who would probably run faster when dealing with her is the one who was the love interest. If they wanted to keep it real and make it as a self-help guide for women to understand men, it should have been more realistic.I hate when movies have potential to be great, but then end up like this one.

There are some notable mentions I think, Drew Barrymore's brief cameo had some funny bits in it, and I also enjoyed Jennifer Connolly's performance, although due to the amount of characters, these two did not get enough screen time.Another issue I had with the movie seemed to be the star power that was put into it. There were too many names, too many characters and in the end it spoiled the movie, trying to be like CRASH or one of those interconnected movies, this fails on all counts.Some of the actors in this movie who I love such as Bradley Cooper (of ALIAS fame) was horrible, that being said his material left a lot to be desired.AND FINALLY THE WORST PART OF THE LOT!!! the ending.

I was really looking forward to seeing this movie since it was based on the popular book: He's Just Not That into you!!!! Basically my take on the book is that every woman is made for one man who loves her passionately, unconditionally with every fiber of his being. Now that book has been translated into a movie starring actors and actresses such as Drew Barrymore who also produced the movie, Ben Affleck, Scarlett Johannson, Jennifer Connelly and Jennifer Anniston. With a a list of actor and actresses one would think that the movie was a true reflection of the book. However this trend of thought is erroneous. Firstly what is the point of having homosexuals giving advice regarding what love between a man and woman should be like? Secondly why is it with Hollywood that nearly every movie must have homosexuals or homosexuality in it? What purpose does this serve? What meaningful insights can they give on a hetrosexual marriage? Also the film unfortunately portrays adultery in a very tame light. It gives the impression that adultery is okay if you have fallen out of love with your spouse. Also the couple played by Ben Affleck and Jennifer Anniston have lived together for seven (7) years and he's really not that into marriage. At the end of the movie he seems to have a revelation that marriage is a covenant for life. Also Jennifer Connelly plays the wife of a man who has had an affair. But hey this is okay and they should just live separate lives and ignore the covenant they made with each other for life. No trying to work things out here - take the easy road. This is a joke. What happened to the love and obsession that a man has for one woman and that he would die for her? Sadly that wasn't portrayed in this movie. Basically everyone sleeps and dates with others until they have found the right one. Hollywood doesn't understand what true love is. Go and watch a real movie like The Family Man!!!!!

Life and relationships are complex. Everyone is different, one woman/ man is different from every other and so no relationship can have a set rule or follow a pattern exactly. Perhaps lots follow a pattern for one reason or another, but they are all unique really. Many women (for example) are brought up believing their life and the relationship they find will go a certain way (house, marriage, kids etc), so they may try to influence that outcome if they find themselves in a promising relationship, because they think it's what they want or it is what they want, but unfortunately life is challenging, relationships must always be evolving and not all relationships are bound close enough to last. It may come down to asking, how well do you know your partner and what your partner wants now. The point of the movie, I think, is that relationships should be allowed to happen organically, from true interest and natural attraction, and, as they grow, emotional honesty is the best policy.

Many people do not like the movie, but i like the story line and as i described before, the cast.In the movie the women of modern era is described in very different way some people do not like it as it shows only the weakness of women, and women are shown very dependable on men.In the movie Neil and Beth has a problem, Beth wants to take their relationship to another level and get married but Neil does not believe in marriage. Then their is Ben who is not happy about his marriage life and finds it difficult to be his wife(Janine).And most importantly there is this character Gigi who tries to find someone for herself but fails but she keeps struggle until she finds Alex. For me the movie is very good and well time spending. I give the movie 7 stars. I hope people going to like this movie and enjoy it. Its sad for Bradley Cooper that he left alone in the END.......",He's Just Not That Into You

155,sprintz1132,Meh...,5,18 April 2009,"He's Just Not That Into You is an intriguing example of how a not-so-great movie could wind up being #1 at the box office. The trailer makes it look like a decent chick flick focusing mostly on its likable cast of familiar faces. Before the movie was released, actually, a hilarious video emerged on YouTube with three of the movie's leading men, Bradley Cooper, Kevin Connolly, and Justin Long acting out a list of 10 girlie movie clichés that won't be in the movie. I have to hand it to the promotion team behind this film. Those advertisers were geniuses. They managed to get people interested so that way even if critics slammed the movie, at least they make some money in the process.The funny thing is, this movie needed those chick flick clichés. Desperately. Without the clichés, the whole thing comes off rather depressing. Movies are meant to be a way to take one's mind off the stresses of daily life. What He's Just Not That Into You does is try heroically to be a movie of substance when it just, well, isn't. It plunges the viewer into over two hours of people just standing around and talking about all the problems in their life. Sure, relationships have their pitfalls, but while focusing on the bad aspects of them all along, it makes the inevitable happy ending feel like dry swallowing a pill. If the filmmakers hadn't spent the first three-quarters of the movie trying to impress the idea of the ""anti-chick flick"" then the final act where everything sort of slides into place (remarkably chick-flick-like) wouldn't feel so backwards.The main inhibitor throughout was the adorable Ginnifer Goodwin forcing the ""cute, ditzy girl"" act down people's throats as the principle character Gigi. Seriously, did the she lose a bet or something? She was great in 2005's Walk the Line, and now, for some reason, she's reduced to playing the love child of Elle Woods and Cher Horowitz. I suppose, to her credit, she was just trying her best with the source material. The screenwriters, it seems, wrote her character in circles. Just when she seemed to be losing her half-witted bowl-of-sugar sweetness and was close to behaving like an actual human being, she'd go right back to her old ways and make some other catastrophically bad decision. It was so hard to believe that any guy could possibly be ""into her"" that the amount of dates she goes on are simply ridiculous. Any person who is that incredibly out of touch with reality would, conceivably, have so many issues relating to the opposite sex that they would never date.As for the legions of other characters that bog down the heavy laden storyline, there are just so damn MANY of them that it's impossible for anyone to truly develop outside of superficial qualities. I would've liked to see far more of Drew Barrymore who's presence in heavily clichéd chick flicks has usually left me contented, and much less of the criminally overrated Scarlet Johanssen who manages to look even more like a Marilyn Monroe pop-art piece and less like a living, breathing person in every movie she stars in. Justin Long and Kevin Connolly, both blessed with boyish charm, don't get enough screen time to make any kind of impression. Jennifer Connelly's Jeanine is the most dull character in an already boring script (every time the poor girl was on screen I wanted to open a vein), and Bradley Cooper, typecast once again as the selfish, unprincipled guy is convincing enough, but, once again, the script is so flat that even his comedic chops can't lift it off the ground.Ben Affleck and Jennifer Aniston play the token married couple struggling with opposite ideas of commitment. For the life of me, I can't remember their characters names and that's my biggest problem with them. By the time their troubles come to fruition, nobody cares too much anymore. Admittedly, I enjoyed their subplot more than any of the other ones because it was genuinely sweet and seemed the least hackneyed of the other plot lines Basically, there's just one (or twoor threeor four) too many characters to possibly invest in all of them. The movie also seems to flip back and forth between drama and comedy, which gives the viewer no time to get into a mindset. The filmmakers did a terrible job of utilizing some of the natural charms and comedic ability of several of the actors (namely, Barrymore, Long, Connolly, and Aniston), which left all of them looking out of place.My grade: C+",He's Just Not That Into You
156,ramchandar_gl,"Nice acting, well directed. An excellent time-pass",7,12 February 2009,"After seeing the trailers you get a feel for what sort of a movie this is going to be. And the movie is exactly that - Nice romantic comedy.I usually prefer to watch such movies only in TV or DVD but gave this a try simply for the star cast - Scarlett, Jennifer Anniston and Connelly, Drew Barrymore, Ben Affleck, Justin Long etc..But the person who stole the show was Ginnifer Goodwin. She had a bubbly enthusiasm about her character which made you root for her till the end. Connelly's role looked very similar to her role in ""Little Children"" Scarlet was OK. Barrymore's role was minuscule but her pun about technology was humorous. And Anniston is finally looking her age :-( The movie was just the right length. Mildly funny but mostly romantic.

It makes all women out to be pathetic, needy twits, waiting by the phone, waiting to be wed, waiting to be asked out. How could these actresses in all good conscience appear in this movie? It's the most shallow meaningless thing I have ever seen on a screen. The relationship issues were not realistically dealt with; there was not any depth to any character or any incident; there was no moral to the story that was at all worthwhile.

She was also well balanced between Reality and Idealization. 2) Beth, I felt she was the most sane of the ENTIRE bunch. She knew what she wanted and when it was clear she wasn't going to get it from that guy she left. THAT is woman! 3) Connelly's character was weak for the most part but at the very ending she did exactly what I wanted her to do. Atta girl!

166,mellvsej,"Pretty good for a ""chick flick""",6,19 June 2009,"Even though I, myself am of the female sex, I am not one to enjoy chick flicks very often. I am usually more entertained by the horror and comedy genre. So when my friends told me they wanted to rent this one for movie night, I was pretty bummed out. It actually shocked me because I was entertained throughout the whole thing. The acting was good and the characters were actually pretty believable. The main thing that bothered me about this film was the lack of chemistry between some of the characters in their relationships. Jennifer Aniston and Ben Affleck had absolutely zero chemistry. The couple that was really genuine to me was that of Alex and Gigi.This whole film centers around relationships and I think that it could help show a few of us exactly what has gone wrong in past relationships. There is a little bit of everything in this movie, from cheating spouses, being the infamous other woman, someone not calling you back, and a long relationship without marriage. Almost every woman could relate to at least one of the problems mentioned in this film, which makes it more believable overall. Even though I wouldn't watch this over a good horror movie, it is one that I may watch again in the future.",He's Just Not That Into You
167,sunriseinyoureyes,An entertaining star-studded romcom with probably one too many story lines.,7,18 September 2017,"Overall I thought the acting was convincing and the writing was often insightful in its exploration of relationship dynamics, courtship conventions, and the unknowable fate of attraction. There were a few scenes of syrupy sentimentality and spoon-fed irony whose cringeworthiness was just bearable due to the scenes overtly climactic intent. But there were other intentionally uncomfortable scenes that accomplished exactly what they were meant to; I occasionally found myself hand over mouth or peaking at the screen through thin-split fingers. Given the number of story lines, there inevitably was more breadth than depth here (compensated for by the 2 hour length), but the characters were still relatable enough to sympathize with. A quick overview of the characters: couple Ben Affleck and Jennifer Aniston struggle with terms of commitment and how to move forward in a 7 year relationship. Bradley Cooper and Kristin Connelly second-guess the authenticity of their feelings toward each other years after their young and naïve marriage, now under the additional stress of a charming vixen outsider Scarlett Johansson who is basically looking for herself while dabbling in other people, namely Kevin Connolly (the quintessential nice guy who's missing something). Drew Barrymore is a somewhat spacey singleton looking for love on the internet. Justin long is a shallow, yet practiced lady's man who serves, kind of oddly, as counselor to our protagonist Ginnifer Goodwin, a high-strung yet sincere hopeless romantic frantically looking for her soul mate wherever she can. This movie was entertaining for sure. Not sure if there were any lessons or messages to take home in addition to the usual be honest with yourself and others. All considered, it's a good movie; worth 2 hours of life.",He's Just Not That Into You
168,justinalpertesq,Emotional Honesty,8,7 June 2009,"It would be easy just to dismiss He's Just Not Into You as a chick flick, but it deserves some greater attention. Here is an ensemble piece where one can easily picture Drew Barrymore cashing in all of her chits to pull this cast together. The effort, under the competent direction of veteran director, Ken Kwapis, was well worth it. The movie stylistically borrowed unapologetically from heavyweights of the romantic comedy genre (When Harry Met Sally, Thirtysomething), but succeeds in reaching points of honesty and uncertainty that one wouldn't normally expect to see from the genre.Quite simply, what can be taken from the movie, is that what ultimately makes any relationship successful or unsuccessful is unique to that relationship. There are stumbling blocks that cannot be overcome and there are road blocks that we are destined to forge through. The answer is never a general rule for everyone, but when the issues are dealt with in an all-too-hard-to-grasp state of emotional honesty, our comfort with the resolution, no matter how difficult, is assured.Having Jennifer Connelly and Jennifer Aniston together in a movie is a real treat for any red-blooded American man. I have had a crush on Miss Connelly since her debut as a young teenager in one of my all-time top films, Once Upon a Time in America, and spent most of my teen years formulating what I would say to her when I inevitably ran into her (still hasn't happened). Miss Connelly, as she always does, reached deep with this movie. It really is a shame that we never saw all that much of her in the past twenty years. Miss Aniston must be commended for the career choices that she has made. She continuously challenges herself with the roles she chooses and has differentiated her career from that of her other five ""Friends."" It is a pleasure to see Miss Aniston share the screen with Ben Affleck and show genuine affection for each other.Justin Long (I'm a Mac) takes a nice turn against type. Scarlett Johansson, as always, is genuine and wonderful. Bradley Cooper makes a fine performance and I am sure that we will be seeing him in leading roles in the future.Ultimately, it is great to see an ensemble piece with A-list actors actually work. This was not, emotionally, an easy movie to watch, but it dealt with relationships so honestly and effectively, and kept surprising me, that it was a wonderful movie to watch unfold. So, yes, it sure was a chick flick, but it was really one of the good ones.www.justinalpert.com",He's Just Not That Into You

177,SamanthaPrice,I'm just not that into it.,1,4 March 2010,"First I would like to say that I am a fan of Rom-Com's I eat them up, they are my adult fairy tale equivalent and I don't care if the premise is ""unrealistic"" or ""clichéd"", who cares? It's a Rom-Com!! But this? This film I found absolutely and completely offensive.*Contains Spoilers* I don't often, out rightly HATE movies, but I loath this film with a passion as unbridled as my love for this genre.Why? Well because apparently all women are neurotic, manipulative, brainless, unfulfilled and overly emotional and all men are lazy, commitment phobic, cheating, skirt chasers.ARGH!!! I saw it with two girl friends who didn't mind it, as they said, ""Just another brainless Rom-com"" but I can't just be that blasé about it. Just by chance myself and my friends were in each of the relationship premises, I was single, one friend had been with her BF for a few years and my other friend had recently gotten married.So apparently, I am destined to end up with a guy who eventually realises that the women he is chasing aren't chasing him back and deems me okay enough to go out with, after I in a fit of low self-esteem harangue and insult him. Yeah. THAT'S going to fill him with the warm and fuzzies about me.My friend who is living with her partner is destined to mope about trying to emotionally manipulate him into marriage, because lets face it, you aren't anyone unless you are married in your thirties. I do admit though, I did like the fact that Aniston's character breaks up with her partner because they don't want the same things, its an adult decision and I truly believed they both cared about each other and they were willing to work things out.Which brings me to the story that made me scream; because once women are married apparently we turn into brittle, screaming, untrusting harpies. Well I can't wait to walk down that aisle now. Oh the joys of a lifetime partnership. Connelly's character was thoroughly unlikable which unfortunately made you feel for her husband, charmingly played by Cooper, so when he starts his relationship with Scarlett whilst you know its wrong you can't quite feel that maybe he should just leave her. Are they just married because they don't know what else to do? She was controlling and manipulative, he in turn was apparently spineless and, I think unable to give up smoking for her. Personally out of his vices I think I would have preferred that he smoked rather than sticking it to young blondes.So in essence, this movie a life cycle of a relationship, once a guy deems you worthy enough of him to date, you will then have to emotionally manipulate him into marrying you, only for him to turn into a cheat and you break upand what? Start all that over again? No thanks.The other players in the movie are just background and aren't nearly quirky enough to warrant the time they get.The only real saving grace is that everyone in the movie can act, every character is portrayed by the actor well, it's just the material they are given to work with is terrible and nothing can save the plot lines.This movie didn't feel me with hope, leave me with that feel good factor, nor did it get me all weepy because I felt for the characters involved.I personally wouldn't bother again, which is a shame with all the talent they had.",He's Just Not That Into You

Now me I am not a huge fan of rom coms, but I have a month's free cinema pass and since the timing was good I went to see this. At the start the premise actually seemed interesting and that's the first few minutes when it’s the little kid. Downhill from there. I really do not get where this was going and what it's point was. I have never felt so depressed by characters in a film nor have I ever cringed so much at the predictability and utter lameness. The film reads like a sketch show of dysfunctional people and their relationships, all of them are miserable sods and I could not really feel any empathy for any one of them (well maybe, surprisingly for Afleck’s character who seemed neither idiotic, mean or pathetic like most of the others), partly as they all get so little screen time, due to the fact that there are so many of them! I rarely review films but I found this truly shocking. O.k I bet many people will go on a bout how subtle and realistic this film was and on the eclectic mix of personalities so cleverly interwoven.... Blimey I like films. I am a film buff. I really will watch anything. I even sat through some of those dire parodies around in the last few years.... Well exception to the rule seem to be films with Scarlett Johansson, don't know why but the girl is always some mistress, or third wheel or temptress... she seems to have a talent to ruin films for me. In this film she is almost as annoying as the pathetic needy girl but many times nastier. It would be good to see her cast as something other than a slut... even in Justin T's video she was a two timer, what gives? Cut the whole ludicrous crap with the love triangle with Scarlett (what's in a name? huh well) - married guy and stupid wife-y and this film would be o.k. I am going to try to catch the end of this when I have more patience, perhaps after on my free pass I have seen a hard core action or something... I really should have left much earlier but I wanted to give it a chance, the final straw was the wife reaction to the cheating it was just er so… blah... Complete anti climax and with the guy having everything all planed… It just rang fake. I do however want to find out how all of the losers ended up. But the creators what were they thinking?

Movie tries to tell us that ""What the men says and what the women gets?"" actually and that is a real story that we can see easily in our lives. ""If a man doesn't call you back it's because he doesn't want to see you again."" but if the man doesn't call women doesn't understand it that way because of the way they grew up and that's what the movie's story based on.

186,naimfan,Better and more thought-provoking than expected . . .,8,15 February 2009,"I just saw this with my girlfriend. We both enjoyed it, in my case, considerably more than expected after reading the slash and burn review in the New York Times. It is a genuinely funny movie that comes uncomfortably close to some of the realities of dating and relationships in the present.I'll refrain from talking about how the various plots interrelate, since other people have already discussed them. Suffice it to say that all the relationships in the film are, to a degree, stereotypical and hyperbolic--because without that exaggeration, the film wouldn't be nearly as funny. The opening scene is terrific--that the decision about whether to have another round or not has to be considered at all says everything needed about whether Conor is interested in seeing Gigi again--in a word, no. Gigi, of course, doesn't pick that up, and holds out hope, bordering on obsession, that Conor will call her back. When he does not, she ventures to a restaurant Conor had mentioned going to, and thus meets Alex, played by Mr. Mac, Justin Long, who begins to clue her in about what men really mean by action or inaction. And as you'll guess, *SPOILER ALERT* Alex and Gigi wind up together--seemingly inevitably.I really enjoyed Jennifer Aniston and Ben Affleck--I thought they had a wonderful sense of ease and chemistry together, and although you could see the end of their story a mile away, it was fairly well done, even if a bit cloying. My favorite acting, though, was by Jennifer Connelly, as Janine. Her progression to self-realization was spot on, and her and Bradley Cooper's relationship was (sadly) all too believable. I wasn't as taken by the characters played by Kevin Connolly, Scarlet Johansson, and Drew Barrymore (who seemed to wander in and out of the film somewhat randomly). While they all contribute important, and even critical, elements of the film, they didn't seem to have the same sense of ease with the situations the script put them in. For example, for Kevin Connolly to go from a ""player"" to someone modelling clothes to appeal to a gay market struck me as a bit far-fetched. The technical elements are quite good--sets, costumes, lighting, music, and so on. There are some beautiful shots. I also quite liked the convention of using normal people to talk about each titled section of the movie. For me, it gave it a good sense of flow and grounding, helping tie the mini-theme of each section into the tapestry of the film. That said, the various stories weave together and come together about as you'd expect-- there are not many surprises in how things turn out. But that isn't the point of a movie like this--which is to point out and make fun of some of the realities of dating and relationships that exist today, and how far people will go to avoid facing an unpleasant reality. It is not Ghandi, or Thelma and Louise, and it is not supposed to be. Overall, it is a fun movie to see, and more thought-provoking than I thought it would be. Good writing, good acting, and a good blending of the various elements involved. It reminds me of Love, Actually--which is a good thing in my view. Enjoyable, just be ready to realize how close you come to what's being made fun of and commented on . . .",He's Just Not That Into You
187,dks-18,light entertainment with a serious twist,7,15 March 2009,"This comes across as an unambitious film, the ""B-production"" sort of thing which ends up on DVD as soon as possible, giving some light practice to the star-studded cast between more serious projects. Having said that, it is a very well turned-out production, and the actors are obviously enjoying the roles, which heap one cliché upon another until the result gets a quality of its own. This is, I think, the way to go with clichés: avoid them if you have a point, but if the clichés are the point, go in all the way, and add more on top. Now in romantic comedy, the idea is that everything turns out well at the end, and no serious harm is done on the way. This is where this film is a cut above the genre, namely one particular character really gets hurt, and for a subtle and true-to-life reason: he lies one time too much. Romantic comedy is all about inner growth and coming to terms with oneself, so it gives a refreshing if somewhat bitter tang to the film to see, for once, what happens when one really cannot do that, including the collateral damage to others.Scarlett Johansson is cleverly cast, superficially the ""other woman"" and home-wrecker, her spontaneity ends up setting a serious moral standard. I was sorry to see Jennifer Connelly in yet another role of over-strained and somewhat manipulative wife - this sort of typecasting is not bringing out the best in her, in my view, though I can see why they want her that way. Finally, Kris Kristofferson and Jennifer Aniston as father and daughter - I seem to note some faint resemblance between the latter and the young Sarah Miles. Was something going on at the back of the casting director's mind, or is it just me?",He's Just Not That Into You
188,WilliamABW,"Silly, but surely recommended to anyone who knows what they're about to see",7,31 October 2010,"He's Just Not That Into You, a romantic comedy about nine ordinary people and typical relationship problems, has an ensemble cast that supports two entertaining and engaging story lines, and two far more uninteresting ones.One involves Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin), a young woman who frequently seeks relationship advice from her friend Alex (Justin Long). When Alex begins spending more time with her, Gigi excitedly and erroneously concludes that Alex is interested in her. Goodwin and Long both give solid performances. There are great scenes involving Alex's frank but realistic advice to Gigi, and a rather amusing scene in which Gigi passionately makes out with a very surprised and confused Alex. What's great about this storyline is that most of the words from Alex can actually pertain to real life.Ben (Bradley Cooper) is a man cheating on his wife Janine (Jennifer Connelly) with the young yoga instructor Anna (Scarlett Johansson). This is the storyline I felt most absorbed in, as all three characters were rather likable, contrary to what I would have expected. Although clichéd, there is a tense scene in which Anna hides in a closet of a small room Janine is walking around in - for obvious reasons, the whole audience is constantly thinking ""Don't open the door, don't open the door"" to themselves. Connelly gives a stand-out performance in this storyline.Unfortunately, two other, dull story lines take away space for the good ones to develop. One of these story lines involves Beth (Jennifer Aniston) breaking up with her boyfriend of seven years (Ben Affleck) when he refuses to get married. Affleck has very little screen time, Aniston having little more. The conflict itself is interesting, but its main problem is that it is underdeveloped. Another is about Mary (Drew Barrymore), who has problems with online dating. Like the Beth storyline, this is underdeveloped, but even more so. Although Barrrymore's acting is fine, she has, if I am remembering correctly, a grand total of four scenes in the whole movie.The worst part of He's Just Not That Into You is the third act. Two of the story lines in particular seemed to satisfyingly end realistically, but the characters end up contradicting themselves (and what appeared to be the whole message of the story) to create a generic Hollywood ending. Almost every character ends up with somebody else. Now, predictable or not, I love feel-good endings, but although there wasn't anything terrible about the way this film ended, it all felt very contrived and syrupy. In conclusion, even though too many characters take away development, He's Just Not That Into You is still pretty good as a romantic comedy, and is surely recommended to anyone who knows what they're about so see.",He's Just Not That Into You

This is a film made to make those millions of insecure over-analytical American women feel better about themselves and cash in on it. To sit and watch it is frightening. It paints women as swooning idiots and to be honest i tried watching this 3 times and just switched off every time (something like a fly landing on the chair next to me would become far more interesting). If you are an insecure over-analytical American woman then definitely watch this movie because honestly watching these idiotic characters will make you feel so much better about yourself.

190,tenacious_dummy,Gender stereotypes disguised as female empowerment,2,6 January 2012,"I have been skimming through this movie's reviews, and quite frankly, I am appalled by the positive feedback it received. Isn't this precisely the type of Mars & Venus gender-dividing gibber gabber women have been trying to contradict in the actual world for the past few decades? Do we seriously still believe that men and women are so intrinsically different that we speak and behave in ways incomprehensible to one another?The central story of Gigi and Alex is so vapid. While Alex so ""generously"" attempts to explain to Gigi how there are simple rules to male behavior (implying, of course, that women unnecessarily complicate things) and that one of them is the ""he's just not that into you"" catchphrase, he is doing so without any real argument. The one thing he has to say in his defense is ""it's just how we do it."" His only rationale is being a guy. When he ultimately comes to Gigi's apartment where she is apparently waiting to be rescued from her pointless singlehood, he seals her lips with a kiss, while she exclaims ""I am the exception!"" Yeah, Gigi, you sure are... Congrats!And so, while we are persuaded throughout this excuse for a movie that we are never the exception, suddenly exceptions are springing up all over the place, and everyone (well, almost everyone, someone had to be the scapegoat) is tucked into their nice, comfy, little conventional lies/lives, and they all live happily ever after. The only relationship I could sort of recognize as ""real"" is the Aniston-Affleck combo, but they had to ruin it with his predictable proposal in the end. Why couldn't he just come back and tell her that if he doesn't want to get married, it's because marriage to him is only a formality, and that if they don't stay together it's because she quit on him, not the other way around? But I guess such an ending would not be considered happy by Hollywood standards...",He's Just Not That Into You
191,punkfish999,A Dud.,3,5 April 2012,"The film starts off with a young girl being introduced to the idea of relationships - we are then shown a series of women from around the globe with friends that lie to hide the truth. When we are eventually introduced to the main character I instantly want to change channel, Gigi could quite possibly be the most annoying person I have ever seen before in my life. Her inability to accept rejection and her blatant desperation leaves you feeling slightly scared. Gigi is what is wrong with women (I am a woman and spend ages listening to other women pouring over details just like she does, and the man in question just isn't interested) and does not offer any counterbalancing behaviour to make up for the fact she has psychotic tendencies. I'm sure Goodwin is a great actress, and this is not a dig at her, just at the role she played. I was relieved when the film ended - i'd had had enough of her inability to think for herself and feel sorry for the semi-decent character she ended up with.The rest of the characters have watchable tales that are all predictable, nothing takes you by surprise maybe apart from the ending which is rather dull and makes you wonder why you bothered. Jennifer Aniston plays her usual role - nothing new there. Ben Affleck plays the stereotypical Hollywood married man - unhappy with a wondering eye, married to a stone that only ever shows emotion when she is angry and smashing things up. I was also wanting something more from the Dialouge, sometimes it's not clear what's going on (the cigarette problem) and other times a simple point is spelled out to you multiple times. Too many characters with too many problems and i struggle to see how this movie even made it into cinemas. I continued watching to the end just to say that I had seen it.

Now, the reason that I like it: the movie portrays the lives of real people. Girls, come on, get real, don't tell me you have never ever lied to a friend about a guy they liked and you knew right off the bat that he didn't. Guys, we know that you're so scared by everything about relationships: the commitment, opening up to someone with your heart at stake and the biggest of all, the break-up. O.K. it's not a big part of the movie and no one really breaks up with someone face to face but to quote Carrie Bradshaw ""Have the guts and the courtesy to tell a woman, to her face, that you no longer want to see her"". And this one is for all of you out there: Do NOT get involved with a married person. You know that you're going to get your heart broken, so why do it? And no, it's not complicated, it's not different and it's not special, the person you're having a relationship with has taken a vow to stand by, love and cherish someone else. Their vow also includes being loyal to one another but guess what, they're cheating on their spouse with you! Now even if that person divorces and marries you, how do you think that the same thing won't happen to you? How can you be sure that they will keep their vow the second time around? How will you know that they are not just another cheater? Let's face the truth, we all need to get a grip and stop playing childish games with one another, doesn't matter if you got a pee-pee or a vajayjay.

196,hollzee01,Was that supposed to be entertaining?,1,21 November 2009,"Because it really wasn't.Firstly, the characters were so annoying that you can't connect with them in any way, shape or form and the fact that there were so many of them made it a whole lot worse. I think at the start of every scene (and i mean EVERY scene) in the movie, I thought ""So, where are we now? Who are *these* people? What's happening?"" There were simply far too many story lines happening at once, and none of the characters were interrelated, which made me even more confused as to why there were so many things happening at once.Secondly, it dragged. It dragged so much that I kept looking at my phone for the time and thinking, ""Oh, that's good, only 20 minutes left. It's about time!"" The length of the film was so long that I could have easily fallen asleep, because the movie bored me so much.Which is the next point I will be addressing (the boring one, that is). Yes, this has been said many times before, but watching grass grow would be more entertaining. I thought romantic comedies were supposed to be funny? I guess not. There were maybe one or two funny moments in the whole film. There were moments that the whole cinema chuckled a bit, and I thought ""Gosh, these people will laugh at anything, even growing grass!"" But if you're not going to have many funny moments, at least have interesting story lines, at least one. But, no, the story lines were so lame and pointless that I was tempted to walk out (but being the person I am I decided to get my money's worth, and also I already told my dad when he would pick me up).Another point, which doesn't have to do with the movie, everyone loves it. I don't understand why you would. No, I am not a 40-year-old man who was dragged to this movie by his wife or anything. I am a 17-year-old girl who payed $15 (rip-off right? Especially for this!) to see this movie with a whole group of friends. What I don't understand is that they all loved it. Not just them, but every person I spoke to. Sure, everyone is entitled to his or her opinion, but I honestly don't see any reason at all why anyone would find this entertaining.In conclusion, you can see this movie if you REALLY want to, but if you want my opinion, don't.Thanks for reading :)",He's Just Not That Into You
197,tubsuk,"A waste of money, but a nice day out.",3,20 June 2009,"This film was poor at best. I had no intentions of seeing this it but had a day to kill in Birmingham, UK and this was the only movie on at the pictures. The real entertainment that came from seeing this film was the people of Birmingham in the movies who passed comment on every part of it and the girls sat in the front screaming 'no' or gasping at the slightest overenthusiastic hammy acting of any of the B+ list cast. However, this is unfair to the producers of this contemporary tour de force. After all it was their shoddy film that provided the real entertainment; the kind that apparently money can buy. The acting as aforementioned was hammy and even laughable in some instances and the plot was bad in general. I thought it was particularly amusing that Jennifer Aniston and Ben Affleck were really just part of the film to increase revenue and their characters could have been written out with no impact on the story whatsoever. I think a better film would've concentrated more on just one of the seemingly tens of sub plots the movie had, and even then, it would have been nothing out of the ordinary. It was a highly successful film but I doubt whether or not it will go down in history as a timeless classic... or even a modern great. On the plus side this film has inspired me to work very hard in all that I do, for if a few numbskulls can put a few idiotic story lines together to make a film that sucks this badly so successful, then imagine what one with any degree of intelligence could do with ambition. Despite my low rating of this film I must say it is worth a watch, because then you will understand what I mean, have a better idea of the fact that bar staff can afford to live in luxury apartments, be entertained with what should be a B movie and just be inspired, knowing full well you could be a better director, producer, actor, writer, recruiter or just anything to do with making a movie and you'd do a better job than the jokers in charge of this.",He's Just Not That Into You

Some of their actions were so unbelievably stupid that I just wanted to smack them. And what shallow lives they lived! Work, bar-hopping and texting. Character development was equally shallow. What epiphany did the Justin Long character undergo to realize that he was really ""into"" the Ginnifer Goodwin character? One confused meeting with the wait staff does not an epiphany make. The same goes for the Jennifer Aniston character realizing what a catch Ben Affleck's character was. So he washed some dishes.

Right, I agree that some dialogues sound plain (although I watched the movie dubbed and it may be the reason...). Most of the characters are exaggerated.

But then again, this is a movie about love, commitment, relationships, dating and so forth.. Where others see lack of depth, I see diversity of substance. I connected with this movie because, even though stories about each and every relationship can fill hours of storytelling, on a personal level, i feel that most relationship stories can be told or characterized by a simple thought. A simple idea/feeling/problem that made the love story have a happy ending or not. By watching how these many stories unfold, i felt i could relate to many of them at the same time. Instead of feeling a lack of connection or interest about the movie, I was actually overwhelmed by how it made me feel sadness and joy, hope and melancholy.

207,artsypeachh,No thank you ma'am,1,3 April 2020,"I began watching this movie with low expectations, despite it having a fairly promising little trailer on Netflix, and I can truly say that this movie has mediocre dialogue, horrible and disrespectful male characters and sad and lonely desperate female characters (and a whole lotta talent wasted).The basic premise of this movie is to challenge how we view rejection as seen from a woman's point of view. It begins with a childhood scene of boy bullying girl, and mom telling girl its because ""he likes you"", the narrator is dumbfounded at this notion. So we are actually promised a sort of ""feminist"" (I daresay) outlook on this issue of heterosexual dating.Unfortunately this premise turns sour real quick as we see Ginnifer Goodwin desperately clinging to a date that clearly doesn't want to call her but rather wants a bootycall with Scarlett Johanson.I only managed to watch this movie until about 1 hour in, because Bradley Cooper's character, who also claims to be in a ""good marriage"", after literally letting another woman know that he is tempted to cheat with her, says that no man ever wants to marry because they'll end up regretfully looking at all the women they wish they could be with.Honestly, this movie is filled with men who are trashy and unappealing (personality wise) and I have no idea how they got such famous actors and actresses to play such awful roles. The women? They have zero substance, besides the desperation to get a date or to secure a marriage, despite their boyfriend ""not believing in the concept of marriage"" not one bit.My favourite part probably has to be, that despite this movie being clearly directed at women, to recognise the fact that men just might not like them and that socially we are trained to believe that no matter how many times a man steps over us and discards us, we should still hold out foolish hope that he will come running to us, Ginnifer Goodwin's character receives some advice. And who is it from? Of course, a man who like every other man, discards women and is there for a fun time and not a long time as a committed person in a relationship.
So it takes a trashy man, to make a woman realise that she has self-worth (whatever that even means considering this movie), to get herself away from men who clearly are faking any interest in her? Groundbreaking. 10/10 feminism.Anyway, don't waste time watching this.Also! Love that one part when Bradley Cooper's character dresses up in a tight purple shirt and skinny jeans and claims to be aiming his work more at the LGBTQI community, and how he is diverse by basically ""making himself look gay"" whatever that even means. Really original making fun of LGBTQI persons, I just simply couldn't stop laughing (not).The only good thing about this movie is honestly Jennifer Anniston and Drew Barrymore because they're just so talented, and I wish someone could just write fully rounded female characters for them to portray.",He's Just Not That Into You

This attempt at romantic comedy falls desperately flat. For a film that wants so badly to be a lighthearted comedy, the laughs here are manufactured and weak. Random pop culture references and platitudes pepper this movie like a minefield, leaving its viewers stone-faced.Several different characters are shown here in various relationships, and bizarrely collide by the end of the film. Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin) is typecast as the desperate woman who sits by her phone for days waiting for that guy from the bar to call her back. This empty portrayal alone is enough to garner offense from women everywhere. She's shown as a sad, immature woman who has nothing better to do than to wait for Mr. Right.Then there's Beth (Jennifer Anniston) who is in a long-term relationship with Neil (Ben Affleck), who refuses to walk down the aisle. Beth is the stereotypical woman longing to drag her man to the altar. Jump to Ben (Bradley Cooper) and Janine (Jennifer Connelly), who are unhappily married, yet avoid addressing the obvious. Believe it or not, Ben is led astray by a blonde bombshell in the form of Anna (Scarlett Johansson). This collaboration of boring, typical connections is nothing that hasn't been seen and done before.""He's Just Not That Into You"" is derived from a book by the same name, written by Greg Behrendt. The basic premise of this book is to educate women of the fact that men are dishonest jerks who seek to take advantage of them and/or break their hearts. Somehow, this man has managed to not only make a killing with his mind-numbing book, but also to capitalize on it by bringing it to the big screen. The by-product of this is a sad excuse for a romantic comedy.The cast of ""He's Just Not That Into You"" reads like a who's who of Hollywood. Drew Barrymore, Scarlett Johansson, Ben Affleck, Jennifer Anniston and Justin Long are just a few of the A-listers seen here. This simply adds to the mystery of why this movie is such a catastrophe. Apparently no amount of talent could have kept it afloat. The flat script, the forced humor, the clichéd situations and the confused intertwining of the characters all add to this disparaging production.Although it is disguised as a fun loving date movie, ""He's Just Not That Into You"" spends most of its hour and a half running time over-analyzing simple encounters, patronizing and generalizing both sexes, and placing stereotypes everywhere. The concept of love is sent through the shredder and comes out completely destroyed on the other side. ""He's Just Not That Into You"" vainly attempted to be touching and warm hearted, but comes across as bitter and contrived.Possibly if viewers check their brain at the door, they can enjoy this film. Otherwise, save your money and your dignity by skipping this mushy mess.Grade: D",He's Just Not That Into You
210,flyswatter33,Disgracegul!,3,9 February 2009,"Now yes, I understand this was a ""chick flick"" and that because I'm a guy, the stereotype is that I shouldn't enjoy this movie in the first place. But I don't mind a chick flick every once in awhile. I hated this movie because of the way it portrayed relationships. The message was basically saying that breakups, divorce, and cheating are all perfectly fine. I was disgusted by the fact that throughout parts of this movie one particular man was encouraged to cheat on his wife. Now I understand that today society finds that acceptable, but I myself still have some character and integrity and would never do such a thing to my wife. Also I disagreed with the character Alex who basically represented men. Saying such things as, ""if hasn't called, he won't"" or ""if he's leaving on a trip then he does't care about you"" and that most guys just go through women like they go through a roll of toilet paper! It's great at the time, but otherwise, who needs it? At least until next time! I ended up leaving this move early. I sat through about 2 hours of though so i did get most of the story. I exited the theater when the cheating husband pulled the women he was having an affair with into his office and proceeded to undress her. My best guess would be that they eventually had sex (which they already did earlier in that movie). I just couldn't stand watching it anymore. I had gone with my girlfriend and some of her friends form school and she ended up staying for the whole thing, but said that she was glad that I had left the movie early because she hated it too! This is the kind of movie for those girls who are desperate for a relationship. It just depicts men as all being dicks to make them feel better that they're relationship isn't working. And you could definitely tell that it was a love drunk women who helped write this movie. I was very disappointed by this movie. I think I laughed one time in the time that I was there and that was just a small giggle under my breath. Overall I gave this a movie a three just because it did have some clever humor here and there (whether I laughed or not) and because I figured at least it wasn't as bad as Disaster Movie (not even comparable) But I would say if you had to see a movie, go to Taken! That's at least worth the money! And if you absolutely have to see this movie, wait for it to come out on video. Otherwise just do yourself a favor and skip it entirely!",He's Just Not That Into You
211,tashazanob,Pretty good adaptation.,6,9 February 2009,"I went to see this movie after being a HUGE fan of the book. I enjoyed it because, although the points were a bit exaggerated at times, I could identify with the characters. I have dated the commitment phobes, the married man (who conveniently forgot to mention that), the guy who just wanted me around to ""cuddle"" but couldn't think of having sex with me. The movie shed light on all these things in a way that makes you realize how ridiculous relationships can be. I thought the acting was good. The character Gigi was a bit 'over the top', but everyone played their parts in a believable fashion. I enjoyed it, and recommend it as a girls night out- probably not a couple movie.",He's Just Not That Into You
212,VishalTrivedi,A good romantic comedy!,7,15 February 2009,"I happened to see this movie with my wife on Valentine's day. I had entered the theater with low expectations and the only reason I was keen to watch this was because of Ben Affleck and host of other starts. However, as the movie progressed I found myself starting to like it. By the time it ended I was glad it didn't turn out to be just another stupid romantic comedy made to pull the audiences with big stars.The story is not new yet the script is cleverly written as it juggles between couples all somehow intertwined/related with each other added with nice style of presenting it, thus keeping the viewer interested.The characters are from a wide range of people we encounter in real life. Alex, a guy who's an 'expert' on relationships. He keeps himself away from emotional attachments, runs a bar and plays an agony aunt to Gigi; a lady desperately seeking a soul mate. Next is Beth, Gigi's friend cum co-worker who is in a relationship with Neil since seven years and is very keen to tie the knot as opposed to Neil who loves Beth, is loyal to her but believes marriage is not an assurance of loyalty. This fact is proved by Ben; Neil's friend who's married to Janine (who also happens to be Gigi's co-worker) for around 8 years, but falls for Anna. Next follows a typical chase of 'A' following 'B', 'B' following 'C', hidden meanings, signs, a little humor here and there and related stuff.Performances in this movie are fine by everyone if not exceptional. Ben Affleck and Drew Barrymore play their parts with ease. I liked Drew's small part, especially where she expresses her frustration with today's increasing use of technology which is leading people apart as opposed to bringing them together. Justin Long impresses with his performance and Scarlett Johansson is convincing as the temptress. The rest of the cast also do not disappoint as well.What I didn't like about this movie was its length which I found to be a bit long. Also, the soundtrack of this movie is not very impressive, with a couple of exceptions. Finally it would've helped if it would have been more funny.I would recommend this fresh take on love, romance, loyalty, marriage and things similar, to anyone who is looking for a good romantic comedy.",He's Just Not That Into You

He may be a child, but he can smell a mess as well as any adult. Even she, the First Fan of Chick Flicks, apologized for it and thanked him for hanging in there until the end.I really like a good story, whether it is aimed at me or not, when it gets me bonded to the people in it. However, I found it difficult to connect with any of the characters in this show because it was like the first day at a new job: Within forty minutes I met fifty people. At the end of two hours I could barely remember any of them. The ones who made the deepest impression were those with the best quips. And those were not among the (fourteen!) main characters. Call me slow witted and possessed of a short attention span, but it might have been good to limit the number of primary folks to six or so, or to keep them all geographically close, or both. That way, I could have focused my attention a lot better.The long and short of it is that there are plenty of faces I have enjoyed watching in the past (particularly Ginnifer Goodwin) and will enjoy watching again, just not this time.Also, Jennifer Connelly, please eat something.",He's Just Not That Into You

I thought HJNTIY was wonderful, with true/funny lines, great cast, and good ending. People actually clapped at the end. I liked the format which was broken into titled sections, with interjections of ""real"" women sharing their thoughts - hilarious. Who can't relate to any of these relationship experiences? At the theater (mostly filled with women, ha) there were collective gasps and sheepish glances between friends. It was neat how the characters' lives were interrelated, and the story lines were NOT predictable. Watch for the little extras during credits.**SPOILERS** Critics who say this movie makes women look dumb are ignoring the fact that each of the female characters grows by the end of this movie. Yes, at first Gigi is overly passionate about being with someone/anyone, but throughout the movie she is coached by Alex and ends her last random date like a star student. At first, Beth views a wedding ceremony as the ultimate proof of love and commitment, but... At first, Janine is anxious about her husband perhaps not loving her enough, viewing her self-worth through his eyes - which makes the mirror scenes very significant. Anna, too, is seeking true love, but at the end is pursuing her own dream of singing.",He's Just Not That Into You

I have read the book, get the concept being a single woman myself and I still can not fathom what a snore this movie was. While the concept of ""he's just not into you"" is one women should get everywhere Gigi's role was insane and did not portray the mainstream single girl in America. While we do wonder if he is going to call most of us are not nearly as desperate as this character. The only bright spot in this movie was Jennifer Aniston and Ben Affleck's relationship.

It's a two hour soap opera of who's sleeping with who and I'll forgive the ""Big"" mistakes as long as you don't lie about the ""little"" things. If actual people are as dumb, emotionally messed up and desperate as they are in this movie, then I feel sad for the state of the world.

Some of the lines are priceless, and a couple of the funniest scenes in the movie involve ""street interviews"" à la Sex and the City Season 1. It's just an easy, fun, entertaining film--just relax and enjoy yourself, and don't try to hold this movie to a standard that it wasn't designed to meet.

The movie is suitable to single women who are not successful in making a lover, but try to pursue their real love. In the movie, there are some women with different love troubles in her daily life. Almost all women wonders why her boyfriend doesn't propose to marry or why he does not call after a blind date even though he says he will call you back. The movie sum up only one sentence about these kinds of scenes. 'He is just not that into you!!!'By watching the movie, I surprised many times because the main characters seem like me whenever they meet boyfriend. For example, many women think that he likes me when several men care you and show good manner. In this way, Movie's characters often misunderstand such things.

227,stephen-heisey,Holy God that was terrible,1,8 June 2009,"Before I can even begin a criticism of the movie I have to ask: How can woman enjoy, and support, this film? The movie portrays women has whiny, desperate, and pathetic creatures who do nothing besides gossip and give each other relationship pep talks. The scenes where Jennifer Anniston, Jennifer Connelly, and Ginnifer Goodwin are in the office where they are employed are perfect examples of this. Despite being educated, professional women, instead of working, they spend all their time discussing their relationships and consoling one another. As a young adult male I can honestly say that this is the kind of portrayal of women which makes men not take them seriously. The fact that women support and like this movie only gives further credence to these clearly prejudiced beliefs. So again how can women support a movie which portrays them so poorly? It makes about as much sense to me as Muslims supporting a movie about three young, college educated Arab men who work in the same office and spend all of their time making bombs and planning terrorist attacks. Now that that's out of the way, my major problem with the movie is that it has easily the worst script ever committed to screen. There is not an original bit of dialogue to be found anywhere. All of the characters are completely generic and unoriginal. Ginnifer Goodwin plays the crazily desperate woman, Jennifer Connelly is the woman who is cheated on, Benn Affleck plays the man scared of commitment, and Kevin Connolly plays the man chasing the woman who he will never get... I could go on, but honestly, why bother? The only exception to this is Drew Barrymore's character, which plays no important role in the movie at all. It seems like she went to the producers after the movie was already completed and said: ""Hey I want to be in this movie, I'll pay you fifty million dollars if you give me a part."" They agreed, shot two scenes where three multi-racial, stereotypical gay men give her dating advice and pep talks, and one scene where she and Kevin Connolly fall for each other completely out of the blue and for no other reason than that every major character needed to be in a couple when the movie ended. The other major flaw with the movie is that it is one of those rare romantic comedies which manages to be completely and totally devoid of humor. I only chuckled twice during the movie. Twice. In two hours. Two chuckles, not even real laughs, just quiet chuckles. TwoFinally, it was obvious to me immediately after glancing at the DVD case that the movie was going to be clever and totally original combination of Sex and the City and Love Actually. I was right.

It's telling women to stop idealizing situations and creating romance out of things that don't exist. Only so that, at the end, they all end up in a romantic relationship.If the movie really wanted to make a valid point to women - The final message should have shown how happy the women are (or could be) once they learn to see how much better life is by learning to love themselves (by themselves) and stop spending every second searching for romance.By having them find relationships at the end the movie, it still leaves an impression of hope for women to keep searching for love, romanticizing; instead of conveying a message that women should stop exaggerating crushes, stop waiting on men hand and foot, and start gaining independence and self dignity.",He's Just Not That Into You

Even when powerful people are against his views, he always sticks by them because he believe his opinion is correct.

235,oremfrien,Oh Joy!,4,10 March 2020,"I am personally the kind of person who loves watching trainwrecks of characters for the purposes of self-entertainment and, if you do, too, come join me. In that, redeems itself from being a near unwatchable and convoluted disaster (that's why I gave it four-stars). Obviously spoilers. And I cannot remember the characters' names for the life of me, so I will use the actors' names.So the movie starts with three women and three men (and Barrymore occasionally thrown in) in the strangest relationship centipede ever pantomimed. It turns out that Connelly (f) is married to Cooper (m) who Johansson (f) fawns over when she, in turn, is fawned over by Connolly (m) who has a date with Goodwin (f) whose future trajectory she is wondering about, so she consults with Long (m) who ends up desiring her. You almost expect the resolution of such a contorted mess to be that they all end up at the same musical concert and recognize what's been going on. It is bizarre for numerous reasons that I will discuss forthwith:Connelly and Cooper's plotline is supposedly about adultery, but it actually isn't. We see how Connelly reacts when Cooper admits that he had an affair, which is to say that she barely has a response. Compare that to, in the same conversation, the allegation that he is a smoker. She eventually verifies this by discovering the largest Costco size box of cigarettes conceivable (it must contain at least 10,000 individual cigarettes) and divorces him. Because this is the ""actual"" breakup, the adultery has no sting to it. The two of them were in a loveless perfunctory marriage and, if the screenwriters had decided to play it as a dead-bedroom story where Connelly discovers the need for emotional intimacy before being blindsided by the affair, perhaps that would have had weight. Instead, Connelly reads really strangely for caring significantly more about lung cancer than about fidelity in a relationship. Cooper, stupidly, did not throw out his gigantic box of cigarettes (or bring it to work with him) when Connelly first discovered the cigarettes, which makes this even more bizarre as he could have avoided the divorce wholesale otherwise.Then you have the Johansson plotline which makes her out to be a complete a**hole that we are supposed to have sympathy for. She leads on Connolly, knowing that he is infatuated with her because she likes getting foot rubs. She pursues Cooper, who she knows is married, because they had one good conversation at a supermarket checkout counter. He literally does everything to avoid being in a relationship with her to the point where she has to flaunt her naked body at him to get him to sleep with her. Then when she is forced to confront that Cooper has a wife and calls him disgusting, which is absurd since she knew he was married in the first place. She then decides to go with Connolly as the ""safe"" option. Then she finally realizes (when he is prepared to buy a home) that leading on a man she doesn't want isn't really ethical and breaks up. Somehow, in all of this, none of the characters call her out on how much an a**hole she is.Next you have the short moment where Connolly goes out on a date with Goodwin, which makes absolutely no sense. He is still ""courting"" Johansson at this time and is expecting her to come back into his life as his girlfriend, so dating Goodwin is an odd choice. If he wanted sex, there are dozens of websites he could go to for that, but dating is for something more emotional and Connolly expects to get that from Johansson, not Goodwin, so why would he take her to a nice restaurant and spend money on Goodwin for a date he expects to have no long-term implications. He is clearly only on that date to connect Goodwin tangentially to the rest of the centipede and not because he has legitimate motivation to be there.Moving on to Goodwin and Long, this is the only pair of characters that I was remotely rooting for. Goodwin and Long discuss how Connolly is not going to call her and, instead of mentioning that Connolly is his roommate and so he knows Connolly personally, Long just tells her the one good piece of advice in the movie: if he's interested he would call and make a second date happen. She then decides to make him her sensei and he appears to enjoy helping her out, but it is very much a student-master situation. Long has the magical power to intuit how everyone feels around him and Goodwin is naively still looks for signs. She decides that he wants something more and is confronted by a nasty response on his part because she confused storge for eros. That's where this should have ended, but because we are in a romantic comedy, everything changes. While Long explained that she was the rule, not the exception, she actually becomes the exception. The wily Long actually does harbor eros for her and chases her.Entirely separately, and almost so wholly unrelated that you wonder whether it was bolted onto this movie in post-production, Aniston and Affleck have been in a relationship for seven years that appears to be really great except that she wants him to put a ring on it and he has a philosophical objection to it. So, of course, after Affleck gives her a moving speech about how committed he is to her, regardless of the ring, (which would have preceded a cliched make-out scene in any other film) she dumps him and forces him to move off to his houseboat, just in time to make her dateless for her sister's wedding. Because we all know that becoming dateless before a wedding from a relationship of seven years due to an offhanded comment at the workplace is exactly the choice any woman would make (sarcasm).After the wedding, she ""discovers"" that Affleck is actually the most amazing man in this movie, which considering that his function is literally to be the perfect man with no other characteristics, it surprises us movie-goers in taking Aniston so much time to come to this conclusion. Of course, when Affleck comes back into her life, his one unique character trait (wanting to be committed without involving the government) goes away and he decides he will get married. This is confusing and completely irrational. The entire catharsis of the Aniston-Affleck relationship was Aniston's realization that having a wedding ring does not actually signify a meaningful relationship and this is completely up-ended by Affleck now embracing marriage.Each plotline is resolved by just ignoring the central conflict it raises: Connelly and Cooper never actually deal with his infidelity; Johansson never apologizes for starting an adulterous affair or leading on a man she does not love; Connolly never discovers what was fundamentally wrong with being a doormat; Goodwin still relies on signals as opposed to more sanguine dating advice; Long abandons his own ship; and the marriage issue between Affleck and Aniston is resolved by Affleck compromising on his values with no apparent explanation that actually confronts his prior set of values. So, well done, folks.",He's Just Not That Into You
236,Trackerhead,OK for the genre....but AwFuL for me!,2,20 February 2009,"This film was awful. I was warned by my friend teacher who doesn't like Jen Aniston not to go watch it. I'm someone who does Film Studies and actually went to go watch it cos Jen Aniston is in it. But this film was so ghastly. Personally, It was not predictable since I don't have experience in love but generically, this was predictable but too much of a waste of time for nearly 2hrs of screen time. Too many star names (Barrymore and Johansson - I mean are u serious!!!!) and the fact that not that they can't act, but for this genre, it wasn't necessary. Too many star persona distract you from the actual story/narrative. I don't know about anyone else, but it was a bit like the Oceans film series with Brad Pitt, George Clooney and the others. Just sometimes too distracting. But this was just AWFUL. AND I MEAN IT. I ACTUALLY DOZED OFF HALF WAY THROUGH THE FILM! BUT, do go see it for chick-flick, I mean maybe it was just me. I never come one her but I decided to do so for once.",He's Just Not That Into You
237,bobbidowd,This talks about how bad I hated the movie,1,24 October 2015,This movie SUCKS!!!!! the couple we all love doesn't end up together but everyone else in the entire freaking movie does. Its SOOOOO stupid. I am so angry right now. At the end it tells you to not loose hope but I just lost and chance of hope I have ever had and will ever have. I do not recommend this movie to anyone with ears or eyeballs. This director sucks! I don't how you ever got a job and how you made a movie. Soooooo angry right now. I don't know how you made it as profesinonal write or even a person in today's age. And no this review won't let me say 'prohibited' words but just know I got a few for you buddy. I'm so sad I wanna cry. So ya.,He's Just Not That Into You
238,mubaristc,How that can be so perfect ending for all of them?,10,1 December 2017,"It was a amazing movie and wonderful cast. And it was about how some sort of people s from different situations are being in the relationships. do they like it? or what if they don't? how they are comfortable with that? some thing like that. Totally in my opinion ts was a kind of movie you would say after watching that ,it was the perfect ending for it or for all of the five women's and 4 men's.And i just love Barrymore.",He's Just Not That Into You
239,maryharris-29258,decent,6,16 November 2015,"The film was adapted from the self-help book by Greg Behrendt and Liz Tuccillo. The book itself was inspired by the line, and then the episode of the series Sex and the City. A series of seen male-female situations are intertwined in an interesting way, but this does not diminish the impression of sterility which is so clichéd scenes evoke the average viewer that can be recognized by almost everyone. As first act cute but over time appears unfulfilled need to incarnate in a somewhat real characters. So although you don't expect real characters from romantic comedies, we lack at least the semblance of reality, almost completely absent in this handy work.What gives a refreshing note to the entire film is the cast, which includes well-known names such as Ben Affleck, Scarlett Johansonn, Jennifer Aniston and others. High performance cast persuades us to turn a blind eye on the defects including somewhat forcing the performance of actress who can not resist us every now and then do not honor distinct gleam in his eye, not guarded for something more special occasions. And almost all of them do, and do, remembering that at least one moment in which we realized pessimistic conclusion pronounced the title. Therefore, despite the mixed figures this movie can be considered feminine and just such a public address recommendations for viewing.",He's Just Not That Into You

241,s-70815,The most stupid movie I had watched ever,1,24 March 2020,"This movie is always trying to tell you something but they make it all wrong. First of all, it said that marriage is just a show for some people who don't have confidence to each other. It is how marriage work ok? It is a legal way to ensure you and your partner's right. Also there is a laby saying that no one dead becouse of picking up unknown call. Ton of people die for it ok? It really make me mad by sending this misleading message",He's Just Not That Into You
242,tomosborn-05359,Life is too short,1,23 August 2021,"I'm writing this while the film is still on, because I've already wasted too much of my life watching it. I honestly don't know what upset me more between the p*ss poor acting, the paint-by numbers script, the student-level direction, the first-draft dialogue or the shockingly one-dimensional stereotypical, arc-less characters.There was one redeeming feature of the film, and that was when Scarlett Johansson and Bradley Cooper talk by a wall outside the supermarket, it's a nice wall. I feel I'm less intelligent than I was before this film started. It's over 2 hours.",He's Just Not That Into You

244,bookwormfreak112,"""The Mind of Men and Woman 101""",8,6 February 2009,"At first glance, ""He's Just Not That Into You"" has the right combination for a run-of-the-mill romantic comedy: a top-notch cast (including Ben Affleck, Jennifer Aniston, Justin Long, among others), a cute love story, and a number of miscommunications and one-liners to get the audience laughing.However, it's not just another romantic comedy. Instead, it has the rather bizarre mixture of being both a documentary and farce on the way men and women obsess over trying to decode one another.""He's Just Not That Into You"" tells a number of different story arcs between couples. Beth (Aniston) wants her longtime boyfriend Neal (Affleck) to propose to her. Ditzy Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin) tries to look for a guy who will call back after the first date, with the unexpected help of the bartender Alex (Long). Ben (Bradley Cooper) is torn between his wife Janine (Jennifer Connelly) and the beautiful Anna (Scarlett Johansson). The list goes on and on. In a style like 2002's ""Love, Actually,"" all arcs are interconnected in some way. The film does a good job of keeping all the stories straight without confusing anyone by giving each character a distinct personality and smoothly transitioning between each story.What makes this film stand out above others, however, is its exploration into the minds of men, women and their relationships that is on par with the 1989 comedy ""When Harry Met Sally."" It shows a reality of how each tries to dissect what the other is trying to communicate - what the guy means when he says ""it was nice to meet you"" after the date, for example. Ladies, how many times have you sat around with your friends going over every single detail to figure out how a guy feels about you? Gentlemen, how many times have you been perplexed by the actions of the opposite sex? This film seems to understand and laugh at your pain the same way your best friend might over drinks.The actors play their parts well, giving them a personality that's realistically flawed and charming. The character Gigi, for example, is that one over-analyzing, guy-crazy, slightly pathetic friend most people know. Goodwin gives her character just the right amount of sweetness for us to still enjoy her even though she makes embarrassing mistakes and has slight stalker-like tendencies.This film is a great date movie. It is funny enough for guys to laugh at, and has an ""aww"" factor most girls enjoy.And if nothing else, you'll learn a little something.",He's Just Not That Into You
