0,MartinHafer,Exciting but I've also seen elements of this film is several other productions.,7,29 April 2014,"""Hanna"" is an exciting film, no doubt about that. It's like the scriptwriter took the great Japanese revenge film, ""Lady Snowblood"", and added to it plots from the old ""Star Trek"" episode ""The Space Seed"" (with Ricardo Montalban as 'Khan') as well as ""La Femme Nikita""! Because so many story elements in this are familiar (I would also include the evil federal agent character to this), the film, though very exciting, cannot achieve greatness. Excellence, perhaps, but not greatness.When the film begins, Hanna is a teen living with her incredibly demanding and strange father. They live in the wild in Lapland and she seems to constantly be in training from him--mostly survival skills. Then, he tells her that when she's ready for whatever it is she's in training for that she should flip a switch on some box. She does and suddenly American government agents come crawling out of everywhere. Dad is gone--but Hanna awaits them. She is taken to some odd underground facility in Morocco and soon she escapes--and kills quite a few agents in order to escape. Throughout the rest of the film, a deranged agent (Kate Blanchett--who was poorly cast and whose accent was just wrong) and her evil minions travel all over Africa and Europe looking to kill Hanna and her dad. Why do they want to do this and what's all this about? Well, see the film.This is an interesting movie because although there are lots of gritty action scenes and violence, at the same time, Hanna is a teen who has seen almost nothing of the world. She just wants to survive to experience it all and watching her see things for the first time was the best part of the film for me. Saoirse Ronan did a great job in the lead--especially since, according to IMDb, he mostly did her own stunts. Well worth seeing, though I am getting tired of the evil federal agent angle--it is getting to be a bit of a cliché because it's been used so much.",Hanna
1,TheLittleSongbird,One of my favourites of the year...,10,4 September 2011,"I have seen a lot of movies from this year, some amazing, some good, some decent, some bad and some truly awful. Hanna for me is one of my favourites of the year and fits in the amazing category. The story is always thrilling and further elevated by slick pacing and expertly choreographed and edited action sequences. Hanna is very well made too, there may be the odd occasion where it might feel overdone, but overall I found the cinematography, direction and editing sleek and efficient. The script is sharp and clever and helps to keep the characters well-defined. Speaking of the characters, I was pleasantly surprised at how exceptionally well-written the titular character was, hard edged yet with a sympathetic side, I loved that. The acting is truly excellent. Cate Blanchett and Eric Bana's characters aren't quite as well written as Saoirse Ronan's but both actors do a splendid job in their roles. Best of all is Ronan who is simply brilliant. All in all, amazing and one of my favourites of 2011 so far. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Hanna
2,Leofwine_draca,A Wright cock-up,3,15 December 2013,"I've seen a couple of Joe Wright's past films as director, PRIDE & PREJUDICE and ATONEMENT, and I liked both of them; particularly the latter, which told a traditional wartime romance story in a fresh and invigorating way. Therefore I looked forward to seeing what Wright would do with an equally traditional assassin-based action/thriller, his first foray into the genre.Unfortunately, this is a Wright cock-up and the director makes a real pig's ear of the material. HANNA is a glacial and uninteresting story about a young teenage girl, who's a top killer assassin for no good reason, and like Steven Soderbergh's HAYWIRE it fails to connect with any of the characters in any way, leaving them a one-dimensional tableau for the viewer to watch but never interact with.Where to go with what's wrong here? Saoirse Ronan, for a start, who is singularly unconvincing as a supposed top assassin; I didn't buy it for a second, and no amount of camera trickery will make me believe otherwise. It doesn't help that there's no real story to speak of, just characters moving from one place to the next in search of substance. The movie is also saddled with the terrible Cate Blanchett, as awkward here as the villain as she was in INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL.Story doesn't matter so much in action films, so long as the action delivers. Needless to say that it doesn't here. Wright is forced to edit around his youthful star to disguise her inability in a manner familiar from many recent Steven Seagal movies. Lapses in logic and some frankly ridiculous interludes don't help either. Eric Bana, playing Ronan's father, is nothing more than boring, as though he's lost the spark he once had in the likes of CHOPPER and TROY. The much-lauded one-take scene is disappointing when put against that of ATONEMENT. Sad to say but this is the type of film I try to put out of my mind as quickly as possible once I've seen it because it really is that bad.",Hanna
3,SnoopyStyle,Saoirse Ronan is a star,7,22 March 2015,Hanna Heller (Saoirse Ronan) is raised in the wilderness from a young age to be an assassin by her father Erik Heller (Eric Bana). She tells him that she's ready to face their enemy and activates a beacon to notify Marissa Wiegler (Cate Blanchett). She is a senior secret operative and is after Erik. Marissa imprisons Hanna in a secret CIA base in the desert but she escapes. She is picked up by a British family traveling north Africa in a camper van. She's trying to get to Berlin with Marissa and her hired killers following after her.It's unreal coming-of-age of a killer assassin. Saoirse Ronan's performance is strip down and she's the big star. The detached mannerisms of the characters do test the audience's patient at times. Hanna has some funny moments with the daughter Sophie played by Jessica Barden. The last half of the movie does miss the humanity and humor that Sophie gave to the movie. It's nevertheless a great staring vehicle for Saoirse.,Hanna
4,Prismark10,Fairy tale spies,5,19 June 2017,"Hanna is a modern day fairy tale, The Brothers Grimm meets Jason Bourne with plenty of lapses in logic.Saoirse Ronan is Hanna a teenage girl raised in the wilderness of Finland by her father, an ex-CIA operative Erik Heller (Eric Bana) who since her mother died raised her with the skills of an assassin. Erik realises that Hanna is at an age when she might be ready to see the outside world and the chaos this would bring.Cate Blanchett is a senior CIA agent Marissa Wiegler who wants to track down and kill them both. It seems Hanna was genetically modified in a secret CIA experiment many years earlier giving her exceptional abilities.Erik activated a beacon and leaves, instructing Hanna to meet him in Berlin. A CIA special forces team arrives to capture Hanna who is taken to an underground complex and escapes where Hanna seems to be very adept in surviving in the modern world such as using the internet when before she lived in a remote survivalist environment.Blanchett plays the wicked witch but we have little idea of her motives as to why she even kills innocent people. Once the action stops it becomes a rather derivative euro-plodding thriller. The Chemical Brothers soundtrack just reminds you that it wants to be a junior Jason Bourne.",Hanna
5,claudio_carvalho,Raised to Revenge,7,25 April 2021,"In the wilderness of Finland, the former CIA agent Erik Heller (Eric Bana) raises his teenage daughter Hanna (Saoirse Ronan) to be an assassin since she was a child with the intention of killing the CIA agent Marissa Wiegler (Cate Blanchett). When Hanna is sixteen years old, she feels ready for her assignment and activates a radio beacon in her cabin, exposing her position to Marissa, in the beginning of her adventure to confront the dangerous Marissa and learn a secret about her origins.""Hanna"" is a great action movie with excellent performances. The duel between Hanna and Marissa is engaging and the hidden secret is a plus in the story. Unfortunately the marketing of this film was weak and many people do not know it. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Hanna""",Hanna
6,kosmasp,Who is Hanna?,5,26 December 2011,"Which is the German title of the movie. Which is kinda funny, considering that the movie has a very cliché picture of German baddies in it. Which is one of the reasons I rated it that ""low"". The movie itself may have good leading actors (Bana though not as often on screen as I wish he would be, Blanchett in a different role and the girl lead, who is phenomenal indeed!) and a good soundtrack, but it lacks a few other pointers. One other being the mid-piece.It seems aimless there for awhile. It doesn't really slow down, but you have a period where you can't pinpoint where this is heading. Some may see this as a good thing, of course. So while I liked the action and the cinematography, I would have hoped that the cliché level would have been lowered down a little (amongst other things).",Hanna
7,classicsoncall,"""Kids grow up.""",7,6 March 2020,"You know you have a film with a credibility problem when the title character, in this case Hanna, who's raised in the wild with no creature comforts, is freaked out by a TV, and never heard music before. But then, when it's convenient for the story line, is able to go on a computer and look up what DNA is all about. That's just an example of lazy writing that takes no account of the character's background that was just laid out, but needs an out for the protagonist to pursue her mission. So that brought the picture down a notch for me, which otherwise was a compelling story of a 'super agent' born and bred for a top secret military project. I did like Saoirse Ronan in the title role, she had a vulnerable quality that went with the toughness required for the role of a trained assassin. A couple anomalies in the story, like how did Hanna know the fake Marissa Wiegler wasn't the real deal? And the guy Isaacs (Tom Hollander) on the pursuit mission had an opportunity to close the deal more than once but let those chances go to waste. The real head scratcher for me though was when the top gun assassin hired by the real Marissa Weigler (Cate Blanchett) pursued Hanna until she ditched him by jumping in the bay. Up till that point his nice white jumpsuit was immaculate, but in the very next scene with no action in between, it was a bloody mess!",Hanna
8,lee_eisenberg,"there are times when you have no choice but to fight, even in a fairy tale setting",10,15 February 2018,"Joe Wright's ""Hanna"" has to be one of the most surprising - and impressive - movies that I've seen. The action, and the title character's toughness make this one movie that you have to see. I understand that the movie incorporates fairy tale themes - the girl shielded from the world's harshness suddenly has to face it head-on - but it's possible to ignore that and simply admire how Hanna doesn't fear anyone (electrical objects, on the other hand...). I also liked how they play with the audience: at first it looks as if it's a story of a girl and her father living off the grid, but then the real story begins and doesn't let up.Having seen it all these years after it got released, it's interesting that some of the people involved in it are now notable from recent movies. Joe Wright directed ""Darkest Hour"", Saoirse Ronan starred in ""Lady Bird"" and Vicky Krieps starred in ""Phantom Thread"". But you can ignore that and enjoy the high-paced action (and pay attention to the social commentary).Good one.",Hanna
9,jboothmillard,Hanna,7,4 October 2011,"When I saw this advertised at the cinema I expected it was going to be one of those hit and miss films, rated at least two stars out of five, but then I saw it was rated four, so I decided to try it, from director Joe Wright (Atonement). Basically sixteen year old Hanna Heller (Atonement and The Lovely Bones star Saoirse Ronan) who has unique strength, stamina and intelligence like a trained soldier, and has been raised by her ex-CIA agent father Erik (Eric Bana) in the woods of Finland since she was a child. Living a teenage life in the wild and with constant training to become the perfect assassin, she is unaware of the outside modern world, and then she ends up captured by a CIA team. Marissa Wiegler (Cate Blanchett) is the CIA officer who wants to be sure Hanna cannot escape while they are looking for and trying to kill her father, but after killing a body double (Michelle Dockery) she does manage to escape. Now on the run in Morocco, she meets travellers Sebastian (Jason Flemyng) and Rachel (The Ghost's Olivia Williams), and she befriends their teenage daughter Sophie (Jessica Barden), they help her to get to Berlin. But Wiegler knows Hanna will be heading there looking for Erik, so she hires night club owner Isaacs (Tom Hollander) to pick up the trail to capture the young assassin, who meanwhile is getting to know her modern surroundings. Eventually, after some encounters alongside the family she has joined, her father finds her and reveals that Wiegler has murdered her grandmother. He also reveals he is not Hanna's biological father but a former CIA agent in charge of an experiment that extracted aborted baby genes to create newborn children with enhanced DNA and create super soldiers, it was abandoned and she was the last of the eliminated children. He tells that Wiegler murdered her birth mother Johanna Zadek (Vicky Krieps) as well, and after letting Hanna escape Erik acts as a distraction against those hunting her, he ends up shot and killed by Wiegler. In the end after chasing Hanna through an abandoned theme park and asking for an end to the killing, Wiegler shoots her, but trying to get away falls and Hanna grabs her gun to fulfil her mission, which was of course to kill Wiegler, which she does. Also starring John MacMillan as Lewis, Tim Beckmann as Walt and Jamie Beamish as Burton. Young Ronan gives a good edgy performance as the outcast assassin with the high intelligence, Bana is suitable as her knowledgeable tutor, and Blanchett almost steals the show with her brilliantly ice and aggressively determined character, I will admit there were the tiniest moments where I fazed out of what was going on, but overall it is a film with good intense chases and interesting twists and turns, a most watchable mystery action thriller. Very good!",Hanna
10,rmax304823,Supergirl.,6,3 March 2012,"The CIA conducted an experiment sixteen years ago in which through cloning, genetic tickling, and assorted microbiochemical mishigas, a dozen babies are produced that have enhanced powers of strength and memory. The CIA decides to call it off and they liquidate the participants in the experiment except for one blond girl. Agent Eric Bana runs off with her, takes her to a Neolithic hut he's built in the North Woods, and trains her to be an assassin like himself. Now, after those sixteen years have passed, the CIA finally locates Bana's primitive hut and they're after him and the super baby, who has turned into Saoirse Ronan.I know. Some of what I've laid out so far is unbelievable, beginning with the idea that Mom and Dad would give their baby girl a name like Saoirse. That's the kind of name they'd use on Alpha Centauri or somewhere. Not that I have anything against exotic names. In the gay and lesbian chat room I'm known as Sabre LaFevre. On the other hand, sixteen or not, she's supernally beautiful, with flaxen hair and straw-colored eyebrows and eyelashes, and her eyes are arctic blue. On top of that, she runs like an antelope and can deck three or four muscle-bound warriors, with kicks and chops, better than my ex wife.My TV Guide, with which I sometimes agree, gives this three stars out of four, but that suggests that it's better than it is. The plot itself is not much more than one long chase. The CIA, led by Cate Blanchett and assisted by a handful of sadistic goons recruited from a German night club that features a hermaphrodite as a stage act, are after Bana and Ronan in a serious way. The two prey have been separated but they are to meet in the Grimm Fairy Tale House in Berlin, evidently a tourist attraction, run by an old friend of Bana's.Well, Bana is tough to find and tougher to capture. He's a trained hit man, after all. But he hasn't been physically engineered like Ronan. She can do impossible things. She can leap tall buildings in a single bound. If I were Blanchett, I suppose I'd try to knock off Bana -- even though he constitutes no threat to anyone -- but I'd give up on Ronan.I think maybe the TV Guide's three stars were awarded because the reviewers categorize the films into genres before ranking them. That is, they separate movies into ""Westerns,"" ""noirs,"" ""comedies,"" ""family movies,"" etc., then compare the movies within each category before awarding stars. This is an ""action thriller"" and I guess by the standards of the genre it's above average. The acting is effective, though little is called for. The musical score suits itself to the scene and, when it's not zapping us with percussion, can be rather neat. An exhilarating if unnecessary flamenco number appears half way through. The visit to the Grimm House with its colored lamps, gingerbread cottage, and over-sized mushrooms evokes Alice in Wonderland, and the pleasant, slightly mystical tune under the end credits is easy on the ears.I didn't care much for Cate Blanchett is the stereotyped role of the dedicated and ruthless bureaucratic murderer. She's far too good an actress for that. By dint of a lot of garish make up and by turning her hair a staggering auburn and shaping it into some kind of organic crash helmet, they've managed to make her look made of steel, which is not integral to her nature.There's nothing special about the direction. Sometimes it's irritating. It sometimes wobbles, but less than in many other action thrillers, which probably contributed to its three star rating. There are enormous close ups of the faces of two young girls in bed, and a kiss takes place, suggesting something that, lamentably, never follows. More than once, Joe Wright twirls the camera around on its axis during a chase scene, so that Ronan appears to be running on the ceiling. The first film that turned a camera upside down was in the early sixties, when a man is being chased by a tank, in ""Ballad of a Soldier."" It was shocking and effective. Here it's a tired device. And some of the fight scenes are in slow motion. Brothers and sisters, let us pray that the forty-year fad for slow-motion acting has about petered out.But fans of action movies should love this flick. And I'd much rather watch a pretty young blond girl running around than the usual bald Boulder Dam with legs.",Hanna
11,Tweekums,Surprisingly bleak action thriller,9,11 February 2012,"This film opens with a teenaged girl named Hanna hunting and killing a deer on a frozen, northern forest; as she guts the carcass she is jumped by a man who turns out to be her father, Erik; he has been training her for the day when she will have to survive in the big bad world. He isn't insane; there are people who want them dead. These people are lead by Marissa Wiegler, a member of the CIA who worked with Erik many years before and wants to eliminate them both because of the secrets the hold. When Hanna decides that she is ready a signal is sent telling Marissa where they are. Erik leaves telling her they will meet again in Berlin she waits and is captured and taken to a holding facility; she isn't there long though as she escapes; killed several guards in the process. Once outside she finds herself in the Moroccan desert. She manages to hide in a camper van belonging to an English family and goes with them to Europe. She befriends them but has to run again when she realises they are being followed and are in danger. Alone again she heads for Berlin where she will confront Marissa and learn the shocking truth about herself.I really enjoyed this film despite, or perhaps because, it wasn't what I was expecting. The blurb described Hanna as 'a girl brought up to be the perfect assassin'; this isn't really true though; however she has been trained to do what it takes to survive. She frequently deals with threats but doesn't actively seek targets to kill. The action sequences are exciting and well choreographed but don't expect them to be stylishly cool like in some action films Hanna most definitely isn't like Hit Girl from 'Kick-Ass'! Saoirse Ronan does a great job as the eponymous Hanna; her fair hair and intense blue eyes giving her an ethereal quality that fitted perfectly in her frozen home. Cate Blanchett and Eric Bana also do well as Marissa and Erik. I was also a bit surprised at some of the violence given the film's 12 certificate; I suspect it must have been near the top end of that certificate and most parents wouldn't want children much younger than that seeing it; not that I think it would appeal to younger viewers as there is little light relief and the ending isn't exactly happy.",Hanna

13,michaelRokeefe,A teen assassin is ready for the world.,8,2 October 2011,"This movie is as simplistic as it could become complicated. Eric Bana plays an ex-CIA operative that has secluded himself in Finland, where he has trained his now teen-aged daughter Hanna(Saoirse Ronan)in the arts of survival and killing. Not allowed to be a typical teenager, Hanna has spent her young life honing the important and dangerous skills passed down by her father. She has finally reached the time to put her abilities to the test and sets out on a trek across Europe, where she shows up on the radar of an intelligence operative Marissa(Cate Blanchett), who has waited for years for her anticipated arrival. The world just doesn't know the full extent of Hanna's skills let alone the identity of her suspected target. When Marissa closes in on Hanna, secrets from the past are discovered to cause questions about the young assassin's very existence. The scenery is fantastic and the acting of Bana and Blanchett couldn't be better. As for the talented Miss Ronan, it is obvious she is a friend of the camera. Also in the cast of this thriller: Oliva Williams, Tom Hollander, Jason Flemyng, Jessica Barden and Paris Arrowsmith.",Hanna
14,hitchcockthelegend,Hanna-Barbera More Like.,4,21 April 2013,"Hanna is directed by Joe Wright and written by David Farr and Seth Lochhead. It stars Saoirse Ronan, Eric Banna, Tom Hollander, Olivia Williams, Jason Flemyng and Cate Blanchett. Music is by The Chemical Brothers and cinematography by Alwin H. Kuchler.Hanna Heller (Ronan) is a 16 year old highly trained assassin on the run from the CIA...Heralded by some British critics as original and thrilling, Joe Wright's Hanna is neither. It's a gimmick movie dressed up as cool for the kids fodder that is both boring and cheesy. Taking the gimmick aside, that of a 16 year old crack assassin girl slotting all who come in her way, it starts off promisingly enough as we meet Hanna and her father Erik (Banna) out in the wilderness. There's training, a believable bond (both Ronan and Banna don't disgrace themselves) and the wintry landscape bites hard as we wonder what is in store.Then the film shifts to Hanna being on the run, where the back story guff is just, well, guff, and the pace crawls to a standstill. Blanchett's (badly miscast) CIA operative is in pursuit, with that back story guff tattooed on her forehead, and it tries to gain momentum for the inevitable showdown between the big bad bitch and the little china doll killer. The Chemical Brothers drip their brand of techno beats over it, which is OK if you like that sort of thing. How cool?!In the middle passages Hanna rides along with a Hippy family, with Flemyng also badly miscast, and there's some cack-handed attempt at humanising poor Hanna as she comes alive in the big old world. It's derivative in premise, boring in execution and designed to make teenagers think they are watching a masterpiece for their generation.The amusement park finale is well staged, location photography is pleasing enough in that hip-euro way, and Banna and Ronan work hard to keep it from total damnation. But for much of the near two hour run time it's a butt numbing bore that has ideas far above its station. Joe Wright should stick to making Keira Knightley look good. 4/10",Hanna
15,LeonLouisRicci,Disengage the Brain and Enjoy,7,29 June 2012,"A stylish super-soldier action film filled with surreal images and a surprisingly effective over-the-top musical score are what makes this admittedly artificial account so entertaining.Disengage the brain and enjoy the ride. If you don't take it too seriously it can be quite a different take on the modern trend born of the more thoughtful of today's espionage extravaganzas.The three major characters are cool in a comic-book kind of way and the action is an accentuation of set pieces that are refreshing and riveting. There's not much new in the scientific scenario and the less than explanatory script is a deterrent, but, one could argue, that this is nothing more than pulp fiction here to entertain and not an adaptation of literary superstars.Shallow but not to the point of distraction and it more than compensates with the crisp presentation and dreamlike depictions of a nightmarish revelation and a sympathetic situation.",Hanna
16,writers_reign,The Wright Stuff,5,13 May 2011,"This is the new entry from Joe all-I-want-is-a-gong Wright, the guy who shoots every frame with an eye on the Festival circuit. This time around he's given the Academic-Pseud boys plenty to chew on and he must have thought it was a brilliant idea to use in-yer-face violence as a beard for art-house fodder and I wonder how long it took him to come up with a thinly-disguised 'super-race' concept to kick-start the plot; as if Mengele hasn't suffered enough he now has Wright taking his concept of breeding super beings and adding spin plus taking care to throw in some pretty photography to adorn a plot you could drive a truck through (as has been noted by other posters). Add a flavor-of-the-month band and the gongs are practically guaranteed. Personally I wouldn't object in the least if someone gave Wright a Golden Rivet.",Hanna
17,zardoz-13,"""The Wild Child"" Meets ""Kick Ass""",7,19 April 2011,"""Pride & Prejudice"" director Joe Wright's offbeat actioneer ""Hanna"" qualifies as a straightforward but unsavory pursuit saga about an angel-faced teenage lass with unkempt hair who displays no qualms about killing the people who want her kaput. This savage, single-minded, PG-13 epic is the kind of movie where innocent bystanders suffer the consequences when they find themselves caught in the crossfire of its violence. In most movies, the role-model heroes and slimy villains assail only those who interfere with their objectives. Anybody who encounters our pugnacious heroine and her murderous adversaries, however, suffers a horrible death. In other words, when they befriend the heroine, they become targets for the villains. Although ""Hanna"" shares some similarities with last year's father-daughter thriller ""Kick Ass,"" with Nicolas Cage and Chloe Moretz, this Focus Features release is an altogether different kind of white-knuckler. The chief difference between ""Hanna"" and ""Kick Ass"" is that the former confines its violence to the bounds of matter-of-fact realism and manages to be much more harrowing. Saoirse Ronan as the eponymous heroine; Eric Bana as her mentor; and Cate Blanchett as the trigger-happy villainess deliver gripping performances. As Hanna, Saoirse Ronan makes a first-rate heroine. She seems to realize that she has been programmed from the get-go to tangle with Marissa. With her Southern fried drawl, Blanchett excels as a CIA agent who is both charming and lethal. When our heroine demands to meet her, Marissa sends an impostor, and Hanna dispatches the poor impostor without blinking an eye. Imagine what would happen if a 16-year old girl home schooled in all forms of combat were turned loose on the world without any interpersonal social skills? She has never had a friend, aside from the older man who has steeped her in violence. Everything she knows came either from her surrogate father or the book that he read aloud to her. As an individual, Hanna lacks compassion. Later, we learn that she has been genetically enhanced from birth to be stronger and less compassionate. Unlike her well-coiffed counterpart in ""Kick Ass,"" our scraggly-haired heroine neither dons a colorful, close-clinging costume nor wields exotic weapons. Instead, Hanna, her surrogate father, and the sadistic ruffians who pursue them rely strictly on conventional weapons. Hanna's felonious foes regard murder as a reasonable alternative for any predicament.""Hanna"" opens in a stretch of snowy woods. Our heroine is patiently stalking a deer. Literally, she blends in with her surroundings and uses a bow and arrow to bring down the deer. Unfortunately, Hanna misses the animal's heart and resorts to an automatic pistol to finish it off. Suddenly, without warning, a man materializes behind her and informs her that she is dead. This precipitates a violent struggle with both exchanging staggering blows. As it turns out, this is a routine between Hanna (Saoirse Ronan of ""Atonement"") and former espionage agent Erik Heller (Eric Bana of ""Hulk""), and he tries to catch her when the poor girl least suspects it. ""You must always be ready,"" Erik warns her. ""Adapt. Or die!"" These sporadic fights recall the comic brawls between Inspector Clouseau and his Asian manservant Kato in ""The Pink Panther"" franchise. Clouseau has Kato attack him when he least expects it to perfect his defensive skills. Anyway, Erik and Hanna live in isolation in the middle of the woods near the Arctic Circle in complete isolation with none of the usual modern-day appliances. One day Erik informs Hanna that she is free to venture out into the world. He unearths a transponder and puts it in front of Hanna. Erik warns her about tripping the switch. ""She won't stop until you're dead, or she is,"" Erik describes the chief villainess. Nevertheless, Hanna activates the transponder while Erik is away hunting game. Far off at Langley Virginia in CIA headquarters, Marissa Wiegler (Cate Blanchett of ""Elizabeth""), who loves to maintain her dental hygiene to the point of bleeding her gums, sets out to track down Erik. She hires some loathsome killers led by Isaacs (Tom Hollander of ""Valkyrie"") to help her because the CIA refuses to have anything to do with it.What sets ""Hanna"" apart from most thrillers about callous killers is its overwhelming lack of nonsense. This tale of initiation charts her journey from the Arctic Circle, to Morocco, and ultimately to Berlin without any twists. At times, ""Hanna"" may even be too realistic as our heroine dispatches her enemies without a shred of emotion. Wright stages several well-orchestrated examples of close-quarters combat without heightening these encounters with the usual snappy editing so prevalent in most actioneers. You won't be shadow boxing with the on-screen characters as much as cringing at their bloodthirsty shenanigans. Wright and freshman scenarists Seth Lochhead and David Farr make allusions to Grimm's fairy tales throughout the narrative. Indeed, the landscape and the settings resemble something out of a fairy tale, whether it is the cold, icy wastelands of the Arctic Circle or an elaborate children's amusement park in Germany. The house Hanna and Erik hole up in looks like something from Grimm's fairy tales. The finale relies heavily on this Grimm imagery as our villainess strolls out of a tunnel shaped like the mouth of a giant big bad wolf. Mind you, ""Hanna"" isn't in the same league with either ""The Terminator"" or ""No Country for Old Men,"" but it is still pretty exciting. Ultimately, this humorless melodrama lacks sympathetic characters and generates little in the way of charisma. After everything is said and everybody is dead, you'll feel gratified but unsure about our protagonist's future. Wright and company leave things open in ""Hanna"" for a sequel, but it is one that you can wait on without any sense of anticipation.",Hanna
18,grantss,Good action-thriller,7,5 March 2017,"Good action-thriller. Slow-building, gritty, plot is very intriguing. Too complex though, with many loose ends which never get tied up. A bit more explanation of certain aspects of the plot was called for, as it would have made the story more coherent. However, it was good that certain details weren't spoon-fed to the audience, being slowly bled in. Solid direction. Fight scenes are exciting, without being too plentiful and thus seeming to be the only focus of the movie (unlike many martial arts movies).Good performance from Saoirse Ronan in the lead role.

20,neil-476,Ronan is terrific,8,12 May 2011,"Teenager Hanna is attacked by her father while she is butchering a reindeer in a snowy wilderness. Turns out that he does this all the time: it is part of preparing her for life away from the remote cabin where she has spent most of her life. All too soon she finds herself pursued by murderous stooges working for an unhinged government operative, taking temporary refuge and finding a temporary normal life with an English family on holiday, and calling on those skills to survive.This is a good thriller, with a fabulous central performance from Saoirse Ronan.It is not perfect. Cate Blanchett's villainous operative is a bit too panto, with emotional issues hinted at (what was that business with the teeth?) but never explored. There are places where the pace flags a bit. We never find out what happens to the English family (and we needed to). The film's most shockingly effective moment is fully given away in the trailer. There are some illogicalities and unanswered questions. And the revelation of Hanna's secret is almost certainly more of a surprise to her than it is to us.But this is mostly a very enjoyable movie, with great (and unusual locations), good direction, well executed action sequences (a bit too much Bourne wobble), an emotional heart, a good ending, and some well-placed and very welcome humour.And best of all, two things: Ronan's performance, and a very effective and unusual score from the Chemical Brothers.I enjoyed this film.",Hanna
21,ferguson-6,I Just Missed Your Heart,8,9 April 2011,"Greetings again from the darkness. I am struggling a bit with how much to say about this one. It is such a different type of film that it's difficult to categorize. Yes, it is definitely an Action-Thriller (in the Bourne vein), but it also has some dark comedy, as well as some commentary on parenting, governmental agencies and coming of age.Let me first say that I highly recommend the film if you are an fan of thrillers and/or action films. It succeeds well on both fronts. However, there is much more to this movie, particularly the fantastic talents of Saoirse Ronan. You will remember her stunning turns in both ""Atonement"" and ""The Lovely Bones"". Here she plays Hanna, a girl raised in the deep forest by her father (Eric Bana). His sole purpose in raising her was to train her to be a deadly weapon in any situation. Oh and he also ""schooled"" her with some generic encyclopedia that evidently was a gas station giveaway. Her head is filled with facts, figures and data on all parts of the world, and somehow she speaks an infinite number of languages.When she finally tires of gutting deer in the wild, she tells her father she is ""ready"". We then find out that her father is some type of former CIA agent and with the flip of a sonar switch, the two separate and the CIA moves in to capture her. While sitting in a secured bunker in the desert, her ""mission"" becomes clear. She is to kill the CIA agent played by Cate Blanchett. That's when the movie kicks into gear.What follows are some terrific action and fight sequences, a wonderful segment where Hanna hangs out with a traveling British family led by Olivia Williams and Jason Flemyng ... and their daughter Sophie, played exceptionally well by Jessica Barden. The ""friendship"" that Sophie and Hanna create really brings into focus how sheltered from society Hanna has been.The cat and mouse chase with Blanchett and her goons would have worked better if Blanchett's character had been better defined and she wasn't just god-awful in it. Usually Ms. Blanchett is a strong actress who adds much to a film. Here, she is the dead-weight keeping it from reaching even greater heights.The film is directed by Joe Wright, who has also provided ""Pride and Prejudice"", ""Atonement"", and ""The Soloist"". The man knows how to make a movie ... and that's why this is so much more than an action flick. I must also mention that the Chemical Brothers are standouts with the film score, and though it catches you off guard at first, it really adds impact and effect to the film. There have been a few recent films with young girls in action/fight films. And while Chloe Moretz was excellent in ""Kick-Ass"", this film is far superior. Get to know Saoirse (pronounced Sur-Shuh) Ronan. She is a real talent!",Hanna
22,FlashCallahan,I just missed your heart....,4,3 September 2011,"Hanna is a teenage girl. Uniquely, she has the strength, the stamina, and the smarts of a soldier.These come from being raised by her father, an ex-CIA man, in the wilds.Living a life unlike any other teenager, her upbringing and training have been one and the same, all geared to making her the perfect assassin.The turning point in her adolescence is a sharp one.Sent into the world by her father on a mission, she journeys stealthily across Europe while eluding agents dispatched after her by a ruthless intelligence operative with secrets of her own.As she nears her ultimate target, Hanna faces questions and revelations about her existence and about her humanity....Well the film looks and sounds beautiful, and the three leads are good with the material, but the film is just too long and very, very, boring.A lot of people are mistaking this for art-house, but would Hollander as a camp German killer from a Men Without Hats video really be in it? It's these sort of bad character choices and predictability and flaws that make this so difficult to watch.There are some beautifully shot scenes (the subway fight, the opening), but these lead to nowhere and seem to be just there for spectacle.The mixture of awkward humour provided when Hanna goes on a road trip just feels out of place, and adds no real substance to her story or the films narrative.Blanchett is good as the evil government agent, but one feels that she needs a cat to stroke ala Blofeld.So like i've said, it's shot beautifully, and the Chemical Brothers provide an excellent score, but it's such a mundane story, it's hard not to get bored.",Hanna
23,phd_travel,Needed a Luc Besson touch,3,23 July 2013,"What a waste of a good cast. The actors are all good - the kind you want to see more of in successful movies Eric Bana, Cate Blanchett and Saoirse Ronan. Unfortunately the story isn't good - the characters are unappealing especially Cate Blanchett's character who is so annoyingly homicidal and the story leaves an irritating bad feeling. A Luc Besson treatment of the story would have made things more watchable - where you feel for the characters and there is a bit of humor in it. Saoirse Ronan tries hard with the action killing ssequences as this teenage killing machine but they make her look so dreadful with the fried straggly light colored hair. She is actually quite a pretty actress. This movie was a waste of time and badly written. Don't bother.",Hanna
24,Wuchakk,"European adventure/spy thriller about a real, um, super girl",7,5 November 2017,"RELEASED IN 2011 and directed by Joe Wright, ""Hanna"" starts off in the wintery wilderness of northern Finland where an ex-CIA father (Eric Bana) has been training his teen daughter, the titular character (Saoirse Ronan), to survive in a harsh world of cutthroat government agents. When the girl's ready, she's introduced to the real world where she's ruthlessly hunted down from North Africa to Germany by a mysterious intelligence operative, Marissa (Cate Blanchett), and her heavies.What I like best about this movie is its uniqueness, stylishness and picturesque globetrotting. This is top-of-the-line filmmaking with a hip, kinetic, quirky tone and superlative score, comparable to ""Lucy"" (2014) and Tarantino thrillers like ""Kill Bill"" (2003/2004). It's not a great film because there's not enough depth or mindfood, but it contains a few elements of greatness and is overall entertaining enough.We learn Marissa is preoccupied with Hanna for unknown reasons; so, while she's an expert agent, this obsession is her kryptonite. Subtext-wise, the movie's an obvious metaphor for a child reaching adulthood and the agonies of being a loving parent (preparing them for the world, teaching them necessary skills to survive, giving them increasing freedom, being candid about the callousness of life). It's also somewhat of a fairytale about the relationship between a father and daughter. Later in the film Marissa asks Erik, ""Why now?"" and he simply replies, ""Kids grow up."" I liked the dichotomy of the so-called normal banality of the civilians compared to the single-minded cold-bloodedness of the agents. If you object to the sometimes unwieldy fight scenes, go parent a child, wait eighteen years, then view it again and see if you feel the same. The film's often thrilling, but don't approach this as a straight action flick or you'll probably be disappointed.There are low-key things that are clumsily explored, like the RV family perking Hanna's curiosity about life (remember she grew up isolated in the northern wilds), but this was an obvious mechanism to make us feel bad that she was on this life-or-death mission, and different than these ""normal"" kids, yet at the same time special and more exciting, which is how the daughter & kid brother viewed Hanna. The individual used as a tool is hardly innovative, but I nonetheless appreciated this take on it.THE FILM RUNS 111 minutes and was shot in Finland, Morocco and (mostly) Germany.

The movie blends well with the video game aspect where the little girl warrior fights a military installation, assassins, and deals with a weird environment. Why did the dad figure let her go on her own into the world after raising her in the woods all those years? Eric Bana plays a different role but still action oriented. Cate Blanchette plays a very anal character. One can see this of the character through the way she brushes her teeth. A little OCD here. Okay movie. I liked it more than my wife.

27,Hellmant,Joe Wright proves himself a directing force to be reckoned with!,8,14 April 2011,"'HANNA': Four Stars (Out of Five) Stylized revenge thriller, this one focusing on a 16 year old girl (with amazing strength and deadly skills) trained to be an assassin since birth. It's directed by Joe Wright, who's directed such critically acclaimed (and oddly different) films as 'ATONEMENT', 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' and 'THE SOLOIST'. The film was written by first time feature film writers Seth Lochhead and David Farr and the script made both the 2006 and 2009 Black List (a list of what Hollywood insiders rate the best unproduced screenplays of the year). It stars Saoirse Ronan, of 'THE LOVELY BONES' and 'ATONEMENT' fame (in which Wright directed her to a supporting actress Oscar nomination), as the 16 year old super assassin and title role. It also stars Cate Blanchett and Eric Bana. Although the film lacks any true originality or a strong amount of character depth it's still uniquely memorable and highly entertaining.Bana plays ex-CIA operative Erik who's been raising his 16 year old daughter (with enhanced abilities and strength) Hanna since birth in the Finland wilderness, far away from society, technology and the rest of the world. He's kept her hidden due to the fact that her termination is highly desired by an old CIA colleague of his named Marissa (Blanchett). Marissa will stop at nothing to see young Hanna dead and has incredible resources to help her do it, including the CIA. Erik has trained Hanna to be the perfect killing machine in order to give her the skills to stop Marissa and free herself once and for all. After much begging and pleading from Hanna to finally complete this mission, and fulfill her desires of seeing the outside world, Erik gives her a transmitter which will allow her location to be picked up by Marissa. After some consideration Hanna activates the transmitter and waits for Marissa to come get her. Chaos ensues.The movie does follow a pretty standard revenge thriller format with not a lot much more to it but there are some small twists and the way it's directed is superb. Wright proves himself a directing force to be reckoned with here and I look forward to seeing future projects by him. I wasn't a fan of all the film's slow-mo fight scenes (which are a little overdone) but for the most part the movie has a very unique and likable feel and mood to it. Enhanced greatly by the score, composed by the band 'The Chemical Brothers'. The characters aren't extremely well developed but there's definitely enough there to get to know them somewhat and feel for them on some level, or at least some of them. Especially Hanna's character and her coping with the common theme of feeling like an outcast and freak. The character rings very true thanks in large part to Wright's directing and Ronan's performance. Her and Blanchett really make this film rock and give two of the best female performances of the year. It's one film I'd definitely recommend seeing.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j95Zjdlcbe0",Hanna
28,cherold,Brilliant concept admirably handled most of the way through,8,8 August 2012,"This unique movie essentially blends elements of spy thrillers with Grimm Bros. fairy tales. This is why those who just review this as an action-spy movie are missing the point. Yes, it is an action-spy movie, but it's also a movie about a girl growing up in isolation facing the shock of experiencing the real world.Her reaction to music, her first startling experience with electricity, are as much a part of this as her fighting bad guys.The film's concept is shown off most brilliantly in the early scenes, and there are wonderful moments throughout. Cate Blanchett is excellent in her spy-nemesis/evil-queen role. For a long time, the movie moves along pretty flawlessly.Unfortunately, towards the end the story loses its bearings. Hanna's actions at the end don't jibe with the early Hanna, and nothing in the movie establishes the sort of personal evolution needed for this to make sense. The movie also becomes unnecessarily grim and rather heartless. And what Hanna learns of her back story is too underdeveloped.While I found the end somewhat disappointing, and became slightly restless during the last half hour, the majority of the movie was so terrific that, overall, I am still a big fan. With a better resolution this could have been a truly brilliant movie, and while it falls slightly short of that, it is still well worth watching.",Hanna
29,richardchatten,Hanna's War,6,11 October 2020,"A hybrid action movie and chick flick that one minute feels like a remake of 'The Virgin Spring' (complete with subtitles) and the next like a new version of 'Nikita', and so on for two hours.It's fun watching Cate Blanchett's American-accented Wicked Witch in high heels and Armani doggedly pursuing Saoirse Ronan's Dorothy; both packing heat and proving themselves perfectly capable of carrying an action flick. If there were more such pictures with female protagonists I'd definitely watch them (although I'll be glad when film directors grow as tired of steadicam as I already have).",Hanna
30,bowmanblue,It was better the first time around,6,9 March 2015,"Sometimes, I'll watch a film and not really like it. Then, over time, for one reason or another I'll start thinking about it and decide to view it again. Quite often, a second viewing can make all the difference and I'll end up liking the film. However, I kind of did the opposite with 'Hanna.' I've just watched it for a second time (having quite enjoyed it the first time round and therefore buying it on DVD) and it's kind of left me a little hollow.Yes, I know it was never meant to be a great Oscar-worthy work of art. I'm quite happy to sit through 'no-brainer' action flicks which are there only to entertain. And, although that does – kind of – apply to Hanna, I thought there was more to it originally.The titular 'Hanna' is a genetically-engineered super-kid who's been spirited away from her CIA creators and raised as 'the perfect assassin' by her – equally skilled – father. Then, one day he decides they should go and kill the people responsible for creating her. You don't really find out why. Maybe because she's just turned 16? So her dad (Eric Bana) just wanders off and agrees to meet her somewhere in Europe. Hanna gets captured (or allows herself to get captured) so that she can escape. Then the film is basically a sixteen-year-old girl killing one wave of CIA hit men after the next.Yes, it's quite nicely shot, but there are times when you really have to suspend your disbelief to get anything out of it. I can buy that – technically – this film is *almost* sci-fi, what with Hanna's 'genetically-engineered' heritage, so you have to accept that she can do things that no real human ever could. However, she's still just a killer in a thin, sixteen year old girl's body, which makes it a little unbelievable sometimes.Plus she's not that easy to root for. She murders everything that moves and displays little emotion because of it (just like every other character in the film!). Yes, there's some character development as she tries to become friends and lead a 'normal' life over her 'destiny,' but she's still a little robotic to truly be 'liked.' On my second viewing, I didn't hate the film. I may well watch it again in a few years time, but I just didn't really feel as forgiving to its flaws as I obviously did the first time around. If you want to totally suspend your disbelief and watch a pretty little 'chase' film set in Europe, you could give this a go. The 'Taken' films aren't as pretty, but even they're more believable!",Hanna
31,ThomasDrufke,Chilling,7,1 December 2018,"A fascinating premise, unique execution, and a chilling lead performance from Saoirse Ronan make 'Hanna' a fun watch, even if the pacing comes to a hault in certain moments. This is essentially Joe Wright's version of a western, just with a modern twist, and snow of course. Hanna revolves around a young girl trained to be an assassin from an early age and that's pretty much all she knows from childhood. When the government finds her whereabouts, she's forced to flee and discover her haunting past that could change her outlook on life forever. That's the most prototypical way to describe this film, but it's effective. And for the most part, Hanna works.7.7/10",Hanna
32,MLDinTN,teenage girl is super soldier...,5,4 March 2012,"is the basic idea of this movie. I thought it was OK, but parts were too unbelievable to be taken seriously. At the beginning, we see Hanna and her dad living in a cabin in a remote forest. She is a petite teenager and dragging around a couple hundred pound deer. That's impossible. Later the story tells us she's some kind of genetic experiment and designed to be a super soldier and that's supposed to explain how she's as strong as a top notch weight lifter. I didn't buy it.Also how did she go from Morrocco to Europe. She was traveling with a family, but they never got on a plane. The story just had too many loop holes.FINAL VERDICT: There are better assassin movies out there, I don't think it's good enough to recommend.",Hanna
33,g-bodyl,Well-Made Action Film!,8,4 February 2013,"Hanna is not your normal action film. The director, Joe Wright used some creativity to make something new in the otherwise stale action genre. Of course, this has your punches and kicks and your high casualty rate, but this is unique because of a few reasons. The main reason is the protagonist is a young female and also this film has a rather art-house feel to it.This film is about a girl who has been raised to be an assassin. When she in sent out on her first mission, she becomes tracked by a lady who knows a very dark secret and will do her best to capture Hanna and her father.Saoirse Ronan is a talented young actress. She really did her own stunts and that impressed me. If she battled Hit-Girl from Kick Ass, she may actually win. Cate Blanchett is just lovely as the steely FBI agent. I also like the English girl Hanna hung out with just because she is hilariously annoying.Overall, this is a cool action thriller that is finally different compared with other action films. I liked the beginning scene when Hanna has her outcome with a deer. I think that fits the tone of the movie. This is not the best action movie ever, in fact, some people may dislike this because it's so different. I also liked the killer, techno soundtrack for the film. I rate this film 8/10.",Hanna
34,cricketbat,Too stylized for its own good,6,26 July 2018,"Hanna is, ultimately, too stylized for its own good. Some of the artistic choices are fun and interesting, but most of the time it is just distracting.

35,secondtake,"Action and more action, with little underlying plot and some barebones acting",5,4 December 2011,"Hanna (2011)Trying very hard to be original and edgy, and often succeeding. The slightly superhuman Hannah has been trained to be a cold-hearted soldier from birth, and when she becomes an adult (as the movie begins) she is told that there are people in the world who want her dead.That's the core to the movie--both the premise and the problem. What follows is a series of encounters with various ""bad"" people who simply want to find her, and her trainer/father figure, and kill them. That's all. That's a lot in terms of running, shooting, dodging bullets, doing flips and karate chops, running some more, and shooting some more. It's pretty exciting on that level, filmed with the kinetics we've come to expect from films in the last thirty years.In a very large way this is patterned after the ""Bourne"" movies, and instead of super-man Jason Bourne we have super-woman (very young woman) Hanna. The Bourne movies are superior in every way, both with a sense of urgency, with plain old acting, and with the filming, both camera-work and editing. Running second best to those very well made movies is still worth noticing, however, and if you like this kind of modern, heart-zipping, survive as the individual against the evil CIA agents, then this might make your night.Lead actress Saoirse Ronan does her best to be both cold (emotionless by genetic design) and vulnerable (she's a cute blonde girl that plays the innocent cliché too easily, frankly). She was better cast in the moody lush ""Atonement"" in 2007, and here she is facing the problem many actors can't overcome, of being 16 or 17 and no longer a true kid. With the right director (Peter Weir did well last year in ""The Way Back"") she will be an effective young actress.I wish the rest of the cast was even enough to dwell on--there is a family of traveling pseudo-hippie types in their van, well heeled and filled with playful joy and irony (the daughter here, about Hanna's age, is wonderfully insouciant). There is the father-figure, a kind of slimmed down Liam Neeson, good, without depth. And then there is the surprise of it all, the reason I watched the film in the first place, Cate Blanchett. As a high level CIA operative now in the halls of Langley, her character is so limited by typecasting even this most brilliant of actresses couldn't make her role valid or interesting. The final (inevitable) showdown between the two women is almost derailed by the terrific set, which was so obviously some scouting agent's coup--a run down amusement park with lots of fun places to run, hide, and fight in. I saw this with someone who really liked it a lot. I wish I did, too. Huge potential dribbled away into clichés and shallow filmmaking formulas. Even the music, which some have commented on liking, is overbearing. Check it out. Shot in Germany.",Hanna
36,A_Different_Drummer,the review that writes itself,6,7 September 2015,"By an odd coincidence in the same year this film was released another film of a similar type came out, Columbiana.Both at their core are stories of young women in a life they do not want doing things to people they do like. Neither is an Oscar winner, nor even near Oscar territory.Hana has an astonishing cast. Ronan found an chance to let audiences around the world learn she can hold the camera with those amazing eyes of hers. Bana never gave a bad performance in his life. Blanchett however treated us to the worst American ""accent"" in the history of film and a character overall that had no credibility. Not her fault. It was written that way.But I digress.The point is that if you are going to try to do one of these films, than don't outthink the audience or yourself. Just do it. Columbiana with a lesser known cast (and less of a following) is the far superior film.HANNA gets an A for effort, but seriously at some level in Hollywood the people paying the bills should insist on reading the script before they start writing checks.",Hanna
37,tabuno,A Strong Art House Action Thriller with Techo Weaknesses,8,18 January 2019,"10 April 2011. Jason Bourne, Hanna isn't. But Saoirse Ronan follows up her amazing performance in THE LOVELY BONES (2009) with another strong character performance in a surprisingly difficult genre to do so. The greatest weakness in this movie is that careful attention to character development isn't balanced with as fine tuned technical action thriller performance like THE BOURNE IDENTITY (2002) or even ENEMY OF THE STATE (1998). The German Techno music, however, was lusciously vibrant in its supporting role of helping the action along, much like RUN LOLA RUN (1998) and even some suggestive mood music even from such movies as NOMADS (1986) or the hard to find WAVELENGTH (1983). The greatest problem with the movie were the trailers that almost exclusively led audience members to believe that this movie was to be a non-stop action adventure. Instead it turned out to be a much more substantive and creative look at the cultural adaptation of a young person into a strange and modernized world of sights and sounds and Saoirse Ronan and the script capture a compelling visceral experience rarely seen in this action genre. Unfortunately, the lapses in the crisp espionage motif by both Ronan and Bana are disappointing, such as leaving one of the ""bad"" guys alive and being much less aware of the ""bad"" guys as would have been assumed particularly as to who the movie opened and the unnecessary special camera effect of rotating the camera when it would have been much more consistent to have a hyper-detailed focused camera effect as would be expected from an expert killer. Overall, however, the script, the fusion of primitive and modernized, between use of language in isolation and in social situations is amazing, surprisingly, and delightfully delicious. Oddly enough the plot isn't all that innovative by today standards and the ending isn't all that special. Nevertheless, is was a nicely crafted and unusually brilliant movie.",Hanna

39,The-Sarkologist,"A trained killer at 14, Hanna is left to fend for herself.",9,14 October 2011,"This movie was simply brilliant. I've noticed that a lot of comments on IMDb were pretty damning on this movie, and granted I watched it while I was flying over India in the middle of the longest night of my life on my way from Singapore to London. Still, I wasn't really all that drowsy and was quite able to follow this movie, so I really don't understand what people didn't like about it. I guess I'm just different.I like movies about assassins though a lot that I have watched have ended up really disappointing me. That is usually because I go into the film with high expectations and in the end these expectations are simply not met. This was not the case with this film, mainly because I had not heard of it until I was sitting on the plane mulling over whether I should watch something or simply continue reading my book. In then end I am really glad that I ended up watching this film.The movie is about a girl named Hanna who grew up with her father in the European Wilderness (most likely Northern Germany or Poland, it is not really all that clear). Her father Erik (Eric Banna) is teaching her survival and combat skills though it is not clear why, but then Hanna says that she wants to leave as she believes that it is time, so he dumps her in the middle of Morocco and is left to fend for herself and make her way to Germany by a set time.As is typical with a lot of these movies, there is a mysterious organisation that is hunting them down, and it is only Hanna and Erik that stand between them and the realisation of their plans. However the movie focuses mostly on Hanna since after she is dropped in Morocco Erik fades into the background and Hanna joins up with an American family on a holiday through Europe and Morocco (some criticised Morocco as looking to much like Southern California, but who really cares, as long as it is a good movie I don't care where it is filmed, and anyway, the climates are quite similar. Nobody criticised Lord of the Rings for being filmed in New Zealand as opposed to Middle Earth, but then that is not really the same).Yes, this is another coming of age film, and also of a relatively weak person up against incredible odds. I say relatively weak though because Hanna is a trained killer, and she will kill without a second thought. Hanna isn't a Jim Hawkins (of Treasure Island) type of child, no, she is not innocent and she is not weak. Well, she has grown up in a relatively sheltered world, but this is not the sheltered world of middle class Christian suburbia, but rather the rugged and cold outback on Europe. What she is not used to is social interaction in white middle class Christian suburbia namely because the only other person that she knew was her father, and her father trained her to kill, and to kill effectively.",Hanna
40,UniqueParticle,A pure gem,9,12 June 2020,"I'm appalled this got hate at all Hanna is so awesome! Before Saisore Ronan was super known she was in this badass action aficionado, well filmed and slick soundtrack. Almost feels like a Luc Besson action flick with different style. So much captivating fun throughout, it's such a pleasant surprise for the ones that would appreciate it because it's quite a treat to me! I disagree with the few flaws I think there're voided out by the last half.",Hanna
41,briancham1994,Enjoyable but unconvincing,6,4 June 2020,"Hanna is a good action film with an interesting premise. It was fresh for that reason. However, the story was not so interesting and the heroine seemed implausibly perfect. It is supposed to be a ""modern"" fairytale but I didn't see this aspect at all.",Hanna
42,tomgillespie2002,An appealing oddity,6,7 October 2011,"11 year-old Hanna (Saoirse Ronan) lives in the wilderness with her father Erik (Eric Bana). He teaches her to hunt, fight, and basically fend for herself. As Hanna grows restless in isolation, she puts in motion a plan that the two have seemingly been planning for years. She pushes a button, alerting CIA agent Marissa (Cate Blanchett) to their whereabouts. While Erik leaves, Hanna waits and is captured. After being questioned, Hanna kills who she believes to be Marissa and escapes her prison. She finds herself in Saudi Arabia where she befriends a hippy- ish English family, where is pursued by Marissa and her hired goons.If the story of a young, jail-bait assassin kicking the arse of anyone in her path sounds familiar, it would be easy to make comparisons to Chloe Moretz's Hit-Girl in Kick-Ass. But this is a very different animal. Where Kick-Ass was cartoonish and over-the-top in its (very enjoyable) gory action scenes, Hanna takes more of a dramatic route, combined with characteristics of a modern-day fairytale. This approach works both for and against the film, as although its approach is individual and quite refreshing, it is also confused and often slapdash in its execution.I'll start with the good, which there is plenty of. The cast is splendid - Bana and Blanchett are long established solid actors with an impressive backlog of films so they do what is expected of them. Blanchett hams it up with a ridiculous Southern American accent, and she manages to out-sexy her performance in the recent Indiana Jones. Ronan, who so impressed in director Joe Wright's excellent Atonement, strides confidently through another great performance, mixing steely coldness with a wide-eyed innocence as she struggles with this brave new world full of televisions, lights and kettles. And Tom Hollander, a seemingly strange choice for a heavy, is amazingly horrific as a crowbar-wielding, transsexual strip-club owner with a liking for terrible tracksuits.While I was expecting an all-out action film before pressing play, I was pleased with the way the film told Hanna's story. Instead of filling it with action scenes, it takes it's time to show Hanna's discovery of the world, and sweet friendship with Sophie (Jessica Barden). When she joins Sophie's parents Rachel (Olivia Williams) and Sebastian (Jason Flemyng), she discovers boys, dancing, and what she has longed for the most - music. Her father regularly read from an encyclopaedia so she can learn the things of the world, but music cannot be truly described in words, and this is one of the main reasons she initially chooses to leave her sheltered life.Joe Wright, traditionally more at home with period pieces such as Atonement and Pride & Prejudice, struggles with the action scenes. While they are accompanied by a thumping score by The Chemical Brothers, he never really finds a certain style. Sometimes it is fast hand-to-hand to combat filmed on shaky-cam like the Bourne films; sometimes the camera will be swirling all over the place; one time it is filmed in ultra slo- mo like an operatic tragedy. Wright even attempts something similar to his one-shot Dunkirk scene in Atonement, tracking Bana from a train station into the underground where he disposes of a gang of agents. While it may sound good to differ the style, it does unsteady the tone of the film, especially when played against the quieter, more tender moments.Hanna is certainly interesting and I would certainly recommend it to anyone looking for something a bit different from the usual action film, but ultimately it becomes nothing more than an appealing oddity. Ronan is certainly an actress to watch, and Joe Wright will have done no damage to his growing reputation here, and will undoubtedly go from strength to strength.",Hanna
43,johnnyboyz,"Idiotic and just plain stupid at the worst of times, offering a shrill cinematic thrill at the best; the film is far from its director's best work.",5,12 August 2013,"What's most disappointing about Hanna is how it blows a good beginning, a beginning rife with danger, suspense and mystery; a beginning which eventually descends into manic editing; boring causality and sub-""Bourne"" sensibilities. It sort of holds together in a stupid, exploitation-driven kind of a way but is mostly absurd and just plain ordinary. To an extent, Hanna is the sort of film boys the age of fifteen or sixteen hear about; do their best to sneak into, or otherwise see, and then come out of it thinking they've seen something much better than it actually is. Alas, they haven't – they've seen yet another example of the trend symptomatic with the current trend of mainstream cinema; that is to say, films that are essentially B-movies trussed up with A-movie budgets – the relaxed, sub-critical response to the film serves only to prove that mainstream cinema in the English language is mostly dead because this is as good as it gets.Laughably compared to 1994's ""Léon"" upon release, the film actually has more in common with such cinematic landmarks as ""Underworld"" or ""Ultraviolet"" or even ""Catwoman"" – films, of which, at the worst of times are nothing but mere drivel; pieces barely even getting upset about were it for the fact they were propelled by female leads perpetrating a quasi-feminist message to a high-octane aesthetic of rock music and Dutch angles. Evidently, people are bored with adult women going through these motions and now respond quite glowingly to girls doing it – and this is where the trouble starts. A scathing Christopher Tookey review of 2010 film ""Kick-Ass"" saw him berate the film for depicting its heroine as being overtly sexualised, in spite of her infantile age. Distilling an aesthetic from the likes of said examples into a film being led by a female as young as Chloë Moretz was in 2010 (and Saoirse Ronan is here), one can only wonder why a correlation between fetishised action heroine and young girl is being made by respective directors Vaughn and Wright.Depressingly, we live in an age of rampant paedophilia in our Catholic churches; unchallenged and mostly un-tackled city-based Muslim grooming gangs and crooked human-rights laws that allow for murders; rapists and, more relevantly, paedophiles to be victimised in a story that details the punishment for their crime. Some people are actually wholly sympathetic of their cause. As has been written, there was a time when homosexuality was scorned with the similar sort of contempt as paedophilia is now; these days, it is encouraged for somebody to admit to what they truly feel in regards to their orientation and the marriage of two of them together is treated as a reason to rejoice. With the very gradual eroding of everything that made Great Britain what it was for generations past, on top of mass immigration having bringing not only the shameful act of polygamy to these shores but arranged marriages, why should the buck stop with homosexuality?Disturbing issues with the film's approach to its material aside, Hanna's not totally without merit from a filmic angle. There are some decent moments in it, but there is a strict emphasis on ""moments"". Take, for instance, the eponymous Hanna's encounter with another girl of her age and her quite humorous response to being asked a personal question for the very first time. The nightmarish atmosphere of other scenes that director Joe Wright manages to instill into the piece works equally well, visible at its best when one of the nastier, slimier characters of the film frequents a night club to talk to an even nastier and even slimier person who happens to own the place but does some contract killing on the side.The film begins where Saoirse Ronan's character has been living her life all this time, in the snowy isolated woods of Northern Europe where the only other living thing in proximity to her bar the wildlife she lives off is her father Erik (Bana). Erik has taught her how to kill; how to speak foreign languages; how to shoot and basically how to survive. The American government are looking for Erik, who was a spy with them once upon a time. The dirt hits the fan when they're found and Erik is hauled off somewhere while Hanna herself winds up in a high security jail somewhere far removed to what she's used to. The icy Cate Blanchett rears up to play the villain, a C.I.A. agent whose history with Hanna goes back further than first appears, while Tom Hollander chips in to play a supporting bad guy someone like Peter Stormare would've been portraying fifteen years ago.To a degree, this is the film Luc Besson watches and then proceeds to kick himself for not coming up with. It's somewhat sad to say that subtle reveals do eventually give way to chase and all of the things wrong with film-making in general, Hanna's initial position of being raw and untested to the real world around her carries with it an air of anticipation as she treads into the unknown for the very first time, but it quickly dissipates. A chance encounter with a young English girl on holiday with her parents makes for a wonderful contrast between two girls of the same age, of whom have been brought up very differently: that is to say, correctly with proper fathering and an early exposure to some of the finer things in life and through a more materialistic, less cultured method. Later on, a fight scene between one man and a dozen others is so ridiculous that it looks like it belongs in a another film entirely. If you're fond of this sort of stuff, Wright's borrowing from better films you haven't seen will enthral you. If, however, you're looking for a bit more than second unit exercise, you will be disappointed.",Hanna
44,Rectangular_businessman,Much better than I was expecting,7,30 May 2012,"""Hanna"" was a pleasant surprise for me.Against all what I was expecting, this movie managed to be a pretty convincing action/thriller flick, with many effective action scenes, interesting characters, and an exciting story, despite some cheesy scenes.The main character is particularly fascinating. I think that what makes this film so effective is the performance done by Saoirse Ronan: She makes ""Hanna"" a believable character, which is deadly and merciless but completely innocent at the same time. Even in those scenes where this character kills her enemies it is very hard to not feel sympathy for her.""Hanna"" is a good film. It was very well directed and performed. Not even the most exaggerated or over the top parts of the story made it any less enjoyable. To be honest, I really hope to see the Hanna character in other film (sequel, prequel, or even an interquel) It would be something interesting to watch anyway.",Hanna
45,leplatypus,Skill : kill (tv),7,20 April 2014,"Based on a stupid script, this movie is after all watchable. Between James Cameron's « Dark Angel » and Stephen King's « Firestarter », it's about government hunting a highly « dangerous » teen. Sure, the techno babble, the cold war background are ridiculous but i let it go. Nowadays, i found it rather funny to see how this administration is similar with the « Empire » in Star Wars. Like Palpatine, their leaders just seem blinded by their paranoia and their troops look like the stormtroopers. In other words, they use power, guns, violence, treachery to pursue their private interest. However, the director is enough talented to find original angles and give rhythm. A big positive difference comes also from the multiple exotic locations (North, Marocco, Germany). But what really makes me watch it was its cast : just a little for Blanchett with her evil Scully look, a bit more for Bana who reminds me of Liam Neeson, a sort of big-heart and very athletic hero and definitely for Saoirse. It's a sign that nothing happen by luck as i have just discovered her in « GHB ». Even if she does violence here, she radiates a sweetness, a softness and a dedication that's rather uncommon today. As in ""GBH"", i really have the feeling to know her for a long time in spite of i have just seen 2 movies with her. In all cases, she is indubitably the kind of friend I wished to have met growing up and that's why her movies really talk to me.",Hanna
46,TheMovieDiorama,Hanna struggles to balance stylish girl power with dramatic coming-of-age development.,6,8 January 2019,"Wright is best known for acclaimed period British dramas that relish in classicism and Keira Knightley. So much to our surprise, he broke away from his comfort zone and directed this action thriller. For the most part, he succeeds. But, it is obviously clear that Wright is more comfortable with the dramatic elements as opposed to the supposedly exhilarating action sequences that ultimately did not work. Growing up in the middle of a forest with her father, Hanna braves the outside world where she is hunted by operatives. She is trained to be the perfect assassin, and it is with this central plot point that the theme of female empowerment and individualism reigns supreme. Ronan gives a transformative performance as she dives into a genre that is fairly unknown to her. Once the delicate father daughter relationship had been established, Hanna travels across Europe with a family she encounters, and it is during this time that we see her truly develop and experience a world unfamiliar to her. However, the vast amount of the runtime spent on her natural coming-of-age progression, meant that the main plot subsided, concluding in an underwhelming fashion (and unexpectedly instant!). Wright, unable to execute the action eloquently and excitingly due to over rehearsed cumbersome combat sequences, chooses to film what he is comfortable doing (despite The Chemical Brothers' euphoric score). A consequence of this is that it makes the other half of the film rather generic and unfortunately does not fully embrace its characters. Hanna herself occasionally feels cold as a character, despite a substantial amount of personable development. In fact, the entire plot was rather over-meticulous. Essentially, we have two genre films on offer. One is clearly better than the other, but with great supporting performances and rapid pacing, Hanna just about saves itself from being assassinated. It's unfortunate that both strands didn't come together as efficiently as I would've hoped for...",Hanna
47,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Satiating visual action thriller with impressive character depth,8,11 April 2011,"If Chloe Moretz's Hit Girl from ""Kick-Ass"" were a slightly more real person, I suppose she'd be Hanna. Saoirse Ronan might not utter the C-word, but her character provides the same level of entertainment plus a bit more, well, depth. Either way, the trend of ass-kicking children continues in Joe Wright's latest film, which succeeds as a great thriller just as ""Kick-Ass"" succeeded as a great superhero/comic movie spoof. A pure cat-and-mouse thriller with a bit more heart than usual, ""Hanna"" definitely goes above and more arguably beyond great action material.Saoirse Ronan proves her acting ceiling lies well beyond a fathomable distance as the titular character, a girl raised by her father (Eric Bana) somewhere near the arctic circle and trained to be a deadly assassin. Her father is ex-CIA and reads Hanna encyclopedia bed-time stories all while training her to eventually take out a woman named Marissa Viegler (Cate Blanchett), who works for the CIA and will apparently want to kill Hanna as soon as she knows where she is. In the first 15 minutes, Hanna proves she's old and skilled enough for her mission and it begins. After being contained and thinking she's killed Viegler, Hanna escapes and goes on the run from Viegler and the cronies she hires to track her down in Morocco, Spain and other parts of Europe. If any doubts existed as to whether the director of ""Pride and Prejudice"" and ""Atonement"" could pull off stylized action, they are quickly put to rest in ""Hanna."" Although Wright does continue his trademark of slowing down the pace on occasion to ogle the scenery including pans around characters, he psychs you up for the action sequences. Due credit to the phenomenal Chemical Brothers score for doing the same. The music simply electrifies the action sequences in a way few electronic film scores do in this genre.Other than music, the depth of character sets ""Hanna"" apart from similar chase flicks. Like Jason Bourne, Hanna struggles with identity, but she also has the lack of life experience. She hasn't had the experience of growing up as most girls do and she has no concept of society or other people for that matter. Wright plays this up in the excellent scene in a Moroccan hotel room when various elements of electric-powered items (which Hanna has minimal experience with) begin to go off at once.Ronan fits her role perfectly from the outside in. She possesses the pale-faced naïveté of a young girl with piercing blue eyes that switch almost instantly to unsympathetic killer. Inside she gives Hanna everything from calculated emotion to raw longing: a very complete profile of a girl who has been raised the way she has. Seth Lochhead and David Farr's script gives her the opportunity to deliver such full dimension, which gains more robustness as they play her off other characters such as Sophie (Jessica Barden), a British teenager on vacation with her family in Morocco who's a bit of a shallow brat but still desiring a real connection to someone her age. This might sound convenient, but Ronan looks to be developing the chops of co-star Blanchett. Blanchett is renowned for her versatility and adding tremendous characterization to her roles. Viegler, with her cold-blooded attitude and Country accent, could have easily been blown over-the-top by anyone with lesser ability. As with Ronan's performance, Blanchett's prowess starts with her distinct looks and travels down to the core of her characters. We have seen Ronan pull off nosy and mischievous (""Atonement""), innocent (""The Lovely Bones"") and now deadly. She has also never used her native Irish accent in a film, much like Blanchett almost never gets to be a natural Aussie.""Hanna"" only falters in scripting from a logistical sense, which Wright mostly covers up. The backstory and motivations of Hanna's father and Marissa Viegler are wishy-washy and the events that help the chase go from point ""A"" to point ""B"" seem illogical at times or uninspired. No example better captures this than when Bana takes an escalator into a subway when it's insanely obvious a character with his instincts would know he's being followed. However, the action sequence that occurs as a result hits the spot and effectively counters the fact that the scene is a total ploy.Wholly satisfying as an action film and thriller, ""Hanna"" showcases some positive trends in Hollywood from established musicians scoring films to formulaic stories that aim for depth ahead of action ingenuity. Thematic depth does lack a bit as the film tries to use symbolism and metaphor as adequate theme replacements, but they are intriguing and visually pleasing symbols and metaphors if it's any consolation. Regardless, from an entertainment perspective, ""Hanna"" offers great thrills.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",Hanna
48,jzappa,If Red Riding Hood Were Raised by the Big Bad Wolf,8,12 July 2011,"Owing mainly to Irish actress Saoirse Ronan and her reunion with director Joe Wright, Hanna is one of those films, perfect or not, that in any case controls and possesses our interest immediately from the first frames, a fairy tale in ultra-modern action cinema clothing, with stimuli that reach from The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser to Kick-Ass. It's a coming-of-age thriller, as much about the emotional passage as the urgent chase. The first living things we see in this the driving, forceful experience all seem veiled in their pure natural world: a white swan, a white fox, a white reindeer, a white girl. A reindeer is stalked in a snow-white clearing with bow and arrow. ""I just missed your heart,"" the prey is told with what might be remorse. It's tough to discern with Hanna. Eric Bana plays Erik, the CIA talent who has conditioned his daughter to be dangerously prepared for the inevitable confrontation with Marissa Wiegler, the collaborator to blame for their exile completely off civilization's radar.Erik's taught Hanna German, Italian, Spanish and English, and always to secure the advantage. She has an almanac's worth of information, but she's never heard music, nor anything of the outside world. As a teenager, it's reasonable that Hanna wants to see the outside world. But Erik has made it unmistakable: If she opts to leave, she must trigger a transponder mechanism and ward off those who will hunt her. The film charges. The cinematography is striking, building to a dreamlike sequence set in an abandoned Berlin amusement park, unraveling as a primeval folk tale about encountering a world both mesmerizing and treacherous.Who is Hanna, really? And why does Wiegler target her so relentlessly? Those are only two of the film's numerous long-term questions, which writers Seth Lochhead and David Farr unknot at a wisely protracted pace. There's also some well-handled comic respite in the paradigm-shifting appearance of a British family on vacation from whom Hanna gets a lift. Jessica Barden is a pleasure as the family's acerbic teenage daughter and, for a time, Hanna's first friend.The scarlet bob that a keenly alert Wiegler sports does nothing to melt the frost on her blood. Disregarding CIA procedure in her personal manhunt for Erik and Hanna, she commits with an private button man named Isaacs. Boyish Tom Hollander looks to have found a muse in the sinister detachment of rogues from A Clockwork Orange and Funny Games. He's quite satisfied with himself and his ill intentions. He whistles to work, and his cruel affairs effect civilian deaths.Front and center as an adventure lead for the first time, Ronan bears the banner convincingly, carrying Hanna's unusual capabilities and skill along with her interest and susceptibility through a world only familiar to her in books. She is a dutiful bludgeon first, curious teen second, equipped with a hardnosed expertise and a bewildered state of mind as she forges across Finland, Morocco, Spain and Germany. She repels men twice her size, and Ronan upholds an imperative detachment from the role's wide-ranging burden.As hunter, Blanchett puts on yet another of her brogues, with monogrammed gun, shoes to complement her gloves. Her initials create a smart zig-zag, her said matching gloves donned to manage her dirty work, which she's not beneath doing herself. She and Erik have a back story, naturally, but the key to what Wright does soright is immersing us in the subjective poetry of the atmospheric experience he creates, and so just as Hanna doesn't realize just how tethered her dad and enemy are, it neither dawns on us. Wright's style always keeps us in the pure immediate. There is a definite source of Hanna's inborn martial expertise, as demonstrated during Wright's signature logistically mind-boggling tracking shot, this time following Bana from a bus station down into a subway station.The score by the Chemical Brothers is a temperamental, dynamic thing, as crucial to the aura surrounding most of the imagery and thrills as the superbly intense fight compositions, and even the subtitles suggest a disciplined economy in their lower-case implementation. Wright shows range that, seeing the masterful Atonement, a perceptive viewer would know immediately that he innately had, and it's fascinating to see the same young actress he guided to an Oscar nomination exchange blows in the gritty brawl more persuasively than certainly any bodybuilder action hero in the past ten years. It's not what Hanna's about, it's how it's about it. And where it may not reinvent the wheel, it finishes the wood so that those old patterns don't seem as familiar this time.",Hanna
49,Vartiainen,"Decent, artistic action thriller",6,26 June 2015,"Hanna is a nice addition to the action genre. It has a strong female lead in Saoirse Ronan, whose character Hanna still feels very much like a young teenage girl underneath the deadly assassin she shows to the world. It's lethality and naivety mixed perfectly, exactly what you'd expect from a girl who has been raised completely isolated in Lapland wilderness.Though, to be fair, the plot of the movie is rather predictable and stereotypical in that you can pretty much tell how it's going to go from the first few minutes. Which can be a problem, especially because Hanna falls to certain clichéd shortcomings along her journey. She learns to feel emotions, to be a girl, et cetera, which is not necessarily what you'd want for a tough character like her. It's done well, which saves the movie, but it would have been nice to see something outside the norm.And that's actually a pretty good way to sum up the movie. It's clichéd, but done very well. The camera-work and the whole style aesthetic is phenomenal. The colours are lush, vibrant and just a hint misty, the fight scenes are exciting, the music works, the settings feel suitably exotic and the actors are talented. It's only the story that doesn't reach the same level of competence.Hanna has its merits and is worth a watch, especially if you like action movies with female leads. It's not a perfect movie by any means, but as far as action thrillers go, it's good.",Hanna
50,billcr12,worth it for ronan,7,27 November 2011,"Saoirse Ronan stars as Hanna, a teenage girl trained by her father, played by Eric Bana, to survive in the wilderness and to be an assassin. Ronan is superb in the lead, being on screen most of the time.Cate Blanchett is the villain here, as some kind of secret agent type. This is a surprising role for Blanchett and she carries it off with style.The problem is the story not the actors who are fine throughout. The action scenes are well done but nothing that we haven't seen before.The first 2/3 had me wondering what would happen next, but the last 1/3 was disappointing and convoluted, especially the ending which was utterly ridiculous.The cinematography and locations are great, as is the acting, so I give a 7 for effort.",Hanna

She is like a grown woman trapped in a teenage body. Ronan is quite a talented actress, I see an Oscar in her future.16 year old Hanna(Saoirse Ronan), lives in the woods with her father Erik(Eric Bana), an ex CIA agent, who has to flee, when a ruthless intelligence operative named Marisa(Cate Blanchard) and some agents find there hide out. They take Hanna into headquarters, but what there gonna discover that Hanna is not your typical teenager, afters of being trained by her father, Hanna has skills that make her a perfect assassin, I mean she is good at fighting, and is great with any weapon. Hanna quickly goes on the run, but will Marisa catch her, before she can get to her father? Saoirse Ronan is quite memorable here, playing it quite innocent and deadly. Eric Bana is good here also. But Cate Blanchett accent sounded quite phony, although she is a great villain here. This move has great fight scenes,. I like the way it mixes action with a coming of age like story.",Hanna
52,freemantle_uk,"""Sometimes children are bad people too""",10,8 May 2011,"When I first heard that Joe Wright was going to make a film about a teenage girl who is raised by her father to be the ultimate assassin I thought two things, first that Mr. Wright was annoyed that he did not get the Bond gig and second this film sounded a lot like Hit-Girl from Kick-Ass and Alias. But then I started reading up about the projected and I got excited and Hanna is easily one of the best films of 2011 so far.Starting in the Artic Circle Hanna (Saiorse Ronan) is a teenage girl raised by her father to hunt, fight, shoot and kill and to be ruthless. Her father Erik Heller (Eric Bana) is an ex-CIA officer who teaches her to think on her feet, her cover story and reads her an encyclopedia so she could memorise facts, but not to think emotionally. Erik tells Hanna of her mission, to kill a senior CIA Marissa Wiegler (Cate Blanchett) and leave her rustic lifestyle. When Hanna thinks she kills Marissa she goes on the run, meeting a family in Morocco. Marissa at the same time hires an assassin Isaacs (Tom Hollander) and some Neo-Nazis to hunt Hanna whilst she tries to find Erik.Hanna has everything going for it, a strong script with a lot of ideas, Wright showing his abilities as an action director, a great cast and a pumping soundtrack by the Chemical Brothers. One of the big themes is the idea of nature vs. nurture and about a girl who has lived a sheltered existence forced to go into the big bad world. Hanna is a girl who is longing for more, to actually experience music and she is amazed by technology. It shows that it is one thing to learn facts in dept, it is another to actually see it for yourself. Hanna herself was a character who could think factually and had a great memory, but Erik raised her in how to deal with intelligence officers. Her social skills with people are terrible and she does not know how to deal with ordinary people. Ronan was really great in the film, being totally believable as a girl with killer instincts but having to go into a strange world and ends up exploring her humanity despite being taught to be ruthless. Ronan was convicting in the action department, killing Special Forces and showing material arts skills. Her acting ability is continuing to grow.The rest of the cast is really good, especially Bana and Blanchett as old foes. Blanchett is sinister as a officer clearing up the loose ends of her failed own dark op and using the CIA to do it. Other notable cast members Olivia Williams as a woman who thinks that it is great for Hanna at the age of 16 to travelling and hitchhiking alone whilst her husband Jason Flyming is the voice of reason and questions this situation. Jessica Barden is a lot better in Hanna then she was in Tamara Drewe as an annoying teenager, who uses Hanna. Weirdly Barden looks younger then Ronan but is in fact older in real life.Wright shows real ability as an action director and I personally think its his best film to date. The action scenes were really well done and shows you do not need CGI or fancy editing. There are some stylist camera tricks, but one of the best moments was a continuous shoot following Erik from a Bus terminal to an underground station, being followed by CIA agents. The actually fight is quick, but there were no cuts and the build up was really key. Other major scenes are the escape from the CIA base with Hanna and the fight with the Neo-Nazis in the shipping yard. A little note for Paul Greengrass: an action scene is better when you can actually see what's happening! Because of the lack of CGI and overediting the film had a proper grittier edge. As well as the action Wright made sure there was a sure there was a heart and emotional core the film with Hanna having to discover the world and befriending a strange, but loving family.Some critics and commentators have mentioned that there is a fairy tale link to the film and there are some obvious references. The first is that Hanna has a copy of the Brothers Grimm's fairy tales and that one of the meeting points was at a Brothers Grimm's theme park, leading to one of the most surreal scene in a film for a long time. There are little hints like the wooden cabin having a fairy tale look, but I personally think of Hanna as a action spy thriller with a mystery edge.There are a few problems to the film, like wouldn't Erik see that one day that Hanna will need to take on Marissa and therefore he would need to ingrate his daughter into society, get her use to technology she would not be overawed and teach her thinks like CCTV, passports and money so she could avoid it or know how to use it. There is a small issue involving Marissa whom logic is to get people to find Hanna is some Neo-Nazi when she could take on a base of Special Forces troops. And there some unresolved issues and here are some SPOILERS: first what happened to the family, did Marissa kill them or let them go? Hanna never got to know much about her past like who is her real dad or find anything about her mother. The film does have a bit of an abrupt end, with Hanna simply killing Marissa, what is she going to do next? I think if there is going to be a sequel it will take a hell of a script to bring Wright and Ronan back.Overall Hanna is great fun film with a lot of substance.",Hanna
53,Polaris_DiB,Deliciously delivered pulp with a keen production value,8,20 August 2011,"Hanna is a good piece of modern genre pulp, in the way one could consider Source Code. It is a spy thriller with a unique enough concept to keep you actually interested in the story while it carefully sets up the action sequences to pay you off for your attention, and it is pretty well paced in terms of neither over or underdoing it. Its real skill is that it feels like Joe Wright and company sat down and said to each other, ""Okay, action films... so much has already been done, our audience is really jaded... what can we do to excite their eyes once more?"" What this means is that we get the gift of some actual thought in the production design. In other words, for the people who want to compare this to the Bourne trilogy, this movie actually has what a person could call ""action sequences"", not a ton of over-cut .2 second shaky hand cam in all closeups garbage. Not to say that this movie is exactly a paragon of reserve, either... you'll be surprised where the camera ends up going, with overhead shots, circle tracks, long steadicam sequences, and even the camera spinning upside down all edited together over a blissful enjoyment of choreography set to some mean Chemical Brothers beats. So that's where this movie's at.The story is decent: Hanna is a young girl trained by her father away from civilization to be, essentially, a CIA assassin, but as she gets let loose in the world, she both discovers a lot more about her past than she was meant to and also has to learn to navigate the social landscape as well as the geographic. Saoirse Ronan has that same Sissy-Spacek-from-3-Women otherworldly vibe that allows her mere presence to add to a sense of rising tension as other people try to figure out just who the heck she is and why she's there. What's really weird about that is that the movie felt intensely like it was setting up a reveal that Hanna was being used as a proxy by her father Erik (Eric Bana) so that he could pull some other stunt off, when it turns out that the continual setbacks and dilemmas Hanna confronts in her fairytale journey was just straight-up oversight. This makes the reveals really disappointing, because now they simply judiciously dole out the backstory as the audience needs without taking advantage of the limited knowledge and understanding we have as an audience stuck mostly in Hanna's perspective to eventually switch the endgame on us. At least, I was disappointed: this strikes me as the type of response most people won't worry about because for the most part, their viewing is rewarded by sadistically pleasurable characters and an underlining fairytale motif. With Marissa (Cate Blanchet) joyfully cleaning her wolf fangs and Isaacs the homosexual M homage lurking around like a whistling Nosferatu, story in some ways willingly takes second place to style as a not too bad cinematic choice. Besides, fairy tales are not actually renowned for their subtlety, so whether we're in the forest of innocence, or the belly of the mechanical beast as a laser tag Moroccan underground battlefield, or the maw of the wolf, or the carnival world of magicians (yes, all of this is exemplified), for the most part we have this sense that we might as well be on another planet, CIA storyline be damned.Unfortunately we do have to spend quite a bit of time with obnoxious Western tourists whose backstory and character development are basically described cinematically as, ""These loudmouth rich privileged Western tourists are loudmouthed, rich, and privileged. And they are from the West, and they are tourists. And in this scene, we'll drive the action by having one of them say something obnoxious."" This is mostly to give Hanna some inkling of the fact that her world is not the same as others', and that as much as she may desire friendship, she may not belong. Again, there was more to be done here that was pretty much dropped as soon as it no longer served the fairytale's purpose, and my feelings on that aspect are ambivalent because I certainly loved the pacing and did not particularly want to spend more time with those people.But all of this sounds like I'm giving Hanna a lot of guff, honestly its the movie with the most original feel I've seen yet far from 2011. Considering that my summer flick to-do list is down to Cowboys & Aliens and Captain America with perhaps an additional Rise of the Planet of the Apes, now that I've already seen Pirates of the Caribbean 4 and Cars 2 and Harry Potter 7.2, without a second thought avoiding Conan the Barbarian, The Smurfs, Transformers 3, and Fast Five, while it still remains to be seen if I'll get myself around to seeing Thor and X-men Prequel 2.... well, you get my point.--PolarisDiB",Hanna
54,dfranzen70,"Stunning, well-crafted thriller",8,10 April 2011,"Saoirse Ronan plays a 16 year old raised by her father (Eric Bana) to defend herself against those who would do her harm, which turns out to be quite a lot of people. She can kill and gut an elk, she can engage in hand-to-hand combat, and she can fire a weapon. Sort of leaves no room for toys and television, but her dad has good reason to fear for her safety – he's actually a former CIA officer who's gone rogue, missing from the world for a long time.The time finally comes, though, when Hanna feels she is ready to deal with the world. Father Erik shows her a transmitter he's kept hidden away all this time; if she truly believes she is ready, he tells her, she need only to flip the switch, and the CIA will come after her. He and Hanna make plans to meet up in Berlin, and off we go with the thrust of the plot.Hanna isn't ordinary, her odd upbringing notwithstanding. She has amazing strength and reflexes and is a tremendously quick learner (her dad teaches her from old encyclopedias). Sure enough, she flips that switch, and sure enough, the CIA is quickly on the scene, thinking that although it's lost its primary target (Erik), they at least have his scared, vulnerable daughter. Oh, how they wrong they are.Hanna must navigate her way from detention by the authorities to her scheduled rendezvous with her father in Berlin, which as you all know is quite a distance from the North Pole. Mostly she walks, but she does manage to ingratiate herself into a traveling family for a short time, becoming friends with the daughter, played by Jessica Barden. Hanna's able to use the family to get her into Europe, at least, all the while being pursued by German assassins at the behest of Erik's longtime CIA handler, Marissa (Cate Blanchett).I think that any movie in which female characters are shown to be strong and resourceful – and that these qualities are depicted as positive, not negative – is one to be lauded. Hanna and Marissa are well matched; each is capable of kicking butt and declining to take names, each is personable but ruthless and single minded. They're not easy women to defeat.The movie is tightly plotted (written by Seth Lochhead, his first feature), doling out pieces of information about Hanna's past as if they were the remaining rations on a deserted island, and although there is plenty of action – and some terrific choreography – none of it distracts from the plot itself. Sometimes, a lesser film will lean heavily on those action pieces as a bit of sleight of hand, all to prevent the viewer from putting two and two together. Here, it's more like the square root of eight plus pi. I overstate it, but you get the drift. Not everything means something, and some things mean everything.The film is also quickly paced and expertly shot (by Alwin Kuchler) – again, without making things into such a blur that a fist and a blunt instrument blend into interchangeable weapons. Most of the fight scenes look as if they are actually taking place, which is probably true; the film never has a CGI feel to it, although it wouldn't surprise me if some of those stunts just plain had to be technically created.Hanna is a terrific thriller that does not depend heavily on visual effects to engage the viewer, instead merely using them to supplement a well-written plot with no gaping holes. It's electric mayhem, to borrow from The Muppets, with dual towering performances by Ronan and Blanchett, the former making up for her earlier work in Atonement (directed by Joe Wright, who helmed Hanna). Ronan in Atonement was annoying, wooden, and obnoxious; Ronan in Hanna has grown up, steely, resolved, and deep. She's a real pleasure to watch here, and she carries the film.",Hanna
55,PWNYCNY,Be careful about how you raise a child.,9,29 April 2011,"This off-beat movie is entertaining because of one person, the young lady who plays the title role. Hanna is the hapless product of an experiment that goes awry, and as a result she has socialization issues, not unlike the so-called monster created by Dr. Victor Frankenstein, except in this case, the young lady is actually human and the tampering is sociological and psychological. Being programmed to be violent, Hanna is violent but her violence is neither wanton nor arbitrary. She is capable of forming friendships and will not harm anyone who is defenseless. And her attractive yet almost tomboyish appearance makes her even more appealing. Eric Bana's performance as the father is acceptably controlled and low key. However, Cate Blanchett's performance is incredible. She plays a combination angry mother-figure and merciless bureaucrat who is driven by personal and professional issues to capture the renegade father and daughter, both of whom have knowledge and skills that she wants, at any price. This movie is worth watching, if for no other reason as an dramatization of how child-rearing can effect one's development.",Hanna
56,iquine,A Good Foundation For the TV Series,7,17 January 2020,"(Flash Review)I watched the first season of the TV show before the movie and they are very similar, just less build out of assorted story points. Hanna is was raised in the woods after her father escaped with her as an infant. He raised her tough like a soldier for the day the people they fled from come looking for her. The CIA are those people and when Hanna and father resurface, they embrace the challenge of kill or be killed. The cat and mouse progresses through Europe where Hanna befriends a typical family and learns about being normal teenager while concealing her true identity, abilities and killer instincts. Watch as CIA agent Blanchett attempts to outfox Hanna and father. Who will be left standing? Full of energetic electronic music, gritty actions scenes, decent moments of teenage innocents and solid acting and cinematography.",Hanna
57,barnabyrudge,"Far fetched nonsense, entertaining in a weird way though not at all as amazing as certain people would have us believe.",5,10 January 2012,"Judging by the number of rave reviews received by ""Hanna"", one would expect it to be an absolutely incredible thriller. I must confess that, while I wasn't overly optimistic about the idea of a film about a child assassin, the film's Euro-art-house approach led me to expect something unique, refreshing and wonderful. Unfortunately, ""Hanna"" emerges as something of a disappointment. Yes, it is unique in a number of ways but it certainly isn't refreshing or wonderful. The whole thing is an exercise in style over substance, with too many frustrating logic loopholes and narrative inconsistencies.Hanna (Saoirse Ronan) is a teenaged girl brought up in the frozen wastes of Finland by her father Erik (Eric Bana), a rogue ex-CIA agent with a personal agenda against the agency. Trained to be a master of languages and combat, as well as a fount of knowledge, Hanna is taught that when she is ready she will be allowed to trigger a homing device which will alert the CIA to their whereabouts. The plan is to lure into the open Marissa Wiegler (Cate Blanchett), a devious agency boss who was responsible for the human endurance experiment which Hanna has been part of since birth. Wiegler pulled the plug on the experiment years earlier, intending to kill everyone involved with it. Erik and baby Hanna escaped, and have spent the intervening years preparing their revenge. Taken to a secret base in North Africa, Hanna single-handedly attempts to fulfil her mission before making her getaway to the rendezvous point in Berlin, where she hopes to reunite – alive and victorious – with her dad.With such a hugely improbable plot, the film never even pretends to concern itself with reality. Instead, it focuses on Hanna's bizarre experiences in the real world once she is away from everything she has ever known (chiefly, the freezing Finnish wilderness). Sadly, her adventures in the 21st century world are alternately pointless and unbelievable. Hanna's absolute lack of worldly experience makes the whole assassination mission with which she has been entrusted preposterous in the extreme. Even the sound of music and electrical household objects make Hanna freak out wildly, so quite how Erik thought she could genuinely survive out there is beyond belief. To disguise the gaping credibility issues, director Wright bombards the viewer with visual and aural tricks. Every action sequence is accompanied with swirling camera work and pounding electronic rock music; weird camera angles are used for even the simplest scenes; and the combat scenes are carried out in typically OTT fashion. ""Hanna"" remains modestly entertaining (especially if you disengage the brain), but overall it comes across as a rather absurd and empty exercise which wastes an intriguing premise.",Hanna
58,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Absolutely fantastic action fairy tale,10,15 February 2016,"Joe Wright's Hanna started as a Vancouver Film School script, funded through grants that would make it the catalyst for the positively unique, incendiary action fairy tale that it is today. It's crowd pleasing without any superficiality, straight to the point without being over serious, and is made with a slick, vibrant aesthetic that will have your pulse dancing a jig in time with the thumping score by The Chemical Brothers. I held off on seeing this one for years after its initial release, jaded by the prospect of another 'killer genetically altered female assassin' flick. One night I finally caved and took a peek on Netflix. I then kicked myself hard for not taking notice sooner, purely on the notion that I wouldn't dig it based on its formula. I suppose I learnt a little 'book by its cover' lesson there, as I was completely enamoured with the film and have seen it at least ten times since then. The tired ingredients of any old formula can be whipped up into a tantalizing new recipe, providing all those involved have the commitment and passion. The filmmakers of Hanna go for broke with one of the best thrillers in years. Saoirse Ronan is an explosive, feral waif as the titular hero, raised in isolation by her badass ex CIA father Erik Heller (underrated Aussie Eric Bana nails the German accent to a T). They reside in the frozen tundras of Lapland, where Erik trains her in the ways of a warrior, instilling survivalism in both physical and intellectual measures, preparing her for their inevitable separation. An enemy from Erik's past surfaces in the form of evil CIA witch Marissa Wiegler (Cate Blanchett practically breathes fire with a naughty southern accent and a red hairdo that looks acidic to the touch), and both Hanna and him are forced to run, separated from each other. She escapes from a remote facility and begins her journey across Europe, befriended by a lovable squabbling family of travellers, igniting a yearning for companionship in her that Ronan expertly shows the camera. Wiegler enlists the slimy help of a euro trash club owner who moonlights as some sort of freelance über villain (Tom Hollander almost walks away with the movie as the psychopathic, bleached blonde pervo Deutsch-bag) who relentlessly pursues Hanna along with his neo nazi skinhead henchman. The thing about this film is that it's all been done before, but they find a way to make it fresh, exciting and strike chords which simply haven't been hit in this sub genre before, providing a film experience that really sticks. Ronan has never been more virile and effective, also proving a mastery of the German accent and embodying Hanna with intense physicality that's achingly punctuated by a gradual awakening as a person as well. Impressive balance is shown in her character arc, through writing and stunt work alike. This is the first movie to be scored by The Chemical Brothers, and damn I hope we get more. They belt out a technicolor rhapsody of electric music that flows beautifully with the story, hitting every beat, ramping up suspense when needed, being surprisingly weird at times and kicking around your head long after the credits roll. The actors are all easy listening with the dialogue, never feeling forced or making us doubt for a minute that these aren't real people engaged in genuine interaction. The film neither drags nor rushes, arriving at its often grisly, sometimes touching and always entertaining conclusions exactly when it needs to. It shows uncanny intuition with its pacing, an absence of the need to show off with unnecessary fights or effects which don't serve the story, and above all a keen desire to entertain us. Terrific stuff.",Hanna
59,3xHCCH,Cold-Blooded and Detached,5,28 September 2011,"Saoirse Ronan is a unique young actress in that all her films so far are very unusual. We knew her first in ""Atonement"", then in the ""The Lovely Bones"", both dark dramas that got Oscar Award consideration. We see a new Saoirse here in ""Hanna"" as this wan, frail-looking lass as a kick-ass cold-blooded assassin.The titular character Hanna was brought up by her dad Erik (Eric Bana) in the wilds of Finland, seemingly with one aim in mind -- to train this girl to be the perfect killer exact revenge on the CIA, represented by the vile agent Marissa (Cate Blanchett). Saoirse Ronan looked so weak to be credible as a killer, but as the movie progressed on, she was actually convincing. Eric Bana was absent from the big screen since ""Munich"" and ""Troy,"" but he did not really make much impact here. Cate Blanchett looked like she was having fun playing the relentlessly evil antagonist.The action sequences are fast and cartoonish. Everyone plays it over- the-top. There are plenty of illogical scenes, like how did the postcard reach the father, and many others. The counter-balancing sequences where Hanna tries to make friends for the first time were awkwardly composed. I think you are supposed to watch this movie only for the ""cool"" superhuman fight scenes. You are expected to be cold-blooded and detached to enjoy this film.",Hanna
60,TdSmth5,The same and yet different.,7,2 October 2012,"Hanna is a unique teen. She's being raised by her survivalist dad isolated way out somewhere in the Finnish woods. She knows how to fight and kill and has memorized the encyclopedia but has no experience of the world or other people. One day Hanna decides it's time- time to go out there in the world and confront someone named Marissa Wiegler who wants to kill her.Hanna lets herself be taken captive to get close to Wiegler. She ends up in some facility somewhere in the desert but escapes and befriends a hippie family, with Wiegler's people always on her trail. We don't know exactly what the dad is up to but he promised to meet Hanna in Germany. Wiegler now goes after the family of Hanna's mother who died in a car crash/assassination when Hanna was little. We also learn that Hanna was the result of some science experiment to create super soldiers. Eventually they will all meet up for the climax.Hanna succeeds as long as it focuses on action and intrigue. This is an interesting teen girl alternative version of Jason Bourne and the story is evidently fairly similar. You are always waiting and expecting Hanna to blow up and beat the hell out of people, but that doesn't happen enough unfortunately. Our villains are quite sinister. But this movie isn't happy just being an action movie, it has to be something else, and that's when it's at its weakest. The overly liberal hippie family is surprisingly annoying; you would expect a movie to glorify them. The whole fairy tale aspect doesn't really add anything to the movie other than settings we don't see too often. This director pays attention to details, he knows how to film action and tender moments as well, but this movie is too unfocused, it tries to do more than it needs to. Nevertheless, it's entertaining and enjoyable in spite of its weaknesses.",Hanna
61,peterp-450-298716,A surprisingly terrific movie,8,23 March 2014,"Marissa, did she turn out as you hoped? Marissa: ""Better.""I had no idea what to expect from this movie. I'm not the type that reads opinions upfront as a guide. Usually it's the opposite of what I thought anyway.Hanna, beautifully played by Saoirse Ronan, was trained for years by her father in Finland to perform a task which is to liquidate Marissa Wiegler. This cold lady was the one who killed her mother because she had to make sure that there were no witnesses anymore of a secret experiment with DNA. An experiment in order to grow a superior human being. A kind of super-soldier. Hana was the last witness.Well, that's the whole story in a nutshell. I also expected a kind of ""Jason Bourne""-like spy thriller with lots of action and suspense. However, it didn't work out that way.First there were a few things that I still had some questions about. If that was the only goal she had to fulfill, why didn't she just return to the snowy plains? What was Erik's goal in Germany? Why the hell would you inform your target about your actions by means of the transmitter? Was it just to start things up and it just was a trick so she would be detained? As a super-soldier, maybe I would have handled it differently. How come she reacts so frantic when it's about electricity, while she has an encyclopedic knowledge about all kinds of things? An itinerant family meets her in the middle of the Sahara and won't ask her any question? Wouldn't you as a teenager tell your parents? What happened to the family in the end ? And something what really was a bit odd was the fact that she could eliminate commandos in an extremely precise way, but the confrontation with two brainless skinheads and an asthmatic fag, suddenly appears to be a huge obstacle ?Clear. A story with plot holes as large as the galaxy. But still ...Yet this was a gem of a movie. Why? Because it's all shown, filmed and told in a different way like most action-espionage thrillers. The opening scenes in the bleak landscape of Finland were sublime. From there the movie attracted my attention and didn't let go. The images of the desert and Morocco were magnificent and desolate as they should be. The maze of corridors and tunnels in the underground base gave a disorienting feeling. The city of Berlin was shown in such a way you could feel the chaos and obscurity of that metropolis. The whole film has an art deco, experimental and surreal tint. At times I thought it was a complete freak-show and a split second later I thought it was brilliant.The character Hanna is sophisticated. A fragile girl that DNA-wise was programmed into a cool effective killing machine. Her cold-blooded accuracy in actions is in contrast with those bright blue eyes that are sometimes shown in close up and shows just how vulnerable she is.Erik is a former CIA agent and ""That's it"". He shows no emotions or feelings. A focal point in his life and a main goal to perform. Marissa is a weird twisted plastic figure who brushes her teeth until they bleed. A subtle detail to show that she pursues perfection in everything she does. A tough cookie to kill what is clearly noticeable in the underground base. She always was a step ahead. Knepler is a weirdo who just crawled from under a mushroom. A clown looking like Catweazle. Isaacs and his two stupid hopping mad skinheads look totally wrong and ridiculous, but still fit into the whole picture. Isaacs in his tracksuit and laughable tennis outfit looks totally ridiculous. And the family in the dessert is a parody of new-age parents with a snobby teenage daughter. Hilarious in a specific way.So it is the overall picture of Kubrick-like surrealistic images, mixed in a dark and obscure ""The Chemical Brothers"" soundtrack, that made this such an interesting movie. A surreal tale full of symbolism in which the choreography and the camera-moves brings the whole to a higher level. The action scenes were not technical feats, but were not important in the overall scheme of the film. They were pleasant interruptions in this for the rest very arty film.More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/",Hanna
62,Samiam3,"Medium good thriller, (some parts strong, some parts weak)",6,25 September 2011,"Hanna is a traditional, on-the-run thriller, but it's one with an elegance and maturity to it. Visually Stimulating, and constantly motivating, Hanna is enjoyable for about an hour, but like many films, it wobbles during the climax. The film wraps itself up with far less coherency closure than it needed. The finished product is acceptable, but not great, which is a bit of a shame.Saorice Ronan carries the movie very well. She is emotionally vivid and mesmerizing all the way through. Eric Bana as well delivers his best performance in years (having hit a few low notes since Munich) Cate Blanchett I was not so keen on. She is utterly confused in the role. Her accent (whatever it's supposed to be) is dangerously fake, her mannerisms change with every scene, and as a bad guy, she's boring. The whole film is photographed very well, which may be the best thing about Hanna. It's a visually diversity of the film reminded me a little of Brian de Palma's better days, and like wise, director Joe Wright, once again, demonstrates the possibilities of a super long take.My problems with Hanna lie with the ending. certain aspect of Hanna are memorable, but when it was over I felt like I'd seen this material before. The film has street smart's but it's a little underwhelming with story and a little challenged in conclusion. That doesn't necessarily mean it's not a film worth seeing.

64,jadepietro,A-hunting We Will Go!,7,11 April 2011,"( Recommended ) Once upon a time, in a far off kingdom, there lived a fair-haired maiden named Hanna, who was raised by her kind and loving father, a former rogue C.I. A. agent. Now Hanna was no ordinary child. She had an unique talent than most children her age. Shielded from the wicked world and home schooled by her single and stern parent, Hanna obediently learned the three R's: reading, writing, and ripping out another person's throat in the blink of an eye ( Although it seems music and the arts are not a part of her curriculum. So much for a well rounded education! So much for an effective voucher system! ) Hanna lived there, in her private forest, where she stayed and flourished in her formative teenage years. But in another part of the world lived an evil and vengeful wicked queen who wanted her vengeance on this family and set out on a plan to fulfill her evil deed.￼Thus begins Joe Wright's Hanna, a well crafted but violent twist on the old Grimm ( perhaps, Grim is a more accurate term ) Brothers' variety of fairy tales. The talented young actress with the hard-to-pronounce name, Saoirse Ronan, changes gears from victim roles to a teenage assassin in this action-packed thriller. Raised and trained by her survivalist father ( Eric Bana ), Hanna is a mean lean killing machine who is being chased across Europe by other espionage agents guided by a ruthless female boss played by Cate Blanchett who has secrets of her own and very ulterior motives.Wright certainly has a visual eye for his films, as proved by his previous films, Pride and Prejudice and Atonement ( although he did falter with The Soloist ). His fluid camera movement and tracking technique are his stylish signature and Hanna carries his trademark panache. Two set pieces are particularly impressive: Hanna's escape through the cement labyrinth of passageways from her imprisonment chamber and her chase through a deserted amusement park. This is a stylish exercise in a genre that he has not been privy to and his showmanship is quite evident. ( Special mention also to cinematographer Alwin H. Kucher and film editor Paul Tothill for their valuable contributions to this film. )Yes, there are major loopholes in logic as to why our heroine is able to globetrot all over Europe without food, money, or clothes and yet is able to get by with some of those luxuries. Characters are introduced and dispatched without much fanfare. The pulsating techno-score by the Chemical Brothers helps to move the action along rather nicely, although it predictably signals another chase sequence once too often. But some of the images are stark and very dramatic ( white swan boats bobbing on the waterways, a bizarre hut filled with mushrooms hanging like stalactites in a red-lit room, a giant wolfs' head sculpture with its mouth gaped open,displaying its sharp white teeth).￼However, it's the film's screenplay by Seth Lochhead and David Farr that disappoints with its simplistic vision, making the film not worthy of all the talent on display. The overwrought tweaking of the story to the fairy tale origins of yore is somewhat heavy-handed, bordering on a campy but amusing tongue-in cheekiness that, at least, gives the film some bravado ( as does Blanchett's performance as the cold-hearted witch ). Still, Hanna is a high octane action film for the art house set with a little gore thrown to the masses. As a moviegoer, we may not leave the theater with a happy-ever-after feeling, but you will be certainly be completely sated by the film's visceral assault on your senses.

65,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,Hanna (2011),9,12 December 2011,"There's a surplus of female spy/assassin movies these days. Most are overly sexualized misguided attempts at feminism. Hanna doesn't suffer from such generic nonsense as it focuses on a young girl trained by her father to kill a single target. Ronan is exceptional in her role as a curious teenager bred to be the ultimate killer. We don't learn too much about these characters, which is harmful in some spots, but mostly their interactions tell us everything we need to know. If you're worried about this being your usual action espionage thriller, you can rest easy that it soon takes a brand new turn. Hanna meets up with a middle class English family enjoying their holidays. This is the perfect opportunity for Wright to display what Hanna has missed out on all these years, and also gives him the opportunity to flex some comedic muscles. The end is pure fairytale. From the gorgeous setting of an abandoned theme park, to each character drawing parallels with fairytale counterparts. The action is also handled with confidence, showing clearly the fights and thrills. Bana's subway fight is particularly memorable in an Oldboy hallway kind of way. A film that shows freshness can be injected into any familiar sub-genre.",Hanna
66,aimless-46,Unique,8,12 January 2012,"""Hanna"" is basically a strange blend of ""The Golden Compass"" (2007) and ""The Passenger"" (1975); with a little ""THX 1138"" (1971) thrown in for production design and atmospheric purposes.Had ""Hanna"" (2011) been promoted for what it was, a relatively low-budget, live-action, PG-13 allegorical fairy tale; with a uniquely quirky performance by Saoirse Ronan, it would be better regarded by the movie going public. Rather than the minimalist promotion and distribution this type of film normally receives, for some reason the distributors decided that it had the potential to make big money.So they threw almost as much money into marketing as had gone into production, sold the film as an action adventure suspenseful spy story, with another Chloe Moritz type hit girl. They utilized a saturation booking technique normally reserved for their weaker blockbusters. This technique involves a lot of pre-release publicity and then opening it simultaneously in many theaters, with the goal of generating quick profits before bad reviews and word of mouth kill attendance.The result was a lot of viewers who rightly felt that the film did not live up to its blockbuster billing, and a failure to appreciate the good points of the film. And there are some very good points. Ronan's earnest portrayal of the title character, a juvenile assassin and good daughter, rings true despite being unlike any character in cinema history. Ronan manages to blend a bubbly enthusiasm for the newness of everything she missed growing up away from the world (think of a younger version of the Anne Francis ""Alta"" character in ""Forbidden Planet"") with the deadly but ""fish-out-of-water"" qualities of Arnold Schwarzenegger's ""new-to-the-20th-century"" robot in ""Terminator 2"" (1991). Ronan has effectively played the bubbly stuff before, most notably in ""City Of Ember"" (2008). In ""Hanna"" she effortlessly slips back and forth between bubbly wonderment and analytic processing. These contrasting persona's are delivered so effectively (and in so many languages) that the overall performance ranks among the best in cinema history.And credit director Joe Wright with the vision to stage sequences and POV shots that make Hanna small and vulnerable, enough so to evoke a feeling of protectiveness toward her from viewers. Altman's ""Kansas City"" (1996) comes to mind, in which Jennifer Jason Leigh's tough talking gun moll created a powerful bond of identification with the viewing audience.The film is a fairy tale and the good vs evil dynamic is more allegorical than precise. Cate Blanchett plays a high level CIA operative who functions as the wicked witch. Basically Snow White's evil queen step-mother masquerading as a cross between the Rosa Klebbs character in ""From Russia With Love"" (1963) and Kidman's character in ""Golden Compass"" (in fact Nicole Kidman's ""Goldren Compass"" character was also named Marisa). She is assisted by the versatile Tom Hollander, a Wright regular (Mr. Collins from ""Pride & Prejudice""). Blanchett's Marissa is evil and menacing without the redemption dimensionality of Kidman's ""Golden Compass"" Marisa. Wright could have had much more fun with Hollander's character, but even so the minion is far more effective than his distaff master.Wright is not trying to be plausible, if anything the story is more expressionism than realism. This becomes especially obvious late in the film when the action switches to the huge abandoned Spreepark entertainment center in Berlin. The park was closed in 1999 and the decaying fairy tale related rides and attractions are a production designer's dream. These become a key motif of the film, much like the abandoned Salt Air Pavilion in ""Carnival of Souls"". Also watch for the existential connection between Hanna and Laika, the Soviet dog-in-space; torn from their world to be passengers through a world in which they do not belong. Bottom line, I am going to recommend the film. But with the advice to watch it for Ronan's performance and for its uniqueness; and to not try to place it into any neat classification.Then again, what do I know"", I'm only a child.",Hanna
67,rgkarim,A different action thriller than portrayed,8,9 April 2011,"When I first saw the trailer for Hanna many moons ago, I thought we were going to have an action filled drama with a little girl who liked to scream. Instead I got something much more artistic and deeper than what was portrayed in the trailers. Instead of having this little girl jumping off walls, throwing knives, and firing arrows and guns, this movie focused on character development and discovery. A majority of the film centered on the protagonist's development as a person and how she is introduced to a new world. The things that we take for granted such as phones, computers, and TV are seen in different eyes through this movie and it leads one to realize how much stuff we take for granted. What's even more brilliant is how well Ronan captures the surprise and feelings of this girl. Her transformation into an emotionless, cold blooded doll into a real, normal human being is well acted and captured by Ronan. The camera work as well helps bring the character to life, making sure to capture the perfect angle and lighting for Hanna's various moods. The well written dialog was also a plus for this movie, as it was not too silly or too dragged out. There were countless one liners that made me chuckle or laugh. Other scenes had intense dialog exchange that agreed with the cast's acting styles. I was very glad to see these dramatic scenes well acted instead of some over dramatic, sob filled, short of breath speaking like in Twilight.However, one thing this movie also must be credited with is the brilliant musical score that goes along with this movie. The Chemical Brothers have designed the music to really capture the setting and pace of the film. Sometimes it could be casual background music that went with the melancholy talk between characters, other scenes had a creepy techno child tone to it that added a little suspense to the scene, and some scenes were filled with a wild, fast paced techno to get the adrenaline flooding during the action scenes. Perhaps one thing that also stands out in this movie, is that the action supports the story not the other way around. How many times have we recently seen an action movie have nothing but fast paced fights and very little story to explain the fighting. That's not the case in this movie. Instead we have short action sequences that pick up the pace of the movie and spur on the adrenaline rush. This approach is what makes this action movie great, just like the great movies of the past like Star Wars and Star Trek.Although there is a lot of great things about this movie, there are still a lot of things that did not impress me. The first thing was the predictability of the movie. I found it very easy to predict what was going to happen in the movie and who was going to be killed next. Not too mention there wasn't a lot of depth or surprise to why they wanted her Hanna and her father. In fact the trailer really reveals about 75% of the reason for why they are chasing after them. As a result I was a little bored by the plot of the movie. The next thing was how Cate Blanchett's accent grew thicker and thicker as the movie went on. This accent actually got in the way of getting into the dark and serious nature her character was supposed to show. She still acted well, I just didn't think it was her strongest role. Another thing was some of the fight scenes had choppy camera action to them and seemed to get in the way of again trying to show some of the limited action seen in this movie. If camera work does not bother you, then you should have no problems and be okay with the action scenes. Perhaps another major weakness, especially for action lovers, is the limited amount of action seen in this movie. Although it is good that the action supports the story, there are very few fast paced scenes and they only last for a minute or two at most. It also takes a while to get to these action scenes, and many action lovers may become bored and disappointed. Perhaps a little more action could have added some more character to the movie. Finally for my last weakness that I caught, the ending really just appeared. I didn't feel like there was really any closure or idea where it was going and was a little disappointed with it. This may be hinting at a sequel, but if not then fans may be disappointed with how this drama finishes up.So now it is time for my final rating. Again I wish to applaud the direction this movie took and was happy with the acting, writing, music, and action supporting the story. However, the scarcity of action scenes, and the predictability of the story are two things that really weaken this film, at least in my opinion. Overall I would have to say this movie deserves somewhere between a 7 and 8 for its unique nature. I'm going to give it an 8 for most of the audience I think will like the story. Again I have no idea how predictable movies are for a person or how much you like seeing a little girl run. Action lovers I would recommend wait on this one as again the action is scarce and far in between. Until next time, enjoy the movies and if I can improve on my writing please email me at rgkarim@mail.roanoke.edu.",Hanna
68,p-stepien,Missing the drift,3,26 September 2011,"Somewhere hidden in the Arctic circle live Erik (Eric Bana) and Hanna (Saoirse Ronan). Erik is an ex-special operative, who resigned from service shortly after the Cold War, taking with him a infant Hanna to whom he gifted his life, career and love. Schooling her in the arts of espionage and assassination she is trained from a child to be a ruthless killing machine, but not one devoid of love and emotion. However children grow up and Hanna is increasingly curious of the outside world. She is told by Erik that the only way to freedom is through the killing of Marissa (Cate Blanchett), a CIA agent with a dark and unclear past.I took the chance on this movie after seeing the high ratings on IMDb, hence I can't help but question the appeal of this movie. In an attempt of copying the success of Nikita it surges forward impressively in the same direction during the initial act of the movie. Through the cold winter of Syberia to the rocky desert of Morocco Hanna shows off her metal and training to escape the 'bad guys'. There she stumbles upon an English family, who inadvertently take her in and start teaching her how to be more or less normal (given how wacky the family itself is). From here on in the logic and construct of the movies opening go into tailspin. The character of Hanna undergoes drastic character changes, which are in no way warranted. From a ruthless killer singlehandedly disposing of trained platoons of soldiers she turns into the protagonist in ""Run, Lola, Run"", who struggles to cope with a couple of skinhead dimwits. But she is not the only character with troubled character building, as neither Erik nor Hanna nor any of the supporting cast really seem to be too friendly with logic. And if that happens than the story itself ends up being an unequivocal mess.Simultaneously the drama and flow of the movie take a hit, when we go into sleeper mode, as Joe Wright attempts to do some character building, only to fail with a big fat letter 'F'. The somewhat layered character of Hanna feels like she is being dragged down, flattened and exposed. Unfortunately summing the flaws up it fails in delivering a manageable plot/story or some well-worked drama to make it memorable (as ""Nikita"" or ""Leon""). By the final act the suspense and thrill factor fizzles out completely, which left me waiting patiently for end credits. Finally given this is in the end nothing more than an action flick it fails to uphold the enthralling action of the opening sequences and ends with a veritable anticlimax.The cinematography remains top-notch throughout and the use of music during action sequences is praiseworthy. So basically tech credits are exceptional. But really how many films can you watch simply because they were well filmed and edited?",Hanna
69,nancyldraper,A Mixed Bag,6,8 April 2019,"This was a mixed bag. Saoirse Ronan, Eric Bana and Cate Blanchette are all spectacular performers in their own right so it is justified to think this would be a movie worth watching. My issues with it were all the directorial choices: instead of allowing the story to speak for itself, Joe Wright seemed to leaned toward the bizarre and surreal: The Chemical Brothers soundtrack and the soundscape were jarring and an unfortunate cacophony, Tom Hollander's character and the neo-fascist thugs, the closing location and its fantastic bent (and even Cate Blancette's southern drawl) were all distractions from what could have been a straight forward, gripping thriller. I'm so glad the premise was picked up for an Amazon Prime TV series. The movie missed the mark. I give this film a 6 (fair) out of 10. {Action Adventure Thriller}",Hanna
70,intelearts,428th Review: Meh... (and I wish it wasn't so)....,5,11 June 2011,"The trailer held so much promise, but this really is a half-stinker half-brilliant film about a child assassin that goes from preposterous to intriguing to ludicrous to thrilling like its stuck in a revolving door.Partly the script, well, mainly the script actually, this film has good concepts, some coherence, and then some blatantly wild swings which don't help at all.All in all, it is fun to watch, for the most part, but that part of you that wants the brain and heart to be truly engaged is sorely lacking - it would have been a much better film with orphan - training - assassin job- hunted - etc; too much going on that should give it a Bourne feel, and what we get is barely above the line...",Hanna

72,saadgkhan,"Hanna is daring & unexpected, Almost perfect!",8,9 June 2011,"HANNA – CATCH IT ( A- ) Hanna is daring & unexpected, it's doesn't look like a typical Hollywood thriller. The whole vibe of Hanna is European and somehow it supports its content as well. The movie starts with breathtaking views in the middle of Finland, where we see Hanna"" Saoirse Ronan"" taking shot at reindeer. From that shot to next 30minutes, the movie gives you a heart pumping adrenaline rush. It's amazing. I won't reveal the story a lot here, which rests on a very thin plot. So, Hanna's meeting with a touring family in Morocco not only releases the stress from the movie's heavy tone but also provide a slight humor. Saoirse Ronan and Jessica Barden's chemistry as friends is amazing and watching them riding with boys and enjoying the Moroccan traditional music was great. Things like these make this movie more real than its sci-fi element. On one hand where I admire Joe Wright's great direction but on the other hand I am little e disappointed in the writing department. The whole sci-fi element in the story becomes quite predictable & makes it common too. Plus the ending seems In-Complete, what happens to Hanna? or what will happens to Hanna? These kind of questions keep coming in your head when it's over. These few flaws make this movie almost perfect. Now let's talk about performances, Hanna completely rests upon Saoirse Ronan shoulders and it's interesting to see how she evolve herself so much into the character that you forget that she is just a teenager or an actress. Saoirse Ronan is extremely powerful & a scene stealer. Jessica Barden is really impressive and her chemistry with Saoirse is great. Eric Bana and Cate Blanchett are strong supporting characters but there is no background to their characters besides the He is the Father (Kind of) & she is a Villain. Overall, with exquisite locations, fast paced gripping tempo and brilliant performances , so far the best movie of 2011 I've seen.",Hanna
73,oneguyrambling,"Has it's moments, but ultimately little more than Hanna (Montana) Salt.",5,28 December 2011,"There are more than a few similarities to last year's Salt in Hanna.She too was raised in particularly hard circumstances, with her everyday routine starting with hunting, weapons training, and hand to hand combat, and concluding with languages and general knowledge, including whale testicles Tough right? Well might I add that Hanna also grew up in a remote shack with no electricity or mod-cons, and that she was randomly set to by her 'Pa' Erik (Eric Bana) with surprise attacks to test her, that she had never heard music for herself, and that she is all of 16 years of age One day Hanna tells Erik that ""I am ready"", and a signal is sent to the authorities that sets in chain an elaborate and deadly chain of events. The next day Erik sets off to places unknown to all but he and Hanna, and Hanna stays alone in the cabin.That night the cabin is descended on by an extremely heavily armed and well trained team of soldiers and Hanna is taken away for testing and questioning. She asks but one question ""I want to see Marissa Wiegler"" (Cate Blanchett – channelling Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard – only with an aurally painful US accent). The brief meeting set up as a result of the request ends with Hanna performing a practically impossible escape, eluding dozens of trained security personnel and such.It is not fair to the film to go into much more detail, but I can say that Hanna finds herself in a foreign land, alone, with no support and a seriously testing journey ahead of her. She is especially taken by a fluorescent light in Morocco, something previously only imagined, and TV proves to be frankly too much to take – where reality TV is concerned I wholeheartedly agree. Erik too is on the move, and Marissa and a small but dangerous team including a flamboyant gay man and two shaven headed neo-Nazis are also in pursuit.Hanna finds unexpected transport and support in the form of a free thinking family (I would call them annoying hippies myself), and she instantly bonds with the precocious and outspoken teenage daughter (if I was the father of this girl I would think it better if Hanna never left the hut surrounded by ice).I really enjoyed the first half of the film, nothing is spelt out to the viewer and a solid foundation is built which suggests the second half should end perhaps better than it does.The action sequences that punctuate the second half of the film are generally short and sharp, but pretty effective, even if they are backed at all times by what I would refer to as watered down techno music. (I subsequently found out the score was done by The Chemical Brothers disappointing.) It is as if at one point the filmmakers thought 'that's enough, let's tell 'em' and the entire plot unfolded over a span of minutes in a finale that was as brief as it was implausible – and it was quite brief.Again I liked Hanna for the most part, the better stretches are essentially a more credible version of Salt, the problem is that the latter stages are almost exactly the same as Salt.This isn't the end of the world, it's just that it could have been much better.Final Rating – 5.5 / 10. A solid foundation is left wanting once credibility and reality is to be replaced with formulaic thrills and spills, leaving us with Hanna (Montana) Salt.",Hanna
74,napierslogs,"Strong female independence, real action, and impressive filmmaking in ""Hanna""",9,9 April 2011,"In her words, Hanna is trained to be independent. In our words, Hanna is trained to be something like a super killer. Wild animals, humans, it doesn't matter. She knows all the techniques. With intense action, character development, and inventive filmmaking, ""Hanna"" is super cool.Like a lot of recent action movies, ""Hanna"" centres on a teenage girl. Unlike all of them, ""Hanna"" is actually good. There is a real sense of reality to the spirit of the film where violence is mixed with an artistic visual and musical score. ""Hanna"" is completely out of this world, and yet well grounded, and that's what makes it great.And did I mention that Hanna is just a girl? She's a smart girl, she's resourceful, alert, and inquisitive. The type of girl who can survive in the wild but perhaps not in the real world of teenage girls. The world that is filled with pop star fascination, sparkly clothes and makeup, and boys who want to kiss you. Luckily though, Hanna is very smart and strong.""Hanna"" represents the ultimate in female independence, and finally a successful merging of action and a character-heavy plot into something that almost seems poetic in its expansive telling on the big screen.",Hanna

76,MrGKB,Strong leads holding comic-booky story together...,6,25 January 2012,"...keeps ""Hanna"" from descending into the ranks of forgettable, while failing to elevate it into the pantheon of truly memorable cinema. Saoirse ""The Lovely Bones"" Ronan plays Hanna, a genetically-engineered fledgling super-soldier who has been lovingly trained by her adoptive father (Eric ""Hulk"" Bana) for vengeance against a stone-hearted CIA boss (Cate ""Lord of the Rings"" Blanchett). This simple tale suffers its fair share of ""Say whats?"" and ""Oh, c'mons,"" but Ronan's performance sells the silly business well, as do those of Bana and Blanchett, along with a fine supporting cast that includes the inimitable Jason ""X-Men: First Class"" Flemyng, Olivia ""Peter Pan"" Williams, winning newcomer Jessica ""Coronation Street"" Barden, and a sublimely creepy Tom ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" Hollander. Alwin ""Sunshine"" Kuchler does the DP chores with sufficient finesse to enable Joe ""Pride & Prejudice"" Wright's direction to tell a story outside his established comfort zone; I applaud them both. Wright handles actors, particularly females, extremely well, letting them transcend the various absurdities of the script.

The plot surrounding a modified human with increased killing and fighting ability going on the run from powerful, and quite evil agencies does sound very Hitmanish, but where as Hit-man was a dull misfire that wanted to cash in on the success of the Transporter movies, this does have some nice touches here and there. Ronan has a unique on-screen presence, plus she's helped by more than decent support, and there's some nice location work, but the script just isn't strong enough, there's no real stand-out moments, and by the end it's just a seen it all before time passer.

79,KnightsofNi11,Stylistic action flick that's far better than average,8,14 October 2011,"We may have found the hidden gem of 2011. This is a movie that was moderately well received upon initial release, but quickly faded into obscurity, and it probably won't show back up during awards season. However, it is a fantastic film. Saorise Ronan plays the title character, Hanna, a young girl who lives with her father Erik, played by Eric Bana, in a hut in the woods in complete isolation. He is training her to become a ruthless assassin for ambiguous reasons. When she is dispatched on a mission across Europe she remains on the run from vicious agents chasing after her for reasons unbeknownst to the audience. It's a film that takes pride in its ambiguity until it all comes together at the end for an explosive climax that rounds out an all around excellent film.Hanna is a flick that could have easily come together as a lackluster and underwhelming action flick that brought absolutely nothing new to the table. But instead it sets itself apart from typical action fare with its unique storyline and fast paced, techno driven style. It is a style that is appropriately European with its unique synthetic beats and its flashy, jumpy, and mechanical style. It's a movie brimming with energy and electricity, never letting its foot off the gas and never taking useless detours. It keeps a steadfast pace with its driving action and its consistently high octane style.At first Hanna seems like a film that chooses style over substance. But as the film goes on its uniqueness from a plot standpoints grows stronger and stronger. I already mentioned the enthralling ambiguity of the film, as it is one of those that throws us into the middle of the action with a back story that we have to piece together as the film progresses, unlocking more and more clues. It's a little difficult to get into the film at first because of its lack of initial explanation and its odd style, but as the film pieces itself together it becomes a highly worthwhile experience. It exercises an excellent blend of style and substance, substance often taking the lead, but never to the extent that the film's story is left in the dust. It's very smart and very sophisticated filmmaking that has to be watched to be appreciated.If you missed Hanna when it was released early in the year then I highly suggest you go back and give it a watch. It's one of the finer films to come out this year, and it delivers a uniqueness that we don't get enough of in strictly action films. At heart Hanna is just a fun action film, but there is enough undercurrent of excellent storytelling to make it a film of much higher quality than your formula action flick.",Hanna
80,cultfilmfan,Hanna,10,17 April 2011,"Hanna is one of those movies, which I have talked about before, where when there is as little said about the film as possible, the better your movie going experience of it will be, so I will try to be brief with the synopsis for the film. Basically it focuses on a father named Erik, who lives out in the wilderness with his teenage daughter Hanna. Erik has taught Hanna how to kill, protect herself and basically adapt and survive in a number of different situations that might come up. This training proves to be very helpful as soon Hanna and Erik are on the run from a secret agency and are both stranded from one another. Hanna is now, or at least for the moment, on her own and it's up to the hunting, rationalizing, fighting, protection and adaptation skills she learned from her father to protect herself and survive on her own and get to her next destination. Hanna is one of those movies that I did not expect to be this good and then after I watched the film, I came out of the theatre absolutely in love with what I just saw. The film works in so many different ways and succeeds and excels in all those ways. Basically what the director and writers have done here is taken a story that in the wrong hands could have been a big budget, loud, overly complicated film with long and over the top action scenes and then making it appeal to your average movie goer who likes those types of films, but leaving everyone else with a rather tedious and bland movie going experience. Hanna takes the formula and borrows from a lot of action films, but it does not try to copy them, but instead tries to make it new and fresh. Instead of a really fast paced and violent film, Hanna takes it's time building up suspense, atmosphere and the characters, so that we can fully appreciate everything later. Although there is a lot to take in and absorb at first to understand these characters and the basic situation they are in, Hanna is not a confusing, or ambiguous film, nor is it slow moving either. The film has a really good pace and what makes it so interesting is not the action scenes, or even the more thrilling chase sequences, but rather the characters, or should I say character itself because the film mostly does focus on Hanna and she is very interesting to watch. The interesting thing about her is how we soon start to place things together and understand her past and why she is in the situation she is in. Also just her personality of being quite cautious of a lot of things for her own safety, but at the same time wanting to reach out to others and form friendships and ultimately understand herself and the world she lives in better. The whole aspect of her survival skills and being able to protect and react correctly in different situations is also quite fascinating with the whole learn to survive with what you have around you theory and it makes for some very intriguing and interesting ideas. The film is very artsy looking with some beautiful cinematography and a very neat visual style as well as original score. The film feels as if it's some art house European film that you are watching because it is so conscious of showing the environment, character development and personality of these characters, but doing it in a way that feels fresh and original. This is a director and group of screenwriters who are definitely trying to bring something new and original to audiences. Something they have not seen before and that they can appreciate. Hanna will not only appeal and work for the average entertainment seeking movie goer, but also people who crave more intellectually driven character films with more visual flair and style than your usual Hollywood fare. I am so glad that this film was picked up for distribution and given a wide release. It was really a new and exciting movie going experience and I was so glad to be a part of it. The film should be applauded for it's direction, screenwriters, actors, cinematographer and musical score. All of them come together to give us a totally new and fresh experience and I loved every minute of it and I highly recommend Hanna to people who usually love these type of films and those who usually hate them because for once both sides will agree on how good and special it really is. One of the best films of 2011.",Hanna
81,carbuff,"Not the quite same old thing, but let down a bit by the ending.",6,29 September 2019,"This is a different and odd movie from the very beginning, although fundamentally it uses a lot of plot elements that date well back in literature and movies. I liked it right away, and I would have given it either 9 or 10 stars except that the ending of the film frittered away some of my goodwill. I'm sure that if I really think about it, the plot has tons of holes, but the action keeps moving and does an outstanding job of persuading one to suspend disbelief. It appears that it's trying to set-up some sort of ""Jason Bourne"" type of franchise, but since it hasn't been followed by a sequel, that doesn't seem to have worked. In any event, ""Hanna"" is a long ways from being an Oscar contender; however, it's a different-enough, lower-key, but still plenty violent action/thriller and worth watching for a fan of the genre who is getting tired of nearly exactly the same old, same old.",Hanna
82,FilmMan47,Good Cinematography But This Is Some Serious Garbage,3,18 April 2015,what in the blue hell did i just saw i caught this on the TV at HBO channel this morning i started to watch it for about 20 minutes in then i had to go for work later i rented this movie decided to check it out only because two of my favorite actors where here Eric Banna & Cate Blanchett were in it and boy what a waste of time and money this was if anyone still has this rented i am warning you please return the disc and get a refund.first of all i wont blame the Jason Bourne for this why because it ain't his fault if other movies start to ape him and this is coming from a die hard Matt Damon fan yes the real bad-ass Jason Bourne the world aped him even the rest bond films became nonsense because of it so why blame that trilogy i mean where is the originality the Bourne films worked because they came at the right time and were quite ahead of its time i don't get it why the world started making these agent films even in comedy people ape it and fail hard.the case with Hanna is similar its a character genetically created the concept is not new for those who know who Agent 47 is they need no introduction with hit-man series.i saw Roger Ebert's review & no doubt about it why he liked crappy movies OK lets say Hanna is a better movie but why everyone hates man of steel 2013 which i have enjoyed much more then this nonsense.just what is wrong with filmmakers these days why are they bent on showing kids as assassins we have already much trouble in the world and they make this kind of crap.you know what guys there is the total hypocrisy of MPAA and all of the censor boards across the world they say movies are violent specially when older men are shooting at each other & suddenly they allow kids using guns killing people one fine example the entire IMDb will agree with me the name is John Woo oh yes anyone who has seen the first film he made called Hard Target 1993 one of the most violent film ever made in Hollywood the theatrical version is edited therefore allots of blood & action missing but in Hanna oh la la animal abuse unnecessary action.the plot:Marrissa Wiegler is tracking a most ruthless assassin girl name Hanna who is only 16 years old raised by her father Eric heller.the cast:just what was sir Eric Banna doing here i love him he is my most favorite actor he is the only guy worth watching here i felt sad for him he should avoid signing movies like these & Cate Blanchett my god she is beautiful what have these people done to her she got wasted so bad here forget method acting Cate is beyond better then that sad to see such a high level caliber actress of our times reading the most awful dialogs ever in history now Saoirse Ronan did great acting as Hanna but more then a assassin she looked like a model in a music video the director never saw any good films in his life tried to convert her into a female john Rambo but like i sad she looks good and way better then hit girl character played by Chole Grace Mortez in kick-ass movie.so what weather Hanna is a clone or super girl or whatever the point is why did the father wanted her to make her a killer too he could have made her a spy or a master of disguise so she could avoid assassination but more then that a good person for personal ego the agents and the father ruined a girls life.the guy who tried to kiss Hanna almost got his neck and head separated from his body that was one scene i loved but it ended soon.talking about action what action this looks like a video game cut scene from 90s so besides stunning cinematography what is good here i say the cast that's it.i talked about hit-man games before here i would once again say that this reminded me of hit-man 2 silent assassin missions the snow scenes are just like that except there is no castle here with a evil bad guy.i just don't get it why this movie is rated so high on what credibility and merit honestly the climax is laughable villain fails to shoot the protagonist in the head anyone want a good agent films try license to kill 1989 best 007 film ever made or Casino Royale 2006 of Daniel Craig. Overall Hanna 2011 is a mess of a film i wont say its a total waste of time but if you are a fan of these cast members & like good shots of cinematography then go for it my rating is 3/10.,Hanna
83,Danusha_Goska,The Work Ethic of a Teen Girl Assassin,8,24 April 2011,"""Hanna"" is a ruthless, relentless, chase featuring a teen girl assassin. It's violent and suspenseful, fast and cruel. The chase sprawls over travelogue settings in the Arctic Circle, North Africa, and Berlin. It's like the Bourne movies, like Daniel Craig's Bond movies. The difference is, of course, that the hero is not a muscle-bound adult male, but a barely muscled teenage girl, Saorise Ronan. And the focus never waivers from the chase. Hanna gets no love interest.I generally don't go to movies I know are going to be violent and I have walked out of violent films, but I loved ""Hanna"" and kept my eyes open throughout almost all of it. It's not just that Hanna, the assassin, is a girl, and I'm female, too, although that was part of it. ""Hanna"" depicts Hanna as having an admirable work ethic, and as being an underdog. The one thing that separates her from the people she so determinedly wounds, beats, stabs, and kills is that she is just following the pedagogical training of her admirably dedicated, old-school patriarch, Erik (Eric Bana.) Erik raised his girl to know how to read, write, and kill. He did this for a righteous reason. The people Erik trained Hanna to kill are very, very bad people, and the audience wants them dead, as well. The morality and worldview of ""Hanna"" is very much that of the setting of its opening scene: the harsh north. This is Nordic morality, where even if you do the right thing, you may end up dead, anyway. There is no reward. If you don't end up dead, and live on, you live on only to keep fighting in a harsh, unforgiving landscape.Saorise Ronan gives an Oscar-worthy performance as Hanna. She truly inhabits a character whose sole focus is on struggle. She enters every new landscape, from a treeless desert to a hotel room, with the focus of a wild animal: where is the food? Where is something to drink? From what direction will danger come? How will I meet it? Ronan never once slips up, never once behaves as a comfortable teenage girl would behave. She has a killer's eyes throughout the entire film. I have to wonder if this wasn't a tough film for her to make. Playing Hanna would have given me nightmares.The film's ruthlessness becomes a bit of a failing. The film is so ready to wound and kill characters the audience wants to like, so ready to turn sweet moments into deadly poison, so ready to let any landscape become a death trap, that I did get a bit jaded about 75% into the film. I was no longer surprised when a character showed some humanity only to be dispatched in the most hateful of ways. But the film threw some new plot developments in at that point, and it kept my interest.Cate Blanchett is terrific as Hanna's foil. Eric Bana is solid as her dedicated teacher and father. The supporting cast, including Tom Hollander and Olivia Williams, is all very good.The Chemical Brothers' soundtrack is perfect. I often don't even hear soundtracks the first time I watch a movie, and when I do notice them, it is, all too often, because they are intrusive and trying to do the work of wrenching emotions that poor filmmaking could not do. During one breathless scene in ""Hanna,"" I realized that the post-Apocalyptic soundtrack geared me up and made me tense and brought me into the scene in a very enjoyable way.",Hanna
84,ajs-10,Good without being great... Still worth a look though...,7,4 March 2012,"Really well made with some excellent fight scenes and action sequences; hats off to the stunt guys (& gals). I thought all the performances were very good, although I do have to single out Cate Blanchett as Marissa; she played the cold-hearted baddie very well indeed.Although I quite enjoyed this film I felt it suffered, as many do these days, from the target audience it was aimed at and hence it's certification. To tell this story with any conviction, I believe, a much tougher edge needed to be given to it. However, it did what it said on the tin and I cannot knock it for that. One thing I did like, amongst others, was the fact that the narrative did not fall into the trap of being so predictable that it became a chore to watch. Over all, quite enjoyable without being great Even so Recommended.My score: 6.8/10.IMDb Score: 6.9/10 (based on 68,330 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 71/100 (based on 203 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 66/100 (based on 60,901 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",Hanna
85,Rob-O-Cop,"Stylised Cartoon Fluff, but enjoyable",6,14 June 2011,"I didn't know quite what to expect going into this. It was an enjoyable visual romp but at the end of the day it had me questioning what it was all about, and I think it was really about much at all. The story an plot can be summed up in a couple of lines and it doesn't deviate much from that. Throw in some quirky character traits and impressive locations, a terrible (possibly on purpose, who can tell) American accent from Blanchett, and before you know it you're at the end of the movie, enjoyably so but somewhat unmoved by what you've just seen, and I'm uncertain if that's a good or a bad thing. Not the deepest movie I've seen by a long shot but it looked good. Best not to think about it too much.",Hanna
86,jrarichards,"Slick, stylish, eccentric, implausible thriller",7,11 January 2016,"A film that starts with beautifully-filmed scenes of Arctic foxes and whooper swans in the Far North, but also encompasses the Moroccan desert and Berlin sounds a bit like it might have pretensions to be a Bond movie, and there are certain similarities in this gritty spy thriller. Saoirse Ronan proved fun and interesting to watch in Kevin Macdonald's ""How I live Now"" (2013), and was handled very effectively by Joe Wright in ""Atonement"" (2007), so this Wright-Ronan collaboration released in 2011 comes somewhere in the middle of these two. Given that she is up against Cate Blanchett as an awful CIA agent, and Eric Bana as a slightly less awful ex-CIA agent (and we know that once you're in you're always in), Ronan dominates the film to an impressive degree. Hence, if this effort is worth watching at all, it is primarily for her, but also - ironically - for her, shall we say, ""socially inexperienced"" character's genuinely fascinating interactions with bit-part players (albeit of the calibre of Olivia Wilde, Jessica Barden, Jason Flemyng and Michelle Dockery) that come in and out of the main (actually far less intriguing) plot. A first romantic encounter with a Spanish boy, an exchange with a Moroccan hotel-owner and repeated interactions with an ever-so-trendy (but actually rather posh) family of British holidaymakers are all pleasures of this film more than a little reminiscent of the tangential meet-ups traditionally present in the films of old like, say, ""The Lady Vanishes"". Sadly, as indicated, the main story is far less interesting (leaving aside the huge difficulties with actually accepting it), and all the more so given a very high body count that (with a few exceptions) leaves the viewer largely unmoved. Ultimately, there are no shortage of weirdish thrillers out there (if few that portray the CIA in such a very bad light), so the reasons for giving 111 minutes of one's time to this - if at all - would be Joe Wright's quite impressive feel for film-making, and of course the piece's very promising and talented young star...",Hanna
87,tonypeacock-1,"Disappointing, confusing, messy",5,29 March 2019,"I have given this film approximately 24 hours between watching and passing judgment. My views have not really changed. Im afraid this film didn't cut it for me.Why? It is so unoriginal. A chase thriller that sees a teenage character, Hanna (Saoirse Ronan) on the run across Europe and North Africa from the clutches of the CIA.Why? I was wondering for a good 40 minutes before realising she held some secret that the CIA and in particular agent Marissa Wiegler (Cate Blanchett) wants to keep secret/eliminate.The film begins with Hanna being brought up in the woods by Erik Hella (Eric Bana) that evoked memories of Leave No Trace. Hanna is being taught almost encyclopedic in foreign languages, the virtues of music and self defence techniques.It appears that the pair are evading the clutches of the CIA but have a transponder that can alert the CIA to their precise location....why?What follows is a Chemical Brothers inspired soundtrack of chase sequences and high violent combat scenes tagged on with Hanna hitching a ride with some weird English campers?
The action sequences are competent but completely confusing.That's what this film is. A tad confusing.
I later learned there was a television series based on the story.
Avoid.",Hanna
88,JohnRayPeterson,Faultless production. I was captivated.,8,25 August 2011,"In the first minute of the movie, while the opening credits unfold then fade, it is clear to the viewer that the cinematographic attention to details and sharp editing is worthy of high praise, leaving you to wonder if the direction, acting and story can possibly be as good and last for the rest of the movie. Two minutes into the movie, a second before the title fills the screen I was already convinced the directions stood a pretty good chance to be just that. Looking at the director's previous four movie releases, one could be confident betting it would be; I can tell you now it is. Saoirse Ronan, who plays Hanna, impressed me; not the first time either, as you may have noticed in my reviews of her previous movies 'The Way Back' as well as in 'The Lovely Bones'. She is the lead actor here, make no mistake about that, but Eric Bana and Cate Blanchett, accomplished and most bankable performers, deliver no less than the lead. I never mentioned or given credit to the make-up or stylist professionals before but will here; Hanna's character gets close-ups one after another and she devours the screen with mesmerising beauty, not her morning look if you had a glance at her pics gallery.The actions scenes will leave those who need that kind of fix, not wanting in this department; it is a vivid thriller in many ways. The pace of the movie has you on the edge of your seat one moment but gives you a chance to pause a little before gradually bringing you back on the edge just as smart directors can do. When I checked the rating at my customary sources, I was a little surprised to see just a fairly good result. I had to give it some thought, read a few other reviews and concluded that the underlying story was a theme everyone has seen and or read before. So that element of the whole package is the weak point; it's not to say it is a crummy story, absolutely not, just 'déjà-vu', and that's all it takes to spoil an otherwise faultless production. Watch the movie if you want to know what that underlying theme is; and if you already guessed it from the IMDb storyline or other sites synopsis, good for you. Genetically enhanced human, ring a bell? Darn, I gave it away.",Hanna
89,Christian_Dimartino,"One of the year's strangest, and one of the year's best.",10,18 October 2011,"I haven't loved many movies in 2011. I have really liked a lot, but there have only been about five that I found excellent. And director Joe Wright's(Atonement) latest film, Hanna, is one of those films.Saoirse Ronan, one of the best young actresses there is,reunites with Wright once again. As if their first film(Atonement, which got her an Oscar nomination), wasn't good enough, they have come back with another perfect movie.Ronan plays Hanna, a girl who has never been into the outside world. Her and her father(Eric Bana)live out in seclusion. Until the C.I.A. track him down. He goes on the run, and Hanna is captured.But that doesn't last long. Because Hanna is a trained killing machine. In the meantime, an agent(played by Cate Blanchett, giving a strange redneck accent), is trying to track her down, for reasons I can't spoil.Wright has never done an action movie, or a movie that isn't based on a novel. But he has a gift for it. The action and chase sequences are extremely well shot, and thrilling too. The score by The Chemical Brothers is awesome, and definitely fits the film.There are a lot of strange moments here, and the plot itself is strange. But I like a little strange activity in a film. Ronan really pulls the film together though. She is part of what made Atonement such a marvelous film, even though she wasn't in it the whole time. I hope that for Wright's next film he goes for something along these lines... and not The Soloist. Overall, Hanna is Salt's niece, but a lot smarter. But I like that movie too. But this is one of the years best.A-",Hanna
90,bopdog,"""Kick-Ass"" meets ""Run Lola Run"" meets ""Boys From Brazil."" I liked it!",7,9 April 2011,"Should repeat: MAJOR SPOILERS!!!I enjoyed this movie. It had a sensibility that isn't too common. Reminded me of the recent, great ""Kick Ass."" But it was in no way a remake or a rip-off of Kick Ass. The obvious similarities are a young girl raised by a single, doting father to be a lethal assassin. Beyond that ""Hanna"" provides different motivation for the characters and the story.As a thriller it really works well. It is firmly grounded in a plausible plot with the CIA having created, then abandoning, a genetic modification program to raise a crop of super soldiers (that's the ""Boys From Brazil"" part). Whether you buy into such conspiracies being true to real life or not- such a premise does seem to be a reliable trope for movies through the years. At least in the fictional world, it is based on plausible and real ""facts."" ""Kick Ass,"" in contrast, while a great movie was nonetheless always a comic book, and always a fantasy.Cate Blanchet, one of my faves, plays a cold, steely character that appears as a villain. Good acting! She was odious. But by the end, with all the reveals, we begin to suspect her character just might be acting with good intentions. Maybe the genetically engineered super soldier shouldn't be allowed to roam free, or even live? Although one cringes at Blanchet's methods for tracking her prey--- they were unacceptably over-the-top ruthless, with much collateral damage. Perhaps a typical audience member's secret wish, by the end, was for the runaway genetic mistake (the girl) to be killed, and then for the sociopathic hunter CIA lady (Blanchet) to be killed as well. Two evils eliminated for the price of one.Funnily- these issues were not raised through the course of the movie. It was only in the last few minutes that the audience got enough info to even ponder such things. Prior to that we were manipulated into thinking the standard spy-chases-innocents ploy was at work. Walking out of the cinema we only then begin to wonder who was really innocent here (certainly not the ""dad,"" not the kid, and not the CIA boss lady)?Good all-round fun. The pace is a driving rock track that feels a bit like ""Run Lola Run,"" without feeling like a rip-off. Exciting!",Hanna
91,gigan-92,Tragic Example of Style Over Substance,5,23 May 2012,"Uh, I suppose I'll start with the few things I liked about this escapade. The score wasn't half-bad, rather intriguing actually. And secondly, nice use of lighting and sets. That playground at the climax was pretty awesome. All generally nice comments end here.First complaint, none of the action was great at all. If you came in expecting something along the lines of the Bourne trilogy, Taken or hell even the sh*twad Salt you'll be letdown by sub-par fight cinematography. Secondly, too much random b.s. came off as a half-assed plot. Why does a scene with Hanna and her new found friend start with a shot of their feet before the camera does this odd, sensual, close-up of the two talking almost nose-to nose? Are these 12 years old girls suppose to kiss? Is there a side love story? Can a little girl really grab and hold onto the bottom of a speeding car? But those are just semi-confusing bits that irked me, my main gripe are the villains: they suck ass. Skin-heads, an out of shape German dude in his morning running clothes and of course Cate Blanchett, whose only threatening moment was a wimpy scene of her shooting an old lady in the back. Her character came off as weak and pathetic compared to the protagonists from the very start, so where's the tension? Nowhere to be found sadly. Honestly the only reason why this film has the rating it does is because people get caught up in the soundtrack.",Hanna

This is dazzling, kinetic filmmaking, with a young woman as a protagonist, young Saoirse Ronan, pitted against a ruthless Cate Blanchett in a plot of some complexity and denseness--but no matter, as the film functions primarily a chase that kept me involved until perhaps at the end, a little too much running about; there are a few absurdities and plot holes which might be explained away in careful examination of whats already happened, but why bother?

95,the-movie-guy,Hand-to-hand combat sequences were done well,4,14 April 2011,"(Synopsis) Hanna (Saoirse Ronan) is a 16-year-old girl living in the wilderness of Finland with her father (Eric Bana), an ex-CIA agent in hiding. Hanna is exceptional in that she has the strength of a man, the stamina of a wolf, and the intelligence of a hunter. Her father has been honing her innate skills her entire life to become the perfect assassin. Hanna is finally sent into the new world on a mission to eliminate her first human target. Hanna's appearance brings her to the attention and focus of intelligence agents who begin hunting her down to stop her before she completes her mission.(My Comments) Reading the synopsis you would think this would be an intriguing storyline. Well, you would be wrong. The movie starts off with a great opener, but it goes downhill fast. The storyline is all over the place. You will not develop any feelings for the characters. It would have been better to let the audience in on the secret earlier so we would understand the plot. Actually, that might not help the writing. Some of the actions that were done in the movie were simply stupid such as letting your target know where you are, and that you are come for her. The only thing that was done well was the hand-to-hand combat sequences. Overall, you can wait for the movie to come on TV and see it for free. (Focus Features, Run Time 1:51, PG-13)(4/10)",Hanna
96,oOoBarracuda,Hanna,6,2 January 2017,"One reason I enjoy planning my film viewing list by coordinating a month's worth of films is the chance to expose myself to films that I would not otherwise see. Hanna, the 2011 film by Joe Wright was one such film. Starring Saoirse Ronan, Eric Bana, and Cate Blanchett, Hanna explores the life of a girl raised by her father with the intention of making her the perfect assassin. Inventive camera-work and an impressive score define Hanna, keeping the audience engaged until the final shot is fired.16-year-old Hanna (Saoirse Ronan) has been solely raised by her father in a remote section of wildlife in Finland. Her father, Erik Heller (Eric Bana) is an ex-C.I.A. agent who has made it his mission to train Hanna to become the perfect assassin. Hanna has never been out of the shack she and her father live in but has been taught to hunt and fight, unlike any other teenager. When her father must leave for a mission, it is up to Hanna to traverse Europe, evade capture by the agents sent out to look for her and get to the pre-destined meeting place unscathed to be reunited with her father. Along the way, Hanna uncovers shocking findings that call to question her very identity.Cate Blanchett is just brilliant in everything she is in. A strong supporting role in Hanna, she is the one that brought the most depth to her character, leaving me thirsting for more scenes she was in as the film unfolded. Saoirse Ronan, on the other hand, came off very one- trick-pony to me, after seeing this film. I may have been handicapped by the fact that I just saw her in Brooklyn for the first time weeks before watching her in Hanna; nonetheless, Ronan seems to give each character the same characterization despite the extreme differences in roles. The standout in Hanna is its score. Creating the perfect tone for the film, the tonal score is brilliant. The camera-work was also a fun treat while watching Hanna. The angles used and the disorienting shots lend themselves well to full-immersion into Hanna's life that would have otherwise been missing. The disjointed plot was a bit rougher in some places than others, but there is enough pulling Hanna together that makes it a good way to spend a couple hours.",Hanna

I expected more than I got. It was good at first the set up with Hanna and her father; the bad lady chasing them. It was the usual super human person escaping harm through their strength and wits. I enjoyed the part when Hanna reaches the real world and the time she spends with regular people, especially a normal, annoying English teenager and her free spirit mother. But then the film deteriorates into one chase scene after another; one scene of stylized violence after another. After so much chasing and so much killing the ending becomes anti-climatic. 5/10",Hanna

103,socrates99,There's considerable talent and imagination on display here,9,9 April 2011,"I'm a little leery about portrayals of girls, or women for that matter, as martial arts experts. There's a reason boxing is divided into weight classes: larger and more muscled individuals have an unfair advantage, which is to say, people who are smaller and lighter have an almost insurmountable disadvantage in a fight. No amount of imagination is going to change that. Therefore there's something a bit perverse in our continuing obsession with women as skilled warriors and killers. Why do we want young women to believe they have any chance in a fight against a well-trained man? The only real equalizer in today's world is a firearm.That said, this movie is not trying to be realistic though there are a few nods toward plausible explanations. Instead it takes the idea of revenge and creates one of the longest and most artful expressions of that idea I've ever seen. Some of the early scenes in particular are achingly exquisite and a marvel to watch. They really made me wonder how this film could have been sold to investors without a lot of artistry on their part. Somehow, the protagonist, Hannah, is shown to be convincingly new to the modern world, and we feel her first experiences along with her. No doubt a lot of the credit should go to Ms Ronan who has quite a firm grasp on the film's intent. But the director's contributions are even more important. Mr Wright is masterful in a way that is reminiscent of Christopher Nolan's Inception, but more facile and, I think, powerful. That's quite an accomplishment since Nolan's plot was considerably better, the one shortcoming here. Eric Bana and Cate Blanchett make their usual skilled contributions to the project but this is essentially one long and beautiful dream sequence, and it's Mr Wright in total control and focused on Ms Ronan. It works very well and it really shouldn't be missed as it's quite different and better than most action films.",Hanna
104,markgorman,More chases than the Cheltenham Festival...,6,25 May 2011,"I thought Joe Wright's direction of Atonement was outstanding and the performance by Saoirse Ronan was delightful (how on earth do you pronounce that name?) and so I thought their reconciliation under an entirely new genre would be more than interesting. And in parts it is.The first 30 minutes is intriguing, hard to unravel but with enough clues to reel you in. It transpires that Ronan and her ""father"" Erik (played acceptably by Eric Bana) are some Arctic based super hit squad training for their ""big day"".When Code Red is announced they set of in their separate directions with instructions to meet at a disused (and superbly evocative) Grimm's house in a disused fairground in Berlin that affords ample cinematographic pearls.The early scene where, upon capture, the childlike Ronan kicks some ass and escapes from a high tech ""prison"" in the Morrocan desert is great and you're left thinking a treat is in store.The ridiculously caricatured middle class family that Ronan stumbles upon and drive her from here to eternity add a new dimension and are amusing in parts (especially the daughter played by Jessica Barden) but are just too daft.And whilst there are plenty of moments that grip, and look sublime, the truth is that from reel one to reel two it turns into a really boring chase movie.Glimpses of fabulous scenery and photography grace the banality that follows as it becomes monumentally under-edited and, as a consequence way, way too long.The closing stages drag forever.Oh, and the deer.Give me a break.Cate Blanchett doesn't impress, even with her green shoes.It's OK.No more than that, despite the Chemical Bothers' fab soundtrack.6/10",Hanna
105,dvc5159,Top-notch direction and acting around a screenplay that can be straight out of any typical 1970s assassin drama/thriller,6,21 July 2011,"Upon seeing the population, Hanna finds herself enthralled with the ""new"" world that she has now entered, her eyes filled with amazement and wonder, while earlier in the movie she was in the Arctic wilderness, trained by her father in the isolated forest to hunt and kill for survival, and to defend herself for all costs. A thought hit me: do we take life for granted so much that we completely forgot the basic, simpler things in life? Consider the scene where Hanna opens all of the electronics in the Moroccan inn and finds herself bewildered by the noise - the television, the fan, the water boiler, the flickering lights, all made increasingly frustrating, thanks to expert directing, editing and especially acting by our lead actress. But then again I think too much.Joe Wright's ""Hanna"", an action thriller which marks a change of pace for the usually dramatic filmmaker, is a superbly-crafted thriller, with a top-notch performance by Saoirse Ronan and excellent support by Cate Blanchett and Eric Bana. While the script is admittedly nothing new and could use some touch-ups, Wright directs with confidence and his crew follows him well - the cinematography is beautifully framed (somewhat frantic in a few action sequences), the editing is paced tightly when it needs to, and the music by The Chemical Brothers is good, almost great, and gives a new twist to techno-scores given that techno music in an action movie has become a sort of a cliché.The film has the look and the style of a modern action movie but it feels like a gritty, straightforward thriller that would not be out of place in the '70s. The long, drawn out silence of beautiful scenery is interrupted by a gunshot or an arrow, and yet the music doesn't swell yet. I liked this somewhat minimalist touch.It's a character driven piece, and we have a gifted actress named Saoirse Ronan to thank for that. Her cold, blue eyes in contrast with her sweet, calm face makes for a very complex and somewhat violent character when she takes action. Blanchett enjoys herself as she indulges in the villainous role with a devilish aura around her, and Bana provides tough yet ambiguous support for the young assassin.Now a lot of people are complaining about the plot, about it being filled with plot holes and all, and some unfinished business. Now although I don't think this film is going to win any Oscars (save for the cinematography) I'd have to agree that there were parts that left me in the blank. But then again, the story is about as direct and a bullet, and when it starts, it starts. When it ends, it ends. Finished. No cheap scares, no dragged-out pointless conversations, and no extended aftermath/ending. I like those. And although the story is finished at the end, some of the motives of the characters remain unresolved. I guess maybe that's the way it should be.Is this film an Oscar contender? I highly doubt it. But is it a great film? No. But as a pure action thriller, it's very good. A dollop of old-school mixed in with the new-school film-making. It's extremely entertaining if you're in the right mood and don't take it too seriously. And it confirms my belief that Saoirse Ronan is among the most talented young actresses out there today. Problematic plot or not, the film's expert craftsmanship around it highly overcomes it flaws and may very well make it one of the year's best films.P.S. The one-take scene which starts when Bana walks out of the bus and into the subway station fight is an extremely well-shot and carefully directed scene that deserves mention.Overall rating: 76/100",Hanna
106,Rockwell_Cronenberg,Doesn't miss a beat.,8,6 June 2011,"Duncan Jones did it with Source Code and now Joe Wright has given us another dose with Hanna. 2011 has given us a fresh new treat, taking directors with power for emotional heft and intellectual stimulation and putting them at the helm of what could have been standard popcorn fare. As a result, we now have two wild adrenaline rushes that also manage to hit us in the heart and mind. After an unfortunate slip-up with 2009's The Soloist, Joe Wright really returns to form here with a film that is exciting from the start to the end, with a healthy amount of emotional strength thrown in. For the most part the film is just a badass action flick, making an unlikely action star out of Saoirse Ronan, but it also goes through phases of being a fantastic character study and in the final act goes to some pretty damn emotional places.The ultimate star of the film is Joe Wright, but everyone contributes a large amount of talent here. The cast is all-around brilliant. Ronan delivers her best performance yet, which is quite the compliment for a girl who has already given two knockout portrayals in her career. Her role as the titular character lets her do a lot and she nails every aspect of the young girl. She can be brutal and vicious in her action scenes, then contrast it beautifully with that wide-eyed curiosity and naiveté of a girl discovering the world for the very first time. It's a coming-of-age tale in a very odd way and Ronan was the perfect choice for the role. Acting-wise the film belongs to her, but the supporting cast isn't shabby either. Eric Bana is dead on as the strong father of the girl, convincing in his action scenes and quietly heartfelt in his more emotional moments with Ronan. Cate Blanchett has proved before that she can be a great villain in a pretty terrible film, but here she gets the chance to shine in a great one, getting a wonderfully hammy role that she nails. She's chilling, weak while putting on a strong face and makes you hate her but always want to see more. Tom Hollander steals all of his scenes as a real slimy, disgusting villain, whispering a tune that will give you chills whenever you hear it. Everyone in the cast is fantastic, starting at the top with Ronan and going all the way down.Hanna's script, by Seth Lochhead and David Farr, had been on the annual Hollywood Black List for a few years and it's no surprise why now that it's finally on screen. What could have been a pretty riveting action tale ends up having so much character depth along with that emotional gravitas and intelligence, without getting too bogged down in any one aspect of it. There's a perfect balance, an action scene matched by a great moment of Hanna becoming an adult matched by a great moment of intrigue into her past. I have to say that my favorite aspect of the film's got to be everything with Hanna discovering the world. This young girl spending her entire life in the woods is now grown up and finally introduced to the world. It could have been really easy to skimp on this aspect of the character, but Lochhead and Farr spend just the right amount of attention on it. They give us these scenes of her being excited and terrified by the world she never knew, matched by Ronan's incredible performance, but they don't bog down the film with it. They know most of all that it's this revenge flick that needs loads of action and they don't spend too much time dragging out that coming-of-age story. It's just right.Even in The Soloist, a film with very few positive aspects, Wright and his crew managed to make a pretty outstanding technical achievement, as he did with Pride & Prejudice and Atonement. Well, his fourth film is no different and it's certainly his most diverse and vast production. There are more locales here than a James Bond film and the set and costume design are absolutely breathtaking. From a labyrinthine holding facility in Morocco to the final confrontation at a Grimm amusement park, every set is a feast for the eyes and could have stolen the film away if everything else wasn't just as remarkable. The score by The Chemical Brothers came on a little strong it's first scene, but once it got comfortable, it became this kinetic spark that built up that energy that was already driven into the intense action sequences. It makes all of the action scenes even more exciting, and never steals attention away from the more dramatic moments.After falling in love with his first two pictures, I had no problem calling Joe Wright one of the most exciting directors working today. He took a severe drop with The Soloist, but with Hanna the man proves that he can do more than just period pictures. He takes a very modern approach to a very modern tale and creates an action film that's as much about it's characters as it's violence. The film is shocking, chilling, emotional, intense and absolutely intriguing. I was always on the edge of my seat and my mind was always racing, all culminating into some emotional moments in that final act. The relationship between Hanna and her father is played very well, and her departure from him through the majority of the film is definitely it's finest aspect. This is a film where not a single beat is missed, not a single scene feels like fluff and everything ends up in the right place. I enjoyed it thoroughly, there wasn't an ounce of me that was disappointed. Love it.",Hanna
107,Cinema_Fan,"Same old same old, with a difference.",6,14 May 2011,"I thought this movie had a lot of promise to begin with and the concept of a young girl holding her own in the fields of battle looked, again, promising, and the beautiful and charming cinematography gave the film and its look a distinct charm of individuality.Act one seemed to be heading off in at least one direction, that was until she had smuggled herself onto the Spanish mainland and from this moment onward the film falls flat and turns itself into a standard, mediocre, but still, at times, beautifully shot movie.The mood and texture of this film, the second act, is a decaying inner urban city feel and look but the weakest point here is its drive and direction of exactly where we, as an audience, and the films narrative are heading. The second act follows this young child into the unknown and it is here that the film falters in so much as its narrative is then turned into one, long continuous drama of chase, hunt and hunted.While its soundtrack does its best to emphasise the girls surroundings, see Children of Men (2006) to get the exact feel here too, it is only let down by is perpetual scenario of this go nowhere plot. The first act only brings you up to be unexpectedly dropped down to earth again, with a bang of disappointment and predictability, to the point of unclosed predictions leading to too many unanswered questions. This all feels rather weak and lacking in any depth and form to carry the next scene along.Saoirse Ronan shines and plays the girl who knows life's knowledge and too knows nothing of life's experience is the only true individual here while the rest of her companions are given clichéd roles that, sadly, toward the end give off a clichéd setting and conclusion. The characters are exciting, are menacing and deadly, the settings and locations are interesting and brooding and the soundtrack has that urban feel about it, giving the film its edge, but, this young child, Hanna, is only let down by the long and open road of closed-off writing and an unchallenging second act. It is all too unfair for this young victim of deadly pursuits and it feels, toward its end, all too familiar.",Hanna
108,Jackpollins,I was bored,2,28 April 2011,"Saoirse Ronan is a good actress...a really good actress. Kids who can kill people in movies are awesome if done right (just look at Hit-Girl). That being said, Saoirse Ronan playing a kid who can kill people was, well, to put it nicely, the biggest letdown in years. It's a sad day in movies when I can say the only good thing in a movie is the score by The Chemical Brothers. Going in, I was expected a smart action-revenge-thriller, but what I got was a movie that obviously did not have a lot of thought going into it. It's a mess in which Saoirse Ronan tries to attempt a Hit Girl meets James Bond character but it just ends up being a film about a dull meets duller character. Hanna never leaves the ground. It just stays there hoping you will be entertained by both mindless violence and mindless dialogue (both of which I was entertained by in many movies.) Even though I was entertained by both of these things in many movies, I wasn't in Hanna. The reason for this being that it just wasn't done well enough in Hanna. The talented performers Cate Blanchett and Eric Bana are also in it, but they're wasted as characters that don't really get their chance to shine. Hanna may leave a lot thinking it was quote on quote ""cool"", but I was bored, and if you have a mind for movies, or that matter, a mind for anything smart, you'll be bored, too.",Hanna
109,Meven_Stoffat,Best movie of the year so far,10,22 April 2011,"I'll admit I didn't know what to expect from Hanna before going in. I had only seen the trailer once and barely remembered what was shown. And, I saw this in the D-BOX section of the screening room, which means motion seats. I'd figured this movie was pretty exciting if it was gonna be shown in D-box.And, as a result, it was. This is definitely the best movie to be released so far this year. There's a lot of garbage floating out there like ""Your Highness"" and ""Red Riding Hood"". Finally, a movie that is equally as thought-provoking as it is action packed and thrilling.Hanna is a 14 year old girl, an assassin since a child. She lives with her father, Erik, in a hut in the woods, who has trained her to be an assassin, and has kept her in the woods from day one, after the murder of the mother. As the film starts, ""the time is right""- Hanna is ready to see the outside world, and so Erik sends her on a mission to meet him in Berlin... and to help successfully get revenge on Marissa, an American intelligence agent bent on killing both Hanna and Erik.And that's all you need to know- because Hanna is a high-octane, gripping, and totally action-packed movie that, the less you knew about, the more you will enjoy it.Saoirse Ronan is just insanely amazing as the titular character. I'll be honest, I liked her more than Chloe Moertz in Kick-Ass. I was not surprised to find out she did most of the action herself, because I swear, it was just a thrill to watch. Cate Blanchett is stunning, hilarious, and sexy in her role as Marissa- and her southern drawl is great!!!! I actually thought she did a fantastic job. But, the real show-stealer is Eric Bana. He was a total badass, his performance was just fantastic and he seemed really into it.In addition, the cinematography is great too. Gorgeous scenery and good camera work in the action scenes too- even the rather gimmicky upside down shots were great. The suspense is high throughout, there's a LOT of suspense, and the last 20 minutes are an intense nail biter, especially the twist ending.Oh, and in addition, if this is playing in a D-box theatre near you, see it. The motion seats just add to the intensity of the film.In short, do not miss this intense experience. It is by far the best movie to be released in 2011, and there is not a single dull moment!",Hanna
110,jose-cruz53,Highly entertaining,7,26 October 2012,"I like films featuring young girls killing enemies several times their weight. Its a sort of guilty pleasure to look at. This film is pretty much that kind of movie: it is the story of a look-like-12 year old girl who is trying to find her dad and kills everything in her path to do so. Its competently made and has some very well constructed action scenes, though, sometimes it is apparent that the actors are throwing themselves around when they pretend to be overpowered by a 12 year old girl.Recommended to those that like films featuring little girls kicking the asses of guys who look like heavy boxers. Those that like a minimum degree of realism, shy away.",Hanna
111,Ryan_MYeah,"Sleek, thrilling, and superbly acted.",7,30 August 2011,"My verdict is Hanna is a sleek, solid action thriller.Saoirse Ronan plays the title character, a young girl put under years of extensive training by her assassin father (Played by Eric Bana). Having been given an immense encyclopedic knowledge, a wide array of weaponry training, and a deadly range of various combat styles, she takes on a mission for her father: To make her presence known to a CIA agent (Played by Cate Blanchett) with ties to her father's past, and exact revenge. ""Adapt or die"" as Hanna puts it.First off, this is a major departure for Joe Wright's usual directorial style. Wright is best known for his period pieces such as Atonement and Pride and Prejudice, both my favorite movies of their years. So I'm kind of alarmed by this route he's taken, but also quite amazed. He concocts an even pace for the film, brings what he can out of the screenplay (Except for that which even he can't make the utmost sense of), and crafts it very well.The way he lets the cinematography flow and the editing sparkle is incredibly clever. On the rare occasion, the style seems to be a bit overcooked, and I hate to admit that I find the score by The Chemical Brothers to be a forgettable, bludgeoning mess, but that still doesn't seriously deplete the movie's thrilling edge. The action sequences are especially expertly choreographed and staged, especially a cool - sometimes trippy - sequence where Hanna escapes from a prisoner holding cell in full badass style.Now, if you'd have given the lead role to anyone else, they could have overdone the whole thing, or not given it enough depth. Somehow, Saoirse Ronan just finds this sincerity, and sympathetic humanity within a very vicious character. She and the screenwriters put so much effort into Hanna. She's intimidating, she's funny, she's sweet, she's extraordinarily written. She basically checks off each and every box. Eric Bana and Cate Blanchett also shine in their supporting roles, even if their characters are a bit under written.So that's all I've got at the moment, so I'll close by giving Hanna **1/2 out of ****",Hanna
112,doorsscorpywag,Poorly plotted and plodding plop,1,6 June 2011,"Based on the rating one would be forgiven for expecting a film that first made sens and second was actually good. I was looking forward to seeing this but after watching it wish I had not wasted my time. The whole thing was too daft and over convoluted for words. Hanna started in the Arctic, got captured and ended up in Morocco, escaped to Spain and then to Germany. This without the faintest idea what to do with a light switch, telephone or annoying TV programme. But of course she was able to first, find a place with a computer and second, use one proficiently enough to extract information from. Seemed odd she was freaked out by a light switch but knew what a computer was. Also her fighting skills against trained soldiers was stunning but she was not very well trained in warding off skinheads in the employ of a whistling dwarf in a tracksuit. What Cate Blanchett was doing and why was difficult to understand and the plot revelations were never really exploited very well. It had the makings of a good film but was too stupid to actually make the grade. If this was Eric Bana's plan to kill his nemesis it assumed a lot of things would go Hanna's way for her to complete her Mission Impossible. Especially as she was unable to even turn on a light. Her escape was utterly silly and became sillier when she hooked up with the family in the camper van. Very little of the actions of anybody in the film made that much sense and the story made even less. The reviews here written by those who worked for the production team ensure that the film feels worth watching but best start at the hated it and work upwards for a sense of what the film is really like. Another promising movie that failed miserably. Thankfully I saw 'Paul' the same day and that made up for watching Hanna. Hopefully 'Super 8' will be more 'Paul' than 'Hanna'.",Hanna

115,digdog-785-717538,Does NOT do what it says on the tin,1,23 April 2011,"My oh my what a mess.. how *do* you people seriously vote a film like Hanna at 7.8, where do you find the courage to do so.You know, if i go to the shops and grab a tin of beans, i expect there to be beans inside, and if i open that tin and find chicken stew instead, no matter how good the chicken stew is, i would still be upset; maybe i dreamt them, but in my mind, i still recall the trailers of this film and i was under the impression that this was going to be a martial arts-slash-spy story film. I had *really strong* impressions.. that this was going to be a girl's version of Bourne Identity.. seriously. I was convinced this film was going to be fanboy-awesome. Instead, it's a pile of S**t.So, the titular Hanna is a young blonde gorgeous girl who spends her life training somewhere near the arctic circle, trained to become an unstoppable machine of death and a masterful infiltrator. Obviously, her teacher fails so miserably that she doesn't even know what a lightbulb is ffs.. despite being taught about supernovae and whales and - we hope - everything in between.Well, at least the martial arts sections were good .. oh no wait - there aren't any! Hanna very, very rapidly - or not rapidly enough, actually - turns into a coming-of-age chick flick that would not have been out of place on TV in the 80's.. if, and i must stress *if*, they had marketed it this way - with its true contents - then at least i could have avoided it, and i would have; What a ripoff. This film might not be the worse i have ever seen, though it *does* rank up there with the most boring, i should say, but the problem is the same with the tin of beans.. it's not what i wanted, and i want my money back. I can't give Hanna a realistic vote. If i wanted a horror and got a really bad horror, i could vote it down, but this film is nothing of what i was sold; in light of this act of complete thievery,My final vote 1/10 The producers didn't even have the courage to sell it as what it really is.",Hanna
116,theinaniloquent,"""Adapt or die""",9,4 May 2012,"Now say your expecting to watch an action movie. No, your first choice would not be Hanna. I never even heard of the before beforehand. But nevertheless, I wanted to see an action movie. There was tons and tons, but nothing quite matched up to the critical rating of Hanna. And the premise seemed interesting enough. Not too fancy, nothing too overloaded, and come on, it got a 71% on Rotten Tomatoes. So I clicked the add to queue button and clicked play, oblivious to what I was in for. Expecting a contrived action flick that will entertain, not thought-provoke...I came out of the movie itself. Hanna was really an experience. But then I got onto IMDb to see it having a low average. It really saddens me how movies have to be cliché in order to be good. Hanna dismembers these. If this film was directed by, say, Michael Bay, everything would be explosion to explosion, no substance. But Joe Wright gave his everything to this film. The film is filled with substance, action, and a brilliant soundtrack from the Chemical Brothers. So, let's get started, shall we? The movie's acting was surprisingly great. This was the first role I've seen Saoirse Ronan in and she did a brilliant job. I was surprised at how she showed emotion and her delivery was on-time, great, unexpected. She also played the twist of her role well, like she wasn't exactly human after all. Every supporting character did great as well. The movie is a slow-burner. And yet the movie is highly interesting, and has this weird atmosphere you're not sure to escape to stay put. I loved the directing as well, Joe Wright gave the film his twist to the story. It was actually pretty creepy and dark. And the movie knows how to pace itself without going from action scene to action scene. Now this is what the mainstream audience doesn't understand, action does not complete a film. Hanna does have it's share of action, but it doesn't glamorize it. And that reminds me, the action was great! Have you ever seen a movie where the fight scenes are so shaky and close-up to the character's face, you don't even see most of the action? Hanna differs. It was well-choreographed, well-played, and well-designed. It was different. And different is good. I'm not sure to recommend or not. I loved the movie myself, but most of the community here would not enjoy it as much as I did. To closely compare, the movie was an art-house action film. It provided the atmosphere, the action, and the slow-burner pacing. And to visualize it even more, the movie was like a dark fairy tale. It was all done so well and great, you're going to be transfixed in a world like no other. And that's not exactly what people want nowadays. Here, here's a plan. I'll get someone to cut out all the ""boring"" scenes for you and keep all the action scenes. Then know your finalized movie is pure nothing, and I surely hope you enjoy it! I kid, but the movie is surely not for everyone. If you like artsy movies, that succeed at drifting away from being clichéd, this is your kind of movie. It provides everything you could ever dream of. If your a mainstream viewer, who idolizes Michael Bay, then this isn't your type of film. And mainstream viewer, there, I missed your heart..9/10.",Hanna
117,paudie,Thriller or fairytale?,7,9 May 2012,"""Hanna"" isn't the run of the mill thriller I expected but I definitely enjoyed it.At the start of the movie we see 15-year-old Hanna (Saoirse Ronan) and her father (Eric Bana) living off the land in a snowy wilderness. It seems he has taught his daughter every survival technique necessary to survive in such a harsh environment.It also seems that she is being prepared for a particular task and eventually her father leaves her alone to be found by the ""authorities"". However they have made arrangements to meet in Berlin in the near future. He seems very confident that she will be able to make this appointment and that she will be able to perform a particular task in the meantime.Hanna asks to see a particular CIA agent (Cate Blanchett) when she is taken into custody. This agent seems familiar with Hanna and her father. Telling you much more of the story would spoil it.Initially the story follows a straightforward thriller arc but it takes quite a few diversions along the way. It is possible to describe it as the story as being a fairytale of a ""very special"" girl being pursued by an evil witch.The soundtrack by the Chemical Brothers is excellent, particularly in a couple of the action sequences, which are filmed like music videos.Be prepared to be confused along the way but you should enjoy the ride!",Hanna
118,Eddie_weinbauer,Could have been really good.,4,4 June 2017,"The story of Hanna,is something you get dropped right in the middle off,and then have to figure out the background, piece by piece.Eric Bana does and just average job, as her father and mentor. But it doesn't look like he puts much effort in it. There is a lot of dwelling on scenes that really are only ""page fillers"" with no point in them,except to show what Hanna experience at that particular moment. The problem with them, is they dwell to long on them.They are of very little interest to the viewer.Watching 5-10 min. Of gypsy dancing is irrelevant for driving the story forward. And Hanna's expression is the same all the time.So you don't know how she feel about itAs someone else's pointed out you have to shut of your brain and just enjoy. But it get difficult when the movie can't keep the pace. The old JCV movies managed that quite well.You shut of your brain and just watch.But this one is too long,and too flawed.saoirse Ronan could use some more classes in showing emotion with you facial expressions. She unfortunately has a very stone faced expression.******Spoilers**********Spoilers********spoilers*******spoilers** What bother me is the very stereotypical approach to the whole thing. Hannas father(who is an ex secret agent/Assassin) has trained her to be a super assassin.Krav Maga,hunting killing,how to live of the land etc. But have totally failed to train her on social etiquette,and behavior. Which make no sense at all. How are you suppose to blend in when you stick out as a soar thumb. Sure you can't prepare them for everything,when you are just two people in a cabin in the woods.But some basic stuff would be expected.I get the feel the movie changed direction, and background on the characters midway. But all in all it's an OK movie. A bit to long for this type peharps",Hanna
119,pivic,Well-made but with a few flaws,7,8 June 2011,"Call it a ""Nikita"" if you'd like, and just like that film - by Luc Besson - it's made by a person who's very much interested in the visual and contains notable aspects surrounding the lead character. Hanna, raised in the wilderness by her former secret agent father, is honed in everything from languages to hunting animals using bow and arrow. She's a supreme being who's estranged from the outside world and from other people than her dad. As such, the script reaches some levels of stereotypical girl-from-the-wilderness naivety as Hanna discovers the world, e.g. she kicks the pap out of the first boy who tries to kiss her. Even so, this is a quite charming film, mostly due to Saoirse Ronan, lead player, who manages to turn out what could be a drab role to something alive. The action sequences are nice, straightforward pieces without any sentiment. The film as a whole is done without much sentiment, mind you, which is a saving grace. The cinematography is lovely, and goes to show how director Joe Wright's long background in video graphics has helped out with interesting shots; that said, his direction is there for a reason, not to dazzle with effects. Cate Blanchett's acting is a let-down, as she plays with the fervor of a quite dead Judy Dench. Speaking of character, the film doesn't have them. It's not a sprawl of feel, more like emotions riddled throughout. And the soundtrack is sweet, made by The Chemical Brothers. All in all: as an action film with feeling, it's commendable. It doesn't quite reach the soul but is well made.",Hanna
120,PCC0921,Saoirse Ronan makes her presence known.,8,20 September 2020,"This is a sleek, slick, entertaining film about a young woman (Saoirse Ronan), living in the snow-covered woods of Finland, who realizes, her father (Eric Bana, quite well I might add), an ex-CIA man (who has trained her to do combat, self defense and all kinds of killing), is not really her father at all, but a man who rescued her from the lab experiment that created her originally for this assassin lifestyle that the scientists meant for her. She makes a decision to go out into the world on her own, but she faces great danger revolving around a dangerous intelligence officer (Cate Blanchett). Everybody has a secret and that is what comes to light as the movie and the chase moves on.This is a film with a nicely built structure, beautiful cinematography, breath-taking locations and a fantastic editing job highlight some of what makes this film quite good. The film opens and closes almost the same way and there is an interesting angle involving the fact that Hanna has never heard music in her life, but her ""mother"" was a singer. It brings an interesting contrast to the rest of the key elements in the film. The action scenes are stimulating. I only saw a couple of mistakes. It has a wonderful soundtrack and the film is put together real nice. Hanna is a 16 year old kid, who is brought into the world very grown up and it is interesting watching her naivete and her smarts collide together.8.5 (B+ MyGrade) = 8 IMDB",Hanna
121,perkypops,Comparisons with the Bourne trilogy do not do it justice,8,22 March 2012,"The breathtaking opening minutes of Joe Wright's ""Hanna"" leave this film with a mountain to climb to keep up the good work, and that it partially succeeds in maintaining this quality is to its credit. But something is lost when Hanna (Ronan) and Erik (Bana) are parted. Is it the brilliant chemistry and timing between father and daughter; the wonderful dialogue; or just the way the film builds its mystery by revealing small nuggets for us to nibble? Whatever it is I was just a tad disappointed to see father and daughter split. And although Marissa (Blanchett)is a cold and unpleasant customer she is never quite as evil as the opening sequence suggests.But the film has unforgettable moments when Hanna faces sounds (noise is perhaps a better word) and electricity for the first time or the inadequacy of her most profoundly rehearsed lines when she happens upon other people. It is beautifully acted and choreographed.And the clever mix of fragile young woman and superhuman skills is a deftly dealt with conundrum as is observed with Hanna's ""first kiss"" scene. Ultimately the film concludes in a satisfactory manner although I was left wondering if the screenplay could have been better arranged and delivered to greater effect.Cinematography and sound are excellent throughout and the acting is of a satisfactorily high standard. Recommended.",Hanna
122,PCT1970,Ronan Rules,7,6 May 2019,"I am about to view the series on which this movie is based, so I thought it best to check out the movie first and I'm pleased I made the choice. Wright has directed and exceptional thriller. The aspect I found most interesting is that it is a sort of coming of age movie, however the teenager is a very well trained assassin. This film has excellent direction, screenplay ,cinematography, settings, score and acting. The score is brilliant as it adds intensity to the plot. All the artists involved deliver considerable performances. Bana, Blanchett and Hollander are superb however Ronan commands the screen and is outstanding. The plot revolves around a 15 year old girl, Hanna who was raised in the wilderness of Finland by her father, Erik who is a rogue ex-CIA operative. Hanna is trained in military combat mostly focusing on defensive measures as well as being tutored about civilization with topics ranging from music to mammals to literature and most importantly her identity. Erik has informed Hanna that when she decides to leave and enter society she has one goal, assassinate a senior CIA agent Marissa. He informs her once she decides to go there is no turning back and Marissa will not stop until Hanna is dealt with, but does not disclose why. Hanna informs Erik she is ready to leave and they make plans to reunite in Berlin, as Erik gets a head start on their departure from the wilderness. Hanna is captured and taken to an underground CIA facility in Morocco where she is being monitored by Marissa. Through her training and chicanery Hanna manages to escape, but not before leaving some bodies in her wake. After being chased through the desert Hanna meets a family on vacation which befriend her and she hitches a ride to a ferry heading for Spain with the intent on reaching Berlin. In the meantime Marissa is forced to go outside the CIA for assistance and hires an ex-CIA agent Isaacs. Isaacs is accompanied by two Neo-Nazi looking henchmen and he is dressed more like a casual tennis player and has a penchant for whistling. During his pursuit of Hanna we learn that his attire is a cover up for a much more sinister, vicious and cunning individual. During her journey Hanna has come across some information that has her confused as to who she really is. Hanna arrives at her rendezvous point to meet Erik and is met buy a whimsical magician named Knepfler who lives in an abandoned amusement park. Marissa arrives at the park and before Hanna avoids escape she learns that Erik is not her biological father. Hanna eventually meets Erik and he reveals the truth about his past and who Hanna really is. The plot is action packed, thrilling, violent, clever, insightful, duplicitous, blazing and has a cathartic ending. There are many examples of symbolism and a major theme to the film. In this viewer's opinion the major theme is that once introduced into the real world, Hanna turns out to be more humane than humanity. One of the best examples of symbolism occurs when Hanna encounters Marissa at the end and drops her much like she did with the deer she hunted in the wilderness. Another example is the amusement park is symbolic of the fake existence that Hanna has been led to believe. There are also many memorable scenes. This viewer's favorite is when Hanna stays in a room in Morocco and is introduced to electricity, television, lamps, a bathtub, etc. These were things she had only read about and her shock and awe displayed during the experience is an awakening as to how diluted her reality is. This is a well rounded entertaining film and is respectable in the thriller genre.",Hanna
123,mirwais-orbit,The Hanna Identity,8,30 April 2011,"Being a Joe Wright movie it was supposed that Hanna would't be some ordinary action movie. The film is much more a dramaction than any other genre, and let's be honest, is one of the best so far in 2011. It drinks a lot from the awesome Bourne Trilogy that became a reference and made several other directors try to recreate the same formula without success. So Hanna maybe is the most successful and perhaps one of the best films of its genre since 2007's The Bourne Ultimatum.I say this because as I said above, is not just an action movie, the drama is also present and very well located. The drama about a killer chasing its identity never meant to be something original, but like The Bourne Trilogy, what calls for attention isn't the plot, but how everything succeeds. And it's impressive. Joe Wright really brings something fresh, from the edition to the soundtrack, everything is thrilling as it should, it's intense, heartless and cold as it's shown in the beginning and as the main character is supposed to be. One of the things that most impressed me about this film along with its edition, soundtrack and performances were the filming locations. There is always this ambiguous mix between adult acts and naiveté places that happens a lot, a very impressive contrast which shocks the audience naturally dismissing showing more than it's shown, intensifying the violence without being explicit, being emotional without being cheesy.Saorsie Ronan is proving to be a great actress and maybe she will be remembered in the future as the best of her generation. Her acting is something intense, emotional and natural and together with Cate Blanchett this movie dismiss any comments about the performances, which are superb from everyone and only adds more qualities to this rare and amazing industrial piece of art.As happened with Daft Punk's soundtrack for Tron: Legacy (2010), the soundtrack by The Chemichal Brothers is also one of the gears of entire movie and its action sequences. Their sound is more than just a soundtrack, it's an extension of what is happening in Hanna's mind, bringing out something naive and also deconstructed in brutal drums and synthesizers giving goose bumps every time the sounds get louder as images become intense, an amazing experience and a fantastic action atmosphere.I can't imagine Hanna being a franchise as it's not a movie for all kinds of audience because there's more than ordinary action flicks can offer, but surely would be interesting see Hanna back 5 or 10 years later, necessary time to make another movie as good as this one is.",Hanna
124,blacklist-1,A superb action thriller that has substance.,8,7 May 2011,"Hanna has been compared to Kick-ass, a young girl having astonishing fighting skills. That is indeed true but this is more tame and the girl is older than Hit-Girl who was eleven. Hanna (Saoirse Ronan) is a sixteen year old girl who is seen out in the forest hunting down a deer with a bow and arrow and practising fighting with a man who turns out to be her father Erik (Eric Bana). They live in a cabin in the forest where he educates Hanna with an encyclopedia, mantra's to do with her being an assassin and reading her fairytale stories. Meanwhile the CIA who Eric used to work for are trying to track them down as they have been for many years namely by the head Marrisa (Cate Blanchett). Eventually Eric and Hanna separate as she escapes from CIA headquarters when captured, she travels to Berlin to find Eric who waits for her there. On the way she encounters a normal kind family who take her in where she interacts with the daughter of about the same age Sophie played by young actress Jessica Barden. As Hanna travels her and her father have to face CIA agents and Marissa herself who comes after them.This is a terrific action thriller directed by Joe Wright who was previously responsible for the hit film Atonement, which I surprisingly enjoyed. And whether by coincidence or not he and actress Saoirse Ronan have worked together again. This is for Wright his first action movie and he has carried it off with great aplomb. Regrettably there are a couple of weaknesses as the story itself of Hanna's past is a bit sketchy with a twist near the end about her that didn't really surprise me. Furthermore though I rather like Eric Bana as an actor like his memorable performance as the Romulan villain Nero in Star Trek in 2009 and he was pretty good as the lead in Hulk. Unfortunately I am afraid he just isn't convincing here for me. I just didn't feel he expressed emotion for Hanna and as a result there is little bonding between them here. He sounded very monotone as though he just decided to put in a half-hearted effort. Luckily the rest of the cast fare much better. Cate Blanchett as Marrisa (giving an excellent American accent by the way) has a convincing icy demeanour, which serves her well. Also Jessica Barden as the daughter Sophie gives a great cameo performance in her scenes and makes her character very engaging to watch. But the best person in this was Irish actress Saorise Ronan. She was terrific in Atonement and The Lovely Bones (where though her acting was great, she was misused as the whole film was a disaster). She looks set to become one of the best actresses in the future if she keeps pulling off performances like this. She gives her best one yet as Hanna. She is totally convincing as a cold blooded assassin, but humanises her whole character with the wonder of a child as she indulges in fairy tales and learns (quite amusingly I might add) how to interact with the family who pick her up and kiss her first boy. She carries this off with a great maturity, which I highly admire. The scenes between her and Sophie are very engaging to watch and with the short scenes they have you feel a real emotional bond between her and Hanna, which gives the film heart as it makes you care about what happens to her and for an action film to have that is most surprising, but makes it refreshingly different. The action itself, which has plenty is exciting and superbly choreographed particularly the fight Eric has in the subway station and Hanna evading CIA men on shipping containers. It is also very stylistically shot with some unconventional camera shots and angles you would not expect in a Hollywood film. The cinematography is beautifully shot and with some real memorable scenery of the snowy forest and the hot desert, the musical score by the Chemical Brothers is also top notch and one of the most enjoyable musical scores in film I have heard this year so far.Hanna isn't a perfect film, but it is certainly very good and one of the better action films this year that I highly enjoyed with some great acting, heart and stylist making being the main points that won me over. With a high rating overall of a 7.6 I was afraid at first before I went to see this that it would be another overrated audience statement with the last two films I saw Insidious and the hideously bad Thor, but Hanna was rated right for me and deserves a lot of praise. This is one action thriller that does have substance, which marks it above most action films that are just trashy fun. I looked forward in future to seeing actress Saorise Rohan in film projects. Hanna is the best film she has been in and with the way it ends I don't see why there can't be a sequel. I hope there will be one. Action thrillers don't get more thrilling than this.",Hanna
125,plasticanimalz,Awesome!,9,22 June 2012,"This was my favorite and pretty much only action movie I've been more than entertained by, since the Bourne Identity series. Everyone who is making negative comments are referencing films like 'Resident Evil' and their comments about the plot, like, ""Her teeth bleeding while she brushed them was irrelevant to the plot,"" are ridiculous. Clearly the people who didn't like this movie typically like really BAD action movies and probably think 'The Expendables' or 'Fast and Furious' deserve an Oscar. People who comment on indie films should have to show proof of a grade point average or intelligence test, since they seem to not know how real films are made, how people act in the real world and not in a Quentin Terrantino film, and that story is actually desirable in a film, EVEN an action film. I seriously worry for the human race when it seems on a lot of these boards the comments people make about plot holes, or problems with the film, that if they actually LISTENED to the film, it was explained. Listen, if you can't keep up with an action film that has a little more story and depth than the all of 30 seconds they give to most action films, you probably shouldn't comment on these boards and reveal what a dunderhead you are. Or at least comment first that you usually like stupid films and are completely out of touch with reality, ""So, I didn't like this film but you might."" I was planning to write what was so great about this film but reading the idiotic comments of people who couldn't keep up with a fairly basic plot line, who left negative comments, really annoyed me. Anyway, I saw this film in the theater and turned on the TV last night and it was on, and I couldn't turn the channel. I had meant to watch something else but this film is so good and engrossing I couldn't turn away.Oh, and to the people who didn't like this movie, you might want to check out 'The Watch' with Ben Stillar, Vince Vaugn and that 'Super Bad' kid. You will probably love it since it's an Americanized, stupid rip off of 'Attack the Block,' which was an indie film, so, you probably would not like the original film, even though they don't tell stupid jokes in it, like the American version, and completely placate the audience.",Hanna
126,ThreeGuysOneMovie,An Action Movie for the Independent film Crowd,8,20 September 2011,"The best way I can describe this movie is that it's an action movie for the independent film crowd. On the surface this movie seems like a Bourne Identity clone. Saoirse Ronan plays Hanna a young girl who has been trained from birth by her father Erik (Eric Bana) to be the perfect assassin. Erik has been training Hanna for one purpose, to kill a government agent that wronged him named Marissa (Cate Blanchett). What follows is a pretty standard person on the loose being hunted by the CIA type thriller.Beneath the surface though, this movie becomes much more interesting. What it is really about is twisted coming of age tale that plays out like a bizarre fairy tale. Complete with a wicked witch (Marissa) and a climactic ending in a surreal looking fantasy land (an abandoned amusement park).I really enjoyed this film and I was pretty blown away by Saoirse Ronan as Hanna. She did an amazing job with a pretty complicated and multi-layered role. Cate Blanchett was also a stand out. She was excellent in the role of the evil CIA agent.Hanna might be a bit slowly paced for some of the action junkies out there but there is a fair amount of action, and lot of depth to movie. I recommend checking this one out.",Hanna
127,palavitsinis,Amazing little girl! Not that plausible,7,10 December 2015,"The movie was really really good for my taste, don't misunderstand the title. Of course it was not plausible for this little girl to have done some of the things she did during the movie, and this was mainly the reason why I didn't rate it higher. Having said that, this movie is an example of how a single person can hold the entire movie on their own. This little girl with the amazingly captivating face was enough. Her blue eyes and expression was enough to keep you glued to the screen. Of course, amazing supporting cast, my personal favorite Cate Blanchett, and Eric Bana that was phenomenal. I enjoyed each minute and stayed at the edge of my seat for the ending. Maybe not a clear 7, but close enough for me!",Hanna
128,LOL101LOL,Started well enough,6,2 August 2011,"I was looking forward to this film, I like a good action thriller, spy type of film. And it started really well, it was really nicely filmed, so things were looking really good.But it did not have the legs to take that great start till the end, it just got a bit to predictable for me, but it was still o.k entertainment but it was nothing new and to much of a copy of other films.I still wonder every time I see a Hollywood made film that has none Americans in the leading roles, what not enough unemployed home grown actors in Hollywood? I still don't get it, but that's not to say the actors did not do a good enough job, the acting was solid from all performers, but I just did not like Cate Blanchett terrible fake American accent.But I still gave it a 6 out of 10, not great but not bad either, but it is not on my have to watch again list.6 out of 10",Hanna
129,cadillac20,Fantastic Character Driven Action Piece,9,8 April 2011,"Hannah is a wholly unexpected, but entirely enjoyable film. However, this is not the all out, balls to the wall action film the trailer might suggest. There is a high art house value to the film, and it takes it's time letting you get to know the characters, most notably the titular character Hannah, as she explores the world for the first time. What we have is the kind of action film that comes around every once in a while that values it's characters, but also demonstrates some great action pieces.Hannah tells the story of the 16 year old girl who, after living her whole life in the woods, is set upon the world. At the same time, her release into the world sets in motion a man hunt by a CIA agent with her own agenda. I've read many comments comparing this to Kick Ass, and I couldn't figure it out for the life of me. While these two films share loose ingredients, they are wholly different films, with Hannah arguably the superior film. Beautifully shot and fantastic all the way around, the film elevates itself to art by successfully balancing Bourne-style action and a beautiful coming of age story. Through the film, we see the world as Hannah sees it, with a sense of wonder and beauty, but also a sense of confusion. Sound is used to great effect to depict this as well, and I will be very disappointed if this film doesn't get nominated for every sound award next year. The cast and talent behind the film also help to elevate it above the standard pic. Particularly Joe Wright, who treads into different territory, but nonetheless proves that he is an extremely versatile director. Saoirse Ronan also excels as the lead here, playing up the hardened, but vulnerable character. It's not an easy role to fill the shoes of, with both a physical and emotional demand on the characters, but in Wright's hands, Saoirse nails it.While the film does have moments of drag here and there, even these moments are filled with something visually or audibly interesting. If it's not the Chemical Brother's fantastic soundtrack or a unique shot here and there, it's the stylish editing and unique focus. I will say that this won't be for everyone. This is not a film that's constant action and it does have an independent quality to it. But for those that take the journey, you'll find a very rewarding film here that succeeds where many action films don't. I'll even go so far as to say that this is my favorite film of 2011 so far.",Hanna
130,dcobbimdb,"Good movie, wrong score / music",6,30 May 2012,"So I hate to sound judgemental about foreign flicks and while I can admire how they just do things a little differently, often times I'm just not really drawn in and this was the case here with Hanna. That said I have very much admired a few other foreign movies such as 28 days later, district 9, Killing Zoe, and even Push. And to be clear I'm lumping anything non US into this classification although this movie is English spoken, so no annoying subtitles or anything other than a few Spanish / Italian lines.The story itself is intriguing and the ruthlessness of the characters especially Cate Blanchett is quite good. The action is believable and shot well, so the movie kept my interest the whole time. About the only thing I didn't like was the music, and this is what reminded me every action scene that I was watching a foreign made film. Music IMHO can really make or break a movie and while this is extremely subjective, unless its a night club scene, sparing session or a tournament I just don't care for this kind of techno for the action scenes in this particular movie. Not because I don't like techno as I do, it's just that while it sets forth an urgent and exciting pace which does coincide with the action it also creates an unavoidable fun game-like feel which ripped all the suspense out of the movie whereas more fitting music in these scenes would have reeled you in making you feel frightened or on the edge of your seat for Hanna's life such that you forget your watching a movie but rather feel part of it. Yet I kept feeling like I either needed to pick up a game controller and start pushing buttons or just get up and dance a jig. As an example in The Matrix, the sparing scene in the dojo and the shootout in the lobby was all high paced techno but it worked well as those were supposed to be fun scenes, however the fight with Agent Smith and Morpheus and Neo and when the centennials were breaching the ship it turned to more urgent fearful music which gave you a sense of real danger and this is what I totally feel like they missed the mark on with Hanna. I was never on the edge of my seat, never felt like she was in any real danger, wasn't suspenseful at all, all because of the music...The other thing that kind of bugged me were the three thugs, Cate played her character well and installed a sense of cold fear into me, but her three goons to me just seemed like rejected gang members. Especially the leader wearing his jump suit. Who knows maybe they are big time actors for all I know but it just seemed like they ran out of money and yelled out into the crowd ""okay who wants to play some bad thugs and be on TV?""Aside from the music bouncing me out of the movie (and again this is completely subjective) and the three stooges I thought the acting, story, action and flow was overall pretty good and if there was more befitting music I could see giving it a solid 8/10, but as it is 6/10 is what it ranks for me",Hanna
131,quinnox-1,Very stylish but uneven drama/thriller,8,9 April 2011,"This movie is interesting in the way it was filmed. There are parts which seem like a music video, and then other moments that are sensitive and unexpected. The girl who is the main character, Hanna, has a face the camera loves, she is a classic ""ice queen"". A girl who is beautiful to look at, but also cold and brittle to the touch. She has a magnetism on screen and special acting ability for sure, I will watch for her in movies to come.The plot is confusing though, and not enough is explained until the very end, which makes the whole chase less interesting. Even after the end of the film I still had questions as to the story and the reasons why things happened. Another problem was sometimes the director seemed to be filming in a self indulgent way and went over the top in his style. But there are also some very enjoyable parts in the movie that surprised me, like when Hanna befriends a quirky, hippie-like English family traveling on vacation and the intriguing friendship she develops with a girl around her own age, and the mini-adventures she goes on with the family discovering a foreign culture. Very good scenes and chemistry between these two young actresses, I thought these were the best moments of the movie.I tend to enjoy movies filmed in an experimental and non-standard way so I give this one high marks despite the problems with the main plot line and overdoses of director style at times.",Hanna
132,timmy_501,"Nice images, mediocre everything else",7,25 November 2011,"Hanna is a film about a girl who is trained from birth to be a special agent. Her dry, unimaginative father takes her to the tundra where he teachers her survival, combat, and languages successfully. Less successful are his attempts to give her knowledge of the world outside their wintry boundaries. Her father forces her to memorize dry facts without context, which proves to be no substitute for experience. Since she grows up without electricity or any modern conveniences, Hanna is particularly unsuited to urban missions. Eventually this all has to end and teenage Hanna is thrust into the world she is eager to enter yet ill equipped to deal with. With Hanna, director Joe Wright shows that he is able to create striking images, mostly through his superb use of light and color. Unfortunately, in spite of the striking still images that frequently appear in Hanna, the moving images tend to be less impressive. Like certain other action directors, Wright overuses shaky cam. He also doesn't properly utilize tracking shots, instead relying on quick cuts from various perspectives to convey the action. On the bright side, Wright isn't afraid to take some risks with editing, though there's at least one sequence in which he goes overboard with this, splintering the frame into a clock like mosaic of Hanna faces. While the cinematic aspects of Hanna are somewhat uneven, the writing is appallingly mediocre. The plot mostly consists of trite and pointless chase scenes ending in workmanlike action sequences that tend to lack the proper set up needed to create a real sense of urgency. None of the villains really project much menace, especially when their meager skills are compared to the superhuman abilities of hardened killer Hanna. Although I don't normally worry about fight choreography, I had the bad fortune of watching this the day after I saw Ip Man, a film inferior to this one in all ways except for the truly excellent fight choreography. Compared to that film's fights, the ones in Hanna felt downright sluggish. In spite of my reservations about Hanna, I have to admit that the pacing was handled quite well and the scenes of Hanna attempting to fit into normal society worked in spite of themselves. This is a pretty fair piece of escapist entertainment from a director with potential.",Hanna
133,julian-mumford,"""...and what did your mother die of""",6,22 February 2012,"We first meet Hanna blending into her snow capped surroundings, whilst hunting and killing a deer twice her size with a bow and arrow. Without catching a breath, she then disarms a ferocious unprovoked attack by a man also double her size, all rather rather odd when Hanna is just sixteen years old.That her CIA operative attacker is her father gone rogue, hiding himself and his daughter in the wilderness, following an earlier event, is again somewhat unusual.So starts this thriller by director Joe Wright, who has talented actors to help him tell this initially unusual story. Eric Bana is Erik, bringing up his daughter with revenge clearly focused on his mind. Tutored in multiple combat arts, languages and book acquired knowledge, Hanna (Saoirse Ronan) is like a finely tooled weapon, honed, poised and ready to be unleashed at a target of Erik's choosing.Hanna has the choice to turn on a homing beacon, thereby challenging the authorities, Marissa (Cate Blanchett) to locate her and allow the plan to unfold. Quite why the odd couple would choose to announce their intentions in such an obvious way seems strange, would not surprise be a more effective tactic for this close but most dysfunctional of families.Actress Ronan Saoirse has obviously received training to emulate the moves and skills required to appear plausible. The audience can comfortably believe she is capable of anything, even after she is semi adopted by a free wheeling bohemian family holidaying through warm unidentified countries.The movie plays fast and loose with locations, never seeming to end up where you would expect, leading to an almost surreal ending, loosely based around a Brothers Grimm fairy tale theme park.The film does appear to falter in it's direction and focus about the midpoint, Tom Hollander as ""Isaacs"" manages to add malevolent quirkiness to the mix but the whole plot and subsequent dealings, appears so far off the CIA books, it all becomes wildly implausible.There is fun to be had, Blanchett is never boring on screen, Ronan continues to impress as she throws herself into a full on action role. Bana does appear rather uncomfortable with the accent his character is saddled with and his motivations are somewhat muddled through no fault of his own.There are some good lines, ""...and what did your mother die of"", the innocent question is asked, ""Three bullets"" is the quick reply.This is not the usual shoot-em up, run and gun movie, there is depth to be discovered and this is enhanced by an offbeat lead female character. However the film does suffer as the director seemingly loses touch with the films intentions, the latter parts exhibiting a reflective mood which does seem to contradict the early premise.Summary A fine thriller with some great performances, notably the lead but somewhat let down by a rather unrealistic plot and a loss of focus as the film progresses.Cautiously recommended http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/",Hanna
134,basilisksamuk,Action movie unbelievable shock! Get over it and watch pure film.,9,4 March 2012,"Let's get the obvious out of the way, shall we? The plot is derivative of so many other things it's not true, with Nikita being the obvious reference point. The acting isn't particularly strong, the script is barely adequate and the plot is neither internally coherent nor believable. In other words it's like every other action film ever made from Bond to Bourne and all points between. So what was everyone expecting who went to see this movie? Shakespeare? On the other hand I would rate this as one of those rare experiences of seeing pure film. That is to say that there is the perfect marriage between image and music that makes it something quite different to the normal. The composition and direction of this film are really quite extraordinary with scene after scene catching the eye and making the commonplace clichés of the action genre seem fresh. The choice of music is inspired and the way that is has been synced to the action serves to heighten the tension in the scenes.The film also manages to avoid the usual problem of over-reliance on CGI with the effects that are used being spare and for a reason. At one point we have a chase and fight in a container port and I was expecting the worst. Where did this scenario come from? I suspect it was one of the early Dirty Harry films and the container port shootout/chase has since become a compulsory element in all bad action movies and features in multiple episodes of TV thrillers. In 99 times out of 100 it's lazy, it's boring and it's the same as every other one you've seen. Well Joe Wright has done the seemingly impossible by making his container port scene exciting and different.Look, you're not going to learn the meaning of life or even the meaning of the plot by watching this movie. If you enjoy cinema however, and by that I mean the use of images, light and music to propel the story then I think you'll like this.",Hanna
135,SeriousJest,"Captivating and entertaining, with an awesome cast",8,5 April 2012,"This film features: an awesome, edge-of-your-seat story; great dialogue; a tuff soundtrack; captivating camera work; diverse international settings, and even cool fonts reminiscent of a Sergio Leone flick. The cast was incredible; Blanchett continues to show great versatility and general badassness, and young Ronan actually outdoes Natalie Portman in The Professional (although, to be fair, Ronan's character is much more amazing). Additionally, if you look beyond the action and suspense, you'll find commentary about science ethics, family, identity, free will, and social chains on individual development.This movie is worth owning, but it falls just short of being a Must Own, since the action scenes are decent, but not impressive enough to want to watch over and over again. Also, a couple of aspects of the film are a bit of a stretch–for instance, it's hard to believe that Hanna is overwhelmed by the wonders of basic electrical gadgets, but then a couple of days later, she's doing internet research. Overall, though, this is a solid, delightful movie, and you should make the time to watch it at some point.",Hanna
136,MovieProductions,"Eye popping, charming, original, I liked ""Hanna""",7,17 April 2011,"*** out of (****)After critical and user speculation, I decided to seek out ""Hanna"". And it turns out, this movie is a winner, and actually one of my favorites so far that this year has to offer. While it's packed heavy with combat, guns, and kickass little girls, there's more depth and substance underneath it all. Thanks to a nice script and solid performers.""Hanna"" revolves around the namesake protagonist, a mere 16 years of age, being trained by her far to become an assassin. However, people are looking trying to find her. Hanna, meanwhile, travels across country in search to find more about her, her surroundings, and the people around her.First of all, the performances in this movie were fantastic. Ronan was just exceptional in her role. Her disposition, her dialogue, just her character. I loved her. Blanchett was equally as impressive, playing the role of the antagonist. Although, that's expected Blanchett did a good job. That woman is on a role. And finally, Eric Bana, who, not as impressive as the two leading ladies, still has a lot to offer.And for you action junkies, this is probably the most stylistic action you'll see in a film. The action is handled very authentically, and is shot just brilliantly. Hardly are there ever fast cuts (i.e. ""Transformers), and the scenes are just shot with so much energy. Not to mention, the cinematography in this movie is just gorgeous. I loved the winter set pieces, and when Hanna traveled from country to country. Also, I'm not sure if I'm the only one, but ""Hanna"" reminded me heavily of the novel ""Whirligig"". Both deal with protagonists traveling across country in search of themselves, and what's around them. Not to mention both had committed some sort of action to send them there. Just the situations, and locations. I think, looking at it that way, just makes this movie that much stronger.All in all, it's no surprise why ""Hanna"" has such strong critical reception. It has the elements of a good movie, and then some. I'm just surprised that April has offered us a lot of great movies (""Insidious"", ""Source Code"", ""Hanna""). Hopefully the following month can pave the way. Eye popping, charming, original, I liked ""Hanna""",Hanna
137,bjones,A fast ride ...,8,11 April 2011,"I was originally not going to screen this film as it looked like a common actioner and I felt I'd seen enough of those recently. However, I was drawn to change my mind solely by the casting of Saoirse Ronan in the title role as Hanna. There is just something inherently interesting about this young lady. Her screen presence is uncannily strong; she comes across as a much older and experienced woman of the world. It's what the ancients called an ""old soul"". I was also curious to see how someone so young stood against top professionals like Eric Bana as Erik and Cate Blanchett as Marissa. Blanchett is especially great and dominates just about every scene in every other movie I've seen her in.Bana started off strong in the role of Hanna's father and ultimately her trainer and coach in martial arts. He occupied a surprisingly short space of screen time, but what he did was terrific. Blanchett was just as powerful in her role, coming off quite handily as a very bad girl. Watching them on screen I couldn't help but remember that both are from Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. But Blanchett is very dynamic, very strong in drawing attention to herself and diving into a role up to her elbows. I've never seen her in anything where I thought her performance wasn't of the absolute best quality. So, when she's in a film, much is expected and she always delivers. This film was no exception.But in spite of those two remarkable stars, the majority of the film was dominated by the presence, perhaps the sheer will of Saoirse Ronan. It's hard to take your eyes off of her. Her remarkable beauty, and it truly is remarkable, is only a fraction of the draw. There are far more interesting aspects to her that what she has to offer externally. She has a calm confidence rare in the young and it lends her an aura of believability in a role that is a treasure to watch. If she could package and peddle that there are quite a few other people in her profession that could stand to buy a bushel. On top of those qualities she delivered a very lengthy and strenuous performance with every scene of the film pivoting on her.Other standout performances were from the absolutely, captivatingly charming Jessica Barden as the very chatty Sophie who becomes Hanna's friend. She was fun to watch too. Also outstanding were Olivia Williams as Sophie's mom Rachel and Jason Flemyng as Sophie's dad Sebastian. They added a welcome respite from the intensity of the rest of the scenes. They portray a quirky British bohemian-type family on holiday in a van who accidentally make Hanna's acquaintance and then she stows away when they take to the road again.Two other performances that struck me as especially good were from Tom Hollander as a slimy bad guy named Isaacs who was working for Blanchett's character. Very good was the woman who played Sophie's apparent grandmother, Gudrun Ritter as Katrin. Her performance was short, but memorable.Beyond the eye candy on the screen (and such a wonderful cast was exactly that) we have the underlying fabric of the story itself. Action movies many times have a bare bones plot that doesn't stand up to scrutiny, usually due to discrepancies and contradictions. This film had a little more meat in that department. It at least made sense in an odd sort of way.The cinematography was superb; so my hat's off to Alwin H. Kuchler. It was a beautiful film to watch in many ways, beginning with the extremely cold terrain in Finland. Cold never looked quite so cold.In conclusion I'd say that it was definitely entertaining and just different enough from the usual action film that the story won't bore you. Very interesting to me is the blatant underlining of a beautiful, talented, captivating young lady as a credible action star. This may bode well for her future as the structure of this film leaves TONS of room for a number of sequels. They could even transform her into a champion for all time. It you heard a slight clink then it was the sound of my dropping of a gauntlet in from of the makers of this film. Are you up to the challenge? By Bruce L.

138,horizon2008,In some ways.... beautiful,8,12 May 2011,"Im sure I haven't much more to add to the reviews here already, but I thought I would totally know what this movie would be like and in a lot of ways I was wrong. Yes, its a trained killer who's on the run, with a big corporation in pursuit, blah blah blah, and we've all seen these kind of movies before, but there was a strange subtlety about Hanna that made it rise above the pack in my eyes (and very much in my ears). In some scenes as Hanna travels across Europe you get a real sense of feeling for where she is. A very intimate feeling of how it would be to be there. The vastness of the desert, the warm night and sights in Morocco, as she walks through the underground in Berlin unflinching in the danger that might be there, and the melancholy of the abandoned amusement park. Quite beautiful I thought. And there's a little splash of a puddle as shes being chased through the container yard at the docks that I literally smiled at, I don't know why, but it just stood out as something wonderful. It was so subtle and brilliant in an otherwise cranked up chase scene that it shone in its addition. Added to the scene where she and the English girl are in the tent together with a quite tender moment in soft lighting, I constantly thought that Hanna (the movie) worked hard to not be just another cold, trained killer, flick with a random throwaway love scene for good measure. No, its not flawless by any means, as some have (quite rightly) pointed out. But as these kinds of tales go, it was a good one. And as for the Chemical Brothers soundtrack.... wow! Are we entering an era now of great dance bands doing great soundtracks? (the other being Daft Punks excellent Tron OST). Me? I loved Hanna. And I so looked forward to the demise of that little, short, twisted guy with the blonde hair in it (always a good sign of a good baddie if you catch my drift). Anyway, recommended. And I will definitely watch it again.",Hanna
139,kitellis-98121,After a promising start it spirals quickly downhill.,4,11 July 2018,"The film got off to a very promising start, with an interesting premise and indications that it would develop into a thrilling and intense ride.Things started to get muddled upon arrival in Morocco, but the earlier promises continued to entice. By the time we arrived in Berlin, all hope for any promised thrills had evaporated, although there was plenty of intensity - mainly from the music score which, in my personal opinion, was borderline unbearable.The visuals also morphed into increasingly (and annoyingly) self-conscious stylisation, with overly colourful lighting - which made the whole thing resemble oversaturated VHS - and set design that belonged more in a Tim Burton fantasy.The visual symbolism was heavy handed and if everybody had taken their clothes off it would not have been unlike a Ken Russell offering.For the final 30 minutes I was praying for it to end.By far the worst of Joe Wright's films.",Hanna
140,twilliams76,A fairy-tale suspense thriller,7,13 July 2011,"Joe Wright (Pride & Prejudice, Atonement, The Soloist) proves he can direct almost anything with Hanna, Focus Features' new artsy-action-adventure-thriller starring one of the BEST young actresses alive, Saoirse Ronan (Atonement, The Lovely Bones, City of Ember). (Elle Fanning is another one to watch) Brought up in the forests of northern Europe by her father (Eric Bana - Hulk, Munich, Troy), Hanna is a tough, quick, intelligent child taught how to survive and fend for herself while she isn't being taught the ways of the world with nightly readings of encyclopedic entries. Hanna and her father are both wanted by a lethal, cunning and cold government agent played by a chilling Cate Blanchett (Elizabeth, The Aviator, Lord of the Rings 1-3). The details as to why they are hunted/wanted slowly unfold and Blanchett makes for a mesmerizing foil.Hanna's supporting players are also excellent casting choices. Tom Hollander (Pride & Prejudice, Valkyrie, Gosford Park) plays a well-dressed (!), mentally-deranged goon (a friend of Blanchett's) hot on the girl's trail. (Even the well thought-out costume choices for both him and Blanchett help elevate Hanna above standard fare -- one can tell hers was meticulously chosen). Olivia Williams (The Sixth Sense, An Education, Rushmore) and Jason Flemyng (... Benjamin Button, Clash of the Titans, Snatch) play helpful ""gypsies"" who's daughter Jessica Barden (Tamara Drewe, ""Coronation Street"", Mrs. Ratcliffe's Revolution) befriends Hanna in the barren mountains of Morocco. ""Downton Abbey""'s Michelle Dockery has a brief role as an unfortunate government operative that shows EVERYONE Hanna is well-trained and should not be underestimated.The film is better than most action films as the plot and script are smart and it beautifully and masterfully employs ""fairy tale"" plots/themes/settings/characters throughout its entire run (the film's conclusion takes place in an abandoned amusement park complete with a Big Bad Wolf and a gingerbread house). Hanna has a few moments of total clarity and cinematic genius ... and I salute Wright for all of his successes here (the deer I will say is very well done).This is an action film you have to listen to as well as watch ... or you'll miss out on important elements of it. There might be one-too-many close escapes (or six!) to believe, but the film is fast-paced and smooth with some viscerally visual scenes ... and as it is a modern-take on a fairy tale the escapes could be perfectly acceptable.As this Hanna doesn't know a thing about music, I will say Hanna is the anti-Hannah Montana (it is everything that one is not). I was pleased with this picture ... and I eagerly await Wright's next film -- Anna Karenina.",Hanna

142,ernesti,"Outlandish, stylishness in just another action film.",4,28 January 2015,"I just watched this film because the beginning was filmed in Finland. That's just a bad excuse to watch an action film if I don't really like action genre in general. So what i just saw was an action film with lots of carelessly easy violence and lots of running around. There's cartoonish cardboard characters that are just plain evil or just totally on the good side and a plot that is quite obvious and there isn't many surprises on the way to the end.Lots of films like this have been made with outlandish elements that were supposed to stand out and make the action film unique. I felt that the film was too childish, too predictable and the synth score just makes it sound and look cheap.I have to question which age group was the intended audience for this film. It's way too juvenile at the same time and very violent. I may have become an old dinosaur but i feel that it's plain wrong that the violence has been made so entertaining in contemporary films. Some decades ago it wasn't made so easy. Yes I may be a hypocrite but if films are this demented it's not such a surprise that there are headlines screaming every week.",Hanna

Their threat to humanity is never explained even in the slightest degree.Should have gotten a 7 except for these bonehead mistakes.",Hanna
144,StonedMagician,Very Good: 8.5,8,26 July 2019,"Well, I literally just got back from seeing it, and, while my opinion has fully formed, what I actually think about this film has not, so forgive a little disjointedness in this review. Now, as we all know, Hanna (Saoirse Ronan) is the story of a young girl, who lives with her father (Eric Bana) in a remote forest, being rigorously, ruthlessly trained for a mission of unspecified parameters. Her education is first seen as a shocking intro sequence of the titular character mercilessly hunting a moose. She is then treated to an attack from behind from her sweet daddy, and is told that she is not ready for what she has to do, despite demonstrating extensive knowledge of martial arts, quadripedal anatomy, and four or five separate languages.Now, the tone of this film can be summed up by the nature of Hanna's only two sources of knowledge: an encyclopedia and a leather bound copy of Grimm's Fairy Tales. This movie alternates between smart thriller and modern fairy tale, an exceedingly clever combination that mesmerizes you for the entirety of its running time. Ronan will also mesmerize, as her extraordinary talent is put to good use. She is an incredibly versatile actress, able to turn on a dime from emotionless soldier to expressive little girl in less time than it takes her to gulp down a raw egg. Surprisingly enough, you pity her, sympathize for her, and laugh with her as she stumbles through her attempts to emulate normal human life. On a dare from a girl she meets, she takes some random guy she meets on a date. When they are about to kiss, she emotionlessly states that kissing requires something like thirty-four facial muscles.The villain of the piece is played by Cate Blanchett, who manages an effective, if not always completely convincing, evil mastermind. She always appears to know just enough about Hanna that the audience doesn't in order to frustrate us. She also has a distinctly menacing air about her, but unfortunately, fails to maintain it consistently enough to be a great addition to the cast. Eric Bana fares a bit better. He is the knowing, understanding mentor, the one who taught Hanna all she knows, and who, of course, is even more of a badass than she. He is fiercely devoted to her, further humanizing a sometimes inhuman-seeming character. He carries her weight on his shoulders, and it is a burden whose effects we can plainly see on his character. The considerable acting talent displayed in this film is guided by the brilliant direction of Joe Wright, who worked with Ronan on the great Atonement. He imbues the dialogue and action scenes with a subtle power that hooks you in the mouth and drags you through its murky depths. The action is relentlessly kinetic, and is fueled by a nearly pitch-perfect score courtesy of The Chemical Brothers (providers of the electronic-dance-heavy soundtrack of the Wipeout games). The cinematography is something to see. The film comes alive with color, ranging from your standard evil-lair gunmetal gray to the popping reds and oranges of a candy-shop-turned-safe-house. Yes, seriously. The sets are equally brilliant, the aforementioned candy shop, as well as the surrounding theme park, and Hanna's residential forest cabin, are logically decorated and laid out, exactly as if a former secret agent and his equally well-trained daugher were getting by on nothing but the bare necessities. Which, of course, they are.The film's single misstep is the storyline. Now, don't get me wrong: this is by no means a bad story. But it is a somewhat tired one, which didn't so much bother me, but I know will annoy some, hence my noting of it. It is, however, intelligently told, and has a charming and unique fairy-tale twist to it that just makes it that much harder to resist. The (literal) bottom line here is that, though of course not perfect, this is definitely the best action film to come out in 2011 so far, and probably one of the most unique for longer than that. It deserves your time and money, because this is exactly the kind of shot in the arm that Hollywood needs.",Hanna
145,austin-takahashi,Hanna - 4.5 Stars,9,9 February 2013,"I viewed ""Hanna"" with a mild curiosity. It feels that it started out as an average revenge thriller that was later enhanced by above average talents. The cast and crew of this film did more for the story that it could have asked of them. Sure, a lot of shooting and chasing goes around, but you can sense an evidence of planning and patience within them. The creators of ""Hanna"" operated with a vision of an audience with an attention span slightly longer than that of others.The film opens somewhere near the Arctic Circle. A teenage girl, named Hanna (Saoirse Ronan), has just killed a deer with an arrow, followed by a bullet. She drags the carcass of the animal through the deep, icy snow to a cabin in the woods where her father, Erik (Eric Bana), is waiting for her. Not the best conditions for a teenage girl, I'm sure. We learn that father and daughter have been in this place since Hanna was still an infant. She has been homeschooled all her life. And because Erik is a wanted CIA agent, he forms Hanna into the perfect assassin.Not everyone gets to master martial arts and firearms at that early age, and the secluded home of Hanna offers little distractions. But, this lifestyle is not without disadvantages. Except for her own father, Hanna has not known any other person. Her books tell her that the world contains so much, and she knows that she is a stranger to almost all of them. That is probably why she was more than eager to find out that her mission will require her to travel in order to eliminate lots of bad guys, including a secretive CIA officer, Marissa Wiegler (Cate Blanchett).Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/hanna-movie-review/",Hanna
146,leftistcritic,"Action, shooting, and gore",2,19 January 2019,"It has been some time since I watched this movie but I remember it was filled with action and gore, which made the movie unwatchable from my perspective. I understand why people would watch this but I will not watch it again in the future. No way.Some people may watch this because it has Saoirse Ronan as the protagonist (Hannah), raised in northern Finland's wilderness by her father, an ex-CIA operative, while a CIA agent (played by Cate Blanchett) tries to track her down and eliminate her, along with her father. You could even say that this film had good performances from Ronan and Blanchett along with exciting action sequences and relevant themes. Even if you said all that, I would still say this film, is not, on the whole, very strong and as such deserves a rating of 2 of out 10.With that, my review of this film comes to a close.",Hanna
147,jonnyhavey,Glamour-free: A Cinematic Coming of Age Tale,6,24 April 2011,"""Hanna"" manipulates cinematography to save itself from various plot holes creating a film with impressive action sequences. It has become known as the box office dark horse of the past couple weeks because of its lack of advertising making a name for itself in second place opening weekend. ""Hanna"" is a very peculiar film because of its two plot lines, however, the main reason is that it thinks that it is much more clever than it actually is. The film stars Saoirse Ronan (""The Way Back"") along with big name stars Eric Bana (""The Time Traveler's Wife"") and Cate Blanchet (""Robin Hood""). On a basic level the film is about a sixteen-year-old girl named Hanna Heller (Ronan) who has been trained to be an assassin by her father Erik Heller (Bana). The two of them have been in hiding for a very long time in a small lodge in Finland from a woman named Marissa Wiegler (Blanchet). Once Hanna believes that she is ready to go up against Erik's mysterious CIA past she flips the switch of a tracking device sending her straight into civilization. Within the basic plot a much deeper storyline forms concerning Hanna's assimilation into society. After successfully fulfilling her father's plan of being captured by and escaping Marissa's grasp from a CIA safe house in Morroco, she secretly travels with a family to Berlin. A story of teenage friendship and development begins as Hanna befriends the daughter in the family, Sophie (Jessica Barden, ""Tamara Drew"") leading to the success of the film, while the only thing the action thriller plot brings is cinematic action sequences.Ronan and her young acting ability allows her to play any role thrown at her making her future in Hollywood very bright. There is not one other young actress that could have taken her place in this film. She receives help from her seasoned supporting cast (Bana and Blanchet), but Barden's character is the second most important character in the film and has the second best performance delving into the coming of age backdrop of the film. The cinematography and mise-en-scene are great as well filming action sequences in a chaotic yet controlled style and showing the slow divergence of color from a pale dull light to a vibrant colorful calamity.The film fails to create its own identity right from the start intertwining two distinctly different plots. The slow beginning foreshadows both that of an action film and a teenage development flick. This is followed by many sequences that do not add up and fail to be fully developed taking away from both of the film's plots. Blanchet's character in particular partakes in attempted symbolic actions resulting in ambiguity. The film chooses the wrong direction to go by its conclusion failing to resolve the much more exciting and interesting assimilation plot, while making the assassin plot's conclusion cliché and bland.""Hanna"" fails to make a name for itself on the assassin plot front, however it almost successfully has a breakthrough into the coming of age teen genre by cutting out all of the glamour of contemporary drama. However, ""Hanna"" is more successful than a comparative film (""Salt"") was last year.",Hanna
148,el_monty_BCN,Please don't waste your time with this,2,12 June 2011,"Do not believe the hype about this movie. It is just a load of pretentious cack. In ""Atonement"", I thought Joe Wright did a remarkable job, with some striking directorial flourishes such as the famous Dunkirk tracking shot, but all in the service of the story, embellishing and enriching it. In this too-wannabe-cool-for-its-own-good ""film"" (if you can call it that, because it feels rather like a two-hour music video), however, the effect is the exact opposite: every scene, every frame even, is overloaded with capricious extravagances, in what looks like a desperate attempt to mask how hopelessly formulaic and one-note the plot actually is, making it nigh impossible for the viewer not to be jolted right out of the narrative at every turn by the avalanche of distractions. Even Ronan, who has received so much praise, felt miscast to me, too lithe and ethereal to be believable for even one second in her role. But the worst sin, probably, is that after all the hullabaloo, it all boils down to an unbelievably weak and forgettable ending.",Hanna
149,criscal,Hanna-Rambo Runs,6,27 May 2011,"I have an ambivalent opinion about this movie. Acting, cinematography and soundtrack were good. The choreography and the shooting of the action scenes sucked. Don't expect an action movie anyway. The story is only a sketch and pieces get revealed without emphasis. Emotionally important parts like the fate of the family are not revealed. Others (bleeding gum) are added without any sense. Many things in the movie appear contrived and made-up and not believable e.g. catching a car at like 50 km/h at least. In the end, it appears to be just another story trimmed for success by exchanging a cliché boy/man role with a teenage girl. I guess that the girl version of Harry Potter will be coming soon on a different note.",Hanna
150,e-m-hobo,360 degrees of awesome,10,15 January 2020,"This is one of these movies where I watched the trailer and the beginning of the movie and the title for the review came to mind. Safe to say it stuck. This movie really is 360 degrees of awesome.I'm also stuck.When I look at the grades that a lot of these movies that are so perfectly or near perfectly made, meaning that their mistakes escape me and I don't feel anything is wrong, nothing feels off, even with my regular level of concentration kicking back in, it's a bit like, what the hell do these people expect?Another author than the screenwriter (I dare not say writer for he does not thus call himself and looks quite scary in his colorful peace T-shirt) Stephen King was right that (at least his thicker) books lend themselves better to television series than standard length standalone movies. That's definitely true. I haven't read any of the other reviews, but if you expect a talky to elaborate on character with this kind of a story, you're insane.The movie has guts, but not gore even though it does have guts a bit literally here and there, which is ironic. It's fast paced but with moments of comfort, warmth, and friendship in between, but these moments don't distract from and don't deter the run.So what do you do when everybody you care about becomes a target and you were raised to counter because you yourself are the bullseye? Hanna comes well equipped and if she's offered tragedy, the comedy definitely comes to an end.Great movie.",Hanna
151,blackmambamark,It's not your high octane action movie......but it's certainly one of the most artistic.,7,10 April 2011,"Can, and should artistic directors take a crack at action movies? Warner Brothers took a chance and let Christopher Nolan helm the Batman franchise, and look how brilliant that turned out. Before ""Batman Begins"", Nolan only directed ""Memento"" and ""Insomnia"". Two movies that relied more on depth and substance as opposed to action and adrenaline. And i think those two things, depth and substance, are and have been the missing ingredient in this generations action flicks. So with an academy award nominated director Joe Wright taking the wheel behind this one, i can only expect great things.For starters, the action is not as high octane as one might expect. Nolan had this problem with ""Batman Begins"" as well. By that i mean the fighting sequences are not as impressive nor filmed as well as most of your big budget action pictures. There are a lot of close in, quick cut hand movements, and then the fight is over. You get the picture that this girl is a bad ass, but you kind of want that establishing shot of her going insane on three guys at once. Instead, the fighting last only a few seconds, and you don't really know how she stuck it to em'. Imagine watching Hit-Girl in ""Kick-Ass"", but the camera is zoomed in so you can't really tell what's happening.And as far as the cinematography is concerned, that is only the real flaw in this picture. Everything else is absolutely gorgeous. If you've seen the movie ""Atonement"", then you already know what your in store for. The acting is another aspect that was incredible. Both Eric Bana and Cate Blanchett prove their range as actors......but the show stopper is obviously Saoirse Ronan. Even though i think this kid is amazing already, i think she will do nothing but grow into something even greater. She once again does an amazing job of creating this amazing stage presence.As far as a storyline......it's eh. Don't get me wrong, it did keep my interest, but there really was nothing groundbreaking about it. For example.......when they finally reveal the ultimate plot outline towards the end, your not as blown away as the director would've hoped. It feels like a story that i've already heard before.So is there really something special here? I would say yes and no. It's special because it's not your typical action picture. It's very artistic, and aside from the action sequences, it's shot very very well. Even if you become somewhat bored by the storyline, the combination of the cinematography and incredible musical score by The Chemical Brothers keep your eyes glued to the screen. But the reason why i would say 'No' is.......it's storyline is not as epic as you want it to be. Sure it starts out great. I mean come on, a little girl being trained by her father to be a mega bad-ass and survive in the wild on her own.......that's freakin' awesome. But after that.......it kind of dwindles off.Bottom Line......i did enjoy it. But do i think it's the action movie of year? Not really. But one things for sure, it will certainly be the most artistic of the bunch.",Hanna

I was angry when I left the theatre after ruining my afternoon watching a film with such a stupid, faulty plot. There are just too many mistakes and holes. Hanna is a 16 year old ANOREXIC-LOOKING supposed genetic super human. Right away you know the casting is all wrong. She looks so weak. Sometimes she kills commandos immediately, and then other times she fights with skin-head caricatures for hours it seems. Silly stuff. To view this film's comments, use the ""hated it"" filter. I think the film's cast and backers shamelessly used IMDb.com for their selfish, untrue, and dishonest promotion of the film. No one with half a brain would recommend this film. There are plot holes which should anger you. Also, we are never told why she has to die or why the skinny little girl is a threat to US security. Why does she look longingly, lesbian-like into her new friend's eyes as they are lying in bed together? What happens to that girl and her family? We are not told. What did her foster-father ever do to deserve such treatment from her at the end? He then sacrifices his life for her! She has knowledge of everything in the world, but acts like one of the Beverly Hillbillies when it comes to turning on a light or using electric appliances, but then she just walks into a computer/coffee café and goes online. This is one of the dumbest films of all time. I was just so angry to have wasted my time and money on this film that was rated so highly on IMDb. Why does this film deserve a 7.7 rating? 7.7 Oh, please. Something is really, really wrong with the ratings system if this can happen.",Hanna
154,davidfurlotte,It sounds like a 'creative' session gone bad.,2,21 July 2011,"The only reason I gave it a 2 is because the girl playing Hanna really did give it her very best even though the whole storyline sounds like something out of some really, REALLY bad creative meeting.***WARNING Herein lie SERIOUS SPOILERS*** ""Hey, let's do a story like the whole Jason Bourne thing but let's attract teenagers by making the main character be a pretty teenage girl. Oh yeah, she's been bio-engineered to be an assassin by the very EVIL CIA and...and they decided to kill the program and...and they killed off everyone they brought into the program and...and one gets away and the guy who saves her takes her to live and trains her in ninja type skills and..and."" Yeah, you get the picture. Oh, and not to mention that this guy has been living all alone with this little girl for all those years - there's a paedophile out there someplace going, ""oh yeah, baby,"" and parents of daughters going...""Oh HELL no!"" Okay, first, as all true assassins know, you let the PREY find out that you're now gunning for them by calling them to come get you so you can kill them. (Now there's an idea, instead of leaving the cabin, going to where the target is located and SURPRISING her by slitting her throat in her sleep or simply creating a tiny bomb and placing it in her apartment. Nah, that would be too simple, movie would be over in 10 minutes - hey, there's an idea.) Next, you're NOW a guest in a secure facility that makes the MINT look like an old time Western jail but you manage to get by the army of guards and security and sneak out of the place even though alarms are going off and the entire facility would be on LOCKDOWN.Oh, and I want to move to Europe because it seems that you can get a room in a hotel simply by asking for it and not paying and you can move around through all the countries with no passports or money and anytime you feel hungry just stop by some tourist family and get fed.And it just goes downhill from there. To say there are plot holes big enough to drive a Mack Truck through would be an understatement. One minute our heroine is taking out guys armed with automatic weapons and Kevlar with a flick of her wrist and the next she's working REALLY hard to try to take down a couple of goons armed with knives. Someone really needs to explain to the writers what the term CREDIBILITY means.All in all, I'm not sure if I was angry as the credits rolled or just overly confused by a lot of what I saw.",Hanna

Next it's running at full speed like Run Lola Run.Hanna (played by Saoiros Ronan of Lovely Bones) is about a girl who is trained to be a warrior by her father Erik (Eric Bana, Munich). I'll leave it at that. don't want to give away spoilers.The dynamics work fine although they don't blend as well as your typical Starbucks Coffee drink might, this is more like a well made Dunkin coffee right down to never getting what you order.Digesting all this is a little tough in that there's a sprinkle of cheesiness. It was very well avoided, and the director seemed to try very hard to keep this from happening but I still couldn't get over some things like Eric Bana's beard. They should have left it out or got some tips from those who did makeup for ""The Road"".Overall a really cool movie, that could of been a 9 but misses because of cheesiness.",Hanna
156,snelling,Took me THREE attempts to get through this!,5,6 July 2012,"I really wanted to like this. I really and truly did. It started out so well, in the bleak snow and cold of the Arctic wild. The rote and robotic teaching of young Hanna to the ways of hand-to-hand combat and her eventual mission was mesmerizing. Then the stupidity started.I won't repeat the plot-holes I have read in other posts and reviews, but if you saw this, you know the ones I mean. What I need to mention is the Cate Blanchett tooth-hygiene scene. I don't understand why she was cleaning her teeth to the point of blood gushing from her gums, and down the the bathroom drain. To show her relentlessness to even the most mundane of daily rituals? Sigh, ho-hum. Okay, she is focused in her chores and in her job. She will get what she wants eventually, I guess.Someone mentioned here that a lot of the action was just filler for the sake of it. I could not agree more. She and her father could dispatch all the bad guys quite handily if they wanted to, yet they sometimes run away when there is no threat other than more hand-to-hand combat, which they establish early on they have more than enough experience handling.My only guess is they were trying to make the father and daughter more sympathetic as the film went on, and they somehow felt bad about snapping necks and throwing knives into the hearts of their unknown attackers. If they just killed off any threat right away, there wouldn't be much of a plot. So they decide to draw it out and let the weakest assailants live longer so they can be dispatched later, or not at all. Also, the ending stunk. Almost like they planned a sequel that will never happen. Here's to hoping.",Hanna
157,edblackham,Should've been better,7,7 June 2020,I liked the build up and most of the way through the movie I really liked it. Her breaking out of her containment was well done.

158,cadfile,Don't Mess With Hanna... seriously.,8,14 October 2011,"Saw the film ""Hanna"" the other night and I really liked it. It's about a 16 year old girl trained by her father to be an assassin to get revenge for the killing of her mother. It stars Saoirse Ronan with Eric Bana and Cate Blanchett who effects a decent southern drawl. It's a decent film that walks a tight rope of violent action flick and something that would find a home on the Nickelodeon cable channel. Although I liked it, I thought the PG-13 rating was a negative.Ronan is great as Hanna. They had her made up almost like an albino with bleach blond hair and eyebrows and a very white face so her character comes off strange to start.Her sense of wonderment and unease, with a world she had never seen before she left her home in the isolated woods in Finland, is honest. She transitions into different languages with ease. She does have problems dealing with other people she meets as she travels to meet her Dad in Berlin. Some of those problems are played for a touch of comedy like when the Dad of the British family she hitches a ride with asks her about her mother and Hanna is blunt when she says that she died. The Dad asks what she died of and Hanna is blunt again and says ""Three bullets.."" Cate Blanchett does a good job playing the villain Marissa. The character has an obsession with having clean teeth as a couple of scenes show and she deliberately picks out a certain pair of shoes from her closet that is full of them. Nice character touches.One of my usual favorites Olivia Williams is the Mom in the Brit family Hanna tags along with. She has some nice sweet scenes with Ronan. The world aware, and celebrity obsessed, sister in the Brit family, Sophie, played by Jessica Barden is a nice teen contrast to Hanna. The scene I liked was when Sophie finds Hanna dispatching a couple of goons that were hired to capture her. The girls share a glance with Sophie's face showing fear and Hanna looking sad while still fighting the two bad guys.The other thing I liked about the film is some of the techniques used. I liked the cold open with Hanna hunting then when she kills a deer the title suddenly appears then the rest of the titles are shown during the next scene back at her cabin. You had a lot of steady cam shots during the fight sequences and the locations for scenes looked unique.If I had one complaint, it would be the PG-13 rating. The action sequences were still pretty violent but being PG-13 you never saw the actual death move or the person dying. A gun would fire then there would be a quick cut away or a quick cut to the surrounding area and you would hear a shot or many shots. The only death they showed completely was the most bloody when Hanna slashed a bad guy's throat but then he didn't die immediately anyway.I know they used PG-13 to try and draw in tweens (I can see the merchandise tie-ins now), but we had an eleven-year-old vigilante in 2010's Kick-Ass and that needed to be rated R.Aside from the rating the film was entertaining and I see great things in the future for Saoirse Ronan.",Hanna
159,engelst,Badly directed,4,3 March 2016,"I would have liked to enjoy Hanna. It's the type of story I have a weak spot for. An unlikely underdog with a secret past and unsuspected strength.The movie wants too much and achieves too little. The story has many small and big incongruities and atmosphere killers. Why for instance would a pursued secret agent hiding in the woods for more than ten years have a little red button available to push so his detractors can immediately know where he is?The actors are great, really such a pity that they had to end up in this dead-born movie.The locations are varied and for the most part beautiful. The movie is filmed very awkwardly however, making the film look amateurish, like a student project. It all looks cheap and lacking in action.I had to force myself to keep watching because the second half becomes repetitive and the story reveals too many weaknesses.",Hanna
160,Reel_starz,If Jason Bourne went indie...,8,16 April 2011,"The entertainment industry has always reflected the current trends and mood of society. Regardless of how often people accuse studio executives and media moguls of being ""out-of-touch"" or ""blinded by greed"", the truth is, the endless barrage of sequels, remakes and updates as well as the million-dollar marketing campaigns upon which many film-makers hang their box-office hopes stem not from Hollywood ignorance but from a combination of recent cultural developments: one, the meteoric rise of technology and the world as a whole; and two, the burning thirst for escape from reality and adversity. Hanna, Joe Wright's dark, kinetic thriller starring Oscar nominated actress Saoirse Ronan as a teenage assassin, feels bizarrely evocative of the contemporary atmosphere, fusing post-9/11 cynicism with rapid-fire editing and streamlined action. Despite his previous resume, which includes such meditative Oscar-bait dramas as Pride and Prejudice and Atonement, Wright proves to be the key ingredient in this weird piece of artsy escapism, finding a comfortable balance between thoughtful and energetic, somber and pleasurable, ultimately crafting a diversion of the highest order.Hanna's opening scene, following its young protagonist hunting a deer, sets the tone for the rest of the movie: urgent yet surreal. In fact, the very first shot – that of a blank snow-white screen – is among the most memorable, oddly powerful in its simple, unexpected vividness, five seconds of pure, static calm preparing viewers for the ensuing mayhem. This single frame exemplifies Wright's ability to instill even the most seemingly innocent and unassuming moments with menace, a lingering and quietly unsettling feeling that something isn't quite right, that danger lurks just behind the corner, and even more than the fast, relentlessly kinetic action sequences, this is what lends the movie much of its resonance. Much like Kevin MacDonald's State of Play or the ever-popular Bourne trilogy, Hanna is essentially a run-of-the-mill thriller elevated by the palpable confidence of its director (not to mention the competence of its cast). For almost two hours, Wright submerges his audience in a tumultuous, almost dream-like world of shady intelligence agents, clandestine government projects and vengeful assassins, crafting one startling revelation and nail-biting set piece after another, all set to an exhilarating, pulsating soundtrack by The Chemical Brothers. So drenched with adrenaline and suspense are the proceedings that even the more subdued scenes involving Hanna's relationship with a happy-go-lucky Australian family feel fast-paced and kinetic; among other things, Wright manages to gracefully integrate the film's two radically different plot lines, the touching coming-of-age story and the straightforward revenge thriller. The movie does not quite hold up under close scrutiny, but like a good roller-coaster ride, it's fun while it lasts.For the most part, the actors hold their end of the bargain, providing solid-to-good performances that further distract from the preposterous plot. Of the supporting players, Jessica Barden, offering a bit of comic relief as Hanna's precocious new friend Sophie, and Olivia Williams, exquisite as Sophie's cordial, easygoing mother, are the most noteworthy. The only major flaw is Tom Hollander's performance as a crooked mercenary hired to eliminate Hanna, a morsel of grandiose over-acting that sticks out amid the otherwise discreet cast like a polar bear in the Sahara Desert; even Cate Blanchett, playing delightfully against type as ruthless CIA agent Marissa Viegler, exhibits considerable restraint (and a warm Southern accent) in a role that could easily have been caricatured. Her quietly explosive brand of menace serves as a functional counterpoint to Eric Bana's jaded, vaguely sorrowful determination as Hanna's haunted father, and despite spending only a few minutes on screen together, their volatile chemistry, best shown in a tense scene in which he breaks into her hotel room, is riveting.Nonetheless, it is really Saoirse Ronan, the title heroine, who holds the movie together. Hanna, a teenage girl trained by her father to be a bloodthirsty assassin, mirrors several other violent women that now populate pop culture, including Hit Girl (Kick Ass) and Lisbeth Salander (The Millennium Trilogy), yet Ronan transforms her into a truly unique character, primarily by removing all pretension and focusing on real emotions. Although capable of defeating three adult men in hand-to-hand combat and a superlative marksman, Hanna is far from invincible: she experiences all the uncertainty, verve and despair of a normal adolescent, and Ronan, arguably the most promising actor – male or female – of her generation, expresses this angst with subtle poignancy and unmistakable compassion. A (worthy) Oscar nominee for her acclaimed turn as a devious aspiring writer in 2007's Atonement – also directed by Wright – Ronan is known for playing seemingly innocent girls with dark, even sinister, undertones. With her down-to-earth demeanor and ethereal looks, she displays a maturity and poise rarely seen in actors her age (or, for that matter, any age), inhabiting even the most complex and unsettling roles with steadfast aplomb; it comes as little surprise that she has elicited numerous comparisons to Kate Winslet, who dazzled audiences and critics as an up-and-coming actress in the '90s. In Hanna, perhaps her most difficult role thus far, Saoirse Ronan displays similar promise, her nuanced portrayal lending the character both realism and sympathy. Make no mistake: Hanna may be a professional super-soldier, but Ronan makes her completely, heartbreakingly human.",Hanna
161,EyeDunno,Hanna Didn't Miss the Heart - She Acted Spot-On,8,4 August 2011,"The opening scene of Hanna - set in a cold-bitter wilderness in which Hanna hunts for food - truly set the pace for what comes next: 111 minutes of well-paced action in which the story still takes its time to unfold why everything is happening, and what the motivation is for the choices made by the primary characters.Saoirse Ronan embraces the character of the 16-year-old Hanna. While she was trained well enough to leave her remote home life, she has more than enough eye-opening adjustments in the 21st century to deal with because of her father's failure to teach her more about the nuances of the outside world. Hanna chooses to enter the world of Cate Blanchett's character, Marissa, which is even colder than the environment that Hanna leaves. Marissa is unapologetic as she seeks her own resolutions and the two leads weave their paths to an inevitable conflict. Isaacs, played by Tom Hollander, seems more playful than deliberate in providing background support, which adds some welcome levity to an otherwise disturbing tale of operatives tracking down a teenager. Marissa's father Erik, played by Eric Bana, is the one character I feel didn't have enough back story to understand. Perhaps that was the choice of the filmmakers. Maybe that might have detracted from the film's intent, which was to provide a solid plot in which they give you just enough time to pause to see where you are, before following another fast-paced chase scene. Added props go to Jessica Barden, who plays the young teen British tourist. I feel that she does quite well sharing the spotlight with Hanna. Her accent is a bit heavy, but she and Hanna make choices that, I think, any teen might do under the circumstances they are dealt with. The musical score by the Chemical Brothers is a great accompaniment with the editing and production. I enjoyed the cinematography by Alwin H. Kuchler. It doesn't seem top-notch, but his style is decent. I felt a bit of drawback on how the camera was tumbled on a couple scenes. It detracted from the story because suddenly, I forgot the chasing and had to deal with being taken for a spin. There was no need to do that, except perhaps, for wanting to do something different.",Hanna
162,jmc4769,Ronan saves the movie,5,8 April 2011,"This is a movie people will probably love or hate. The best thing about it is Saoirse Ronan, who is very believable as a teeny-bopper version of the bride in Kill Bill or Alice in Resident Evil (except in her fight scenes).Beyond Ronan's performance, there is not much to like, in my opinion. The biggest problem is that the movie veers too far towards surrealism to be a good action movie. If you like that kind of thing, OK, but just know what you're getting into. Director Joe Wright seems to have thrown logic and realism out the window in favor of style and just plain weirdness. To give one example: Ronan's character escapes a CIA facility through a manhole only to find that she's in the middle of a vast desert. She slips back down into the tunnel just in time to avoid several Humvees speeding directly over her. Never mind the unlikelihood that the Humvees would be in just that spot at just that time--what sense does it make that they would drive right over the open manhole without noticing it?The sound track is a loud, in-your-face combination of odd music and strange sounds. This type of soundtrack together with periods of seizure-inducing light flashes and quick-cut editing make the movie difficult to watch at times.I also take issue with the fight scenes. They weren't that convincing--Wright, Ronan, and the stunt crew don't make you believe that a slim, less-than-100# teenage girl could overpower three strong men with her bare hands. And where were the guns? CIA agents, ex-agents, and thugs don't fight hand-to-hand unless absolutely necessary. In any number of scenes, one of the protagonists could have easily killed or captured the other just by pulling out a gun.Oh well, maybe this wasn't an action thriller after all. Maybe it was just a fairy tale, as some other reviewers have suggested.",Hanna
163,Targe,A complete surprise 'Bourne Identity' type film - incredible!,10,6 December 2011,"I will be very disappointed if that young Irish actress Ronan does not claim best actress award or at least a nom for Oscars this year.Much like Ron Howard's daughter in The Village, this young girl completely steals the show, leaving Cate Blanchett and Eric Bana feeling flat footed and outclassed by the amazing young talent.Everything about this film is amazing - from the stark and fairy-tale like beginning in a mysterious northern forest (part of the fun of this movie is just figuring out where the heck the characters are - as a dazed and confused young assassin hanna wanders into a strange desert market, it takes us a few minutes to realize she is in ........ :)) The music is top-notch, a constant pulsing rave style that keeps your nerves on edge and ready for the next twist.Ronan's fight scenes are another top-notch, easily on par with those in the Bourne Identity, which this film feels very much like in delivery.Perhaps a little miscast and poor choices in villainy are the only places this movie falters. Cate Blanchett as the aging CIA assassin boss just doesn't pull off here - she comes across as a somewhat dowdy older Gillian Anderson Scully xfiles character, as she is nearly the spitting image of her in the very fake red wig. She never comes across as a threat to Hanna, cowering in fear when Hanna's father tries to kill her, yet trying to be deadly in the final scene against Hanna herself.The villain, a crazed sex-twisted neo-nazi, is farcical and one wonders what the director was thinking. A team of neo-nazi assassin thugs are hardly the unobtrusive counter-hit men the CIA would dispatch, and really, do those even exist?? But Ronan is really the shining center piece in this completely new take on the tired old 'femme nikita' role, as a child assassin kept completely isolated from the modern world until her release, we share her terror and frustration over ordinary things like electricity as she tries to keep her killer nature a secret, while openly yearning for love, acceptance, and a real family.I HIGHLY recommend this movie to all who loved the Bourne Identity. I think this is better.",Hanna
164,iReviewFilms,Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: Hanna,7,1 May 2011,"Hanna is not only the story of a girl who you would definitely not like to meet down a dark alley but also one of discovery as she learns to live in the real world away from the restrictions and rigorous regime that her father has bestowed upon her.The story begins in the forests near the Arctic Circle where Hanna (Saoirse Ronan) lives with her ex-agent father Erik (Eric Bana) in solitude, hunting the animals and being trained by her father for a greater purpose that is kept from us. After they activate a homing beacon, US marines flock to their house where they can locate only Hanna. They take her in for questioning to a top secret base in order to discover the whereabouts of her father but find that Hanna will only speak to Marissa Wiegler (Cate Blanchett) the head of the operations (with her own agenda), who she knows by name.This is where we discover first hand the true potential of Hanna as she executes Marissa's double and the guards around her before attempting her escape from the compound. The movie follows her story as she then flees the scene in order to reunite with her father. All the while she is being tracked down by the warped and slightly crazed Isaacs (Tom Hollander).As the movie develops you can't help but feel somewhat sorry for her as all she has ever known is the confines of her father's house and the encyclopedic knowledge that she has been taught as a bedtime story rather than the fairy tales that other children are given. In some ways this is a coming of age story just from a slightly different angle than the norm as she adapts to a world that she finds alien and confusing.Cinematography is hectic with the picture cutting, chopping and changing during fight scenes and supported by dramatic music (given to us by The Chemical Brothers) that adds to the action splendidly. This is then contrasted by long scenes that are shot with no cutting whatsoever which really allows for the tempo of the movie to help dictate the franticness of the action when it arrives. Locations, like the camera work, varies greatly as one moment you are in the wild in the Arctic or a desert before being transported to the urban landscape as a metropolitan city or a city from the developing world.Things that did not quite work for me were the occasional plot holes and slightly unrealistic/unbelievable scenarios that kept popping up- can you grab the underside of a truck moving at 50 mph and still hold on because I know I can't, the poor Texan accent put on by Blanchett who I would have expected better from and I also would have enjoyed just a bit more action during the movie.All in all Hanna is an enjoyable little action adventure that will please on most fronts. In essence it is replicating one of the Bourne trilogy with a 16 year old girl and is not as explosive and action packed as some might expect but Ronan's performance along with a mysterious undertone that parallels the story make it worth the watch.For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com",Hanna

A 1st year film student learns screen direction the first day in class...where was Wright that day? This film had such potential but did not come close to fulfilling it's objective. The acting was fine but the story, camera work and lack of plot lines lost me not far into the film. Sad really...it could have gone somewhere. Why all the spinning camera shots...it was distracting and did not add to the film in any way. Oh...and I hated the music.",Hanna

I really like the actress, watched a couple of her movies, ""lovely bones"" she outstanding, the plot on the movie is ok. But when are idiot movie producers going to realize, you don't need a bunch of idiot scenes that you just through in for the hell of it. As an action movie, it's boring, boring, you don't drag this kind of a movie on and on. the movie should have been at least 40 shorter. and more action.

167,razvan-rogoz,A bit disturbing,9,21 August 2015,"Hanna is not your usual ""teen turns spy"" movie. There are many of those and most are suited for a 13 - 14 yr old audience.Hanna is a movie that wants to be mature and succeeds, in most parts. It covers some themes that me as an adult make me feel uncomfortable (entirely due to the fact that the lead is a 14 yr old, at least in the movie) and keeps you on your toes.It is one of those movies that tries as much as possible to not be politically correct. I don't want to spoil it to you but believe me, there are no deus ex machines in this movie, no last minute save, no last minute miracle. Bad things actually happen and while it ends on a bitter sweet note, it is not a happy ending.There are a few plot devices that are used for the sake of making the movie longer but these are the only faults I've seen. And as far as the editing goes, it could have been improved but it is decent.Hanna is the kind of movie that can disturb and keep you interested in the same time. And most importantly, there is no black and white in this movie, no clear concepts of good and evil, but rather a more realistic, dramatic approach that most movies lack these days.So if you've seen ""Barely Lethal"" and you've wondered why have you've wasted 90 minutes of your life, this is on the exact opposite of the spectrum.",Hanna

I've got to write this review because I'm so angry that this movie wasted my time and money.Hanna is FULL of so many stupid plot holes and ridiculous impossible acts that it is a farce - and the producers of this trash are just laughing at the audience - all the way to the bank.There are literally several dozen points in the movie where you are snapped out of enjoying the show because nothing like that could ever happen in real life. No character would do what the actors in this movie did.The absurdity of so much of the ""action"" in this movie made me check the history of the screenplay's writers - and one has never written anything else, and the other has only written ONE other TV show.And that should be some warning to you. It will certainly be something I will consider when I research the next film I'm trying to decide about - and whether it is worth spending my time watching.I can't even find the words to describe how angry the plot holes in this movie make me.

171,bigcalkenobi,Interesting try at a spy/survival tale but ends with mixed results,7,7 May 2011,"Hanna is a thriller about a young girl with enhanced abilities, a life of training, and the will to survive. In this Joe Wright film we get to see what is supposed to be a mix of a character story with an action movie that tells a tale of a girl trying to survive. The movie sports a solid cast lead by Eric Bana, Cate Blanchette, Tom Hollander, and Saoirse Ronan. What sets this movie apart from most action thrillers is that it has a very indie feel to it which makes for some interesting results. Can Hanna successfully mix a character drama, an action thriller, and a very unique filming style to make a great film or does the film lack a clear focus because it tries too hard to mix so many different elements?Check out the rest at my film blog http://mastersfilmreview.wordpress.com/2011/04/23/hanna-review/",Hanna

If all the hybrids (for a lack of a better word) had to be 'terminated' and Hanna was the last left, think about this..., here's Kate keeping up with her, in heels! chasing her and Hanna was not able to put distance between them? The point is: If that's all the hybrid can do, WHY does the U.S. have to see her dead? (Obviously, she's not all that bloody superior if that old, British broad is out thinking her! And how do the clockwork orange goons ever find her in Morrocco? Was that the ONLY seedy, little joint in the whole country that the lugs somehow knew that's the one she'd be at? Give me a break.Why doesn't it reveal whether the British couple and their kids were killed or not?

173,stephenrtod,A beautiful film comes full circle,7,10 April 2011,"The cinematography here is exquisite. The lead actress, Saorise Ronan, acts with her face, her body, her ability to use silence and space -at 16 almost 17, she is very impressive indeed. In the movie, she seems more like 13, but the disparity between her pre-teen looks and her Ninja tactics is stunning, frightening and very believable.There were three moments in the film where I wished I had had subtitles. That may be a function of my age, but my hearing is so very good that I hear everything and sometimes cannot pinpoint utterances that are slurred or speeded up.The interplay between the three principal actors is choreographed admirably: Eric Bana, Kate Blanchett and Saroise Ronan behave like forces of nature grappling with each other in this Darwinian tale.The bad guys are really nasty, cunning, and sadistic - inexorably pursuing this little girl.The plot seems like a ladder: Each event is a step toward greater intensity, more challenging conflicts, more opportunities to reveal character.I'd like to see it again, with subtitles, once the DVD is released; but it is the kind of movie I will also see again on the big screen, for their is no substitute for that kind of panoramic view, and this is the sort of movie that really deserves to be seen in an I-Max format.It is not common for a feature film to display the sort of unity and coherence that Joe Wright's film manages to exude. The movie does not glorify blood, gore or gratuitous violence, but it is a violent film, delving deeply into the dark side of extra-legal assassination, counter-insurgency, and the idea that children are pawns in murderous adult machinations in the world.",Hanna

What we get instead is something exceptionally rotten. Okay, the idea of a girl trained to be an assassin has been done before -- specifically under Luc Besson's guidance (La Femme Nikita, Leon the Professional and recently Colombiana) and these have all in one way or another been extremely polished and entertaining. What we have in Hanna is a bargain basement ripoff that stinks to high heaven, has plot holes the size of Texas and appears to have been made on a budget of twenty dollars. EVERYTHING is predictable, the dialog is dopey as hell and the ending is duh-duh-dumb. OMG was this movie bad! If the teenage assassin is so deadly then why at the climax is she pursued by two half-witted street thugs and an effete nothing in tennis gear who couldn't mug an old lady in a back alley? Give her a worthwhile adversary, not three nothings who would jump at the sight of their own shadows. When the climax of the movie is the non-revelation that the heroine was conceived as part of a deadly warrior program (say, what? Which moron on the writing team threw this idea into the mix?) then one gives up all hope entirely -- if indeed there is any hope left -- not that there would be for any discerning film enthusiast. How on earth did Eric Bana and Cate Blanchett ever get involved with this tripe? Did they have an empty space in their schedule? Did they figure it would go straight to video and never be seen by anybody? Please, please, don't waste time out of your life watching this hogwash.

176,trixie-k-88,Disappointing,4,4 March 2012,"Hanna was an interesting concept of a teenage girl who was trained by her father in the arctic to be a super-assassin. Unfortunately, this interesting concept turns into a big let down.Hanna, played excellently by Saoirse Ronan, is a skilled hunter, fighter and killer. She has had no human contact except that of her father (Eric Bana), and has been trained to be highly intelligent, vigilant and look at things without emotion. She has been trained so vigorously because, as her father says, people will want to catch her. When she is sent into the world, his warnings prove to be true, and Hanna is forced to fight and kill. On her journey to escape Hanna encounters a girl her age, and begins to travel with her family. While with the girl's family she begins to feel some semblance of normalcy and emotion, but that is short lived because she is still being pursued. Thus, more fight scenes and killing continues.This movie is stupid. It's the kind of movie that sets up a protagonist to discover something about themselves, when the audience has figured out that ""something"" about 20 minutes in. Hanna is also depicted as so powerful that there is rarely any real concern for her safety or freedom. Along with that, the motivation for anything gets muddled and confusing. There are some good fight scenes and a decent soundtrack, but there are also some stupid or disturbing fight scenes. As for the conclusion, it is completely and horribly disappointing. It just left me thinkingand NOW what happens?! It left me with so many questions on what happened to Hanna next that I almost wished it wasn't the end of the movie. Not that I enjoyed the movie, but the ending was left so opened I really craved something with more finality.

178,DemiRonin,"Like most action films Hanna suffers from plot holes and a few inconsistencies, but its unique style and slamin sound design will shadow most flaws.",7,5 May 2011,"16 year old Hanna played by Saorise Ronan, has been raised her entire life in the secluded wilderness of Finland. Her father, ex-CIA agent Erik Heller played by Eric Bana has trained Hanna to be an efficient killing machine in preparation for the day she will inevitably have to defend her life. Hanna spends her days hunting, memorizing factoids from an encyclopedia and being drilled in weapon and hand to hand combat.After seeing a plane fly overhead Hanna desires to see the world cannot be contained. She tells her father that she is ready to face Marrissa Wiegler, played by Cate Blanchett, the woman who wants to kill her. Erik, realizing the time has come for Hanna to leave the nest shows Hanna a signaling device. After she flips the switch agents will come for her and the two will have to separate until later rendezvousing at a safe house in Berlin. Hanna flips the switch and is willingly captured by agents. Entrapped in a concrete fortress Hanna kills what she thinks is Wiegler and escapes the compound to meet her father in Germany. With no money or resources Hanna joins a British family traveling through Europe. The daughter Sophie instantly bonds to Hanna as she teaches Hanna the social aspects of friendship and cute Spanish boys. However Wiegler is still alive and sends a special team to capture Hanna while at the same time trying to neutralize the rouge agent Heller. The film Hanna is unlike the stereotypical action film. Although the film has its chase scenes and killing it also works on developing Hanna as a girl longing for tenderness. Hanna doesn't know what it's like to live with electricity, to have a friend, or to have a romantic relationship. All she's ever known is the harsh life of the forest with her father constantly berating her to become stronger, quicker and more ruthless. Through the film Hanna start to learn that life has more to offer than just killing people. However it's a little ironic that Heller saved this girl from the cold blooded Wiegler only to mold Hanna into a merciless killer herself. Hanna doesn't contain the most satisfying of endings and characters like the family and the strange magician at the safe house seem to drop in and out of the film ever so conveniently. Also the mystery as to why Hanna is being raised in the woods is fairly unoriginal but the soundtrack by the Chemical Brothers and the shooting style make Hanna fairly exhilarating to watch. The performances from all three of the main characters are terrific. Blanchett has the evil step mother down pat and Ronan amazingly shows instances of emotion while maintaining her stoic persona. Hanna, the dark fairy tale of a female child-assassin is a pleasant hybrid of action and art house.Who this film is not for: -Old people who can't take hard electro music",Hanna

Not to say that Hanna was a bad film, I enjoyed it, but that the trailer is a little misleading.From friend's opinions and my own, after seeing the trailer, we were expecting a horror, although thriller was admittedly nearer the mark.Hanna is a girl brought up by her father in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by snow and woodland. Trained to be a ruthless survivor she finally gets to an age he can't hold onto her any longer and must let her go to face the world, which it turns out is out to kill her.She is caught and escapes, which is the main action of the movie, then the rest of the film is a coming-of-age type tale of Hanna exploring what it's like living in a world she's never known before, our world. The way she reacts gives way to some standard comedy and her tale is interspersed with the continuing movements of those out to get her.As they eventually catch up with Hanna she leaves her first friend and her family toward the end of the plot, which involves some more action and some drama, leading to a final showdown which sees Hanna deny her trained instincts to kill, only to affirm her ruthlessness with an execution which ties neatly to the film opening for effect.A good film, but that ruthless child we see in the final second of the movie, would have been a more exciting tale considering her portrayal in the official trailer of the movie.

It is loud, odd and far-fetched, resembling the Bourne Identity on drugs. This trip of a movie has plenty of action but it's the feel and characters that fail for me. A poor cast includes the albino like Ronan (Lovely Bones), the pouting gingered Blanchett (Elizabeth) and ill placed and sounding Bana (Hulk flop) . It's bizarres simply did not impress me, as admirable as the film is.Hanna, is a 16 year old girl, trained in the snowy woods by her father, an ex top CIA op, to be a lethal fighter. This is all to avenge her mother's death and deliver revenge against the CIA boss who crossed them. The twist towards the end surrounds Hanna's identity and future. Hanna is a great, simple idea, delivering fast paced action once it gets going. However, with ambitious over thought out locations and unlike able characters, the film fails to live up to its excellent soundtrack and billing. Maybe for me it was just simply the cast, but my feeling is there are far better action-busters that have come and set the bar far higher than this teen-girl revenge escapade.",Hanna

183,jamuckley,Hanna is a suspense-filled thrill ride that has a 16-year-old teenager handily taking on the CIA who seeks to destroy her very existence.,8,21 April 2012,"Hanna is a suspense-filled thrill ride that has a 16-year-old teenager handily taking on the CIA who seeks to destroy her very existence.Check out my full review here: http://reelstorymovies.blogspot.com/2012/04/hanna.htmlHanna (Saoirse Ronan) has grown up in the wilds of Northern Finland, north of the Arctic Circle. She lives with her father, ex-CIA agent Erik (Eric Bana) in a small cabin where they train, hunt and practice self- defense until the time is ready.As any teenager might, this special girl feels like it is finally time to move out and to learn about the real-world for herself. Her father has a special ""mission"" for her in this new life of independence. Some of the plot as to why he would come out of hiding and risk exposing his daughter to be apprehended by the CIA with the possibility of her death, and while she is completing the mission, Erik has his own mission in which they will ultimately rendezvous at a set point in Berlin, Germany remains to me a mystery.My biggest qualm with this film has to be plot. All of these unanswered questions and reasoning as to purpose is where I get caught up. Erik has spent his whole life plotting and planning with some great endgame in mind, but as a viewer, that endgame never really comes into focus.He has been for years and years enslaved in his cabin in the nearly uninhabitable Arctic and when his daughter finally wants to be free, he devises an elaborate plan for that to happen, but his methods seem completely ridiculous.It does, however, similar to the conclusion of the Bourne Identity, have an opening to expand the film into a franchise of multiple films. Hanna did seem a lot like a teenage girl Bourne Identity. It has the aspects of the CIA, a secret program, a cover-up and a rogue agent all working together eerily similarly.The CIA in the film is the enemy and the head of that threat is Marissa (Cate Blanchett), Erik's former handler. She has been hunting Erik down for years and when the plot to finally be free begins, she is the first person made aware of Erik's tracker being initialized. Blanchett struggles mightily with a Southern accent she employs as an agent. It was really bad and ditching it altogether would have better serviced the film. Marissa is a worthy adversary for Hanna and Erik as she methodically seeks to destroy them and everything they have left.Visually, Hanna is excellent. It's delicious eye candy from the stark white of the Arctic to the bustling streets of Morocco. Director Joe Wright employs alternating black and white images to create a strobe effect throughout the film. Wright's captivating chase scenes are especially brilliant. Many of them are on foot running to get away from danger, to escape a high security holding facility or to outrun an assassin. The film's hand-to-hand fight scenes are another added bonus to the fast-paced thriller. The Chemical Brothers score also provided a huge boost to the overall feel of the film.Hanna is a vicious, emotional teen who is dangerously lethal. The action of the film accentuates her power.My score – Overall Rating: 7.5 out of 10 Plot: 7 out of 10 Character Development: 7 out of 10 Acting: 7 out of 10 Audio/Visuals: 9 out of 10",Hanna
184,i-spookie,Wanted to check out a young Saoirse Ronan,10,7 December 2020,"....and what didi I find - this masterpice. Not as a film per say, but definitely Ronan as the actor she has become and always was. So many sour bellied reviews on this film, so many know-it-alls, so many false premises for writing a review. Forgetting what a performance this girl gives. So be it. This is Ronans film and I just love it.",Hanna
185,scarletheels,Not for action junkies looking for a quick adrenaline fix,6,7 March 2012,"Hanna Heller (Saoirse Ronan, Atonement) lives in solitude in the Finland wilderness with her father, Erik (Eric Bana), an ex-CIA agent. For the past 16 years, he has been training her to be the perfect assassin. She is a skilled hunter and fluent in many languages but she longs for the outside world. Realizing that she is finally ready, he gives Hanna a transmitter box which she uses to dispatch her location to Marissa Wiegler (Cate Blanchett), another CIA agent. Leaving his daughter behind, Erik sets out to Berlin where Hanna is to meet up with him after she has killed Marissa. She's captured, taken to Morocco, and interrogated by a double for Agent Wiegler. Believing the double is the real Marissa, Hanna snaps her neck and flees from the facility, but not before getting her hands on classified files about her own DNA. An intensive manhunt for Erik and Hanna begins. You should know that this isn't your typical action film fueled by crazy spurts of adrenaline. No car chases through busy streets, superhuman stunts, or fiery explosions. In fact, it's more of Hanna's coming-of-age story - her first real friend, experiencing the power of music and dance after wondering about it for so long, encountering technology and electricity after a decade and a half of kerosene lamps, being with a boy. This is a bit of a Euro Art House film so if you're looking for a movie like Salt, you'll be vastly disappointed. As a David Lynch fan (director Joe Wright cited him as a major influence), I give Wright props but The Chemical Brothers score is invasive at times. As a stand-alone soundtrack, it is freaking awesome. What Daft Punk does for Tron doesn't always work in Hanna. Take Hanna's escape from the CIA safe house in Morocco, for instance. The blaring track and flickering lights are enough to put the average person into a rockin' epileptic seizure. Recommended to those who have the patience to let their tea steep but not to action junkies looking for a quick adrenaline fix.",Hanna
186,MrJRGO,A curious and intriguing film.,8,9 May 2011,"An incredibly intriguing and captivating film that sees a mature performance from the young Saoirse Ronan, ably assisted by a host of well known faces like Cate Blanchett, Eric Bana and Tom Hollander.The film revolves around a teenage girl Hanna(Ronan) who has been trained by her ex-CIA father(Bana) to become the perfect assassin. However, the time comes when she has to fight for her survival by setting out to defeat her enemies.Saoirse Ronan plays a very compelling lead in this film. Portraying a girl who is almost super human with an astounding amount of knowledge, yet incredibly inexperienced in the ways of the world is no easy task. I'm happy to say she delivers a very credible and likable performance. She ably communicates Hanna's emotions in a cold unemotional way, if you get my drift. After all, she has been brought up to be the ultimate assassin. She isn't a bad person, but she doesn't feel pity.Cate Blanchett is convincing as a CIA operative who is devoid of any feeling towards other people and Tom Hollander plays an almost humorous part as a hired killer, the like of which you rarely see these days. I found his character of Isaacs to be truly repulsive, yet almost as fascinating as Hanna herself and would love to know who he based the portrayal on.Hollander's role adds realism to the film. His character is very believable and real because he is too outrageous to be a hired killer in a film. This aspect of realism in ""Hanna"" is also enhanced with the involvement of a travelling English family. It helps cement the fact that this is really happening that, in a world where families go on holiday, a young wide eyed teenager can be a supreme fighting machine. This isn't one of those ridiculously absurd Hollywood popcorn movies about super kids. This feels real.The film spends time in several parts of Europe and is shot in a reassuringly basic way, again enhancing the realism of the scenario. The soundtrack isn't particularly grand and there's no call to the President to save the day. There's no bravado here, just a strong and compelling story.This is a stimulating and novel take on a subject that Hollywood would usually spoil with over dramatic fight scenes and unnecessary explosions. With a modest budget, this was money well spent.",Hanna

What was the plan??!!"") ... that's when the movie starts getting worse and worse.I want to rant out all the nonsense, the stupidity of the story, the poor psychology of ALL the characters, the ridiculous ""danger"" of the main antagonists (even in reality those dudes would've EASILY been taken care of with some basic combat skills), ... but many 1-to-5-star reviewers have already done a great job describing the vast foolishness of the plot.",Hanna

191,nyshrink,Underwhelming,6,18 April 2011,"I entered the theater thinking that in the worst case, it would be a good action flick and in the best case, something truly original and memorable. It was an average action flick and neither original nor memorable.This film takes a tired sci fi premise, the human with unusual abilities from a science experiment, and tries to make it original by making the main character a teenage girl. It isn't enough. The movie is basically a chase scene. Hanna is on the run to confront and presumably kill the CIA bigwig who started, then terminated the science experiment. The scenes of CIA skullduggery are laughable, less believable even than ""Salt."" There are a few moments of humor and the visuals are interesting. There's a detour of sorts in the plot when Hanna befriends a family on vacation. This is the most interesting part of the movie. Then the film reverts to the chase scene that is its plot line. I thought that the ending might be some sort of surprise or revelation, but there was none. I had the impression the screenwriters might have thought they wrote a funny or ironic ending, but they did not--it just fell flat. I will say I enjoyed looking at Eric Bana in wet underwear, and the Grimm's Fairy Tales theme park was intriguing as a set for some of the final confrontations.",Hanna
192,Schnayblay,"A Decent Film, But Not My Cup of Tea...",7,21 April 2012,"Going into ""Hanna"", I wasn't really sure what to expect. I had seen the trailers, but didn't really remember them. All I knew was it was an action flick about a girl who for some reason is being chased by the Government. And it turns out, that's about all the motivation for the plot you're going to get when you watch ""Hanna"".Hanna is a teenage girl who's been raised by her father in the woods of Finland. She's spent her whole life living like an Inuit; hunting for her own food, making clothes out of pelts, and living in a wood shack. Her father, Erik Heller, has been training Hanna her whole life for the day when they would try to escape back into society. Hanna decides that that day has finally come, and thus starts the real movie. I say real movie loosely because I enjoyed the beginning of Hanna more than I did the rest of it.Hanna runs across Europe trying to get to Berlin to meet up with her father. Along the way, she tags along with a travelling family from England, and Hanna connects with their teenage daughter, Sophie. I really enjoyed this part of the film because it's a way to show how new everything in the world seems to Hanna, and in that it's very effective. There's a hilarious seen where a guy goes to kiss her and she Kung-Fu flips him onto his back. Stuff like this are the things I loved about this movie.Now the rest of the film, with the spies and the espionage is boring. Cate Blanchett plays Marissa the main spy chasing Hanna and her father. I hated her character. She has this annoying southern accent, she's really not threatening at all, and overall she's a villain you really don't care about.Now, Saoirse Ronan, on the other hand, as Hanna, was stellar. I thought she did a fantastic job. I believed her character completely and I loved how Hanna was developed. I really saw a strong resemblance to Katniss Everdeen in ""The Hunger Games"". For one, they both hunt with a bow and arrow. That just already connected them. Both characters are from very low standards of life. And both characters, by choice, leave the comforts of their home to go to this new world that they have no knowledge about, and the whole time it's a pleasure to watch them discover things about these worlds. Another thing both characters have going for them is how the actresses who played these roles were able to pull off a double-sided character. They were able to play both the charming teenage girl side and the bad-ass killer side. And when an actress is able to do that, she is incredible in my books. Just a funny little connection I saw.Eric Bana is supposed to be the main star-power in this film, but he doesn't get enough screen time. At least, not for his character to develop. He has two action sequences, and in both of them I couldn't help but make some type of verbalization like ""Ooh"", or ""Damn! That must have hurt"". That's one thing I did enjoy about ""Hanna"" was the action sequences. When they do happen, it's awesome. My only gripe with them is they end too quickly. There's one action scene that I think filled out its whole potential, while the rest leave you wishing for something more.Overall, I thought ""Hanna"" was a good film, but honestly it just wasn't for me. I'm not denying that ""Ya, this is a good film"", I mean it's directed well, the writing is good, the acting is good, but I just didn't like the final package it was all delivered in. It felt like the script needed another working before going into production. I can easily understand why someone would love this film, but it just wasn't what I wanted or was hoping for. I say check it out, but you're either going to love ""Hanna"", or be disappointed.",Hanna
193,FFAxDAVID,cool action flick with heart,9,5 June 2011,"Am not sure why it appeals to see a young teen beating up professional thugs twice their size, but it does.The DNA explanation as to how she does it leaves a bit to be desired, but ignoring that the story is well told, the music playing as it follows the action is excellent, and apart from the goofs mention on IMDb i loved this film and highly recommend it. Classic villains, exciting action, excellent acting, great score-you wont be disappointed if see this movie even if you do manage to find holes in the plot as its just very well made and fun to watch from beginning to end, and leaves itself open for a sequel without making itself necessary should they wish to make one.",Hanna
194,jmcfrancis,Almost perfect,9,28 December 2011,"Many movies face the daunting task of balancing style and substance. Most prefer to stay happily on one side with just sprinkles of the other, while some boldly try to walk the line. The problem with that approach is you only need to make a few mistakes for your vision to fail.Hanna makes very, very few mistakes. Thinking back it is hard to pinpoint where it falters - and this is a good thing. The story keeps a good pace, the mystery builds - even if you figure out what is happening (and it isn't hard) - the fight choreography is great, the camera work is stunning (in particular one scene involving Eric Bana), the locations are unusually good and the script is clever, funny and menacing. Cate Blanchett makes for a great villain as a megalomaniac spy handler and the lead, Saoirse Ronan, keeps us swooping from regarding her as a woman and a girl. Look, if you don't like films with a European tinge to them (Taken is an example), then Hanna will not appeal to you. But if you do, go rent this now.",Hanna

A 13 year old supposedly DNA engineered super soldier teenager who never seen electricity or computer before suddenly knows how to look online in Google to discover her own identity through blacklisted DNA engineering projects. Her ""supposedly"" father go to all the trouble to train her, and then meet her at an run down apartment block and that's it? WTF? It makes absolutely no sense at all.I don't feel sorry for Cate Blanchett and Eric Bana, because they are obviously idiots who actually got involved in this monumentally retarded project so they got what they deserve.",Hanna
196,rosanna-83335,Nice images but that's about it,3,16 April 2021,"Yet again disappointed by a film that had potential.Ayoung girl brought up by her father deep in the frozen forest of somewhere not sure where where he teaches her to basically become a killing machine who can speak god knows how many languages but lives with no modern commodities. This until one day she wants to live her life in the real world.Now this is for me where it all starts to go south, and yes it is at the very beginning. To do this the father who was part of the US CIA or other secret forces, digs up a location box that once activated will signal their presences to his old agency. Now this would be a logical thing to do if you wanted said agency to find you but he doesn't. On the contrary. The whole film is about how he hand her do everything they can to get away from this agency. So please explain why call them in the first place? He got to civilisation just fine without their help. They could have easily just re-entered society in secret and created false identities for themselves and voilà.Then there is the fact that despite the fact he knows that she will be pursued by these people, he doesn't think to tell her the truth about her origins? I mean she isn't the type of kid that would have freaked out, specially as if he had told her really young she would have been stuck with him and ju learnt to live with the truth.Then there is the fact she is formidable at close to close combat and yet she runs away from the woman when she could have easily killed her in the Grimm's house. I actually think she could have taken the three bad guys and saved the Grimm guy. For someone who isn't meant to feel much fear and was trained to be a killer she sure isn't very good at it.Oh and then there is the fact that she just tells the first girls who's nice to her her whole plan. She is meant to have been trained like a real pro. This includes not giving away secrets no matter if the girl you've known for 3 days says she's your friend. I mean if she did go and work for the gov she would make a pretty pathetic soldier.So afilm to be avoided.Oh one positive' the scenery was lovely.",Hanna

198,swowen-84128,Baby faced assassin,8,6 May 2020,"Well 9 years ago today, this movie hit the cinemas in the UK. The movie is an Action Thriller in-which we see a 15 year old girl called Hanna (played by Saoise Ronan) being trained in the arts of hand to hand combat, in the knowledge that she will one day be ""Ready"".
So her father Erik (played by Eric Bana), is an ex C.I.A. Agent, that has taken himself off the grid when Hanna was just a baby. He sets up in the wilderness of Finland, where nobody will ever find him or Hanna, and he is able to bring up his daughter and set her on a program. Hanna's program as she grows up is to be able to survive! So Erik teaches Hanna all the skills that she needs to be that trained assassin. One that will one day track and attempt to eliminate Marissa Wiegler (played by Cate Blanchett), who is also a C.I.A. agent. She used to work alongside Erik before Hanna was born. Hanna is aware of the objective and trains hard, becomes fluent in many languages, has great strength, stamina and becomes very intelligent, not only with the arts of combat, but also academically. She is aware of facts and how the world actually works, but without ever seeing another human other that Erik. When Hanna gets home from a hunt, Erik gives here a tracking beacon, which will alert the C.I.A. of their location. Erik says to Hanna ""when you are ready, just press this switch and they will come"". By them he means the C.I.A. and Marissa in particular. As Hanna is sure she is ready, she flicks the switch! The plan is now active and sure enough ""they come"".
So why does Erik want Hanna to kill Marissa? Well, as the story unfolds all the secrets of Hanna's mother do come out. Does the innocent looking deadly assassin complete what Erik has trained her for? Why does the C.I.A. want Hanna?
I do like this movie and the concept of the trained teenage assassin works very well. In parts the action is slower, but it needs to be to allow you to take in the story-line and how it is unfolding. In other parts it is much faster, with good fight scenes.",Hanna
199,BaiNst,A Fairy Tale Without Rhyme or Reason,4,22 April 2011,"If you read other reviews of this film, you will undoubtedly come across some mention of it having the tropes of a fairy tale or myth, but it does so in such an awkward and shallow fashion, that it only helps in making the film a disjointed mess. I can't help but think that an inept producer took this over in post-production, because there are still some seeds of a good movie that try to shine through, but ultimately the characters behave in such odd and unexplained ways (odd is fine, if it is explained) that anyone who doesn't just turn their brains off when a movie begins is going to have a difficult time walking out without feeling robbed. Asking for suspension of disbelief is not a license to ignore the most simple human logic, nor to have character behavior turn on a dime...and this film begs your suspended disbelief for more than a few character inconsistencies, in addition to the usual list of ""yeah, right, that could happen"" stuff. In effect, they got the first rule of fairy tales down pat: sacrifice all other considerations in favor of having the story develop as you wish.If that is appealing to you, or doesn't matter to you, you will enjoy this movie very much, as it does have a lot to offer to anyone who likes to feel and not think.",Hanna

201,aegiswiz-accede,"Hanna, OK, but not up to the hype.",7,30 May 2014,"Spoiler! Actually I'm not sure, but I don't want to be exiled for making that mistake. I might reveal too much, but there's really nothing terribly specific that I can see.The image of Hanna, with bow and arrow, the front image for the movie, and the promise of the excitement like that of The Green Arrow (Arrow on CW), or Catniss of Hunger Games saga fame suggests that this is a good fit for the lack of great and dangerous young women on the screen lately. Could Saoirse Ronan be the next Angelina Jolie? I liked the premise, the whole ""taught to be awesome warrior"" thing, but I didn't get the premise for the rest. It's no that is doesn't make sense, I just don't understand why someone would take such a great idea and turn it into your average chase scene drawn out for better than an hour. Why? Why? There was so much to work with! Yeah, I like a good deal of the action but I really was a bit let down overall.Don't misunderstand, a rating of 7 is a movie worth watching in my book, but where I would watch every episode of Arrow (on CW) and have read all the Hunger Games books, and watched the 2 movies (so far), I'll not be in this one for a re-run.Along the way there are some interesting 'reveals' that were unexpected, but with hindsight there were a few hints to all the reveals along the way. It is in the reveals that beg for a sequel. I don't really know where to go from there, but there is absolutely a sequel and if I were writing it, it would be better than the original. I'd go for something along the Borne Identity range of ideas, toss in some awkward romance and it's a hit.I did like the conclusion. If you watch the movie it will be anti-climatical, and when it comes you'll know exactly the dialogue and actions that are to come, but I liked it anyway.",Hanna
202,FanPerspective,"'Hanna' is a smart, face-paced thrill ride that will get you exhilarated",8,9 April 2011,"You either adapt or die in director Joe Wright's newest action flick, Hanna. Growing up in the secluded forest of Finland with her father (Eric Bana), an ex-CIA operative, Hanna (Saoirse Ronan) has been raised to be the perfect assassin. Now, 16-years-old, she is sent out across Europe by her father on a mission and must elude the CIA agents targeting her, led by ruthless agent, Marissa (Cate Blanchett), who carries a secret of her own. Aided along by an electrifying soundtrack composed by The Chemical Brothers, this smart, fast-paced thrill ride gets you exhilarated. In a day and age where we see countless remakes, Hanna is a breath of fresh air in its originality. And aside from being the very definition of badass, the story also conveys the message of growing up with heart and dark humor. The events that occur throughout the film are made that much more compelling by the directing and editing choices, which are just mesmerizing and unique; quick cuts and spin shots mixed in with the lighting are just beautiful to watch and enhanced greatly by the soundtrack. There's no way you'll be disappointed with this film as it delivers quite the punch!",Hanna

The movie itself is a bold mixture between art-house and action- thriller. It has a constant weird undertone of a fairy tale - the Story of Red riding Hood comes more than once through ones mind.The acting is really good, especially Cate Blanchett as evil cia-operative agent and her henchman, played by Tom Hollander, where a delight to watch. The camera work and the pacing is masterfully executed. There is a seemingly unedited one-shot-take in Berlin, following Eric Banas Character from a Bus Station down to a near Subway Station, where he then has to fight a couple of agents...

204,llVIU,"No depth, feels unfinished",4,13 June 2018,"I think google managed to create AI with more character than Hanna. It's like Hanna doesn't have a brain at all... she seems so shallow and from another planet. And of course, she's a 40 kg who can easily take down guys 3 times her size. Because in every action movie, the main character has to be someone with super duper kung fu skills.We barely get any story behind characters... no clever action sequences, nothing. and there WAS room for hanna to act all amazed at society, but no. It seems like she fits perfectly into a society that she has never even SEEN before in her life. No consistency, no explanation, nothing. Lame as hell. Ending is crap and unfinished. I bet the script for this movie was less than 3 pages.One good thing about this movie is that it makes other movies like the matrix, seem so much better in comparison.

I came out thinking ""I should have seen the other film"".Hanna starts off promising but ends up being silly, with no rhyme, no story, no purpose. Instead it turns into a maddening dash at times and drift off to sleep boring at others... I liked Blanchett's performance but Bana (one of my favorite actors) was...so and so...kind of out of his water it seemed. Ronan was good in her part, except she didn't match her character in what she was supposed to be... a genetic super-human. She looked, as another commenter pointed out, anorexic. Surely someone so well trained and so powerful should have a better physique (??). A lot of close-ups of her beautiful eyes, a lot of concentration on her face and villains who are unconvincing and badly played... a lot of things that don't really make sense and leave big holes in the story...If you are going for the action scenes you will be disappointed, you don't really see her fight, the scenes are so disjointed you get glimpses really but no real action sequence. A lot of things are implied.It's more of a gory coming of age film rather than a spy/action movie...and there is really no twist at the end either, it is all explained during the film. The ending is unremarkable... she gets her target, everyone else dies and we never learn what became of Hanna... the end.",Hanna
206,bmrao1980,An original gem in a field of franchises.,9,8 June 2011,"Simple yet effective. That is how I felt when I left the movie hall after watching Hanna. In this times where studios are increasing banking on probable franchises, this little gem is a refreshing original story that is also very well executed. The acting, the action, the casting, the Chemical Brothers score, the characters, their interaction, the story, and all the twists and turns it takes - all of it is very well and seamlessly done.Ronan, who plays Hanna, is someone to look out for in the future.I will go so far as to say that she might be the next Angelina Jolie in terms of action scenes. She might even go beyond that because she is also a good enough actress, not just an action star. Cate Blanchett's performance as a villain was also refreshing, although her fluctuating accent did take away from her performance a bit. Also, all of her dialogs seem to be half-finished, whether she was talking on the phone or interrogating the family that Hanna befriended. Eric Bana's performance does feel a little wooden, but then he does not have much to do except 'unleash' Hanna onto Merissa.The actions scenes were very well shot and did not look incredulous like the ones in Kick-Ass. I especially loved the long single-take shots that build up the tension so well.Some of the details like the running scenes and the way Hanna's hair is never tied, depict that the director has his own unique sense of style and has used it quite effectively here. Also, the girl-girl kiss does not look gratuitous at all, but rather a good signifier of how grateful Hanna is to find a friend.There are always going to plot-holes and unanswered questions in every movie but the pace, the acting and the action never lets those come in the way of enjoying the movie. In fact I think some of it was deliberate so as to let the individual's perception fill in the blanks.All in all, although I might have used some exaggerated prose in here, the movie left me satisfied overall. We need more original gems like this one. I hope there is no Hanna-2 because it is perfect the way it is!",Hanna
207,prateak09,high expectation in drain....,6,22 June 2011,"The trailer held so much promise, but this really is a half-stinker half-brilliant film about a child assassin that goes from preposterous to intriguing to ludicrous to thrilling.Hanna is the story of a teenage girl who has been brought up by her father figure in isolation. He has trained her to fight, survive and kill. She decides to leave and sets out on a mission they have been planning for years, to kill the woman who has been hunting them.Although this type of film has been done to death it is an interesting story which had it been developed better then would have made a fantastic film but it just falls short on all fronts. Even the fight sequences are slow and boring. There are also a lot of plot holes. One for example, and most noticeable, Hanna is frightened by electricity, TV, phones. which is natural since she grew up in some cottage without any gifts from modern civilization but she can enter a netcafe and browse internet immediately.However, some of the details like the running scenes and the way Hanna's hair is never tied, depict that the director has his own unique sense of style and has used it quite effectively here. Also, the girl-girl kiss does not look gratuitous at all, but rather a good signifier of how grateful Hanna is to find a friend.Ronan, who plays Hanna, is someone to look out for in the future. She's an amazing actress. Cate Blanchett's performance as a villain was also refreshing, although her fluctuating accent did take away from her performance a bit. Also, all of her dialog seem to be half-finished, whether she was talking on the phone or interrogating the family that Hanna befriended. Eric Bana's performance is fine, but then he does not have much to do except 'unleash' Hanna onto Merissa.All in all, a disappointment. I rate it 6 out of 10 for the beautiful cinematography, the background score and Saoirse Ronan's performance.",Hanna
208,arus_royus,An uneducated opinion,6,28 August 2011,"Call me simple if you like ;). Statement: The movie is (inadequatley stated) trash. One moment she is in Arizona (Morocco doesn't look like this, second point there aren't huge underground American air bases in Morocco) next she is in north Africa. Also the story is pointless and over dramatic. Visiuals and camera movement and the soundtrack are quite gripping, though. It might have made better in a Sci-Fi setting. Also it is physically impossible for a girl of such a light frame to have this kind of strength... Anyway, each to his own. Also it wasn't that entertaining P.S. Littl girl obsessions...some directors just have them.",Hanna
209,gareth-91,Hmmmmm,6,7 May 2011,"I liked Hanna's character & I liked her friendship. But really, her dad didn't prepare her - poor wee soul. It was quite dark. An awful lot of unnecessary killing -- completely gratuitous. What really worried me was that it was a 12a. This should have been a 15.Cate as a psycho CIA person was scary; and I did feel real warmth to Hannah's character. But overall I didn't really get it. It was quite flat for me, I expected to come out buzzing, but I didn't. Possibly I was empathising with the poor wee lass who obviously didn't have enough warm fuzzies in her life.I've been told this isn't long enough, so I'd better say something else. Hmm, let me think. Was it meant to be shocking that children can be so violent - all you have to do is go to some tough housing estate and you'll see that level of violence from children; so no surprises there. Actually I found a lot of bits quite boring and too long. Hopefully this is now long enough",Hanna
210,lestatbesa,"Fairy Tale-ish, Odd- Action Film You Want to See",7,4 August 2020,"As I watch this film, I already observe the unconventional treatment of this film in term of color toning. It is same as you watching a fairy tale-ish approach movie this film but it is an action film. Makes me feel it is a modern fairy tale movie with action-pack thrilling twist. The progression of the story is a bit inconsistent there is a high and low but manage to put a high marks on some scenes. The fight scenes well-choreographed but expecting more on the climax which it felt flat but got its mark. The location choice of filming is astounding. Marissa (Cate Blanchett) did a good job in this film, she is a wicked witch in this film and Hanna (Saoirse Ronan) is the princess. Another highlight in this film is musical score, I love how the tension build up by its sounds. It makes me feel that I am also part of this movie.",Hanna
211,ibarix,I really don't know what to think about this title,5,16 September 2011,"I really can't see why this movie has better score then Sucker punch. It's kinda boring at times. Long gypsy dance comes to mind and there were too many drama scenes so I think at least 20 minutes could be cut off. The pace is often too slow. I thought this was supposed to be action movie, not drama. Compared to Sucker punch - no thrill, no fantastic CGI, no great fighting scenes, no pretty girls...The idea is good but the pace is just putting you to sleep. With good idea like young girl trained to be an assassin I thought this movie would kick ass. Unfortunately, it doesn't. If you have nothing to do, watch this. It's pretty forgettable movie to me.",Hanna
212,andriz,ridiculous,1,14 July 2011,"This is not even a movie. This is like watching over a teenagers shoulder, how he/she plays the most stupid video game ever.Little girl running. A gay man (respectfully) - with yellow sports dress, little beerbelly, x-legs and dyed hair- chasing him, as a governments top assassin. He has two employees helping - one is underaged and underweighed skinhead kid, the other is obviously his older brother. All of that being orchestrated by red-headed evil woman/agent, who gives orders to anyone, but does'nt have any superiors of his own. On her way chasing the girl, he has to kill girls father, who was once one of the top assassins as well, and they meet their grande finale at some adventureland. Redhead gets killed of course. The end. In the mean time assassin-girl met a young boy, who tried to kiss her and got his ass kicked instead and a girl (friend) - who got a little gay-flavoured kiss instead. That's it.You can bet my word, that I added much to the characters here and real ones are even shallower. I also boosted a plot line a bit - real one is even more stupid. So if you still feel you have to see that masterpiece - you are totally worth it :D",Hanna
213,Queer-qatfm,"Absolutely perfection from the acting, setting, and score!",10,28 August 2011,"I can just imagine American audiences will describe the film as follows: You know that woman from TNT's 'The Closer?' Well she's after this albino girl and her father who was The Incredible Hulk who are these ex-spy assassin types.And while that is a valid way to give the synopsis of what this movie is about, it completely missed what Hanna is. It's a super-rare wide release of a Euro-thriller that places its entire weight on the acting talents of a young Saoirse Ronan. She's already not been seen in films such as City of Ember and Lovely Bones (Both of those films bombed). But here, given such a juicy role, I'm completely and utterly blown away by this girl. While we've been closely following another vicious girl, Chloë Grace Moretz, Let Me In was an unnecessary remake and Kick-Ass was gimmicky, though pretty good. Ronan's Hanna is the real deal bringing a stunning combination of innocence and superhuman skill to her ballet between discovery and demolition.This movie, where Hanna is raised to be a stone cold killer in the snowy tundra, eventually turns into largely one long chase. And it's on this basic level I find the only faults with how this all unfolds. Fortunately, along the way we're treated to Hanna's attempts to make friends and enjoy things she was denied in her remote tutelage. These scenes bring so much passion for life and character, they are not to be missed simply because they lack the action promised in the trailer. One in particular where Hanna and another young girl share an evening flirting with some Spanish boys is filmed with such admiration for the moment, I was almost giddy at such earnest passion for the story.While I absolutely cannot believe this thing is getting a wide release, what with its non-American focus, a plethora of subtitles, and largely bloodless PG-13 rating, I couldn't be more pleased. Yes, there is a LOT of plot, and sometimes the chase does get tiresome. But just when I think I'm starting to fall behind, there Hanna is again filling most of the screen with her presence. Or a particularly disturbing German bounty-hunter. Or Kyra Sedgwick lookalike Cate Blanchett barking out something sarcastic in a lovely southern-drawl.Hanna works on so many levels, a study on parenting, a portrait of a wild child in civilization, or a straight-up action flick, it would narrowly miss perfection. But then I'm reminded of The Chemical Brothers driving the whole thing via their soundtrack. (Did they get jealous of Daft Punk's Tron accolades?) So, yeah, I think I'm going there.",Hanna
214,briant-6,Chaotic mess,1,2 January 2014,"There's no way this movie merits a 6.8 rating (as of January 2014). Someone's stuffing the ballot box. While other reviewers have admired certain technical or musical aspects of the film, they sometimes use language that implies an undue familiarity with the film's production. The premise is initially interesting, if confusing -- a father raising his daughter in the wilds of Artic Finland to be self-sufficient. But it degenerates rapidly into incoherent nonsense. While it's logically a chase movie, the tension winds up with Hanna's capture but then wanes, yawns and dies as we wait for Hanna, her father Heller, and their nemesis Wiegler to get it on. Hanna, while supposedly prepared by Heller to kill Wiegler in revenge for having murdered her mother, is utterly unprepared to cope with the 20th century. She also completely lacks social skills and is largely incapable of having a coherent conversation, typically useful skills if you want to get by as an assassin. Perhaps trying to reflect Hanna's inner turmoil at the overwhelming stimuli resulting from 20th century technology, the film is at times also extremely chaotic with fast, confusing cuts. The film is better edited at other times, but none of it hangs together. As others have noted, Heller mysteriously leaves Hannah at the cabin where she is captured. Heller then periodically reappears for reasons that aren't readily obvious and don't contribute to the plot in understandable ways. In one instance, Heller swims across a vast body of water, climbs onto a pier in his skivvies, and as two police appear, the film cuts away, leaving the dramatic moment unfulfilled. Only later is it revealed that Heller killed both policemen. In another example of the nonsense, Wiegler visits Hannah's grandmother seeking Hannah's whereabouts. The grandmother has been around ever since Heller went underground, but she can't offer any information, and Wiegler nonsensically murders her. Hannah and Heller are mysteriously reunited at her dead grandmother's home, and when the bad guys show up, these two expert killers split up and run. Given Hannah and Heller's background, it makes no sense when they flee enemies when they could have easily dispatched them. In the end, the film is unable to sustain disbelief and utterly lacks coherency and a worthwhile story.",Hanna
215,jfwhelan,"A Very absorbing story, but there will be questions",8,5 June 2011,"My immediate reaction after watching this is ""Wow!"" This a is roller-coaster ride of a film and most of it is the fast paced downhill and tight cornering part, though there are one or two necessary breaks when the roller-coaster climbs to it's next peak.The film is well made and the acting is impressive. Saoirse Ronan is a revelation in her role. She played the part of an all knowing ingénue to perfection and in so doing displayed a detached and innocent beauty that was never coy or knowingly sexual. I believed, it that she could have told the hotelier in absolute detail how the light worked, yet found the actuality of its working almost magical. As can be inferred from the above,I very much enjoyed this film. I particularly liked the way the director allowed the film to unfold without those overused ploys that add false tension and maximise the embarrassment of certain encounters. Hanna was not embarrassed by her ignorance or mistakes and it was right that we were not lead to be embarrassed for her. The levels of tension and menace occurred naturally with the plot and worked. If I have any problems with this film, it is with the story. There is some exposition as the film progresses and we do glean a certain understanding of the immediate focus of some of the characters. However, we never really get to nail the underlying motives and reasons and we certainly never get answers for some of the important questions. I wanted to know a little more about Hanna by the end and was a little let down by the way the film just stopped, as it did. Maybe there is to be a sequel: there is certainly room for one. I don't usually look for parallels or possible muses when I watch films. Sometimes, however, they come unbidden to me. When watching this I find definite parallels somewhat obviously, I suspect, to 'The Bourne Identity' and perhaps less obviously to 'Blade Runner'. And like 'Blade Runner' we have a pretty good idea who the 'baddies' are, but we never really get to decide who the 'goodies' are. I just hope that like 'The Bourne Identity' there is more to come.",Hanna

217,patrickmbrame,"Expertly directed with a strong cast and compelling story, Hanna is an entertaining, thrilling movie topped off with a kick ass soundtrack.",8,18 April 2011,"Expertly directed with a strong cast and compelling story, Hanna is an entertaining, thrilling movie topped off with a kick ass soundtrack. Hanna, tells the story of a father and daughter, Erik and Hanna, played by Eric Bana and Saoirse Ronan, living just beneath the Arctic Circle in a secluded cabin where Erik has been teaching his daughter how to survive, kill, and think adaptively, basically how to be an assassin with the ultimate goal being to kill Marissa Wiegler, played by Cate Blanchet, a handler for the CIA. The motive behind why they want her dead is kind of part of the interesting storyline so I don't want to go to into that, but that's the basic premise. We are led on a journey with Hanna, uncovering truths about her past and seeing what it's like in the real world being a teenage girl, all the while being hunted.The direction by Joe Wright was some of the best I've seen and I love that he chose to do an action movie, and stepped away from his drama period pieces like Atonement or Pride & Prejudice. If anyone else had filmed this story it would have been a straight forward CIA action spy movie with stereotypical, simple, action shots. With Wright though, he takes an action movie and mixes it with fairy tale themes and these beautiful masterful shots creating a movie that is unlike your typical CIA spy movie. On top of that, his action scenes are very well done, they're not loud or explosive, instead he's in the character's face with the camera while they're in hand to hand combat, and on occasion he'll do this all in one shot making it that much more impressive and real.The cast is excellent and is strongly led by Saoirse Ronan, who is and will be a huge talent in the next few years. She plays Hanna extremely well showing her vulnerable and innocent side while also being this bad ass teenage girl. Eric Bana plays an integral part to the story, but he really isn't shown enough to be an interesting character and his acting skills are kind of put to waste here. He does however have one of the better action scenes that is all one shot. And finally, we have Cate Blanchet, who I really don't have to say much about, she's always going to be great and she especially shines in this role. Marissa Wiegler is pretty much seen as a wicked witch but with a strong sadistic, almost psychotic personality, making her a really fun character to watch on screen. Not to mention she has an obsession with her teeth, like has her own personal dental equipment obsession. It looks like she just had a lot of fun playing her which always makes the performance that much better.Bottom line, Hanna is a pretty good time at the movies and does what it should. It never really dives to deep into the characters or the storyline itself, but shows just enough to keep you entertained and glued to the screen. I would have liked to have gotten some more background information on Erik and Marissa particularly, however by not doing so we are placed in Hanna's shoes and feel how frustrated and scared she is enhancing our audience experience. Personally, my favorite part of the film was the music, done by The Chemical Brothers, making every scene that much more fun to watch, and this was definitely evident during the action scenes. You can get a taste of it during the trailer, but it doesn't totally do it justice when compared to a whole chase scene. Wright turned a basic CIA story with a few mysteries into something that is fun, intriguing and different than most other spy/assassin films and one that I highly recommend going to see.",Hanna
218,jbe-6,"Fairytale, complete with wicked witch and evil goblin...",10,15 December 2011,"I found Hanna to be an unusual, thought-proving, beautifully acted and excellently crafted film.It's a fairy story. All the clues are there, the fairytale book, the wicked witch (Blanchett), the innocent young girl alone in the woods except for her troubled father(?). There are gingerbread houses and one point the witch emerges from the big bad wolf's mouth.Fairy tales are often violent. Cruelty abounds and Hanna takes elements and moves the traditional story to a modern thriller setting, complete with CIA assassins and a rogue spy master.Then there's the music. It's wonderful. The Chemical Brothers match the pace and direction with a slurry of wonderful electric sounds. There's a classic hook tune called ""The Devil Is In The Details"" that the goblin (the exceptionally creepy Isaacs, played by Tom Hollander) whistles constantly to himself.This is one to watch. Don't miss it.",Hanna

And the editing is annoying AF, like half the time it's part music video style editing (that'll make you vomit, if you're lucky) other half is like an art movie with some nice shots, but they totally irrelevant to the story.Hanna is supposedly being hunted by CIA, but they're never really close to catching her, so there's an acute lack of action in this movie.Seriously, I don't even want to waste more time of my life writing a too long review of this stinker of a movie.If you want to be entertained, I strongly urge you to look elsewhere, this ain't worth your time.",Hanna
221,deborahjwood,Sad waste of 30 million bucks!!!!,4,6 August 2011,"I am still struggling with the reviews of this film compared to the actual film: ""action thriller""; ""top notch performances""; ""beautiful cinematography""; ""outstanding score""; ""amazing movie"" -- were they watching the same film I watched or had they just toked up a big fat doobie? And to give it a high 7 in a forum where the average GREAT film is an 8.5 and The Godfather only ranked a 9 is bewildering to me. The acting is mediocre at best and Blanchett would not get a billing in Hollywood if this were the only film on her resume, really, how much acting skill does it take to have a blank starched scowl, speak in monotones and let off with an occasional wicked witch laugh for two edited hours? - The Morrocan crowd scenes are better acted than many of the star scenes – Ronan is not bad for a young actress but when you have the scorching talent of children like Abigail Breslin and Dakota Fanning to compare the teen with – even she is mediocre – again by comparison – all wide eyed and expressionless – maybe she's afraid of needed a face lift if she moves her face too much? Even the much talked about scene where she is introduced to the modern world with fans, television, lights, etc. it's contrived and not her acting – it's the flashing from image to image, more the camera loving her than her loving the camera. That same scene brings me to the sheer extraordinary unbelievability of this flick. An ex CIA operative is going to raise a girl to her teens in the frozen tundra then abruptly drop her on a techno world? A) with that kind of stupidity he would never have made the CIA and B) expecting us to believe it is equally far fetched. Lots of little things from her dragging an 400 pound reindeer with her 85 pounds and clothed in 50 lbs of dead animal skins -- to her escaping a highly guarded CIA facility (deep underground in Morroco of all places) with nothing but her golden locks and a hideous orange jumpsuit – no fore knowledge of the building plans, no weapons, no backup and any assassin in training would know to lose the long hair – too much to grab onto in a fight, to that amazing homing device that works without power and on a 14 year old Energizer battery??? Oh my the list is just too long suffice it to say you will have to do a LOT of ""overlooking"" to get through this film.The score is obnoxiously booming screeching and repetitive and barely passes for techno just awful in the in the context of the movie although it MIGHT be okay if not attached to a wreck of film.The editing looks like it was done by a 5 year old clips, bits and pieces throughout the film and I know it was designed this way to give it an artsy feel, to endow its action sequences, to give the audience a feel of anxiety and excitement but it fails so miserably that you almost have to feel sorry for even the behind the scenes artists. Now I am not going to spoil this for you just in case you have absolutely nothing better to do one day and your best friend just dumps this DVD in your lap for you to watch but the movies only salvation is the plot twist involving Hannah's mother and her being raised by Bana but you gotta endure 2 hours of this grueling film - a cliché script, a God awful score, mediocre acting, atrocious almost psychotic filming to get there but the last 15 minutes IS perhaps the one piece of solid acting by Ronan in the entire film. I just find it impossible to believe this was TWICE on the list of the best unproduced screenplays in the industry in 2006 and 2009? – I'd love to read the original screenplay because those responsible for putting it to film were on some serious drugs.I am being over generous with a 4 but I have definitely seen worse – so painful to watch",Hanna

Saoirse ronan is completely useless as the lead character and Cate blanchett is a ridiculous cartoon. What i think must of happened is that the producers and the writer must of gotten the idea that because of the very warm reaction to HIT-GIRL in the movie KICK-ASS, that they thought lets go ahead and make a movie about this ,but it just doesn't work out in this case because who ever made the film, is not very good at their job.As for the good reviews on here for this film, they really do make me wonder about humanity, as in how can you put such rubbish in front of people and still make them lap it up??Anyone who gave this a good review is a mindless automaton who does not know a real movie when they see it, they need to go and become a proper connoisseur of all types of movies and then think properly about the nonsense that is Hanna.",Hanna
223,wildwesth,German Expressionism meets Ghost In The Shell,10,13 December 2012,"Wow! Let me say it again. Wow! Must see this film.There isn't a frame in the film, a moment of dialog or music that is anything less than a sheer joy to behold.Joe Wright and Company have woven together a simple fairy tale, wrapped it around a coming of age story of a young innocent girl, with all the bizarre twists and bloodshed we expect in modern action films.Like Tron Legacy, John Carter of Mars, Lawrence of Arabia and Metropolis, you can only enjoy the sheer genius of directing, cinematography, production values and writing if you suspend disbelief in the real world and go for belief in the characters. And they are wonderfully portrayed.This is an adventure! A beautiful story! And a lesson in the harshness of the real world.It is a poem, a love-story, a Christmas gift.Like the beauty of visiting a national park, you have to sit quietly and let it unfold on its own classic lines.At times you think you are watching a story about a little girl from the 1960's, or a story from the 1700's filmed in the 1960's.But no, it's actually a story about today, shot through the sentiment of German expressionism.Is it Little Red Riding Hood? Snow White? The Accursed Huntsman? Jason Bourne in Wonderland? Or Ghost In the Shell?Hanna tells her father that he didn't prepare her for the real world. But when she takes that final shot, just as she did with the deer in the beginning, we understand that she is fully prepared for the real world...Because she did believe in wonder, and the magic of mastery.What other movie can make a dangerous stroll through the seedier parts of Berlin look like a walk through a fantasy world?An amazing achievement, way outside of current genre. Something new, and yet something classic.And the film is set up for a sequel, which we wait for with the Hanna's child-like wonder.",Hanna
224,nikpathak,Second hand Kill Bill meets first hand Babylon AD,6,9 June 2011,"The title ""HANNA"" on the screen instantly flashes the Kill Bill"" look and you almost sense a Quentin Tarantino movie written all over it...and... it ""almost"" delivers!!Hannah tells the story of the girl(not exactly with super powers but genetically 'advanced') who, after living her whole life in the woods, is set upon the world which sets in motion a man hunt by a CIA agent. While the storyline may be similar to Babylon AD, they both are wholly different films, with Hannah, just a bit superior one. But Hanna somehow successfully balances Bourne-style action and a Tarantino type action – thriller. Coming full circle with ""I just missed your heart"" and shoot style the beginning and end come together in a way that feels similar, but is done in a satisfying way that somehow helps to savage the incomplete storyline... though not completely.The only thing which comes in the way of being a really good movie (for which you need a Tarantino to get the story nailed to the sheer quantum of action going on), is the average storyline - a derivative of many other films including Universal Soldier, Resident Evil, etc. For no particular reason, except to give Hanna a reason to want revenge later on, the mother is killed by Kate Blanchet (the only reason derived would be the failed CIA experiment to have a perfect solider in the form of Hanna gone rouge – of course you don't need to give a reason for why it went rouge') . Hanna really utilizes the two senses you use most while watching a movie to their maximum potential – sight and sound. One of the strong points (and a really strong one) about the film is the visual grammar... which is flawless...Everything just 'feels' right (may be even if not actually). Add to it the fantastic performance by Ronan, proving that when she is put before Joe Wright, she delivers her best (Atonement was better and this was just a tad below it), though you may want to kill Cate at all times for her accent(she is a far better actress than this film – LOTR / Aviator / babel ?).",Hanna
225,Skriptman,Style Over Substance,3,22 April 2011,"The premise has great potential. In fact, the film started out well - sure, maybe a bit of a reach in terms of believability, but I was willing to go along for the ride.However, once the setting shifted from the stark Far North, Director Joe Wright shifted styles. And boy, did he hit the Overkill button. As Hanna makes her escape from the holding facility believing she has eliminated Marissa, the piece ramps up to manic mode. Instead of an engaging thriller, we're suddenly thrust into an elongated music video. Jarring, clipped, frenzied visuals matched frame for frame by an overbearing and relentless sound track. Long tracking shots and bizarre camera angles are inserted into the story without any apparent reason other than for us to see how clever and stylistic the storytelling is....It just doesn't work. It seems every effort was made NOT to support the story, but rather have the story play second fiddle to a smörgåsbord of overdone sights and sounds.And speaking of story, it was all over the place. In one instance, Hanna is awestruck when she first encounters electricity. (She's already seen an airplane fly overhead... but a light that can be turned on and off with a switch? Wow, now that's something!) She's so baffled by techno-gadgets like a TV, a ceiling fan and an electric kettle she sprints from the room. Yet a day later, we find her comfortably and capably surfing the web at an Internet cafe. Hm. Did I already mention it was a stretch? Cate Blanchett plays a driven, idiosyncratic character who may have seemed interesting on paper, but comes across as an over-the-top imitation of Cruella De Vil. Many of the other characters - the British tourists and Issac, the sadistic blond killer Marissa employs to track down Hanna - were equally idiosyncratic and equally uninteresting. Seemed like the writers' ideas for creating character is simply endow them with quirks and disconnects. What you are left with at the end of the film is a feeling you've just spent two hours (tho' it seemed much longer) in the company of unconventional characters who are as engaging as they are charming. They're neither.Saoirse Ronan certainly has a strong screen presence as Hanna. Unfortunately, she's about the only thing that makes this mess at all watchable.It could have been, should have been a much better film.",Hanna
226,chunkmeal2,Hanna is a poor imitation of Jason Bourne,6,27 May 2018,"Basically, Jason Bourne, played by a 15-year-old or so Saoirse Ronan, but less convincing, logical, or entertaining (the pace was often way too slow).The fight scenes involving Hanna were especially unconvincing. The container fight scene at around the 1:14 mark was especially unconvincing and took me out of the movie. The three goons have her, then the teen actress that is Saoirse Ronan grabs and ""tosses"" the goon aside. It was obvious Ronan (try as she might) wasn't exerting much strength (and the actor playing the goon was doing most of the ""self-tossing"").(Reading up on the director Joe Wright, one sees that he specializes in drama pieces and has no experience with action movies. This, of course, could have been remedied by a capable crew, assistant directors, stunt team, etc. but evidently these were not available.)As many have noted here, there was too much left unexplained. Or more likely, there was no good or logical way to explain most of it. This *might* be OK in some sci-fi or magical realist film, but Hanna was (like the Bourne movies) depicted as set in the (mostly-)real world.One small example: At the aforementioned fight scene, Hanna has just easily defeated two of the three goons. The only one left is the quirky, whistling guy who's middle-aged, balding, slightly porky, and doesn't seem especially fit. He is running towards her at a comically slow pace and panting. Instead of just easily defeating him as she should be able to, she chooses to escape by jumping into the water.",Hanna

Pitched as a spy-thriller, I actually enjoyed the film more so for its bizarre blend of genres and tonal shifts.The film starts off with Hanna and her father Erik surviving and training in the forest / tundra and soon escalates to some typical chase scenes, fight scenes, stunt scenes. But the action doesn't quite reach the hyperbolic cheese or machismo of spy thrillers. It's always interspersed with coming-of-age / coming-into-society humour or some other odd bits and ends. But none of these generic categories stays too long. It always seems to be shifting. The atmospheric presentation was fascinating too: it's the kind of film where you can never be sure how perverse or violent it will allow itself to get.The plot is weird and erratic. It's not the strongest part of the film, or why you should watch it. You should watch it because it's A) different from the typical action film, and B) Saoirse Ronan's acting is captivating.",Hanna

The locations and the set pieces are gorgeous. The score is, if you like electronic music, a real triumph. The Chemical Brothers made some of their best music ever for this film. I like the fight scenes, they have an organic flow to them. The 'not great': The script goes a bit wobbly in the third act, which causes it to feel overlong. And that final line and it's attempt at symmetry is a bit cringe-worthy. I can understand why people love/hate the movie. It is smartly stylized, the acting is excellent, and I gave it 6 stars instead of a mediocre 5 because of that incredible Chemical Brothers score.p.s. Saoirse Ronan will be nominated for an Oscar someday. She's that good.",Hanna
230,octomancer,A perennial favourite,8,24 October 2021,"I've watched this film half a dozen times or more and I'll watch it again. For me it's up there with ""Fight Club"", ""The Good, The Bad and the Ugly"", ""The Bourne Identity"" and some others that just never get old.I'm not saying that it's one of the best films ever made, but for my taste, it is certainly one of the most watchable.Saoirse Ronan and Eric Bana deliver and give the film real heart and soul. The supporting cast is full of star turns too. Tom Hollander's pervy assassin is a hugely enjoyable caricature, and Jessica Barden, in one of her first roles, shows exactly why her star is now rising.And that soundtrack ... it's a compelling, atmospheric, psychedelic masterpiece. I have a huge soft spot for the Chemical Brothers anyway, having cut my dancing teeth in 1990's Britain and I'm one of the few who still remember the Dust Brothers, but even so, the soundtrack just works for the film. For me, it's one of the major reasons that this film has so much rewatch value.This film has a huge amount of style and it hits the spot as far as I am concerned.",Hanna
231,didkus,"Coming of age can be brutal, and so can this movie",6,11 March 2019,"Coming of age can also be extremely confusing and more or less fun, and so is this movie. Don't be fooled by the synopsis, this is not your typical CIA/FBI/whatever thriller. It's intense, it's action-packed, yes, but it's also weird and surreal. This movie is original, yet filled with cliches, it's beautiful yet grim and brutal. Surely there is a lot to unpack if one must analyse the ""meaning"" of it all and how it relates to real life. To me at the moment it seems just as meaningless as teenage years tend to be: life jumps at you and you try to survive, and no matter how much you were ""prepared"" for it, it's all a big mess that you'll probably try to forget until the rest of your life.If you are not into weird movies, don't watch this. If you like having neat stories you won't like this. It's not something to pass time, in my opinion, because there is just so much happening all the time. The story, the cinematography, the music, the characters, it's all changing and creating different layers of conflict all the time. It's easier to say what this movie isn't than what it is, so I guess if you are into that sort of weirdness, you have found your movie of the week, or maybe the month.6.5/10 from me for the way it was executed in relation to sound, visuals, and acting, and for bringing a different experience. I would have liked something more in regards to how the characters and the story were developed (weirdness is not an excuse for having no character development, be it one which makes no sense, in my opinion). I am not a fan of using characters merely as symbols, but if you are, it probably won't be a problem for you then.P.S. It reminded me of ""Legion"" (Marvel) but with no character development and worse storytelling. I think ""Legion"" is fantastic, just to be clear about that.",Hanna
232,rubn0,"Good footage, but not realistic.",4,28 November 2011,"This is the kind of movie that bends reality in all kind of ways and doesn't meet its own story in that aspect. Not that I dislike fantasy, but in this kind of CIA movie (combined with some hot science topic of today which I won't spoil) a realistic setting is part of the story (or should be). So, if you are someone that can't ignore all that and can't welcome a maybe some-necessary-own-added illusion to the story, you will probably be like this during the whole thing: ""OMG, and this is so ridiculous, and that is so not realistic, and that is so stretched and what the ..euh..hel?"" .On the other hand, because of the good footage, nice faces, various and sometimes beautiful environments and some variation in characters, this just makes it worthwhile to watch.",Hanna

This is a terrific adventure into a curious underworld and some first class film making.The cameos of the cultures in the countries through which our protagonist passes on her quest offer a delicious contrast to the well paced action and drama, enriching the story though not central to its arc. Performances from Saoirse Ronan vs. her nemesis Cate Blanchett are powerful, the Irish actress Saoirse as the naive but lethal young German girl particularly engaging.",Hanna

And again, and again, and again....I must've watched this movie at least 15 times by now and I still love it. Good story, but even better acting (Good typecast!) and even better music (Chemical brothers).

235,papyrusss-97-239950,Underrated psychedelic action revenge thriller..,9,22 November 2017,"You could easily overlook Anna with it's the vague premise. But you should really do yourself a favor and take the plunge, you won't be disappointed. With an amazing score made by none other then the Chemical Brothers, Hanna is unique, reminiscent of A Clockwork Orange, this movie has some obvious Kubrickian vibes. It's a surreal fairy tale with many references to great works like 1984,Brother Grimm, A Clockwork Orange, Leon: The Professional... It even also reminded me of Run Lola Run, having a sub-themes such as free will vs. determinism, cause-effect relationships.Technically brilliant with a few interesting show of camera work (specially in the perspectives), solid acting... And the sound... The sound alone will drag you in, the Chemical Brothers expertly crafted a soundtrack to match it's atmosphere and stylish cinematography with numerous contrast, landscapes and light schemes. I cannot understand why anyone would give this 1 star. Even if you hate the story, the actors, the themes. The technical prowess alone is worth at the very least a 5.",Hanna
236,browha,Disappointing,6,29 January 2012,"This film starts off in really good form - the trailers make it look fantastic, the premise of it is very interesting, the first half hour or so are really good and set it up really well. But it goes downhill from there. It starts very strong but by the end, you will not be able to tolerate watching it. Its a shame - given the premise of it they could have done many great things.Re-watching it now (not for the first time, either) it looks more like an excuse to get young Ms Ronan out on a free tour of the world rather than any legitimate attempt to make a coherent and decent film that lives up to its billing.Could have been a 9.5, and one of the top 25 on IMDb, instead, for me its a paltry 6, 6.5",Hanna
237,rwdrex,Where's the brain when you need it?,6,10 May 2011,"Now I may sound a little jaded, but I like my movies about ass kicking teenage girls to do more than kick ass. I want them to surprise me with intelligence too.Simple plot summary. A teenage girl (Saoirse Ronan) is raised in the arctic by her ex-spy father (Eric Bana) to be an assassin. She is then sent on a mission to infiltrate the CIA and kill her father's arch enemy (Cate Blanchett). Sounds like it might be cool, right? A classic case of squandering potential.Apart from the opening few scenes where everything kinda clicks, this movie plods on from one illogical character decision/plot point to the next. Why does a teenager who can hunt and kill efficiently and without remorse all of a sudden feel the need to run away from ALL fights after the first 20 minutes of film or so? Why do mercenaries/agents sent to kill these trained assassins leave their guns at home and instead decided to fight it out hand to hand or with whatever weapon they find laying around? How does a girl raised in the wilderness with no experience with electricity somehow manage to access and use with amazing results a search engine at an web café? etc...I have the answer--lazing writing.If the film stays busy enough maybe we won't have time to think about these things--Wrong! The directer (Joe Wright) approached this film with a German new wave style (ala Run Lola Run) and it's cool. The acting by the main three characters is solid with some decent supporting work as well. And the action scenes especially at the beginning work really well. We're just left with way too many holes and inconsistencies to keep the film from greatness.If you can check your brain at the door you might enjoy this film. But if you were looking from a smart thriller like the Bourne films you're going to be mighty disappointed.",Hanna
238,jane_concannon,Awful 'thriller',5,15 May 2011,"My reasons for choosing to see this film were as follows: 1) I am a fan of Joe Wrights previous films Atonement and Pride & Prejudice. 2) It had a good cast - particularly Cate Blanchet and Eric Bana. 3) It had a good score on this site (7.5) and mainly good reviews. 4) I generally like action thrillers. 5) I wanted a good film to take my 12 year old son to. Well.. all I can say is that I was disappointed on all counts. The plot was full of holes, the acting was poor, the music was overpowering, and I found it boring and a little weird. What little pace there was, was killed throughout by slow scenes, such as a 5-minute flamenco dancing sequence, which added nothing at all to the story. Also for a 12A, it was actually quite disturbing in places and I thought it had an unpleasant tone throughout. All in all it reminded me of watching a bad French film. I would say definitely one to avoid at all costs!",Hanna
239,sagrat,Surprisingly good action film,10,15 August 2015,"Who would have thought -- a great action film with a female child lead? But, we kind of had a hint of this in Tarantino's ""Kill Bill"", when we see the genesis of one of Beatrix, the Bride's nemeses, O-Ren Ishii, and in the excellent French film, La Femme Nikita. Where the latter is a more mature person, and Tarantino goes over the top in graphic novel fashion, we have the- excellent Eric Bana as the father-trainer of young Hanna, a true unstoppable human killing machine. Saorise Ronan was breathtaking in her superbly mature portrayal of Hanna. Additionally, Cate Blanchett (with a bit of an odd American accent) give a great job as Hanna's target. A wicked and exciting film. Would love to see what young Hanna has gotten herself into as an adult.",Hanna

It had everything, action, thrills, good background music, a great ending, and great acting. If you want to pick a great movie for an action lover this is the one.(Spoiler Alert) I love how at the end Hanna just goes up to Marrissa when she's wounded and shoots her then it just starts playing the awesome music. But warning, not your average pg13. Most of the action in very bloody. This movie is full of action and over half the movie is action. I've got to say though, any movie featuring Eric Bana is always very good, but the sad part about this movie is (Spoiler Alert) in the end he gets killed.",Hanna
241,jah9000,Action Flick Delivered in Artistic Package,8,17 June 2016,"I don't believe many of the reviewers of Hanna know what the word ""pretentious"" means. If they do, they must enjoy mis-applying it to undeserving movies. What's the pretense? The story is simple. It's not a bad story, it's a basic story. It's neither deliberately convoluted, nor goading in its symbolism. If you can't follow the narrative, maybe Steven Seagal movies are more your speed. Easy-peasy summary (spoiler alert): A government agent involved in a classified and illegal embryonic DNA-manipulation experiment goes rogue when he's given the order to terminate a woman he'd recruited, for whom he'd developed a particular fondness. Rather than follow orders, he gathers the woman and her young daughter (one of the test subjects), Hanna, and attempts to go on the lam. But, his 'handler' intercepts him and attempts to gun them down along an empty stretch of highway. Her shots cause a car crash, but the three escape and run. The mother is finally shot, and the agent and Hanna succeed in disappearing.The agent spends the next 13 or so years raising, educating, and training Hanna. He does this with a mission in mind - a revenge scheme to be carried out when the agent is satisfied that Hanna is prepared and mature enough to decide. The rest of the movie is Hanna's tribulation after setting the revenge scheme in motion. It's sprinkled with moments of self- and world-discovery and some realizations about her father-figure, but it's still just a standard adventure with a heroine facing obstacles and adversaries on her way to achieving a goal. I really don't see what there is to complain about, overall. There are technical faults, and a few moments that were less than believable, such as her grappling the underside of a Humvee coming out of a manhole in a split second. Hello, massive spinal injury. But, it's an action flick about a genetically-programmed perfect soldier. It's supposed to contain absurd near-super- human feats. Is it ""derivative?"" No. Unless every romantic comedy is derivative. Unless every war movie is derivative. It's a formulaic piece, sure, but it doesn't rob another work. It's a spin on an idea. There are all sorts of ways to spin the ""let's cook up a perfect soldier/human being"" idea. From that, we get Universal Soldier, Resident Evil, Captain America, Twins. Four significantly different movies. In Hanna, we get a fifth: ""What happens if the experiment is performed on embryos?"" with the follow-up question, ""What if one of the children is raised outside the control of the scientists/spooks?"" with the bonus question ""Yet, what if the kid is still trained to be lethal in combat?"" and for extra fun, ""What if the kid is a girl?"" All of that makes Hanna quite unique in its flavor. Add in the visual aspects and the Chemical Brothers score - It's just irrational, to me, to hate on this movie. It's certainly not the best I've ever seen, but it's one of my favorites.",Hanna
242,GregClapton,Absolute Worst Movie I have Seen!,1,4 March 2012,"So much hype and promise, but this movie falls very short. The Characters are not believable. The dialogue is impossible to follow. The plot is under developed and chaotic. Hanna's journey is disjointed and implausible. The manhole to hummer scene is impossible. The family of gypsy's is a rip-off of a 60's wannabe perfect family unit, without the drugs. Tracking people without so much as a minor clue is just a fabrication of cluelessness. The audience is left more dazed and confused than entertained. The teeth cleaning scene and tools leaves one wondering maybe Marissa just needs to go to the dentist to rid her of her mean streak. I have always like Cate Blanchett, but this one is not one to be proud of or repeated. Glad I did not waste money at a theater to see this one!",Hanna
243,PhilipVier,Pretentious? Moi?,1,1 May 2014,"How the hell did this film get a good IMDb rating? Why did the critics love it so much? It's one of those films where the director seems more interested in making art, instead of telling a good story. As a result, the whole movie comes of as extremely pretentious and of course, a lot of people feel the need to defend it.In terms of the plot, the film is an absolute disgrace. Saoirse Ronan plays Hanna, a teenage girl who is trained to be the best assassin in the world. Her father is an ex-CIA agent played by Eric Bana. The father and daughter are both wanted by a CIA chief called Wiegler, who is played by Cate Blanchett. As the film progresses we learn that Hanna is a genetically engineered super soldier and that her father took her from a lab. You would think that the CIA would send someone capable after them. But instead, Blachett's character recruits a Peter Stormare wannabe, who operates a brothel; and a useless skinhead who looks like Natalie Portman's character in V for Vendetta. As you can imagine they are no match for Hanna and her father. This is shown in the occasional action scene, where one person is able to defeat so-called expert operatives. There is a huge problem with these fight scenes, which is that they are all done in one tracking shot without any editing. As a result the fight scenes don't make the characters look like good fighters, but more like people with no combat skills at all. I'm very much against shaky cam and fast editing, but in this case it might have made the fights seem more convincing. But in the end it doesn't really matter how good the action is. The main problem is that the film badly written and extremely predictable. In the end Wiegler kills the father, Hanna and Wiegler have a fight, Hanna wins, and that's that.Unfortunately, the acting is just as bad as the story. Eric Bana and Cate Blanchett are both great actors, but in this film it seems that they are only allowed act over the top and speak with horrible accents. I haven't seen much with Saoirse Ronan in it, but in this she is terrible. She's bland most of the time and at other times her emotions are completely unconvincing. The supporting actors give even worse performances. The people who are after Hanna are all terrible, especially the Stormare wannabe. The family Hanna befriends are just stereotypes and serve little purpose to the story. But the worst performance is given by the man known as Mr. Grimm. It looks like they just picked a random drug addict from the street and told him to go completely over the top. It must take a special kind of director to make people act like this.In the end this is just a horrible flick. There are hardly any redeeming features. The film is just pretentious art house rubbish with terrible acting and even worse characters. It doesn't have enough action scenes to work as an action film, and it hasn't got enough suspense to work as a thriller. Maybe there will be a day when people stop defending rubbish like this and see it for what it is: a glorification of bad writing and pretentious directing.",Hanna
244,tamingatche91,An enjoyable action film,9,17 May 2012,I don't want to say anything much on this film so I'll be brief. It was an amazing film in which Ronan owns the stage and quickly pushed her more mature co-stars off it into the audience to watch her shine. She plays an innocent yet deadly character that may make some people uneasy at the violent acts she commits.I enjoyed it very much and it's best you see this film without knowing too much about it but in the week or since I got I've happily watched it twice and it was only better the second time.It may not strike a chord with most people seeing a minor kill people but I'm happy to say it wasn't a repulsive sigh since Ronan performs her action scenes very well.The music gives you a feel for the locations she finds herself in and keeps you tense and excited as she goes on her journey.I hope this was adequate enough for you to enjoy watching the film but it's best you go in blind for this one and avoid any content advisory for spoilers. Please watch this film if you haven't because I'm sure if you have an open mind you'll enjoy it a lot.,Hanna
245,electrablind,Hanna an instant action classic,8,8 April 2011,"thefilmsmith.com Once upon a time in the snowy forests of Finland, there was a girl named Hanna who knew only her father, his training, and their simple cottage. When she came of age, Hanna decided it was time for her to see the outside world. Hanna sees Morocco, makes her first friend, and packs the morgue with baddie bodies.Hanna's coming-of-age concoction of violence and innocence (via sad broken playgrounds and killers whistling kid tunes) is sure to make it an instant classic, next to Leon:The Professional and Unleashed (aka, Danny the Dog). The screenplay by Seth Lochhead and David Farr is a three course meal, serving amusing appetizers, delivering a dramatic duck (with slice of lemon), and action à la mode.The fight sequences, though at times confusingly close, recall the first Bourne film (sans the shaky cam). One scuffle in particular will have you holding your breath, as it uses the long take to build tension rather than just to show off Hanna director Joe Wright did in previous film, Atonement.Such methods speak to Wright's maturation as a director. During the opening sequences he utilizes dynamic shot composition with fluid movements to introduce the audience to the relationship between Hanna and her father; yet he can appropriately shift into faster cuts and stylistic flourish when chases ensue.But these action pieces don't stand alone by the choices of the director and editor, as they're invigoratingly guided by the pumping themes of The Chemical Brothers. The duo lights the fuse and runs, letting their beats and the on screen beatings marry into a pulsating crescendo that will get your blood moving.If it weren't for the development of Hanna as a real girl and not just a killing machine, Hanna would quickly fade into obscurity once the ad team walks away. But by showing Hanna's introduction to the real world (not telling it) and having Saoirse Ronan to play the lost child, Hanna ensures there won't be an apathetic audience. Supported by Eric Bana as Hanna's father and Cate Blanchett as the enigmatic menace Marissa Wiegler, the whole film takes off.It comes in for an unsteady landing in the final act, but considering the rest of the film's accomplishments it's completely forgivable. Along with 2010′s crop of films with awesome female characters (Winter's Bone, Kick-Ass, Fish Tank), Hanna belongs on a watch list for all gals coming into womanhood as well as general action audiences.* We go to the cinema to see something fresh, moving, and amazing. From the stunts, to Hanna's journey, to the little quirks of the characters, this is how action/drama cinema is done, folks. See it while you can because the characteristically lazy Summer Blockbusters are just around the corner -Remington Smith *And don't worry gents, the film didn't alienate this male viewer. Boys have The Goonies, The Sandlot, and The Monster Squad. It's about time girls get some badasses on their side.",Hanna
246,josh_youngbwfc,I Just Missed Your Heart,7,2 July 2012,"Hanna is an American-European action thriller revolving around a 16-year-old who was raised by her father to be the perfect assassin after she is dispatched on a mission across Europe, tracked by a ruthless intelligence agent and her operatives.Saoirse Ronan plays the sixteen year old girl at the centre of the movie and back in 2011 she was nominated for a number of awards, quite rightly, for her portrayal of the assassin. Right from the opening hunting scene you get a real sense of Ronan's acting abilities and you know instantly that this is going to be a great performance from her. Hanna's father, Erik Heller is played by Eric Bana and although he puts on a pretty convincing accent for his part in the film there is something very off putting about his on screen persona; this could be attributed to his character's past but I think unfortunately it comes down to Bana himself (who I am not a fan of anyway after seeing him in The Hulk and being almost bored to tears watching The Time Traveler's Wife). Cate Blanchett plays the villain pretty convincingly, she does seem like someone who you could really hate. And there's a lovely moment where Jason Flemyng decides to pop up and inject a bit of humour into the film that is largely unexpected.Hanna is quite a step away from what director Joe Wright is known for; he previously directed Pride & Prejudice and Atonement. His direction, however, is one of the most interesting aspects of the film. Every shot is clearly well thought through and the film just looks like a wonderful piece of artwork, the visuals are very very good. There is a sequence early on where Hanna, after thinking she has completed her mission, breaks out from where she is being held and her escape is so visually stimulating its incredible, the camera work, the effects: everything is detailed perfectly and it is a very fun sequence to watch. The film also has an underlying theme of fantasy and fairy tale (one of Hanna's only forms of escapism comes in the form of a Grimm fairy tale book) and you really get a sense for that whilst watching. It's not 'in your face' so much but when you notice it it really adds another layer to the film itself.I would have liked to have seen more fight scenes and more action because at some times it did become quite dull and things seemed to take longer than perhaps they should have (Hanna's friendship with the British girl she meets almost seems irrelevant) but when the action did take place and fights happened they were choreographed excellently. Eric Bana takes on four men in an underground car park type place and it is shot and fought really well. As for being a thriller it is good to see the seeds planted for the revelations at the end quite early on but I do think more back story would have been helpful to let the audience connect with the characters better.Overall a very good film, the directing and the acting helps to overcome the sparse action sequences.",Hanna
247,Malgus,Not sure what it was,3,19 March 2015,"I don't know what I was thinking when I picked this... thing. Hanna is one of the most ridiculous films I've seen in a while. It's female Mowgli meets Jason Bourne meets Alice in Wonderland. It's just utter nonsense. It's action, thriller with comedy and drama. It's a two hour mish-mash of absurdity, silly characters, and a few cheesy action scenes. This may sound like fun on paper, but it's anything but. Maybe there is some symbolism there, I have no idea. What I do know is that I had to take several 15 minute breaks from watching, because it was just so damn boring. If you want to see a young girl kicking ass, I suggest Chocolate (2008) with Jejaa Yanin.",Hanna
248,AmandaSage,Hanna makes the perfect leading lady for a perfectly twisted Hollywood fairytale,10,14 April 2014,"Once upon a time in Hollywoodland, a brilliant young actress named Saoirse Ronan re-teamed with her Atonement director Joe Wright to defy boundaries and conventions, and create a new twist on the classic fairytale. The result? A very twisted tale indeed.Hanna is about a lovely girl with big blue eyes and flowing blond locks, who was raised by her father Erik (Eric Bana) in a Finnish forest to be the perfect assassin. Poppa is a former CIA agent with a score to settle. Hanna (Ronan) is grappling with the usual coming-of-age issues facing most young girls who have been brought up in isolation, exposed to the outside world through only Grimm's fairy tales and an outdated encyclopedia, trained to kill without hesitation or remorse, and ingrained with the mantra ""Adapt or die."" When Hanna hits the golden age of 16, Erik realizes she's ready to step out into the world and complete her life's mission: to kill CIA operative Marissa Wiegler (Cate Blanchett). Hanna flips the switch to adulthood—the one that also alerts Marissa to her whereabouts, and brings a torrent of armored gunmen to the snow-covered forest for Hanna's capture—and the story kicks into high gear.As she journeys through Morocco and Europe, Hanna encounters a series of oddball characters, many of whom are distortions of ""classic"" fairytale characters. (One is even called Mr. Grimm.) Through her coming-of-age adventure, she gets her first kiss, makes her first friend and completes her first human kill. In the reverse order. And usually in time to The Chemical Brothers' psychedelic score.Wright clearly had fun exploring how to incorporate fairytale allusions throughout the film. There's an abundance of visual references to support the script, as well as a killer soundtrack. In his trippy and highly stylized approach, Wright somehow manages to make his heroine's peculiar point of view seem normal when compared with the characters and scenarios she stumbles upon. From the hippie tourist family Hanna picks up with, to the manic, obsessive-compulsive Marissa, and especially to Marissa's rogue henchman Isaacs (Tom Hollander), who plays very much like a sideshow ringmaster, nearly everyone Hanna meets on the yellow brick trail full of bread crumbs is a little off.The film takes risks. It throws genre conventions onto the chopping block, then tosses them all back into the bowl to serve up a unique blend of drama and satire, hyperrealism and caricature, simplicity and overkill. A tidily book-ended world of chaos. A bedtime story with bipolar mood disorder.Hanna may be touted as ""a fairytale gone wrong."" But it's definitely a movie gone right.",Hanna
249,xxharrison,Far-fetched action caper.,3,13 April 2016,"An improbable scenario to begin with, it becomes even more far fetched and inane as it progresses. Too much suspension of disbelief is required to account for Hanna's uneven superpowers. She effortlessly outwits armies, adapting to the most varied conditions across continents without prior experience, yet struggles to outpace the cut-price duo sent to track her. There seems little point beyond the actual process of traversing continents. At times it resembles a folksy travel programme, with amiable hippies and Gypsy serenaders, then we're back in a ninja assassin game with shady punks and aimless pursuits. What's it all about? Who cares. The whole thing is risible.",Hanna

He does that again with the varied settings of Hanna. from the forest, to the underground bunker, to Morocco, to Spain, to Berlin and the Grim House - every locale becomes a ""character"" in the film. The story is somewhat conventional, even a little predictable. The story-telling transcends the material to make for a good film. The casting and acting are uniformly good.

Even Eric Bana is a good actor, although his talent is wasted in a handful of mediocre movies. And you know that their careers are are sliding down when they wind up in this idiotic movie.Any movie ought to have a purpose, I could say it is none but then I think the purpose was to indulge someone's (the writers?) fantasy of a frail teenage girl suddenly becoming a killing machine, all of this shown in a mindless action video clip. It is just pointless, ludicrous and simply boring. It reminded me of a very bad episode of any of JJ Abram's series.I don't know if saw too many action movies in my life, that some clichés are becoming extremely annoying to me. The first one is the evil CIA cliché, in which the same agency that could not avert the 9/11 attacks has created with genetic engineering, way before the genome mapping was completed, a perfect soldier. Then there is Blanchett's character, the evil and cold agent that is supposed to be the villain. Well, seeing that Hanna has a borderline, psychotic and anti-social personality, one can wonder who is actually the villain.One that made me laugh is the scene in which a girl that never used the internet is able to easily retrieve clippings from newspapers before the time the internet was widely accessible and that the search engine can precisely give her the link she is looking for.The end of the movie spared us of any implausible twists, but after the foreseeable conclusion, one is left to think: ""Is this all?"".",Hanna

Its cold hearted and slow paced demeanour won't win it the affections of the action-junkie fraternity, but then; who really cares? Hanna is as beautifully bold as Driver, Revolver and Memento and is shot as gorgeously as anything Joe Wright has done before.If you're genuinely into movies that challenge preconceptions and are stylistically innovative then check Hanna out.Anyone with half an open mind will doubtlessly be able to distinguish Hanna's merits.It's a breath of fresh air....",Hanna
255,sankhaonline,Thanks for the nice cheat!!,5,17 June 2011,"Meh!! I thought of giving it lesser ratings. why not? let me explain.This is a story of a 16 year old girl who can speak in many languages, raised by her father in some remote antarctic forest where she kills big dears, never saw electricity, never heard Michael Jackson. only training to combat and building up strength. At night her father reads her some old encyclopedia books. Only purpose of her existence is to take revenge of her mother's killing by assassinating a lady name Melisha.She was rescued from her lonely house and was brought to Morocco, some hidden US military facility. She killed few soldiers and flew from there (so easy!! Even I could have done that!) From here the plot started becoming more juvenile. I think at this point the producer/director thought to lure some PG-13 audience and so they threw in some jokers who tried to act very ruthless. Hanna got company of a stupid lesbian sister and her even more stupid brother and their ""stupidest"" parents. Then the story became more complicated. How come Eric, Hanna's father swim out the whole ocean from Antarctica to Europe? How come Melissa, being a top official from US govt got time, money and approval of any higher level boss to do some wild goose chase in Morocco and then in Berlin? Who is Uncle Grim? What happened to that stupid family? why did these clowns continue doing their cardio by chasing Hanna/Eric/that RV while they have so much man power/ammunition etc? Why now Eric, ... cause Children grew up (the stupidest one liner in this movie), Hanna, who drinks chlorine water from swimming pool, was astonished by a mere tube light, came to a cyber cafe and immediately googled/binged DNA/Eric/chromosome and understood the whole story? (definitely Larry Page and Bill Gates will be happy, but not the viewers) so many paradoxes, I guess they changed the director of this movie at least 13/14 times and the scene editor was sleeping no lesser no of times while preparing the final cut.Apart from some highly qualified camera work, the outcome of this movie is very poor.The action scenes are the worst I have ever seen. The characters are kicking or punching each other in those fake WWF style, at least 5 feet in distance. Acting couldn't been worse.Watch it if and only if you got the DVD free of cost and you have some spare time to waste anyway.But if you are a budding movie maker, you must watch it. Just to learn exactly what to avoid while making your own movie.",Hanna

I just wanted to add that the Director's Commentary is really good and adds to the experience. So if you are fan of this film like I am, this is highly recommended.Every time I see or think about this film, I always feel like this is the one film that truly deserved a second film to take the Hanna character further.",Hanna
257,josh-rimmer-1127,Should have a higher rating,8,27 March 2014,"This movie is very good, and how it has only achieved a rating of six point eight is incredible. It isn't an all out action film that forgets story and concentrates on numbing your mind with explosions and gun fights. Instead this film has a much more stylistic approach that makes the action in the film look and feel even better. The dialogue is good, the directing, very crisp, while Saoirse Ronan throws all she has at her character with great effect. All the supporting cast are great (especially Cate Blanchett's evil antagonist), and at the core there is even a great feeling of humanity. Some of the editing might lag with the incredible pace of the film and in some places even feel forced but all that aside, the film holds itself up firmly with the support of it's great cast and script, while the director Joe Wright, pushes the film throw the final hurdles. Very good stuff.",Hanna
258,RhyanScorpioRhys,"""HANNA"" Seen it not sure how I feel about it",5,1 May 2011,"I can hate a film at twenty paces and not lose sleep about being the odd man out. I don't hate this film. Problem is, I don't like it, either.Saoirse Ronan does an excellent job pulling off wide-eyed wonder, vulnerability and is a convincing cold, dispassionate killer and I'll doff my cap to both Cate Blanchett (though that Southern accent started grating on my nerves) and Eric Bana for their performances. Tom Hollander? Not so much.The film itself could have been a unique actioner that explored life on the run through the eyes of a deadly-yet-naive young girl. What it actually is? A modern day fairy tale that lapses into techno-beat-driven-music-video-jump-cut action sequences, all built on the foundation of an old, worn out premise.""I just missed your heart."" Hanna states that twice in this film and that just about sums up my feeling about this flick.I just missed its heart.",Hanna
259,mikhail007,A misleading trailer and mishmash of different genres will leave most viewers disappointed,6,12 April 2011,"From the trailers Hanna looks like Bourne series with a young girl as a heroine. However, there is not much action in this movie and the action scenes that are present are not that great. The fighting is not choreographed well and camera angle is switched often during the sequences to hide this fact. This leaves you let down and nauseous. This movie is a more of a coming of age story with a target audience of adolescent girls. This makes Hanna a very bizarre combination of genres that will likely disappoint both action flick lovers and people who enjoy more watching drama movies.Overall I would rate this movie meh (with a shrug of shoulders). Maybe rent it when it comes out on DVD and forget about it.5.5/10",Hanna

262,JamesSaintRave,Best Reviewed Worst Film This Year-so far,3,15 April 2011,"Hanna is awful. Not in the usual Hollywierd, ""lets puke out an hour and a half of dung and make some money"" kind of way...but in the much more horrid category...""we think we made a smart, well written, well directed meaningful film..with a sterling cast..look how great our film is!"".......make no mistake---This is one of the best reviewed-Worst films I ever-almost-walked out of. The main problem is the story...we are suppose to have sympathy for the main character of ""Hanna""..we don't..almost from the very beginning..whats more she is god-awful annoying with her little Russian girl accent doing away with various ""really bad"" CIA agents--mostly American--draw your own politically incorrect conclusions about that heap of dung...Sadirse Ronan is all wrong for the role..she fails to get us on her side with her character the way she has done in past roles..most recently-with a stunning performance in the brilliant-lesser seen ""The Way Back"". But truth is-it is the asinine story that is the main culprit here..the flashy direction just adds to the agony..putting lipstick on a pig is about the only way to sum up this fart-fest as far as the direction--or lack of it--goes . One of the few films in my life I ever =almost-walked out of..the poorly reviewed ""Your Highness"" was playing in the theater right next to the restroom-for which I took many breaks- to see if I could just puke out my disenchantment with this turkey--I wish I would have just switched to ""Your Highness""....bad?maybe...but not as bad as this-and thats really BAAAD!! and at least it has Natalie Portman..an actress for which Sandirse will never..ever..be half as good as.",Hanna
263,TheDarkKnight21,A Techno Beat Odyssey Thriller,8,18 April 2011,"It makes me so happy to see films like this. A well-executed thriller with an awesome soundtrack and great performances leads to one of the pleasant surprises of the year.Hanna (Saorise Roman) is a sixteen-year-old girl living out in the Finnish wilderness with her father, Erik (Eric Bana). Her father aggressively trains Hanna to be a lethal and stealthy killer armed with a comprehensive intelligence capable of speaking multiple languages. Hanna yearns to go explore the outside world and be sent on a mission her father has been training her for her whole life: to assassinate Marissa Viegler (Cate Blanchett). Reluctantly, Erik allows Hanna to activate a CIA beacon that will bring Viegler to her warning his daughter that Viegler will not stop until either one is dead. And thus begins an intense cat-and-mouse chase across Europe as all parties involved rack up a body count.The film is expertly shot, and that's an important quality when you're making a espionage action thriller. Unlike that godawful Jason Bourne- shaky cam garbage, the film is shot in a way that shows you all the brutal kills, hard action, and great escapes. Even more impressive is when you see single shots that go for a good few minutes as the camera follows characters weaving in and out of the city streets and dockyards. Even more interesting is the use of soundtrack by techno band, The Chemical Brothers, which complements that fast and brutal fights with amazing beats. Director Joe Wright definitely knows how to film action sequences, but his biggest strength lies in getting great performances from his actor.Saorise Roman had a tough job to do: she had to play a physically-adept teenage assassin but one that lacked empathy or ability to understand basic human interactions. And wow she nails this performance and shows off major acting chops here. Despite playing as someone who didn't understand emotion, it was interesting to see her react to her first brushes with it be it involving friends, family, or even a lover. There are many scenes that can make you uneasy seeing a sixteen-year-old girl in that situation, but Roman as Hanna shows that not only she has no fear of the situation she can easily outwit and physically outlast any opponent that faces her. Eric Bana and Cate Blanchett both turn in fine supporting performances, and they do a great job playing the morally- conflicted characters they were.Hanna is the first quiet sleeper hit of the year. The great performances and amazing fight sequences are all complemented by one of the best techno soundtracks that puts Tron Legacy to shame. This is how you make a strong female character, one that can relate to both men and women, and make you root for them to survive an insane ordeal as she battles waves of opponents and cleverly escapes every time.",Hanna
264,tania_ap,deceived by the good reviews,4,15 June 2013,"If this movie has taught me anything, it is never to trust the good reviews... Although the film had a great cast, the plot was handled very poorly. Pity because it was an idea with potential. I got bored after the first 20 minutes...It is one of the movies that, the next day you cannot remember anything about the characters or the end because it is that forgettable. I understand that not every film can be amazing and that many films exist just to entertain. But when you a see a movie like this getting a score of 7/10, leaving behind many great movies then you can not help but wonder why. The actors were pretty decent but they were given nothing to deliver.",Hanna
265,Asmith580,A gasp of fresh air in an otherwise dominated genre!,8,8 September 2011,"This movie may be ahead of its time. You may not get how everything plays out until the second go around, but I assure you, it is worth watching more than once. Hanna mixes the enjoyment of an action thriller with the emotion of a drama. It seems like only open minded individuals like this movie and people really frowned on some of the small details, but this is most likely because of there personal prejudices. We should all be very appreciative of the stellar acting in this movie. Not only did the main actors portray their characters wonderfully, but so did the actors in the minor roles. This film was shot very well and was a delight to see. I, unfortunately, missed watching it in the theaters, but I wish I would have. Hanna takes you through a lot in its short run-time and the pace may have been too quick for some to fully grasp the story line in full detail, but this is my only complaint. Hanna is not a typical mindless action thriller and the plot is not spelled out for you in black and white. It requires you to be engrossed enough to put the pieces together on your own. It isn't about a macho ""Rambo"" type of guy mindlessly killing everyone he sees, so please don't expect that. It is a story of a young woman trying to find her place in a world that has tried to destroy her. A lot of the people saying that there are holes in this movie's plot are sadly mistaken. All of the answers to the their questions are in the movie, all they had to do was pay attention. Movies of this type don't typically do well in reviews and the fact that it maintains a 7.5 or so, should show you that it is worth the watch. Have fun and enjoy.",Hanna
266,movieexplosion,Solid addition to the Assassin genre,6,18 May 2011,"Wow, what a great performance from Saoirse Ronan. She is developing well as an actress and I look forward to her future work. In this movie she plays Hanna, a young girl raised by her father Erik(Eric Bana) to be an efficient and deadly assassin. Her upbringing in a remote arctic area has left her lacking in the area of social skills and experiences and as she embarks on her first mission she is amazed and overwhelmed by our fascinating world. Whilst on this mission she is hunted by the ruthless and obsessive agent Marissa(Cate Blanchett).Hanna reminds me of Jean Reno as 'Leon', not only because of her deadly assassin skills but also with her childlike view of the world and fans of that movie should definitely check this one out. There may be comparisons to 'Kickass''s Hitgirl but this is the more realistic version of that. Blanchett is scarily good as a villain and Bana gives good backup to what is Ronan's movie. Great violence, interesting drama and some thrilling scenes make this a solid addition to the assassin genre.",Hanna
267,dumbass-738-639380,Not what I expected,5,15 June 2011,"Seeing how very much this movie is advertised, I was really surprised when I saw it. When I went to see this movie, I expected something of a mission impossible type of deal, you know, where the plot is very serious and every detail is taken care of (to appease a wider audience). And yet the movie turned out to be something completely different. It was more of a humorous, awkward, Die Hard kind of, only with a little girl (Saoirse Ronan) instead of Bruce. The plot was very illogical, full of dark humour, really weird settings and lots of loose ends (in my opinion).Now, I can't say that I was disappointed, because, the music was really good and the acting was interesting, but I think there could be many improvements made to this movie.Overall, it's a solid 7/7 and I would say it is very similar in style to In Bruges and Leon, so I you enjoyed those movies, you will definitely enjoy Hanna, but I don't think it's the right movie for the Pirates of the Caribbean fans.",Hanna
268,m143386,Exciting and stylish enough to overcome its flaws,7,7 September 2011,"This is an interesting one. It seems to provoke very strong reactions. People either seem to love it or detest it. I suppose if i was an artist or filmmaker that would be something i would seek.I certainly didn't love it but i did like it a lot. I can understand many of the criticisms that others have made about it but i still found it an enjoyable experience because the story is compelling and i did want to see what happened. The design and style and atmosphere created are perfect for the story being told and the main performances were compelling and convincing. There is little point talking about the plot because it is easy to spoil the movie for others, suffice it to say that it is a melding of many other films, like Leon, the Bourne Identity, Run Lola Run but it is also heavily influenced, in story, characterisation and design by European fairy tales both overtly with the scenes in the abandoned Brothers Grimm theme park but also implicitly, with Cate Blanchet channelling the Ice Queen for her performance.Also on the plus side is the feel of the movie. It feels like a European movie, rather than a movie simply set in Europe (see Taken) and the pumping Techno soundtrack by the Chemical Brothers drives the action on and adds to the 'chase' feel of the plot. I would also cite the main performances as a reason this movie works. Firstly there is Saorise Ronan who is perfect as the blank slate, intellectually but not emotionally prepared for the world. Hers has been a simple life, where all efforts have been made to prepare her for the task ahead but she is able to communicate her surprise and pleasure at seeing and experiencing what she had only read about in an encyclopedia. Eric Bana is also great as the father figure who is single-mindedly preparing Hanna for the confrontation ahead but while his performance is contained, he is able to communicate the strength of feeling that he has for his daughter and protégé. And Cate as mentioned is very comfortable as the Ice Queen, icy and deadly but also has the subtlety to get across her emotional connection to the case. What drives those emotions is not always clear but they are obvious beneath the icy exterior. I also loved the creepy and sinister Tom Hollander which came completely out of left-field.I'd like to address some of the main criticisms made in other reviews. The plot does have holes you could drive a double-decker bus through, but where in a lesser movie this would drive me to distraction, i was so caught up in this that it didn't have that effect. The English family were annoying. So? They were meant to be annoying. They are based on the directors own family and they are typical of middle class pseudo hippy, modern parents...Guess what, those people are annoying. The accents are awful but Europe is such a melting pot that people do have such mongrel accents and some of the characters are agents, practiced in deceit and might be expected to slip from time to time...Get over it. Some threads are left unexplained, like the fate of the English family...Well considering most people found them annoying, i can't see why people are so exercised but what we have is a Director that trusted his audience enough so that he didn't have to explain every little detail and allowed us to decide their fate for ourselves...but for those with little imagination, then simply look at what happens to the others who the 'bad guys' encounter during the chase or take solace in the fact that they were not tortured and could be released after being spun a line about the CIA tracking down a murderer to save the life of Hanna.While by no means a perfect film this has enough pace, style, skill and atmosphere to make it a very enjoyable watch.",Hanna
269,will-193-915459,Good but not great,7,1 January 2012,"This could have so easily been a great movie had they done just two things... doubled the pace and increased the action.But, with that aside let's focus on the positives for the film...Soundtrack - fantastic. Really funky beats (Chemical Brothers for the most) and you really feel the playful and intense mood the film is trying to achieve.Plot - solid and quirky, full of humour and intrigue.Action - brilliant... fight scenes you can actually follow! Well choreographed and you feel every punch, kick and stab!Performances - excellent, all the cast are believable and enjoyable, even when they are misbehaving...Will's verdict - Rent/Borrow it, well worth one watch*a note - a modern-day Leon it is not... there is one common theme but the similarities end there, the film is its own thing, very unique, very watchable.",Hanna

It has such a refreshing original story. It feels like a really really good anime (The Japanese are kings when it comes to original story lines in my opinion). The characters of this film are all extremely memorable. The mood, the setting... Just unbelievable. One of the greatest things about the film is the film's visual grammar and cinematography. And it has a strong marriage of sound and picture. Everything just felt so right. There are some plot holes, but they're not even worth mentioning when a film is this good.

She has an amazing German accent what I liked the most , and how her ""father"" developed her skills. In my opinion I can't identify oneself with the Father. I didn't feel emphatic , I didn't feel the energy. He looks great, He fights well. The 3rd most important person in this story is Cate Blanchett as Marissa. WoW. Just WoW . She is an amazing actress.

273,uchio,A spy thriller with an interesting twist,9,12 October 2016,"This is an excellent tightly paced spy thriller with an interesting plot twist. Saoirse Ronan gives an wonderful performance as the titular Hanna. Her portrayal is vulnerable, sympathetic, and also bad-ass. Eric Bana and Cate Blanchett also give decent performances, although they are nothing memorable. The soundtrack by the Chemical Brothers adds much to the film. It provides an almost surreal atmosphere to the movie. Some would say that there are glaring plot holes in Hanna. However, there are not in my opinion, worse than any other action movie - certainly no worse than mainstream Hollywood films. This film is a bit quirky, but that is what makes it charming. Hanna is definitely a film worth watching.*FYI: I gave the film 9/10 here, but that is just to bring the score up. It's closer to 8/10 IMO.",Hanna

275,TalkingContradiction,Another by the numbers action flick that attempts to be more but fails to succeed,6,8 May 2011,"There's more than enough proved talent here to make an exceptional film but it goes largely to waste in this by the numbers spook action thriller. The premise: A child raised in isolation trained to be a peerless in armed and unarmed combat but is woefully socially inexperienced, who is made to confront evil and humanity at large while not wholly original is interesting enough but the execution is ultimately banal and clumsy. Outside of the titular main character Hanna played by Saoirse Ronanall the characters are one-note plot devices and nothing more, their actions often failing to really mesh with their supposed goals and motivations. For example: in 13 years of preparing Hanna for her fight against Cate Blanchett's character Eric Bana's character failed to show her single picture of her target, despite clearly having contacts in the outside world with the means to provide one. And Cate Blanchett's character despite killing every other person involved in the clandestine operation she's trying to cover up seems to wish to capture Hanna alive, which simply makes no sense within the context of the film. The action scenes while generally competent are not memorable and a few instances were edited with such obvious stunt-cuts it completely took me out of the movie. The editing in general seemed sub-par; Cate Blanchett's accent is highly inconsistent and she's played an American character in many films without so much as a hitch. The film is at its strongest when Hanna finds herself exploring the wider world she was cut off from her entire life but this aspect of the film and the character is only ever explored a few times and not very deeply at that, certainly not enough to the point where it overshadows the films shortcomings. Its a pity, Hanna is an entertaining movie at times but the weak plot, shallow characters, and technical flubs really detract from the overall experience.",Hanna
276,sjanzeir,What could have been a perfect film is ruined by that opening.,9,2 November 2020,"There isn't much that could be improved in Hanna, except for that sloppy, poorly thought out opening.The very first shot, with some icy features, immediately pans to the right. It wouldn't have hurt to keep the shot steady for three seconds or so.Then there was the reveal of a girl named Hanna that came too soon. It would've been far better to linger with the deer (or was it an elk?) for a few seconds longer, and then drop a scare with an arrow that came out of nowhere.And then comes the sin of all sins: the tussle with her father Eric. It would have been a great twist if Erik Heller stayed silent for as long as the tussle played out, and then tell the girl that she's the one who's going to drag the carcass home.",Hanna
277,andwhite1,What a steaming pile of sheep dung...,1,4 March 2012,"Jesus. I know no one will see this but I still needed to review the movie. I made an account just to voice my displeasure. To add insult to injury I am now adding on to the 2 hours I already lost from my life. I am simply trying to keep others from making the same mistake.HOW!? did this movie get such good reviews? I am middle age. I have seen a LOT of movies in my life. I can almost always find something to appreciate for all the hard work that went into making it. Eric Bana. Good. I see he should have played the Liam Neeson part in the new Batmans. Would have been much better. His copy in this movie was an improvement.Hanna. Wondered around all wide eyed and innocent just like in the Lovely Bones. She has that down cold.Kate Blanchett. Terrible. Did she even read the script before committing to this?OK. The story. Plot. Pile of vomit. Whatever you want to call it. I am just going to get it all out there so bear with me. Bourne copy (among others). Instead of brainwashed super spy assassin. You get genetically modified in the uterus 13 year old super spy assassin. Hanna.CIA program? Shut down by Kate. Probably rightly so. Assets exterminated. Presumably mothers and kids. Eric feels guilty? Maybe - it is never explained. Eric makes a last ditch attempt to save one mother and one child. Kate kills mother. Eric gets away with Hanna. Instead of honoring his original intentions (I guess b/c he is so mad at Kate for trying to kill him) he negates the one honorable thing he has tried to do in life by saving the mother and child and instead raises her as the assassin she was intended to be. All in order to kill Kate for his own revenge (and possibly for Hannah to have revenge for Kate killing her mother)? It is never made clear. Got all that. Why didn't they just go live in suburbia and live a normal life? No one knows. Why didn't' Eric just kill Kate himself? Again. No one knows.He raises her in the arctic circle in a small cabin with an encyclopedia and Grimm's fairy tales. No modern conveniences. Doesn't teach her about them. Activates an ""agent transponder"" that apparently has a battery that can last 14+ years. Eric runs away (in a suit in the arctic circle) and leaves Hanna hoping Kate will make an appearance and Hannah can kill her. Great plan huh? Then Hannah uses her training and kills who she thinks is Kate(and a lot of other people) and gets away. How this got a pg-13 I don't know. Everyone dies except Hanna.Then an interlude where Hanna gets to be a teenager and make friends with a nice normal family. When the bad guys catch up she leaves her adopted family to die at the hands of two laughable German skinhead caricatures and a weird Euro-trash guy. She gets away. Forget the fact that the nice normal family could have driven away at any time while Hannah was fighting the weirdos (and not killing. Even though earlier she killed numerous fully armed and trained US special forces soldiers). It is just so ludicrous.Meanwhile Eric somehow SWIMS from the Arctic circle to Germany. Amazing. Kills some people. And they all end up meeting in Germany. Every character has died up to now. Interject some more pointless fairy tale symbolism. Then skinheads die, Then eurotrash guy dies. Eric dies then Kate dies. The end.Oh I forgot. With a sledgehammer the writer and direct try to tie it all back together to a deer hunt in the first scene of the movie (in case we forgot). Oh. The arrow. The heart. Oh the symbolism. SOOO deep. Baarrfff. Give me a break. Even insinuating that Kate didn't HAVE a heart would have made more symbolic sense than ""oops, just missed it. Just like the deer two hours ago. My bad"".After sitting there watching the credits I realized that Hanna was indeed a sociopath serial killer who did need to die. And Eric and Kate needed to die for creating her. But Kate wasn't really evil. She was just a high level CIA person (with bad gums) doing her thankless jobs as best she is able...I only scratched the surface of the ridiculous holes in this plot. Spy assassin fairy tale. What Sh*t. I can suspend disbelief. I get that! But do so in the amount required by this movie would mean I no longer exist. I will never understand the good ratings for this crap. If substituting a waif like 13 yo girl for Jason Bourne is what we call good these days...I really am getting old.GET OFF MY LAWN!",Hanna
278,briggsgarland,"Strong cast, nice photography but ultimately brainless",4,29 June 2011,"Aside from a strong performance from Saoirse Ronan and some gorgeous images, Hanna requires about as much intelligence as any Michael Bay explosion fest. The plot is painfully predictable and the lengths the filmmakers go to insure the audience knows the good guys from the bad guys is almost comical. Cate Blanchette and her gang of sexually depraved, Neo-Nazi skinheads might as well be wearing t-shirts that say ""Evil"". The underlying issue of Hanna's mysterious origins is entirely unfulfilling and could probably be written off as little more than a Maguffin. Somewhat enjoyable if you're willing to check your brain at the door for 111 minutes but there are much better action films out there so I'd probably recommend skipping it.",Hanna
279,PaulX7,the stupidest movie of the year,3,28 June 2011,"I can't decide which one is stupidest, between Hanna and Source Code. After many thoughts I think Hanna is. The topic was interesting (a young girl was raised by an ex-CIA agent in the mountains to become an assassin and fulfil a mission), but the stupid scenario, poor dialogue (the ""I just missed your heart"" amongst others), the clichés, the way how it was directed and most of the music and soundtrack were ABSOLUTE rubbish. Below are some examples (and believe me there are lots!) of the ridiculous, laughable and stupid moments in the film: - She was imprisoned in a CIA cell located in the desert of Morocco which incredibly looks like the southwest of the USA - After shooting a few CIA agents, her face was covered with blood. The whole scene when she escaped from that CIA location gave me a headache because of the way it was filmed and the techno music (the post production probably wanted to re-create a cool-stylish-ish effect a la Matrix but they pathetically failed) - Hanna has no money yet was able to send a postcard to her father somewhere in Europe (how did she know how to buy a postcard and walk to the post office? She spent her life in the mountains, remember? Besides she had 0 money...) - Hanna was raised all her life in the mountains. She had never seen a TV or had electricity, yet she was able to walk into an internet café and surf the web to look for information about DNA I could go on for hours, but I'll stop here. The movie is rubbish, the scenario is rubbish, the dialogues are rubbish and the music is rubbish. I don't understand what worldwide famous actors such as Eric Bana and Cate Blanchet are doing in this failure",Hanna
280,halbarad_loire,It's hard to say,6,19 May 2011,"Acting. Brilliant (for the most part). Direction. Bad. Story. It's hard to say.It's really hard to put this film forward. While the story has some rather large plot holes/inconsistencies I didn't come in expecting something brilliant. It was advertised wrong, I will say that for certain.It isn't the thinking man's film because if you think about it, as I did, it can sadly lower your opinion of it, if ever so slightly.But anyway. The acting is great by the kids especially and I always like Eric Bana. Blanchett gave one of her weaker performances in this film but almost all the acting was marred by the directing and the inconsistency of it. Accents change from scene to scene. Fighting seems cut apart and one minute a guy is thrown to the floor in a move that is sure to break his arm only to be stood up two seconds later.bleh, it's hard to say. For every bad part there is a good part and then a few good parts thrown in for good measure.

I managed to sit through it but if I had a 12 year old with me I would have demanded a refund as it is totally unsuitable for children of that age. The girl who played the part of Hanna was good but it is a shame that she got involved in this drivel. Same of Eric Bana and Kate Blanchett. It is pointless garbage interspersed with a lot of violence and a some of it is nasty stuff. Pointless, weird sexual innuendo throughout. I won't waste time mentioning the plot as it's non existent.

285,wcoleparks,Immerse yourselves in Wright's unique and captivating world,9,21 June 2016,"Every once in a while a film comes along that completely immerses you into a new and intriguing world unlike any other. Such is the case with Hanna. Joe Wright takes a number of well-worn action tropes and reinvents them into a sort of twisted, kinetic fairytale. As the film begins, we see Hanna (Saoirse Ronan), merely a teenager; killing a deer with precision and sureness that immediately makes us aware of the skillset we are sure to see more of. We soon find out that she lives in the remote wilderness with no contact to the outside world with her father, Erik Heller (Eric Bana). Hanna has known no one else apart from him but is comforted by her imagination. Music for example, a term she can recite the definition to at any time, distracts her thoughts as she wonders what it might actually sound like. However, as Hanna becomes increasingly curious about the outside world, her father realizes it is time to tell her the truth. He tells her of Marissa Wiegler (Cate Blanchett), the fact that she wants them dead, and that the second they leave from hiding, they will be hunted until they or Marissa Wiegler are dead. This is about all the backstory we are treated to and only bits and pieces get filled in as the story progresses. But just like any fairytale, it doesn't matter how or why there is a house made of candy out in the woods. It is fascinating nonetheless. The incredible cast of characters in this film is almost too many to mention. Of course we have Saoirse Ronan as Hanna, who proved how talented she was well before this film in Atonement. Here she continues to mature and plays the innocent yet deadly character with ease. Eric Bana as her father is slightly underused but shines when he needs to. Especially in one long take where things become increasingly uneasy. Cate Blanchett plays a wicked stepmother type character with an intensity that clearly shows how much fun she is having in the role. She plays the role with a faux accent, which seems to come and go, but that hardly matters when her screen presence is so alluring. The other supporting characters also seem to take their roles and run with them. As much as they may be overacting in any other film, it almost seems appropriate in this fantasy-like world Hanna has found herself in. Cate Blanchett's minions especially immerse themselves in this twisted fairytale. The main henchman always has a tune to whistle. And what could be an annoying affectation becomes a great way to create palpable tension. A family Hanna ends up tagging along with for a large part of the film is also filled with quirky people. Although they could come across as an irresponsible ""hippie"" type family that becomes a disservice to the film, the characters are treated in such a way that they become just the opposite. Wright, along with the script, does a great job of showing them from an innocent and unassuming perspective just as Hanna views them. Though they made be weird, so is she, so who cares.Joe Wright, coming off two beautiful period pieces with Pride and Prejudice and Atonement, as well as the forgettable The Soloist, makes a seriously impressive change here. Though he keeps many characteristics of his early work, he molds them in such a way that they perfectly fit this new genre he is working under. Most impressive are the action scenes. Wright never settles on one way to increase the intensity of a scene. He manages to keep changing his tactics as the film progresses to emphasize a scene's atmosphere. Two scenes in particular are filled with quick cuts and unique camera angles that portray the confusion and disorientation of each very well. It makes us feel as though the characters are trapped in a huge maze with only one way out. Another scene, which I mentioned earlier, is filmed with one long take. Starting above ground and going down into a subway station, the scene impressively builds suspension and doubt as people move awkwardly behind our character to avoid being spotted. Apart from the impressive actions scenes, there are many quieter scenes in which Wright allows the characters to hold the attention of the audience. And with Hanna's many encounters with eclectic individuals, this is not a difficult task. However, some of these scenes feel a little awkward compared to the rest of the story. One scene in particular finds a flirty teenage boy who gets a little too close to Hanna and ends up on her bad side. What is played for comedic effect falls very flat. Another shows Hanna finally hearing the music she had dreamed about her whole life. What should be a touching moment where Hanna finds some comfort in the real world feels out of place and very insincere. Apart from these few scenes though, Wright's emphasis on characters creates a real bond to every person on screen, which makes it all the more impactful when characters die on screen or off. And keeping with Hanna's twisted fairytale world, every character is in danger of dying. Just like in the classic Brothers Grimm stories, characters, both good and bad, are never free from harm. Although all these impressive action scenes and many of the quieter moments work so well on their own, the Chemical Brother's soundtrack really puts them over the top. It immediately heightens the intensity of the action while also maintaining the gravity of the situation when things on screen start to die down. So what could be just another generic action film filled with plot holes becomes something else entirely. Despite having those exact problems, Joe Wright turns them into a wholly unique and fascinating world for the audience to get lost in. I was enraptured in this eccentric, oddly crafted fairytale.",Hanna
286,TheVern,"""Hanna"" is a new version of ""Snow White and the seven dwarfs""",8,8 April 2011,"The new movie from Joe Wright(""Attonement"") can easily be compared to Fairy tales, and more precisely ""Snow White and the seven dwarfs"". Hanna(Saorise Ronan) is Snow White, Marissa(Cate Blanchett) is the wicked queen, Erik; Hanna's father(Eric Bana) is the kind woodsman who hides his daughter in the forest, and there is a family that befriends Hanna while she is on the run and they become like the seven dwarfs.Many viewers may compare Hanna to Hit-Girl from ""Kick Ass"" because they both have the same idea of a young girl training to be an assassin by their father. Hanna is different because she doesn't enjoy killing, she just does it to survive. Hit-Girl becomes just a bit too happy when she gets to kill people. ""Hanna"" is more of a character drama than an action movie but it's the drama of this young girl that makes the action scenes more memorable.To read more of this review and others.Check out www.videovangaurd.com",Hanna

290,mgatton,Plot less but you don't know it til the end.,5,20 October 2011,This is one of those movies where the just had an idea then tried to make the movie around the idea but didn't bother to work out a plot first. The whole premise of the movie being a spy chase thriller could have been obviated in the first ten minutes. Why send out a homing signal to the people who want to kill you? Why not hunt them down and kill them yourself in quiet assassin-like secrecy? If you have been underground for 12 years why blow your cover just for the sake of proving how great your training has been? Great music. Cool visuals. Fairly decent fight scenes. It was a half good movie. You won't realize it wasn't all good until the last few minutes when they wrap it up in a clichéd ending that mirrors the beginning complete with matching dialog and imagery.,Hanna

And of course he didn't teach her anything about modes of transport, or money, or hotels or anything really except how to kill.

292,johndil,Pretentious garbage.,3,11 September 2012,"I cannot believe the fawning reviews for this movie on here, it is poorly acted pretentious garbage. The story as you must know by now is of a girl raised in the wilds of Finland by her ex CIA father who teaches her how to fight, shoot, speak different languages etc, a teen assassin,you get the picture. All well and good, but apart from Saoirse Ronan the acting is very poor Blanchett is extremely bad, very camp and unbelievable, Bana is poor too, he's very unconvincing, at times looking like he does not want to be there, both badly cast, the hippy trippy English couple and their kids that pop up mid movie are also poorly acted, annoying and really just unnecessary fluff. Saoirse Ronan does a decent acting job, but in the fight scenes (thankfully there aren't many) she's just not convincing at all, the ""blows"" she delivers look far too weak to induce the impact shown on screen, indeed you can see with some of the blows her arms just bounce off the perpetrators, decent idea badly executed. The only way is to judge for yourself, but I would not recommend it!",Hanna
293,dvigilante1,It's really bad,4,2 October 2011,"Spoiler: I usually don't write reviews but I had to for this one since the critic's were raving about it. My initial thought when first viewing the trailer was negative. Mainly because it's difficult to believe a 60lb girl can kill trained assassins 3 times her size. I didn't see this in the theater I was going to wait till DVD. As it got closer to release I kept seeing this film pop up in conversations and blogs about how good it is.I'm here to say that my initial impression was spot on. Not only was the story bad but so was some of the technical camera stuff and fight scenes. I'm far from a movie snob that looks for technical issues while viewing a film but some of the things in this movie were so obvious the average viewer can't help but scratch their head at why the director left it as is. A lot of it had to do with editing. One example towards the end Eric Bana's character is running from a skinhead and he has to be at least several yards away. It's your typical chase scene. Then cut to Bana is behind a van waiting to attack the bad guy. It didn't make sense because one minute they're on the street the next they're in an abandoned playground that just happens to have a broken down van. There are quite a few other scenes like that throughout the movie eg fast cuts to random scenes.The fight scenes should've been better. I was hoping for kick-ass / hitgirl type action. Instead it felt like Bourne Identity. The problem it's hard for the average viewer to suspend their imagination into believing a 13yr girl had go toe to toe / exchange body blows with adult men (who also wear armor). Also, the whole Eric Bana sensei thing doesn't work. If he can train Hanna he should be able to train other people too. Which I'm sure he did when he worked for the gov't. Yet those same trained people can't beat a young girl. Also Hanna goes from killing dozens of people via hand2hand then towards the end she struggles killing three people.I could go on but I won't waste your time like this movie did mine. If you do decide to rent it, other things that were odd are: weird techno/pop music, Hanna's posture when walking, Hanna is emotionless yet at the end she's an emotional wreck, 13yr old lesbo kiss scene, Kate Blanchett as an army of one that kills everyone, Hanna's obvious stunt double, and the constant running in several directions but going nowhere.Oh one more thing. Eric Bana taught Hanna how to hunt but he didn't teach her how to survive in the modern world. The majority of assassins in movies nowadays know how to travel the world via fake passports, a cellphone, fake disguises and thievery. For some reason Hanna seems like she was sent from the 1800's. Scared of lights and TV etc and yet in the next scene she is a master of a PC at an internet cafe.",Hanna
294,Pedskii,Léon 2.0. Refreshing movie!,8,28 October 2017,A young girl grows up to be a fast lethal killer. A bit suggestive picture for a common action movie but I really liked the effort to make it a bit more at the art direction then the blow-everything-up direction. I liked the characters and the story. If you are a hardcore Marvel and DC fan maybe this movie seems a bit boring. But if you liked Léon and Jason Bourne maybe you will like Hanna. A refreshing action movie if you feel like every other Hollywood movie just constantly blow everything up.,Hanna
295,wdytreviews,What big teeth you have,7,24 October 2011,"Hanna is a movie that makes you wonder, how hard is it to raise a teenage daughter? Living in a Grimm forest near the Arctic circle, raising a daughter not being influenced by Disney or MTV should be a piece of cake. So maybe you feel like you are cheating so you train her to be a perfect assassin from a toddler. Natural choice considering as a father you are a rogue CIA agent. This is the setup for a fast paced Euro chase movie that does a very good job of making the possibility of a teenage girl being Jason Bourne (instead of amnesia just unaware of the circumstances of her birth) is very real.Saoirse Ronan does an exceptional job of performing both the action and the emotional punch needed to make the movie work. Joe Wright also directs this interesting nuevo fairytale in great fashion. The only over the top character in the movie is Cate Blanchett (uncomfortable Texan drawl), the villainous unfeeling CIA superior who is looking to cover the tracks and the story of Erik (Eric Bana) and his daughter Hanna.Hanna is essentially the coming of age story of a sheltered little girl who believes in her father wholly. She then runs away from home to avenge her mother's death only to find out that she doesn't really know anything except that it is a long way to grandma's house.",Hanna

297,phyllisknox,"Fast, moving and original",8,3 July 2013,"If you love magical realism, folk and fairy tales and absolutely beautiful cinematography, this one is for you. ""Hanna"" has the beauty and luminosity of Babette's Feast crossed with the grit of a very tight action film. Beautifully written, with a wonderful tension between the believable and fantastic, it reminded me a little of the novels of South American magic realism. It is smart, sweet, acrid and transcendent in turns and all though out. It is set in the Arctic, Morocco and the US and Germany, giving us a taste of the wild and exotic played against the bustle, flash and sophistication of diverse cities. The scenes that set us up to care for Hanna and her father at the beginning of the film, cast a mystical glamour over the whole viewing experience, and acts as a foil for the rest movie. The acting of main players Soierse Ronan, Eric Bana and Cate Blanchett carry the film to the very end, Cate is frightening and blood-chilling in this one. There is seamless character acting by all supporting cast. The conundrum of just who and what Hanna is and who she will become keeps things taut and true to the very end.",Hanna
298,sudsmania,A Total Mess,6,11 October 2013,"It's so unfortunate to see such a promising story line end wasted. It's very hard to grab the exact theme of the movie even after watching the first-half. There were so many meager details that were not explained. Making a movie doesn't just mean focusing on the big plot, but also fortifying it by explaining all the peripheral details.It was such a lovely story, but the movie couldn't cover the whole picture. The end was the most horrible part of the movie. If the movie was to end in this way, then why waste time building the character. As I watched on the movie, the character's purpose seemed so strong and I was waiting for a big bang at the end, but nothing happened. This movie is a disappointment because for me this movie never ended.",Hanna
299,b1038752,One of my favourite movies,10,11 October 2015,"Currently doing the loop again on UK terrestrial TV so I thought I'd give it another spin.Saoirse Ronan's performance as Hanna is one of those that makes you seek out their other work, consume it hungrily and watch out for what they are doing next. Excellent.As it turned out I had already seen a lot of what she has done before (and enjoyed it) but her look and delivery in this one was so different that I failed to recognise her (I'll partially blame the white blonde eyebrow tint in this one). Very refreshing for me to see an actor so immersed in a role that they become unrecognisable and not an actor playing themselves (again (& again)) in various set piece roles.Of course there are holes (Eric Bana crosses arctic in 2 pce suit) but none that I think have detracted from a great story. I could have found the camp Germanic villainry annoying but found them amusing instead.Great supporting roles too, particularly among the younger cast of her travelling companions.Favourite quote not on the quotes page: Travelling companion Sophie: ""I think I'd quite like to be a lesbian but not one of those fat ones. One who's like a supermodel but we'd only hold hands and I'd probably marry a man"" Hanna: ""What?"" Forget the genre comparisons and just enjoy the movie.You will believe that a skinny 17 year old could break your neck like a twig but hey, I knew that already.",Hanna
300,iceblast-2,This movie ticked me off! They really dropped the ball with this one.,3,2 June 2012,"They make a big deal out of this young girl being trained all her life to be like a super soldier, it's a really interesting idea. Then they screw it all the hell.Her father teaches her to be good with a gun. But only uses one in the beginning of the movie. That's it.I guess her father never learned how to change his appearance, to sneak or use cover when running away from someone with a gun. So, he never taught Hanna. Hanna is suppose to be a killing machine. But she can't take out 3 guys that are chasing her, and Marrisa is better trained then her somehow. She is able to sneak up on her father and Hanna with no problem. At the very end, it's just plain dumb luck that Marrisa didn't just shoot her in the head.This movie had so much going for it. But it's so weak, they screwed up so many things. Most of the movie could have been done by a untrained girl. It started good, and just fell all the part.People wonder why Action movies are dying, it's because they are making crappy Action movies. The star is suppose to kick everyone's ass. Not the other way around.The father wanted Marrisa dead. 10 years later, he could have just walked up behind her and shot her dead. He was a dead man anyway. Who would know it was him.This is just a pointless movie.What happen to the family she was riding with. Probably dead, but you never find out.Before I started watching this movie, I read reviews. I saw a lot of people hating on this movie. I see this a lot, and thought they were just another bunch of idiots who don't like movies that make you think, or have a deeper meaning or something like that. Never thought I would agree with them. I would say, don't waste your time, unless your really bored.The girl from Kickass should have done this movie. Not the actress, just the character from Kickass. She would have kicked ass here. Hanna wouldn't stand a chance.",Hanna
301,YuunofYork,"Forced, simplistic plot drowns out notable performances",5,12 December 2016,"I really wanted to like Hanna. Sure, the premise is ridiculous, but there was something appealing about a globetrotting female teenage assassin. I thought the fairy tale elements I had heard about sounded original and borderline literary. I thought Eric Bana's agent had finally chosen a decent script.Of course such indulgent expectations were never met. Hanna (Saoirse Ronan) is a young girl living in Finland. All she knows of life comes from her father, with whom she lives off the land hunting and trapping, an outdated single-volume encyclopedia which is the sum of her formal education, and her own instincts. It turns out the pair are hiding from a shady CIA sub-director named Marissa Wiegler (Blanchett) because reasons. The father (Bana) has been grooming Hanna to assassinate this director. It is unclear why. We later learn Hanna has a motive for revenge - but she doesn't learn this until well after she is given the chance to kill Marissa. It could mean they no longer have to hide in an arctic wilderness, but surely data disks and carbon-copied memos and all those willing subordinates? Like actual fairy tales, the why doesn't seem to matter very much.It would seem, then, it's been left up to the action to carry the film, but where is it? Hanna is given a way to announce herself to a roomful of operatives just waiting for a 15-year-old transmitter to activate, and is brought into headquarters to face Wiegler. Of course, things aren't what they seem, and Hanna must escape the facility. It's an interesting sequence, all two and a half minutes of it. Indeed, the biggest problem in Hanna seems to be pacing, with a lot of eye-candy up front, a drawn out meandering second act that does nothing but maneuver these characters around Europe, and a fizzled finale. There are further shoot-outs, chases, and assassinations, and while I can admire their realism (the choreography and short duration of the fights, not how they relate to the plot), they take up such little time we're back to globetrotting, or exposition, or unusually late and gratuitous opportunities for Marissa Wiegler to kick puppies. Rarely did a scene feel necessary instead of merely discontinuous. Now here is a scene I suppose we're doing so the baddies can find out that she found out that they found out that she's in this city now, and so on. There is an extended sequence in north Africa where Hanna interacts for the first time with a normal human family (somebody's idea of normal, at any rate), and then tags along in their caravan with upbeat song and dance. The whole thing is odd. Our little assassin may have forgotten all about the first act, but the audience sure hasn't. Interlude or plot point? You decide, someone's got to. Peculiar is the word here. I can't fault its originality, but this is a film where almost nobody's actions make any sense - not Hanna's, not her father's, and especially not Wiegler's. The grand reveal (essentially who and what Hanna is) is figured out by the audience in the first scene of dialogue, but requires two hours of film to reveal it to Hanna - and there are no consequences when it is. The villains are (intentionally) caricatured reconstructions from fairy tales - the evil spinster, the big bad wolf - but the hero doesn't fit the mold. Hanna is emotionless and sociopathic (with good reason, we find out), and therefore doesn't work as a relatable vessel. As for the father, his decisions are among the stupidest ever performed by a fictional protagonist since Police Academy.And it's a shame, because there is some strong acting here. Ronan, Bana, and Blanchett's characters are inestimably likable (or unlikable, as needed). Blanchett's southern accent breaks in places, but it is a small detail - she's got the timbre of a villain down pat and that's what matters. The film watches like demo footage for Ronan, who doesn't get the chance to emote very often, but is put through a lot of physical activity, deliver lines in five languages, even work with the worst lighting department in the industry (were 70% of this film's outdoor shots done at 6 pm?).It seems impossible not to compare Hanna to the Bourne movies. The similarities are many: both plots are utterly ridiculous barely serviceable in moving the story forward, both characters are similar having almost the exact same origin story, both are ostensibly action films. Except with Bourne the studios felt comfortable resting the dialogue and viewpoint squarely on Matt Damon's shoulders, where for some reason Ronan gave them cold feet. Instead Hanna is filled to the brim with a long line of friendly adults (cannon fodder, all) who show up to siphon the story momentarily before shoving off again. That Hanna is written to be a loner does not gel well with the attempts to give her people to care about, either. 5/10, because it is a film with very interesting goals, just falling disappointingly short",Hanna

306,laddiebuck,A beauty; went over the head of the action-film pack,10,31 July 2011,"So first of all, this movie is a feast for the heart, eyes, and ears. There is so much wit and beauty in the cinematography and the directing that it lifts it to a work of art... But that's not why we go see a movie, we see it because it has to appeal to us on an emotional level and Hanna certainly does. Saoirse Ronan puts in a tour-de-force emotional performance, and it goes without saying that she also does all the action scenes very well. She absolutely steals the show, but she is supported by great acting from the rest of the cast, especially the father, the English girl, and the old magician.You'll see a lot of negative reviews. Basically if you are blunted to beauty or subtlety, as a lot of the reviewers seem to be, you won't like it. This ain't no Mission: Impossible. Double-crossings and explosions aren't going to be keeping you on the edge of your seat. The thriller part of the plot is probably the weakest part of the actual film. To be fair, if you bother to pick up on subtle cues, the plot doesn't have too many holes, a quality which a lot of the intellectually lazy reviewers here obviously didn't have.No, the plot is fairly straightforward, and in fact at heart it's not an action or a thriller plot. This film is mostly Hanna's emotional (and physical) journey, not exactly a coming-of-age story, but which is, anyway, a much better setting for the inspired cinematography, beautiful location work, powerful and exciting action scenes (compellingly, thrillingly scored), fairy-tale allegory, direction that rises to an art form, and even some humour (both verbal and visual) in what we might call the second act.If you aren't that jaded, or you want more emotional depth in your movie-going experience, or your sense of beauty just hasn't been blunted, you shouldn't miss Hanna. Ultimately, I think Hanna herself would have liked the film: she had not lost her sense of wonder and her sense of beauty.",Hanna
307,leminhha93,False Advertising,5,26 December 2011,"Hanna appears under IMDb's recommendation section for just about every action movie I was browsing. Seeing that the film got a 7.1/10 (at the time) I decided to buy the DVD, which just freshly arrived at the shelves.The film starts off well. We are introduced to a pretty Nordic-looking girl, seemingly isolated from civilization, trained by her father into being a cold-blooded assassin for a mission and a destiny we would soon find out. This interesting premise, along with the beautiful cinematography of Northern forests and lakes covered in snow instantly intrigues the viewer.As soon as the beginning stage is over, the film goes down. I would not go into details of what's wrong, but plot holes, unnecessary scenes, unanswered questions plethora, absurd details that defy laws of physics and logic are what you should expect from Hanna.The acting is in no way spectacular. Saoirse Ronan gives a flat performance that does not deliver the complexities of Hanna's emotions, while Eric Bana's and Cate Blanchett's characters do not get much screen time to begin with.Overall, while IMDb's recommendations usually include worthwhile films, this is one of the rare let-downs I've experienced. If you decided to watch Hanna, it would be best to forget about IMDb's ratings and prepare to be disappointed.",Hanna
308,Joseph-Stevenson,Beautiful. Don't let the negative reviews repel.,8,30 November 2011,"I really wanted to watch this film but I didn't have the time when it was in theatres. So I recently treated myself to the Blu Ray copy. I decided to check the user reviews before watching it and was very surprised by the amount of negative feedback. The reviews were almost hate posts! So, I put the disc in with mixed expectations and afterwards, I sat, glued to the credits thinking ""what was their problem?!"" Truly a beautiful film. Don't set out expecting an action packed bad-ass picture (I think that was the problem with most of the negative reviewers). Though not as frequent as your everyday action film, the action scenes are just as exciting as ever. If you liked the fighting techniques in Taken, imagine a teenage girl pulling off moves just as hardcore, if not more. The visuals and sounds of the film are nothing short of artistic. I give it an 8 out of ten. Not the best film of 2011, but definitely not the worst.",Hanna
309,FattyBeltBuckle,This Is What Fairy Tale Movies Should Be Like,9,8 April 2011,"Wow. I was blown away. To be honest, I was hooked as soon as I had witnessed the frenetic trailer a few months ago. Plus, I'm a Cate Blanchett/Joe Wright fan. But regardless, I loved this movie on its own. Saoirse Ronan is phenomenal as the title character Hanna. Eric Bana is terrific as the father who raises her in the remote Finland forests. Raising her to basically be a superhuman assassin. But Hanna is growing up and the sheltered life can't last forever. Thus, the story begins. Cate Blanchett's agent character has a history with Hanna and her father. She is presently on the hunt for them, not stopping until Hanna is dead. The wicked witch, indeed. Joe Wright masterfully directs with beautiful photography and fantastic editing. (Not to mention the awesome music by the Chemical Brothers.) This is a wonderful movie that everyone needs to see.",Hanna

Only one of many things in this film that requires a bit more suspension of believe than I could muster. This film can't decide if it is an action movie, sci-fi (what's up with the genetic tinkering - we want to know more) or just plain old spy thriller. There's some excellent cinematography here, but the the movie just doesn't stick together.Their are scenes where the movie just comes to a halt, with the characters just staring at each other or off into space. That's punctuated by some seriously fun action scenes. It's worth a rental.",Hanna

He raises her with all of the skills necessary to kill a long time rival of his, Marissa Weigler(played by academy award winning actress, Cate Blanchette). Hanna flips the switch to a homing device that throws her into a world she doesn't understand or know. She must battle it out against, I would say, the most vicious people in the world. Brilliantly made and well acted. Saoirse Ronan brings a whole new vision of the world into light with her brilliant performance as Hanna. There is no flaw in her acting, not even once. She is believable as this character and leaves you stunned from start to finish. The film brings to mind a new way of looking at the world, through the eyes of a girl who never experienced the cruelty or love of it yet was trained her whole life to be ready for it. A wonderful new kind of fairy tale that leaves you stunned right to the finish. A+",Hanna
312,rickbarni-233-509919,Did someone from Production house actually watch it before launching???,1,9 May 2012,"6.9 IMDb rating??... Come on guys, give me a single reason for it. I cant believe one could produce such a sloppy stuff. And of-course it didn't come with 'screw your sense' tag line so I will oppose people who are saying 'dont go for detailing and watch the movie'.Come on, a born assassin, prepared to take down top agents does not know what is passport. She is not familiar with electricity, TV but can recognize the camera and quite aware of the importance of shooting them down. The research facility does not have guarded corners (even no cams) but some bunch of security personnel who run every here and there in groups. She did better than Chuck Norris in grabbing and leaving the Humvee. Weird girl got a weirder friend and much weirder parents who can discuss all the emotions and religion topics but didn't bother to ask how a girl with no penny and luggage is conducting her Morocco tour!!! And oh Mama!! A girl who saw electric switch for the 1st time went to cyber cafe next day and found out what her abnormal DNA report reveals.. Lesser talk about the rest of characters are better. Gum freak agent Marissa, Tranny Killer and his two punk sidekicks and of-course, Super assassin (or super Swimmer .. he just swam across the sea) Heller. I am a huge fan of Eric Bana but this was utter disappointing.Action scenes were pathetic, Hanna can overrun an entire Research facility security but cant take down the tranny. CIA agent holds his fire till Erik throws a knife. And the Tranny group decided to kill Erik with bare hands and in one by one fair fight.Now can anyone please explain me why it got such a high rating?? And even I saw reviews where people are quite convinced with the smart direction and screenplay. Have I watched the same movie????",Hanna
313,MFFJM2,"Wow, was this a waste of money",3,18 April 2011,"This film was derivative of many other films including (Soldier, Resident Evil), with little new in the way of plot. The immoral CIA creates a program in which they are attempting to genetically create the perfect soldier by fooling with the DNA of embryos. When the experiment proves successful (huh..? Why shut down a successful program..?) it is decided for unknown reasons to end the project and terminate all those involved. Eric Bana, the CIA field agent who recruited the women for the experiment has a change of heart and tries to save one woman and her child. For no particular reason, except to give Hanna a reason to want revenge later on, the mother is killed by Kate Blanchett, and Eric Bana escapes with the infant. Bana raises Hanna as his own in an ""arctic"" cabin without electricity or modern conveniences, in order to prepare her for the day that she has to face the CIA and their henchmen. The day finally arrives when Hanna decides that she is ready. Bana digs up a transponder he had buried and places it in front of Hanna quipping that once the switch is flipped it can't be undone. Since there is no electricity in the cabin, and in fact Hanna has never seen an electric light, the method by which Bana got a battery to operate after over 14 years is never explained. Bana leaves Hanna alone to be captured by the dastardly CIA operatives. He did this apparently in order for Hanna to kill Kate Blanchett. Why he doesn't take Hanna with him, instead of leaving her to be taken by the CIA is left unexplained. Hanna is brought to an underground holding cell, the size of the Superbowl, in Morocco.Strangely, Morocco looks a lot like the desert southwest of the US. Naturally, Hanna is more than a handful for the loutish CIA operatives and manages to escape through the ubiquitous air-conditioning vents which just happen to be her size. She makes her way to the surface, and just as she is looking out of a vast desert vista in broad daylight, Hummvees start driving directly over her head, apparently oblivious to the fact that there is an open submarine door in their path. As the last Hummvee passes the hole is shown as empty clearly showing that Hanna has managed to take hold of the undercarriage of the last vehicle as it passed at 50 mph, where she hangs on similar to Robert De Niro as Max Cady in the 1991 film ""Cape Fear"". Too bad nobody told the director about this same treatment by the ""Simpsons"" with Sideshow Bob. I'm sure I'm not the only one surprised by the location of Morocco for this CIA detention cell, instead of somewhere in the US. It becomes obvious later on when Hanna has the opportunity to show off her dexterity with languages, which wouldn't have come up in the US quite so easily. Also, since it was decided by the Director to have the final fight scene in an amusement park in Germany, the CIA detention center had to be someplace from which Hanna could conceivably get to Germany, without a passport or any ID.At one point in the film Eric Bana picks up a post card at a post office, apparently where they've been holding his mail for the past 14 years, and there's a postcard from Hanna telling him in code she has killed Kate Blanchett, which is unfortunately incorrect. How she bought the stamp, mailed the postcard, or knew which post office Bana would be near is unexplained. The fact that all of this action takes place in a matter of a few days, makes the idea that a post card can get from Morocco or Spain to Germany in that amount of time laughable to anyone who has lived overseas.There are several editing or continuity errors, like when Hanna kills the reindeer with a bow and arrow, but then guts a reindeer of approximately half the size, and then brings the originally sized reindeer home on a sleigh, apparently having made the sleigh from the raw materials by hand.The choice of where and when to use blood spatter effects is also interesting. Hanna gets her face splashed when shooting people, and the picture in front of grandma gets covered when Kate Blanchett kills her (again for no reason), but the reindeer is remarkably without blood, even though Hanna is in the process of gutting it.If you can willingly suspend your disbelief for this film, then you really have no disbelief to suspend.The story is derivative, the characters are two dimensional and without motivation, the lines are full of clichés, and the violence is unrealistic. Eric Bana is supposed to be the Zen like trainer of Hanna, but he can't seem to handle a Aryan Brotherhood with a knife. I suppose 12 year old girls will like the scene where Hanna flips a Spanish boy who tries to kiss her, but her reactions were closer to that of someone suffering from anti-social personality disorder than of a normal teenager.The fact that Hanna kills people for little or no reason would seem to suggest that she is in fact meant to be characterized as a serial killer, except that she announces to Eric Bana that she doesn't want to hurt anyone anymore, when all she really needs to do is to stop hurting people.I found it disconcerting that Eric Bana had spent 14 or so years training Hanna to kill everything that moves, when the CIA was unaware of his or her actual existence. He could just as easily have changed his name and raised Hanna on a ranch in Idaho or a tenement in the South Bronx, but then there wouldn't have been as much of a story, as such.",Hanna
314,beaulieu-sam,A solid thriller/action film,8,24 July 2012,"For those of you that think i have overrated this movie, i would agree with you. I am simply giving it a higher score to raise it's rating of 6.9 on IMDb, because i believe it deserves more than that.Hanna is about a young woman of 16, with super-human capabilities, given that she was a man made experiment to make a hybrid human that was smarter, faster, ETC. She is an assassin trained by her father, a supposed Ex-spy, to protect herself from her ""mother"" whom has been on the lookout for Hanna since she was born. Once Hanna has decided that she is done her training, she and her father set off a beacon sent directly to the mother who quickly takes advantage and begins her search. There were certain parts in this movie that seemed quite pointless however. To be specific, There was not much point showing us Cate Blanchette's character scraping at her teeth in the bathroom. And I also found it quite unrealistic that Hanna found civilization riding across part of the desert underneath the tank.To be honest, I think that this film deserved it's previous score on IMDb in the 7.5-7.9 range. It's plot may seem quite boring, and lacking at certain points, but personally, I think that Saoirse Ronan played the role of Hanna fantastically. She did a exquisite job and she gets two thumbs up for what she has done here. I think she an actor with much potential, as a matter of fact and she has done quite well in the starring roles of her last couple films. Cate blanchette was decent as well, and even though Eric Bana was not bad, he still fit the role. Even though there were many problems involving the plot, some character development and quite a few clichés, Hanna was better than I thought it was going to be. If you are craving a good thriller or action film, watch this. It certainly ends with a bang.",Hanna

Hard to believe it is the second film Clint Eastwood directed because it so well done and keeps you engaged for the entire film. What I like is the modern feel and utter lack of sentimentality so many Westerns exhibit. I have watched it over and over again.The cast is excellent, with outstanding character performances scattered throughout the film. An apparent take off on High Noon, but it is superior, IMO, because the gritty realism displays the hypocrisy we humans so often display in the face of danger. Self interest rules the day and the conflict that ensues make for great drama.Soundtrack outstanding. It has that quality of the great Seventies movies - modern, off beat, risky, but the chances taken all seem to work in this film. Between High Plains Drifter and Unforgiven, give me High Plains Drifter every day and twice on Sunday. It's a blast.",Hanna

318,ludwig1800,Avoid like the plague,1,18 March 2013,"During my life I have seen films which start off with a promising opening/basic introduction to the storyline, only to go downhill very quickly afterwards. Hanna is such a film.At the start of the film, there is beautiful scenery, and we are introduced to the environment which Hanna grew up in: desolate and isolated. In the real world, Hanna would have virtually no knowledge of technology. There is even a part in the film where she doesn't even know what music is! Also, this movie is kind of like Kill Bill meets the Discovery Channel, and Hanna isn't armed with a samurai sword.Then the plot begins to fall apart. We see ridiculous events happen, for example Hanna grabbing the bottom of a Humvee and riding it; if this had been real life she would've been killed instantly. She is terrified of a light bulb, but manages to use the Internet like a pro. And the scene where she is about to kiss a boy, only to beat him up, is just plain absurd. Also, she never seems to display the type of courage a ""teen assassin"" would show. Even though I didn't enjoy Kick-Ass, the movie shows another teen assassin, Hit Girl, who isn't afraid to take on her enemies head on. On the contrary, Hanna RUNS away from her enemies, accompanied by thumping techno music (I do like the Chemical Brothers, but even the score was average). And Cate Blanchett changing accents... What the hell? One of the baddies, who is, you guessed it, German (Honestly, I am so sick of the Germans being portrayed as the baddies)is going around whistling a tune, just like the guy in Kill Bill. The final showdown is absolutely ridiculous: When all seems lost, a bow and arrow appears out of NOWHERE and Hanna wins.While Saorise Ronan is attractive, this movie actually made me lose faith in her. Atonement was OK, The Lovely Bones had its moments, but was a big, resounding ""meh"", and Hanna was awful. It seems like she, like Nicholas Cage, is being ""typecast"" into terrible movies. I saw in the cinemas that a new film with her in the title role has just come out. Frankly, I have no desire to see it.",Hanna
319,alaskabarb808-116-604232,"I enjoyed this movie, but ...",7,25 May 2020,"First, I'm just an average viewer, not a fledgling movie critic, and these are just some random observations I had while watching.The main actors are all accomplished, and the movie contains interesting scenes in Finland, Morocco, and a derelict German amusement park. The soundtrack by the Chemical Brothers was different, varied, and fit some scenes very well- IMHO, especially duringHanna's escape from the underground military facility somewhere in the Moroccan desert, and a weird, sort of David Lynch-ian scene of weirdos loitering in the Berlin bus station.
Cate Blanchett's ultra-sophisticated poisonous green Armani wardrobe sometimes held my attention as much as the plot; (I mean, maybe her side job as an assassin helped pay for those $800 green kidskin gloves.)
And about the plot. Okay, suspension of disbelief and all that - but I kept wondering, if Hanna wanted to experience the world outside of the arctic, why didn't she (and Eric, for that matter) just go? They'd been off the grid for 15 years, and no one was actively looking for them; they could have slipped away and lived for months or years anonymously anywhere. Instead, inexplicably, they decide to trip an ELT locator beacon, and immediately alert Marisa Weigler as to their whereabouts. It was such a 'duh' moment, that I kept thinking about it throughout the movie.
That being said, I still watch it whenever it's on cable, so I'll admit it's fairly good, despite any flaws.",Hanna

Here came a chance for Eric Bana and not only he lets it go but also spoiled his earlier image of a good actor. Cate Blanchett and Saoirse Ronan are amazing in terms of acting. Plot is so old that there is nothing new in it. Actually this is the one movie where no body can write a spoiler, there is nothing to give away. Direction is so bad that there is a scene where a motorcyclist is chasing a car and director wants some dirt to fly from motorcycle's back wheel onto the camera so he just puts a small amount at the back of the wheel to fly whileits in the camera view that rest of the road is super clean. First part of the movie is still bearable but second part looks like that director was in a utter hurry to turn a movie into a B grader. It kills my heart to see that now a days such bad movies have IMDb rank of 7.0. It is in no comparison to movies like Bourne Trilogy, or Enemy of the State. Even if we see the science spin on it (which was an attempt to get a USP on an age old plot) is way boring than Limitless, Inception or Source code.",Hanna

323,jullashanghavi,The Good and the Bad,6,10 April 2011,"I was excited when I saw the trailer for 'Hanna'. It seemed like a fresh departure from the norm.THE GOOD: This film had wonderful cinematography. The lighting was just beautiful, and many of the scenes were a joy to watch...for myself, it was eye candy. The acting of lead actress, Saoirse Ronan, was just excellent. At her age, she was able to capture a sense of innocence, ruthlessness and confidence flawlessly. And of course, I could never forget the brilliant soundtrack. The Chemical Brothers did for 'Hanna', what I felt Daft Punk did for 'Tron:Legacy' - they enhanced the atmosphere of the film as a wholeTHE BAD: While I absolutely loved many aspects of this film, I just cannot get over the numerous plot holes. Firstly, why did Hanna need to signal to Blanchett's character that she was alive and coming out of hiding? Knowing the power of Hanna, why didn't Blanchett use her common sense and get more police or get the government involved in capturing her and putting her in a place that she couldn't actually escape from? The idiot hooligan killers seemed unnecessary, and i didn't quite understand who they were and where they came from (or how they were qualified). By the end, the lack of answers to my questions just left me agitated. Moreover, while I guess Blanchett and Bana acted well in their roles, they seemed rather forgettable to me. Lastly, I wish there were more action sequences. The trailer set it up to be very Tarentino-esque (almost like 'The Bride' in Kill Bill), but I have to say, this film fell short.While I loved certain aspects of this film, I feel like I cannot forgive the underdeveloped plot. It had so much potential...I really really wanted to love this film. Perhaps my expectations going into the film were way too high.",Hanna

325,kschang77,"Unclear ""mission"" left me somewhat disappointed",7,3 April 2011,"Watched Hanna at a sneak preview screening in San Francisco. Overall, the movie is fine, though the unclear character motivation was a bit confusing and detracted from the overall enjoyment. The character of Hanna (Ronan) seem to be influenced by quite a bit of anime, but certainly fresh for American mainstream cinema. Miss Ronan did a good job switching between the soldier's ""thousand yard stare"" and the wild-eyed wonder of a child who had not seen the world (though heard/read about it). It's also refreshing to see a girl who did not use a single bit of sexuality to do what she needs. The character of Erik (Bana) is a general Bourne-influenced tough guy, nothing else came across. He's a secondary. The character of Marisa (Blanchett) as a ruthless ""heavy"" is... rather one-dimensional. She's the primary heavy, but she recruited a bunch of secondary heavies along the way. The action sequences are generally made quite well, with good hand-to- hand combat sequences, but there's a bit too much MMA / Wrestling moves like flip / body slam. Not quite enough gunplay or weapons play, IMHO, but it's still interesting. The main problem I have with the movie is about character motivation. What exactly was the protagonist's mission? Was it simply to kill ________? If so, why? There was zero hints on what she's ""ready"" for, or why. They could have fixed that with only a sentence or two. Same with the antagonist. What was her motivation? The motivations are the biggest problem in this movie. There were also a couple goofs (one's already documented) that I have issues with. Overall, the movie is enjoyable, if you can rationalize the mission, the motivations and its aftermath.",Hanna

327,jaycp1979,Brilliant Film. Brilliant Cast. Ignore any negative reviews...,9,17 May 2011,"I'm confused. I really am. After having watched this quite simply fantastic film the other night, I find myself puzzled by questions raised by other reviews posted on here, but before we get into that here's my take on the movie. From the off its evident that this film is superbly put together, the cinematography, the awesome Chemical Brothers soundtrack and the solid casting. Whilst its budget is perhaps only a fraction of what the next Michael Bay blockbuster might have, it pulls no punches and engrosses throughout. Indeed, I believe it benefits from this, resulting in eye catching, fluid, well delivered action scenes down to intimate bonding moments captured under a blanket between 2 teens exploring themselves and their budding friendship. If you're going to cinema to see a balls out, banging from start to finish action thriller. Don't bother as you will be disappointed But if you're after an action thriller that is charatcer driven and will, without question, hold your full and absolute attention for all 111 minutes, then leave you wanting a sequel then this is the one for you. Its almost like a Bourne film crossed with coming of age film and a sprinkling of comedy. Now, for the questions raised by people, who, to be fair must have been watching a different film. 1 – The escape scene. Hanna was able to grapple onto the bottom of the Humvee 'Cape Fear' style as this girl has been modified, has no fear and superior reactions/strength. OOh... and she has been training for the last 16 years. According to the film. 2 – Why was there a scene with Marissa showing her cleaning her teeth to the point of bleeding. Well, I'd hazard that this was an effort to show the character has an acute sense of attention to detail and is, perhaps, unflinching in her self conduct? 3 – Why does Marissa want to kill Hanna anyway? Well, again I'd hazard that its perhaps because she is the last and only survivor from a CIA funded programme, of which Marissa was in charge, and could potentially 'whistle blow' on the whole operation and the fact that Marissa had everyone else on the programme murdered.. not sure that's gonna to go down to well if it ever got out? Indeed, there is a scene in which Marissa asks a camp, short wearing killer to do things for her that the 'agency wouldn't allow' I mean seriously people, its all up there on the screen. If you're asking these sorts of questions then you should stick to watching 'little fockers' or 'bambi'. Hanna. A film I would recommend to all.",Hanna

On one side was the part where you hear the awesome soundtrack blare and know a good fight is about to happen.The fights were enjoyable, maybe unrealistic, such as when Eric Bana's character fights I think 5 agents ? He somehow manages to annihilate them, despite receiving just as hard of punches as he was throwing from two or more agents. The scenery of Morocco and the eerie playground in Berlin were great ! However, on the other side was a plot with huge gaps ! Nothing is really explained well, and what happened to the family she hitched a ride with ? The whole Spanish scene was unimportant and didn't really add anything in my opinion, except she may have had strong feelings for her friend and the friends brother was in love with her.

The style the movie was done in is certainly very interesting. The portrayal of a girl who has been isolated from normal society for most of her life was also pulled off very well. The initial scenes in the forests of the Arctic (if I am not mistaken) was too slow in my opinion. Also the overall plot of the movie is very thin. One thing that does stand out about the movie however is the soundtrack. Composed by the Chemical Brothers, they have managed to bring together the main elements of the movie almost perfectly in their melodies.Don't expect too much from the movie in terms of story though. I like the director's style and hope to see him behind the camera with a more substantial script.",Hanna
331,mad-bout-movies,Don't expect much Action...,5,9 June 2011,"I don't normally write reviews but based on the fact there is so much positivity around this movie I thought it only fair to add a more balanced review.Hanna starts off well, a great premise, a baby genetically modified to be stronger, without fear or pity, much like a politician that works out, and a ex-spy father who trains her from an early age on the way of the assassin. The lead up from her forest home builds well and right up until the point where Hanna wastes a bunch of US military personnel and goes on the run everything is looking good.But then we're led through an emotional coming of age drama as Hanna learns about electricity, friends and her origins. There is very little action from this point onwards, a bit of hand to hand combat but ultimately we're following Hanna discover her past. Much is left unexplained, for example, what happened to her one and only friend, did the bad guys kill her or did they let her and her family continue on their merry way? What was the American agent from hell's objective, to recruit Hanna, kill her...? I found myself at the end of the movie uttering out loud, is that it? Genuinely surprised the movie was over.I suspect you'll enjoy this movie if your expectations are appropriately set, DO NOT expect lots of action scenes with a young female Leon cutting her way through bad guys, if however your looking for a lightly actioned thriller then you'll most likely enjoy Hanna. I've heard reviewers compare this to Kill Bill, I have to disagree, quite simply, Kill Bill was full of action sequences, this movie has one or two but they are all short lived.",Hanna
332,bramkleiweg,"Ronan, Wright and The Chemical Brothers",10,4 July 2011,"It is great to see that there are still directors out there who dare to reinvent themselves. Genre-spanners, like Spielberg and Kubrick (once) were. After the emotionally intense - but sometimes slightly melodramatic - 'Pride and Prejudice' and 'Atonement', as well as the cringingly sentimental 'The Soloist', Wright has blown us away. 'Hanna' entertains and impresses on a completely different level than the director's previous work. The visual style, the lighting and camera-work, consists of a mixture of goose bump-sterility and sweltering heat: the former during scenes of brutal combat, the latter during moments of happiness and affection. This literal translation of emotions to the visual style of a film is something that Tom Ford's saturated shots also achieved in 'A Single Man', but in a primitive manner when compared with that which Wright demonstrates here. The beauty of the frames is complemented on a near synthetic level by The Chemical Brothers' soundtrack. The tones and beats enhance the scenic moods in a manner not unlike Air's equally brilliant soundtrack for 'The Virgin Suicides'.But the most astounding contribution of all is made by the cast, led fearlessly by Saoirse Ronan. The 17-year old actress has impressed in the past (including in Wright's 'Atonement'), but with 'Hanna' she has clearly introduced a broadening of horizon considering her work. Ronan presents us with both true grit and heartfelt emotion whilst keeping her character fully in check at all times; she gives an incredibly solid and multifaceted performance. Her fellow cast members - including Cate Blanchett, Eric Bana, Olivia Williams and Tom Hollander - deliver decent (Bana) to amazing (Hollander) work. During a certain scene, Hollander's whistling is matched perfectly by the aforementioned soundtrack and his twirling of a led pipe whilst he is seen walking through an ominously presented danger zone of a hangar. It is something that has to be seen to be believed.This movie will not disappoint. I especially implore those of you to go who would usually go to see films such as 'Transformers 3' and 'Fast Five', so that you can experience the manner in which an action-laden film can have a true heart whilst pleasuring the eyes and ears in a more exciting and progressive way.",Hanna

When i finally got round to seeing it, lets just say i was relieved i did not pay to watch it. Had heard good things about this film at the time. Now wondering did we watch the same film or is there a similar named film out there. This film feels like it has being hacked to pieces in the editing room. Not enough of a back story on main characters. Overall the acting and script are very poor in this film. Saoirse Ronan is OK but everyone else here are an embarrassment especially the bad guy German dude and his skinhead gang. Truly awful and annoying really. This film is a mess. It really is.

339,nb-38,Dante should create a new circle of Hades for the perpetrators of this flick,2,19 April 2011,"I want my money back--with punitive damages for insulting my intelligence.Let's start with what seems to be the premise: An ex-CIA agent raises his daughter to be an expert assassin.Mr. Master-Killer raises his daughter in the remote wilderness of Finland, and, while we see he spends a great deal of time instructing her on the fine-points of deception, killing, general mayhem, blue whales and supernovae, (the latter two *so* important in the everyday workings of espionage and assassination. Great for a well-rounded education, though), it never seems to have occurred to this so-called super-spy that she may need to actually *experience* civilization: At one point we see the girl marveling at a fluorescent light--to the amazement of an innkeeper. Hanna mentions to said innkeeper how she believes electricity was *invented* by Thomas Edison. Huh? What?So much for a well-rounded education.Hanna doesn't know civilization, people, conversation, propriety--anything, really, beyond killing efficiently and without mercy.While Saoirse Ronan is superb in her role as an innocent(?) miscreant, Cate Blanchet--an otherwise unique and dynamic actress--struggles with the character she portrays, and one can only wonder what evil stroke of nature forced her to take the role. Eric Bana is his usual, banal self, and--much like his appearance in Star Trek--could have phoned in his boring, lackluster performance.This travesty was scripted by two writers having almost no credits between them: Seth Lochhead and David Farr. Having suffered through this disgrace, I can only conclude that they must live in their respective Mommys' basements and really, really, desperately need to get out more. At the very least, they need to start reading. Anything. Anything at all--which they clearly don't. The writers show little knowledge of the world as you and I know it, and are absolutely clueless as to the workings, intrigues and procedures of the intelligence community. They are equally clueless as to what make a good script.As, apparently, are the producers.The writing is abhorrent; the film-work, competent though visually dismal; the premise, fascinating; the execution of the premise, awful.And--the least annoying thing in a film chock full of annoying things, but indicative of the film's total disregard for reality, (and the intelligence of the audience)--why couldn't they even get the CIA's logo right?My advice: Spend your time watching something better thought-out, researched, written, and far more cerebral.The Three Stooges comes to mind.",Hanna

The most shamelessly boring movie i've seen in years. It tries to be artsy, but u will find better street art in any metropolis. It tries to have up-tempo action scenes with techno music, but techno is cheap and tempo is mid-paced at best. The story is thin and the screenplay is bubble-gum. If u have seen any episode of Dark Angel, then u've seen this movie. If I cut this film it would fit in ~46 minutes. At least then it would be suitable for 2 AM TV showing between the infomercials. In fact, let's take it a step further: I would take the first act with Hanna hunting in the Winter Wonderland, then cut to the scene where she looks in the window at the scary witch's eye, then to the scene where Hanna shoots the witch in self-defense. That's the entire freaking movie! The rest of it is drawn-out filler and all the other characters are irrelevant.

The story revolves around a girl contacting civilization for the first time and certainly not about a stone cold killer seeking revenge for the murder of her mother. Hanna was trained to be a deadly assassin and execute her mission. Instead she behaves like an average clueless girl would when she is thrown into the real world.

344,giles-hearn,"Derivative, inconsistently plotted and stylistically self-conscious.",4,4 June 2011,"I'm normally influenced by the opinions of respected critics such as Roger Ebert. If I'm in two minds whether to watch a movie and Roger gives it 3 stars or more, I will probably go and see it. And Roger is usually not far off the mark. In this instance, though, I think the old fella has lost the plot a little. 3-and-a-half stars out of 4?Perhaps Roger, like many of us, has been gradually dumbed down after years of lacklustre Hollywood remakes and style-over-substance music video direction. If you don't keep a record in your head of what is really good and what isn't, you too can be sucked into the vacuum.So, what is good? It's subjective of course, but you can start knocking stars off for the obvious. Lack of Originalty - Kick Ass, Leon, Run Lola Run, The Bourne Identity etc. All done before. All done better. Minus one star. Plot holes - Hanna is full of them. Too many to count. After a while, they start to annoy. Minus one star. Style - A tricky one this. Style generally comes without trying. It kind of just exudes from a picture. It's either there or it isn't. In Hanna, it's fake, pasted-on style. It's pretentious. Minus half-a-star. Acting - Only the lead character gives a creditable performance. The rest are just cartoon characters. Minus one star.I could go on, but already we are down to a meagre half-star out of four. Bad enough to appear in Ebert's next ""Your movie sucks"" edition.I recommend you go and see Hanna. And when you get home, take a step back and analyse what you just saw.

Frankly, this just isn't the case for Hanna. Grabbing on to a Humvee going 50 mph from a hole in the ground. Beating up trained fighters twice your size. Shooting arrows over a distance of at least 30 feet without a bow. Just a few of the huge inconsistencies in this movie. Not to mention the ability to freak out over tea pots, ceiling fans, and lights, but still being able to use a complicated computer my grandfather still hasn't been able to figure out.Then there's the story, if you want to call it that.

346,pjpoconnell,"""Hanna"" is a combination",8,10 April 2011,"""Hanna"" is a combination of action thriller (spy division), coming-of-age story, Grimm fairy tale, and sci-fi. It's an ambitious undertaking that's hard to bring off--and that probably explains some of the quirkiness in the film. It also explains why the film is so compelling and stays with one after one has seen it. The performance by Saoirse Roinan was terrific. To see such an ethereal creature kicking ass from Finland to Morocco to Spain to Germany was a delight. Eric Bana was rather good. (I haven't liked him in other things that he's done.) Cate Blanchett was also good, and I do think that her on-and-off accent was a deliberate device to display the character's manipulative nature. The English family was wonderful, and those impressed by Jessica Barden's performance as the teenage daughter should see ""Tamara Drewe,"" where she made her very amusing debut. She, like Saoirse, is obviously destined for stardom. People should bear in mind that Natalie Portman started on her path to stardom at age 12 when she played an assassin in ""The Professional."" The production design of the film added much to it-- particularly the weird structure where Hanna is interrogated, the even weirder actual landscape of Morocco, and today's Berlin, which looks like NYC of the '70s and '80s. Ugh! Finally, Hanna did have a human mother (embryo provider), and it wasn't Marissa.",Hanna

The camera work and sound kept me glued.There seems to be quite a few reviews that talk of all the gaps in logic and reasoning in the movie.

The script also has interesting plot twists.Hanna,the 16-year-old heroine,is an eerie girl,in both senses of the word;she is sensitive and lethal at the same time: she is able of caring for her friends and killing a person in a heartbeat with her bare hands without even blinking! She is shrewd but not shrewish. Her character is full of antitheses and multi-dimensional. The direction is inspired and makes good use of filming locations (Morocco,Spain,etc.)and ethnic music.The score isn't pleasing for my taste,but it matches the fast pace of the movie.A memorable scene shows a male agent praying out loud for his life at the sight of the stone-cold face of Hanna!A worthy film overall.",Hanna

351,imdb_expert,horrific mix of road movie/feelgood/Jason Bourne intended for 10yr old girls,2,27 August 2011,"The first 10 minutes i thought this was going to be a good movie. Little girl being trained to be the ultimate killer. Could it possible be better than the Bourne movies? Then suddenly the girl starts talking about music and emotions, American actors dressed up as Moroccan and Spanish gypsies start dancing, singing and playing guitars. During the whole movie there are techno children songs playing. The little girl (she's supposed to be 15 but she looks like 10) is walking through the American desert when suddenly she's inside an Arab village. Huh? It took me a while to realize that it was supposed to be Morocco, because the desert scenes have the iconic rocks from America. Its like putting the Egyptian pyramids in a movie and then pretending its an American desert. The Americans-dressed-as-arabs had such poor disneylandish costumes that i thought it was part of the movie that she walked onto a movie set. So there is a little girl walking into an arab town. Since when is normal in Arab villages for blonde girls to walk around half-naked? None of the arab men, boys and women acknowledge her existence, even when she stares at them and just randomly sits at peoples lunch tables. Could this movie get any more realistic? Yes, the girl meets tourist children, starts driving around on motorcycles with the local boys, all the while having deep conversations about god and buddha with the new-age tourist mother, and she almost starts a lesbian relation with the tourist daughter.As this all is taking place, the CIA decides to send the best of the special forces after her: 3 Neonazi British men from a strip-club. During the whole movie the girl and her father kill navy seals in a matter of seconds without problem and they avoid bullets and do other superhero things(though you never get to see any of these scenes, the camera just switches off whenever something is about to happen) yet when confronted with 3 drunk neonazis from a strip-club(one of which uses a cane to walk), they fight and fight and have major problems to avoid a punch in the stomach. And another punch. And another one. How good would the jason bourne movies have been if he got his ass kicked by a a drunk homeless guy?Meanwhile the girls father is supposed to be the good guy of the movie. He saved the girl from the CIA when she was a baby, is now in Europe randomly killing local cops that enter his line of sight, but have nothing to do with the CIA and are just out to do parking tickets. One of the best scenes of the movie is when he tells the girl he isn't really her father, that she comes from a test-tube experiment, that he killed 19 other women just like her mother and 19 other girls just like her. He finishes it by saying he loves her. A serial killer, child-killer and cop-killer, how is that supposed to be a good guy?This movie really was a roller-coaster ride for me, it went from promising the first 10 minutes, to extremely childish and absurd literally in the space of 1 minute. It happened so fast that i could actually feel my emotions die. I wanted to look up the directors name so that i would never have to watch anything from him again. I do think however that perhaps the little girl is behind much of the plot of the movie. Just imagine what a 10yr old girl would like to see in a movie, and it suddenly starts making sense: ""A colorful arab town with only nice people, everyone is happy, it is such a mysterious and fun disneyland place like all arab towns no? Camels are fun! What people are bad? Neonazis are! So lets put some neonazis in the movie! How to make it scary? Make one of the neonazis whistle children's songs! Oooooh scary."" Etc.To sum it all up: fun for little girls only. I gave it 2 stars because the first 10 minutes were OK.",Hanna

But the storyline was thin, the action was alright, I was expecting something more. They also had the second storyline, with her (Hanna), and this other British girl which only just slightly displayed some character development. The secret background story was lead up to be something unimaginable, when really it was exactly what you were expecting, though I did give it a 5 out of 10 simply based on the fact that i though it was delivered in a way that keeps you interested and involved, and that really is the only thing to keep you watching.",Hanna
353,themovingpic,Saoirse Ronan is a rare talent.,7,9 October 2011,"Hanna is a film directed by Joe Wright who previously directed Saoirse Ronan in Atonement, to which she received an Academy Award Nomination for Best Supporting Actress. It is great to see the two of them working together again.What I admired about Hanna was how the opening scene is significant and is later on revisited at the end of the film. We are introduced to Saoirse Ronan's character, Hanna, who in the first scene is hunting a deer. She shoots the deer with an arrow and approaches the dying animal and says ""I just missed your heart"", there is remorse and sadness in her voice and without hesitation she pulls out her gun and ends its misery. At the end of the film she shoots Cate Blanchett's character, Marissa, with another arrow. Hanna fixates her cold eyes on the bleeding body and once again says, but this time without any remorse or sadness, ""I just missed your heart"", and shoots her with her gun –film ends. I really appreciated and found it clever as to what the director and writers did with these two scenes. Hanna saw Marissa as 'the hunted' just as she hunted the deer in the beginning; but her feelings towards the two, as she shot them, differed from each other.Saoirse Ronan, who plays Hanna, is remarkable and full of rare talent. Her accent in this film or in any film for that matter is accurate and clear-cut. Not too long ago I discovered that she actually has an Irish accent. I've seen her previous films such as Atonement and The Lovely Bones and I have come to enjoy seeing her take on these disturbing roles. She seems to take on characters that are usually troubled and have something dark surrounding them which is quite a mature move for such a young actress. I adore her dedication and seriousness when it comes to choosing particular roles in film.Continuing on with the film, I liked how Hanna and her father, Erik (Eric Bana), were introduced. We were given a montage of Hanna training with her father. The scene where her father asks her to speak in three different languages just blew my mind. Saoirse Ronan was believable when she spoke in Italian, Arabic and Spanish; all of which was convincing and what made the film for me. Another thing that made this film outstanding was the soundtrack! Every time a scene was about to break into action, you would hear an electronic score. It made the film all the more exciting, especially in one scene when Hanna fights her way out of a facility; you hear the electronic rock music start to play and your heart starts to pound to the beat of it.One part of the film that I was very fond of was when Hanna was on the run from the intelligence agent and trying to rendezvous with her father in Berlin. While on the run she was introduced to an unfamiliar world. She became stowaway in a family's RV and was able to experience, even if it were for a day or two, the life of a regular kid. She was raised in the forest since she was a baby and grew up never knowing of what it is like to have a friend or to laugh with a family and to spend time with and (almost) kiss a boy! She was deprived of all this and it was nice to see her enjoy her youth, even if it were only for a few moments.I suggest you see this film for yourself. Cate Blanchett is always incredible in her films and I find her quite eerie and ruthless in this film as the intelligence agent, Marissa. Eric Bana had a few scenes in which he was able to show off his fighting skills and they were undoubtedly entertaining, I mean have you seen him in Troy? But overall if you're going to see this film, it really has to be for Saoirse Ronan. She is an exquisite actress and has this peculiar and unnatural look about her but I think it absolutely works with every character and role she plays in a film.",Hanna
354,ismarril,artistic Jason Bourne,5,27 January 2012,"*Contains spoilers* This movie tries to be taken seriously as an action piece, but fails. Were it creatively campy like KillBill or another Tarantino movie, it would work, but the plot holes, character feats and dialogue do not suspend your disbelief, they actually enhance it.Hanna is supposed to be a gifted individual, but some of her feats are not portrayed in the most efficient way. We are too frequently asked to take the movie's word for what happens. Like when she enters a lan house without having experience with any level of modern technology and timidly interacts with the internet, but in a span of seemingly a few hours managed to pull a masterful internet research. She's gifted, we get it, but it should be better conveyed. In another scene, we have her opening a hatch and grabbing into a humvee's undercarriage at 50 mph.Another of the movie's flaws is the frequent use of Deus Ex Machina as plot device. The confrontation scene at the end is plagued. Hanna is running from the the villain (Marissa) on the amusement park. Hanna sprints, jumps and deftly steps across the debris, and Marissa, wearing a ridiculously tight skirt and heels, shows no clear sign of falling behind. Marissa decides to take a mysterious path and appears in Hanna's way, blocking the escape while our heroine is conveniently left standing at a railway surrounded by murky water with nowhere to go but back. This is where the movie looks itself in the mirror and recognizes the railroading it has depended on.Marissa draws the gun and shoots, while Hanna reacts with an arrow she had from her friend's house (while ignoring a kick ass machete that was lying around from what we could see at an earlier scene), so Hanna slings the arrow with an invisible chord from the tip of her elbow (a skinny elbow, to be precise) and shoots back, the two of them landing a hit on each other.Hanna groans and picks herself up, to find Marissa had vanished in mere seconds without a trail, apparently having worn Frodo's ring or given a head's up by the camera guy to walk behind the screen while Hanna is left to gather her wits and start running again. The chase is resumed when Marissa is again at Hanna's heels, and when our heroine is about the be mortally shot, the villain slips and dies.If you sit to watch a photographic and musically dense movie, you *will* be entertained. Joe Wright, the director, managed to squeeze every bit of personal art concept he wanted. It delivers.Some characters and scenes are purposefully archetypal, but many viewers might mistake them for clichés. Be mindful.Another redeeming quality is how Hanna's intimate world evolves through the story. Her amazement with civilization and the people she meet is akin to a feral child making contact with human culture in the most tender fashion. Her alienated upbringing is calmly dissolved and her fascination juts palpable with the aesthetic competence of Joe Wright.Avoid this if you're looking for an action movie, but if you're into movie school or a sensitive story, you will probably be satisfied.",Hanna

Stupid plot, ludicrous one dimensional characters, and a plot with zero logic. What we have here is a girl trained from birth to be a super-soldier, expert in guns, killing, martial arts, survival, a genetically engineered killer, who after escaping from an underground bunker by single-handedly taking out dozens of machine-gun-totting soldiers with just her fists and a pistol, spends the rest of the film running away from two moronic bovver-booted skinheads led around by a poncy fop, dressed in casual sports gear.

361,scott-254,"Excellent performances, yet surprisingly bad",4,21 April 2011,"When seeing most movies, and especially action thrillers, you have to suspend disbelief to some extent. Unfortunately the screenplay and director for Hanna get progressively more lazy, forcing you to suspend even the un-reality you were supposed to accept at the beginning. The film starts well, and the performances by Saoirse Ronan, Eric Bana (stiff as a board, but that fits), Cate Blanchett and a cast of English character actors are are engaging, if not deep. Between that and the excitement generated by the overall style the movie is shot with, you get pulled in and want it to be good. Unfortunately, any time the hyperspeed pace requires tension, all character development and rationality are ditched in favor of Hollywood cliché scenes (torture, chases, bare-knuckle fighting). For example, why, after dispatching the best-of-the-best armed secret agents, does Eric Bana's character ('Eric') struggle with an un-armed Neo-Nazi thug and his Cabaret- running sicko mentor, and to top it off, he doesn't hear someone coming behind him (across a vast vacant lot, in heels), despite that kind of awareness being central to the first part of the film, because he is too busy with his Street-Fighter style coup-de-grace dispatching of an unconscious badie. That is just an appetizer for the final battle, where our super-human, super-trained protagonist flees haphazardly from the self-same foot-wear challenged mortal, only to be hunted down in the most vulnerable location possible...Once you realize how much the action sequences let you down, you look back and realize that you don't care that much, because the efforts to build emotional attachment to the characters was ham-fisted and abandoned when it because moderately difficult to fit into the ""plot"". There was a family of ""normal"" people, cultivated early on to help bring Hanna in touch with humanity, but they were ditched and forgotten about as things moved on to brainless flight, action, and the inevitable, although poorly executed, killing of the bad guys.Go watch Bourne Identity and/or The Professional (or even Serenity) if you want to experience what Hanna tries, but fails, to achieve.",Hanna

And some of them really hit exactly in the point saying that they were angry leaving the cinema.. I will not comment much on the movie, some guys already did this in an excellent way, just to mention a few stupid scenes in case i prevent some guys to go and give their 8 euros.. A 40 kgr girl manages to escape from a bunker of well trained commandos, the leader 'Kate on high heels' recruits some clowns from a bar (a retired tennis player with a fat ass/belly and a couple of skinny skinheads) to capture and take down the formidable Hanna, the most wanted dead Eric Banna gets surrounded by 5-6 trained agents and instead of trying capturing him with the aid of guns they prefer to demostrate their Bruce Lee techniques, Eric Banna prepares his wannabe killing machine daughter to kill but purposely leaves aside every single detail of technology knowledge (such as light of a bulb)... Now imagine her fighting with a bad guy and the bad guy pulls out a ...torch to her... She would freeze and say ""wow, what is this ???"" ""--punch on the face-- this is light!!!"". The list of stupidities is so long that there is no need to tell you more... And no, this is not the kind of crap that makes you laugh after a point and have a good time commenting on the silly plot etc... its the crap that makes you mostly angry..I just wonder how some companies/people manage to promote such stupid movies and many people just eat it..

364,ront-young,So So Movie,6,6 June 2011,"It's funny how a lot of people say whats's believable and what's not in films. You gotta remember people it's a film! Relax. I admit the movie was not the best, but it did have a few good scenes, I understood the fact that Hanna was a genetically enhanced embryo, therefore giving her special skills, which is why her father let her go on her own. The comment about speaking multi-languages, look at most spy films, they do the same. You have to be able to adapt in any environment. I felt the movie had less to do with revenge but Hanna growing up, and getting out of her sheltered existence. Everything was new to her, this is where they tried to give the character heart. I will however admit that some of the sequences with the teenage girl was a bit cheesy, but this was done in The Bourne Identity, Salt, and few other films. And the comment about turning on the switch, you have to remember it was at least 12 years later and who was to say that Cate's character was still in the same location. This was used to get into their compound and destroy Marissa. I think this film was trying to be a coming of age spy thriller but did not work on all levels. Oh, and the comment about a teenager taking on these guys who are specially trained, again remember she was and enhanced super soldier! Not a regular kid, pay attention the DNA info, if you failed to notice this then you missed the whole film. All in all I gave it 6 out of 10 because I felt they could have dulled down the teenage stuff and just had Hanna more on the run, and more fights! Oh and Cate's performance was OK, but not believable to me.",Hanna
365,lkayhew,"""Hanna"" could have been much better",5,4 September 2011,"This is my first feeble attempt at writing a movie review, despite being an active user for many years. I just had to say something about this particular film because I was really disappointed. I originally wanted to see it in theaters but never got the chance. I work at a video store so luckily I got the opportunity to sit down and watch it early before it comes out on Tuesday.By the end of the film, all I was thinking was ""um, okay? That's it? ...what?"" Pretty much. I mean, if you're a smart human being and care anything about plot, this movie is a bummer. However, if you fall into the general public category, most of which don't care about plot, then you will enjoy this...because it is just another sad case of ""looks cool but plot is absolutely terrible"". Other users commented about how there are gaping plot holes. This is very true. To me this is unacceptable. If a movie maker wants to make a movie, they should make it so it makes sense! Is that too much to ask? Hanna was honestly just frustrating to watch because I just kept asking questions about the plot that were never answered within a 2 hour period. The entire story doesn't really seem to have a point or make any sense. The only thing saving this film from being a total flop are the actors, but the 'terribleness' of this movie isn't their fault. All in all it's worth watching, I suppose, just don't have too high of expectations. This film could have been so much more than it is. Shame on the filmmakers for not fixing the gaping plot holes before releasing it.",Hanna
366,gzuhgut,"Slick, thrilling, art-house action film.",9,27 February 2012,"Having read some of the more negative reviews on this site, all I can say is that they all seem to have the same complaint in common. Namely, non-acceptance of certain plot contrivances. So let me say straight off: if you are the sort of person who didn't like Inception because it made no sense, or the sort of person who didn't like The Matrix Trilogy because it made no sense, or indeed the sort of person who didn't like any of David Lynch's films because (ahem) NONE OF THEM MAKE ANY SENSE...in short, if you are an incurable pedant, you will not enjoy this film and you might as well stop reading this review. Seriously, stop reading, don't watch the film and go calculate Pi or something.If, however, you have an appreciation for tightly-edited, emotionally engaging, aesthetically pleasing cinema with a brilliant soundtrack and at times breathless pacing, please allow me to take a few minutes of your time.Hanna is the story of a teenage girl who lives in total isolation with her father. She has vague memories of her mother, and these memories, combined with her (literally) encyclopedic knowledge fuel her desire to leave the relative safety of her father's protection in the frozen hinterland of northern Finland.In a way, I don't want to say any more than that. If you've read the other reviews on this site that give away more, then I'm very sorry for you, but if not then suffice it to say that her father's motivation for keeping her in this state of isolation appears to be protection, combined with a desire to train her in survival/assassination skills, in preparation for...well that would be telling. Of course, you don't need me to tell you that she leaves her father's protection and the story proper begins. As Chekov said ""One must not put a loaded rifle on the stage if no-one is thinking of using it"" and boy, does that rifle get used. Saoirse Ronan is brilliant as Hanna. At times seemingly invincible, at others pathetically vulnerable, owing to her complete inexperience of the world. We see the world from her unique perspective as she struggles to understand non-familiar interaction, the natural ease of recreation and even the basic electrical appliances that we all take for granted.The story moves us from one location to the next, painting a rich tapestry of colour and culture, whilst simultaneously (and somewhat comically) contrasting Hanna's desperate need to traverse these territories with the bourgeoisie's seeming obsession with ""experiencing"" as many of them as possible.The acting is solid throughout. The only truly great performance comes from Ronan, but Tom Hollander, Cate Blanchett and Eric Bana all turn out good performances that serve the picture well.However the true credit for this film has to be laid at the feet of Joe Wright. None of his previous films could possibly prepare you for Hanna. Wright's mastery of both a tight, intricate plot such as in Atonement, combined with his incredible skill in making this beautiful, thoughtful, action-packed coming of age story mark him out as a director of real class.It is true that Hanna suffers from a few plot holes, but that plot is delivered in such an appealing, exciting and above-all entertaining film that anyone who isn't compiling continuity errors for some god-awful TV programme that relishes in the fact that THIS ISN'T REAL LIFE, IT'S ACTUALLY ONLY A FILM!! should have a blast letting this film take them along for the ride. If you want reality, watch a documentary. If you want a very good fiction, watch Hanna.",Hanna
367,scribbler3,"Uneven, No Tempo",4,4 May 2011,"Why is this film getting any respect at all? Is it because the lead is such a striking, charismatic presence? Does the artiness of the camera work obscure the fact that it's simply a lousy action movie? The movie wastes a promising premise, a handful of good scenes, and Ronan's singular, often fierce otherworldliness. The bulk of the blame goes to director Joe Wright, whose work I've never liked--but the false notes he frequently strikes are even more apparent here, because there's nothing worse than a pretentiously arty director taking on an action film. The slow moodiness of the opening sequences is appropriate, and other moody digressions (especially her conversation with the Moroccan man) are effective. But this is an action movie with no tempo, no momentum, no rhythm. Action sequences are at times oddly sluggish, while non-action sequences are bizarrely pumped up with driving techno music. This is a potentially harrowing coming-of-age story with a protagonist who on the one hand can be a cold-blooded killer, and on the other is a sheltered innocent seeing the world with childlike wonder. But the resonance of that journey is undermined by the bizarrely cartoonish portrayals of her two chief antagonists. There is simply no coherent vision here--just an assemblage of ideas and technical flourishes and arty poses that never really comes together.",Hanna
368,failedihave,Here's how the movie got created,1,2 August 2011,"The Chemical Brothers made a couple of songs which were nice. The Camera guy had a few interesting ideas to share about different angle techniques and the writer had a one-liner saying ""I just missed your heart"". Then they got together and made this movie without adding much more to it.I will admit, I was going to write a more serious review but due to the fact that there were too much of those already I chose not to. The movie deserved a 4 or 5 out of 10 realistically but I could not dare to watch the current high rating of it anymore as it was misleading. Movies such as Cypher,Phone Booth and even Repo Men have a rating about 7 and this movie doesn't come even close near them. (If i can of course make a comparison amongst them)There is no point of criticizing the cast or the holes in the plot as they were really many as described in other reviews (don't get me started on those things). What I would suggest for someone who hasn't watched this movie is:If you have a lot of money to spare and don't care which movie you are going to watch - go for it.. watch it in the theater (if you are one of those people you wouldn't be reading this anyway)If you don't ....well ...wait for the DVD release and if you would like to see an odd movie with a lot of plot holes and moments that will make you wonder why you are still watching it but on the other hand a movie with interesting camera work and entertaining music(although i enjoyed it without the movie better as i got my hands on to the official soundtrack before watching the movie..imagine it even spoiled the descent music) then totally go for it but do not expect it to be a GOOD movie or one that is at least filled with a couple of fresh ideas because it is not.",Hanna
369,maplemale,"Good idea, good actors. Badly executed. Bad script, bad directing, horribly executed plot.",4,6 December 2011,"The idea and the trailer captivates you right off the bat. I love cast too. But honestly, this film was not well executed at all. Here's the issues that lead to a big letdown for me:1. I don't buy the super human strength aspect of the actress who plays Hanna. It's just not believable. They should have picked someone a little more muscular to play this part, or made her cunning and craftiness more believable while leaving out the strength aspect completely.2. The action scenes do not have an wow factor. They're right of a 1980s action film. They just make the character of Hanna even less believable. She's slow for one. When you see her beating up guys that are 5 times her size it's like they willing fall down for her.3. The idea of the plot is good. But the plot itself and the script is horrid. The first 20 minutes or so seem alright. But, it goes from Hanna being out in the middle of nowhere with her father to all of sudden being thrown into the real world in a CIA compound beating up agents with zero suspense, and little charter relationship building. Badly executed.4. As soon as the whole CIA compound thing is done, it goes into a long drawn out 45 minutes or more of her wandering around with this British family on a road trip. Wtf. That's the lamest thing ever and super boring. A 6 year old has more imagination than this. Horrible horrible plot at this point.5. The movie ends with her father dying and Hanna beating a bunch of people up. But somehow she has trouble beating up Kate Banchet's character - a 50 something year old pencil pushing CIA agent and then it ends with a completely predictable line from the beginning of the movie.

It comes over as an art-house indie film and the unnecessary shaky camera stuff (thank you Bourne 2&3)is just naff. The actors do their best with the material and the two female leads come up with pretty good performances but it was edited down to a 12A and there are just too many leaps of imagination needed to complete the film. The storyline is wholly contrived and the explanation for father and daughter coming out of their self-imposed exile is unsatisfactory. It degenerates into a standard road chase movie for a good proportion of it. Finally, Tom Hollander's character could have had so much more done with it - but really, this film was a wasted opportunity.",Hanna
372,nmichaud,The Professional and Brothers Grimm: Shake,10,10 April 2011,"I was overjoyed with Hanna. It did beg to suspend disbelief. A couple of plot and accent gaffes occurred. Regardless, I was swept away. The sound track and sound engineering are superb. This is the best sound, meaningful to the film, since Hurt Locker. Cate Blanchette got to do Gary Oldman's, Stansfield in a dress and with fine shoes. Her dental habits rival Josef Mengele. The film is psychologically terrifying with sound edits and quick edits. It is sound that terrifies not some lame fake blood. The violence in this film probably may do as much damage to human comfort as the death of Bambie's mother. I am still saddened after 53 years.The visual journey is wonderful. The small sidetracks amaze, are comic yet ominous. Anybody can spin an iron sci-fi set in final cut but no one simply emerges into a moonscape or a Spanish Gypsy band without thinking, Wow!Banan does not come close to Jean Reno. He never makes his character three dimensional but he is a dead man running.The bracketing theme, the Tales of the Brothers Grimm, is matchless. It gives depth and beauty to the film completely missed by filmmakers who just don't get how deeply terrifying and deep these dark fables are. Those dark fears are probably in our DNA.This is The Professional mixed in a blender with Brothers Grimm. The child conquers the nightmare. John Wright does not miss our heart and neither does Hanna.Wonderful film.",Hanna
373,mmercieca2,Disappointing,4,10 June 2011,"I chose to watch this movie as there wasn't really much else to watch. As it started out it seemed good. Great cinematography, decent acting and Hanna together with her father training in the mountains leaving you with a sense of 'I want to know what happens next'.When I found out what actually happens next I wasn't too impressed.Hanna is captured by the CIA while her father an ex CIA operative eludes the government agents by leaving before they arrive and is supposed to meet Hanna again in Berlin. She escapes captivity and is on the run, needless to say, with half the CIA chasing her and the other half chasing her father, for no seemingly valid reason.Another weak part of the plot was the importance the CIA gave to Hanna. Her portrayal as being a girl with 'super genes' and fighting skills comparable to those of Bruce Lee was in my opinion a failure. The profile just doesn't fit a twelve year old anorexic looking child.Don't get me wrong, the action in itself is decent, but the whole plot is muddled besides being full of holes. One example being Kate Blanchett, in her capacity as a CIA agent, hires three supposedly professional assassins to hunt Hanna down.All these three guys do is get beaten up time after time making it seem that they could not catch Hanna even if she was locked up in a room with them.Half way through was when I started getting really bored and actually contemplated leaving (which I rarely do). I felt I was watching a movie with a mistaken identity, one which at times would appeal to a child and not to an adult and at other times vice - versa.When the highly predictable finale arrived I had completely lost interest and looked up from my mobile with relief that I could finally leave.",Hanna

The film takes you into the point of view of a young 16 year old girl who has been raised her whole life in the isolated wilds of Finland by her father, Eric Heller, who had been training her to be a killing machine her entire life for the day when he lets her flip a switch to a homing device that summons his old rival, Marrisa Wiegler. Hanna, as soon as she flips the switch, is thrown into a world she doesn't understand and must battle it out against a ruthless woman and her henchmen. Saoirse Ronan puts forth another great performance as the young assassin, Hanna. I can't think of a single movie that she hasn't amazed me in. She puts so much character to this character that a lot of movies that are sort of like this never accomplish. She plays a character who's just experiencing the world for the first time and who's mind is clean and open to everything. She's the kind of character you don't quite ever see in movies these days and Ronan does a great job of bringing this kind of character to screen. A great film! That's pretty much all I can say about it. There's little to no flaw in it and amazingly entertaining. You will not regret going to see this film. It will blow your mind.

All of the actors turn in good performances but it just doesn't compensate for an insipid script: young girl raised in the wilderness to be the perfect assassin rebels against her masters. If you took out all of the running scenes in the film you'd be left with 20 minutes of bad dialog and atrocious sets: Why are the bad guys holding their hostages in shipping containers in a port? Because the DP thought it would make for an interesting visual (it doesn't). Multiple scenes in which a 95 pound girl holds her own in hand-to-hand combat with grown men who outweigh her by 100 pounds more than stretches credibility, it's just silliness repeated ad naseum.

You might have to decide for yourself why the program of genetics was shut down, or why Erik had to be killed, but in truth the movie is about Hanna, and the way she adapts to new environments and a new life. Yes there are plot holes, but you can watch Gladiator and see utter wrongs done to the portrayal of the Romans, or Star Wars with its space opera plot holes.

378,Knox3309,Not what I expected,8,9 September 2011,"When my girlfriend suggested renting this film for the evening I remembered hearing via word of mouth 'Its a bit like Bourne'. I didn't know how true this was but decided that even if it was a run of the mill action film I was up for that (after spending a day in the cold Cornish surf I didn't feel like having to think too much).It was about a minute through the film when we see a young girl from a low angle shot looking straight into the camera and saying "". . . I just missed your heart"". She then fires a pistol and the title screen of Hanna appears in unison with the sound of the gunshot. It was at this point I realised this isn't going to be your regular action flick.This thought was confirmed as the film plays out, but at times I found it could be difficult to determine what kind of film Hanna is. There are times when it seems like a coming of age story for the young protagonist as she spends time with a travelling English family in their camper van. Other times it seems like a taught spy mystery as we see Hanna and her father's past unravel, usually from the point of view of Cate Blanchettes icy antagonist. However as the trailer promises it is also has its share of action (although arguably less than you may expect) with fast paced editing, violence and some decent martial arts.And as much as I hate to admit it there where moments that are just a tiny bit like Bourne. For example Hanna's past being shrouded in mystery, or Eric Bana beating seven shades out of a group of enemy agents in an underground train station in Europe.In general I found the film was more surreal that I was expecting, but I found that this made it more gripping rather than causing the spectator to feel isolated. For example in a scene where Hanna is escaping an underground facility the, use of chiaroscuro lighting, fast editing and the chemical brothers soundtrack created an almost hallucinogenic effect.Overall after the film had finished I felt the same way as when I first saw the first Mad Max film, like there was more to come. However this film rounds of nicely with a repetition of the ""I just missed your heart moment"" which acts like a bookend on a shelf compressing 'Hanna' into a neat story in itself. Overall enjoyable action that goes deeper and is only a little bit, like Bourne.",Hanna

The comment from one was that the person who made this movie really just wanted to make a big music video, with another mentioning that one of the escape scenes was really over the top. Their views are both quite correct, but I LOVE big music and action scenes (see Tron: Legacy and The Fifth Element).The way the plot unfolds is interesting. The back story to the situation gets revealed bit by bit, keeping you hooked to see not only the end, but the beginning as well.My reason for giving it a 9 is mostly that the very last line of the movie is very predictable and lame. I also wouldn't consider this movie to be an absolute favourite of mine. It was great, but not awesome. Most of the plot and the individual scenes were top notch, but there were some areas that didn't seem to flow so well. There was also at least one scene where the entire room laughed.

I just had to register to review this overrated film. Saoirse's acting was great to be fair but Cate Blanchett and John MacMillan were awful. The character of Marissa as an all-powerful policewoman who is above the law was clichéd and boring. The 3 goons chasing after Hanna throughout the film were predictable as well. Above all the film just didn't make sense. When Hanna's 'father' left his little home in the forest why not take Hanna with him? Why all the drama of leaving her there for her to then kill Marissa. Surely, they could have escaped together to later find her and kill her.

If you are looking for a superbly acted, stylish, beautifully filmed, suspenseful action film with a good mystery and killer fight scenes, watch Hanna. Reminiscent of Run Lola run and Kill Bill, Hanna is one of the few contemporary films that really had me mesmerized and bewitched enough to watch it straight through, eagerly anticipating every scene, and sad that it ended when it did.",Hanna
384,ghetocandycane,A memorable tale of imagination and spirit. Lol just read the review..,7,12 August 2012,"So unexpected and well-scripted and directed. So different but beyond imagination in many ways. I recommend to anyone that loves suspense, drama and imaginative movies. But remember, when you watch it, it's not supposed to make sense at first. I also thought it was amusing in many parts, too. Sometimes even a tad peculiar. And you feel for Hanna and other characters as you would a real person. I think Saoirse Ronan should continue her career to very fine levels of work. What do you think? I think she would play a great Beatrice Prior in the upcoming movie in 2015, Divergent, based on the epic novel series by Veronica Roth. I was impressed with all sorts of things. I give it a 7 out of 10! Remarkable.",Hanna
385,pornomouth,Not a Very Good Thriller,3,6 February 2013,"I went into this movie with high hopes, but unfortunately I was let down. The premise is interesting, with the young girl being raised as a Jason Bourne type super soldier and all, but its just so boring and pretentious.I think the very bland presentation is what did it for me. This could have been a great movie with more heart, or gone the other way and been a great exploitation flick a la Battle Royale. But as it stands, just dullsville. I did not care about Hanna, her father, the dumb family she meets and certainly not Claire Danes doing her best Jodie Foster impersonation.One scene is good however. as other reviewers have pointed out, the scene in the cargo yard is great. Very high suspense, great camera-work, and a great gimmick of the camera always tilting or panning to show you where Hanna is. And yes, in this scene you actually care a bit what happens to her, you root for her to get away from the bad guys...if the rest of the movie had been made with similar gusto, we really would have had something! But as it is, I cannot recommend this movie. A very bland missed opportunity.",Hanna
386,Murcielago_GTS,"It is just an ""ok"" MTV mix of Saoirse Ronan",4,21 April 2011,"Story is quite simple and a little boring. Some critical mistakes, and I hope they were done with a good purpose. When those two little girls are talking in bed, both of them have left arms under their bodies, which could have been OK if their feet were not side by side and faced each other. Maybe I am stupid, but please someone teach me how to do that. Eric wants Hanna to kill whatever that woman is, but he does not show her a picture of how to kill. So Hanna is a perfect soldier that will identify the enemy? Apparently not, and that is why she kills the wrong one at the first place. Hanna is a girl that can fight a way out of a CIA facility, but she still has to run away from two scumbags from which she already kills one. She has been running about 10 minutes and she can still hear the gun shot that kills Eric? She must be a supergirl to do that.",Hanna

388,treeingwalkerjasper,My new favorite movie,10,17 February 2014,"Reasons why Hanna is the best action movie I've ever seen:*An offbeat, emotive, dubstep-like score by The Chemical Brothers*A small, yet diverse and thoughtful pool of characters and personalities*Strong, likable and unique female characters all around*Action scenes with some of the best cinematography you'll ever see. There's even a single-shot subway fight scene.*A unique European setting, which allows for unconventional choices for characters and locations (example: a gang of skinheads as the villain's henchmen)*A same-sex kiss scene, if you like diversity in your films (and you totally should)*Contrasting dreamy fantasy motifs with some brutal and startlingly realistic violence, it manages to be both a modern action thriller and a romantic fairy tale.You might be a little disappointed by the ending, depending on how much you like those kinds of resolutions. If you like loud, talkative films with lots of dialogue and multi-layered plot lines, you'll probably find this movie lacking. I'd recommend it to people who like quiet, contemplative, artsy films, or who can't get enough of badass girl protagonists.",Hanna
389,stermecki_s,Disappointing !,5,29 June 2011,"I am going to be brief. I had high expectations since I felt the cast was good, and the plot seemed quite interesting. It turned out the exact opposite - the plot is full of holes, some of the stories have no ending, some are just there without any significance to the story. Just one example: how was it possible for the operatives to do what they did to Mr.Grimm if they were in such of a rush to capture their fugitives, and also, what was the point of doing that...it just doesn't make any sense. Maybe another one: why does the best CIA operatives, when needing help to find/kill somebody, turn to a small chubby poorly dressed homosexual? Is that to make the story more amusing? And also...being raised in a place without electric, without music...no one learns to use the computer, not to mention the internet in 5 seconds...it's just not possible. These holes are spread all over the movie. Music was exceptional though, that needs to be said, it fits well and generally improves the scenes. I recommend this movie for a Sunday afternoon after being hung-over, and not think about the content a lot.",Hanna
390,gino744,"Aims for the heart, not just the gut.",9,15 April 2011,"I try to avoid watching trailers in their entirety whenever possible. One reason for this is that many of them reveal far too many plot points. Another is that oftentimes they're misleading about the movie's content. A good friend of mine saw 'Hanna' before me and told me not to bother, that all the best scenes were in the trailer. I watched the first fifteen seconds of the trailer before turning it off. I figured that a film starring Cate Blanchett and Eric Bana about a sixteen year old girl with the trained qualities of an assassin couldn't be another dumb shoot-em-up. I figured right.If 'Hanna' has to be categorized into one specific genre, then I suppose it would have to be ""Thriller"". However, this film is also smart, moving, and visually captivating. The screenwriter, director and cinematographer all deserve high praise, as do the actors. There are several memorable performances but the real gem in this film is Saoirse Ronan as Hanna. She appears to be headed for stardom. Without giving away anything in the plot, my favorite scene is in the tent when the previously isolated Hanna connects with her first friend. Powerful yet simple.",Hanna
391,srehmaan21,Will it be too much to ask to ban this ridiculous movie?,1,29 August 2020,I have no idea how this movie got the 6+ rating. It's by far the worst movie I have ever seen. Had no content whatsoever.,Hanna

393,jhgfilms,An exhilarating but bumpy ride,7,10 February 2015,"The film opens with some weird shots, and some odd dialogue with mysterious motives. The film prefers to tell you the story through more visuals than dialogue, which can leave out many aspects of the plot. The story has some bumps, and some weird ideas that remain unclear even after the film ends. It took me three times to fully understand the plot. On the other hand, the camera-work was very remarkable. The continuous shots, the use of hand-held, is very intriguing. This dark fairytale is told from the eyes of Hanna, a young trained assassin, and she is just as confused as the audience. The music by the chemical brothers contain some epic songs like in the container park scene which compliment the film very nicely. Overall, it is a small gem in the film world.",Hanna
394,dirtysassyliquor,A sensory delight,9,25 March 2016,"Having watched Hanna for the second time, I thought I'd visit IMDb for a little more info on cast members etc. Whilst here I was amazed at the large number of extremely negative reviews that have been posted. One reviewer even stated that this film was so bad that he felt compelled to set up an IMDb account to warn people how truly abysmal a film this is.As a result of the above statement, I felt compelled to create an IMDb account to warn people against paying any attention to such dreadfully negative reviews. Don't even read them, in fact don't read any review which may include spoilers that could hinder your potential to enjoy this film.There are many reasons people enjoy film. On any given day you might fancy a comedy, thriller, horror, fantasy, adventure or even something sorrowful. Film allows your mind to run free and without boundary, to experience sights, sounds and emotions that you otherwise might not encounter at that point in time. The rub is that you can only enjoy the true potential that film has to offer if you are capable of allowing your mind to run free and unfettered.There is an awful lot to enjoy about this film, it truly is a sensory delight, so long as you can allow yourself to just sit back and enjoy. If you can't do that, are unable to allow yourself just ninety minutes for a flight of fantasy then honestly, don't bother. Just sit in front of the TV and watch the news or some current affairs program.Film doesn't have to be true to life, it just has to whisk you away somewhere different for a little while. Hanna does just this and it does it very well indeed.",Hanna
395,saund83,A Big Disappointment - Boring and waste of time,1,1 August 2011,I was looking forward to this title and was expecting much action. After 40 minutes I was looking at my watch thinking what the !hell! am I watching. Some parts of the movie are filled with scenes that have nothing to do with the Plot. Like the long lasting scene in Morocco having a guy playing his guitar and a woman doing a Spanish-style dance. Another scene that personally was annoying to me was Hanna's romance with a boy (Suddenly she forgot about all the chasing and the reason of her mission and decided to discover flirting). Another thing that was previously mentioned was the movies obsession about electric toothbrush. I counted 4 scenes just showing toothbrushes and similar dental tools.. I definitely do not suggest this movie to any action Lover.I couldn't wait for it to finishBeware of disappointment and boredness.,Hanna
396,waggerdagger,Stereotypical crap,3,6 July 2011,"As usual, the score on IMDb is way too high. Actually, its ridiculous how this movie can score over 7.All of the characters in this movie are stereotypical, predictable and something we all have seen a 1000 times before. The events that take place feels completely random and it seems to me like they just wanted to make a long music video with short shaky shots because they had a thin (if at all existent) story to begin with.Take the example of Hanna, the 16-year old super-kid, who flees some form of super-bunker in the middle of the Maroccoan desert - just shaky shots with blinking lights of a very imaginative building (the secret bunker), that she manages to escape from by crawling through some form av ventilation shafts a lá a cartoon.There are many of these flaws in logic throughout of what I saw. And I admit. I didn't finish the movie. After about 30 minutes I gave up - I've seen enough of the junk.But the most annoying thing is probably the flat, lame and completely uninteresting characters. Actually, its worth the 1h45m just to have a good laugh and a reference for ""very bad"".",Hanna
397,wxwax,Familiar tropes dressed in high style.,8,11 April 2011,"In life it's the journey, not the destination. In Hanna it's the story-telling, not the story. The story is a weird mash-up of movie clichés, paranoid Bourne Identity meeting coming-of-age Sixteen Candles.What makes Hannah so enjoyable is the craftsmanship of the story-telling. It's the acting by the stunning but asexual Saoirse Ronan and the not-quite-soulless Cate Blanchett. It's the visually sophisticated photography, which is serially beautiful. It's the music and the direction and the pace, which never flags but never rushes.The story is of a 16 year-old girl who's trained to be a killing machine by her guardian (Eric Bana), an on-the-run CIA operative. You could drop Matt Damon in her role and you'd have Bourne. But layered into Hanna's strange trip is her discovery of what her life has been missing: family and relationships.Director Joe Wright has taken his assemblage of clichés and orchestrated them into both an effective action thriller and an occasionally touching coming of age story. It's a fun ride.",Hanna
398,barraob1,"Cliché ridden nonsense, a masterful con job.",1,24 March 2014,"Words fail to describe how bad this movie is, Hanna (Saoirse Ronan) is a master assassin who has been trained by Erik ( Bana) to kill Cate blanchette for killing her mom. The movie jumps around the globe with Hanna killing her way to her target, there isn't any real cohesion and so much filler in between the odd fight, it makes you wish that there was a super human director improvement program so hopefully stuff like this doesn't get made again. How anyone can rate this above 4 is strange indictment of how loose their connection to reality is, I'm quite angry that someone got 30 mill to make this, that's a lot of fine steak, wine, many other things but please not this anything but this.",Hanna
399,ronbarak,Masterpiece a la Steven Seagal,3,7 June 2011,"This movie is a masterpiece in the same sense that Steven Seagal's movies are.I couldn't help thinking throughout the movie that Saoirse Ronan would probably grow up to occupy the same slot that Seagal's occupied, albeit in the opposite gender.The storyline is simplicity itself, in the worst tradition of American cinema, namely, one could guess accurately within the first ten minutes how the plot will unfold and what the climax would be.If you enjoy pure action without any cerebral activity, and almost no humour to talk about, you may enjoy this movie; otherwise, spend the one and three quarters of your life on something better.",Hanna
400,awaite-2,"OK, but not great.",6,4 April 2011,"Honestly I didn't know what to expect going into this film when I was granted a sneak peek tonight. Can anyone tell me if this film is based on a graphic novel of some sort because this is the feel that I felt it had the whole duration. I'm sure after viewing this film, many people will draw a very easy comparison between Hanna and La Femme Nikita (which in my opinion is a much better film as a whole).If you go to see this thinking that it is full of action, you will be disappointed. While there is enough action to keep you interested, most of the film is based solely on character development in relation to the title character with little regard for developing the back stories of any of (what should seem important), supporting characters. I'm not suggesting that in-depth character development is bad, in fact I feel quite contrary , however when the the entire fate of a film rests in the hands of a singular character, I find these films usually fail and unfortunately I would suggest Hanna shares that fate.On a positive note, when the supporting cast of Banna and Blanchett are allowed to shine they do so nicely enough. Also kudos to the cinematographic team for some nice scenery shots.",Hanna

I hadn't seen a trailer and was expecting something along the lines of Mission Impossible. Was I wrong.I'm not great at doing reviews, but I feel I need to say something about this amazing movie! During it, I was very aware at how engrossed I was, hanging on every scene. It was visually stunning - some of the scenes or transitions between them were so beautiful. The title ""HANNA"" on the screen reminded me a lot of Kill Bill. In fact, I felt Saoirse Ronan's Hanna is a teenage version of The Bride from Kill Bill and Leeloo from The Fifth Element.I've seen Cate Blanchett in a couple of movies, but was impressed by her portrayal of a ruthless agent. I hate to say that Eric Bana's character (Erik) was ""almost"" forgettable - in the end, the movie was really not about him. But he did show up once wet and without much clothing and that was just fine by me.I am not a fan of violence (and Tarantino's bugs me a lot), but I was OK with the quantity and visibility of it in this movie. Fans of Kill Bill should enjoy Hanna.",Hanna

Nothing is explained well in it. So many bizarre scenes that make absolutely no sense. Any good review of this movie just rambles on about the 'wonderful scenery' and cinematography when the movie itself is just plain rubbish!! If anyone gives this a good rating please explain why you think it is good in terms of the story itself and not for the camera work or scenery because I was bored out of my mind halfway through it and in the end was so disappointed. It started off with potential but went really downhill and left so much unexplained with loads of holes in the parts it did explain!

(review contains spoilers, honestly though it would be hard to spoil this crapfest).",1,17 June 2011,"OK, so you've got 16 year old girl who is a genetically altered super soldier. She has spent her entire life training in combat, stealth, etc., basically she is a bad-ass (which she proves right off the bat when she kills like half a dozen soldiers and escapes from a highly secure government facility). So why does she spend a large part of the movie running from two skin-heads and a 5 foot tall psychopath in a tennis outfit? It makes no sense she could have easily killed them all. Which she proves when they catch up to her and she quickly kills one of the skin-heads without even breaking a sweat, then she runs away from the other (unarmed) skin-head and the psycho in the tennis shorts. She could have just killed all three right then and been done with it. As if that wasn't bad enough later in the movie Hannah and her father are together. Her father being the man who trained her (and the man who earlier in the filmed killed like five armed men with his bare hands). The (still unarmed) skin-head and the (also unarmed) psychopath show up along with the very woman who it is Hannah's mission in life to kill. So, do the two of them quickly and easily dispatch their foes and then go out for ice cream? No, they split up and run. Yes they both run from people that either one of them could have easily killed on their own much less together. The whole thing was just ridiculous. Throw in a bunch ""artistic imagery"" and a whole bunch of useless subtext and you have 111 minutes of your life you will never get back. Take my word for it, skip this one.",Hanna
405,lovesthrillers,Promising Premise Ruined by Ending,4,29 July 2012,"I'd been looking forward to renting this movie for months. It's on several best thriller (of 2011) lists, and the premise is interesting and fresh. What Works: 1) Great acting. 2) Magnificent scenery. 3) Intriguing heroes in the young girl and father. In fact, all the characters except the villain are really interesting and fresh. 4) Premise with a ton of potential.What Doesn't Work (UG): 1) Endings give stories meaning, significance, resonance, resolution, and a feeling that the journey was important and meant something. This ending made everything seem pointless. In fact, it reminded me of Duel (1971), the movie about the evil, nameless, murderous truck/driver, who died in the end, and we never knew what any of it was about. (Yes, I know Duel starred Dennis Weaver, who I adore, and was directed by Steven Spielberg, who I also adore. Saw that movie in the 70's and am still wishing I could unsee it.)2) Logic errors. It doesn't hold up. Because it doesn't have a resolution that explains things and gives them meaning, and because we learn only a little during the movie, the interesting (and mysterious) aspects ended up seeming totally illogical. 3) Villain... she's bad. Anything else? No, she's just bad. Why? 'Cause she's bad. Why does she want what she wants? All that badness inside, one presumes. What would've fixed this villain? A great ending that gave us insight into her actions. Oh, I know. How about a thriller-type ending, where the reveal offers a cool twist?No more wimpy, ""never mind"" endings, people. I just can't take it. Please....",Hanna
406,londonrod,Disappointing,6,4 November 2011,"I rented this movie the other day, after months of keen anticipation since initially seeing the trailers prior to its theatrical release. It looked to be a very promising movie. In the end, however, it was a letdown.As many others have already mentioned here, a major flaw with the movie are the numerous plot holes and scenes that require more than the typical willing suspension of disbelief for a movie in this genre. Too many things just don't make sense, and whatever story arc that may have been attempted by the writers/director/producers, is, in the end, left flat.The actions sequences are interspersed with scenes of emotional reflection that have a true poetic feel to them, but rather than enhance the overall plot, they seem more like interruptions in what could have otherwise been an engaging story.In the end, I give the movie a 6/10, as its overall production value is somewhat above average, but it is still seriously flawed for the reasons mentioned above.",Hanna
407,elpap77,A Unique Vision,9,31 August 2014,"Hanna has to be one of the coldest action flicks to grace the American silver screen in years. Those hoping for a Hollywood blockbuster designed to bombard the senses with pointless stimuli should avoid this movie. Additionally, those that require crude happy endings and naively cheerful plot developments which run counter to the 'natural' development of a story beware; this film is not meant for you. However, if you find yourself drawn to films which challenge the traditional interpretation of what it means to be a 'good film', movies which exude a sense of radical independence and present themselves as unique visions, then Hanna should be a perfect fit.It resembles a full-blooded, that is, non-superficial, foreign film. Saoirse Ronan is simply fantastic. Hanna's character is remarkably genuine to her unnatural upbringing. They didn't circumvent the reality of the situation by allowing her to become some ""hero"" that goes outside of herself solely as to foster heartfelt feelings in the audience. At the same time, they managed to avoid the common mistake of pigeonholing the protagonist into a vacuous one-dimensionality that defines so many characters in modern films. Hanna is portrayed as a real human being, with moments of brilliance and instances of weakness. The real ""perfect assassin"" would be anything but human.There is at least one criticism which I would wage against it, albeit a minor one. At certain points in the film, the cinematography goes a little overboard. Techniques meant to convey a sense of chaos and desperateness, such as whirling rotations and disheveled, disjunct camera movements are abused to excess, and as such, end up detracting from the continuity of the plot and actually hinder the expression of the emotion attempting to be emphasized.",Hanna
408,jbaronde-660-839046,"Better than expected, Suckerpunch with way better story",8,15 April 2011,"This reminded me of Rollerbabies, which is a complement. I remember that as being a great movie in the 80s when I was a kid. Hanna is not of the same plot, but a young kid doing things beyond her maturity level out of necessity or because that's all she knows.Plot does leave some holes, or at least, you might need to watch it twice to really get where everyone comes from. But that doesn't take away from the good movie. Good soundtrack with the action parts, it really gets you into it.Great action, and it isn't pretty for a PG-13. It's pretty raw and feels real. Hanna is ultimately ruthless. Just saw Suckerpunch before this and compare it because it is also ""young"" women (not teens) doing action. Except that movie was all BS action based on the same thing as my daydreams. Hanna's action is really happening (in movie terms). I was worried I'd get a lame, ultra-kid friendly, coming-of-age movie. But what I got was an intense, entertaining, non-Disney coming-of-age movie.",Hanna

Seriously, stop reading, don't watch the film and go calculate Pi or something.""This, after my opinion is an absolutely ridiculous statement. Comparing this to Inception, or the Matrix, is imho very far off. There isn't much to understand or not understand. It's laid out there all in the open - sorry if you don't think so (but in comparison to Inception, this is quite an easy ""brain teaser""). Watching this movie, a movie I've been wanting to see since its release, I felt disappointed. Why? I'll tell you what I personally didn't like (and what I did like). Even if the movie has some great actors and actresses included, e.g. Saoirse Ronan acts out her character Hanna really well. The action scenes aren't bad, not at all. It goes a bit up and down, from great mixtures of ""gameplay""-like kill streaks to sloppy moves and mistakes(not in an acting way) that the agents/characters wouldn't have done considering who they ""are"" (makes me go, D'oh). But it's nothing major. The movie has a beautiful visual and doesn't disappoint at all on these points. No, the reason why I voted a six is because this felt unfinished. I felt like I was eating a fairly good dinner that got ripped away from me before I got to finish the plate. In lack of other words; I wish this movie gave me, as a watcher, ""closure"". I wanted more, I wanted answers and I just really didn't feel like it ended well - in the sense that I thought ""... this really can't be it"". This is a movie with great potential, which I think didn't get reached. Much more could've been done. I'd give this a 4 out of 6, and I'm not giving it less than a 6 because the movie is all in all well done just a bit lacking and too inconvenient story-wise. And please, I did get the story, that's why I can see a lot missing from the plot (and yes, I get that this way it ""visualize"" how Hanna sees the world, but it just doesn't cut it for me). No, without spoiling anything I think this movie was a ""plot with good potential turned into a very simple movie. It's nowhere near a difficult-to-understand movie.",Hanna

They need to hire Frank Miller to turn it into a graphic novel and, then perhaps it would reach some of it's potential. As it was, the action sequences are silly like old Bond movies, but sadly they aren't meant to be. (Gotta love it when people who are running like they stole it are caught by the leisurely jogger in pursuit.) Aside from that, character development and motivation are practically non-existent, and in the end the very premise is absurd in all aspects. Ugh. Absolutely pathetic.

She says ""I just missed your heart."" *Shoots deer/Marissa in the head*.Also, Cate Blanchett was fantastic as Marissa. But, she does go on and off with a southern accent.Eric Bana's performance was phenomenal. You are drawn in by his solid performance which makes you think you are in the movie.Saoirse Ronan is by far the best actress in the movie.

413,Steve7216,Saoirse Ronan's film,7,16 April 2011,"Instead of writing a moderate to lengthy review of ""Hanna"", I wish to recommend the film especially to those of you who may not be familiar with Saoirse Ronan. As one who enjoys and seeks out good films, I can tell you that overall Hanna does include some arresting and beautiful cinematography in addition to a quirky art-house style. The film is entertaining and fun even though the plotting is thin and the secondary characters are not written with a lot of depth. That being said, those characters are portrayed by very fine actors including the distinguished Cate Blanchett.The main reason to see this film however, is to experience the lead character played by Saoirse Ronan. While this role was not written to contain the emotional depth charges of the Susie Salmon character in ""The Lovely Bones"", it does allow her the opportunity to completely sell us on the idea of this feral- like young woman who will kill easily and efficiently, and she also engages our empathy as a human being shocked into entering a baffling and disorienting modern world without any socialization skills because from the age of two, she has only interacted with one person.She once again displays the ability to completely rivet the viewer's attention with a very powerful screen presence and charisma. Although it has been stated many times, it is true that you cannot take your eyes off her when she is on the screen. And of course, her acting is thoroughly natural and capable of fulfilling any requirement of her role. Considering her age (now 17), she is truly a unique and remarkable acting talent. So don't hesitate to spend a couple of hours to watch the most exciting rising star in film.",Hanna

At it's core, there's a very complex character that's both interesting and sympathetic. Unfortunately, seeing how small the number of people in the theater was on the night I saw this, it seems that a lot of people will miss out on this awesome, awesome movie. Hopefully the reviews here can help you change peoples' mind.The story begins by showing Hanna, a physically sharp teenage girl with a mysterious past, hunting a deer. Her father eventually explains that a government agent named Marissa Weigler is searching for her. He's been training her for her entire life so that she can take on Weigler. If she flicks a switch, Marissa Weigler will know where they are, and an intensely rehearsed plan to kill her and live life without any potential harm will begin. Unfortunately, not everything goes as planned, and as Hanna tries to reach her father after she's escaped capture, the hunt begins.First of all, let's discuss the technical aspects of this movie. After seeing three of Joe Wright's movies, it's clear that this man has an enormous hard-on for cinematography, and I thank him for it. There are so many beautiful shots and flashy camera-techniques in this movie. All of them fit the specific moments in which they exist, but they all blend together very well. The best looking scenes are the scenes in the snow-laden forest. Of course, the cinematography would fall apart without proper editing, and holy cow do they nail it. I don't know who edited this film, but he did a FANTASTIC job. In all honesty, this deserves an Oscar nod for editing. The movie is filled with quick cuts, and they make the action scenes much more shocking than they would otherwise be. There's a scene early in the film where Hanna kills a group of guards (won't spoil why or where) and shoots all of the cameras in the room, and the way it's edited makes you jump with every gun shot.The acting here is is superb. Saoirse Ronan gives an incredibly dynamic performance as always. She's a great young talent that has shown us several times now that she's a force to be reckoned with. Kate Blanchett gives a great performance as well. She gives a performance that is both cold and emotional when necessary. Eric Bana gives a surprisingly good performance as Eric, Hanna's father. It's not a huge stretch for him, but he certainly does a good job. The actors playing some of the lesser side-characters also do a great job, although the actress playing Hanna's new friend Sophie got on my nerves at times. Sophie's mother, however, is played by the lovely Olivia Williams, probably best known to you from Roman Polanski's Ghost Writer. Jason Flemming makes an excellent supporting villain. He has both charm and a wickedness that makes you want to smash him across the face with a crowbar.I was looking forward to this movie quite a bit, so to prepare, I boycotted reviews for about a week. After I saw the film and liked it so much, I HAD to see if critics agreed. I was disappointed to see that that didn't.A lot of people seem to think that this has a ridiculous plot and a hollow story. I'm not usually the kind to say this, but screw the critics; they're idiots. Don't be fooled by their opinions. I hate to be the one to say that some people didn't understand this movie because I think that that's a bit holier-than-thou. However, I have to say it here: this movie went over their heads. If you pay attention to the relationship between all of the characters, you'll understand why this plot unfolded the way it did and the motivations behind the characters. In fact, the film works even better because of that. This movie is a bit like a trail of dominos that form a picture when they've all fallen; you won't understand the point of it all until every last domino has fallen.What can I say? This movie was phenomenal. I went in with enormous expectations and was completely blown away. This movie has so many elements sewn into it that fondly remind me of my favorite films. It has everything I want in a movie and more. It finds the perfect balance of honest emotion and thrilling action. The result is a knock-out. This movie may very well end up on my Best of the Year list. Honestly, I haven't enjoyed seeing a movie in the theater this much since I saw Inception for the first time.",Hanna
415,tom-daly80,absolutely NO plot this movie sucks,3,10 April 2011,"This movie is not worth the money at all and i'm 100% sure that the reason so many people gave this a high rating is because they are in with whoever created this god awful film. Seriously totally useless movie. There is one slightly redeeming factor and that is that some of the songs are pretty catchy. However, the chemical brothers really didn't give this movie enough tracks. The only reason this movie gets a 3 is that there were a couple of OK action sequences, the music was good, and there was one maybe two good lines. I hope you guys don't waste your time or money on this movie but if you do just remember i told you.",Hanna
416,petra-gao,Stupid and Ridiculous,2,24 September 2011,"This is the first time that I review a film. It is so stupid and ridiculous that I cannot even help writing something negative about it.The whole story is without any logic. It is about Hanna and her papa who are trying to escape from some people who are not even aware of their existence in the first place. Somehow, they made the decision to send out some radio signal to let those bad guys know their existence, so that they can run away from them.It is funny to see how obsessed those guys are with martial arts. Obviously they do not like using guns.It has been a waste of time to watch this film.",Hanna
417,jeff71345,Looking for Jason Bourne. Got Jason Boring.,1,10 April 2011,"This movie had me on the edge of my seat, wanting to leave. I came looking for a suspense filled action movie. I got a little girl making her first friend. I unfortunately realized it was not going to get better too late to switch theaters. The plot was simple and worked well. A little girl is genetically altered to be a super soldier for the CIA. An agent with a heart of gold helps her Mom to escape with her. The Mom is killed during the escape and the agent raises the girl as his own. He trains her to get revenge on the woman who killed her Mom. Sounds good right? Lots of fights. The girl uncovers the truth of her genetic origins then gets the vengeance due her. No. That is too satisfying. She has to make a friend and learn how to live in a modern age. Her Dad trains her to kill but she is surprised by a light switch? How can you send your daughter to kill in Morocco then meet you in Germany but never prepare her for the 21st century. Somewhere Sarah Conner is weeping.",Hanna
418,d_corrina,Was okay but the ending was 'meh',7,19 April 2011,"The movie wasn't too bad. I found it to be interesting through-out most of the movie but the ending left something to be desired. :-/ I liked that there was plenty of action and it had quite the out-of-the-ordinary story-line and yet not that much gore (I'm not big on the blood & gut part of many action movies). I feel they could have done a lot more with the ending and because they seemed to slack off in that area it kind of made the movie not as good as it was before the ending happened. There were a few parts that seemed more like space-fillers than important to the movie but it is just how I perceived it whereas others may feel it helps with the feel of the movie. And, last but not least, the actress that played the main character did a great job through-out the movie and it was a good match. :)",Hanna
419,PennTraffic,Why all the hype?,1,21 April 2011,"This was definitely one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I can't understand how people can write praising reviews at the same time they say that the characters weren't developed, the plot had many unclear points (like most of it). In fact I came onto the IMDb website to see if I could find out why these people were doing what they were doing, which was mostly beating each other up and killing gruesomely.(I'm sorry I had to mark this as a spoiler as people will waste money on it as I did, if they don't read my review. But this is my first IMDb review and I'm not sure if this review is a spoiler or not, but I didn't want to take any chances and get blacklisted.)",Hanna

I don't know how it is sitting at 7.5 I will give it a 5 for the background score when eric bana was running. I did n't find anything interesting than that particular background score.Completely stupid movie. For a girl who is so excited to see a electric bulb..... Can enter a netcafe and browse internet immediately.moving from city to city finding addresses without ever being in a city/even among people.Never wrote a review before......just got annoyed at the rating at IMDb after watching the movie/////// so just want to warn others......CHEERS......,Hanna
421,rorystephens555,A decent film to watch,10,26 February 2012,"I found this film to be pretty entertaining overall. Saoirse Ronan plays her part exceptionally well. The film carries suspense, action and poignant glimpses at a young girl who didn't know she was different to others until she left home.There are also a few good laughs in the film as well. Although it can be argued that the Bourne-esque film genre is a bit of a tired pony at this stage, Hanna gives us a fresh take on it. The action holds more gravity than the usual action flicks you see normally and the script is pretty well developed (I noticed that one of the commentators who gave this film 1 star stated he didn't know why Cate Blanchet was chasing her, it's explained in the film)The settings are probably one of the best features of the film. They stray away from the usual Bank jobs or street shootouts and come up with new and inventive places to stage the scenes.I had fun watching it anyways.",Hanna
422,susandenim,Best review,7,7 May 2011,"We do like a good action film when it is done well and this one certainly put's in the work. If you think 'young female protagonists' this film season then where 'True Grit' takes our investment in the obvious vulnerability of a young girl and offsets it with a no nonsense back bone, 'Hanna' takes both those polarities to the far extreme. A pretty, blue eyed, petite young girl let out in a big cruel world that is out to get her, Hanna cuts a somewhat meek figure that transforms into an entity who is far more comfortable unleashing her particular brand of spectacular violence on the CIA operatives that hunt her than she is at finding that space in the world that a young teenage girl might inhabit after growing up in total isolation.The performances are all solid, Eric Bana is believable as her German father and as an action man, the casting of Cate Blanchett as the main antagonist gives the film an added depth not just for her performance but for the strikingly similar features she shares with Hanna. It is beautifully shot, the cinematography takes excellent advantage of the change of landscapes but without ever detracting from the action. I may be wrong but I think it's a Hollywood made film moonlighting as a European one, it does this effortlessly and it gives the viewer some breathing space away from the typical Hollywood action set up. It was a great touch getting the Chemical Brothers to do the soundtrack, it elevated that European atmosphere and the feel the music had for the environment was intuitive and at times even played a strong supporting role.Definitely a film I would recommend, it's got something for young girls as much as it does for older action loving guys but is executed with enough class to always stay a step behind being tongue in cheek . If you don't rush out to go and see it, it is a movie you will see at sometime or another because it's got enough of it's own flavor to stick around for a while.",Hanna
423,roger-that-101,One of the worst films I have ever seen!,1,25 May 2011,"CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!! I've opened an account on IMDb to warn you against this Film! It is a complete and utter waste of time. I don't know how it is scoring so highly on IMDb. The plot is ridiculous - we're not told why this girl poses a threat, what her Father did wrong, it doesn't explain why they had to split up only to meet at the same point again (couldn't they have got the bus together? LOL). The whole 'super human' business just doesn't wash, how can a skilled 'fighter' take out a soldier in one fell swoop and then struggle to fight against two skinheads? It doesn't make sense. Why on earth would the typical bad guy whistle a stupid tune when he is trying to find the girl? Hello..... whistling will give your location away! Why would you, if you are being followed (and you are a trained spy) make your way to an isolated underground car park type place? Why if you are trying to catch said spy, and there are 4 of you would you get involved in a hand to hand fight (which was poor by the way) - just shoot the guy, taser him, whatever - in the real world you would keep you distance! And then when the spy (the father) beats up the 4 agents he doesn't take the radio with him, he doesn't search them for weapons, it's just an insult to one's intelligence. There are so many holes in the plot it's almost laughable! None of it makes sense. Why does the grandmother get shot? She's been ignored for the last 16 years! Why would a trained super human spy be amazed/puzzled by a light, a TV, a kettle? And then she asks why she needs a bit of paper (her passport) to say who she is? Please do not waste your time with this film, it is nothing like the Bourne films or Leon (which some people seem to be comparing it with). This film is about a little girl, who's been stuck in the forest with her father for 16 years (and by the way, she doesn't even look 12, let alone 16!), finding her way in the big world beyond the forest. The film makers have tried to put a spin on this age old plot, but it just reduces the film to the pile of garbage that it is.",Hanna
424,snowysix,Not based on a book? I wonder about that . . .,6,12 May 2011,"How can nobody remember a 1981 book by Mildred Ames titled ""Anna to the Infinite Power,"" about a genetically modified girl who is part of a government experiment to produce super-children. She does not know about the others until she meets one. At a certain point, the ""program"" is shut down. But the adventure continues.The book was made into a movie with the same title in 1983.Now we have a movie called ""Hanna"" about a genetically modified child who results from a government experiment to produce super-assassins. The other children are ""disposed of"" (""Do you understand?"") and Hanna presumably should have been, but is saved by her father.What I liked about this movie was the absence of conventionalities like irrelevant sex, heavy drinking, and 15-minute punching matches. The chase scenes could have included more tricks by Hanna, instead of just plain fleeing. But there no shortage of proof that she is a super-fighter. Also, I would have expected cleverer attempts to catch or trap her, since her ""enemies"" knew they were dealing with a super-hero.",Hanna
425,devesh-nsit,Pathetic,3,3 June 2011,"Extremely average movie.The movie fails to hold attention at any point of time. Saoirse Ronan's enactment of protagonist is extremely weak and entirely unconvincing.It is particularly hard to achieve a fine balance when the female protagonist is an action hero - but it has been done pretty convincingly earlier , for e.g in GI Jane. Even powerful actors like Eric Bana and Cate Blanchett seem completely disillusioned and uninvolved.It is just a feeble attempt, and movies of same genre like X-men have already set the bar too high.The movie fails in all departments be it the storyline,effects or action sequences.Specially the action sequences involving Saoirse Ronan are particularly weak. Not recommended at all.",Hanna
426,fzahmad75,i agree with MFFJM2,5,3 June 2011,This is one of the first movies i went to see with my wife on the big screen in a long time thinking it would be awesome! She fell asleep and I forced my self to to stay awake cause cause i actually paid money for this. Wait to download this movie when a good copy comes out on the net!!It started out cool but there were so many scenes that just bored the crap out of me. The trailer is deceiving! It makes you think high octane film. it is not. After all it is a PG13 movie. when little action starts one would expect to see what happens. It doesn't. You see the beginning of a scene when she is about kill someone but it just shows someone dead after she caulks her gun or other device.BORING MOVIE!!!!!,Hanna

428,brianswebb,In desperate need of an editor...and a credible storyline...and a lot more,2,9 June 2011,"This film has some beautiful locations early on, but quickly becomes so pointless and loses credibility very quickly.While there are some great actors and actresses in this film, they unfortunately have very few lines of dialogue, and also have very few opportunities to show us why they act or feel the way they do.The film seems to happen for no reason. Sure, Hanna wants to kill the US secret agent Marissa because she killed her mother, but everything else is left largely unanswered. The super-warrior waif I can go along with for a time, but the film ends up becoming ridiculous when Hanna leaps out of a hole in the ground to grab the underside of a Humvee driving overhead. Idiotic.Then the interaction she has with the English family is a confused mix of light relief and possible self reflection on a life spent in the Arctic wilderness without family fun. We're left wondering what happens to the family after she leaves them and they get found by the baddies.The baddies that Marissa rely on apart from gray faceless operatives are hard to take seriously. Are they meant to be funny? Skinheads in boots led by a fuhrer in tennis shorts is possibly trying too hard, but apart from a tenuous eugenics connection with Hanna's genetic manipulation, I can't really see why the film-makers did this.The inconsistencies in the story are infuriating too. Hanna is freaked out by an old black and white TV in Morocco, but somehow uses the Internet to discover the truth about her father and the DNA manipulation carried out on her.Ultimately the predictable end to the film comes too late and you've had enough.",Hanna

I have set-up an account here just to warn readers that haven't seen this movie to steer away and not to spend any money (watch this only if you get paid to watch ... as seems to be pretty apparent with about 1/3 of reviewers of this god awful tripe of a flick). I think IMDb should run an investigation as to where these upbeat reviewers are coming from, as not only me but a number of folks here suspect that only individuals involved in production of this flick could have given these positive ""outstanding action flick"" reviews. Do yourself a favor and stare at the wall for 1 hour and 45 minutes, you will be bored, but at least won't feel stupid.",Hanna
430,DataByne,Grimm's Bourne,8,9 January 2012,"Hanna is a strangely absorbing title, with a soft, otherworldly spirit, which will be the breaking point for most viewers, who will be expecting a film of non-stop action and thrills. Instead, Hanna is a film of discovery, where beauty is courted and violence is a fact of life, but not its purpose.Hanna is not a spy film. It is not an action film, at least not as defined by the testosterone induced products that we have come to associate with the genre. It is not wholly a thriller, though it bears the most resemblance to these. While there's nothing inherently wrong with those kinds of movies, it seems unfair that Hanna must be held to standards that only confine it and condemn it. Hanna is not a movie about punch-outs and fire-fights, nor is it a film of car chases and bravado. While such defining elements of the action genre can be found herein, its not the point.The point is the girl. Hanna. Played with innocent splendor by Saoirse Ronan. This is her fairytale, but not a Disney one. It a Grimm fairytale (an element that acknowledged with an increasingly heavy hand...) full of beauty and horror. The violence and action only punctuate the sense of self-discovery and marvel that Hanna feels. The Chemical Brothers' haunting and wondrous soundtrack accentuates this feeling at every moment, further engrossing the viewer in Hanna's plight. Hanna has such a yearning for music that the beauty of the melodies that accompany her every step seems a cruel tease, but lends to the fantasy that has been created with such grace as to rival the music of films that aspire to that genre. Not to say that the other elements of the film don't support Ms. Ronan, they do. The direction of the little things is what matters most, Hanna's interactions with characters, having the camera linger on Hanna's face as she explores a new sensation, the set at the climax of the film, a carousel spinning, Tom Hollander's gloriously disturbed Big Bad Wolf, the list goes on.However, my review so far would seem to be at odds with my rating. The story that underlines Hanna's adventure is weak and at times unnecessary. The plot twists in predictable and foreseeable ways. Cate Blanchet's accent is obtrusive, despite an otherwise sound performance. The fairytale thread becomes increasingly heavy handed, when subtlety was need most. These elements hurt a film of vision, but do not doom it in my eyes. Hanna is still a movie worth seeing, especially if you are looking for a change of pace and theme from your thrillers.On A Side Note: Hanna has a female protagonist (surprise), and of any thriller/action film I've ever seen, none have been treated with more respect. Most times when a film attempts this, the director (usually a man) seems to cater to a different kind of fantasy than Hanna presents, and the characters come off as stereotypes and sex idols (there were several released within the same year as Hanna...). Hanna avoids this entirely, and if usually action and thriller films turn you off because they cater to a strictly male demographic, then do give Hanna a chance.",Hanna
431,bascaliotu,Waste of time and money! Really!,1,24 June 2011,"This movie has no plot, no emotions, no thrill....no nothing. It's like a music video but without the music. It started promising but right after the first 15 mins when the guy leaves north pole or whatever that was in a suit and the little girl starts killing agents in a snap it all went from bad to worst and to a nightmare by the end.I get the girl was some type of dna product of the CIA, a program that they suspended and killed everyone involved and it may explain why she has certain abilities but how does one travel from Morocco to Spain and then to Berlin in a matter of days without passport, identity, money or even a clue how a light switch works?There's no explanation to anything. The movie does not provide. It looks like an old European movie with little to no funds. No effects, no guilt, no thinking, no comedy, no drama no no no. You can watch it without sound and even without trying to read their lips, it's so easy.I wonder how Blanchet accepted this role or even Bana. I usually trust the ratings on IMDb and so far they never let me down, up until this movie of course, so it must be some sort of abuse. That's my only logic explanation.",Hanna
432,Ruiinaba,Stylish but note quite,6,25 September 2011,"This movie is quite an ordinary action film, despite its potential to be outstanding. . It just seemed so economically constructed, it failed to appeal to me by actually nothing much being unfolded. The story seems to abruptly end as she quite abruptly becomes aware of who her parents seemed to be, and their story, in true comic fashion. Every scene is rather economically strung together, every line, a rather boring drip feeding of her predictably sombre tune. The abundance of silence is both an attempt to portray stoicism as well as a script that is simply bland. Blanchett portrays what is becoming a typecast; a driven woman whose chilling determination seems to cool the air around her. There is a sharp bitterness she portrays superbly, albeit in hyperbole. Strongly reminds me of a comic book with similar themes from the early naughts. A stylized comic book action number, very streamlined story, rather slender in substance. Feels like an obligatory prequel, tedious in its expository pompousness. The character seems too valuable to shelve without a sequel. Perhaps next time, it might dazzle.",Hanna

434,julie_moseley,Bourne Identity Rip-off,3,2 May 2011,"Meh. I gave it three out of ten stars. It is a Bourne Identity rip-off with considerably less character development. Saoirse Ronan's performance, however, is extraordinary. Otherwise I'd have given it one star.In Bourne Identity, we get a really steamy romance, riddled with tension and conflict over self-preservation versus love. In Hanna, we get a similar best-friend-teen-girl-crush to replace it, but it's not taken far enough to create a pivot point in the plot, or to wrench our hearts.Cate's motivation, as the bad guy, is never clearly established. In fact, the plot would be more believable if she were the good guy! Saorise's character is powerful, believable, and endearing - in a fierce, feminist kind of way. Terry Gilliam should pick up this character and run with it! If you're debating whether to go to the theater or stream Netflix, may I suggest that you stay home and watch Tideland.If you just need to get out with the spouse and kids, go ahead and see it.",Hanna

Parts are played very well, liked Cate Blanchett a lot and Saoirse Ronan does it right too. Photography is beautiful. Plot twists are not so easy to guess as usually happens in action movies. The rhythm is a little irregular, action scenes are good, and some introspective ones are good too, however a few of this scenes are not according to the tone of the whole movie and think the director could made it better. Overall is just a easy to see smart action movie with an original history.",Hanna
436,skiingman_for_life,Utter drivel and a complete waste of time!,1,18 September 2011,"I really wanted to like this movie. Honestly, I did. The trailer looked very enticing and was well edited which got me sucked into seeing the movie in the theater. Once the movie started to roll, I knew I had been suckered.First, the good (which is a VERY short list) -- Eric Bana did an excellent job and was the most convincing character in the film. OK, that's about it for the good.Now, for the bad. Quality actors like Cate Blanchett and Tom Hollander (who was EXCELLENT in ""Land of the Blind"") came across as flat and boring and did nothing to lend credibility to the script (which needed a lot of help to begin with). Cate's phony off/on Southern accent was horribly delivered; she has far more colloquial talent than that. Maybe she realized that the movie was so bad that she simply didn't want to bother.The gratuitousness of the scenes, such as Hollander's ""male and female genitalia"" nonsense, seemed purposefully thrown in just to create some kind of stir. Ditto for the lesbian leanings between the girls and the sex noises coming from the parents campers. This was not some sexual coming-of-age movie and scenes like those seemed cringingly out of place.Worst of all were the anachronisms and lack of credibility in the scenes themselves. The magic camper van seemed to travel an amazing amount of distance (Morocco to Central Europe) in no time flat. When Hanna learns that she is in Morocco, she speaks in perfect Arabic (from her training and genetic engineering) but fails to recognize Morocco from the map in front of her. Huh? Also, there is NO WAY anyone can grab the underside of trucks moving at high speed without snatching tendons and ligaments apart, genetic mutations or not. Hanna is more indestructible than Spiderman. Maybe if this was a Marvel Comics movie instead, I might buy some of these scenes. The end scene when Hanna kills Marissa (Blanchett) lacks any shred of believability. So, this perfect little assassin is going to stand on the railroad tracks and then turn her back to let Marissa get a shot off first before she kills her with the arrow? This girl single-handedly kills off dozens of CIA agents and assorted bad guys but makes this stupid mistake in the end? Ugh...PAINFULLY BAD! I could go on and on, but hopefully you get the idea. Save your time and money for something else and don't waste it on ""Hanna"".",Hanna

If Tom Waits were to write an action movie about assassins - well... it wouldn't be anything like this probably but i think that's what they were going for.

Seen that been there. blah blah blah.' while sipping cooking sherry and contemplating how brilliant Luis Bunuel was. But for the guy who likes movies - likes semi cerebral action movies with a little something more than just long legged bimbos and things blowing up the way roses smell on a great spring day - this is probably more your cup of action juice. Is it wildly implausible? Yes. Is it the type of thing that you don't mind the wild implausibility? Yep. A little Run Lola Run injected with a little Bourne identity, mixed with a hefty dollop of macabre carnival butter makes this a seriously enjoyable, beautiful, terrific mess of a film that will make you cheer.",Hanna

Saoirse Ronan is one of the most versatile actresses, especially for a 17 year old. The plot was very confusing & this is the movie for you if you're into the whole 'puzzling' feel in a movie. There was a couple of parts that didn't really make sense as mentioned in other reviews the 'switch'..I really didn't think it was necessary. But otherwise it was quite an interesting movie, but it isn't for everyone. I watched this movie with my step-dad & he didn't like it at all. But I thought the whole 'super-soldier' idea was interesting..it had me on the edge of my seat!

Also, some badly shot action is present.There is a similar movie to this, called Colombiana, this is the way it should have been done.For all the action lovers out there, I do not recommend you to watch this.Regs M",Hanna
441,alexwatkins7,Much more than 'just another revenge movie',7,4 December 2014,"Aspects of Hanna's narrative have been seen in many other films leaving it's level of originality quite low. That being said, I think this film's cinematographic style and the sparse comedy/weirdness saved it from becoming 'just another revenge movie' and becoming something much, much more.The acting level of this film is high; in particular, the main character Saoirse Ronan, who I was not previously aware of, really held her own against the bigger names in the film contributing an awesome performance. The film features a few annoying stereotypes that aren't so bad as to put you off but are definitely noticeable and unnecessary. The narrative can also feel a little spoon fed at time's especially when conveying the specifics of characters personalities. Sometimes it's nice to have to figure stuff out without help!The cinematography in this film is one of it's greatest achievements and enhances the narrative so well; it is subtle and doesn't jump out as pushing and boundaries but that might just be why it works so well. Another enhancing element that worked very well is the soundtrack; written and performed by the chemical brothers, it helps accentuate the tension when necessary and inject a pace into the film that can really excite the audience. As much as I hate their music normally, there is definitely something to be said for those crazy techno guys.Although quite sparse throughout the film, the action scenes were really well choreographed, nothing on any of the classic kung-fu films but definitely realistic enough. That combined with the fact Saoirse Ronan did all her own stunts makes it a winner in my book.The VFX for this film are credited to Mr.X who, I think we can all agree, did a fantastic job. I for one didn't notice anything that I thought was VFX in the whole movie, and that's saying a lot! Their set extensions, location replacement composites and roto/cleanup work really propelled the films look above its £30 million budget and gave it a thoroughly world spanning feel. Truly superb seamless VFX work!Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this movie for many different reasons and although it probably wouldn't feature in my top 100 films it definitely deserves a recommendation.",Hanna
442,mark-carolan,Lazy screenplay and direction,2,18 December 2011,"It's a oft-done story: the ""special"" person being hunted, but this implementation is lazy and self-conscious; trying to be hip and edgy but looking amateurish. Gaps, inconsistencies and contradictions everywhere. I've never done a film review before but I was so annoyed, having paid for this on cable, I felt compelled. Apart from the story, which was illogical and trite, Cate Blanchett, who played a central character, was more wooden than a dugout canoe. And what the hell was that accent supposed to be? The music didn't work at all, but maybe there was a point: to take your mind off the plot, which made even the most strenuous attempts at ""suspension of disbelief"" impossible.Editing was competent, but really they didn't have much to work with.",Hanna
443,daniel-breslauer,Excellent movie,10,21 December 2011,"This movie is just amazing. I'm not that good at writing reviews, so I'll keep it simple: 1) The acting is amazing. If you ask me, not only the main actors but the supporting ones as well, all deserve awards for their performances. 2) The filming is amazing, on all locations. 3) The soundtrack is amazing. 4) Involving classic stories such as the Grimm fairy tales is a major plus in any movie.As others have said, it's not one type of movie. I wouldn't call it action, thriller, Sci-Fi, drama - it's a combination of all of these, with some comedy thrown in as well. It's one of the best ""good against evil"" movies I've ever seen. The plot is difficult to understand at first but becomes clear as the movie progresses.",Hanna
444,oldmcjono,"Good Gtory, Terrible Execution",1,2 January 2012,"*Before I write, I want all readers to understand that we all perceive and enjoy things differently. (& that's OK:)When I rented this movie, I read the words ""CIA"" & ""assassin"", like most casual movie-fans those words sparked a thought in my mind: Dang! This sounds kind of interesting, I will rent it for me and my family too watch... I wish I could go back in time and NOT think that and maybe rent something more ""action-packed"" like I had wanted.Sure, it had 'beautiful imagery' and all other artsy fartsy parts, but it lacked energy and strength. Picture a slinky that is still stuck together, it's hard and compact, but as soon as you throw it across the room, it's as floppy as a soggy waffle. That's what this movie is a floppy slinky that is just not worth putting back together.It's a good story, but was executed the wrong way. It's okay to give background information, but don't bore us with unnecessary information, that will only confuse the spectator, instead of INFORMING them.I doubt you will fall in love with the characters, let alone understand who they are & why they are even included in the story. Maybe they could have created more situations where the main character, Hanna, could have been a little more of a genetic human being (like what she's supposed to be) than an emotionless dead fly that's tied to a string and flung around as to make us get what her mission even is. All in all, I would not recommend this film to anyone wanting to be entertained and have a good time. Instead, watch it only if you have no other option or truly rather see a kaleidoscope of a movie (the bad kaleidoscope, the one that's broken.)*Next time, the director should actually get to the point.",Hanna
445,scandmaster,"Could have been great, but it's not!",3,7 January 2012,"It's very sad when a great story turn out bad because of unskilled directing. The story had all the major ingredients to create a world wide box office hit, if it was made different and with a greater understanding what a makes a good movie.The first part filmed in the frozen arctic, filmed in Finland gave me a feeling of, whoa this is a great movie, but that feeling left me very fast.After that the story and filming reminded me of some B- action movie that was made very fast and on an almost amateur level. Even the filming skills and the cinematographic level was after 20 minutes like someone with very limited financial opportunities made the film and therefore had to hurry up and do whatever possible just to finish the film.There are a lot of scenes in the film which are pure contradictions.1. Why should Hanna hit that tracking signal switch. If she was ready to rock roll, why just not leave that frozen place together with Eric Banas character 2. If Hanna was ready to start her ""hit man"" career, why did Banas character leave and left her behind all by herself. Why was it a problem to leave together. 3. Why raise someone without any connection to modern life if you wanna become a hit man in the modern world? If would probably buy that explanation if they had Internet there and she learned a lot of stuff online, for example what light is ( which she later on finds amazing)4. She had no problems to with Alien like capability kill a lot of people in the cottage and in the CIA facility ( or who they were). And very precise did she know every part of the underground facility which probably the authorized staff don't know. 5 The whole great facility was in a desert in Morocco, which is very stupid. The story would be more cool if it was somewhere in Spain or in some woods in Europe. This just doesn't make sense.6. She has kicked a lot of undercover guys and then she hardly can't beat a guy that looks like a hooligan. And this almost super human kind of girl, runs like a ordinary girl, with no visible signs of someone with enhanced muscles and DNA.7. She has never seen light, couldn't turn of the TV i Morocco and all the suddenly within matter of minutes in Berlin she becomes a computer wizard and finds all information about DNA on internet with minutes. I just don't buy that. That doesn't give a serious approach to this story. A girl almost afraid of modern technique, has no problem with computers after she's been raised in a wood without any connection with computers. I could continue to write 2 whole pages, but it is of no use. The girl who played Hanna did a good job, but could probably do a lot better with the right director. I honestly don't now why Cate Blanchett, one of the best in the modern cinematography decided to take part in this movie? The same goes for Eric Bana, what was he thinking?This could have been a great movie, with another director and more logical story. This film can't in any way be compared to Colombiana, which is one of the best films in the last 10 years.",Hanna

If you haven't seen it yet, it's definitely worth watching. You won't be disappointed. If you like action, thrillers, suspense and drama, you will love this movie as well. I think it has the total package; everything you'd want in a movie is there. The story is great. It allows you to feel so many different emotions. Eric B. and Cate B. were wonderful in this. And Hanna is so beautiful, inside and out. I very much enjoyed getting to know all of the characters in this film. One of my favorite things about this movie is the music. I am definitely going to buy the sound-track!",Hanna
447,mcmalden,One of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen,9,7 March 2012,"I am writing this review because of reading the negative reviews after seeing this movie. Personally I found this movie an emotional roller-coaster. After 5min I was at the edge of my seat and I never left it. Normally I loose my attention after about 10min but this movie really intrigued me. Probably due the brilliant acting by Saoirse Ronan and the soundtrack the chemical brothers.The biggest critique are the holes in the story and some unrealistic scenario's. I can find myself in some of them and in others I don't but both didn't spoil the fun for me. As much for not knowing the motives of the CIA etc.: Hanna might did neither. I think that it might has been the meaning of the story writer to put you in same situation Hanna was in. To let you experience a kind of childish ignorance. I my case this really succeeded. See it as something different. I didn't watch the trailer but it might raised the expectations of a bourne movie in which case you'll be greatly disappointed for sure.The only foul(in my eyes) in the story that I found pretty annoying was the fact that Hanna tells her and her 'dad's' rendezvous point to some children. In the beginning of the movie she's pretty much being brainwashed by her 'dad' and I can't imagine him not telling her to be discrete like a million times.Bottomline: if you are not looking for a movie with a genius plot and complex story lines but for a movie telling an interesting story about a young girl assassin, grown up in the wilderness, traveling through Europe having her first experiences with society('into the wild' in reverse if you will), combined with the some of the most beautiful music ever made: this might be the movie for you(sorry for the long sentence). Because this movie is really something special in my eyes I rate it 9 stars. I think it's a love/hate thing, three quarters of the people rate is below 4 and the remaining above 8: either you really like it or you really hate it.",Hanna
448,famesjarrelly,Great action thriller,7,11 March 2012,"Perhaps I'm reading too much into the film, but there is a bizarre maternal connection between Hanna and Marissa (the CIA agent). The bleeding gums scene might provide the only possible connection -- a blending of the DNA. Is it possible that it was Marissa's DNA that was used with the egg of the mother in order to assist in creating the ""perfect soldier."" After all, Marissa is the last one left standing. She has a kind of coldness that is shared by Hanna.....and the line "" I missed your heart"" takes on added meaning in that Hanna never knows any of her mother figures. Just wondering.",Hanna
449,kirababygirl7,Not What I Expected,6,30 June 2012,"I read a short summary of Hanna online and I thought it sounded interesting. But when I was finished watching it I sat on the couch for 5 minutes trying to figure out what had happened. It was not at all very descriptive, and I thought it was badly strung together. But then I watched it again, about a week later, and I finally understood everything. It is a kind of complicated story, and I wish that they spent more time explaining everything, rather then just mentioning it and moving on. But this movie wasn't entirely horrible. There where some bad parts, but overall it was a pretty good movie. Some of the acting could have been a little better, but most of it was excellent, and met my expectations.I think I liked it because it was somewhat unique. I expected it to be a little something like an action movie, but found myself with a storyline, that was strung together in what seemed a very short amount of time, but despite it's flaws I think it was an okay movie, which is why I rate it a 5.5 or a 6 out of 10.All in all, this movie was not at all what I expected.",Hanna
450,rnmdh07,"Exceptionally written, acted, and directed film masterpiece full of vibrant imagery and metaphor",9,5 May 2012,"I am simply amazed at how many people rate this movie poorly based on the simple plot inconsistencies or scenes requiring leaps of the imagination. There is so much obvious imagery and deeper metaphorical meaning to every scene, character, and non- action scene in the movie. Hanna begins with her sparse upbringing in a desolate playground where she is one with nature and her spiritual connection is with the earth and its creatures. As she hunts a deer she feels misery when she realizes her bowhunting kill was off the mark, missing the buck's heart. As nativist and animistic overtures she mercy kills the buck with her handgun. Her father, ex -CIA operative (Bana) has properly educated her, taught her multiple languages and readied her for her genetically predestined mission to right the wrongs of Society's hunger for consumption and technological mastery of the universe. In essence I believe there is a deeper message here as to the role of American anti- terrorism ventures and to what extent have we tolerated our government perpetrating crimes against humanity and human rights violations all in the name of The War on Terror. Blanchett plays the inhumane CIA chief who murdered Hanna's mother and will stop at nothing to silence Bans and obtain her genetic wunderkind Hanna. Hanna represents the innocence and passion and wonder that humanity is fully capable of and yet our consumer driven profit hungry corruption tinged political and corporate controlled society we currently endure. Hanna is in wonder when she sees light and electricity for the first time. She is in awe of technology and what excitement it can bring. The obvious metaphor to a Buddha -like upbringing where Hanna, the ultimate prophet /Messiah of the film/theme is totally sheltered for her entire life to that point having never even seen an electrical light or heard music from the music video on the TV. But this awe quickly turns to horror as she is overwhelmed by the music, fans rattling, electricity popping. Our humanity is so out of touch with true human nature and deeper spiritual connections to our family our friends and the physical world around us (nature, not your living room!). As Hanna escapes the CIA torture prison in Morrocco she meets a young British girl, an obvious slight to the preppy image consumed consumerite that all 15 year old Western girls are. Her parents are obvious hippies but the metaphor comes true when the obvious contrast to the altruistic and innocent to the world and its corrupt ways to degrade human experiences into fashion fame and fortune represented by the ostentatious British teen. The beautiful scenery imagery and cinematography combined with the original soundtrack by The Chemical Brother's makes this film exceptional. Put on your metaphor caps and truly appreciate a film that seeks to frame our world in an idealistic vision of what true humanity is capable of if we abandon our blood thirsty profit hungry consumer driven tirade that has severed our emotional and spiritual connections to one another and to the world we live in.",Hanna
451,aussiejames101,An extremely underrated movie,9,9 August 2012,"Clearly, this film has received mixed reviews, though having read many reviews after watching the film twice, it seems that almost all of the negative reviews fail to understand the film. Criticisms based on loopholes and plot failures, such as (SPOILER) why she is a threat to the US, or why she needs ""exterminating"" are from viewers who clearly haven't paid attention to the information handed to you on a plate. Those complaining about (SPOILER) her amazement to see electricity and TV in action despite having extensive knowledge of them forget that while she knows of such technology, she spent the first 16 years of her life in a technology free environment, a cabin in the woods, and hadn't experienced them in real life. The basis of the film is that an assassin's life is normal to her, whereas the use and experience of things such as music, or even a light are amazing to her, which is what makes the film so different from the rest.I could go on about the silly reviews and criticisms, but its pointless. Instead, I recommend you see it for yourself and experience its fantastic cinematography, mind blowing and original soundtrack and fresh, exciting and thoroughly modern take on a spy thriller.",Hanna

So this girl, Hanna, is apparently a genetically modified, fully trained super soldier who spends most of the movie running away from people that she could easily just kill. All of the chase scenes lack any semblance of thrill because of this fact. It's like watching a bear get chased down by a group of house cats. Furthermore, so much is left unexplained. Why did Hanna have to push the red button before leaving the cabin? Why did Hanna and her step-father have to separate only to rejoin each other later? Why did granny have to die? Why was Hanna able to use a computer so easily while still being baffled by a coffee maker? Too many unanswered questions and too many plot holes add up to one colossal waste of time.

From the start, I was beginning to suspect a somewhat B-rated movie. Well, I sat through it all in disbelief, not at the poor quality of the movie only, but the viewers who got this rating even above 4.The best of the lot must only go to actress, Saoirse Ronan who played the character of Hanna. She would have performed even better if actor, Eric Bana and actress, Cate Blanchett were replaced with the likes of Liam Neeson and any of a good number of great actresses out there. I've seen Eric Bana perform much better in a few of his previous movies. I wondered what happened in this one.Anyway, this review is for those who have not watched to not have high expectations and just to toleration a movie that appeared to have been made in a rushed-through manner without adhering to a high standard that exists in Hollywood movie making today.Just how I saw it.",Hanna
454,jana-montana_usa1,Disappointing.,4,3 January 2016,"A girl is raised by her father in a forest to be a perfect assassin and go on a mission. The description makes the movie sound very promising, like it's a good action filled movie maybe more on a dark side.Well that's where i was wrong when starting this movie.Absolutely all the action that was happening was quite horrible. It was both performed very lousy and in general it was unrealistic.Most importantly, though, i feel like the action and the fighting seemed to be really out of place. Often it looked like some kind of coming of age indie movie, with its cinematography, the dialogs and the scenes during the more calm moments with the family: in the camp and on the road. At those times i wished it was a coming of age indie film because those shots seemed to be the best ones, not the action filled ones.Maybe i have a very subjective view on how action should look like, i don't know, but surely i'm not the only one noticing the plot holes. Because they seemed to be all over the place.To begin with i really don't understand why the base was in Morocco and not in the US, but let's pretend they wanna show us how the US government is everywhere, WHO KNOWS.Why Marissa hired those three barely trained skin headed thugs if it was the matter of the national security?Why was she the only one so concerned about it?And the thing that still haunts me after i've finished the film: why did it look like Marissa had something very personal going on with Hanna? Up until the end i expected her to say she's her mother or something just as crazy, reveal some big plot twist at the end but i'm left unsatisfied and confused.Cate Blanchett's acting was as usual amazing, and her character really did look in pain near the end every time she looked at Hanna, like she wanted to say her something, like she was some kind of her long lost daughter she was oh so relieved to finally find, i don't know. I feel like a part of the movie was cut out and no one told me anything.One more thing besides the slower scenes and Blanchett's acting that made the movie not as ridiculous as it could be was the soundtrack. Amazing tracks by the Chemical Brothers that didn't deserve the scenes they were placed on.Underwhelming and disappointing.",Hanna

It is hard with dividing ones, because some people can't understand art movies but there are some art movies I simply don't want to watch if it's 'pretentious'... I don't think I will watch this movie again, but there were certain parts, especially towards the end where you could feel what it could've been...MUCH BETTER. I would've focused on the haunting visuals than the premature girl's stuff... When the whole Grimm-house part comes in, it's just good to watch. I loved Hanna's escape too. The deer-symbol's return at the end was precious, but once again it was a bit out of context compared to the previous part of the movie. There were other visual treats in the movie, such as the dead bodies on the playground,slowly circulating,Marissa standing in the mouth of the Big Bad Wolf; and the red neon reminded me of the visual language of the recent Nicholas Winding Refn movie(trailer), Only God Forgives.",Hanna

I saw it on HBO, so my perspective is different than if I'd paid for a ticket, but that's not my point.My point is that I've read some of the other reviews and those who consistently diss the movie do so by citing its plot inconsistencies, unrealistic action, etc.Hello.It's a movie.Movies aren't real.Movies are movies.Movies have inconsistencies.Movie have plot holes.Most movies don't make sense (if you look close).But who cares? If you want real, go to work. Go visit the relatives. Go walk the dog. Go to school. Go rob a bank.That's real.Movies are entertainment.They exist because real is, for the most part, dull as watching paint dry.That's why people pay 10 bucks to sit in the dark watching actors doing things that aren't real.That said, I enjoyed Hanna.Saoirse Ronan is adorable (though, given my age, I kinda feel like a pedophile saying that), both Jessica Barden and Olivia Williams are funny and Cate Blanchett goes all out against tooth decay - UUraahh.So what if she's faster than a speeding locomotive in heals.That's the point.It's a movie.In any event, Hanna is well worth 10 bucks (even if, since it was on HBO, it didn't cost me more than the 90 minutes I spent watching it).",Hanna
457,GreenCarpet,Adapt or leave,2,15 May 2011,"I can't remember the last time I left the theater after less than an hour into a movie. It can't have happened more than twice so far, but it did happen with this movie (and that would probably make it a third time in a lifetime). The movie is genuinely annoying - it can't be a good sign if you look at your watch every ten minutes just to find again and again that only very little time has passed. To give him credit, Jon Wright tries to reflect the inner clash of worlds that Hanna lives through in his editing, directing, filming. We are transported from the cold, silent arctic winters, via a long walk through the desert (slightly less silent), to the Spanish sun as Hanna transitions from killer machine to something like a teenager. The cold light, obscure atmospheres and lifeless surroundings of the CIA operative's world are interwoven with the warm colors, abundant life and friendly people of Morocco and southern Spain. Staccato editing and hectic filming make room for the smooth filming of a hippie road movie. And the wooden and serious characters from Langley clash with -- the lipstick fantasies of a 16 year old. Unfortunately, the clash of styles doesn't entirely prove helpful and the symbolism is too obvious to be inspiring. The editing is at times overpowering, the camera misplaced - trying to squeeze something out of the plot that just isn't there. The flight from an underground CIA base becomes a study in Manga action style filming, but adds art where it doesn't help. At other times the directing becomes so plain vanilla that it simply makes art the accessory of a boring story.The story - with an intriguing idea at the start, it turns into a tale about a teenager's discovery of life and, in between odd chase scenes, experiences a sudden, temporary change of genre. And a not so temporary change of excitement. The never ending portrayal of the girl's endless naivety doesn't thrill - the times that an audience enjoyed watching someone who doesn't know how to use a light switch have passed. And the use of (seemingly) long fillers (e.g., Spanish folk singers that don't add anything neither to atmosphere nor story) creates the impression there wasn't enough plot to fill the film. My detailed ratings (out of 5): Action 2/5 Humour 0/5 Directing 1/5 Acting 2/5 Story 1/5 Soundtrack 0/5The poster at the theater read: ""A contemporary Leon"". It isn't.

Cate Blanchette makes an outstanding, heartless villain. Ms Ronan is an excellent actress who was wholly believable in action and emotional content. The music by the Chemical Bros is unique and memorable, and adds to the intrigue of the movie. The plot is average for a thriller, and some of it requires suspension of disbelief as many movies of this genre do. However, it was put together so well that it keeps your attention throughout.

First off, this is a Jason Bourne meets Run Lola Run action thriller with Ridley Scott/Luc Besson undertones.The film, and I specifically use the word film, has a late 20th century feel, from the visual aesthetics and choice of automobiles portrayed, to the overall ambiance. As the film progresses, Hanna's world gets larger and larger, with a very believable portrayal by Saoirse Ronan in the title role. The fight scenes are choreographed very well, and Ronan's ability to execute them flawlessly for one as young a she, great things are indeed expected from this actor.I am hesitant to give away any plot points as I went in blind, only having remembered I was very interested by seeing the trailer in 2011. If you are a fan of the original La Femme Nikita, or the Bridget Fonda remake by Luc Besson, this is a film for you; or maybe The Professional is more your speed, then you really need to see this movie!!!!

460,Johnnytoby4,Girl Trained from birth to be assassin,7,18 February 2013,"""I just missed your heart"". The opening lines of this action packed movie is what I felt like watching it; It almost got my attention, but failed to fully deliver as a story since the characters were not fleshed out enough, Hanna having many inconsistencies in her character and a mediocre plot. The movie involves a young girl trained from birth to be an assassin. Throughout the movie you get a few scant glances at ""why"" she was trained to be one. But even these glimpses are so far and in-between you would think that the whole movie is just one giant scene in a larger production.The characters are not fleshed out and their motives extremely unclear. It is never fully explained on why the main antagonist, Marissa Wiegler, a Special agent, killed Hanna's mother nor why she was so intent on chasing Hanna and her father. Hanna's father was also a major mystery and his motives unclear at best. When Marissa hired a hit man to capture the girl and kill her father, it was a letdown. Expecting a badass bounty hunter, the movie instead treated the viewer to a blond lanky guy wearing a yellow running suit. The ""hitmen"" in all honestly felt like a common thug who seemed unprofessional and untrained. It seemed like all the characters were not there to draw you into a deep well written story but simply there as placeholders for the action sequences.To be honest, the movie could have been condensed into one or two scenes of a different movie. The action was awesome and well scripted, but the plot was dis-interesting and did not explain the situation well. While I love assassin type stories, I also enjoy a plot that at least has a sensible beginning and ending, which this did not really have. It was never explained why the American government would go deep into Russian north with a special ops team for one man that has been missing for a decade. The movie in general felt like one drawn out action scene that did not really cover all of its bases nor keep track of the scene they had painted. I understand movies do not have all the time in the world to lay out the plot, but at least make it more sensible so that it can draw in the movie goers rather than make you feel like a bystander.Throughout the movie there were inconsistencies in the trained assassin, Hanna. In one scene, she kills multiple armed military personnel in the matter of seconds and escapes from them with little effort, but in another, she can't handle 3 thugs and fights them for over five minutes finally having to escape by diving away. As a trained assassin she had been trained to kill and adapt to any situation, but consistently ran away by the skin of her teeth from her pursuers, leaving a trail of dead people who helped her. She never fights them with her years of assassin training but instead lets them chase her endangering everyone she meets. Later in the movie, Hanna finds out her father lied to her and leaves him for not explaining everything to her, which did not make sense with how they had built Hanna up as a trained assassin who can handle any situation, even ones that were a surprise to her. Throughout the movie her enemies constantly get the jump on her, which did not make much sense. Over all the years of training in the wilderness and against her father, she should have been able to easily hunt down her pursuers and take them down.In the end, the movie was a good action movie, but failed to deliver as a thrilling assassin type of movie. The main character instead of being a badass assassin, is instead a girl who seemingly only remembered she is an assassin in the first fight, but slowly reverts to a normal girl without any training except to hide. The supporting characters felt bland and out of place in a assassin movie and the plot felt inconsistent. How I felt after watching it was exactly what Hanna said at the beginning, ""I Just missed your heart.""",Hanna

Looking for mass gun play / you will be disappointed........If you want car chases / you will be disappointed...... If you want explosions and big action set pieces / you will be disappointed.... It is not that kind of movie. It is however a great movie. I saw no plot holes. At no point did I think how did that happen?If Skyfall can be considered the best bond film ever made blah blah blah. Then this beats that movie hands down. If you are mad for action movies. Then this is not for you. If you want to watch, a quite compelling story. Then this might be for you. One thing it will not be is a rubbish movie.",Hanna
463,andybazarov,did not like the plot,5,2 July 2013,"I hate to write a bad review for this film, since there are a lot of good things to find in it, the cast is great, i love the photography and music.. it saddens me to see all this hard work spent when the result is very mediocre.I really don't appreciate in this movie:the plot: it seems as if the director didn't really invent anything new here. the plot is a mixture of a few films I can think of: 1. the fifth element 2. Rambo 3. shooter (which actually also is taken all from Rambo)If you don't have anything new to say, don't say nothing at all..2. the characters personality: I love all main the actors, they are amazing, but in this film they don't express their true acting skills because the characters are very dull and superficial. like puppets in a show. 3. no spoilers - didn't like the ending let's just say that for my personal taste, and without making a spoiler, I really didn't like the ending. it disappointed me so much that I've stopped the film before it ended and didn't actually see the entire film.this is why i'm writing this review and spending so much time with it. I don't mean to offend anyone, I just have to say that this movie could have been a lot better, and I really hope you guys in the movie industry will pay more attention in the future to these kind of (basic) things. I don't think it's supposed to happen in films like this. your audience is not stupid, and he is not amused by explosions and shooting arrows and stuff. it all has to mean something first, otherwise it's just a waist of time.

464,willhgreen,Pile of rubbish,1,16 October 2013,this film is a pretentious piece of rubbish that in my own personal opinion deserves to be set alight in a trash can and spat on by the cast and creators of the film for the rubbish job that they have done.Each one of the screenwriters should just quit their jobs and Love in Tuscany for the rest of their days as an alpaca. I can honestly say without a doubt this film was the worst piece of drivel that i have ever scene within the cinema and i would like too defecate over all remaining copies of this film.I would like to personally take this opportunity to say once again how the thought of watching this film ever again or allowing other civilised human beings to watch this film would/ should be against the law as when i watched this film along with my smart and sexy associate at the time i wanted to claw my eyes out.,Hanna
465,Aerlix,"Wonderful film, a Gothic fantasy, like a dream, enchanting.",9,8 August 2012,"I think a great deal of frustration can come about trying to see this film like a modern action thriller. It is not that, although it has many of the associated dressings. It is a fairytale, it is a journey into a very old story with very modern twists; the world is Gothic and it is strange and it is most certainly not supposed to be plausible. It is a little girl trying to escape a witch, except the little girl is also an assassin (amazing). Director Joe Wright really took a risk on this one, and clearly it hasn't gelled with an awful lot of people. I've seen it a few times now, and each time I re-visit it I love it more. It comes across as an artistic labour of love (the care lavished on some of the lengthy shots is amazing) that offers very few concessions a wide audience. It is a modern-day Grimm tale. I note a lot of people raging because of it's frequent segues from plausibility, and whilst you are not wrong to observe it's lack of plausibility I think the point has been missed. Some shots strain believability I agree, but I think they worked nevertheless. A certain amount of this film is style over substance, a certain amount of reality is sacrificed for a mood of surreality, and I think it was entirely intentional and successful. This film does not dwell in the real world, there is something 'other' about it, something entirely fantastical. Not like super-hero films, where they break the rules of the real world but explain how it has been done through special powers, I am talking about a more fundamental yet subtle break from reality that is all the more chilling for it's understated deviation. This is a world of fantasy, with some of the shifting expectations of a dream. Some of it is like a beautiful dream, some of it is like a nightmare, actually I thought watching it was a lot like being read a frightening fairytale as a child, with that thrilling sense of disorientation you get from imagining a universe governed by unfamiliar rules. A friend and I were discussing how the film had a very British theatrical feel, and people outside of a certain audience would perhaps have trouble with it. The family seemed to bother a lot of people in particular. Coming from a British middle-class background they just absolutely nailed it, but in way that really might escape say an American who is used to the usually marketed brand of 'Britishness'. Heck someone from outside south-east England might cock an eyebrow. Parts of this film even reminded me of the feel of 90's British trip- pop, like a Mazzy Star song, with that feeling of falling into a waking dream, and a big part of that was the sound-track by The Chemical brothers, who themselves crossed in and out of that movement at times in their catalogue. I don't mean to condescend to anyone who disliked it, I just mean to say to the people who feel it is objectively a terrible film, that to me and some people I know at least, it was mesmerising and beautiful from start to finish. With the sweeping cinematography, otherworldly feel and beautiful soundtrack I was swept into a trance, completely absorbed. I adore it, and I cannot thank Joe Wright and the whole team enough for making a film with a vision that is so wonderfully un-compromised. If anyone who dis-liked it has the stomach to re-watch it, trying to see it as Gothic fantasy and not a modern action thriller I think at least a few of you might see the gem the rest of us love so much.In summary:Do not read anything from the trailer, it will give you the impression you are going to another Bourne movie. It is not an action thriller at all. If you liked Caché, Mullholland Drive, Enduring Love or Winters Bone, or perhaps even Old Boy or Amelie, and are have a taste for things done a little differently, please give it a try, some of you will find a film that will stay with you.",Hanna
466,MichiganReview,Looking forward to a sequel.,10,17 December 2013,"I did not see the film in theaters like the earlier reviewers. I waited for cable viewing and well worth the wait. The acting of the main character was outstanding and believable. We have watched the film over a dozen times and it never gets boring. Just a pro-women movie, full of action and adventure. Music also has a lot of action all in the right places. The scores are done perfectly, I did not arrive at a conclusion due the music, it just kept up with the anticipation. I would of paid thirty dollars(for 2) to see at the theater opposed to say ""gravity"". If I hadn't of seen ""Gravity"" in 3D, I would of been highly disappointed. I too hope for a sequel of ""Hanna"".",Hanna
467,kimani-wambui33,Best. Movie. Ever.,9,18 December 2013,"Hanna is one of the most confusing, symbolic, crazy, unreal, but also amazing movies °̩ have had the chance of watching.°̩ love the characters. Especially the character of Hanna. She is strong (extremely) fast, fit, dangerous, but also beautiful. Although she was bred in a test tube, and was meant to be a super soldier, she still has human traits. She is honest, trustworthy, and emotional, like any other teenage girl. The movie has very many twists, for example, how her ""father"" dies suddenly, its not one of those movies where everybody will live happily ever after, once they have killed all the villains of course. Its a movie where you are left in suspense, and you never know what's going to happen next. Some of the lines the characters say, have very good symbolism. For example the first line in the movie is ""°̩ just missed your heart"" and the last line is also ""°̩ just missed your heart"". This brings the whole story back to the start, and does not leave you with loose ends. All together- a pretty great movie according to my standards!",Hanna
468,timothy-scott-robinson,Souless Alice in Hitland by an amateur music video maker,5,11 May 2014,"Souless Alice in a musical Hitland by an amateur music video maker. Something missing in a big way: a train of clichés, adapted retakes of classic scenes, chaotic location hopping but most of all an absence of any human dimension. Shallow cartoon like bad people, and absolutely no character development or depth in most of the cast. Attempted humour in places that fails and is incongruent with the subject. Most of the cast end up dead in clichéd total certainty or just vanish from the plot. The sound track appears to attempt to put connection and flow into the narrative but ends up dissociating it into a series of storyboard clip-ettes like cutting room remnants at an ad production house. Pass on this. An largely empty tin can of a movie that barely warrants making up the ten line post requirement here.",Hanna
469,trinity003,It was good until...,5,9 January 2015,"Yes this contains spoilers! So beware... Wow.. so after finishing watching the Bourne Legacy, I wanted to choose another one. Netflix had been after me for quite some time on this one. Saw the trailer and thought.. wow(!) Cate Blanchett, Eric Bana and Saoirse Ronan. AND music by Chem Bros. So the first half was good.. I did enjoy the art house part, less so the random violence by others (Cate). And WHAT was with her accent? Why such a bad American accent? No fault of Cate, but why some odd Southern one? I also glossed over the whole upbringing.. fine you live in the Arctic and get to Morroco and attach yourself to Hummers.. fine.. and suddenly you are a kill machine against Lady Mary! MORE SPOILERS.. OK once she hit the fun house.. or whatever the old abandoned kids park was.. it was all downhill from there. Sure Eric Bana you can kill 5 men at one time, but the Looneys x 3 will find you in the end and Cate B will give you a shoot shoot bang bang goodbye. How AWFUL for that character? Where's the Transporter or Jason Bourne when you need him?Then for Hanna wispy teen to say Please I don't want to kill anymore.. and spring goes the arrow and bang goes the gun. And she's OK? How the heck do you climb stairs and ladders with being shot in the stomach? I'm sorry I guess I'm more old fashioned.. the movie just ends with a Bang.. and I thought oh I just wasted the last hour of my life to have this movie end like this. Tragic. Enjoyed the soundtrack.. and the acting (please no more bad American accents.. ) but the plot and writing was all off in the end. I now feel gutted.. literally.",Hanna
470,thechrismeister,So great I am hoping for a sequel,10,20 August 2011,"Before I watched this movie I looked at a few trailers and pretty much had a good understanding what it would be about. And to be honest, the story turned out that way also. BUT, it was still so much better. And let me tell you why.Even though we have seen parts of the storyline in many other movies, I am so impressed with how they managed to make this so interesting. The script is amazing, and even though you pretty much know what will happen, every scene in the movie still has a little twist in some way. Maybe a scene turned out more brutal than you expected, or maybe someone said something that was not really the textbook answer you always get. All through the movie I kept getting a feeling of ""wow"" and ""oh"" if you know what I mean. Also I am impressed with how Joe Wright was able to captivate the audience in every scene. It felt like every angle was so perfectly thought of in advance which brought so much quality feel to the movie.Saoirse Ronan pretty much has become my favorite female actress. She is only 17 but acts better then most Hollywood bigshots. She is so natural in her acting, and you really believe she is Hanna. Even though it was a great script, I don't think it would have been such a great experience without Saoirse.I am sure most people will think this is a great movie. It really offers something for everyone and I promise you, you won't be disappointed. I for sure hope we will see a sequel to this.",Hanna

472,bradthebrratt,Mind numbing,1,14 June 2015,"Browsing through movies at my local JbHiFi store I came across this movie. Having read a decent review about it in the Empire magazine I purchased it. Cate Blanchett, Eric Bana and Saoirse Ronan. What could go wrong? Correct? Pretty much everything in 106 minutes of sheer torture. Haphazard direction of an incoherent plot/storyline just ensured that this cinematic offering was not going to appease the masses. Unless you were a lemming. To rate this movie higher than the 1 that I gave it would be a travesty. You can see a germ of an idea that the writers Seth Lochhead and David Farr are trying hard to plait together but the finished product just does not gel. I have watched a lot of movies and this is the first time I felt compelled to be so critical about one. It actually made me take the time to create an id to login and review it.",Hanna
473,meisterman,Chemical Brothers & the 3 Henchmen are the STARS!,8,5 April 2011,"An average movie with no original ideas was bumped up to a memorable movie because of the original score by the Chemical Brothers and the very dark, mischievous, and psychotically funny 3 henchmen (especially Tom Hollander whose character reminded me a lot of Elle Driver when whistling ""the devil is in the beats"" throughout the movie). Immediately after seeing the movie, I had to buy songs because of the addictive score that you cannot get out of your head.The directing by Joe Wright also includes an honorable mention for separating this movie from all the other thrillers. His artistic style made the movie seem more intense and kept the audience engaged even during scenes where Hanna is trying to come to understand the real world.I cannot do a review without mentioning the amazing (and in my opinion, blows Dakota Fanning out of the water) Saoirse Ronan. No words can explain how awesome she is. Just see the movie!",Hanna

476,rstoverc,Alice In Wonderland Remix,10,12 August 2016,"This movie has been out for a while and it has fallen under my radar. I finally sat down and watch it and strongly feel it has been based on Alice in Wonderland. You have a strong blonde, blue eyed, girl who can overcome all obstacles. She has trained with the white rabbit who guides her on her journey to defeat the Queen of hearts that they fear. She has no fear and by ""coincidence"" from the start and finish of the movie stated, ""I just missed the heart"". Also by chance, Cate Blanchett aka Marissa wears a head laced in bright gold red locks as to portray the queen. The gang Marissa enlists seems to be wearing the same uniform as a deck of cards. The family Hanna seems to follow throughout the movie, seems to be the family of the Mad Hatter. The Magician she runs into near the end who tells her the whole story as if to be Tweedledee and Tweedledum, where he plays both sides but ultimately protecting Alice. This can be a stretch but this movie is no original form but them adaptation of Alice in Wonderland. Overall, great movie and was well executed.",Hanna
477,rjdriver,A Very Special Movie,10,7 May 2014,"Look past the ""many times done before"" story line. Ignore the few plot holes and occasionally unrealistic looking location shots. Suspend a bit of disbelief.Then, sit back and enjoy probably one of the three best revenge movies ever made. Charles Bronson - meet Hanna! This movie is masterfully shot and paced. Pull this into it's component parts and you'll find much to criticize on some of the acting and writing, but taken as a whole, for what it is - a single minded revenge story - it's mesmerizing and brilliant from beginning to end. To the reviewer who said the characters were two dimensional and not motivated - well of course Hanna was two dimensional. She was raised in the wild by a single parent and taught religiously to prepare herself for a single act. But not motivated? What exactly were you doing while you tried to watch this movie? It's on Netflix disc, Amazon Instant for a couple of bucks, or buy it at Wal-Mart for $4.99. You'll know in the first 15 minutes whether you will stick with it or not. If you are not drawn in by then, it may not be your kind of movie. But don't skip this based on the bad reviews you read here. It's a small investment to find what I consider an unheralded gem.",Hanna
478,rgwhitaker,Hanna huh?,1,8 April 2011,"So many other people on this list seemed to have loved this movie. I'll be the odd man out, I guess.I think I was the only person on the planet who didn't like ""Inception,"" so I may be the only person as well who thought that this movie simply stunk! It was boring, slow, and I couldn't get in to any of the characters. I never understood why Cate Blanchett's character was even after Hannah or her father. What was her motivation? And why was she such a closet whack-job? (Perhaps the answer to those questions flashed by on the screen when I was fantasizing about getting up and leaving, or when I was kicking myself for not having gone to ""Source Code"" instead.) Anyway, these lame roles were WAY below the skills and abilities of such excellent actors as Cate Blanchett and Eric Bana.I wouldn't recommend this movie. ""Hop"" would have been a better choice.",Hanna
479,jbstoker13,"sugar high, limited nutritional content",3,8 April 2011,"The cinematography was of high quality, and the principle characters were unique and even entertaining. However, there was not enough back-story for me to feel any necessity for the protagonists to successfully arrive at their rendezvous point. Was it just a place in the modern world where they could live together in peace; or was it a launching point to expose the antagonist? I certainly couldn't tell. Even more troubling: Why fire off a signal beacon to the baddies to tell them that you are coming? I can only reason that it was to draw out the antagonist. If so, I hold that there were subtle ways more effective for cutting the head off of the snake. And, traveling is a whole lot easier without an recently activated APB.Amidst the weak storyline were some great fight scenes and (a few) characters that drew you in. The high-quality camera-work and music also kept my attention, and created a mood of steadily rising apprehension. Sadly, what appeared to be rising conflict proved only to be plot shortcomings that never came full circle. A sugar high that came crashing down, as I mull the thought ""that was cool, but why did they do it....""",Hanna
