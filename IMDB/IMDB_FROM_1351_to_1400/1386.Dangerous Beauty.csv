0,SnoopyStyle,sex and power,8,18 November 2016,"It's later-half sixteen century Venice. Most women are illiterate and treated as property. There are limited opportunities for lower status women except for the courtesans who are the stars of society. Senator's son Marco Venier (Rufus Sewell) returns to the city and falls for childhood friend Veronica Franco (Catherine McCormack). She is young and innocent. They become lovers but Marco has to get into a political marriage. Veronica is heart-broken and wants to enter a convent. Her mother (Jacqueline Bisset) reveals that she was a former courtesan and offers to train her. Veronica becomes highly sought after in high society including Marco but also enemies like Marco's cousin Maffio Venier (Oliver Platt). There is war against the Ottoman, political intrigue with France, and the darkness of the Inquisition.This is a compelling story of sex and power from the woman's point of view. It's romantic and a feminist journey. Catherine McCormack is a little old to play the ingenue but she fits the bill with beauty and determination. Jacqueline Bisset is perfect for her role. The intrigue and romance all work painting a compelling picture of a historical moment and place.",Dangerous Beauty
1,claudio_carvalho,One of the Most Beautiful Love Storiesand Based on a True Story,10,8 January 2009,"In 1583, Venice is the richest and most decadent city in Europe and its women are treated like property and few even knew how to read. The youth and witty Veronica Franco (Catherine McCormack) and the wealthy Marco Venier (Rufus Sewell), who is the brother of her best friend Beatrice (Moira Kelly), are in love for each other, but her mother can not afford the dowry for their marriage. When Marco tells Veronica that they can not marry to each other because he should have a marriage of state and his parents would oppose due to their social differences, Veronica's mother Paola Franco (Jacqueline Bisset) tells her heartbroken daughter that she was a courtesan in the past, and now Veronica shall learn how to be a courtesan to support the family. The poetess Veronica becomes the most famous courtesan in Venice, loved by the powerful elite except Marcos. When the Turks threaten Cyprus, Veronica spends the night with King Henry (Jake Weber) and he gives the necessary ships to protect Cyprus. When the Inquisition comes to Venice, she is accused of witchcraft by the Church.""Dangerous Beauty"" is one of the most beautiful love stories I have ever seen, and based on a true story. Catherine McCormack is extremely gorgeous and this is probably her best role along her career, with a stunning performance. This movie is quite perfect, with a wonderful story, excellent screenplay, magnificent direction, witty dialogs, a fantastic cast and awesome cinematography, set decoration and costumes in the environment of Venice in the Sixteenth Century. It is impressive how this movie excited me with the most different emotions and I have just included it in my list of favorites. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Em Luta Pelo Amor"" (""In Fight for Love"")",Dangerous Beauty
2,kosmasp,Danger .. but for whom?,8,3 February 2021,"There was a time when women of not just a certain profession did not have an easy standing. But then again women still have a tough standing in general even in todays more open society for a multiple of reasons. Let's just say they had it even tougher back then.The story and the movie is helped by the incredible cast. So many talented people in front of the camera ... and they had fun doing the movie as is apparent. There's some nudity in this, but this is not that type of movie and it should not cast a shadow on your viewing experience (for those who are easily offended that is, everyone else won't mind or just nod in acknowledgment of some of the actors having the courage to go that way for the story). Very intriguing and quite incredible story",Dangerous Beauty
3,sunwarrior13,Great Performances Makes It More Than Just A Melodramatic Film,9,12 January 2015,"Dangerous Beauty is a biopic that was based on a novel entitled The Honest Courtesan by Margaret Rosenthal.It is about a courtesan,Veronica Franco during the 16th century who became a hero and later became a target of an inquisition by the Church for witchcraft. It stars Catherine McCormack together with Rufus Sewell,Oliver Platt,Naomi Watts,Jacqueline Bisset and Moira Kelly.While there is nothing groundbreaking about the story and the film itself,the performances of the cast transformed it into becoming more than just a melodramatic movie.Jacqueline Bisset and Moira Kelly are outstanding as Veronica's mother and Beatrice respectively.And definitely,Catherine McCormack was flawless from one scene to another whether it was dramatic or comedic as the main character,Veronica.Added to that,the cinematography and the production effects were also noteworthy that it provided the film great look of film that took place centuries ago.One more thing about it is we get to one of the better films that is told from a woman's point of view particularly that of an interesting character such as that of a courtesan.This is definitely worth watching.",Dangerous Beauty
4,AaronCapenBanner,Veronica Franco,6,3 December 2013,"Marshall Herskovitz directed this sumptuous looking drama set in 16th century Venice. Catherine McCormack plays real life woman Veronica Franco, who out of necessity becomes a courtesan to the rich and powerful men of the royal court after being properly tutored by her experienced mother(played by Jacqueline Bisset) though really loves a nobleman(played by Rufus Sewall) whom she is unable to marry, though when the worsening plague strikes the city, women like her are put on trial by the inquisition, prompting him to come to her public defense. Though uneven dramatically, this film is well-acted and still a most interesting look at that point in history.",Dangerous Beauty
5,whpratt1,The Life of a Courteson,9,27 February 2006,"Discovered this film on late night TV and enjoyed this great historical film with drama, romance, sex and plenty of action. Catherine McCormack, (Veronica Franco),""Spy Game"",'01, was a young woman who fell madly in love with Rufus Sewell ,(Marco Venier),""Victoria Station"",'03, at a very early age. It was almost love at first sight and the couple wanted to marry and become Soul Mates in one flesh together. However, the Venetian Laws of the land dictated that this man or woman must marry into only certain rich and noble families. In other words, Marco & Veronica were not able to become man and wife as they so desired beyond your wildest dreams. Veronica is trained by her mother to become a Courteson of Venice and she proceeds to service all kinds of sex hungry men, from men in the clergy to every sort of man who wanted a one night stand. There is great acting and lots of interesting situations which all wind up in a so called Court of Law in Venice.",Dangerous Beauty

A light comedy-drama to be adored by dreamers and condemned by realists, ""Dangerous Beauty"" is a wholly enjoyable little tale of the downtrodden surmounting the powerful,  love conquering all, goodness winning over righteousness, and all those other things people go to movies to enjoy. A fun rainy night video rental for those into period flicks. (B+)",Dangerous Beauty
7,inkblot11,"Beautiful, indeed, but only for adults",8,26 June 2006,"Veronica Franco is a poor Venetian girl, with no dowry or marital prospects. She is in love with the rich boy next door. There is to be no happy ending, it seems, for Marco's parents arrange for him to marry another woman. Marco reluctantly tells Veronica he must do as they say. Stunned, Veronica turns to her mother for advice. Mama Mia! Mama recommends she become a courtesan, a high, high class of street walker. Veronica will receive an education superior to those offered other girls, beautiful clothes, and the opportunity to become wealthy in her own right. And, mother says, Veronica will be able to have Marco, too, if she wants him, for he can become a paying customer, no? This is truly a lovely movie, despite the somewhat controversial subject matter. In the day of the courtesan, ladies did get the opportunity to become better educated and scale the social ladder through the selling of their services. The script does this story justice, the costumes and settings are wonderful, and the main actors give strong portrayals. McCormack is beautiful beyond belief and Rufus Sewell, who plays Marco, delights in ways unimaginable. However, the world's oldest profession is not a subject for family viewing and is certainly the case here. Also, the Catholic church is shown in an unflattering manner, causing some offense, perhaps. Nevertheless, the extreme beauty of the film demands a viewing by all true movie enthusiasts. It is very much a standout among historical dramas on film.",Dangerous Beauty
8,clanciai,The Renaissance culture in conflict with the Inquisition in 16th century Venice,10,2 November 2018,"There are many remarkable facts about this film. Not the least remarkable one is that it is a true story. Another is that it is the only film Marshall Herskovitz has directed - he is more well known as a producer. It is probably both Catherine MacCormack's and Rufus Sewell's best performances ever, but then parts like this actually invited to it. The supreme asset of the film is however its bringing 16th century Venice alive on the screen with its sumptuous culture and way of life, with its glory and beauty and above all the importance of the courtesans and their influence on all aspects of Venitian society - style, education, politics and social life. Jacqueline Bisset plays the mother who sees no other choice than to give her daughter over to be educated as a courtesan. The social position of these in Venice of the Renaisance can only be compared with that of the courtesans in ancient Athens - Percles' celebrated partner Aspasia was a courtesan.The music by George Fenton adds to the general overwhelming beauty of the film, and there are many other important actors, all of them good, like Jeroen Krabbé as the father, a brilliant actor who is rarely seen but always in outstanding parts (like Handel in ""Farinelli""). Most spectacular is probably the poet duels, one being a typical occasion at a party, the other getting more serious with rapiers as well as words, with Catherine McCormack against a later leading inquisitor.It's definitely one of the major love films of all times, perhaps even more romantic than any other. I have now seen it three times, it was better each time, so there will probably be more occasions.",Dangerous Beauty
9,Thanos_Alfie,Catherine McCormack...,6,24 May 2020,"""Dangerous Beauty"" is a Biography - Romance movie in which we watch a young woman becoming a courtesan without having other choice in 1583, Venice. From the start she has to fight for everything and later on she is being accused of witchcraft by the church and she has to fight for truth too.I have to say that I did not know what to expect from this movie but it amazed me. The plot of the movie was very interesting with many good scenes and also the way that the society and also the political scenery were presented made it even more interesting. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, I believe that Catherine McCormack who played as Veronica Franco made one of her best performances if not the best, Jacqueline Bisset who played as Paola Franco was also very good and Rufus Sewell who played as Marco Venier was equally good. Lastly, I have to say that ""Dangerous Beauty"" is a very good movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it because it presents very well many truths of that time.",Dangerous Beauty
10,filipemanuelneto,An interesting romantic drama with historical background.,7,7 October 2016,"Everyone knows that prostitution is the oldest ""profession"" of the world (in most countries its not considered a profession, in fact may even be illegal). This film is about a group of ancient luxury prostitutes, very common in the major European cities: the courtesans. The film is not a documentary but is based on real facts, and portrays with some accuracy the social limbo where these women were: they were generally accepted by society but never came to be part of it, they were usually the most educated women but they weren't taken seriously by men.The script is good, the story is good and the actors do a great job as well. Catherine McCormack played the courtesan Veronica and got, with this film, her most significant work, reaching the top of her career. She perfectly joined her youthful beauty, almost innocent, with an excellent interpretative talent. In turn, Rufus Sewell, who plays the gallant Marco Venier, also makes a good performance, giving a touch of passionate despair to his character. Some dialogues are worthy of quotation thanks to its quality. The picture is very colorful and bright, which is nice, except when abused red tones, and it happened in several scenes. The soundtrack fulfills her role well, but it could be much better if it had included musical pieces from that period, as in the film ""Casanova"", also set in Venice. The filming locations are interesting, but we barely realize the beauty of that city. Venice is famous for its unique beauty and, in this film, we only see the channels and bridges.Apart from some flaws and some edges that could have been honed, the movie is good and worth watching it.",Dangerous Beauty
11,noralee,Period Romantic Romp,6,8 November 2005,"I saw a ""Sneak Preview"" of ""Dangerous Beauty"" last night as I had no interest in the Olympics that everyone else was watching on TV. It's a fun romantic romp, not very deep, despite the veneer of feminism, sort of a serious ""Gigi"" without the music, originally titled ""Courtesan"" but TPTB were afraid no one would know what that was.It's a costume drama with (female) nudity and four letter words, gee just like they must have spoken if they spoke English in Venice.The sets were obviously mattes, but quite pretty.I've liked Rufus Sewall since ""Middlemarch"" on ""Masterpiece Theatre.""Jaqueline Bisset makes a grande older dame, and her comments about her conquests when young have a nice resonance with real life.Some actors who don't usually get to don corset and hose get to dress up, like Fred Ward, Justine Miceli, and Moira Kelley, and are surprisingly good at it. But the movie is basically the lead woman as she's in every scene and Catherine McCormick is quite captivating.(originally written 2/22/1998)",Dangerous Beauty
12,begob,Put asunder these genres,5,21 July 2017,"A star crossed lover in Reformation Venice has no choice but to become a courtesan, but when the moralists fix her in their sights who will come to her defence? A helluva story struggling to burst out of this production. We're consciously in Shakespeare territory, with some witty exchanges between the lovers and their peers, delivered in metrical dialogue. The lovers' dilemma is presented with aching charm, and the sets and costumes give lavish support to a story that is well performed. But it doesn't work.While the cinematography is skillful, the tone is too bright and flat, leaving the feel of a TV production. The erotic scenes are tastefully dull, and the music swells through every moment with lush romanticism, punctuated by impish montages. As the story proceeds the number of scenes with the script direction ALL LAUGH increases, and the motivations of the characters fall flat. The final showdown is childishly embarrassing. No idea where they went wrong, although I suspect the director/producer is to blame.Overall: Oil is to water as fairy tale is to tragedy.",Dangerous Beauty
13,DeeNine-2,True love triumphs over the Inquisition,5,16 January 2000,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)Yes, and Santa Claus is coming to town. And there is somewhere a woman true and fair.Veronica Franco (Catherine McCormack), a woman with a venerable family name but no cash, learns the oldest profession from her mother after experiencing the considerable shock of seeing a young woman in the nunnery (her first choice since she can't marry the man she loves) getting her golden locks shorn. No danger of that for Veronica, whose mane flows free even when she might dress down a little to hide from the hoi polloi, who are blaming her sinful ways for the plague that visits 16th Century Venice.Rufus Sewell plays nobleman Marco Venier who loves her but must marry someone else for the good of the family fortune. He plays the role like a caddy to McCormack, which is the way men appear in romance novels. McCormack herself gives only a workman-like performance that cannot lift this historical romance above the usual paperback issue. (We really needed Kate Winslet, but perhaps she read the script.) The rather routine indictment of the Inquisition and soft revelations of the hypocrisy of the Venetian nobility can't disguise the fact that this is a women's fantasy-fulfillment indulgence all the way and nothing more. The movie is also political correct in the tiresome manner of the 1990's, when women must be shown as triumphing over men through the sheer power of their cleverness and superior moxie, or, put another way, through having bigger balls.Once again Hollywood celebrates the high class whore as being ahead of her time. We see her gain admiration and riches as she develops a worldly sophistication second perhaps only to that of the Pope. Yet there is some truth to this stale notion. To make it work though, we needed to see Veronica's seamy side, to experience the crudity of her lascivious and exploitive nature. Instead we have a fairy tale princess whore, Snow White turning tricks in gorgeous gowns sans syphilis, sans beatings, sans pimp. Jacqueline Bisset is competent as the mother who teaches her daughter how to exploit men. As a pep talk she tells Veronica that courtesans are the best educated women, and you are following in the footsteps of Cleopatra. I think the historical fact (if fact it is) that the only women who were allowed to read in 16th century Venice were courtesans, confused the designers of this tale into thinking that courtesans were the superior ladies of Venetian society. They were the only women allowed in the library because they were considered already corrupted. The whole movie suffers from this sort of ""gee whiz this is so eye-opening for our times"" treatment. The climactic scene before the Inquisition in particular is embarrassing in the melodramatic naiveté of its phony development. Hollywood is again attempting to re-write history in light of the current PC agenda. Alas, however, wasn't it always thus?",Dangerous Beauty
14,KUAlum26,"OK period piece,but McCormack's beauty and charm elevates it",7,19 May 2008,"I'll confess(no pun to those who've already sen the movie)that my knowledge on the subject matter that this movie culls from,particularly the novel by MArgaret Rosenthal,is somewhat slight. I saw this movie first over ten years ago in the theater powered almost entirely on the fact that it starred Catherine McCormack, an actress whom I'd become mildly curious and fascinated (maybe even enamored) with from her short but affecting role as Mel Gibson's ill-fated wife in ""Braveheart"". I decided to buy a cheap copy of the film years later and just recently re-watched the film,not only to see her again but also give this movie's whole structure a chance to impress upon me again. Re-watching had me re-appraising this film.McCormack's Veronica Franco,a 16th Century learned Courtesan is a vision as a transformation from shy,lovestruck Venetian local to bright,gifted and dutiful servicer to men's desires. Her relationship with the dashing,noble soldier-senator Marco(Rufus Sewell),may lack in anything unique but makes up for in zesty,passionate interplay. The rise and fall of Veronica is almost exactly parallel to the fortunes of her native Venice,and when plague befalls the province,the ire and holy wrath of inquisition makes her an easy target. This film is lushly,lavishly filmed and,as such,is a veritable feast for the eyes. However(and perhaps I'm telling too much about my own film prejudices and cynicism but...)the conflict of love over expediency,the message of women's place in society and the largely dark shadow that the Roman Catholic church fells upon society seem so commonplace that it makes this film seem almost pedantic and preachy. Also,the friction between Franco and Maffio Venier(Oliver Platt,who is as professional and game as ever here),Marco's cousin and resident courtier,seems somewhat forced,while the conflict between Veronica and MArco's frigid and callow wife(NAomi Watts,nearly unrecognizable!)is left woefully underdeveloped and one-note. Ditto for the friendship between the title character and her warm but non-enterprising friend Beatrice(Moira Kelly).Overall,the story and product looks and feels great,it just feels like much of the detail and credibility is sacrificed to create a movie that wants to be both inspiring AND erotic,and just able to pull that off. Director Marshall Hershkowitz does a decent job capturing all the sights and sounds to give it the rich emotional as well as visual feel for the era. McCormack's presence(and to a lesser degree Sewell's,Pratt's and Fred Ward's as the Venier's Uncle who takes a great deal of liking to VEronica)elevates this from a mere pedestrian ""bodice-ripper"" to something that has emotion and sensuality. This film further re-enforces my enjoyment of her presence in movies and my wish to see Miss McCormack in more films.A good film that wanted to be great. HAving said all that,I still find this worthy of another look(or looks).",Dangerous Beauty
15,jhclues,"Engaging Story, Excellent Performances",8,3 March 2002,"There's a consistent moral thread that runs through every society from age to age and generation to generation, the tenets of which are established within parameters, and therefore subject to change; or more specifically, subject to a change in perspective.  And that change can come very quickly-- veritably over night in some instances.  There is also another constant that defines the human condition in any era, and as we find in `Dangerous Beauty,' directed by Marshall Herskovitz, it is the fact that an individual will do whatever is necessary to survive.  It is simply an undeniable, irrefutable basic instinct of the human animal.  Moral tenets and survival, however, taken as properties are something akin to oil and water, and will mix accordingly.  Being more often than not polar opposites, conflict is inherent and will ultimately surface at some point or other, the outcome of which is determined by the strength of whichever perspective is prevalent at the moment.  And it is at such moments that we discover that life, like politics, can be a sordid, unpleasant affair; or at the other end of the spectrum, the greatest gift of all.	It's 16th Century Venice; Marco Venier (Rufus Sewell) is of a wealthy and powerful family, and is a Senator in good standing in the community.  He is also in love with Veronica Franco (Catherine McCormack), who though intelligent and beautiful, is beneath Marco's station in society, and they are, therefore, forbidden to marry.  Instead, Marco's father, Pietro (Jeroen Krabbe), has arranged a marriage for his son, an alliance that will be to the substantial benefit of both families.  Veronica's family, meanwhile, due to prevailing circumstances must look to Veronica for support, so her mother, Paola (Jacqueline Bisset), not only arranges for Veronica to become a courtesan, but instructs her herself in the fine art of seduction and the kind of pleasures that will put the most coins in the coffers, as well as how to survive by being in love with `love.'  	For Veronica, it soon becomes a lucrative, if not fulfilling enterprise, but there are clouds forming on the horizon, the least of which involves an impending war with the Turks, a war they cannot win without the help of King Henry (Jake Weber) of France.  Very quickly, life in Venice changes; Marco is off to war, and the formerly open acceptance of the courtesans undergoes a swift and drastic reversal of perspective among a seeming majority of those within the city.  And once again Veronica's life is in flux; and she is about to find out that it will never be the same again.	Nicely presented and beautifully filmed (the cinematography by Bojan Bazelli is exquisite), Herskovitz's film-- which is based on a true story and adapted from Margaret Rosenthal's novel by screenwriter Jeannine Dominy-- succinctly points up the moral hypocrisy that has always existed within any given culture or society, and which will continue to exist so long as there are social institutions and structures to support them.  And the possible consequences of such diverse perspectives and attitudes, when zealously pursued, are effectively personified in the character of Maffio Venier (Oliver Platt), in whom we find the ultimate manifestation of moral decay, masked by platitudes of self-serving righteousness.  Herskovitz also effectively uses the relationship between Veronica and Maffio-- initially a mutually agreeable rivalry; a contest of words which later turns aggressively ugly-- as a reflection of how readily one facet of society will turn on another if but afforded the appropriate circumstances.  It's a film that works well on a number of levels, as on one hand it's a love story, while on the other it's an insightful dissertation on the inherent imperfections of society, and the fragile moral fiber that holds it together.	In the title role, McCormack gives a solid performance; that Veronica is beautiful is obvious, but most importantly, McCormack conveys her intelligence, as well, and it makes her character three-dimensional and quite convincing.  Interestingly enough, Veronica is a sympathetic character for whom, nevertheless, you do not necessarily feel sorry; and perhaps it's because she carries herself so well and has such a strong sense of `victory' about her, hiding any vulnerability that would make her susceptible to pity. This is a woman who takes the detritus life throws at her and makes something of it-- and she does it with dignity.  If her life is morally compromised, it is not due to any acquiescence on her part, but rather the need and the will to survive.  This is a complex character who has to tread a number of fine lines, and McCormack plays it beautifully and believably.	As Marco, Sewell hits his stride and turns in an excellent performance, as well.  Marco is something of a pivotal character, in that Veronica's response to him and their relationship becomes the most telling expression of the effects of the courtesan life on her.  And as the story unfolds, Sewell does a nice job of developing his character, finally achieving a depth of emotion that significantly heightens the impact of the climax. 
	In supporting roles, both Platt and Bisset give notable performances, too. Platt once again demonstrates that he is one of the best character actors in the business; and not only is Bisset exemplary in the role of Paola, but the casting of her and McCormack as mother/daughter was inspired.	The supporting cast includes Moira Kelly (Beatrice), Naomi Watts (Guila), Fred Ward (Domenico), Joanna Cassidy (Laura), Peter Eyre (The Doge), Justine Miceli (Elena), Carla Cassola (Caterina), Michael Culkin (The Bishop) and Charlotte Randle (Francesca).  As Michael Corleone said at one point, `We're all a part of the same hypocrisy;' and if there's a lesson to be learned from `Dangerous Beauty,' it's that one should not deign to pass judgment on another without first walking in that person's shoes.  It also reminds us of the necessity of maintaining a proper perspective-- and keeping in mind that what's acceptable today may not be acceptable tomorrow.  8/10.",Dangerous Beauty

Catherine McCormack in this movie is truly every man's wildest fantasy... she can recite poetry, swordfight, is bookish smart... Oh, and she's pretty good between the sheets too. Of course her major drawback is she's a courtesan (A sort of high class prostitute) so I'd have to share her with around 100 other men. But never mind... I'm sure we could reach some kind of arrangement. Come to me, my pretty. I hope you like cats and Wispa bars.Set in the 16th century in a very decadent Venice, it tell of the rise and decline of the beautiful city, where unbridled pleasure was interrupted by war and the eventual arrival of religious fanatics, which saw all harlots guilty of witchcraft. It wasn't the best period to be a female, as your sole purpose seemed to be either a breeding machine or a household slave. But those beautiful enough had another option: Service the rich and powerful in their every sordid desire, and you got inundated with gifts and invited to lots of lavish parties as well as living like a queen. That is, until your looks faded...This had me involved from the start, helped no doubt by the gorgeous heroine but also by the host of other delightful characters, including Rufus Sewell as her unattainable true love from a higher station, and Oliver Platt as his cousin, who moves to the God Squad after a bit of brainwashing. The reenactment of 1500's Italy seems spot on (not that I claim to be an expert) and the tale told is both amusing and absorbing.

It shows how the ideals of the Renaissance were taken further in Venice than any other city. It manages to get us back into the time period better than any other movie I have ever seen.The acting, sets, lighting, make-up and costumes are superb and the story enchanting.

Admittedly, I saw this film on TV last night and I enjoyed everything about the film besides the musical background.I thought, as did other commentators, that the historical epic blossomed fully, the costumes, the physical settings and the sprinkling of real historical figures: how many films are produced with the personage of the Venetian Doge sitting amongst his Senators and other governmental officials. Given contemporary schooling, this could easily be the last generation for decades that would ever know about Venetian Doges or about the Ottoman attack on Malta and its importance to European history or what the Inquisition was all about.The film was a delicious compendium of choice morsels of historical dishes that allowed the viewer to leave the TV table well satisfied.",Dangerous Beauty

The Franco family have come on hard times since the man (who we don't meet) has wasted the family fortunes. Paola (Jacqueline Bissett) tells her daughter Veronica (Catherine McCormack) that she will become a courtesan, as she had been once. And so begins the education that Veronica will later assert is a women's most prized asset, - deportment, clothes, table manners, bedroom manners, the classics, poetry, verbal jousting, horse riding and then an amazing lesson in male anatomy!The rulers, senators and aristocracy seem to marry just for the power networking, but get their jollies at exotic parties and when Veronica blushingly says that this is her first... the handsome Minister Ramberti gives her even more gold. Soon, in return for taking off some clothes she is given even more clothes, jewelery, information and of course, gold.But it is Marco Venier (Rufus Sewell) that Veronica loves. Alas, they cannot marry, but at least the family is saved, but then a plague-like sickness comes and some religious cranks blame this on the dissolute behaviour.

21,TheAnimalMother,"Good Story, Pretty Flat Delivery",4,9 March 2014,"I'm somewhat surprised to see this film rated so highly after watching it. I shall warn you that the film is neither as sexy as it may seem, nor is it nearly as well told as some may lead you to believe. The story here is definitely an interesting one, and even a fairly important one; However the execution leaves a lot to be desired.The film claims to be a true story, which much of it likely is, but it is not told in an authentic way whatsoever, and that is my biggest dislike of the film. Few of the scenes seem like they are something that would have gone down quite the way the film tells us they did. It's just too far from reality. I'm not totally against films being unreal, or fantastical; But to me it just doesn't work well when you claim that you are telling a true story, but then most of the film is filled with scenes that don't really feel like they are portraying real characters and situations. This film feels more like a cartoon version of Venice circa the late 1500's, early 1600's. Nothing really fits quite right in this film despite the good story, and even at times despite some good dialogue. There are better versions of Fanny Hill out there that are comparable to this, and certainly more believable.I'm sure this is one of those rare cases of where a film about a prostitute is actually more appealing to women, then to men. Like another well known film of this sort, Pretty Woman, the film mixes prostitution with romance, which to me is not a problem at all if it's pulled off well. Unfortunately it just isn't pulled off that well in this case. Pretty Woman is easily a better film in my view, at least it has some good laughs and some fun and engaging characters, which this film for the most part does not.My rating 4.5/10",Dangerous Beauty
22,chiaragiacobelli,The amazing story of Veronica Franco,9,14 January 2019,"This is one of my favourite movie, based on the novel ""The honest courtesan"" and inspired by the most famous venetian courtesan of ever: Veronica Franco.
Although the movie doesn't follow perfectly the reality, it is a very good product in which love, history, past and intrigues are well mixed.
The protagonist is wonderful, so beautiful and smart... Venice always the best location for a movie!",Dangerous Beauty
23,MRavenwood,Beautiful Danger,9,15 March 2008,"First it should be noted that the film Dangerous Beauty is based on true events and the life of a real person. Certainly liberties have been taken, but it is a rich and romantic tale of deeply loyal love.This is a beautiful period piece set in Venice 1600s, which was Republic on its own, not a part of Italy. This major shipping port was home to Marco Polo and a transport nexus of luxury goods such as silk and spices. The film manages to capture the wealthy excess of the city as well as exposing the gritty underclass. As fabulous as the costumes are and as exciting most of the actors, it has to be conceded that there is a tone of ""girl teen empowerment movie"" in more than one scene.The times dictated that women had to be worth something -to hold a dowry - in order to be married to a man of status or means. If you had no money, you were going to be a maid of some sort or marry whomever would have you. But it was acceptable, even a sign of status, at the time for men to take paid lovers. This occupation of refined prostitute was in a gray area of society, simultaneously approved of and unapproved. The film explores this gray area of power and social standing on the one hand and social scorn on the other. In one particular poignant comment, Veronica, the protagonist helps the audience wonder if the men are not the same as she, as they often marry for money and without love.The resolution is very Hollywood and a dramatic payoff worth seeing. My only caveat would be that this film makes being an educated and well-dressed prostitute seem admirable and like an acceptable career goal for young women. A dangerous message, especially when recent news touts hookers making five grand a night.",Dangerous Beauty

I think the reason I liked this so much was because of the commentary about the restrictions, the limited and the difficult choices the women of sixteenth century Venice. The fact that it is based on the life of a real person makes it all the better.",Dangerous Beauty
27,DonB-5,Superb,8,25 October 1998,I saw this when it first came out and I just saw it again on video.  Superb movie.  I adore Venice and feel I got a real taste of what it must have been like in the 16th century.  Great photography and costumes.  Beautiful actors.  Comedy.  Romance.  Based on a true story.  Shows some of the ugliness of the zealot church of the time.  A must see and one of the year's best.  Where were the critics on this one?  Played to empty theaters mostly. What a shame.,Dangerous Beauty
28,xenophil,"Sugary, bland, and sanctimonious",5,26 April 2002,"For a movie about a courtesan, this show was amazingly unsexy.  The lead actress is very pretty, in a wispy blond sort of way, but has no trace of the kind of charisma you would expect she would need to be the leading courtesan of her day, one who could talk her way out of the Inquisition.   For most of the film, there's no conflict to speak of - every sinister turn of the plot has its teeth pulled.  Prostitution is made to look like a tourist magazine version of a luxury honeymoon.  The Inquisition are a bunch of stuffed scarecrows.The lavish costumes and sets convey hardly any feeling of Renaissance Venice.  The actors all have a modern, American air in their look and manner.  Only Rufous Sewell looks the least bit Italian.  The French king looks and acts ridiculously British.   We are trotted through turn after turn of the plot with no effort to convince us that any of it is real.Each scene seems borrowed from a different costume drama, and all the characters' motivations, too.  The final insult was the heresy trial. The weakest sibling yet of all movie heresy trials!  I suppose this is a feminist parable, but I think any credit you gain by proposing that a prostitute is a heroine of liberty, you lose by being as santimonious about it as the priests that retire in defeat at the end.I guess I like movies with more grit.",Dangerous Beauty
29,elwinter,A historic romance featuring poetry bouts,8,20 October 2002,"Romances typically rely on obstacles to provide dramatic tension.  In this case, it's the time-honored obstacles of money and politics.  Our hero can't marry our heroine because of the prominence of his family.  Our heroine, due to her family's dire financial straits becomes a courtesan.  Thereafter, she sleeps with everyone but him, at least for awhile.  She also distinguishes herself in public poetry bouts, and saves Renaissance Venice by seducing the King of France so he provides reinforcements for a war against the Turks. Also features the plague, a trial for witchcraft, jealous wives, an envious cousin, and more.  Well crafted, and worth seeing.  Based, loosely, on actual historical events and characters.  Decent performances turned in by a talented cast.",Dangerous Beauty
30,Nick-290,Pleasant movie on courtesans in Renaissance Venice,9,4 November 2002,"This movie shows the live of women in the Renaissance in Venice. Married women were treated as property and locked away by their husbands. They were kept ignorant, had only their religion for comfort, and their main responsibility was to reproduce and deliver heirs for the future of the dynasty.Against this dull and depressing world stands the world of the courtesans. Beautiful, educated women, similar to those in ancient Greece, socialise with the men of wealth and power, sing and dance for them, recite poetry, and of course fulfil their sexual desires. As reward they are respected, wealthy, enjoy education and personal freedom and engage in politics. However, they must forsake marriage and a respectable family life.The story concentrates on one woman, who chooses the life of a courtesan, since her family is to poor to provide the dowry for the marriage to the love of her life, a young Venetian senator, who loves her back with the same desperate intensity. As a courtesan, she becomes very influential in the upper circles of Venice, mingles with the clergy, with politicians and generals, becomes a famous poetess, publishes her work as books. Finally, at a crucial point in the history of Venice, it is she who persuades the French king to help out with his fleet in a naval struggle against the Turks.Alas, as always, things turn sour, when the plague comes to Venice, thousands die, and the people are looking for a scapegoat. The holy inquisition is summoned, and the courtesans play the role of the Christians in the Rome under Nero. In a show trial, our heroine is accused of witchcraft, and has to face the wrath of Catholicism against educated women, and the hatred and jealousy of the pious wives of Venice.",Dangerous Beauty
31,Puregold,"Beauty can get you everything, or lose it all.",8,28 November 1998,"Dangerous Beauty is a film of contrast. It begins with the often funny, and simple story of a woman in love. Sadly her lover is from a rich family, and ordered to marry because of status, and not because of love, leaving this beautiful woman heartbroken. To become a person of status herself, and make money doing so, her mother teaches her to become a courtesan, a sort of well respected, high class, prostitute. She becomes so good at what she does that she can court kings and bishops as well as the common man. Life is wonderful for this beautiful woman. She learns to live with the hatred cast upon her from the other women of the town, and makes a nice fortune doing what she does best. She is beautiful, but also intelligent, and her mind is what makes her the best. While other women can compete with her beauty or her prowess, none can compete with her mind.The movie takes a turn as the plague comes to Venice, and the high class call girl is reduced to a common whore, and charged with witchcraft, casting her spell on all the men of the town. The question then becomes can her intelligence help her escape from persecution that her body got her into?This is an intelligently written, and beautifully filmed movie that has a lot of laughs and a lot of love.",Dangerous Beauty
32,eunice-4,Another chance to see Rufus Sewell,8,25 July 1999,"Rufus Sewell must be one of Britain's busiest actors and popular romantic lead.  He must have appeared in some 10 films this year and the year is only half way through. Rufus is a throwback to the glory days of Gainsborough pictures when James Mason, Stewart Grainger, Michael Rennie et al caused hearts to throb in period dramas as they swirled their capes, drew their swords, fought duels, bedded wenches and in general acted like lusty MEN! Rufus Sewell saves this film from being a feminist sounding board by playing a young lover forced into an arranged marriage by the custom of the times without appearing weak and sappy. The medieaval Italians spent their time wheeling and dealing in a way that would put a Hollywood mogul to shame, and arranging marriages was part of the dealing.Catherine McCormick does a wonderful job as Veronica and the film is helped by wonderful supporting players.  I must confess that I felt sorry for the abandoned wife of Marco.For my taste, the feminist revision of history is grating.  People in those times knew the score:  no one married for love and no one expected to. Veronica, being from a good, albeit impoverished, family could have married a noveau riche merchant wanting to move up by marrying into an old respected family. She became a courtesan by choice, it was in her blood, and had she not stuck her neck out and antagonised the church she would not have been hauled before the Inquisition.The film looks handsome and is worth watching twice.  I just wish I could have seen it on a cinema screen, but as there were no car chases, no teenagers, and it did not star Bruce, Arnold, or Sylvester, it was not shown in my area.",Dangerous Beauty
33,jjgoard,Humorously Lame,2,21 March 2003,"I couldn't tell whether the intended focus of ""Dangerous Beauty"" was on the romantic comedy or the social commentary, but in both respects it's so embarrassingly heavy-handed that you might have a great deal of fun laughing *at* it.  The ""wit""ty exchanges are Wildean in delivery but Hughesian in content.  What could be better than an anachronistic paean to Hollywood values, complete with slow-clap?

34,orcagurl,"Entertaining, but bad",6,13 May 2006,"Yes, an entertaining film, yes beautiful on a cinematic aspect, but all in all, a silly period piece, and considering the subject matter, it would have done better if held with more sensitivity than sentimentality.It's not a smart period piece, let's start with that. The 'jovial' verbal sparring that goes on between Veronica and Platt's character is trite, and with clumsy innuendos. The sexual fascinations the men of Venice have with Veronica comes off as somewhat artificial, and Veronica herself, doesn't seem like such a dangerous beauty. The emphasis for power and intelligence in courtesans is quite clear in the film, but apart from showing her reading a couple of books, this doesn't come across. The exchange between Veronica and King Henry was set up to be challenging, and interesting, and then too easily resolved. The conclusion between Marco and Veronica's characters ripped right out of a Harlequin romance, and not given any sort of punch to make it favorable. I was hoping that Veronica would truly be strong, and assert herself as a powerful woman, but her weaknesses and what she gave into demeans this. And Paola, her mother, was quite shocking and somewhat incredulous. The film tries to explain her motives for pushing Veronica to become a courtesan, but the training session sequence still leaves an uneasy feeling about her.I sound quite unforgiving towards the film, so here I admit there were some good moments. Veronica explaining the not so glamorous part of a courtesan's life. The court scene (though the conclusion was still a mite too easy) held some power the rest of the film should have. Veronica's interactions with Domenic. And the Minister Rimbarti was a very sympathetic character and he stood out in the scenes he was in.So all in all, it's okay to watch, but if you're expecting something that actually has meaning look somewhere else.",Dangerous Beauty
35,bela_bombastic,Terribly sentimental and uninteresting,2,3 September 2008,"Before watching the movie, I decided to watch it based on the title and the subject matter. I thought that this movie would have something to do with sex and lust and perhaps even depravity. I was completely annoyed that this turned out to be a cheesy romantic comedy along the lines of any Meg Ryan or Julia Roberts movie, but perhaps even more annoying because it is so deceptive.I was hoping for a movie like Quills--a look into the lives of historic figures who were indulging in things that were looked down upon in those strict times. I thought it was boring and bland and ridiculous. The poetry duels were perhaps the lamest parts, because the poetry they came up with was stupid. The courtesan's relationship with Oliver Platt's character was absolutely ridiculous; why does he dislike her and what the hell is the point in showing this anyway? Oh, and the music! I don't think there was one moment where there was no cheesy music playing to compliment the cheesy dialogue and plot.

(Kind of like poor ole Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman--she had to be saved by the oh so handsome Richard Gere. Please! Spare me!I think it has something to do with the Puritanical views that still are upheld in our country.... God forgive anyone who sins in the name a' da' lord!

Dangerous Beauty in the US - fairly crass! A Destiny of her own in Aus - Too feminist, arty? The Honest Courtesan in Europe - The original title, better but too many people have trouble with 'Courtesan' in the title! I am sure the film will have more success on video, but with the wonderful 'Scope cinematography, the film is ravishingly beautiful on the Cinema screen.

Margaret F Rosenthal wrote about her in ""The Honest Courtesan"".The acting is superb...the period costuming is fantastic. As is the scenery. This is a must see on many levels.The courtesans in this era were intelligent, witty, and refined. Married woman of the time (the wealthy ones) were confined to a very dull life while their husbands entertained themselves with well educated courtesans. The courtesans were the only women allowed in the libraries of the day. As much as I love books...there is no doubt in my mind as to what role I would have chose! lol The movie revolves around those of wealth. The poor women of the day are in terrible straits...I'm glad this era is over.Seriously, this is a wonderful movie visually. And, it is spiced with some interesting bits of history.It is not one to take your kids to which usually causes me to deduct points.

Being unacquainted with 1500s Venice, I watched the movie without judging, until I got to the end. This end showed me the real nature of the film, for it was so irritatingly a banal unrealistic ""American"" happy-ending.British Catherine McCormack sure is beautiful and talented, and British Rufus Sewell is no worse then her, but this is a movie I will give them bad credit for doing. Their talent and beauty and the gorgeous costumes and locations are not a good enough reason to watch this ridiculously-ploted movie.I would have given some thought to the feminist massage, but I found this movie to be so pretentious in other areas, that this is set aside.",Dangerous Beauty

Some surprising actors turn out beautifully.Only bad thing is, I hate this about movies and books; doesn't it get a little old when the lead female makes EVERY man fall in love or lust with her?

The fact that this movie is based loosely on an amazing real life woman makes this movie even more wonderful.  Catherine McCormack plays Veronica as such a strong, independance yet fragile woman.  Her intelligence and passion are so evident in her every word.  Rufus Sewell is wonderful as Marco.  You can see his love and the torture at not being able to openly love the woman he loves on his face.  And how can anyone not love Jacqueline Bisset's role which she plays with such honesty.  I don't think there has been a time when I have watched this movie and it hasn't moved me to tears.

Some of the dialog is borrowed from real historical manuscripts, and the poetry is worth re-winding to hear again. But, somehow it just doesn't add up. This film carries it's message on it's sleeve, and it's not quite in synch with the period. While boldly promoting a feminist perspective, the film comes off more as soft core porn.

Period romances make great movies, and this is one of the best I've seen yet.  Particularly because most of it is true, except of course for a few artistic bits here and there. The plot sucks you in, and moves along at a smooth pace.  At no point did I ever find myself really getting bored with what was going on.  Veronica is really a character that can make people (especially girls) stop and think. It can make your head spin to realize that women may have been put in similar positions many times in that time period.  Catherine McCormack does a good job in the lead.  For me though, the entire cast was overshadowed by Rufus Sewell.  I've always been a fan of his, and this is definitely his best movie yet.  He's a talented actor who puts a lot of passion into this part, plus he's not hard to look at.  Besides that, the costumes and sets are really beautiful.  But the love story is the best part of all.

From sword fights, war, and gratuitous breasts for the guys to romance, medieval dresses, and Venice for the ladies.  If you don't think, you'll see a story of an independent woman and of how Love Conquers All.But if you try to think about what is going on and if you try to consider what the characters are saying and doing, all you'll be able to do is tilt your head, squint, and ask yourself, ""Huh?""  It's not that the movie is confusing; there has to be at least an attempt at complexity for that. It's that the characters act in such a senseless way that there's no way to imagine any real person doing what they do (in spite of the scene-setting opening paragraph that tells us that this REALLY DID HAPPEN).The baseline is that Dangerous Beauty tries really hard to be a good drama about defying society, convention, and women's gender roles.  Problem is that it turns out being a bad melodrama about following society's rules and staying behind a man.  Dangerous Beauty got a 2.

55,MissLeFey,Let's get some facts straight...(some spoilers),10,5 January 2004,"The main character of the film is named Veronica Franco. I'm not sure what movie the other person was watching that they thought her name was Katherine. The actress' name is Catherine McCormack though. Anyway, Veronica Franco was a 16th century Venetian courtesan and a published poet. That was quite a feat in her day considering society thought (and still does today to some extent) that the role of women were to be wives and mothers and nothing more. They did not receive education outside of the Bible.
Courtesans were an exception. Because they were companions of educated men, whether in Venice or not, they had to be educated as well. Courtesans always had a field in which they excelled outside of sex, be it philosophy, literature, history, etc. Before I saw this movie, I had the same ignorant assumption that courtesans were just higher priced streetwalkers, but they weren't. These women were brazen and they had to be to do what they did for a living. They dared to enjoy sex in a time when women weren't supposed to and spoke out when women were supposed to be silent.After seeing Dangerous Beauty, I decided to look up Veronica Franco and the histories of courtesans in general. I would ask that everyone do that instead of going on ill-informed and prejudiced views. The movie does leave out a great deal about Veronica's life, but it's a fair summary. Scenery is gorgeous as is the costuming. The acting is wonderful. What is unfortunate, if you look closely at society and consider how you react to things of a sexual nature, not much has changed from those times.",Dangerous Beauty
56,anne-miller929,"Underrated, beautiful movie",9,4 January 2014,"I saw this movie in the theater on a girl's night and I now own it on DVD. I think this movie suffers from a rather silly title and could have made Catherine McCormack a star if it had been more widely seen. Ms. McCormack seems to be molded from the same line of icy blond beauties that produced Gwyneth Paltrow and Cate Blanchett. I think Ms. McCormack has the edge in looks, acting ability, and on screen passion. It doesn't seem fair that the former are mega stars and no one seems to know Catherine McCormack. Se was also excellent in A Sound of Thunder - another of my favorite movies.The movie itself features a number of my favorite actors and it is beautifully filmed. The Italian Renaissance costumes are exquisite, particularly the apricot/peach dress she wears on her first night as a courtesan. I want that dress and I want that life! The relationship with Marco is okay, nothing that hasn't been done a thousand times. It's the scenes of her mother teaching her to be a courtesan, the scenes of her learning her way among men, the poetry battles, her charming nervous fumbling on her first night with a man, her exquisite verbal fluency and ability to hold her own in a male-dominated world that really captured my attention.This is a beautiful historical romance/drama with quality in every aspect - the music, the costuming, the sets, the cinematography. The acting is first rate across the board. Everyone turns in an outstanding performance. The fact that the movie is based on historical fact is simply a bonus. I think every woman longs to be Veronica Franco at some point.",Dangerous Beauty
57,SandyDee-2,"Absolutely wonderful, romantic movie",10,3 November 1999,"I loved this movie.  Beautifully done, sets were magnificent.  I don't understand why this didn't get the attention it deserved.  The cover of the video box doesn't really tell much about what it is, but it is one of the best historical romance movies I've ever seen.  Catherine McCormack was beautiful (as she was in Braveheart) and Oliver Platt showed us his best role ever.  I will definitely watch this one again.",Dangerous Beauty
58,zader,Makes you think as well as feel,10,8 October 1998,"This is one of the few movies in 1998 with a theme strong enough to capture my unqualified respect.  Catherine McCormack's inspirational character chooses a life of independence and integrity as -- don't snicker -- a sixteenth-century courtesan.  Her on-screen chemistry with Rufus Sewell is staggering, and the two play wonderful counterpoint throughout the movie, learning to overcome the limitations imposed by society and live out their love for one another.",Dangerous Beauty
59,jeff-122,Honest Mills and Boon,7,4 January 2001,"Sumptious photography, cracking story, beautiful lead actress and a superb courtroom denouement still can't shake the feeling that this is as fake as a plastic Christmas tree.It was very enjoyable if viewed as fluff, 16th century ""Dynasty"" occured to me at several points, but the most amazing thing about this story is that most of the key events actually happened.Everyone speaking in English accents and high-school poetry portrayed as great wit and art killed the credibility. I can't believe this story took 500 years to reach the screen ( well 100 technically). Where is the Italian language version without the wish fulfillment?  (Perfect teeth and grooming, no sexual diseases, those mawkish riding horse-back montage sequences) Admittedly this is a romance and they aren't known for their realism but this could have been a great work of art, not just a pretty picture.Still, worth viewing. It certainly does get better as it goes along.",Dangerous Beauty

I wish more people would see it, particularly teenagers, as this movie does have important historical (current?) themes, re the Church, women's historical subservient status, and the need to place blame (for the Black Death) somewhere, and who better than the successful courtesans. This movie has a purpose, without smacking you over the head with it. It's also lusciously beautiful.",Dangerous Beauty

The story of the courtesans of Venice was one that I wasn't familiar with, but I think it is a fascinating one. Also it should make us think what women had to do at that time in order to have liberty and to obtain some education.I strongly recommend this movie to all the friends of historical movies and also supporters of romantic films.",Dangerous Beauty
62,Aleatha,An excellent adaptation of a scholarly work,10,22 April 1999,"For me the power of this movie rests in its faithfulness to Margaret Rosenthal's book the Honest Courtesan; which is a well-researched look at Veronica Franco's life and the plight of Venetian women in the 16th century. Dangerous Beauty, while making certain assumptions and taking some literary license, was a talented translation of Rosenthal's careful research into a captivating film. Many of the witty remarks and social commentary come directly from 16th century documents. Surprisingly the most unbelievable aspect of the movie (her escape from the Inquisition and support from prominent Venetian nobles) is historical fact. While the details are unknown and the movie is certainly more romatically dramatic than I would imagine the actual historical event, it was very true to the spirit and feel supported by the evidence we have.Venetian women, and indeed most medieval women, were in an unenviable position as second class citizens. Veronica Franco's struggle to find an acceptable position in society as a woman of good family but poor, is representative of the moral and societal conflicts of her time. Courtesans were not respected but they were accepted as a necessary evil. Their income was even taxable! In a society where female chastity was considered sacrosanct if she were to marry and a marriage bed was no less for sale than a courtesan's, women's choices were limited indeed. Franco's impassioned cry in the movie ""I did what was necessary to survive!"" is no less true were it not a verbatim report of her defense. As a penniless girl her options were limited to scullery work, the nunnery or prostitution. Her distinction was that, while she chose to sell her body, she never chose to be dominated by her profession or those who sought her out. In publishing her book of poetry and personal letters, she redefined herself as a woman first and a courtesan second. Using her wit to defend herself in the public arena she skillfully manipulated accepted literary mores of the day to show her mastery of the literary as well as political implications of her position.Her greatest detractors were courtiers, such as Maffio Venier, who competed with courtesans for the money bestowed by wealthy patrons. As she says in the movie, they must both sing for their suppers. The problem is that while she is willing to accept they are equal in their need of patronage, he is unwilling to be outdone by a woman. His misogynistic works of poetry were directed toward Franco and other courtesans with the intent of parading his own virtue by damning theirs. The greatest irony is that Maffio was ultimately killed by a sexual disease while Franco died of causes unrelated to her sexual practices.While there are those who might see this movie as an acceptance of prostitution, I believe they are missing the true story behind the sexual facade which they are focusing on. Franco's life was one of courage and honesty. She made choices that we may not understand, but we do not live in her world. And she accepted both the privilege and the degradation that her position brought her. This movie is a powerful tribute to one who sought more in life than mere existence and who faced her trials with the courage of her convictions, whether or not we or others share those convictions is immaterial.",Dangerous Beauty
63,tjk2,"Interesting story, poorly written",6,9 July 2005,"The underlying story in this film is a fascinating one that deserves serious treatment. Unfortunately, the screen writing does not do justice to the material. For one thing, the character of Veronica Franco does not appear to have many qualms about her choice to become a courtesan throughout the course of the film, where one would expect that in that era, it would be a very difficult and humiliating choice for a woman to make. While the positive aspects of being a courtesan are justly portrayed, the negative aspects are glossed over or neglected. Another serious problem is the lack of a negative response to this choice on the part of close friends as well the man who loves her. There are occasional moments when the social ostracism she would have been treated to in real life at the time are shown, but initially there does not appear to be any negative social consequences to this choice, and indeed even the man who loves her doesn't seem to care what she has become. The film ought to have more seriously and honestly explored his reaction to her choice, as well as her own. It would have made it a far more dramatic, and more relevant film. As it is, the film is far too lighthearted for the serious nature of the subject matter. The screenwriters failed to take full advantage of the depth of the inherent drama to the story, and instead made it almost a comedy. It does have some redeeming qualities. The film is beautifully shot, the costumes are excellent, and it's nicely paced. It isn't badly directed, but again, I feel that a more serious handling by the director could have made up for the deficiencies in the script.In summary, this is a light entertainment movie that doesn't do justice to the weight of the underlying subject matter.",Dangerous Beauty
64,shsuqueen,Beautiful tale of love,10,26 April 2003,"Dangerous Beauty is a tale of passion, duty, lust, kindness, and love. Veronica Franco becomes a courtesan to be able to have the one man she wants, but can't have, Marco.  In becoming a courtesan, she learns the ways of men, what pleasures them.  In doing so, she becomes the best courtesan in Venice.  However, love quickly takes hold of her when she can no longer keep Marco away.  Then, when the men are called off to fight the Turks, the plague settles in Venice.  The courtesans are blamed, and Veronica is taken into custody.  In loving one man, but doing what she could to help her family survive, Veronica shows courage, passion, bravery as she faces the church under the charges of witch craft. It is a fabulous movie and I highly recommend it to anyone.",Dangerous Beauty
65,AnOKMovieNut,"Wonderful movie, with slight historic discrepancies",9,31 March 2005,"This movie is beautifully filmed and artfully portrayed by all of the actors involved. Catherine McCormack and Rufus Sewell are absorbing as the two citizens of Venice tied by love, but separated by their class. Oliver Platt, Jacqueline Bisset, and Fred Ward shine in their supportive roles and give credence to a lovely, romantic story.The only drawback that I can see has nothing to do with the movie, and everything to do with historic fact. After watching the movie I found myself curious about the life of Veronica Franco, because she is portrayed so strongly by Catherine McCormack. I found that Franco was indeed interrogated by the Inquisition, not only once but twice. Also, she faced the council alone, with only her wits to save her. After watching the movie a second time, I feel that even with the strong performance this movie might not have done justice to such an amazing woman like Veronica Franco.Even so, I rate it very highly and would encourage any adult to watch it. There are some nude scenes, with sexual acts performed, so this is definitely not a movie for children. However, the love story is touching and the history behind the story is fascinating.",Dangerous Beauty

Speaking of Cath McC , this was obviously her movie and boy did she deliver. Her best performance even better than Murron. A little surprised no Oscar noms from this.
The flaw. How can you have Naomi Watts in a movie and give her only 4 lines??? Sure this was early in her career, but what a waste of talent. Imagine the scene she could have had against with ONLY McCormack in the room with the hate, angst, anger, then understanding they had for each other.

And the piece de resistance of Dangerous Beauty is the most passionate music in the world by George Fenton(this should win him his long-awaited Oscar.)The movie blends comedy, romance, swordfights, poetry, sex, the plague/Inquisition, and self-sacrifice.It makes you long for such ""a soulmate love"" as this. (That's why I saw ""D.B."" 33 times in the theater! Yes,I did! It was MY ""Titanic / Gone with the Wind / Casablanca"".) The director, Marshall Herskovitz,(of Legends Of the Fall) created a world that I loved to visit.The movie reminded me that I was still a ""Dangerous Beauty"" myself.

Profound and thoughtful it ain't. On the other hand what we have is a glossy, colourful and mildly entertaining retelling of a supposedly true story. Catherine McCormack plays the courtesan (a high-class prostitute) who falls for Venice's Prince Marco (Rufus Sewell). Unfortunately for them the good prince must marry according to his station so their love cannot be consummated. The courtesan instead beds all the important men in the Republic and during pillow-talk demonstrates her knowledge of all and sundry; during one riveting conversation with a general she asserts, in a dumb blonde tone, ""So, the Turks are on the move again!"" The 'tense' finale involves the arrival of the plague and the Inquisition, the latter blaming the moral decline of Venice, and specifically our dear courtesan, for the former.

77,aletnes,This isn't a movie...... its an experience,10,5 August 1999,"From lush settings, to extravagant, and at times very racy costumes... From true love to politics.... From poetry to the Inquisition... this movie has it all! Veronica Franco is precisely what every woman should try to be: alive. She lives her life to the fullest and as she says ""I regret I had no other choice, I do not regret my life."" Yes she was a courtesan, yes she sold her body nightly, but she would not let the Catholic Church take away her soul by confessing to witchcraft. During one conversation, late in the movie, between her and a rich friend who stayed within the conventions of the society, the desperation of each woman is highlighted and set against each other. The friend speaks of how ""no biblical hell could be worse"" than the eternal inconsequence of a Venetian noblewoman. Veronica then shows her the place where courtesans ""come to die"" ... full of drunken men and beaten women. As she puts it ""my cage may seem larger than yours, but it is still a cage""But do not think this movie is all about the plight of women in Renaissance Venice..... it is also a movie full of double entendres, most skillfully ""dueled"" by Veronica and a fellow (male) poet.

I confess that I liked the hanky scenes (the ones toward the end), but equally important were the lines, the presentation, and the acting. Some of the more subtle features that kept its audience captivated was probably the pacing, the dialogue, the character interaction, and the fact that McCormack played a likeable character who makes us care about her every step of the way.There were several great scenes in this movie, including the part when the mother teaches the daughter, the verbal spars, etcWe forget that Dangerous Beauty was released when Titanic still had legs.

Victoria Franco aspires to make use of her talents, as a charming, witty woman, who surprises men of learning with her quick replies to their weighted jests.  The conflict in the film is her love for a man she can never have, as his father forbids him to marry her.  The scenery is a visual feast, and the dialogue filled with ideas that stir the mind.

The music is also very good, I believe by George Fenton, and suits and supports the music and is worth the listen all on its own.Even my husband loves to watch this movie with me, and its one of our well beloved date movies, sensual, moving, yet ultimately triumphant.

Social commentary and cultural insights: religion, superstition, ideas about health/medicine, the influence of power and politics and sex, access to education, freedom of the individual and freedom of the mind. Romance - wonderfully healthy, sensual, erotic without being pornographic - a lesson maybe on what love should be as opposed to most of the things that pass for love in current culture. Incredible quotes and one-liners ( ... ""the living hell of being condemned to a life of perpetual insignificance"" says Veronica's friend, now safely married but shut away as she asks Veronica to teach her daughter the skills needed to become a courtesan). The brain candy when Veronica and the slovenly court poet get into verbal dueling. I will never tire of those scenes. And the costumes - had to go back and see it once again just for the detail and fabric and lush sensuality of the garb. And in the end, it is simply a morality tale.

I have just allowed my 14 yr.old daughters to watch it, since there are some sexual scenes that may not be appropriate for young viewers but there are a lot worse movies out there, done in less tasteful ways... this movie has touched my heart and will always remain my favorite. I suggest anyone who has an ounce of romance in them to watch it... ;) I have read other reviews and I will only say that those who are looking into this through the eyes of 'today' will only miss the true meaning of the movie... Courtesan's had to do what they did to survive, those without family bloodlines were denied most...

It delves deep into the politics of the era with a seriousness that doesn't come off completely overwhelming. Amidst the serious politics is the witty and comic banter of the characters to keep it somewhat light-hearted.Veronica Franco (Catherine McCormack) is in love with Marco Venier (Rufus Sewell) but they are forbidden to marry as she is of a lower social status. Veronica is left with two options, join the convent or become a courtesan. Veronica opts for the latter. Quickly gaining high esteem with her wit and beauty, she becomes one of the top courtesans. Marco, having been forced to marry another woman grows jealous of the men she takes as lovers. They reconnect and Veronica stops taking other clients until war breaks out and she is forced to seduce the king of France to secure his military support. While the war is being fought at sea, plague breaks out and religious zealots claim it is punishment for the city's moral degradation bringing with them the Inquisition.While the story of this movie is superb, it does tend to feel a bit slow. However, as the story unfolds it ensnares. I found myself completely enveloped in the characters that are all very well portrayed by the actors. Historically, it is not entirely accurate, but again it never claims to be. It is simply a dramatic love story loosely based on events that really happened.Dangerous Beauty may be seen by some as a feminist movie that supports prostitution, but I see it as a movie that shows what situations were like in the 16th century. Women were not seen as people, but objects to be bought and sold. Veronica Franco was on of the women throughout history that showed that women could be intelligent and have thoughts of their own. People like her have helped shaped the world to promote free thought and diversity.",Dangerous Beauty
95,rhiacharles,Gentle movie based on a true story,7,26 May 2012,"The reason that I wanted to watch this movie is because I am actually a modern day Courtesan in London.The days of the traditional style Courtesans have ended but in their place are ladies who have just the same skills, wit and intelligence. I went to Venice recently and had a private tour guide who took great pleasure in mentioning Veronica Franco and what great things she did for Venice and particularly the impoverished and destitute prostitutes.Sometimes, methinks, times have not changed too much in terms of attitude to 'ladies of pleasure'.Rhia Charles www.rhiacharles.co.uk",Dangerous Beauty
96,Firstclassblonde,One of the best and most passionate movies ever made,10,9 October 2004,"This particular movie was lost in the shuffle somewhere but I am certainly glad I found it. Catherine McCormack (Braveheart) portrays an innocent girl, that loses in love so decides to do what she has to do just to have him any way possible. It's a very backwards Cinderella. A good girl that falls in love with a ""prince"" (he's from a family with a title and she's not) but will true love prevail? Rufus Sewell is to die for, the sexiest and most talented actor to come our way in years. The rest of the fine cast Oliver Platt, Moira Kelly, Naomi Watts, Fred Ward and Jacqueline Bisset are very convincing in their portrayals of these period characters. I have had every single one of my friends watch it and they all have enjoyed it as much as I have. The music is fantastic and we even get a short history lesson. With this sensational cast, the storyline that is based on actual poetry books from a Courtisan, it really is my favorite historical romance of all time. Take the time to find this rare gem and see it as soon as possible.",Dangerous Beauty
97,chokolatta,Amazing,10,14 June 2005,"A work of artI love everything about this movie................... Catherine McCormick is beautiful........... The music is great. The dialog is great............... The costumes are great And the last 15 minutes are amazing!It's one of my favorite movies...I think one of the aspects of this movie is still relevant today: Women who are beautiful, intelligent and comfortable with their sexuality are a threat to society.I looked up the poet Veronica Franco to find out more information about her, and her life was very close to what the movie portrayed.",Dangerous Beauty
98,matisyra,"Overrated as a historical drama, underrated as a guilty pleasure",3,17 July 2005,"To call Dangerous Beauty an adaptation of Margaret Rosenthal's The Honest Courtesan is beyond insulting to Ms. Rosenthal  it's bewildering, quite frankly. The Veronica Franco depicted in Rosenthal's rather scholarly and unsentimental biography was a feminist heroine and a rather unusual figure for her or any time. Veronica Franco in Herskowitz's pretty romance novel is anything but a feminist heroine, for all the Lifetime channel rhetoric.First, a few historical corrections. According to Ms. Rosenthal's scholarship, Franco's meeting with Henri III (then King of Poland, not yet of France and not there at request of the Doge) was more important to her poetry than Venetian politics or her sex life, her trial before the inquisition was quite different, her relationship with the Veniers was far more professional and her life in general was far less dependent on men, let alone a man. Henri III was traveling through Venice when Franco entertained him at her home and may well have slept with her. However, the relationship seemed more courtly than sexual  Franco even gave him gifts on his departure, two sonnets and a miniature. What Rosenthal remarks on are the sonnets she wrote in tribute to Henri in true (masculine) court style and the likelihood that Franco was trying to collaborate with other poets on a book in the future King of France's honor. Franco's poems on the event were courtier's poems and not love poems; in fact, she pulled of the rather difficult task of using the story of Jupiter and Danae as a model for her poems and undermining the eroticism her contemporaries (men) highlighted when using that myth. Franco often reclaimed overly sexualized female figures and made them into civic, public figures  a pity that Herskowitz and script writer Dominy do the reverse to Franco.Franco's trial before the inquisition wasn't the maudlin thing it was in the movie, either. It wasn't even public and her accuser was a disgruntled and unpaid tutor, claiming she participated in rituals and other rites in her house. Veronica got out of it basically by admitting to allowing her servants to have these rituals and participating in them at times, but she never believed in it and it wasn't a sin or demonic if one didn't believe in it. She was hardly the only person to be pulled before the inquisition at the time  Domenico Venier, her patron, was also brought before the inquisition because of a servant. Rather than having to defend her sexual behavior, she was in the position many men found themselves in. Their financial or employment practices irked a servant and the servant accused them of heresy. Unsexy as it is, Veronica's trial could be more easily compared to Martha Stewart's trial than to the sentimental theatrics in Herskowitz's film.Historically speaking, there is no reason to believe that Marco and Veronica were as close as the film shows. They were friends and fellow poets with great respect for the each other's work, certainly, and quite possibly lovers. Veronica had many lovers, though, and she did not ride off to some 'happily ever after' with Marco at all. There were other lovers she seemed to be more passionate about, including those who fathered some of her children, also left out of the film.So, as a historical drama it fails because it ignores historical fact and I think it fails even more as a feminist revision. I don't think Franco's story needs any revisionism to be feminist, and certainly not of this kind. When the heroine is more than happy to commit herself entirely to a man who has no qualms about publicly humiliating a wife who never injured him and sees nothing wrong with demanding Veronica's fidelity without offering his own, I can't consider her a feminist role model. When a film cheerfully sets up a dichotomy between the sexually adventurous but ultimately submissive mistress and the frigid, demanding wife, I can't call the film exactly a paragon of feminist values, especially when the mistress wins out. Why was there no sympathy for Guilia, who seemed quite unhappy with her lot and had no way out? Why no pretty speech about perpetual inconsequence for her, especially when she's the one is consigned to that more than any of the others. Apparently, if a woman isn't ready to be cheerfully sexually accessible to a man who can afford her, she doesn't deserve decent and respectful treatment from her husband. How this is a liberating message escapes me.The only level this film does work is as a guilty pleasure, and on that level it's fantastic. The cast is pretty, the set is pretty, the costumes are pretty, the music is pretty (if a bit sentimental and overpowering) and if you don't think about it too hard, it's a nice fairy tale. Had they not tried to base this on real people and had they deleted the ridiculous, Maxim-friendly just-do-me-feminism, it would have been a satisfying romance novel of a film. However, in trying to give this substance, they made it at best vaguely offensive.",Dangerous Beauty

100,notethy,Most inspiring movie with beautiful dialogue,10,2 March 2006,"I stumbled upon this movie channel surfing late at night on the couch. From the title and the storyline, I thought it would be a cheesy movie...well, far from it! This is the most inspiring movie. I love the dialogues and the costumes! A very well done, well acted, well filmed movie with fantastic dialogues. I oohed and ahhed over the costumes, I love Venice...brings back memories from when i was there, I was inspired to live more passionately, I cry!!!! I cheer and rooted for Veronica, I yelled at Mafeo, I got boiling mad at the church and pope for their hypocrisy and a sense of such vulgar righteousness. A must see film!!!",Dangerous Beauty
