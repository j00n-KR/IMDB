0,TheLittleSongbird,"Not a bad film, but quite a big let down after Silence of the Lambs",6,31 May 2015,"This review is actually going to aim to judge Hannibal as a film on its own merits, rather than comparing it constantly to Silence of the Lambs. On its own, Hannibal is not a bad film, in fact while heavily flawed it is a fair and better-than-average one. However, it is an example of a sequel/adaptation where it is very difficult not to compare because Silence of the Lambs is such a brilliant film and a masterpiece of its type, and there were things that that film excelled in that Hannibal came up short in in comparison.Starting with what is good with Hannibal, the film looks great. The Italian locations are gorgeous and give a real hauntingly dreamy and macabre atmosphere. The photography and editing are also very stylish, complete with an appropriately brooding colour palette. Hans Zimmer's score is powerful stuff and adds so much to the atmosphere of the film, some of it is creepy and enough to make the heart race. It is not the overly-loud, overly-bombastic, dirge-like and one-note kind of the music that can be heard in some of Zimmer's later film scores(i.e. Man of Steel).Ridley Scott directs with assurance and with superb technical skill, also succeeding in giving some of the Italian scenes a chillingly dark quality. For about two thirds of the film, the gore while a lot of it is handled reasonably tastefully and the action is very violent without being too gratuitous and is also pretty efficient. The script is uneven, but a good amount of it is intriguing and there is delicious black humour aplenty too, a lot of it coming from Lecter.Again, the cast are not consistent as such, but most are fine, with the top honours going to Anthony Hopkins and Gary Oldman. Hopkins reprises his most iconic(and one of his best) role and does an impeccable job, again he is funny and creepy if occasionally going overboard which occasionally hurts the tension. Oldman is unrecognisable here thanks to some truly astounding make-up(couldn't tell it was him a lot of the time) and gives an extraordinary performance, Verger is more interesting and dimensional in the book where it was much easier to feel sympathy for him, but Oldman's interpretation is truly loathsome while giving a touch of campiness and affecting dimension. Frankie Faison is charming, and Giancarlo Gianini is great as the film's most rootable character.Julianne Moore disappoints however, she had the daunting task of replacing Jodie Foster(big shoes to fill) and does bravely. What really worked against Moore was the rather flat way Starling is written here when the writers could have embraced the opportunity to expand the character from the much more interesting way she was written in The Silence of the Lambs. Moore is a very good actress, but was rather bland here. Ray Liotta also felt out of place, a little annoying and sometimes he didn't seem to know what he was doing.More disappointing was that what worked so phenomenally in Silence of the Lambs came up well short here in Hannibal. The story starts off very engagingly and compellingly, and the Italian scenes fare very favourably with some really entertaining bits, but once back in the United States gets somewhat convoluted as a result of trying to do too many things at once and too weird and dark for its own good, especially in the third act. It does fall short on suspense and mystery while the chilling psychological resonance that was one of Silence of the Lambs' high points is missing. If some of the scripting didn't get as heavy-handed as it tended to, if the pacing(which was at times very ponderous) was tighter, if there was more chemistry between Hopkins and Moore and if some of the second half was less ridiculous, this would have probably been at least halfway solved.The characters could have been better written and developed, the most interesting character is Verger(and there is much more to him in the book with his sister Margot) and Pazzi the most sympathetic, other than that Starling and Lecter's personalities and characters could have been expanded upon(something I think should have happened seeing as it's a sequel) and the rest of the characters are bland stereotypes. The ending is also a let-down, far too over-the-top and even those with strong stomachs when watching films might find themselves repulsed.Overall, problematic and vastly inferior follow-up, but has several good qualities and isn't that bad. Just that it should have been much more considering the potential, source material and talent. 5.5/10 Bethany Cox",Hannibal
1,Leofwine_draca,Gory operatic nonsense,3,25 July 2016,"This follow-up to SILENCE OF THE LAMBS seems to be an either love it or hate it film. I'm sad to say that I fall into the latter camp, as while I found some of HANNIBAL moderately entertaining, as a whole I found it to be too long and too uninteresting to get excited about. I'll make it clear from the start that I've never read any of Thomas Harris' books so I can't comment on the link to them...Director Ridley Scott - now a hot property once again thanks to the success of GLADIATOR - injects his film with some lovely photography of the city of Florence, plus some impressively stylish scenes of action such as the opening shoot-out, which has to be one of the most realistic I've ever seen; in the cinema you can almost feel the bullets whizzing past you as the gunshots explode from the speakers and gravel flies into the air on screen. After this great start, not much seems to happen for a long time, which was my first inkling that something was wrong with this movie.When Lecter finally makes his screen appearance after what seems like an age, we find he's taken up a new job as a museum curator and seems to be a happy, law-abiding citizen. His only crime is to stab a would-be pickpocket in the crotch with a knife in a confrontation on the street, but otherwise he's just a normal-looking guy. Only when Lecter is cornered by policeman Pazzi and the employees of Mason Verger does he turn nasty - very nasty indeed.After lots more talk and plot development (so much goes on to make this film feel like an epic) we come to the a series of extra-gory scenes. The impressive use of CGI here is very good indeed, and highly realistic, making for some unforgettable images; it's a shame that the effects go far beyond the boundaries of taste and become mere gross-out moments. Otherwise, HANNIBAL's generally disappointing. Hopkins seems to relish his return to the role of Lecter, and manages to be scary in a couple of instances, and is the best actor in the movie. Julianne Moore, though, isn't really given that much material to work with and fails to be very expressive at all as Agent Starling; she seems to keep the same blank expression on her face throughout while delivering all of her lines in exactly the same way which makes her character seem emotion-free. In fact, I would go so far as to say that she's bad, a surprise as previously she's been impressive in her movies. Gary Oldman lets his makeup do the acting, but gives a great lisping voice to his character of the crippled Verger. Liotta is his usual snarling self; enough said. One more actor of note is the Italian old-timer Giancarlo Giannini, who really inhabits his crumpled detective Pazzi and makes him a fleshed-out, likable and believable character so that his death is all the more disturbing.There's something wrong with this movie that I can't quite pinpoint. It may be the dialogue, which somehow doesn't ring true, and sounds like it's been written down on paper instead of spoken out loud by real characters. Whatever it is, I felt myself coldly detached for the entire film so that I couldn't get excited about anything that happened, really. Although it only lasts for two and a quarter hours as well, those hours seem to last an age with the pace dawdling between action. Although the gore is plentiful, there are only a couple of minor jolts to be had, so on the scare-factor level this just isn't in the same league as MANHUNTER (thinking about that guy with the stocking over his head still makes my blood run cold) or SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. In fact it seems more like a comic-book strip with Hopkins as the lovable anti-hero who only attacks when provoked. Nobody else really matters. Altogether, HANNIBAL is a movie that leaves an unpleasant taste in the mouth and is no fun to watch in my mind.",Hannibal
2,SnoopyStyle,"Jodie Foster gone, Jonathan Demme gone, Only Anthony Hopkins back",6,21 September 2013,"It's ten years after 'The Silence of the Lambs' (1991) and ten years in the story as well. This time Julianne Moore is playing Clarice Starling. Also the director chair has changed. It was Jonathan Demme's, but now it's Ridley Scott's. The only main player that has returned is Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter.Mason Verger (Gary Oldman) is an old victim of Hannibal. With new information and his influence, he maneuvers Clarice to chase down Hannibal. Gary Oldman is obviously suppose to provide the new shock value, but he can't take down the master.This was never going to be good enough without Jonathan Demme and especially Jodie Foster. It grinds along slowly. There's a lot of story to get through and a lot of talking. All of it must be tracked closely. It's not as simple as the first one. In this one, there are different people in different story lines in Italy and the U.S. Also there is too much investigating behind computers. There is only so many ways to shoot that compellingly.Anthony Hopkins is as delicious as ever. Giancarlo Giannini is very compelling as Italian police inspector Rinaldo Pazzi. I'm willing to have Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling, but they keep playing those tapes that remind us that she wasn't in the first movie. Ray Liotta is a bad annoying cartoon of a boss. This movie has its moments mostly with Hopkins and Giannini. But it's not enough to have half of a movie.",Hannibal
3,gavin6942,The Saga Continues...,7,12 January 2017,"Living in exile, Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) tries to reconnect with now disgraced FBI agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore) and finds himself a target for revenge from a powerful victim.Having read the book, I can say they did a pretty fine job sticking to the story. Some of it is rather outrageous, but the book in many ways is even more outrageous. So any question of incredulity really must be asked of the book. (And to think the weird things that were left out!) Some of Ridley Scott's style choices are not my favorite. He has some strange slow motion shots, blurs and other things. I don't see the point. But overall he has crafted a decent thriller. Implausible, yes, but again, that really goes back to the absurd nature of the book.",Hannibal
4,lee_eisenberg,acceptable; there needn't be another,7,3 December 2006,"When I saw ""Hannibal"" when it first came out, I found it quite fascinating (although not any kind of masterpiece). Ever since ""Red Dragon"" came out, I've talked with many people, and they said that this one turned Hannibal Lecter into a character from a slasher movie, thereby weakening it. Well, I don't think that I would have put it like that. Granted, they make him a lot nastier here - but no less likable - but I didn't derive that his actions strayed from his persona as a pathological cannibal.Anyway, the plot has Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore) disgraced after a botched mission, while Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) is living a sedate life in Florence, Italy. Neither one knows that Lecter's former victim Mason Verger (an unrecognizable Gary Oldman) is plotting revenge. But nothing is to turn out as anyone expects.I will say that some aspects of the movie are a little predictable. First and foremost is Clarice's boss Paul Krendler (Ray Liotta). He's a chauvinistic pig - pun not intended - and anyone who knows violent movies knows that the creepy characters don't get off easily. You'd better believe that Paul doesn't get off easily. I guess that the one skin-crawl-inducing scene gives ""Hannibal"" the feel of a slasher movie.As for the whole part about whether or not it was acceptable to cast a different person as Clarice, I'll say that Julianne Moore did a good job. She made Clarice seem more depressed, even nervous, but never weak.So, it's a worthy movie. Although I will say that ""Red Dragon"" is a little better. And I think that most people agree that there needn't be another sequel.Also starring Giancarlo Giannini.",Hannibal
5,jboothmillard,Hannibal,6,19 April 2006,"10 years after the first time we saw probably the most evil film villain, he returns to terrorise us even more, and trust me, he just as bad, maybe worse than before. Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Sir Anthony Hopkins in his Oscar winning role) escaped some years ago from his cell, it is Clarice Starling's (Julianne Moore, instead of Oscar winner Jodie Foster who refused) to find him. They became concerned with him again after a call from a survivor of his monstrosity, Mason Verger (a surprising and hideous Gary Oldman), and Hannibal's put on the police's most wanted list. Throughout the film Hannibal does many horrifying things, but I don't remember him eating anybody, unless you count the ending when he has part of a man's head. Also starring Ray Liotta as Paul Krendler. In this film, the three most horrifying things Hannibal does is slid and hang a man from a theatre hall roof, cuts Liotta's head open and makes him eat part of his own brain, and the last moment, a kid on a plane eats a bit of this brain! Sir Ridley Scott truly captures almost the same horror that Jonathan Demme did. Sir Anthony Hopkins was number 7 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 1 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 1 on Britain's Finest Actors, and he was number 3 on The World's Greatest Actor, and Hannibal Lecter was number 1 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains. Good!",Hannibal
6,ccthemovieman-1,Much More Than Brain Food,10,1 February 2006,"I have to go against popular opinion on this one. Most people hate this film; I love it....well, 95 percent of it, anyway.The shame of it is that most people only remember the last 10 minutes, a totally gruesome scene in which the top of a man's head is cut off and he's fed a morsel of his own brain. Of course, it's disgusting and I don't find it easy to watch, either.However, the first two hours of the film offers a feast, if you'll pardon the pun, for the eyes and ears that is not revolting except for one other three-second shot. This is one of the most beautifully-filmed movies I've ever seen. Scene after scene is just jaw dropping and features some of the best shots, outside and inside, of Florence, Italy, you could ever imagine. Ridley Scott is known for his stylish direction and that is certainly the case here.The dialog is fascinating, led by Anthony Hopkins' famous ""Hannibal Lecter"" character, whose vocabulary and intelligent sarcasm and baiting are clever and entertaining to hear. Unlike ""Silence Of the Lambs,"" there is little verbal crudeness in this film, very little profanity at all. On the third viewing, I played this with the English subtitles on, so I could catch all the dialog.This was a much lower-key film than it's famous predecessor, which probably disappointed a lot of people who prefer a lot more violence and f-words in their crime movies.Although Jodie Foster performed well in the role of FBI Agent Clarice Starling, I preferred watching and listening to Julianne Moore play the part in this film. A ""sleeper"" here, too, was the great performance by Giancarlo Gianni, as the greedy Italian lawman, who winds up paying a huge price for his avarice.Like ""Godfather III,"" this is a very unjustly-criticized and overlooked third installment of a famous film trilogy.",Hannibal
7,moonspinner55,Withered sequel...with Hannibal our new Freddy Krueger,3,23 June 2007,"Overdue follow-up to Jonathan Demme's ""The Silence of the Lambs"" from 1991 reportedly cost a bundle to make, yet it looks grimy and ugly throughout. Where did all the money go? Ridley Scott directed from Thomas Harris' lackluster bestseller, bringing back both escaped killer Hannibal Lecter and FBI agent Clarice Starling, though only Anthony Hopkins returns from the original's stellar cast. Hopkins retains his evil panache, but it's the Freddy Krueger syndrome: more of him is really less. Julianne Moore is a weak Clarice, and our first glimpse of her--asleep in a van next to a block of dry ice!--is immediately disconcerting not only because this is Jodie Foster's role, but also due to the fact Moore changes positions in the long-shot. Scott goes for a straightforward approach, yet this is nothing more than a thriller in shorthand. We get none of the mystery or suspense of the previous film, everything here is laid out quickly and then slashed at (probably the best moment is the opening, which has an icy kick). The entire ending, much discussed here I'm sure, left me groaning. It's shock-stuff gone too far. *1/2 from ****",Hannibal
8,paul_haakonsen,"Once a cannibal, always a cannibal...",6,10 May 2014,"While not fully up to par with ""Silence of the Lambs"", ""Hannibal"" still was more interesting and more fulfilling then ""Hannibal Rising"". And if you enjoyed ""Silence of the Lambs"", then you really should do take the time to sit down and watch this movie as well.There is a nice cat-and-mouse feel to the movie, and director Ridley Scott have accomplished to put together an entertaining movie that does bring into the picture some disturbing mindsets and images from time to time.The characters are right on the money and there is some good character development and growth throughout the movie. And the cast that were in the movie were doing good jobs with their given roles. And while Julianne Moore is no Jodie Foster, she still managed to portray Clarice in a fulfilling way. Needless to say that Anthony Hopkins is, of course, fantastic once again in the role of Hannibal 'the cannibal' Lecter. I was surprised to find out that it was Gary Oldman who was playing Verger; I literally had no idea and just found out in 2014.There is a nice speed to the movie, in the sense that you are never left bored, and the movie does take you on a roller-coaster; sometimes it is fast and brutal, other times slow and seemingly safe (lulling the audience into a false sense of security). There were some nice enough twists and turns along the way, making the movie not overly predictable.""Hannibal"" is an entertaining movie and a well-worthy addition to the Lecter legacy. And it is definitely worth a watch.",Hannibal
9,Quinoa1984,"You'll laugh, you'll cringe, you'll want to eat brains (or maybe not)!",7,9 February 2001,"(Possible spoilers ahead)Ridley Scott's Hannibal can not match it's predecessor Silence of the Lambs or even it's original Manhunter, but it is pretty good as a thriller.  Sure there isn't a Jodie Foster, but now it's actually interesting to see Julianne Moore as a Clarice Starling 10 years later.  Here, she's back on the track of Lecter, played to still brilliant greatness by Sir Anthony Hopkins who returns as the Socrates meets Zombie man, who is now free in Florence Italy.  But she is not only trying to get him back in jail, but also to save him from revenge by the faceless Merger (played in almost unseeable ease by Gary Oldman).Plenty of unintentional laughs (sample: I've been to America, and I've had many good meals there), but suspense helps out along with fine performances despite the flaws of being a little less intriguing.  Warning though, some scenes are very gruesome; seeing Ray Liotta's skull pop open like Homer in that Simpson's episode and then seeing Lecter feed him his own brain is the most gory thing I've seen since the creature baby from Eraserhead.  Based on Thomas Harris' novel.  A-",Hannibal
10,sunwarrior13,Hannibal Does Not Hold A Candle,8,24 October 2011,"Jodie Foster decided not to reprise her role as Clarice Starling in the movie,Hannibal which happens to be the sequel to Silence Of The Lambs.That led to the demise of the film from attaining into becoming a cinema masterpiece.Hannibal is based on the sequel novel of the same name by Thomas Harris. It is the much-anticipated follow-up to the Oscar-winning The Silence of the Lambs.While Foster does not return,Anthony Hopkins returns as Dr. Hannibal Lecter - one of the world's most cunning and feared serial killers.He resurfaces after a decade in hiding to toy with FBI agent Clarice Starling,who was portrayed instead by Julianne Moore. As Starling's career flounders thanks to a drug bust gone wrong, Lecter attempts to elude a greedy Italian police detective who's willing to alert the authorities to his presence in Florence for a price. In the meantime, a maimed but wealthy former victim of Lecter's named Mason Verger,played by Gary Oldman plans to get his revenge on Lecter in a most unusual and grisly fashion. It remains true that Lecter has become an iconic serial killer in cinema and there is no actor who can portray that role aside from Hopkins.In this film,he does not disappoint.The cinematography was also worthy of mention since the movie was shot in Florence,Italy which happens to be one of the great places in the world. It provides class to the film.Also,worthy of mention are the performances of the other actors involved in the film like Oldman as Verger and Ray Liotta as the official the Verger bribes.The direction was also done well by the reliable Ridley Scott. With the reasons mentioned,the movie provides great entertainmentBut what made the movie fall short from becoming a cinema masterpiece? After Jodie Foster passed on the role of Clarice Starling,many actresses have tried to secure the role like Angelina Jolie, Hilary Swank and Ashley Judd.Hopkins tried to make an influence on casting the new Clarice and she chose Julianne Moore.That choice did have some effect on their chemistry as Moore and Hopkins lacked it when communicating together as Hannibal and Clarice.It fell short as compared to Hopkins chemistry with Foster.Another thing about it is that Clarice was known to have become an intelligent woman from Silence has become a vulnerable and tough one in this movie.Although Moore did well in her performance,the new Clarice is far from what the viewers know especially to the fans of Silence of the Lambs. Aside from Moore's portrayal,the movie also fell short in providing suspense and tension in the story.In summary,Hannibal does not hold a candle to Silence Of The Lambs.",Hannibal
11,Theo Robertson,Silly And Uneven,5,3 January 2003,"I don`t know if it existed in the novel of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS but the impression I got from that film was that Clarice Starling was very uncomfortable in the presence of men . This character trait is totally ignored in HANNIBAL as the film opens with Agent Starling asleep in a police van surrounded with men and as the film continues we see that the Clarice Starling of this version is a strong willed and assertive woman at odds with the timid insecure girl of the 1991 film . I guess some people may say this is character development but I`d call it a lack of internal continiuty and I wasn`t too happy with the way the character was underused either.Julianne Moore made little impression with her portrayal of Starling though that`s through little fault of her own because it`s always the most difficult job of an actor playing a role made famous by someone else , and as I said Starling is sidelined in much of the film . But still I would have liked to have seen Jodie Foster return to the part . As for the other actors Hopkins is competent but by no means spell binding , Liota gives the impression that a robot played his role throughout the film and not just in * THAT * scene , Giancarlo Giannini is good , but Gary Oldman absolutely steals the show as Mason Verger playing the role just the right side of camp complete with some great make up .As for the other aspects of HANNIBAL Ridley Scott directs with an almost operatic touch , and I mean that both figuratively and literally . You really do get the feeling watching this that Scott`s ambition in life is to do a remake of AMADEUS with Hopkins in the role of Atonio Salieri . But the one major flaw with HANNIBAL is the script by Mamet and Zaillian . Again I have little idea of what the novel is like since my entire knowledge of it is confined to what I`ve read about it on this site but a couple of screenwriters with their great track record should be able to produce a satisfying screenplay no matter how poor the source novel . Here they fail , especially with the ending which is riducously over the top . But it was probably a good idea to omit Verger`s lesbian sister as this would have made the film descend into a camp joke",Hannibal
12,preppy-3,So-so,6,20 February 2001,"Sequel to ""Silence of the Lambs"" isn't half as good, but has its moments. Hannibal ""the cannibal"" Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) is still free 10 years after the first movie.  He's been good (no eating people) and he's living in Florence under a different name.  But, through a series of very involved circumstances, he is forced back into ""business"".  Clarice Sterling (Julianne Moore) is on hand to try and stop him.  The film is slow, much too long, quite dull at first--also, the plot is needlessly convoluted.  What keeps it watchable is beautiful wide-screen cinematography; good acting by Hopkins, Moore, and Ray Liotta; a VERY gruesome climax.  But mostly, I was bored and uninterested.  The story just doesn't have the kick the first one had...not one scary sequence is in this.  So it's OK--but nothing special.",Hannibal
13,LeonLouisRicci,It's a Sequel for Pete's Sake,7,30 July 2014,"Like Every Other Smart Mouth Review, here's a Few Dining Metaphors. While the Original, Silence of the Lambs (1991), was Gourmet Cuisine, this Sequel is like the Hardly Nutritious Fast Food, Tasteless but Filling.Director Ridley Scott and His A-Team of Actors and Writers Serve Up a Gory Horror Movie that is Repulsive yet Watchable, Although Some Sensitives may Purge. It Derives its Playful Pleasures from Over the Top Violence and Brain-Numbing Dark Displays of Grotesque Goings On.Subtlety is Absent in Every Frame as the Filmmakers Go for the Gut, as in Wrenching. But here it is and After All, it is Definitely Not the Original it is a Sequel for Goodness Sake. It Never Even Remotely Tries to be Anything Like it.Anthony Hopkins is Off the Chart, Out of His Mind, and Enjoying Every Minute of Lector's Descent into Ludicrous Caricature and Julianne Moore is Playing Charlice Starling like the Haunted Depressive that She must have Become after Engaging in Mind Games with the Master. She is Barely able to Keep it Together and On Top of that She is Berated at Every Turn by the FBI and Hannibal won't let Her Forget it. She seems Doped Up most of the Time even Before She is Doped Up with Morphine.Overall, this is Grand Guignol Grossness and Gore. But don't for a Minute Think it was Attempting to be Anything but.

14,poolandrews,"Very good sequel, better than The Silence of the Lambs in my opinion...",7,20 September 2006,"Hannibal starts with FBI agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore) involved in a drugs shoot-out where her partner is killed & she herself kills a woman carrying a baby. Her bosses at the FBI aren't happy & decide to make her disappear by putting her back on the Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) case as he is still a wanted man. The FBI has recently received new information from Mason Verger (Gary Oldman), a child abuser & Lecter's 4th victim whom he cut the face off & fed to his dog. Now horribly disfigured Verger thinks of nothing but revenge & provides Clarice with information that leads to Florence where Italian police inspector Rinaldo Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini) has discovered that Dr. Fell an arts academic is in fact the notorious cannibalistic serial killer Hannibal Lecter. However instead of going to the FBI Pazzi decides to sell the information to Verger, Lecter soon finds himself on the run from Mason's men, the FBI & several large flesh eating pigs...This English American co-production was directed by Ridley Scott who, to some extent, had the almost impossible & thankless task of making a sequel to the multi Oscar winning hugely successful horror/thriller The Silence of the Lambs (1991) which I myself thought was a great film. Persoanlly I actually think Hannibal is a better, more entertaining film that I would rather watch than the slightly overrated original. The script by David Mamet & Steven Zaillian was again based on a novel by Thomas Harris & is a different sort of film to the original with enough variation to stand on it's own, it moves along at a fair pace although there are a few slow patches here & there. While watching Hannibal I was thinking beauty & the beast, it uses elegant classical music & features the beautiful Italian city of Florence along with it's impressive architecture. While at the same time Hannibal also features plenty of nastiness, spilled guts, cannibalism, corruption, greed, murder & betrayal. I thought it made for an excellent & interesting contrast & I thought it worked extremely well. Most of the character's in Hannibal come across as bad guys although the central figure of Hannibal is as fascinating & alluring as ever, even though he's a ruthless cannibalistic killer you like him, I'm not sure why but it's true.Director Scott does a great job & that divide between the exquisite & the sleaze creates a good atmosphere, the film is fantastically shot & has lots of style. There are numerous great scenes here, from killer pigs to the infamous dinner at the end. The special effects are very good & I honestly didn't recognise Oldman under all that make-up. There's some decent gore here & it's maybe a little gory for the average viewer, there's slit throats, stabbings, shootings, cannibalism & 'that' scene at the end that freaks everyone I know out even if I mention it!With a supposed budget of about $87,000,000 Hannibal is extremely well made although I have to say I was very surprised to learn that it cost that much although it is suggested that there's at least another hour of footage that was cut from the final version so maybe some of those $'s ended up on the cutting room floor. The acting is great, Hopkins as Hannibal is class, Moore does OK as Starling & fills Jodie Foster's shoes well enough.Hannibal is a good film, no actually it's a very good film & I think it's a more entertaining film than the original. Despite it's slightly overlong running time & the odd dull patch I liked it, it's as simple & straight forward as that. A sequel Young Hannibal: Behind the Mask (2007) is a prequel that features Hannibal Lecter as a teenager so no Anthony Hopkins...",Hannibal
15,CinemaSerf,Really misses Jodie Foster...,6,21 July 2020,"As sequals go, this isn't a bad one - but somehow we are a bit more sanitised to the evil of Sir Anthony Hopkins' ""Hannibal Lecter"" in this; and Julianne Moore doesn't quite have the intensity of Jodie Foster as FBI agent ""Clarice"". The story is also a bit too contrived: Millionaire Gary Oldman (""Verger"") tries to use ""Clarice"" to lure, for motives of revenge, ""Lecter"" out from his secret existence as a museum curator in Florence. Once she discovers where he is, she alerts the carabinieri to keep an eye on him; one of whom quite fancies the reward so tries to take matters into his own hands... Hopkins returns to the US with only one aim in mind, and a cunning game of cerebral chess ensues. It comes across as more of a compendium of short stories rather than as a flowing narrative; there is still plenty of gruesomeness, but without the subtlety - the script isn't at all sophisticated; and though there is plenty of classical music trying to replicate some of the class of ""Silence of the Lambs"" (1991) it just doesn't quite work. It's a good enough effort, but just lacks that je ne sais quoi.",Hannibal

The avidly awaited sequel to the 1991 suspense thriller differs vastly from its impressive predecessor. Indeed, Oscar-winning actor Anthony Hopkins reprises his role as the diabolical Dr. Lecter, a notorious serial killer with a taste for human flesh, and Hopkins reincarnates Lecter in another frightening but flawless performance. Julianne (""Boogie Nights"") Moore easily erases any memory of Jodie Foster as serious, straightforward West Virginia country girl FBI Agent Clarice Starling. British ""Gladiator"" director Ridley Scott replaces American director Jonathan (""Beloved"") Demme. Whereas Demme took a 'just the facts' approach, Scott turns it into ""Blade Runner 2.""

While ""Lambs"" curbed its violence, ""Hannibal"" indulges in a gore fest of special effects. Yes, Dr. Lecter cooks a bad guy's brain and feeds it to him.

The Guinness Book of World Records lists her as the Fed with the highest number of confirmed kills. Unfortunately, she takes lots of flak when a drug bust backfires on her. Clarice had to gun down a crack-dealing mother wearing a baby strapped to her chest. The FBI hangs her out to dry. Meanwhile, Lecter's only surviving victim, disfigured pedophile millionaire Mason Verger (Gary Oldman of ""True Romance"") plots to kidnap Hannibal and feed him to the hogs. Verger learns the best way to lure Hannibal out is to put Clarice in jeopardy. Nevertheless, Hannibal suspects Verger and proves difficult to fool. Similar to ""Gladiator,"" ""Hannibal"" follows its anti-hero full circle back from Italy to Washington. Not only does he stylishly disembowel a greedy informant who sought to cash in on Verger's $3-million dollar reward for Lecter, but also he comes to Clarice's rescue after the badguys shoot her.""Hannibal"" is a wide-open, anything goes, no-holds-barred chiller. Clarice performed the heroics in ""Lambs,"" but Lecter handles those duties in ""Hannibal."" Remember how Arnold Schwarzenegger's cold-blooded ""Terminator"" got converted into a good guy in ""T-2?"" Basically, Scott and his scribes turn Hannibal into the good guy. Specifically, Hannibal's violence redeems instead of condemns him. Everybody he Cuisinartes deserves his or her demise. Arguably, ""Hannibal"" glorifies one of society's worst fiends, but no actual serial killer on record compares with the witty, urbane Dr. Lecter. Although it lacks the suspenseful tenacity of ""Lambs,"" ""Hannibal"" emerges as an enthralling sequel that the squeamish should shun until prime-time television tones it down. Ultimately, ""Hannibal"" qualifies more as an art house horror spectacle than an inspired but straightforward FBI thriller like ""Lambs.""",Hannibal
17,grantss,Intriguing but disappointing,6,5 March 2016,"Intriguing but disappointing.A sequel to Silence of the Lambs. After an FBI operation doesn't go according to plan and attracts much negative publicity, Agent Clarice Starling is reassigned. She must now track down Hannibal Lecter, who escaped from her custody several years previously. Meanwhile, Lecter is living in Italy. However, an Italian policeman has worked out who he is. One of Lecter's victims (of sorts), Mason Verger, is also out to track him down...There was no way this was ever going to come close to the quality of Silence of the Lambs. Initially, however, director Ridley Scott does give it a good try. The set up was a bit slow but once things started coming together, the moving was quite enthralling. At no stage does it have the psychological aspects and tension of Silence of the Lambs, but it was interesting nevertheless.The conclusion ruins some of this good work, however. The wrap up with the one foe seems rushed, and too easy. Then the wrap up with the other is drawn out too much and has goriness just for the sake of goriness. Throw in a few implausibilities, contrivances and a very shallow attempt at a psychological or philosophical reason for what is going on and the ending is very disappointing.Good work by Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore (replacing Jodie Foster) in the lead roles. Ray Liotta is a quite hammy as Krendler (or maybe his character was just written very badly - could be both). Gary Oldman is in the cast too, but you definitely won't recognise him...Overall, it's okay, but could have been a lot better.",Hannibal
18,Boba_Fett1138,A moving painting,8,9 March 2003,"The biggest mistake most people make is that they compare this movie to ""Silence of the Lambs"". But please try not to, try to see this as an individual movie, this way you'll enjoy it more and maybe then you'll see how wonderful this movie truly is.From the excellent ""action movie"" like beginning till the tense and gross ending this movie knows how to scare you, excite you, amuse you and disgust you.Some people say the Hannibal character isn't scary enough because he isn't behind glass this time. I have to disagree. The way he stalks and make inspector Pazzi(Giancarlo Giannini) feel very uncomfortable is done very well and really scary. There's only one thing in the movie that scares me more and that's Mason Verger (an unrecognizable and brilliant Gary Oldman) His face is absolutely disgusting in a good way.Getting Ridley Scott to direct this movie was a great move. The atmosphere is really good and dark. Hans Zimmer delivers a nice soundtrack that really sets the mood. But what's even better is the cinematography. The scene's in the movie are beautiful and it's like you're watching a moving painting. (Especially the Florance, Italy scene's)Absolutely wonderful!

19,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Less than 'Silence', but more than 'Dragon'",6,21 October 2004,"After having recently seen The Silence of the Lambs, just to review it and refresh my memory of it, and being somewhat bored by it, I sat down to see this, even though I didn't have too fond memories of it. This is the more ""action-like"" Hannibal Lecter film(whereas 'Silence' is the psychological, and Red Dragon is the half-cooked thriller-wannabe), as there is plenty of shooting, chasing and a fair bit of killing in the movie. Ridley Scott makes very good use of slow-motion shots, and utilizes quick cuts and some intense editing to keep shootouts and chases (somewhat) exciting and (occasionally) interesting. The plot is pretty good, but it just seems a little like it was just written to give the Hannibal Lecter fanatics a chance to see the good doctor in action, rather than tell an important story about him. The pacing isn't particularly good, and the film can be almost unbearable on repeated viewings. The acting is good, Hopkins is great, as always, and Julianne Moore is surprisingly good as Jodie Fosters replacement in the role of Clarice Starling. Both Ray Liotta and Gary Oldman are great as well, but that's too be expected from them. It was nice to see Liotta play a character so far away from the gangster-types he usually portrays. Oldman's character reminded me of his character from The Fifth Element; something in the way he talks, I think. The characters are well-written, credible and diverse. The effects are great; how they turned Oldman's face into that disgusting skin-less... mass... great. Ridley Scott understands horror(as evidenced quite clearly in one of his first films, Alien), and he scares the audience pretty good, through gory scenes, where only a few of them are overdone(the ""bowels out"" sequence was a little ridiculous... how did he cut through all that clothes with one quick cut from the knife?). The dialog is mostly well-written. Any fan of Hannibal Lecter will enjoy most of what he says, does and pretty much all of the scenes that even hints at him. All in all, a decent enough film, but too poorly paced and very little of interest to anyone not interested in Lecter, or who's not a very big fan of any of the actors. I recommend it to big fans of Ridley Scott and any of the main actors, and any fan of Hannibal Lecter. Fans of The Silence of the Lambs might want to check it out, too. 6/10",Hannibal
20,view_and_review,Someone just kill Hannibal already,5,19 June 2007,"Hannibal is officially making me sick. Nevermind that the movie featured Julliane Moore for the part of Clarice, thereby replacing the incomparable Jody Foster, but is anybody else as perturbed as I am that a lunatic cannibal is on the loose? This movie was a bit romanticized by having Hannibal come back to America, where he is a wanted felon, to come to the aide of Clarice. I was somewhat excited to see that he had been captured and was probably going to suffer severely for his crimes, but that excitement quickly turned to disappointment and disgust when the heroine came to his rescue (albeit it was for his arrest). Hannibal is a social misfit and a perverse killer worthy of the most horrific punishment, yet he is able to slip away time and time again. I would have been much more delighted if this movie ended with his capture and, preferably, his punishment.",Hannibal
21,Uriah43,"The Sequel to ""Silence of the Lambs""",6,3 May 2016,"Although ten years have passed since FBI Agent ""Clarice Starling"" (now played by Julianne Moore) helped capture the serial killer known as Buffalo Bill, the memory of the psychotic psychiatrist named ""Hannibal Lector"" (Anthony Hopkins) still haunts her. However, she isn't the only person who needs closure as Hannibal's fourth victim, ""Mason Verger"" (Gary Oldman) has spent a fortune trying to track him down in order to punish him for the ghastly actions that Hannibal committed upon him. And, as luck would have it, an Italian detective named ""Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi"" (Giancarlo Giannini) believes he has information concerning the location of Hannibal which--for a price of $3 million--he will gladly point him out to Mason's men. What nobody counts on is the fact that Agent Starling is equally committed to having Hannibal brought into custody and that puts her right in the middle of a very dangerous situation. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this sequel to ""Silence of the Lambs"" wasn't nearly as good as its predecessor. For starters, Julianne Moore failed to attain the same level of excellence for this role as Jodie Foster did in her Academy Award-winning performance. That's not to say that her performance was necessarily bad-but neither was it that extraordinary either. Likewise, although there were certainly some gory scenes, the suspense wasn't nearly as keen and this also had an effect as well. In short, while this film certainly didn't measure up to its predecessor, I still found it somewhat entertaining and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",Hannibal
22,ferguson-6,Elegantly violent,7,14 February 2001,"Greetings again from the darkness.  It is always disheartening when a director, even a superb one such as Ridley Scott, mishandles a sequel to a great movie.  When the story involves one of the most fascinating characters in movie history, it is all the more disappointing.  Hannibal Lechter mesmermizes me.  His elegance, his rationalization of his disgusting actions, his speech patterns, his humor, his obsession with beauty, properness, and especially Clarice, captivate my attention. Ridley Scott just doesn't get it.  Blood and guts are not what Hannibal is about. Although I must say any movie with a brief appearance by Spike Jonze (director of ""Being John Malkovich"") and a wonderful supporting performance by Italian screen legend, Giancarlo Giannini gains some leeway!  The role of Clarice is poorly written in this sequel, so it is not fair to compare Julianne Moore to Jodie Foster.  The problem with this movie is script and execution.  The thrill of the chase in the original does not exist in this one.  There are no real mind games between good and evil.  As a matter of fact, Hannibal's evil is downplayed thanks to the twisted actions of an unrecognizable Gary Oldman.  We even find ourselves rooting for Lechter. The obvious institutional corruptness is played by the usually fine Ray Liotta.  What a joke ... and a waste.  Too much of a good thing is never best.  Where's the tease?  This is more cold slap in the face than psychological thriller.  I hear a prequel is in the works.  PLEASE find a new director.  Return the evil of Lechter to the heights he deserves.  Pay attention to the remarkable score and use of music.  It prevents the film from being just another slasher.",Hannibal
23,ferguson-6,Elegantly Violent,7,11 February 2001,"Greetings again from the darkness.  This much anticipated sequel will not become the classic that the orginal is.  A new director, even a talented one such as Ridley Scott, usually fails to capture the soul of the original. This movie does reinforce Dr. Hannibal Lechter's status as one of the most fascinating characters in movie history.  His blend of violence and elegance is unlike any other, even capturing our empathy at times.  This is no Freddy Kreuger or Michael Myers.  This movie throws in a third evil element, played by an unrecognizable Gary Oldman.  This twist allows us to feel for, even root for Hannibal.  Of course, there is the predictable corrupt big government type, this time played by the usually fine Ray Liotta.  This role is ludicrous ... unbelievable, even cartoonish in its portrayal. Sir Anthony Hopkins, on the other hand, has his character nailed.  He creeps you out, makes you smile, and then totally grosses you out.  Marvelous!  Julianne Moore is OK as Clarice Starling, but the role is not as juicy as what Jody Foster had to work with in the original.  Other than Lechter, the music and score of the film provide a haunting backdrop.  Very well done.  The movie is also very well edited.  Yes, technically it is big time movie making at its finest.  My problem is the movie is WAY too violent, gross, and blood-spurting for its own good.  The strength of the first was the script and characters.  This approach was avoided in the sequel.  The visual senses are bombarded, not the mental senses.  This movie is NOT FOR YOUNG KIDS!  I say this because most R movies I attend have a high number of under 13 kids in attendance.  On a positive note, pay attention to the excellent performance by former Italian lead man, Giancarlo Giannini.  It is wonderful to see him in a high budget film.  He is and has always been, a terrific acting talent.",Hannibal

Clarice is demoted to a desk job until she is contacted by Mason Verger. He is in a wheelchair and has no skin on his face. He plans to feed Hannibal Lector to wild boars and assigns Clarice to track him down. Many predictable developments follow including a brainless investigator who is murdered because common sense eludes him. Ridley Scott is a superb director as proved with Alien and Blade Runner but this hardly measures up to those successes. Anthony Hopkins demonstrated great skill as Hannibal in The Silence of the Lambs but here he is reduced as a slasher film monster. Julianne Moore hardly replaces Jodie Foster as Clarice because she renders the character unlikable. Ray Liotta plays Clarice's partner whose function is to argue. Gary Oldman as Verger is a role introduced as a child molester whom Lector took on as a client in therapy. That is where his condition began, and making him a child molester only excuses the screenwriter to permit Lector to commit an applauded murder, which works against it. Giancarlo Giannini plays the air head inspector whose head is so empty that it must have left Hannibal greatly disappointed when examining it.

Hopkins is rather good in the role, but all in all I just didn't enjoy the plot all that much.  The best part about this movie was the gore.  For an R movie this one was rather gory, but I am guessing since the director made the Oscar movie Gladiator just the previous summer and it had Sir Anthony Hopkins in it the ratings board my have let quite a bit slide.  It is no secret the ratings board plays favorites, heck I think if Spider-man was pg-13, Star Wars should have been too.  Lucas though has some influence.

36,sddavis63,"A Poor Sequel To ""Silence Of The Lambs""",3,11 May 2002,"Having enjoyed ""Silence Of The Lambs"" several years ago, I looked forward to the eventual opportunity to see this much-anticipated sequel. Frankly, I wish I hadn't seen it. It spoiled my good memories.Where ""Silence Of The Lambs"" was a taut psychological thriller in which the relationship between Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter was the most fascinating aspect, ""Hannibal"" contains virtually none of that suspense. It emphasizes violence over psychology - gratuitous violence; the gorier the better it seems. Only once - in the last ten minutes or so - does the Hannibal/Clarice relationship get explored in an interesting way (I won't say what happens here, but it bumped the movie up maybe one point in my estimation.) The rest of the movie is little more than a somewhat high-brow slasher movie. Very disappointing.Performances were passable; nothing more. Anthony Hopkins reprised the role of Dr. Lecter but didn't seem to bring either the same depth or the same energy to the character that he did in ""Silence."" Julianna Moore struggled valiantly with the role of Clarice Starling, but - her efforts notwithstanding - Jodie Foster was sorely missed. The most ridiculous performance (or at least the most ridiculous character) was Gary Oldman playing Mason Verger, a former patient and mutilated victim of Lecter. His appearance at the beginning of the movie appears to be for the sake of shock value alone, and the character manages to add nothing more than a cartoonish quality to this movie.My advice? If you loved ""Silence Of The Lambs"" stay away from this nonsensical sequel. They have virtually nothing in common save a couple of the same characters.

39,bowmanblue,Never understood (all) the hate,8,12 January 2017,"Yes, 'Silence of the Lambs' was a classic. If you're looking for deep, nasty performances (which cumulate with Anthony Hopkins even winning an Oscar) then Silence of the Lambs is for you. However, if you're the majority who believe that Sir Hopkins makes a better Hannibal Lector than that other bloke in (technically the predecessor) 'Red Dragon' then you should get plenty of fun out of the – simply-titled – 'Hannibal.' If you're thinking of watching 'Hannibal' then it's probably not too much of a spoiler to say that it starts out with the insane serial killer Hannibal 'the cannibal' Lector on the run and quietly evading the authorities. However, his life is about to take an inevitable turn for the dramatic when his paths cross former (how should I describe her – friend? Colleague? Inquisitor?) Clarice Starling (only played by Julianne Moore rather than Jodie Foster). Therefore, our favourite human-eater is forced out of retirement to cause more mayhem.So, 'Hannibal,' like so many sequels, doesn't really live up to the original. However, that's not for the want to trying. It has many things going for it. Obviously, Anthony Hopkins is one of them (and the main one to be sure). He's as creepy and chilling as ever and, now that he's on the loose, it makes you wonder if anyone is really safe. You also have Ridley Scott behind the camera providing excellent shot composition, atmosphere and performances. And, don't believe everything you hear about recasting Foster with Moore. I'm not saying against Foster, but – in my humble opinion – Moore is actually a better Agent Starling than Foster. Then, to cap it all, you have an – almost unrecognisable – Gary Oldman as a completely insane former victim of Lector, now hell-bent on revenge.So, take all four of those plus points on any other movie and you'd probably get guaranteed of an instant classic. Sadly, not so here. 'Hannibal' was met with indifference from many, including die-hard fans of Silence of the Lambs. I like 'Hannibal,' but I can see where they're coming from. This film does tend to simply lack direction. It's like there are so many good pieces to its puzzle, yet they're never really lined out in any particular order to link them seamlessly together. In short, 'Hannibal' is all over the place.Yet, despite this, I enjoy it for what it is and regularly watch it. As long as you're not expecting anything quite as 'fluid' as Silence of the Lambs and are fans of any or all of the central actors/directors then there's definitely something here to be enjoyed.Just don't look too deeply at the fog. It's everywhere. It's like a 'dry ice' machine was left running on every exterior scene at night. Weird.",Hannibal

For the most part, I don't feel like a sequel to Silence of the Lambs was necessary or even wanted, that movie was perfect the way it is and it's not a story that needed any continuation or further development, that's exactly what this movie does and it never manages to captivate it's audiences like the first movie did. It seems to forget the main thing that made Lambs so good, and that is the intense dialogue and discussions between Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling, these talks offered real thrills, instead all of their dialogue is simply to provide development in the story and spoon feed the audience, this movie goes for visual horror instead of verbal, which is much less powerful and also simply disgusting, no one wanted to see the graphic images that are shown in this, the last twenty minutes go way too far, and particularly the last scene is just too much, it isn't frightening, it is repulsive. The cast is outstanding, Anthony Hopkins is still dazzling as Lecter, Julianne Moore was a terrific replacement as Starling and Gary Oldman is unrecogniseable as Mason Verger, it had a great set up and big talent behind it, and with Ridley Scott directing it seemed like a sure thing, but it all comes down to the script, and I think this film is poorly written, it tries too hard to be bigger and better than its predecessor and it wants to disturb its viewers too much. It certainly has its moments and the performances are great, but Hannibal is ultimately a huge disappointment that I could not recommend unless you want to see the whole film series.

42,A_Different_Drummer,Like Hannibal himself ... ill-conceived and twisted...,5,29 March 2014,"Not so much a movie as a corporate offensive with the single goal of (what else) milking a franchise literally ... to death. OMG. Look at the talent in front of, and behind, the camera. Seriously. There are enough big names here to start another Hollywood. Ridley Scott, at a stage in his career (before Prometheus, for example) when his name was essentially a brand of its own. Screenplay by Mamet? How often does THAT happen? You have to believe that, to hook him into this project, a convoy of Brinks trucks carrying large, non-sequential, bills was somehow involved. Gary Oldman, one of the most accomplished character actors of all time. And of course they could not do the film without bringing back Sir Anthony, again, one of the greatest actors of the era, and at a stage in his career when his name as well was virtually a guarantee of quality (before the Odin-sleep, for example). What could go wrong?Here is what went wrong: 1. They could not get Jodie Foster to do the part. This reviewer is incredibly naive, a genetic issue, and would like to think it was because her ""Spidey sense"" warned her of what was come, but more likely it was a about money. Instead, viewers were ""Bewitched"" (a reference to the way they swapped out the husband in the iconic TB show) and had to make do with Julianne Moore, a middling actress who, never, not even on her best day, captured the gravitas of Foster. 2. Hopkins was getting a bit old to play Hannibal, mid-60s by now, but to his credit he did handle himself remarkably well, and moved with the grace of a younger man. 3. The big error, the one that will go down in the history books, the one that will be taught in Film Schools of the future, is the ending. They did not simply change it. They butchered it. Almost as if Hollywood itself was saying to the book industry, look pal, you are toast, we have seen the future and it is all about portable devices, Google glasses, and electronic media. No one reads anymore. If we change the ending, who will know...?Well this reviewer, for one. In the book, Hardy, a strange writer who likes challenging his readers, suddenly decided that Starling and Hannibal were meant for each other, like Fred and Ginger, and had them hook up at the close, and toddle off into the sunset. NOT MAKING THIS UP, READ THE BOOK. This was too much for a Hollywood production team who first and foremost wanted to make back the money they had advanced for the aforesaid Scott, Mamet, Hopkins and Oldman. So they basically filmed a different movie.Which explains the low rating, and the sad feeling most fans of the original (Silence of the Lambs) get whenever you mention this sequel.",Hannibal
43,CuriosityKilledShawn,Good Eating or Bad Movie?,3,5 April 2001,"Despite the fact that most readers will instantly disagree with me I will begin with stating that I did not like The Silence of the Lambs and I just do not get the adoration. To me it's a mundane, overrated bore with telegraphed irony and deus ex plotting.My hopes for Hannibal were low, and still I was disappointed. People tend to forget that up until the success of Gladiator Ridley Scott's career was on a steep downward trajectory as the 90s had not been kind to him. I don't think the man deserves his ""legendary"" status as a director and Hannibal is proof that he sometimes has no idea what to do with material, however poor. The substance is lacking, and so is his style.With Lecter free to roam the world enjoying his fiendish life to the fullest he assumes the identity of Dr. Fell a library curator in Florence. His foil, Clarice Starling, meanwhile is in trouble with her bosses after a botched stakeout ends in multiple deaths. Hideously disfigured pederast Mason Verger uses his family's wealth and power to have Clarice reassigned to Lecter's case and plans an epic revenge on the cannibal. As this plot slowly, slowly, slo-owly builds a charisma-free detective in Florence tries to apprehend Lecter for himself and claim the big reward.There is zero tension, no atmosphere, and little in the way of danger or threat. It's fun seeing Lecter do his thing, but there's hardly of it. Florence is shot and lit in such a flat and dull way that it really could have been Scunthorpe or a rough area of Glasgow. Scott hardly ever shoots flat, but I really do think that a 2.35:1 anamorphic aspect ratio and a different cinematographer would have made a world of difference, as well as trimming a few useless minutes here and there.It's obvious that no one involved in making this movie had any real clue what to do with the material. Outside of a few amusingly disturbing moments, Hannibal has no bite.",Hannibal

Moore and Gary Oldman are very convincing, Giancarlo Giannini has the most likable role in the movie and Hopkins is simply perfect as he always is. The only downside is Ray Liotta. He looks like he wandered into this story by mistake. He's not a bad actor, but he simply does not fit in with the others or in this type of movie. Also, this movie has several scenes that engrave into your brain forever. Hopkins and Giannini on the balcony, boar's jaw enclosing, dinner scene, and kiss-cuffs-chopping grand finale.

46,jacobjohntaylor1,All hype and no scary.,3,5 June 2015,This is the third Hannibal movie the fist one was Man hunter made in 1986. It had a remake that was more popular Red dragon. Man hunter is a very scary movie. And this one is just overrated crap. Red dragon was a great deal better. Red dragon is one of the scariest movies ever. And this one is just pooh pooh. The prequel Hannibal rising is better and that one is not very good. For a movie that was said to be scarier then A nightmare on elm street 2 Freddy's revenge and Friday the 13th 2 I was very disappointed. This not a scary movie. It has a week script. It as good actors. They just wasted there talent. The best thing about this movie is that it is a precursor to Red dragon. This movie is not scary and it has an awful ending. Don't see this movie. It is a wast of time and money. It is not scary. It is just stupid.,Hannibal

48,Rodrigo_Amaro,Not as good as it could have been but still very good,8,8 July 2012,"The first time I've seen ""Hannibal"" I was horrified with what I've just seen, felt cheated, hugely disappointed and the only thought on my head was that they've ruined everything, and it was the worst sequel ever given to a huge success. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is the prime example of a well-built thriller, with horrific elements and it's crafty, intelligent, disturbing and fascinating, all in one package and to me seeing the following film with high hopes of getting something similar was the rule. It ended and I told everybody I knew of how awful I thought it was. But time heals everything or almost everything and I decided to give another ride and it turned out for the best. Again, it's still inferior to what Jonathan Demme's created with perfection.""Hannibal"" goes ten years later from the first film when Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore, replacing Jodie Foster) has the chance to rebuilt her career (after a disastrous task force operation that killed several people) when an old victim of Hannibal Lecter's atrocities claims to have new information on him. The victim is the millionaire Mason Verger (played by an unrecognizable and uncredited Gary Oldman) is the only survivor of Hannibal's ferocious attacks (a goof from the film, those who watched TSOTL know that he attacked a nurse who also survived but lost one eye and part of her face and the most incredible is that this film recreates such scene but they still keep mentioning that Verger is the only survivor) who uses Clarice as a bait to catch Lecter and he has a scary plan of revenge waiting to be used on the doctor. Parallel to those events we have an Italian inspector (Giancarlo Giannini) who is suspicious of a respectable figure that we audience know is Lecter, and the rest I'll leave it open to you.On the words of Jodie Foster, who turned down the offer of being in it, this movie isn't about saving lives which ""Silence"" was and that's why she was part of it. ""Hannibal"" is about showing the human being in its worst conditions by seeking blood, revenge, money, lust and with no chance of redemption. It's all about getting ahead of something, chasing what he or she wants and feel good about it. And once again Hannibal can play both bad guy and the good guy and more layers of his personality are shown when we see his attack on Verger. Crushing our senses with gory sequences but barely making us thrilled or deeply interested like Demme's film ""Hannibal"" has tiny bits of audacity, surprise and intelligence, sadly intertwined with the grotesque, appealing to mass audiences. The plot isn't great like it should have been considering the predecessor Oscar winning film and even with screenwriters like Steven Zaillian (""Schindler's List"") and David Mamet (""The Untouchables) they couldn't make something decent of their credits. The dialogs aren't memorable or eloquent like Ted Tally's amazing script (he returned in the franchise with ""Red Dragon"", great!). Walks off with gripping scenes like the inspector's tragic fate; the pigeons forming Hannibal's face in the Piazza; the sequence in the shopping mall or Clarice and Lecter meeting in the final moments; and the notorious brain eating scene.Ridley Scott's name as director of this is a mere formality to gather good box-office, he's just here because Demme turned down the script given to him and because he was contracted for it, it's not an author's project and it's clearly visible that his direction here wasn't so great. It's too mechanical, contrived, faulty. As for acting Hopkins lost the touch a little but he's still the best Lecter that there is (Brian Cox in ""Manhunter"" is good while Gaspard Ulliel as the young Hannibal shows some variations of what the man used to be, quite decent); Moore is a good choice for the irreplaceable Foster, she worked hard, but we still can forget the unbeatable first film; Oldman is fully hidden behind the makeup, and the almost inaudible voice, but he's the best of the main cast playing an invalid character that holds plenty of power and evilness that is beyond belief for someone who is almost a living dead. But the best acting in the movie goes to Frankie Faison returning as Barney, revealing some secrets of his relation with Lecter. His scene is probably one of the greatest in the whole thing.With some missing parts on the puzzle and a losing' end that almost went nowhere ""Hannibal"" manages to be a good film more for its entertainment values than for its intellectual values. Sometimes it's all we need. 8/10",Hannibal
49,zkonedog,"Something Is Just ""Off"" About This Sequel",3,9 March 2017,"""Silence of the Lambs"", the movie from which ""Hannibal"" is spawned, was an exercise in creepiness from beginning to end. The scenes with Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins are almost alive with tension, while the overall plot is well-executed and creepy enough to make you legitimately ""weird-ed out"" on more than one occasion. Sadly, this sequel fails to live up to any of those previous benchmarks.For a basic plot summary, ""Hannibal"" sees Clarice Starling (now played by Julianne Moore) as an under-appreciated F.B.I. agent. Out of the blue, Starling is contacted by Mason Verger (Gary Oldman), an old victim of Dr. Lecter, who portends to have some new information regarding the whereabouts of Hannibal (Anthony Hopkins).Though difficult to pinpoint exactly what is wrong with what could have been a blockbuster sequel, I believe it is the combination of ""little things"" that really do this movie in. For instance...-The tension in ""Lambs"" comes from the fact that one can never quite ""figure out"" Hannibal. At times he seems like a civil genius, yet obviously he is also quite twisted psychologically. This produces a sense of fear in the vein of ""what will he do next"". This movie holds none of that intensity, with Hannibal being portrayed as an ""old romantic"" instead of a cutting-edge personality.-The lack of scenes involving both Hannibal & Clarice is also unforgivable. That is where the first movie really succeeds, and here it comes both late and not enough.-Maybe it is the writing, but Foster's Clarice was much more interesting than Moore's doppelganger. Whereas Foster was vulnerable and conflicted, Moore is just ""straight arrow"" with no compromises or shades of grey. Either character would work in the context of the films, but it is the sudden shift between them that makes Moore's performance just seem wrong.-Finally, the ""Buffalo Bill"" main plot line of ""Lambs"" far outshines anything this film has to offer. The visuals of the faceless Verger are striking, for sure, but his character is terribly developed. He is built up to be the ""primary villain"", but I found myself not caring about him whatsoever.In essence, ""Hannibal"" (while not utter, 1-star type trash) is a failure due to the fact that it changes the formula so much from its predecessor. The tension is gone, the interesting characters are gone, and what remains is a lot of police procedure and talking. A shame, considering the potential that was wasted.",Hannibal
50,johnnyboyz,"Slick, but grotesque; somewhat convoluted and overwhelming the first time, but engaging; mesmeric, but uneven – Hannibal is wild but watchable.",6,19 March 2010,"Hannibal is a gloriously looking, truly beautiful film about some grim, truly ugly people. It's a confusing juxtaposition that has torn people between hating it and rather liking it; I myself have seen it three to four times over the years but remarkably, remain in a certain state of not being necessarily too fond of it. Whilst the locations of the Virginian outback and the streets of Florence are shot exquisitely, with a mesmeric soundtrack, most of the characters in Hannibal possess a sense of evil; of wrong-doing; of ugliness, and in two particular male characters of a law-enforcing nature, they can possess these attributes whilst maintaining an outer shell of rugged handsomeness. This, as the photogenic female lead has to deal with a public shaming following a chaotic opening gunfight, as inner-demons threaten to feast away at her. The film is one-part chase thriller as the titular character remains constantly on the run; one-part journey of redemption; one-part detective thriller as one man goes it alone in tracking someone down and one-part revenge tale.But there is that sense of pantomime, or melodrama, when Anthony Hopkins' legendary screen character Dr. Hannibal Lecter is revealed as a physical presence for the first time; he turns to face us, the perspective is just to the side of the character of Renaldo Pazzi (Giannini), an Italian police officer, and there is that overly dramatic sense in us knowing who he is but the hapless supporting character not. This is all just before it is revealed Lecter is gunning for a job as a sort of curator at a centuries old library in Florence, and that his predecessor has mysteriously vanished only recently. To a degree, it all sort of works in its own odd little screwball way. Both Harris' 1999 book and this 2001 adaptation seem to warm to the character of Lecter without embracing him, and in titling the film 'Hannibal', the piece moves away from other series titles such as Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs; two headings that were linked to both the plight and internal difficulties of the serial killing antagonist The Tooth Fairy and lead Clarice Starling, respectively.Clarice Starling is indeed back but is played by Julianne Moore, who does a relatively fine job. Curiously, rather than distance itself from 1991's popular and vastly acknowledged work of brilliance The Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal makes the curious decision to evoke immediate, somewhat nostalgic, memories of said film in having Starling play back all the old tapes from when she interviewed Lecter. It's an odd reference to the previous film, an early 'getting out of the way' if you like of texts of old. But there's a sense that the film has its own identity anyway, and eventually comes across as being split into two distinct halves; a sequence, of which, at the beginning of the second half that sees Lecter chased around by some mercenaries employed by disgruntled past-Lecter victim Mason Verger (Oldman). They have it in mind to capture him so that Verger may wreck a horrid revenge, and it's an important sequence, a shifting of power as to where the film's chief levels of antagonism will arise. Previously, Verger was rendered deformed after an altercation with Lecter many years ago; in the process made to look a freak on the outside and just as ugly as on the inside when it arises he had engaged in prior acts of paedophilia, but is now mostly confined to a wheelchair; further still trapped within his huge manner house and vast acres of land.The multi-strand approach initially sees Lecter based in Italy, giving away his whereabouts following the sending of a letter to Clarice, who is going through her own crisis of confidence with the F.B.I. following a market place shoot out in which an agent is killed. Starling is again struggling with the sexual advances that come with working within the male dominated world in which she operates, with the film making a point as to capture fellow agent Paul Krendler's (Liotta) glances at her in a meeting very early on while later; his physical position within the room they are talking sees him sit himself on a desk, thus looming over a sitting Starling when criticising those of Lecter's kind in that they have a taste for items of a high art nature and therefore are bound to be somewhat strange.For the best part, the film is a Florence-set pot boiler revolving around Pazzi's attempts at dealing with Lecter who's operating under a pseudonym. The very gradual realisation and plan of action Pazzi puts into operation in capturing Lecter is constructed nicely, director Scott applying a fair amount of menace in having Lecter come across as someone whom may or may not know of Pazzi's plan. Scott additionally applies a variety of long shots at the most heightened of times; a telephone call to the F.B.I. ends with a shot of an entire plaza and that uneasy, mystical sense that someone may by out there amongst the array of busy bodies, observing what he's done; indeed heard the entire conversation if that were at all possible. There's a certain disturbing poetry to most of Lecter's murders in Hannibal, in that each victim evicts some sort of sinful tendency in their aims prior to their demise; be it lust, wrath or greed. It's easier to associate oneself with Lecter in the film as this wondering, loose serial killer but in making those around Lecter so unrelatable, the film rather brilliantly avoids rendering Lecter neither a romanticised figure nor someone we ought to feel natural affection toward. The film is uneven in tone, and pulls out the sort of gross content that sees it severely clash with most of its overall look, but as a pulpy tale of a killer on the loose; a vengeful past victim and a righteous detective on the hunt, Hannibal just about makes the grade.",Hannibal
51,filipemanuelneto,The return of the cannibal was lighter than expected,5,1 August 2016,"This film is a sequel to ""Silence of the Lambs"": This time, Hanibal will need the agent Clarice Starling to get rid of a powerful enemy. Directed by Ridley Scott and written by David Mamet, this film has a cast headed by Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore.Its one of the most interesting thrillers of the decade and brings again to the big screen the iconic Hannibal Lecter. However, there is no love like the first and, so, this film is never able to rub shoulders with its predecessor, despite the remarkable quality it has. It's a good movie, entertains the audience, leaving them quite uncomfortable and causing some chills especially in the stronger scenes. This is also a warning for sensitive people: this film has several shocking scenes.The script is quite reasonable but its very predictable and only heats in the end, in the only scenes which can create real tension, in which the public is in anticipation of what will happen. Julianne Moore looks like it hasn't adapted to the role of Starling. The work of the actress is cold and devoid of depth. However, I don't know if that was a casting error or a writing error. The special, visual and sound effects, although discrete, are competent. The makeup also deserves congratulations, especially because of the appearance of the character Mason Verger and some more shocking scenes, where the skillful hand of the makeup artist was valuable. The soundtrack, by Hans Zimmer, is also very good and fits perfectly to the film, making it much more dense than it really is.In short, its a good movie, despite failures. Its worth seeing it, mainly for the pleasure of reviewing Anthony Hopkins, again in one of the most famous roles of his career. Unsurpassed, the actor gives the necessary support to the film.

The movie does not centers around another crime to be solved, instead it focuses on the intense relationship between Lecter and Clarice.But this time around there isn't a deep interesting plot, the movie focuses mainly on violence and Lecter's violent conduct. But the character exploration is pretty interesting and should please Hannibal fans.The acting is pretty good; Hopkins OWNS the character while Julianne Moore is extremely solid. Gary Oldman shins as always although we don't see his face that much...you know what I mean.There are disturbing moments that should be remembered for the high violence and gore content but actually fit well in the movie.I recommend this movie only for fans of the Hannibal Lecter character or for those who enjoyed ""Silence of the Lambs"".

57,Anonymous_Maxine,"Of COURSE it wasn't as good as the sequel, what did you expect?",9,7 August 2001,"Obviously, as the sequel to a stunning Best Picture winner, Hannibal has a lot to live up to. In it's defense, the movie takes up that task with fervor and skill. Anthony Hopkins, as is to have been expecting, delivers another spectacular performance in one of his most memorable roles, Gary Oldman portrays Mason Verger, the film's unfortunate protagonist, with appreciable malice and non-appeal, and even Julianne Moore manages to successfully fill the shoes of Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling. The Silence of the Lambs is one of the greatest thrillers ever made, in my opinion, so I was dedicated to that film's performers when I walked in to see Hannibal, and I was still impressed with how well Julianne Moore performed for the role.The magnitude Anthony Hopkins's performance, as a matter of fact, is accented by the character of Hannibal as he is seen throughout the three films in which the character can be found. In Manhunter (the mediocre film based on Thomas Harris's spectacular novel, Red Dragon), Hannibal is little more than an interesting extra with a few spoken lines. He helps Will Graham along periodically in his efforts to catch the troubled `Tooth Fairy,' but he is little more than a side character in the film. In The Silence of the Lambs, Dr. Lecter plays much the same role, helping Clarice Starling this time as she hunts down a man who kills large women and takes their skins. There can be no mistake about Hannibal's magnified presence in The Silence of the Lambs as compared to Manhunter, and then this year they come out with a film based entirely on his character, and they do, in fact, name the film after him. Do you think Harris would have written a novel based on the character if Brian Cox had played Dr. Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs? I can't help doubting it. The story of Hannibal follows the now-disgraced Starling (due to a publicized FBI raid that was easily manipulated to make Starling look bad), as she travels Europe in pursuit of the evasive Dr. Lecter. After his escape in The Silence of the Lambs, he traveled to Italy to hide, but even more, so that he could pursue his vastly intellectual interests. Hannibal is unmistakably gorier than The Silence of the Lambs, but that's clearly because the film follows Hannibal Lecter as its main character. In previous films, we mainly only heard stories through the dialogue of Dr. Lecter's crimes, but here we actually see them. You can't really hold this against the film as gratuitous violence, because it is a movie about the character that was so popular back in 1991. They're just giving us more of what we want and I, for one, thank them for it. One of the most important things about movies that are made from novels is how faithful it remains to the original work. Movies like The Green Mile and Stand By Me are incredibly faithful, and with excellent results, and Hannibal also remains faithful to the original novel in the most important places. The story is necessarily condensed for the film version, but the film does not take giant liberties from the text, which is something that is sometimes done and almost always deteriorates the quality of the story. This type of destructive behavior can be seen in Manhunter, for one example, and also in classics (who would think they had any right to change these?) like Jonathan Swift's `Gulliver's Travels' and Mary Shelley's `Frankenstein.'The one part where Hannibal deviated from the novel most noticeably was the ending. Many people (including myself) were disappointed that the film ended in almost exactly the same way that The Silence of the Lambs ended, but you should have seen the ridiculous ending that Thomas Harris put in the book! What a mess! The movie may not have had the best ending in the world, but it's all uphill from the pitfall that can be found at the end of Harris's novel. For the most part, Thomas Harris has brought us an interesting story for Hannibal, and the film succeeds on most levels in delivering it to (unfortunately) the vast majority of the public  meaning the people who will never bother to read the book. It's amazing how well they managed to switch the roles of protagonist and antagonist here. We find ourselves rooting for the bad' guy (Hannibal, who has horribly murdered several people), and hoping that he will kill the good' guy, who is one of Hannibal's previous victims, but who now plans to viciously murder Hannibal for revenge. Sure, the movie may have seemed excessively gory or unpleasant at times, but that's what kind of movie it is, all of that stuff fits with the story and the characters. We're dealing with a pure sociopath as the film's protagonist, so obviously there is going to be some violence. It is no secret that Hannibal is not on the same level with The Silence of the Lambs, but that is to be expected. But despite all of the astronomical expectations and other odds against it, Hannibal manages to be a very good thriller.",Hannibal
58,jzappa,A Disclosure of All That Had Mystique In Its Predecessor,9,28 October 2008,"We must give credit to Ridley Scott's sequel to the matchless original Jonathan Demme film for the audacity of its wickedness. The Silence of the Lambs was a masterwork because it was fundamentally a character-driven drama that, in part by means of its medium as a police procedural, organically unfolded into gruesome territory. Hannibal is a disclosure of all that was mystique in its predecessor, such as that it is stomach-turning in its barefaced depictions of horrific brutality, comparable to mondo-style exposure of expired anatomy, soaked in blood, guts, brains and screams of inconceivable agony. As a high-tech police procedural as well, one that opens with a bloody shootout between Washington, D.C. police and vicious drug dealers with submachine guns, it is truly a merging of two cinematic worlds. This is what makes Ridley Scott's Hannibal so entertaining as a movie.For example, there is an FBI team of scent specialists. When Clarice obtains a letter from Hannibal conveying sympathy for the disastrous drug bust, the result of which was the shootout, but also jeering her into tracking him down, this sophisticated team finds that he was very prudent not to leave anything on the letter that could impart a trace to his whereabouts, but it is also covered with some distinct brand of perfume which is sold in a very small number of shops all over the world. What a way to merge the unabashed double- tasking brilliance of the title character with such technically evasive criminal bureaucracy.Taking the place of Jodie Foster is Julianne Moore as FBI agent Clarice Starling. We do not miss Foster so much as we miss her portrayal of Clarice as a naïve, eager and guarded cadet, but that is actually a plus for this film. Julianne Moore's Clarice is by now very seasoned, more pessimistic, having been through an overwhelming lot in the ten years since we met her as the ambitious idealist running from childhood memories. Now, she holds the record of having killed more people than any other female FBI agent. The twisted antagonist, Mason Verger, is played with vile drip by an unrecognizable star. Screw it, it's Gary Oldman. We all know now anyway. The key to this element of the story and of the Hannibal character is that any arch enemy of his can only be several times more degenerate. It could never be the other way around.Yet, it is Verger who is bedridden from paralysis in the hospital wing of his mansion. It is he who is nourished intravenously. His surviving eye is watered by a salty drip as a replacement for actual tears. He can move in a motorized wheelchair after being hoisted into it by brawny entourage and his abused doctor Cordell. He is enveloped by specialists and underlings to help him in a variety of fashions, and uses them to hunt down his long-standing adversary. He has formed a website offering a $3 million reward for the location of Lecter, with a Swiss bank as his go-between.When I said before that this film discloses all that had mystique in the previous movie, I also meant in a more pivotal sense its title character. On one hand, we are unnerved by Hannibal's air of mystery because the most perfect portrayal of a villain of which we should all admit we can possibly think was in the predecessor, wherein only his mind was free to journey and pierce being incarcerated behind the impenetrable glass of his subterranean vault-like cell, and that was more than enough. It was so incredible how capable he was and how almost nightmarish it was to be in his unruffled, elegant presence that we felt it was a wonder that there was any way he could be incarcerated, that he could somehow transcend the obstacle of physical captivity. Now Lecter moves freely, and though we cannot help but be riveted by whatever we can get of him, that detaches part of the fascination. In any case, Hannibal, as an intellectual force to be reckoned with, has not lost so much impact as to be ruined and rather than his charm being diminished, we feel that it is now a terror to be within his now unforeseeable proximity. There is still, especially since by the time of this film's release Hannibal was a cult icon, that morbid sense of humor fulfilled when he first appears. In this case, it is when Giancarlo Giannini, who plays an Italian detective, is investigating the disappearance of a library curator, and meets his ""replacement,"" who is none other thanScott's ultra-modern visual style, as it tends to in his latter work, runs out of steam in certain spots, capturing stylistic coverage more than using camera and editing language as, for instance, Demme did, but we can tell the scenes of dialogue written by David Mamet, the Mason Verger villain character is a first-class fusion of talent and devilish imagination, Julianne Moore's Clarice is a realistic depiction of how a person in her shoes would have changed in a decade, Ray Liotta gives a persuasively degenerate performance as the sleazy and corrupt Department of Justice employee who disgraces Clarice, and though Anthony Hopkins makes Lecter enthralling every second he is on the screen, he hardly needs to. The character speaks for himself.",Hannibal
59,videorama-759-859391,"Great or perfect sequel, to the real gorehound conisseur, which is the psycho genius himself",8,11 May 2014,"A long time in the waiting, this sequel, despite a lot of negative reviews is well worth it. While letting Hannibal cramp our comfort, like getting to close for comfort in a few scenes from his predecessor, here he is uncaged, let loose, where we really learn what this brilliant psychopath is capable of, violence wise, and here it's a fear that runs much deeper than Silence Of The Lambs, and we got the violence factor to show for it. How they even gave Hannibal an MA rating in the first place, escapes me. Seriously the censor board ought to be shot. The scenes involving heavy face disfigurement, body mutilations, disembowellments, flying intestines, whatever, plus the infamous brain scene near it's finale, warrants real strong stomach stuff, the higher bar of violence which has been set here, almost coming off as stylistic, suiting the whole air of the film. Check out the cover for starters. A poster design couldn't of been more better suited. The Silence Of The Lambs, was scary, but Hannibal is bloody terrifying, and that I got that air, prefore to going into to see this with my dad. I knew what I was letting myself in for, and like a great tasting dish, I was very much if scarily appeased, if not daring to ask for more. Julianne Moore, who I think is a great actress, can't really replace Clarice Starling, but she still does one hell of a job. She's just not as good, although I liked Moore's interpretation. Oldman who sets acting standards so high, is fantastic as usual, as a rich, perverted slug, Mason Verger who got what he deserved. He's sent a contract out to kill Hannibal, responsible for his grotesque, facial deformity, while getting sozzled one night with the cannibalistic maniac. Oldman's character is repellent. He's into little boys, one scene involving pigs sickened me. An incapacitated Verger, so filled with revenge, enlists Moore to track him down, where of course, nastier plans are set for her. She clashes with an old FBI nemesis, Paul Krendler (a solid Liotta) after an unrelated sting operation goes horribly wrong, and the young wanted assailant dies, clutching her surviving infant in her arms. Liotta's sour history with her had him trying to crack onto her, but remember, our hot shot Clarice, doesn't get involved. Krendler's nastier true colors come to surface later on, where Hannibal is there to right those wrongs, especially at dinner. Notably the brain scene look shockingly awesome and inappropriate to the viewer as a special din din has been prepared by Hannibal for him and his other much specialer guest. We have a sub plot with French cop who makes Hannibal, and with a big reward on offer, sometimes the price of knowledge can be fatal. I loved how this sequel has come, it maintains a high level of terror and suspense, throughout, not like the remade prequel, Red Dragon, which was to follow, a later, unwarranted. You really know you're about to go in, if unconsciously apprehensive of it, to see some something that will really make those hairs on your wrist stand, or get that heart pumping, and on the big screen, that is exactly what you get, proving, Ridley Scott, like his late brother Tony, god rest his soul, are only capable of making hits. As for Hopkins, he was much more scary, caged, behind those bars, those ten years back, with those beady eyes, drilling into yours. He hasn't lost that menace, but like I said, he's scary because we know what he's capable of, and here he's about to really show us how much.",Hannibal
60,Vartiainen,"Not the best possible sequel, but it serves",8,11 September 2015,"Some years have passed since the events of The Silence of the Lambs and Dr. Hannibal Lecter has been laying low, hiding from the long arms of the FBI and those that he has hurt in the past. Likewise Clarice Starling, played this time by Julianne Moore, has moved on, but now she has been disgraced by a drug bust gone wrong and thus it is time for these two old enemies to meet once more.Hannibal is a serviceable sequel in the Hannibal Lecter trilogy. They got Anthony Hopkins to reprise his role, which automatically makes the film worth checking out, and it is very interesting to see him on the loose, mixing with the high society, in his natural element so to speak. Lecter is still easily the best thing about these films, and Hopkins's suave menace has not gone down in the slightest.It's a shame they couldn't get Jodie Foster to reprise her role as well, but Julianne Moore is an okay substitute as a leaner and meaner Clarice. Plus, as a compensation gift, we get Gary Oldman as Mason Verger, the only one of Lecter's victims who lived through his ordeals. Very good role for him and he absolutely delivers.What doesn't work so well, unfortunately, is the story. Especially the fact that this time there is no battle of wits, like there was in the original or in the upcoming Red Dragon. Clarice and Hannibal don't face each other nearly as much as they did in The Silence of the Lambs and anyone else in the film is nowhere near their equal. Plus the whole tone of the film is more of an action thriller, which is an ill fit for these characters. It doesn't ruin the film, per se, but it is a problem, at least for me.Still, it's worth checking out if you liked the original, but don't expect it to be as good.",Hannibal
61,gwnightscream,Favorite Hannibal Film!,7,28 February 2012,"Anthony Hopkins, Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman, Ray Liotta, Giancarlo Giannini and Frankie Faison star in Ridley Scott's 2001 thriller sequel based on Thomas Harris' novel. This takes place 10 years after the events of ""Silence of the Lambs"" and begins with an FBI operation led by agent, Clarice Starling (Moore). After it ends in a massive shootout, Clarice is contacted by sociopath, Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins) from Florence, Italy. He's been traveling the world and currently working in Florence as a phony history professor. Meanwhile, a wealthy man, Mason Verger (Oldman) who is one of Hannibal's victims, exacts revenge on him for disfiguring his face. Liotta (Goodfellas) plays Justice Department Lawyer, Paul Krendler who dislikes Clarice and tries to get her suspended out of the bureau by getting involved with Mason's plan. Giannini (Casino Royale) plays Police Inspector, Rinaldo Pazzi who tries to capture Hannibal and Faison (Manhunter) reprises his role as Hannibal's former orderly, Barney. This is my favorite Hannibal film, I like how he's out and about, Anthony and Julianne are great in it and Hans Zimmer's score is excellent as usual. I recommend this.",Hannibal
62,FiendishDramaturgy,Nothing above mediocre.,3,19 October 2003,"This is a sad, multi-million-dollar extravaganza of Ridley Scott and his poorest exhibition of standard Hollywood fare.With a budget of $87 million, you would think ... or rather, hope ... that more could be done to further the masterpiece of the original, ""Silence of the Lambs."" Unfortunately, the subject of Starling's focus this time is first, a grossly disfigured surviving victim of Lecter's savagery, with only a secondary, almost off-handed half-glance of attention at Lecter himself. I found the climaxial scene featuring Ray Liota's...thoughts...to be among the most disgusting piece of cinema I've ever witnessed. What was the point of that? With ""Silence of the Lambs,"" we were handed a creative, crafty, intellectual masterpiece of psychological theater. With ""Hannibal,"" we are force-fed pure and absolute Hollywood Eye Candy without even the merest drop of water with which to wash it down.The psychological aspect is still present, but Julianne Moore's reprisal of Jodie Foster's original role as Clarice Starling did absolutely nothing for this production. I found her portrayal to be shallow and plastic as a Barbie doll which is not anatomically correct. The cinematography in this movie; the sets, the scenery itself, was far superior, but the plot was just gods-awful. Had Mr. Scott spared us the mind-expanding scene with Ray Liota, it may have been a much better finished product, but with the inclusion of that scene I found it about two steps above ""Killer Clowns from Outer Space."" It took away from the suspense and beauty of Lecter's sickness so much that it rendered the entire film as unenjoyable, to me.Without those three elements: Moore, the Liota scene, and the horrid little troll of a client; this would have been a top notch production. But the disgusting visuals, to me, robbed this work of its potential for beauty and elegance. If you loved the original for its psychological edge and eloquence of plot, then this movie will be a horrible disappointment. If you did not like it for the absence of gore, then this movie will make you a happy audience member. As a sequel, it is a mere shell of the original masterpiece. As a stand alone movie, it falls flat on its face. In comparison to the original, it is a sorry, slip-shod production which does not even rate the label of ""sequel.""I suggest ""Red Dragon,"" and ""Silence of the Lambs,"" even ""Manhunter"" (not one of my favorites), but do yourself a favor and skip this one.All in all, this movie rates somewhere around a 3.1/10 from...the Fiend :.",Hannibal
63,elshikh4,Sophisticated Idiocy !,1,6 March 2013,"I hate vanity, stupidity, blood, complexity, pointlessness, and bore. And it happens to be that this movie contains ALL OF THE ABOVE!So the first movie, (The Silence of the Lambs - 1991), was a success. It was thrilling and psychological, being exciting and deep; which's the equation of perfect entertainment in my book. It won the Oscar, the box office, and led to a wave of similar movies. Sure in all the 1990s next serial killers horror thrillers, you'll find something, if not many things, affected by this movie. According to that, I wondered how they didn't make the sequel earlier?! Though, according to the sequel itself, (Hannibal - 2001), I lamented why it was made in the first place!First of all, the structure of the movie as a thriller wasn't any unique or that thrilling. For the first, really weary, 2 thirds; we follow the attempt of idiot inspector to capture the title character; which you know by heart that it will end with the inspector murdered or eaten, and we watch (Clarice) doing nothing but reading, reviewing photos and talking in phones. In the final third, you'll not find great chase, hot sequence or worthy climax. So, where's the excitement then?!Moreover, the script assembles a long list of idiot deeds, then the direction plays them with great confidence. Therefore the final picture is a mix of idiocy and vanity; which's a very very bad mix if you asked me! For little instances: The character of (Mason Verger) is in a wheel chair. Why? Ahh, it's told in the book, which this movie is based on, that (Lecter) broke his neck with a noose. So why our movie didn't show that, or even refer to it by a line?! (Clarice) is living with someone. Who is that? The movie doesn't answer. (Clarice) is framed for forcing her to leave the case, but with what? Something that was never clearly explained (with a mention of Palestinians!). (Verger) hired people to raise wild boars for him. OK. So why they make him hear their voices with recorded human screams?! Someone is killed right in the street, between tens of people, and nobody notices. And the most comic; while (Lecter) knows that he became one of the 10 most wanted men on the planet, he lives in Europe WITHOUT ANY DISGUISE WHATSOEVER??!!Then to another crime: The dialogue. It was so sophisticated for its own good. While I'm a scriptwriter, short stories' writer, and a book worm myself; I didn't understand a thing! With the endless lectures about (Dante), (Verger)'s talk about ""How Clarice shies when the name of god is mentioned"", (Lecter)'s reiterative theory about (Clarice) as a dove (!), and (Lecter)'s long totally incomprehensible chatter on the phone; especially the part of ""You're cold, warm, cold"" (?!)--I got dizzy and board. It thinks itself so profound, inspiring or symbolic, while it ends up as purely factitious nonsense. It's whether something that needs a dictionary, and the best code breaker you can find!, or a mess of ramified high talking. Both ways, it gives the headache, with no paying off!Originally, what was the movie's point? That child molesters and bribed police officers are worse than crazy cannibals and serial killers?! Well, I beg to differ! Why (Lecter) was having an infatuation over (Clarice)? It's a shame that this movie which builds itself on this question doesn't answer it appropriately. And I missed what was the fact of the relationship between (Lecter) and (Clarice) eventually; is it a love story?! HOW??!! Now losing your point is even bigger shame for you, movie!There are horrible images along the way. Some of them were given freely I think; like the photos at (Clarice)'s office. Then, why to show the grisly face of (Verger) over and over again, in full lighting and close-ups, while the effect can be more scary in the dark, with less appearances for his face?! And to top everything; I must mention the unforgettable scene in which (Lecter) gets (Paul Krendler), played by (Ray Liotta), to eat his own brain. This is like horror farce! It did remind me with a scene in one of (Friday the 13th) movies in which a man was killed by pulling his spine out his body, though he was left screaming! As a whole, and with its mentality, (Hannibal) pushed me to believe that it was an exploitation movie, done with big budget and names!Scriptwriters (David Mamet) and (Steven Zaillian), along with director (Ridley Scott), made a movie that drawled and feigned about being a well cultured one, with meanings, or at least good diving into its characters and world, while it's actually an empty horror / thriller. Again, I hate it when a movie is vain. I hate it when a movie is stupid. And I feel incredible hatred when a movie has the 2 marks together; as it is in the case in hand. Now imagine when it wins the box office as well, as it did in 2001, to know what hell I lived after finishing this movie!(Hannibal) isn't enjoyable, in any way. And that's comparing to (The Silence of the Lambs) or (Dude, Where's My Car), or while not comparing it to anything. Maybe I'm stupid viewer. Or maybe this is stupid movie, sophisticatedly stupid one!",Hannibal
64,dfranzen70,Good sequel? Eats me..,4,28 February 2001,"After nine years of waiting, finally the sequel to The Silence of the Lambs is upon us, descending for the masses to devour. The director this time is Ridley Scott, the Moses bringing to us this feast of horror that updates the characters of Special FBI Agent Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter. Gone is Silence director Jonathan Demme and screenwriter Ted Tally and star Jodie Foster, all of whom passed on this adaptation of Thomas Harris' book. Some had better things to do, some objected to the violence in the book-sequel. In any event, the fact that these principles passed is no small item.   Julianne Moore takes on the role of Starling, the then-rookie FBI agent who worked with the serial killer Lecter to trap another killer, named Buffalo Bill. When Hannibal begins, Starling is disgraced in a botched raid and is suspended by her idiot supervisers. Stop me if you've seen this before: Dedicated law-enforcement official plays by the rules and is blamed when someone else ignores their orders. Yep, it's a cliche. While Starling is suspended, she slowly becomes re-involved in the Lecter case, which ended in the last movie with him on a plane to who-knows-where. What's he been up to all these years?   There aren't nearly as many twists and turns in Hannibal as there were in Silence of the Lambs. Oh sure, you might say, but you can't hold up the sequel to the standards of the original. Not entirely, true, but I also can't completely disregard the original, since the sequel plays off it so often.   By now you've heard about the gore factor. By now, some of your friends might have told you what makes the movie so disgustingly gory. I won't go into that here, though, just in case you haven't heard. But I will say this: the gore you see isn't particularly scary, just gross. There's a big difference, and sadly the screenwriters couldn't see it. In the original, and in many truly scary movies, the anticipation was scarier than the reality. You can show me a bloody corpse, sure, but show me our protagonist walking up to that corpse's sarcophagus, step by stealthy step, with no music, just the sounds of her feet on the stones... and I'm scared to death. Silence did this; Hannibal does not. Moore herself is a liability here, too. Sure, any actress would love this role. And sure, if you asked her, Moore would say she didn't think she was replacing Foster, that she doesn't feel the pressure of following an Oscar-winning performance. That's hogwash, of course. And while Foster brought a sort of smoldering naivete to the role, curious but intelligent, solid but wavering in her own humanity, Moore cannot. It's not her fault entirely, though. The character is about as deep as a puddle. She's not surrounded by the finest characters, either. Yes, Anthony Hopkins is great; he should be, it's his role. But Ray Liotta as Starling's RBI tormentor was way, way, way over the top. Remember that disgrace I wrote about earlier? Guess which character plays it off so that Starling's the screwup? Yes, Liotta's Paul. Why? I don't know. Something about Your Bosses Never Believe You - and it looks as if that goes double if you're a female. Never mind if you've put in 10 years as a straight-arrow agent; apparently, even if you do things by the book you're wrong. Goodbye, Father Logic! And the movie is so SLOW! Sometimes it's a good idea to have slow moments, kind of like the anticipation moments in Silence. But this slowness wasn't leading up to anything! There are just minutes of deadening silence in which nothing happens. There was enough boredom in this movie to put an entire preschool of hyperactive kids to sleep for a year. Chess matches had more action.   Silence had both horror and action. It had a robust plot supported by phenomenal performances. Hannibal has an interesting story, but it had at least one superfluous plot. It had no action and very little horror - and that horror was practically spelled out to you before it got there! Scott appears to have no idea how to stage a horror/action film - he was either moving things along incongruosly and incoherently, or he brought them to an immediate inexplicable standstill. Every ounce of excitement that had existed in Silence was completely evaporated. For a movie with such a nice budget and all the backing in the world (not to mention all the great word-of-mouth anticipation), this should have been at least a decent movie. I came out of the theater feeling cheated and underwhelmed.",Hannibal
65,ackstasis,"Very Different From Its Predecessor, But A Great Film, Nonetheless!",8,24 November 2006,"Sir Anthony Hopkins reprised his legendary role of the evil but brilliant Dr. Hannibal Lecter in Ridley Scott's epic thriller, 'Hannibal.' Upon its release, the film met with considerable critical disappointment, most likely because of Scott's differing directorial style. Jonathon Demme's Oscar-winning masterpiece, 'The Silence of the Lambs,' was a taut, gritty horror film; the film's terror derived largely from the sheer rawness of its graphic imagery.With 'Hannibal,' Ridley Scott has instilled into his film much beauty. It, indeed, remains exceedingly violent, but this violence is stylised. As a result, the film fails, in that regard, to terrify the audience as its predecessor so successfully did.But the film succeeds on a different level. It is an in-depth psychological journey into the ""monster"" of Hannibal Lecter. Though omitting Thomas Harris' difficult-to-adapt ending, 'Hannibal' remains loyal to the long-awaited novel of the same name, which met with similar controversy upon publication.The acting performances are quite good. The Hannibal Lecter we meet in the streets of Florence, Italy is understandably very different from the monster we observed at the Baltimore insane asylum years earlier, and Hopkins adjusts his performance suitably. When Jodie Foster refused to reprise her role as FBI agent Clarice Starling, Julianne Moore ('The Hours,' 2002) stepped forward, and she presents us with a hardened and more experienced version of Foster's Oscar-winning character. Giancarlo Giannini ('Man on Fire,' 2004) is brilliant as the corrupt cop determined to claim a reward for Lecter's capture, and Gary Oldman ('Air Force One,' 1997) is exceedingly chilling as the wealthy, facially-disfigured former patient of Lecter who desperately seeks revenge.",Hannibal

67,Chris_Docker,"Dollars, dollars - eat 'em while they're hot!",4,18 February 2001,"Note: this post contains a slight spoiler in the last paragraph - so please don't read if you haven't seen the movie yet.Breaking box office records in its first week of opening wasn't such a great feat when you consider no-one had seen a preview.Whilst deserving an Oscar for ""best scenes of Florence"", Hannibal sadly fails on almost every other level. Anthony Hopkins, playing the pschopathic killer a second time round, does what he can with a part that is badly written this time, whilst Julianne Moore as the FBI agent languishes limply in comparison to her 'Silence if the Lambs' predecessor, Jodie Foster.Director Ridley Scott has never been at his best with thrillers - psychological or otherwise. he is basically visual - whether in the futuristic settings of Blade Runner or Alien, or in the visual delights of Gladiator or even White Squall. Black Rain and Someone to Watch Over Me, his earlier crime thrillers, were quickly forgotten. The only thing that raises Hannibal above them is some professional Hollywood-style photography and the hype created by the earlier, much better, Silence of the Lambs.In 'Lambs' there was a nail-biting psychological tension between Hannibal Lector and agent Starling. Moore plays a far more laid back Starling and the dynamic is little more than a vague attraction between two brilliant minds. It is particularly sad to see two great actors fail to generate any chemistry - something not beyond Scott to give (as he did, for instance, in Thelma and Louise with Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis).The first two hours drag interminably as we watch the paceless detective work waiting for some sort of climax. When the climax comes, it at least keeps us awake, but hardly worth the wait. One scene, with the frying pan, was done better and more entertainingly in the low-budget, anti-establishment Troma movie, Terror Firmer. In Hannibal, we simply get a dose of predictable gore that probably isn't quite enough given that the movie's appeal is forced to rest on it. After making a few good movies, Ridley Scott put to rest any doubts one might have let linger whilst watching Gladiator - dollars now take the leading role and any pretense at artistic endeavour for our money's worth has barely taken a bit part.",Hannibal

69,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,Excellent film which is sometimes very gory,9,17 November 2005,"HANNIBAL, in my opinion, is an excellent film which is sometimes very gory. I thought that Clarice (Julianne Moore) looked very beautiful in all the dressy clothing she wore, especially the fancy, black dress she had on during the time she was at Dr. Lecter's (Anthony Hopkins) house. Also, I really liked the boars that were in the barn towards the end of the movie. They looked really adorable, even though they're wild animals. In addition, if you ask me, the Pazzis (Giancarlo Giannini and Francesca Neri) looked very nice in the attire they wore to the opera. When Clarice yelled, ""F.B.I,"" at the fish market, which is where she confronted Evelda (Hazelle Goodman), I really felt good and smiled. I must say that I absolutely loved the fish market scene! Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that Hopkins and Moore deserve a Golden Globe for their smashing performances as a psychotic serial killer and a disgraced F.B.I. agent. Now, in conclusion, to all you Anthony Hopkins or Julianne Moore fans that have not seen this excellent film which is sometimes very gory, I highly recommend it!

70,Cristi_Ciopron,A comment started with the best intentions,2,22 October 2007,"When people speakor writeor complain about Hannibal,first they state a true thingthat the movie is not extremely good, it is not a masterpiecethey are, of course, entirely right in stating this; but then they state something completely wrong: that, not being a masterpiece, the movie is extremely bad, is rubbish, trash,etc..This is false. Hey, pals, even Ebert's scale has more steps, as a matter of fact it has 7 steps 4 , 3 ½ ,etc.. I believe ""Hannibal"" has at least this one quality: it is thrilling. This is something, for a movie that otherwise sets itself for anything. Some will find its flaws disgusting and disqualifying ;others will find them extremely and involuntarily comic and parody. Some write about it with a kind of amused anger, or with an amused disgust. Tocilescu considers ""Hannibal"" an author movie; an author horror movie. I think Scott tried to make "" Hannibal"" more Italian by giving it this campy ""giallo"" note.The same Tocilescu thinks that ""Hannibal"" it's a horror. It is notnot even in Scott's presumable intentionit's a crap melodrama. (But then again, Tocilescu believes that THIS Scott was the author of The Hunger (1983) !Maybe this says enough about the pal's familiarity with the Gothic ghetto!) Tocilescu liked ""Hannibal"" because it's ornate. It is; ornate crap.It lacks the dimensions, the proportions, the range, the scope; it looks cheaply ,poor and made on a very low budget. One must be a very bad, a very _ungifted directorto make a film this bad, and so bad this way. All the actors are wrong. Hopkins is wrong, but he seems very comfortable with such stupidities ,as if it's his second nature. The FBI damsel is rubbish; but then she always is. She is as rubbish as in ""Psycho"" (another film she did a lot to spoil). Nobody from the cast or crew seems to have enjoyed doing the movie. What is particularly revolting is Scott's attitude towards the subjecthis complete lack of perspicacity of any kind.After all, what makes this movie look so wrong? It is, if this explains anything, the wrong tone. It is the self-complacency. It is the obvious inability of Scott not only of handlingbut of merely seizing its subject and idea. It's the crap content, the cheap mythologizing ,the abuse of prestige, the cheap trick of using brands and labels instead of characters. Lecter is here like JR Ewing in the ""Dallas"" films. ""Hannibal""'s viewers are not shown a character, or at least an interesting mask, or a masque, or a persona, a fitting conventionno.They are shown a label, a brand. This is extremely wrong.But then again, poor Hopkins uttering those banalities about Alighieri ,as for a class of imbecilestoo gain his admission in the Florentine scientific elite --we are suppose to believe that those philology specialists were impressed by the fact that he knew the who's who of Dante's poem ;even worse are though Hopkins' attempts at reciting something in Italianit's not only uglyit is scabrous .The movie has this bizarre campy look, as if it were a ""giallo"" spoofin fact, that's what it is perhapsthe ""giallo""wanna-be version of Lecter's career.I've found particularly repulsive Hopkins' crap Italian accent. The man sounds like an English soccer player after his first week in Italy. It is abhorring. The score is goodyet not for a ""giallo""but it works in the American scenes.I am one of those who believed that Hopkins is a great actor; yet,I am quite amazed by the resignation and mildness with which he accepts so many rather phony parts.An excellent IMDb writer, FilmFlaneur, remarked this characteristic of Hannibalits ugliness.I have first read about Hannibal in Cahiers Du Cinemait was only a very short and periphery notice, a few words about how bad, stupid and ridiculous this movie isthe prestigious CDC thus said that Hannibal is crap, rubbish. It also wrote how bad is for the film the Italian characters speaking English with that useless Italian accent pretending they were speaking Italian.I began this comment intending to rate it positively, to find something in its favor; I see that I mainly accumulated opinions and facts against it. As a matter of fact, I would of liked to be able to say that ""Hannibal"" is to Scott's cinema what The Agony and the Ecstasy is to Reed'sa concession deliberately (I hope) made, a less good movie, a descent into commercialism ,etc.. But I see this is not the case with ""Hannibal"", which is simply crap.",Hannibal
71,davispittman,"A well made thriller, but too gruesome in some places!",8,20 April 2015,"This is an extremely hardcore thriller, Of course telling the continuing story of Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lector. Julianne steps In as Clarice, and in my opinion does a very good job of it! Of course Anthony Hopkins achieved his goal of portraying the terrifying Hannibal Lector. I did have a problem with the last 10 minutes of the film, things got wayy too gruesome and grisly! The filmmakers showed us way too much! Ray liotta did a pretty good job in his role also. Gary Oldman played a horribly deformed former victim of Hannibal Lectors, and gave a commendable performance! This movie really does leave you scared out of your mind, I'll praise it for that. I really did like the movie overall, my only complaint is the EXTREME gore in the last 10 minutes. I'm surprised that didn't earn it an NC-17 for violence and disturbing gore.

I liked Julianne Moore more as Clarice than Jodie Foster(I don't like her very much as actress).Anthony Hopkins was scary ans great once again as Hannibal Lecter.

75,fertilecelluloid,Art-house horror with Euro-style depravity,8,4 December 2005,"Ridley Scott's sequel to ""Silence of The Lambs"", based on the Thomas Harris novel, is a very different fish to its source. ""Hannibal"" is an art-house horror film with some Euro-style depravity.Let's get the script out of the way first -- it's not great. ""Silence"" was tightly constructed. ""Hannibal"" is a series of sequences that aren't knitted together tightly. It's as if David Mamet and the other uncredited writers (there were plenty) were instructed to create a loose foundation on which to hang a cavalcade of perversions.The perversions on display are strong and putrid, and nothing is more putrid than the Mason Verger character, brought to pernicious life by Gary Oldman. Verger is a wealthy pedophile who tangled with Lecter in the past and got his face ripped off. Now on a mission to make Lecter pay, Verger concocts an elaborate scheme to lure Lecter to his mansion and feed him to wild pigs. This sequence, when it finally transpires, is priceless, and worth the admission price.Julianne Moore replaces Jody Foster and does an adequate job of breathing life into the Starling character. Ray Liotta, as a creepy cop, takes his ""Unlawful Entry"" character and pushes him way beyond psychopath level. One of the film's finest scenes sees him become dinner for the discerning serial killer. Hopkins is a more debonair, worldly Lecter this time, a wanted man somehow living an improbable, charmed life on the bohemian fringes of modern Milan.Scott's imagery is glossy and all the sicker for it because the subject reeks so strongly of rotting creative carrion. The score, by a variety of contributors acts as a perfect classical counterpoint to the film's grisly events.Though I'm not sure I like it as much as ""Silence"", I recall its horrors more vividly and warm to its corrupt tone.",Hannibal
76,MarieGabrielle,great and perfect soundtrack....,9,14 March 2008,"And of course, Sir Anthony Hopkins in title role. There is little more to ask for when you need suspense, drama, murder and egocentric villains. This is pure entertainment, and to be honest, I found it superior to ""Silence of the Lambs"".A bit less timid and more slick, but beautiful imagery of Florence, the Duomo, Dante Alighieri's monuments. Dr. Lecter is now a curator at Dante's museum, and intends to garner revenge on Inspector Pazzi (well-portrayed by Marcello Mastroianni). Also a nice cameo with Francesca Neri as his young, desirable wife. Julianne Moore is very good and underplays the role as Clarice Starling except in the scenes with Ray Liotta, as he is a detestable and contemptible bureaucrat.You will feel as if you are in Firenze, and will truly enjoy this prequel. I consider this a do not miss, and hope Mr. Hopkins will again reprise his role as the uncatchable and indomitable Dr. Hannibal Lecter, eminent surgeon and villain. 9/10.",Hannibal
77,Agent10,Nothing special,5,23 July 2002,"With much anticipation, this film proved to be quite a clunker. Little intrigue, even less intelligence, all that had been expended in the original film was lost in this high gleam, little substance film. Sure, Anthony Hopkins was good, but his character was once again overacted, and the cartoonish quality of Lector seemed to make him less scary. One might beg to differ in part due to the final scene, but that is beside the point. Lector's lack of reality makes him less scary and intriguing, and thus this hurts the overall performance. To say the least, everything else in the film was rather blasé and dull. Julianne Moore was rather dull in her role as Clarisse, and Ray Liotta seemed really out of place. The only actor worth mentioning was Gary Oldman, and you couldn't even tell it was him. Overall, a real dud to say the least.",Hannibal
78,rbverhoef,The least interesting,6,4 December 2003,"I have seen all four Hannibal Lecter movies and I have to say that they are all watchable. Unfortunately this one the least of all because the only good reason to see 'Hannibal' is for Anthony Hopkins, but even he is less interesting than in 'The Silence of the Lambs' or 'Red Dragon'. The first movie made, 'Manhunter' (the remake was 'Red Dragon'), was a good thriller and had the advantage that there were no real expectations.But back to 'Hannibal', a movie where Lecter is not imprisoned once and may be that is why some of the fun is missing, the fun that came back with 'Red Dragon'.Or may be it is the fact that there is no real villain. The movie is called 'Hannibal' and he kind of is the real hero, of course together with special agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore). We have Mason Verger (Gary Oldman) who survived Lecter but not without its price. He is searching for Lecter and since he only wants revenge you can't call him a real villain. We have no Buffalo Bill or Tooth Fairy here.Or is it Jullianne Moore who is not as good as Jodie Foster as Clarice? I don't think so. You get used to her in the first act of the movie and she plays how Foster could have done it. May be it is simply the plot that is not as good as 'The Silence of the Lambs'.The movie tries to hide its weak points by putting more gore in it and it gives some scenes that will make this movie definitely not for everyone. That is too bad, and in my opinion not very necessary. because for the fun of Hopkins this movie could be a nice evening for a lot more. I had fun, but not as much as I had with the other Hannibal movies.",Hannibal
79,Samiam3,"Not much of a sequel, but a good movie",7,1 September 2009,"Even though it does not bear an ideal resemblance to silence of the lambs, Ridley Scott's Hannibal is still entertaining in a kind of moody thriller way. Sometimes it's creative sometimes it's clumsy but it abides. Just don't make this a TV dinner movie if your dinner is liver and fava beans.It is four years since last we saw Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter, but circumstance will bring them back together. She finds out that he is on the loose in Venice. The local police chief goes after him seeking the reward money, and one of Lecter's old patients is after seeking revenge for ruining his life and body. Starling has her own reasons for trying to find the world's most extraordinary man-eater. It turns out that Hannibal is seeking Clarice as well. Who will find who first?The film is generally well paced, and engaging, but like so many movies it fails to conclude properly. The last half hour is poorly scripted, clumsy, and not very climatic, although there are some freaky moments.In terms of horror, I think Hannibal is on the same level as its predecessor. Neither movies are actually that scary, but they occasionally reach a fairly high level of disturbing. They are both intriguing movies. This one is a little less so than Silence, but it's a sufficient piece of thriller filmaking.",Hannibal
80,Spleen,If it weren't immoral it would still be pretty dreadful,2,29 July 2001,"""Hannibal"", a truly revolting film, in which all manner of offal is extracted from living people, was less harshly rated in America than ""Showgirls"", which showed pubic hair and nipples.  It's not just America. ""Hannibal"" failed at first to get an R rating in Australia, while the French film ""Romance"" (released around the same time) did not.  There wasn't so much as a drop of blood in ""Romance"", but there WAS sex.  I forget who was responsible for the quip: kiss a tit, and it's R; lop one off with a sword, and it's PG.Actually, the censors have an argument on their side.  People under the age of fourteen or sixteen or whatever should not (so the argument goes) be exposed to EITHER sex and nudity OR violence and gore; but since audiences are more likely to WANT to see soft porn than degrading images of disembowelment, the latter does not require the same degree of vigilance. Market forces alone will limit the amount of disgusting violence in cinemas; government intervention is needed to reign in sex.You'd think so, wouldn't you?  Yet the truth is precisely the opposite. Horrific films make far more money than erotic ones, and - this is almost impossible to believe - it's PARTICULARLY teenaged males who will pay to see them.  Does this worry you?  It should.  About 40% of the footage in Hannibal is such as would put a properly-constituted person off his food, and there is clearly something wrong - perhaps only something mildly wrong, but something wrong nonetheless - with an individual who takes pleasure in seeing such things.What makes ""Hannibal"" particularly disgusting is that the human mutilation is unrelieved by humanity.  There's no warmth or feeling for the characters, as there was in ""Silence of the Lambs"" (which by and large spared us the gruesome images to begin with).  Nor is there anything else to distract us: suspense, comedy, a story, a puzzle, a point of view - and THAT'S what worries me.  This time the spectators really DID come to be titillated by razor-to-the-face violence.  What else was on offer?  If you don't want to see entrails you'll find yourself looking at your watch.  I'll grant that the original film probably generated some interest for its sequel, although anyone who'd seen the original would know that it spoke eloquently for itself and required no sequel; and that the images are what we've come to expect from Ridley Scott: pretty, in a soulless kind of way, and agreeably devoid of meaning and expression.  -At least, I presume there are SOME people who find such emptiness agreeable.Pay no attention to the fact that one of the writers is David Mamet.  What is it with this guy?  Why are his scripts so good when he directs them himself (""The Spanish Prisoner"", ""The Winslow Boy"") and so terrible when someone else does (this tripe, and ""The Untouchables"")?  Is it yet another testament to the incompetence of Ridley Scott and Brian DePalma?  Does Mamet keep his best work for himself?  What's going on?",Hannibal
81,Galina_movie_fan,"""Now *that's* entertainment!""",7,27 November 2006,"I was pleasantly surprised by Ridley Scott's ""Hannibal"" given that the movie is based on the horrible book which I more than dislike. I see a writer as a God - he creates by the power of his imagination the new worlds and populates them with his creatures. Once, he created the world, he should give his characters free will; they should act by the logic of their personalities not by their creator's sheer caprice. What Harris did in ""Hannibal"" is unspeakable - he just showed his fans how much he despised them. Actually, he did two things wrong - the ending and his attempt to explain Hannibal, to look behind the mask. The film comparing to the book has several redeeming values: visually, it is a stunning work of a great director. I am yet to see Florence, the celebrated City of Flowers as dark, dangerous, and anti-tourist as in ""Hannibal"". Second, the movie did not try to ""explain"" Hannibal, to get inside his head and understand him. Harris attempted in the book to give us the reasons why Hannibal was what he was - it was weak and laughable. If he chose to present Hannibal as some sort of supernatural creature with almost animals' instincts, he should've left him as an eternal mystery. The best description of Hannibal belongs to Clarice. When asked, ""Is it true what they're sayin', he's some kinda vampire?"" - she replied, ""They don't have a name for what he is"". And finally, the film avoided the literally vomit-inducing, absurd, irrational, obnoxious slap in face book's ending - for this alone I think ""Hannibal"" is a very decent movie and a lot of fun.7.5/10",Hannibal
82,raulfaust,Great sequence to a flawless classic,8,25 April 2011,"Hannibal is one of the few movie sequences that we like to adore. Of course it is no Silence of The Lambs, but the cast is equally awesome and the story is well developed.Dr. Hannibal Lecter hasn't changed a thing since Lambs. He's the same freak old man starving for human meat. Clarice Starling is well portrayed by the actress Julianne Moore, who makes it perfect believable to the same girl from lambs. Sadly we have to close our eyes to some situations, like Hannibal, a fat tub of lard in his sixties, is completely able to get away with murder in Veneza right after killing Insp. Pazzi.Despite that, the film is very satisfying and there are lots of tense scenes that sticks the spectator to the edge of his seat. 8/10.",Hannibal
83,Sandcooler,Doesn't hurt anybody,7,1 March 2009,"This is just something that always bothers me when it comes up: why do all the Italians in this movie speak in broken English with one another? Either way, I suppose it's not that important. This thing is quite entertaining, but pretty much loses me in its grand finale. I know Clarice Starling(a not-so-bad Julianne Moore) is supposed to be obsessed by Lecter but her actions are just downright annoying and naive. I know Lecter always has to win like he's freakin' McGyver or something, but they could have handled it a bit better. This sequel has a lot less of that tensed atmosphere, but tries to cover it up by picking up the pace a little, and there are quite a lot of bodies piling up. It makes things look like a pretty standard thriller, which I think the makers would probably settle for. Okay crowdpleaser, not a very good movie.",Hannibal
84,JuguAbraham,"Ridley Scott's best work after ""The Duellists""",8,28 November 2002,"Ridley Scott's most impressive film was his first regular movie ""The Duellists"". ""Hannibal"" is a close second in his body of work. (For those who thought ""Gladiator"" was great cinema, I would encourage them to see ""Barabbas"" made many decades ago without all the high tech special effects of ""Gladiator"".)The DVD tells us that Scott was asked to direct the film by producer Dino di Laurentiis after Jonathan Demme ""passed"" the offer to make the sequel to ""Silence of the Lambs"". Scott's ""Hannibal"" and Demme's ""Silence of the Lambs"" are as different as chalk and cheese.Though Demme won a clutch of Academy Awards, Scott's movie lifts up the content beyond a psychological cat and mouse caper with crazy murderous villains thrown in to one that adds philosophy, literature (Dante), and good music by Hans Zimmer.From the choice of music of Strauss and Bach to the special effects of the brain-eating scene, this is a work of maturity that is totally missing in Demme's film. Demme's film had concentrated on the thriller formula that limits the entertainment to the acting and story. Scott's film delves into the deeper elements of behaviour than the bizarre. Scott presents an unusual love story, where one would chop off one's hand for someone you like enough not to hurt. Scott's film present a fascinating subplot on Dante's vision of Judas' avarice. ""Hannibal"" offers pyschology (Starling looking back while running), philosophy (the Judas syndrome in human relationships, ""you are not afraid of my face but you were afraid when I spoke of God""), and black comedy (hanging of Inspector Pazzi is initially met with laughter of tourists).While Demme presented a Hannibal that is warped, devious and cunning, Scott's Hannibal is more human than the ""normal"" good guys out to put him behind bars. It is unfortunate that Julianne Moore's Starling has to be compared with Jodie Foster's interpretation of the character. If their roles were switched, the outcome of both films would have been disastrous. Moore is presented as an attractive woman at several points of the movie, while Foster was seen as a cold professional with no interest in sex. Moore is more conscious of her womanhood (she puts ""post-it"" sticker to cover her breasts in the drawing sent by Hannibal"").I do not know how much David Mamet contributed to the script of Hannibal--but the end-product has a script that is far superior to the Demme's film. I love films with scripts written by Mamet and this was no exception.The final scene on the plane was as interesting verbally as the end of ""Silence of the lambs"" was physically (Hannibal's walk in Africa).I recommend Hans Zimmer's interview on the DVD version. Zimmer is emerging as the best composer for cinema after Ennio Morricone. This film is probably Zimmer's best work after ""The Thin Red Line"".All in all, I consider ""Hannibal"" a more sophisticated work than ""Silence of the lambs"" with richer entertainment value.",Hannibal

86,philip_vanderveken,"If it wasn't for Hopkins' performance, this movie would have been one of the worst I've ever seen.",5,26 January 2005,"If there is one thing about this movie that I can be absolutely sure of, than it must be that this is one of the most controversial movies I've ever seen. I don't think any other movie has filled so many viewers with such disgust and horror as ""Hannibal"" did. Personally I could cope with all the extreme and explicit violence and gore, but I'm convinced that many others had to make a quick run to the toilet when seeing it all.What shocked me more than all the gore was the overall quality of this sequel. I really wonder why Anthony Hopkins ever said yes to it. OK, his performance as Dr. Hannibal Lecter is still stunning. I really love him as the graceful, distinguished gentleman who now lives in Florence, Italy, working as a curator for a museum. The average villain in other horror movies is a brainless idiot (sometimes literally), but not in this case. Hannibal Lecter loves fine art and culture, good food and wine,... and I can really appreciate that. But it's the rest of the cast. Which idiot decided that the best replacement for Jodie Foster would be Julianne Moore? I know Foster didn't want to participate in the sequel (smart girl), but I'm sure there must be another way to replace her. Why didn't they say Julianne Moore was her sister who wants to continue Clarice's work after she died in a tragic car accident? I know, that's not great either, but at least I wouldn't compare her to Foster then. But what bothers me even more is that Julianne Moore and Anthony Hopkins may well be the only two actors worth mentioning. All the others were, to put it nicely, rather unconvincing and superfluous.I can understand why the studio chose Ridley Scott as the director. OK, the man hasn't always made great movies (for instance G.I. Janes was pretty awful), but he sure has proved to be able to make really good movies as well (Let's think of Gladiator and Blackhawk Down). I've always given the man some credit, but with this movie he only proves that sometimes his bad taste takes it over from his talent. The same for the guy who wrote the script: David Mamet. He has talent, no doubt about that. He wrote the scenarios for movies like ""The Untouchables"", ""Glengarry Glen Ross"", ""Wag the Dog"", ""Ronin""... all very good movies, but I really wonder why he had to add so much gore and such an awful first 45 minutes to the movie.All in all this movie really shouldn't have been made. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a modern classic, the kind of movie we don't get to see enough, but also the kind of movie that should be left alone. It's the kind of movie that needs no sequel or prequel (in my opinion no movie does, but TSOTL even less than others). If it wasn't for Hopkins' performance, I would have hated this movie like I haven't hated many other movies before. Now I give it a 5/10.",Hannibal
87,screenman,Enough's As Good As A Feast.,5,15 June 2008,"When cinema produces an absolute classic like 'Silence Of The Lambs', it's asking a lot to take the material and do something as good, never mind better. Sometimes a sequel actually is superior, as in 'Terminator', 'Star Wars' and 'Aliens'. Something that was missing from the first outing because of budgetary constraints, availability of effects or whatever, can be put into a follow-up and just give it that very special edge. Other times it is a big, big mistake, or just a blatant attempt to cash-in on the overwhelming success of its original.This item appears to fall into both of those latter categories.In 'The Silence' we were spared most of the brutality of Hannibal Lecter. It was either glimpsed, shot at a distance, or implied. But here we get the full monty. There were times when I felt impelled to look away from the screen. It was needless, tasteless and crude.Secondly, the shock value of what wily Dr L could do was fresh and new in the original. We saw this intelligent beastly man doing his stuff for the first time. Here; it was just business as usual, with the graphic excess thrown in to make up the original shock quota.In short, a truly spellbinding classic was reduced to a cheap slasher. Hanny Lecter was seen as no more than Freddy Kruger with arty pretensions. Oh-yes, we got the sweeping, luxurious camera-work, the indulgent, incidental mood-music of orchestral and Gregorian choral tracts. It was suitably dark in that Hammer-like Gothic style. And it was long and slow and tedious in a way that was intended to create atmosphere, but instead demonstrated that Ridley Scott knew there'd be plenty of bums on seats merely because of the movie's title, so he could squander a bit of celluloid to play us along for a little while. It would give us the feeling that we'd actually seen a clever, thoughtful movie instead of a shabby generic cash-in.I missed a few minutes of the ending, in pursuit of a nice cup of tea, but returned to see Lecter's face gradually vignetting on the screen like a malevolent Cheshire Cat, until only his eye was visible before the credits rolled. It was surely warning that we might expect a three-quel should this crap turn over enough wonga.Anthony Hopkins so completely made Dr Lecter's persona his own that a movie about 'Hannibal' could hardly have been made without him. Clearly, he was given an offer her couldn't refuse to do the business again, which hardly does his own discernment credit. Jodie Foster, on the other hand, had the self-respect and good sense not to reprise her role as Clarice Starling. Much more credit to her judgement. Instead, Julianne Moore vainly attempted to fill her 'cheap shoes' and gave as unmemorable and lacklustre a performance as this effort deserved. Ray Liotta was wheeled-in as a spare 'big name' but seemed a little lost in the absence of an entourage of wise-guys. Beyond them the most prominent others were largely misshapen, ugly unknowns, who merely served as side-dishes for Hannibal's grisly menu. If you enjoy good quality movies irrespective of their subject material, then you probably thrilled to 'The Silence' just as I did. And in that case I would counsel you not to watch this follow-up as it rather sullies the memory and uniqueness of the original. But if you ain't so picky, if you're disinclined to care when someone draws a moustache on the Mona Lisa, or if you rate Freddy Kruger as the stuff of Oscars, then you'll probably think this is good, with blood.I didn't.",Hannibal
88,brando647,Further Exploits of a Hannibal Lecter,8,1 October 2008,"Ten years after Clarice Starling first encountered the evil Hannibal Lecter, we finally receive a sequel to one of my favorite movies. I'd read the novel right after its release and I become pumped to see the movie when it was finally released in theaters. As I stated, I was a major fan of the first film and the idea of a second movie, centering completely on one of my favorite movie characters, was appealing. Long after his escape in Memphis, Hannibal Lecter finds himself living in Florence, Italy, where he is the running to become the curator for a major library. In America, Clarice Starling has just endured a major blow to her career in the FBI as a drug bust goes terribly wrong. As a result, she is returned to the Hannibal Lecter case at the prompting of millionaire (and one of Lecter's only surviving victims) Mason Verger, who has his own plans for the doctor.The novel was somewhere around 600-pages and had a strong, in-depth storyline...much more than they could ever hope to fit into the average feature film. So a good portion of the book was trimmed for the film, though they left most of the major aspects in place (though some parts were modified from the original story). Even still, by fitting so much into the film, I definitely felt the running time during some scenes. I felt that when the focus shifted to Florence and Italian detective Rinaldo Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini), the film slowed to a crawl for the following 45 minutes. The film's overall pacing seems to speed up and slow down randomly throughout the course of the film. Visually, though, the film is beautiful and done well.This film is missing two major aspects of the first: director Jonathan Demme and Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling. In my opinion, yeah Demme's great, but Ridley Scott is better and it was awesome having him direct this film. As for Foster, I would have preferred to have her reprise her role but Julianne Moore did a good job of filling in the role. Anthony Hopkins returns as the titular character and continues to show why Lecter is one of my favorite film characters. The man is evil, charismatic, and (despite his history of eating people) so damned likable. Aside from Hopkins, the real highlight of this movie for me was Gary Oldman as the disfigured Mason Verger. I don't know what it is about that guy but I love his performances in eccentric roles.I loved the blend of grisly violence and elegant sophistication in this film. In one scene, you're seeing Lecter's charming side as he wins the position of library curator; later, you're watching as one of Lecter's enemies is hung/disemboweled. You've got to love it. All of these aspects come together to form a movie that's good but not great. It's an entertaining way to spend a little more than 2 hours and it gives you a good feel for the twisted killer, but the film has it's flaws that make it a film I can only watch once in a while because of it's pacing.",Hannibal
89,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Hannibal""- A frankly dumbfounding follow-up. Both stunning and schlocky, it entertains despite its faults.",7,2 January 2017,"Director Ridley Scott's frequently stunning but oftentimes misjudged 2001 release ""Hannibal"" is perhaps the biggest head-scratcher of modern cinema. It rides and often oversteps a fine line between art and schlock, yet always remains consistently entertaining and enthralling despite its tonal confusion and plethora of problems. As a sequel to the classic ""Silence of the Lambs"", it falls short and lacks sophistication and psychological depth. But as a sort-of stand- alone release that places more emphasis on style and brutality over story, it's a compelling enough watch to make it worth a sit. Just be sure to bring your barf bag.Some years after the escape of Hannibal Lecter, Clarice Starling is made into a scapegoat after a drug-bust goes terribly wrong. Disgraced, Starling is soon brought on by the wealthy but horribly disfigured madman Mason Verger, who wishes to use her as a pawn to draw Lecter out of hiding so he can seek revenge for his scarring. At the same time, Italian Chief Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi is also seeking out Lecter in order to get his hands on a massive bounty set out by Verger. Eventually, the stories converge in a mad climax of blood and brutality from which not everyone might escape.The stars here are obviously our incredible cast and director Scott's operatic eye for engaging and stylish visuals. Anthony Hopkins continues to define the role of Lecter, and plays the part with a childish glee. It's really sort-of fun in a perverse way to see ""Hannibal the Cannibal"" able to operate in the real world. While Jodie Foster refused to return to the role, Julianne Moore makes for an excellent replacement as Starling and gives the role all the ""oomph"" it needs. Gary Oldman is quite good as the sometimes cartoonish but genuinely disturbing villain that is Mason Verger. And supporting roles by the likes of Ray Liotta and Giancarlo Giannini are exceptionally well cast and genuinely well- played.Ridley Scott is a man known for the visuals and aesthetics that he meticulously paints on-screen, and this film is no exception. From the opening scene through the disturbing and disgusting climax, Scott excels with a wonderful sense of composition and movement, gliding through scenes with a slick manner and good pace. The film is simply gorgeous by any stretch of the imagination, and Scott works in conjunction with gifted cinematographer John Mathieson and editor Pietro Scalia to craft an visually arresting tale.Unfortunately, it's the story at large and indeed the script by David Mamet and Steven Zaillian that's the big problem here. While I want to view the film as a stand alone, it must be said that the novel that served as inspiration was a peculiar one. And it just didn't translate quite that well to screen, even when they tried to fix some of the big issues that fans had trouble swallowing. This film is a bit of a mess when it comes to the general plotting and the development of character. It's patchy. Confused. And all too often, the duo seem more intent to deliver the most twisted of bodily horror and grotesque of gore instead of focusing on the more important things like subtlety and nuance. Yes, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" was a dark and disturbing work. But with ""Hannibal""... too much focus is placed on splattering organs, gushes of blood, faces ripped from bodies and absolutely demented forms of punishment and torture. This isn't really a proper follow-up to that classic original... this is big-budget torture porn. It even comes at the expense of the psychological analysis of the characters- something that was a key ingredient to the success of ""Silence."" Jame Gumb was a compelling and twisted creature, yet we understood him to at least some extent and could feel a depth to his character. Verger is just a psychopath seeking revenge because his face got messed up, even if they try to shoehorn in a backstory about his history as a child molester that is never brought up again. Jack Crawford was a compelling male supporting character, and his relationship with Starling was subtle and quite sweet. Ray Liotta's Paul Krendler is just a creep with a thing for Starling. Even Lecter feels a bit watered down, despite the excellent performance and some swanky dialog that Hopkins hisses with splendor.Really, the film is just very pretty schlock with great performances......and that's kinda why I enjoy it, honestly!Is it the sequel we wanted? Absolutely not! But is it kinda fun to watch and really trippy to behold? Yes, yes yes! It's basically a big-budget freak-show starring some of our favorite characters, and what it lacks in depth, it makes up for in spectacle and revulsion. There's a reason it didn't win any big awards. But there's also a reason it's still talked about and doesn't have all that bad a score here. It's just really depraved entertainment, and if you can get over your gag reflex and the fact it's never gonna live up to the promise of that iconic original... you could definitely do a lot worse.Strictly for entertainment value and for it's beautiful imagery, I give ""Hannibal"" a pretty good 7 out of 10.",Hannibal
90,Luigi Di Pilla,Hannibal Lecter may be clever but this movie wasn't,6,19 December 2005,"This was not an intelligent thriller and it is no doubt the worst of the Hannibal trilogy called ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Red Dragon"". I mean the audience has not much puzzles to solve but there are instead bloody scenes that kept at least my attention till the unappetizing end. There were some slow paced scenes which were compensated by brutal acts. The last Hannibal in RED DRAGON was better than this one because the plots and twists were not so ridiculous. The story tries to explain the psychological profile from Lecter and his preferred meals. It's definitely not my level and that's why I rate it with only 6/10.",Hannibal
91,valadas,Not bad at all,6,20 March 2001,"If you have seen ""The Silence of the Lambs"" just forget about it since this movie has nothing to do with the other one except for the fact that the main character is the same and goes on eating people. The philosophical or metaphysical feature that was present in ""The Silence..."" is not here anymore. This is just a  technically well done horror suspense movie with an excellent performance of the two main actors (the cannibal and the policewoman)and with a good well told story solidly built up. Some images are very good and almost poetic like those which take place in Florence. The dubious relationship that establishes itself between the two main characters is very interesting though just suggested. Well you won't lose much if you don't see this movie but if you do you won't find the ticket money wasted after all.",Hannibal

93,mjw2305,A Decent Closing Chapter,7,30 January 2005,"Hannibal, now living in Italy posing as a an art scholar, and already hiding from the FBI and the families of his victims, is now being setup by a former patient of his. A patient who he convinced to cut off he own face and feed it to the dogs, using Clarice Starling as bait, he intends to lure Lecter out of hiding and play out his revenge.With Ridley Scott at the Helm of this thriller, Hannibal is, despite its slow pace is an effective movie, that at times succeeds in shocking and disgusting its viewing public, with some horrific imagery that with the help of your imagination makes you feel sick to the stomach.Critised by many people, i ask you to remember this, Silence of the lambs is a tough act to follow and Hannibal manages to it follow it, without losing too much of the atmosphere and tension in the original. Yes, Lambs is better, but that doesn't make this a bad movie.7/10",Hannibal
94,dunmore_ego,The Violence Of The Hams.,5,26 December 2003,"WARNING: Spoilers flow like Chianti.I have seen The Exorcist, I have seen The Omen, I have seen The Sixth Sense, I have seen the face of Death in Bergman's Seventh Seal - yet I was still unprepared for the bone-chilling horror I experienced in Hannibal, watching Julianne Moore's acting. Julianne Moore played Jodie Foster, while Anthony Hopkins played a psycho butler. (No really, my brain hurts...)Ridley Scott, the creative director who helmed Alien, Blade Runner and Gladiator, fell asleep during production and let a monkey take over.Julianne Moore should publicly apologize to everyone who saw Hannibal and wash Jodie Foster's car for a year.Jodie - I don't blame you for turning this role down, honey! Seeing this revamped version of her character, we realize that gone is the complex fledgling FBI agent we empathized with in Silence, to be replaced by a domineering, emasculating cyborg - Clarice Starling has morphed into RIPLEY! (No small blame aimed at this particular director!) - which accounts for Moore's pants, at least. (And lest we forget, it was Ridley Scott who also embarrassed us with G.I. Jane in 1997.) Granted, the passage of a decade would see changes wrought in any character, but Starling's 'character' is missing in action in this movie, replaced by a stock sheaf of clichés and woman-empowering rhetoric. The film-makers have gone and done what the Highlander poofs did: compromised everything that came before, by everything that comes after. They even re-wrote the film ending in a vain attempt to draw Jodie out, but she made a correct decision in staying away, as the re-worked film ending is even stupider than the book's ending.Ray Liotta phoned it in. Maybe it was the fact that Lecter was ultimately going to slice open the top of his skull to eat his brain, which prompted Hair & Makeup to neglect giving him a decent HAIRSTYLE for this movie.Scott Glenn - where are you?Thomas Harris, author of Hannibal, the followup book to Silence Of The Lambs, perpetrated the same sin that Michael Crichton committed in his Jurassic epoch - wrote the same book with a bigger bank account. Oh, he also put in some crazy unbalanced rubbish because.. well, because people were expecting him to put in some crazy unbalanced rubbish. Like the book, from which the movie-makers drew about 50% of their storyline, the film is. *predictably* gruesome. Evisceration? Coming right up. Biting people's faces off? - you betcha! Blood spurting from severed arteries as if from a fire hose? Oooo!, sign me up for that! Whereas Jonathan Demme's taut psycho-thriller, The Silence Of The Lambs, took us on a seat-gripping psychological foray into the masterfully manipulative mind of Hannibal Lecter, suddenly we end up in Friday The 13th: The Hannibal Years - a slasher film for the faux-cerebral.The Saviors of Hannibal: the eponymous anti-hero himself, the droll, dread Anthony Hopkins (Violent Ham No.1) and that delectable chameleon of cinematic cheesedom, Gary Oldman (Violent Ham No.2), playing Mason Verger, a disfigured previous victim of Hannibal's. Even with substandard directorial cohesion, weak dialog and Julianne Moore, some actors just can't be stultified: any words in the mouth of the artisan Oldman turn to sweet, sweet, insane love-juice, whilst Hopkins savors each syllable like his now-infamous Chianti, deploying weight and depth by merely inflecting his voice, as other actors need to achieve these same standards of craft by screaming, shooting or taking off their clothes; as some insecure directors need to achieve this same level of impact by spending $40 million on computer-generated effects which waste everyone's time and are irrelevant to the storyline, George.As in any Hollywood sequel trying to secure the widest, dumbest demographic, punches were pulled all over the place: The film completely ignored Mason Verger's penchant for drinking the tears of children that he taunted into weeping. Even Eric Cartman went further than Ridley Scott, licking the tears of misery from Scott Tenorman's face after he tricked him into eating his parents in a chili con-carnival.In the book, Lecter and Starling sit down to a luxurious supping on detective Krendler's brain, not simply one piece fed to Krendler. Though that was the best scene in the movie by far, it wasn't nearly enough to make me vomit more than once.Rather than regarding Hannibal Lecter as the psychopathic murdering swine that society would be apt to regard him as, the movie LEANS on the viewing audience to regard him as the 'hero' ('anti-hero' is merely a euphemism to assuage your consciences).At film's end (again, in a wayward departure from the book), Lecter cuts off his OWN hand rather than Starling's, to escape the 'arm' of the law (- couldn't... resist). So we are shown that, though Lecter is a calculating, psychopathic, pan-sexual, cannibalistic butcher, he still has a heart of gold when it comes to his unrequited lady love - well, ain't that precious?After all the hype surrounding the 'long-awaited' sequel - snicker - the throaty-voiced hype, as always, far outweighed the quality of the belated, bloated product.In a more concise interpretation of the above discourse: Eat me!(Movie Maniacs, read this unabridged review at: www.poffysmoviemania.com/Hannibal.html)",Hannibal
95,pyrocitor,The Return of the Cannibal,9,5 September 2006,"Good sequels are truly hard to find in cinemas these days, when one considers the loads of commercial garbage we are bombarded with in an attempt to destroy our sense of taste or intelligence. One might have had such a fear to the follow-up to the immensely successful ""The Silence of the Lambs"", the third film in motion picture history to pick up ""the big five"" at the Academy Awards. The primary fear for continuing the morbid misadventures of Anthony Hopkins' twisted genius would be that the memory of the original would be horribly tainted by a turgid sequel. Fortunately enough, producers were wise enough to avoid such a fate by rounding up an incredibly talented supporting cast and crew to make Hopkins' reprisal of his signature role a true success. The involvement of a director of such high caliber as Ridley Scott likely helped the success of the project immeasurably. A sequel after having not directed the first might seem an odd career choice for the man just academy award nominated for directing ""Gladiator"", but Scott's entire career is full of such eclectic choices, and one must be very thankful he did, for he adds a truly unique touch filled with endless class to Hannibal. Scott's impeccable eye for impressive architecture continues on from ""Gladiator"", as the scenes filled in Italy are incredibly beautiful, almost magical in a way, shot in slow motion with a hazy camera lens, as if in a dream. The entire film has a very detached, almost clinical touch, making it much more realistic as a crime drama rather than the typical adrenaline coursing Hollywood thriller, which makes it all the more unsettling. Yet through the suspense, tension and moments of genuine horror and disgust, there's an ever continuing sense of perverse beauty, as if Hannibal's sordid lifestyle is almost a work of gruesome art in a way. Scott deserves multitudes of praise for tying together such an impeccably crafted and truly beautiful, however morbid, film. It goes without saying that Hopkins is nothing less than astounding reprising his signature role as the cannibalistic Lector, both immeasurably creepy and captivating in turn. But despite the title, the film is not centered entirely around him -Hopkins' back up players, when given their moments to shine, also show their immense talent. Julianne Moore is wonderful, almost luminous as Clarice Starling, the FBI agent who captured Hannibal's perverse interest so entirely. Whether she is a better or worse Starling than Jodie Foster is a matter of opinion, but Moore certainly cements her status as an immensely talented and incredibly beautiful actress regardless. There's also a rather poignant surprise by the presence of a completely unrecognizable Gary Oldman, uncredited as a horribly disfigured past victim of Lector's who survived his attack. It is a testament to Oldman's incredible ability to disappear seamlessly into his characters when I, being a tremendous fan of Oldman's work had no idea he was in the movie until the end credits. In fact, Oldman would have walked away with the show were it not for Hopkins, but both appalls and impresses in order, managing to make a truly frightening yet fascinating performance shine through the disgusting prosthetics, making a truly horrifying portrait of a twisted old man. Ray Liotta is also a strong presence as a sarcastic co-worker of Starling's, and especially shines in his final scene, without giving anything away, those who have seen will understand. Hannibal is one of those rare sequels which measures up in quality to its predecessor. Scott has crafted a truly horrifying, yet perversely beautiful and endlessly fascinating film, with Hopkins reprising his immortal role backed by a truly talented troupe of actors to tremendous effect. Fans of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" or just a good criminal drama should certainly seek out Hannibal - he may be horrifying, yet one can't look away.-9/10",Hannibal
96,blumdeluxe,A new chapter that isn't really necessary,7,23 September 2017,"""Hannibal"" continues the saga of Dr. Hannibal Lecter from ""Silence of the lambs"". Hannibal meanwhile escaped to Italy where he lives as curator of a prestigious library. Being chased by both a former victim and the police, he contacts Clarice Sterling to continue their morbid chase.If you take away the prominent franchise, what you get is pretty much a very explicit but also quite basic thriller. There is an agent thrown out of service, a corrupt colleague, a very intelligent but arrogant villain and a personal connection between killer and investigator. There are also some big logical gaps that are somehow explained but not really to a point where no questions remain. Lecter moves around so obvious, killing people on open street without the slightest attempt to mask himself that it is truly painful. Also with all due respect to the special role Sterling plays in Lecter's mindset, I don't believe him losing his hand for her is something very likely to happen. However there will be many people with many intelligent explanations for that and so this is surely debatable.All in all I just don't think this film adds much to the franchise or would have been necessary. It is, more or less, just a basic thriller that takes profit from the prominent set of characters it is able to re-establish.",Hannibal
97,Sirus_the_Virus,"Not as good as the original, but still one of the best films of 2001.",9,23 January 2010,"When The Silence of the lambs was released in 1991, everyone loved it. It even won best picture. Anthony Hopkins won best actor. Lord knows he deserved it cause even when I see him in a film now days I get worried. He was that good. Jodie Foster also won for best actress. She was brilliant too. and it won other awards that the film truly deserved. Then eight years later, Thomas Harris wrote Hannibal, and the film was released two years later.Everyone was expecting this movie to be like The Silence of the lambs. And unfortunately nobody was feeling it the second time around. I don't see why. There is only a couple of flaws. some critics hated it and some said it was alright.Being the harsh critic I am, I didn't see many flaws. Well, for starters, Jodie Foster isn't in it. Julianne Moore didn't do a bad job at all. She just wasn't Jodie Foster. Another thing is that the film doesn't have the smart conversations between Clarice and Lecter. Those are pretty much the only flaws in the film. Anthony Hopkins is of course spectacular. Hannibal is a little more gruesome than the original. And that was one gruesome film. The end to Hannibal is absolutely disgusting. So the movie isn't as good as the original. I had a very good time with it though. If only Thomas Harris was still alive. I would love to see more of Dr. Lecter.The sequel takes place ten years after Silence of the lambs. Clarice(played by Julianne Moore) hasn't spoken to Dr. Lecter(played by the always brilliant Anthony Hopkins) since the day she was promoted. But since then Clarice has gotten fired do to a shooting. Now Hannibal is living in Florence. And there are three different people trying to hunt him down. Clarice herself, an Italian cop(played by Ginnacarlo Gianni), and a survivor of Dr. Lecter(played by Gary Oldman). They all have there reasons for looking for him. The Italian cops is for the $3,000,000 reward. The survivor wants him for revenge. Eventually, Hannibal travels back to America. In which he sort of teams up with Agent Starling and has to save himself.So as I mentioned earlier, this isn't as good as the original. But it is very entertaining, and a bloody good time. This movie will make you cringe, gasp and other things. These are good films. Hannibal is underrated. And it comes in second place for me. That's what I think.Hannibal: A-",Hannibal
98,PatrynXX,"Disappointing, not as violent sequel",7,21 February 2001,"Contrary to reports of critics running out of the theater, I was prepared for this ultimate violent movie.  Not so.(SPOILERS!!!!!)Okay.  So Ray Liotta eats his own brain.  So Hannibal cuts off his own hand because he is infatuated with Clarice.  So he disembowels someone at the same time hanging the man.  All this could have been done with a little more show.  Compared to the second movie (Silence of the Lambs. Manhunter being the first) this is like Silence of the Lambs light.  Hilarious at times, hannibal being the hero of course.  A love sick puppy.  However in this movie you come off feeling Hannibal isn't all that bad compared to that freak in SOTL.  There's so much more suspense in SOTL that this is the reason I left disappointed.  SOTL took several weeks to finish because at the time it was probably the most scariest movie I'd seen.  (Evil Dead is the most scariest I've seen nowadays.  I've tried twice now to watch it again but just can't)  SOTL still gives me the creepies.  Hannibal is just plain fun to watch.  Gary Oldman however is rather tough to look at.  Great in the makeup dept.  These guys should get an Oscar for this one.  Moore plays Clarice simply perfect and it's Jodie's loss that she wasn't in this movie.  But Jodie did a better job in spots in SOTL.  Overall, if your looking for a violent gory movie.  This movie isn't it.  If your looking for a love story (minus the brain scene) perhaps you might like it. ;)  Having never seen Manhunter I can't proclaim this movie the best to watch.  But it's easier to watch Hannibal than SOTL.  SOTL is just gross.  Hannibal we get to say go Hannibal go!!!! Kill those Sons a b_____'s!!!  They are so RUDE!! 7/10",Hannibal
99,baumer,Did Rick Baker work on this film?,7,13 February 2001,"Silence of the Lambs was an over rated film that unjustly went down in film annals as one of the best ever made.  Hannibal, on the other hand is being criticized by the so called ""experts"" as being an inferior film.  And while I don't think it is an amazing film, it sure is better than Silence ever was or could ever hope to be.  Manhunter introduced us to Lecter, Silence furthered his character and Hannibal gets us inside his head, and I like what's in there.  Kind of funny to say about a cannibalistic, psychotic, serial killer, isn't it?There are probably going to be about 1500 reviews in this forum about Hannibal so I will skip the usual boundaries of film review and leave that to better reviewers in here such as M.A.Rogers, who I'm sure will have a review in here somewhere about the film.  If you really want to know if this is a good film or not, read his review.  All I really want to say is a few things.  First, this is head and shoulders above Silence of the Lambs and two, this is some of the best gore I have ever seen in any film, horror or otherwise.  And I began to ask myself if Rick Baker was ever summoned to work on this film for the makeup and special effects.  I scrolled down the credits and saw that he was not a part of it.  Then I came across Greg Cannom's name and although he is not as familiar to me, his name did strike a chord.  I thought I remembered seeing his name on Big Momma's House as a makeup guy.  So I clicked onto his name and what a surprise I was in for. This guy has done some outstanding work on over 70 productions, including Little Nicky, Back to the Future II, Lost Boys and The Howling.  And who did the Howling's makeup?  Rick Baker.  Greg Cannom must be a Rick Baker protegee.  Well what a master this guy turned out to be.  Baker will always be the king of makeup with films like Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Friday the 13th and such, but Cannom has to be the modern day master.  I have never seen gore so realistically done in any movie, and that includes some of Baker's greats.  There are two scenes in this film that just blew me away. One of course was the now infamous final scene where one character has to eat his own brain.  This is so incredible, so gory and so so cool.  Where most people were turning away in disgust and surprise, I was glued to my seat and asked myself over and over again: ""How did they do that?""  The realism in this film is unlike any I have ever been privy to in all the movies I have seen.  I applaud Greg Cannom and his crew for making all the disgusting blood and guts that we see in this film.  What a trip.As for the rest of the film, it is quite good.  I enjoyed Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling and Gary Oldman is priceless as Mason Verger.  I wonder if he will be mentioned next year at Oscar time.  I doubt it but he is quite delicious as the man without a face.  It's strange; Hannibal is a cold blooded killer that has murdered many people.  He is fiendish and responsible for ruining many people's lives, yet we route for him.  When he is in danger, we want people to help him.  And that is what is quite amazing about the character and the film.  Clarice has been drawn to him perhaps the same way that we have.  We all know he is bad but we want to see him free.  Even his final victim is a welcome death ( despite the cruelty of it ) because of how he is to Clarice.  We want to see him die.  And if that is the case, then there will be plenty more Hannibals to come.  I look forward to the remake of Manhunter and to all the sequels that Hannibal will spawn.  Silence of the Lambs was an okay film, Hannibal is better but not amazing and Manhunter was quite good.  Now I want to see the next film in the series wow me in every way.  Not just by feeding someone's brains to them, but with the whole film.  If it can't find a way to do that, then a good disembowlment will have to saffice.8 out of 10-  Props to Greg Cannom.  Excellent work!",Hannibal
100,DunnDeeDaGreat,A great film in the Lector triolgy,8,21 August 2001,"Seeing Hannibal makes me think back to the greatness of Manhunter and Silence Of The Lambs. When one just looks into the eyes of Hannibal you see get a sense of true fear. The direction in this film is great and the acting is once again superb. The jump scenes are right on target and the effectiveness is once again good. Anthony Hopkins is great as always as is Juilanne Moore.

101,kevin c,POOR FOOD,3,17 February 2001,"This film proved to be an unsurprisingly dull film. It provided none of the tension generated by ""Silence of the Lambs"". The story seemed overlong and totally unsure of itself.  The excellent Moore was terribly miscast as Starling. Lecter just turned into a joke. Second-rate James Bond gags, and a man so evil that he even strikes fear into Alsatians and wild boars. Please. Like so many hyped films these days, it's very poor.",Hannibal
102,mentalcritic,"A typical example of what happens when you try to ""improve"" a novel...",4,11 November 2002,"Hannibal was doomed right from the start. While the novel was a long time coming, it just didn't have the oomph that The Silence Of The Lambs or Red Dragon contained. Clarice Starling is not the best character to base anything around, in fact. Compared to her predecessor, she's about as interesting as a thumb tack, even if Lecter thought otherwise. But Thomas Harris must have thought ""hey, let's put Lecter in Italy, turn Clarice's life upside down, and have the entire world go after them by degree"".Thus begins the first and most difficult problem in Hannibal - by the time it is over, there is not a single character other than the titular one whom you won't hate. The film does absolutely nothing to fix this, either, and bringing Paul Krendler into the sequel without his quick introduction in The Silence Of The Lambs doesn't help matters, either. In the end, one assumes Krendler hates Starling for the hell of it. It would have been far more interesting to have Will Graham trying to hunt Lecter down, considering what went on at the end of Red Dragon (a point glossed over by both film versions).Reading past this paragraph might ruin the film for you even more than Jodie Foster's bitching over the script already has.The biggest problem with the film version of Hannibal is the same one with Manhunter. In essence, the film has no respect for the source material. The essence of Hannibal was Clarice having to choose between her loyalty to law enforcement as a concept, herself, or what her father represented to her. The choice she eventually makes, with the help of Lecter, in fact, is one of the most jarring and bizarre twists you'll ever experience in print. In the film, Lecter simply cuts off his own hand and makes a dash for it. Join me in a chorus of ""ho hum"" if you will. I'm eternally grateful that I read the novel before I watched the film.The Verger clan was also poorly represented in the film. What the hell happened to Mason's lesbian, steroid-munching sister who wanted Mason to be a sperm donor for her love child? And don't get me started on the poor dialogue coaching. My girlfriend, who was born and raised in Italy, found the Florence scenes more laughable than horrifying. Lecter's pronunciation is so poor that it's a wonder he didn't get arrested within an hour of disembarking from the plane, and this can be fairly and squarely blamed upon the producers for not having the good sense to hire an Italian dialect coach. It cannot be blamed upon Sir Anthony Hopkins - he makes a decent piecemeal out of a badly scripted part. Which brings me to another point - Lecter is nowhere near as frightening out of captivity as he is in. When he was behind bars, he was able to make trained psychiatrists burst into tears, but out in the world, his methodology is about as subtle as a nuclear strike on an outhouse. There is no sense that he can crawl under your skin and infect your mind. Hell, if you're quick and strong enough, it seems there is little he can really do to you.Another interesting plot thread that was dumped from the film was Mischa, Lecter's baby sister. One wonders when reading Hannibal if the disappearance and apparent gassing of Mischa is what made Lecter the elegant psychopath that he is. Granted, it is mostly in the brain's chemistry, but hey, having your little sister taken from you and finding her as little more than a pile of bones is enough to influence anyone into murdering numerous people. It also makes Lecter seem like a deeper, more complete character than the facade offered here.Julianne Moore makes a decent Clarice Starling, but she underplays the character as opposed to Jodie Foster's overacting, which creates two highly conflicting impressions of the character. After reading the novels, I've never had much sympathy for the character, but this helps a theory of mine, in that Lecter is Harris' answer to Tolkien's One Ring. Essentially, Lecter is a vortex that uses other characters' weaknesses to suck them in, chew them up, and spit them out. In Harris' novels, Graham, Starling, and Verger are like the Ringwraiths, in that they are rare examples of people who've been swallowed by the vortex and lived to tell about it, although neither of them are particularly happy about it.The essential problem with the film then, and to a lesser degree with all three of the other films (or rather especially so in the case of the frankly appalling Manhunter) is that they take a novel with great depth, only to make something very devoid of substance with it. The De Laurentiises tried to add a ""happy"" ending to Hannibal. What they created instead was an abomination the likes of which hasn't been since since The Matrix's wholesale piracy of Doctor Who and Hong Kong cinema.",Hannibal

104,Karl Self,Boooooooring!,1,12 March 2001,"Synopsis:  the sequel to the acclaimed Silence Of The Lambs, Hannibal is a big budget production that totally fails to deliver;  not only is it not as clever as its predecessor, it is not even a splatter or suspense or horror movie, just a totally boring time waster.  Do not be fooled by the media hype, and particularly the stories about people throwing up in cinema and being mentally scarred for the rest of their lifes because of the brain - eating scene:  in the movie it just comes across as laughably bad SFX. Why so many people in this forum are claiming that H is ""not all bad"" and ""worth watching on the big screen"", etc., is beyond me;  and it is not ""so bad it's good"" either, it is just plain boring.  I normally respect other people's opinion, but in this case I have to say that they clearly can not tell **** from Shine - Ola.  Maybe they have fallen prey to the media hype, maybe they have never seen a Ridley Scott movie before and were impressed by his excessive use of back lighting, smoke and the ubiquitous AC fans.  H is totally devoid of suspense;  instead we get endless scenes of Lecter swanning through an English - speaking Firenze, a totally unconvincing and uninvolving plot with more holes than a fishing net (after seeing H, I actually lay awake half of the night trying to find all the holes in the plot, and when I wrote them down I quickly filled 6 pages in small type before forcing myself to stop).  Rather than wasting your time and money on seeing it on the big screen, I would advise you to wait until it comes on TV in a couple of years;  and then to go to bed early.1 / 10.Below are a couple of extra bones I have to pick with Hannibal:H _is_ the sequel to SOTL, despite what some people in this forum are claiming.  And even though SOTL was a very tough act to follow, there are sequels which _are_ en par with their predecessors (SOTL itself was the sequel to Michael Mann's ""Manhunter"", based on Thomas Harris' ""Red Dragon"", and even though the first episode was a very enjoyable film, SOTL was even better;  another example would be the Alien series initiated by H's director Ridley Scott -- so much for the theory of diminishing sequels).  In any case, being a sequel is no excuse for a film being utter crap.This movie has a renowned director, it is based on a novel by the same author as SOTL, the cast is strictly A - list, great cinematography, big budget, first - rate script writers, yadda, yadda, yadda, and the end result is simply a fart in the church.  So what went wrong?  I think a lot of the blame has to go to the film's producer, Dino DeLaurentiis.  Here is my interpretation:  DDL produced ""Manhunter"", which, despite of all its qualities, was a commercial flop.  Disappointed, he gave the rights for the Hannibal Lecter character to Orion -- for free, allowing Jonathan Demme to make SOTL, and the rest is cinema history.  DDL then had to wait for ten more years (he is now 81) until Thomas Harris finally came up with the sequel novel.  I think at this point DDL had lost all interest in making a good movie and was desperate to finally get his slice of the the cake before he pops his cork.Another aspect that I find thoroughly annoying about this flick is that it is being given so much undeserved hype in the media;  I mean, it is boring, yet one of the highest - grossing productions ever, so there is no need to give it free publicity.  And while most reviewers harp on about how Dantesque the scenes in Firenze are and why Jodie Foster did not participate, the simple fact that this movie is an utter, utter, UTTER flop goes unmentioned.  But there is more:  not only is Hannibal being hyped through the roof, it is also being used as a media agenda setter for a plethora of ""documentaries"" (usually the left - overs from similar productions in the wake of SOTL) about serial killers, cannibalism and profiling.  However, not only does H not even pretend to be realistic; Lecter has also ceased to be a serial killer (he now only kills out of necessity, or to help Clarice Starling), profiling is not even mentioned (because we already know HL, so there is no need to create a profile) and there is also no cannibalism:  Lecter feeds the drugged - up Paul Krendler his own brain, so that makes it (erm) unaware vivo - auto - cannibalism. Try making a documentary out of that.Much has been said about the acting:  mainly whether Julianne Moore can replace Jodie Foster, and Anthony Hopkins (who plays the lead Hannibal Lecter) is usually given a lot of praise.  I think all of these discussions are moot.  There are several of my favourite actors in this movie (namely Liotta, Oldman and Moore) but the script simply does not give them anything to work with.  Same for Hopkins:  there is no development in his character, and he is not being challenged in any way.  And by the way, he plays nearly identical characters in all of his movies, only that in H he has to do the odd bit of murder and is getting paid the tidy sum of $ 11 Million to do it.",Hannibal
105,Fernando-Rodrigues,Just DON'T,5,11 July 2021,"Clarice was reduced to an obnoxious character with no depth. Hannibal's arch in Italy is unnecessary and contributes almost nothing to the film. They wasted the main characters in this poorly written script, say no more. It's the worst film in the franchise.",Hannibal
106,one9eighty,Diving too hard compared to its predecessor,7,1 August 2018,"Clarice Starling is once again on the trail of Dr Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter. Since his escape he's been living in Italy, while Starling has been gaining her own notoriety as a no-nonsense FBI agent. Mason Verger, a rich but disfigured survivor of Dr Lecter, with an eye for revenge, wades into events in Starling's life by offering fresh clues. In order to tempt Lecter out of hiding, Verger concocts a plan to use Starling as bait. This opens up a lot of questions - Will Verger's plan come to fruition and get his revenge? Or, will Starling finally get her man? Or, will Lecter elude the authorities and Verger and manage to stay on the run? While Hannibal is a good film it's not as dark and moody as ""Silence of the Lambs"", it feels like a different kettle of fish all together - more Hollywood glossy. Where SOTLs was directed by Jonathan Demme it's Ridley Scott who takes over here. It feels like he's tried to pack more action in while making the film more modern too. Instead of a physiological nightmare there is a lot more gore, and instead of subtleties some of the events and dialogue are more obvious and brazen. In fairness to Scott though, the source material wasn't brilliant (maybe that's why Demme and Jodie Foster aren't involved?). I know this is a film review rather than a book review - but both felt like half-arsed attempted at coming to a conclusion rather than an empowered and invigorated continuation. Casting wise Anthony Hopkin's portrayal cannot be faulted - he's excellent once again. He manages to deliver even the most contrite lines with passion and emotion and is never too far away from looking like a threat ready to pounce. Gary Oldman as Mason Verger is great, albeit the prosthetics do look a little over the top (even fakes from some angles - look at his lips!). Acting wise the only characters who didn't deliver for me were Julianna Moore as Clarice Starling, and Ray Liotta as Paul Krendler. Moore comes across too flat with very little depth and pain - credit must go to Jodie Foster for making it difficult to follow the performance in SOTLs I guess. Ray Liotta comes across like he's not really trying; he's just there for fun and a pay-check. I found him annoying and unconvincing. If you read the books you won't be surprised to learn that the films, like the books kind of nose dive in comparison to SOTLs. Still decent horror/thriller's but not as dark, dirty and moody as what's come before them. 7 out of 10.",Hannibal
107,jhclues,Hopkins IS Hannibal Lecter,8,26 February 2001,"One of the most disconcerting and unsettling criminals in the history of the cinema returns, in this long awaited sequel that finds him at large and free to pursue his own unique dining habits, in `Hannibal,' directed by Ridley Scott, and starring the inimitable Anthony Hopkins as the infamous gourmet, Dr. Hannibal Lecter.  The psychological games between Hannibal and everyone's favorite F.B. I. agent, Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore), that began in `The Silence of the Lambs,' continues here, though the tension that permeated `Lambs' has been significantly reduced, mainly due to the fact that this film lacks the immediacy of the original.  Though Hannibal's presence is still coldly threatening, he simply hasn't that same sense of urgency about him in his freedom that he did in captivity.  Seeing him in a `normal' setting is just much easier to assimilate than seeing him in that ominous isolation cell in which he resided when first introduced to an unsuspecting audience in 1991. 	Probably the most chilling aspect of the film is the fact that someone as unsound as Hannibal can with such facility mask his true identity and compulsions and function so effectively within society.  It's like living among snakes without knowing which ones are venomous.  As a viewer, watching him interact with others-- knowing what we do about him-- is unnerving in itself; and when things begin to heat up and he at last shows his hand, it accords the audience some relief, in the same sense as having an illness finally diagnosed so that you can begin the treatment which precludes healing. And any respite from the ambiguous horrors of the story is welcomed, since Scott has done a superb job of creating an atmosphere and mood that poise the audience for the worst of the definite atrocities that are obviously coming. 	As for the performance of Anthony Hopkins, it goes without saying at this point that he IS Hannibal Lecter.  In reviving the role that won him an Oscar for Best Actor, he brings that same icy countenance to the screen, that same reserved manner and eyes that reflect an emptiness of soul, all of which creates an illusion of invulnerability about him.  He presents a portrait of someone who is quite capable of perpetrating acts so dark that even shadows could not prevail upon them.  And taking into account the intelligence of Lecter, and the calculating methods he employs in carrying out his heinous deeds, it makes his presence all the more disquieting, more so even than that of Norman Bates (as played by Anthony Perkins) in Hitchcock's `Psycho.' 	If at all a case could be made that there is a weak link in the film, it would have to be the presence of Julianne Moore; but it would be a tough case to make inasmuch as Moore cannot be held directly responsible for it. She simply had a nearly impossible task in attempting to fill the shoes of Jodie Foster, who made such an indelible impression as Clarice in `Lambs,' for which she received the Oscar for Best Actress.  Moore is a gifted actress, and her performance here is quite capably realized, but she doesn't quite capture that spark of intimacy that Foster's Clarice had with Hannibal, and consequently what passes between them does not evoke that same sense of dread and apprehension that was so vividly felt before.  Moore must be given credit, however, for a noble effort-- she does give a good performance here-- but taking over a part that Foster had made so intrinsically her own was a task that was just too insurmountable. 	The supporting cast includes Giancarlo Giannini (Rinaldo Pazzi), Francesca Neri (Laura Pazzi), Gary Oldman (Mason Verger), Ray Liotta (Paul Krendler), Alex Corrado (Piero), Zeljko Ivanek (Dr. Doemling), Spike Jonze (Donnie) and Frankie Faison (Barney).  There are some fairly graphic scenes in this film, but with the exception of one near the end, they all play out very quickly; this is not, after all, merely another `slice em and dice em' slasher film.  Scott presents the story in such a way that the audience is psychologically and emotionally primed to see more than is actually shown; this is simply good filmmaking.  But be advised:  Some of it will be a bit too strong for some.  In the end, `Hannibal,' though falling short of the level of excellence of `Silence of the Lambs,' is still a film that makes the ten years or so it took to bring it to the screen worth the wait.  Not for the squeamish nor those with a fragile psyche, it is a film, however, for those who would sojourn into regions beyond the known; if it is the dark places you seek, this one should more than fit the bill.  I rate this one 8/10.",Hannibal
108,CharltonBoy,Chillingly Brilliant,9,2 October 2001,"Who ever gave this film bad reviews could not sat down and watched it. I was very , very impressed with nearly every aspect of Hannibal. Firstly, it knocks spots of Silence of the Lambs. it is more scary and more thought provoking . secondly , it is not shot as if it is pandering to the mass audience. It is beautifully filmed and the sound track is perfect to suit the films mood. Thirdly the film is better than the book and how often can you say that about a movie?The book had a strange ending which was almost impossible to put into this film and i'm pleased to say the didnt. If i Had to critisise it for anything it is that i would have prefered The original clarise (Jodie Foster) she seemed more suited to the role. Hopkins is fantastic and even more scarier than before and  what about that final meal scene with Ray Liota??!! Chilling!!! Blood curdling brilliance. 9 out of 10.",Hannibal
109,KnightsofNi11,Flawed but enjoyable,7,10 July 2011,"After the monumental success of The Silence of the Lambs in 1991 it was evident that a sequel was necessary. In 1999 Thomas Harris wrote Hannibal as a sequel to his previous book. After a lot of rocky production the film adaptation of that novel was released two years later. It was a difficult film to get off the ground because of Jonathan Demme's declining of the directors chair and Jodie Foster's iffy return as Clarice Starling. The producers scored Ridley Scott to helm the film almost by sheer luck and were also able to keep the incredible Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter. Jodie Foster eventually declined the role and Julianne Moore was recast as Starling. And so the film did end up getting its release, receiving mixed reviews from critics and audiences alike.Hannibal picks up ten years after The Silence of the Lambs. Clarice Starling's career is on the decline and Lecter has been in hibernation in Italy ever since his escape during the Buffalo Bill fiasco. Starling is determined to regain her reputation by tracking down and capturing Lecter. However, there is another deviant who wants to do the same. Mason Verger, the horribly deformed yet still living victim of Lecter's plans his gruesome revenge, getting in the way of Starling's investigation. And so begins the harrowing search for Lecter, a psychopath ready to come out of retirement and return to the public eye as the fiendishly evil Hannibal the Cannibal.Words like disgusting, visceral, gruesome, and shocking only begin to describe the horrors which Hannibal possesses and displays in two hours of deranged disgust.This is a movie where you have to take it as it is and accept some of the facts. I'm talking, mainly, about certain things beyond the films control like recastings. The absence of Jodie Foster is a major disappointment for the film. As much as I like Julianne Moore, she is no Jodie Foster. The most bothersome thing about her performance is her attempts to be like Jodie Foster, especially in an accent that Foster mastered, but Moore attempted with half-hearted effort. Her accent drops in and out during the film and so does her attitude and persona. I couldn't accept that this character was still Clarice Starling, a character that was played to such perfection by Foster. The films replacement of director was also a bit disappointing. Jonathan Demme shot The Silence of the Lambs in such an intense and harrowing style that I couldn't see anyone else getting right. Ridley Scott turns Hannibal into more of an action film than a suspense. Hannibal doesn't have the same atmosphere as The Silence of the Lambs and I'm not sure that it even tried. It seems Scott went in a much different direction here and it is a direction that is interesting, while not as masterful as what Demme did in his film. But again, these are all circumstances more or less beyond the films control.There are flaws in Hannibal that are within the films control. It has a script that is sharp and sophisticated at times, while also a little ridiculous at other times. I enjoyed the plot of Hannibal for what it was, but I can't deny that it grows more and more absurd as it draws closer to the end. The film tends to focus more on being shockingly gruesome rather than making sense. A lot of insanity is thrown our way as the plot develops and it becomes less and less believable. The film isn't difficult to follow and it always stays rooted in a loose sense of believability, but many scenes are a bit of a stretch, making this film more exploitive than artistic like its predecessor.But despite all its flaws Hannibal is a devilishly entertaining film. Its disgusting and visceral intensity delivers more than enough thrills to satisfy an appetite for sickening violence. I couldn't help but enjoy the film for what it was. I really only figured these flaws in retrospect. During the film I had a great time and was well entertained, albeit horrified. As a Hannibal Lecter film Hannibal is not quite as good as the masterpiece that came before it, but it is so much fun and it allows us to get the most out of the incredible Anthony Hopkins as one of the most fascinating villains of all time. Hannibal is a great watch despite all of its flaws. For anyone with a weak stomach they will surely hate this film, but I greatly enjoyed it as another sickening addition to the always intriguing Hannibal Lecter franchise.",Hannibal
110,wkozak221,very disturbing film.,1,6 June 2015,"This review contains several spoilers. If you do not want to know of them stop reading now! I watched this film to see how it compared to silence of the lambs. The former was very well done. However, this film should not have been made. The reason(s) I say this is towards the end of the film. When Dr. Lecktor removes the skull cap of ray liotta and frys part of his brain and feeds it to him is in my opinion sick! Also when he is on the plane and shows the Asian boy his lunch you know it is going to be very depraved. Because on top of a piece of lettuce are several pieces of brain matter. As the film fades you know Lecktor is going to get the boy to eat the brain matter as the film fades out. This film should not have been made in my opinion. I personally feel that they should have stopped at Manhunter with William Petersen because Dr. Lecktor was caught and behind bars where he should have been in the first place.",Hannibal
111,jon.h.ochiai,What happened here?,3,19 February 2001,"Great performances by Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore in a grotesque action/mood exercise that serves no point.  Even expertly directed by Ridley Scott, it's beautiful looking... garbage.  The story though adapted by David Mamet (yes, this is true) and Steven Zallian (""Searching for Bobby Fisher"", ""Schindler's List"") is just problematic even with the altered ending from the Thomas Harris novel.",Hannibal
112,TOMASBBloodhound,Mediocre adaptation of a mediocre book.,5,18 April 2006,"There are some times when too much just doesn't work. Considering all the talent involved in making ""Hannibal"", the results should have been excellent. Perhaps the biggest problem was with the source material. Thomas Harris did not hit a home run with his third novel dealing with Hannibal Lecter. The plot was convoluted, completely unrealistic, and almost completely obscured by the author's attempt to dazzle the reader with how much he knows about Florence, Italy. The script was re-written fifteen times. Three endings were filmed. Jodie Foster and Johnathan Demme backed out amidst the chaos. The final result has none of the magic of Silence of the Lambs or even Manhunter. Hopkins is still there, and he's a thrill to watch particularly during the scenes in Italy. Hopkins was originally skeptical of portraying Lecter once again, but it's amazing what $15 million will convince a man to do.The story picks up a few years after SOTL left off. Lecter has settled in Italy while Agent Starling is busy fighting crime with the FBI back home. An Italian detective finds out Lecter is working in a local museum and plans to hand him over to an old victim rather than arrest him. The former victim (a grossly disfigured Gary Oldman) is a wealthy sadist confined to a wheelchair on his sprawling estate. His plan is to feed Lecter to a pack of wild pigs that have been specially raised for just this event!!! Yes! It's amazing what those rich sadists will come up with when they're looking for revenge. After the detective fails to capture Lecter in Italy, Lecter heads on back to the USA to apparently try and hook up with Agent Starling who he has a thing for. Starling is trying to capture Lecter and prevent his former victim from murdering him. As you can see, the plot is ripe for any criticism one wishes to throw its way. The action plays out well in some scenes, but poorly during the latter half hour when it mattered the most.A big problem this film has is with its moralizing attitude it takes with Lecter. We are actually supposed to care about this brutal murderer of god knows how many people. We are supposed to sit and either laugh or cheer when he feeds Ray Liotta's own brains to him. The rich man trying to kill Lecter is painted as a man who would be better off dead himself, so we'd better hope Lecter gets away! The book is even more guilty of this moralizing by detailing Lecter's difficult childhood and pointing out how he only kills people who are ""rude"". Overall, it just doesn't work when your main character is an evil murderer. With SOTL and Manhunter, we had a serial killer on the outside who needed to be stopped. This film acts like things are fine and dandy with Lecter on the outside.Julianne Moore is a fine actress, but she's badly miscast here as Starling. It's nice to see Ray Liotta working again, but this part really did nothing for him, either. This film was obviously a mess from the get-go, but I'd blame Thomas Harris more than anyone else. He gave us a novel that just could not be made into a very good film.5 of 10 stars.The Hound.",Hannibal
113,stamper,Getting sick in the theatre due to the content of this film my bottom!!!,8,30 April 2001,"This really is a highly enjoyable film and I will refrain from comparing it to The Silence of the Lambs for a number of reasons. First of all this film can be watched without having seen Silence', second of all I do not remember how I liked Silence' and third Jodie Foster has been replaced so that Clarice Starling is now played by Julianne Moore, who I think was very brave to play this character. I mean it is a pretty big risk for an actress to play a character that has previously been played by Jodie Foster. And be honest Jodie Foster was good as Starling. But not only that Julianne Moore was kind of famous and established as an actress before this movie came out. I mean she had (big and small roles) in Box  office hits and critically acclaimed films, like The Fugitive, The Lost World, Nine Months, Benny & Joon and Boogie Nights. All of which were in my opinion enjoyable (except for The Lost World) plus they showed that she is a good actress. Now taking that job was risky, if she'd spoil the character it would be trouble for her, but chances were she would nail it and that is exactly what she did. After a while you probably will be thinking: Jodie Foster or Julianne Moore, who cares?' just like I did. I myself thought she was believable and played her character well.
But onto the movie which is, I must add a bit slow paced in the first half, which by the way does not mean it is boring. It is good for a film in which nothing happens. The second half on the contrary is much more eventful and finally has some gore in it. The gore that (so claimed the newspapers here in the Netherlands) made people sick in the theatre in Italy I think. The gory scenes that made theatre owners reschedule the break (yes in the Netherlands there is a break between the first and second half of the movie). The scenes that probably had Julianne Moore taking psychological counseling after the movie (or was it rather the whole theme and setup of the movie?). Well all I can say is blah, blah, blah. These IMPORTANT reports, were in my opinion nothing more than cheap marketing, an alternative to Trailers and Teasers. I mean what gets you interested more in a thriller than the fact that it is even thrilling to the actors, a film that is so gory, people throw up? NOTHING, that's right NOTHING. Well onto the gore, which is I must say pretty gory, but nothing to get sick off. Plus it really is filmed, choreographed and acted in a sublime way (Bravo Mr. Hopkins and Mr. Scott). As I am talking about Anthony Hopkins anyway. I think he did a great job in performing Hannibal Lecter. Another thing that struck me was the incredible mask on Mr. Verger (Gary Oldman) whom I really did not recognize at all. I mean this is a man I've seen in a dozen films or so, but it was also a man who was mutilated' beyond any recognition. All in all a good film. I can't wait to see Nr. 3 in the series (please, do not change any of the cast, I rather enjoyed seeing Mrs. Moore in this one).

114,ivo-cobra8,OK sequel to the classic best psychological thriller The Silence of the Lambs and also a good movie!,6,12 June 2016,"Hannibal (2001) is an OK sequel movie to Dr. Hannibal Lecter movie series. I like this film a bit, the first time I saw it, I hate it and I was really disappointed with this flick. This film in my opinion is a big step down from the classic film The Silence of the Lambs (1991). It is Ridley Scott film and I think he didn't do a terrible job directing this film. The sequel is based on Thomas Harris novel with the same name. Is Hannibal a classic? No! Is Hannibal the best film? No! Is Hannibal a great film? No! Is it an awful terrible movie? No! It is a good, bad film! We have new actors in this movie Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling does a really good job I like her a lot. Julianne Moore also started in a Jurassic Park sequel film The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997) as Dr. Sarah Harding. Seriously I like her character Sarah in Jurassic Park II. But playing Clarice Starling I like her less. The only Clarice Starling for me will always be Jodie Foster not Julianne Moore! Jodie Foster should play in this film, that was one reasons why I was disappointed with this flick. Watching the third time in the row, I must say it is an OK film, not a classic but an OK film. We have Anthony Hopkins returning in this film with his character Dr. Hannibal Lecter from The Silence of the Lambs so I am taking this film. Is not my favorite film in the franchise, that would still be The Silence of the Lams, Red Dragon and Manhunter but not Hannibal.Plot: Living in exile, Hannibal Lecter tries to reconnect with now disgraced FBI agent Clarice Starling and finds himself a target for revenge from a powerful victim. I like that Anthony Hopkins returned in this film with his character I liked his brilliant performance. I like the action sequences in this film, the shootouts and wearing a hand guns in this movie. I like Julianne Moore in this movie her character was really well good written. Like she cared everything that happens in this film, she kills like 4 people who are criminals in self defense. I had no idea Gary Oldman was in this film as another villain. He had such a mask and make up on that I did not recognized him. I heard somewhere that Mason Verger was written to had sister but the idea was cut and dropped out from the film. I like that FBI Special Agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore) uses a SIG-Sauer P226 as her duty firearm. It is predominately featured in the opening fish market shootout. At the time, the P226 was the standard issue sidearm for the FBI. DC Metro Detective Bolton (Terry Serpico) also carries one, and tips off the Drumgo gang in the fish market by drawing his weapon in view of the gang, despite Starling's orders to hold back. I like the rescue mission Clarice goes back rescuing Hannibal from Mason. I really like that they make a lot of changes in this film from the novel. Like Hannibal and Clarice did not become lovers in this film that was awesome and fantastic! I also like that even Clarice was drugged by Hannibal she still fight him when she handcuff him before Hannibal lock her hair in a freezer and broke the locker, that scene was awesome. I like that Hannibal only kills bad guys in this film and not any innocent people. Things I really don't like: The pacing is to slow at points and the film's tone is wildly inconsistent, the movie is too long for me. Ridley Scott has incredible lousy taste of music. The music theme from Hans Zimmer was terrible in this movie. Mostly I heard was a classic music playing, but where is any good song playing in this film? Manhunter and The Silence of the Lambs had beautiful songs playing in the movie this one didn't. Julianne Moore is no Jodie Foster. Where is Jack Crawford in this film? He should be written in this film, what happened to Jack Crawford? Hannibal Lecter escapes again and Clarice could do nothing, when she was drugged.How the heck did Clarice save her self when she was drugged and Hannibal locked her hair in a freezer and he brooked the lock for the freezer I don't know how she walked unharmed out. I didn't like the hanging the Pazzi out. Hannibal is eating Paul (Ray Liotta)'s brains was gruesome, I almost puked. I like this film, I like Julianne Moore giving her best at acting performance and making a good job. I like and I don't like this film the same time. So the rating for this film I am giving is a 6 out of 10 and I don't agree with critics that it is an awful movie it is definitely not! Hannibal is a 2001 American crime thriller film directed by Ridley Scott, adapted from the novel of the same name by Thomas Harris.

116,The_Movie_Cat,"""I've been giving a lot of thought ... towards eating your wife.""",5,28 February 2001,"So says Anthony Hopkins to a man whose wife has found him charming. Yes, that's right, Hannibal has started doing gags. A double entendre, sort of like Carry On Cannibal. And, while this recreation of his '91 role isn't quite the ultimate distillation of camp that reviews may have led you to believe, we're surely just two sequels away from Hannibal vs. Jason.
WARNING: REST OF REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS. ONLY READ IF YOU'VE SEEN THE FILMEasily the weakest of the Lecter trilogy, this follows on from Manhunter and the infamous Silence of the Lambs. Manhunter (6) was a brooding, low-key, though never intense, thriller, with all the hallmarks of a TV movie, despite striking direction. William L. Peterson impressed as the FBI agent, though Ronny Cox failed to get a grip on Lecter (or Lecktor as he was known in that particular picture). While Manhunter may have flirted with the mainstream, it never got into bed and had its babies the way Silence did. Jodie Foster's non-return to the Starling role for Hannibal makes it easier to accept Manhunter as part of the franchise; if Starling can be portrayed by two actors then Hannibal can be as well.For Silence of the Lambs (7) Jodie Foster received top billing, something which Hopkins' performance ensured wouldn't happen if they appeared together again; though both won Oscars for sterling work. It's a wonderfully observed performance, managing to stay just the right side of ham, and, crucially, unlike Cox's rather listless Lecktor, Hopkins maintains unwavering eye contact throughout. Initial viewings may disappoint with what turns out to be a relatively minor role for Lecter, though his nine scenes are still six more than Brian Cox had. Some unusual casting sees Chris Isaac and Roger Corman in minor roles, though the only real sticking point is Anthony Heald as the institute boss, who gives a performance too fey and silly to really fit in with the surroundings. Finally, the film opens and closes with the gentle sound of bird song. A nice touch.And so this takes us to Hannibal, the outright proof that less is certainly more. Hopkins appears - after an absence from pretty much all of the first half an hour  almost constantly. A mere eight blinks were permitted for his debut in the role; here he blinks a total of fifty-six times. In fact, so unstudied is the part this time around that he comes across more as his role of Richard Nixon or that advert he did for Barclays, rather than an insane genius murderer.This being Ridley Scott, the direction is of course well above average, though a little too overstated for this sort of thing, as is the subject matter. Everything inherent within Silence is here dragged out of the subtext, a spotlight shone on it and flogged to death. Julianne Moore does reasonably well in recreating Starling; so much so that after seeing her befreckled appearance you almost forget that Foster actually had dyed black hair when she played it. The undeclared love, or mutual dependency, of the two in the prior film is here expanded to a full-out romance, Lecter even drafting a love letter to the agent. His teasing of her Southern origins now seems childish and forced, while the singular plot narrative doesn't really go anywhere. In Silence they briefly touched hands; here they practically date and actually get a full-blown snog before the runtime is up.The classical and religious references are here overblown and silly (Look out for Hopkins in ""crucified"" pose), while the characterisation is now so twee he gets to say things like ""Ta-ta!"" and ""okey-dokey!"" OKEY-DOKEY??? Can you really imagine Hannibal Lecter saying ""Okey-Dokey""??? You don't have to  you can see it. Twice.While you sit through the film and realise this is a series that has now disappeared into hopeless self-parody you can hang on to the fact that it's still mediocre... at least until the final scenes. Perhaps inspired by The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Lecter serves up one of the most bizarre dinnertable sequences in movie history. Less Guess Who's Coming To Dinner, more Guess Who's Dinner, Ray Liotta sits around cracking jokes and one-liners while his skull is opened and his frontal lobes are served up for deserts. Or perhaps that should be just deserts, as Liotta is a very slimy boo-hiss villain throughout. Hopkins dutifully chows down on fried brain cells with comic intent, making it not food for thought, but thought for food. The special effects used to create this ""severed skull"" look are extraordinarily good, but highlight the film's proclivity towards excessive gore. Not only that, but it's just too silly, too smug, too self-congratulatory.If this was a stand-alone film then it would be worthwhile. It's still by no means a bad film, but following on from its predecessors it cannot help but feel like a betrayal. 5/10.",Hannibal
117,SmileysWorld,Another sequel that doesn't measure up.,5,14 September 2001,"Normally,I am a little apprehensive about viewing a sequel to a great film,because 9 times out of 10 those sequels end up ruining my good impressions of the original film. ""Hannibal"" is certainly no exception to this.In ""Silence of the Lambs"",Anthony Hopkins put forth the best acting performance of his career as the diabolical Lecter.What helped him do this is the fact that the Lecter character spent most of his time in the film incarcerated.He was limited as to what he could do physically,therefore he used words and eye contact to frighten us.He did this very well.In the sequel,however,Lecter is on the loose and actually performing his evil,and this to me makes him less frightening.As for Julianne Moore,she gives a top notch performance as Starling,but Jodie Foster is still the sentimental favorite.Watch if you must,but I recommend you stick with the original and just use your imagination.It will probably turn out better.",Hannibal
118,fernandoschiavi,"Ridley Scott crosses opera and cinema B to create a work that, if it doesn't reach excellence, has its flashes of originality and a large dose of competence",7,11 October 2021,"A sequel to the classic and multiple Academy Award-winning the Silence of the Lambs (1991), Hannibal was eagerly awaited in theaters in 2001, the year of his debut. Contrary to expectations, the sequel to The Silence of the Lambs took a while to come. However, almost 10 years later, the book is written and the adaptation is announced with enthusiasm. With Ridley Scott (Gladiator, Blade Runner) directing and Anthony Hopkins back in the character that earned him an Oscar, all that was left was Jodie Foster who, strangely, turned down the film after reading the script. The first suspicion that something wasn't right surfaced, but the doubts soon dissipated when she learned that Julianne Moore (nominated for an Oscar for best actress for The End of the Affair, 1999) had accepted the role.If he chose to reliably adapt the novel that serves as a starting point, the filmmaker Ridley Scott and his production team would have much greater problems to face, after all, the outcome of the book, practically impossible to become something of a cinematographic nature within the system of Hollywood production is overly confusing, off the rails and unreasonably supernatural. It just doesn't work well in the book itself and in the movies it would be even more catastrophic. The way was to adapt. Steven Zaillian, invited for the Inter Semiotics translation, had support from David Mamet in some points of the dramatic material, but the veteran seems to have faced problems in the production and, at least in the documentaries and official fact sheets, he doesn't appear properly credited.Hannibal"", unlike Brett Ratner's ""Red Dragon"" (a great movie, it's worth noting), doesn't want to emulate ""The Silence of the Lambs"". Not a context for quid pro quo games, Clarice Starling is no longer an agent in training. As sought after by the FBI as Osama Bin Laden, Dr. Hannibal Lecter is the protagonist of this story, Clarice being just a bait for Mason Verger (Gary Oldman) to get revenge for a relationship in the past that resulted in the disfigurement of his entire life. Face. Therefore, we have here a narrative that corresponds more to the reality now experienced by Hannibal than by Clarice. It's an exquisite setting, with beautiful locations in Italy, the refuge that Hannibal adopts as home. But there's also graphic violence as a choice to respect the primal nature Ridley Scott envisions for this fascinating character, including wild boars, scalpels, hypnotic drugs, disemboweled bodies, and a final menu to provoke discomfort. Generally speaking, one of the strongest points of this film is the fascinating figure of Hannibal, a seductive character, participants of intelligent dialogues and erudite posture that is purposefully paradoxical to his criminal acts as a cannibal. It's his enigmatic presence that creates curiosity and why not, some fascination. By repeating his syllabled tone with words, as in the previous film, Hopkins definitely becomes one of the most engaging characters in modern cinema.If we can say that there is a problem with Hannibal, perhaps this is not exactly the script of Steven Zaillian, accused of suspending subtleties in favor of more graphic violence. This was perhaps a choice made by filmmaker Ridley Scott. When Hannibal, for example, rehearses revenge involving the character played by Ray Liotta, a rogue policeman, the camera follows the psychiatrist step by step in developing his plan. There is no surprise, there is no atmosphere of suspense, as there is no longer any doubt about what will happen, after all, not only do we know that Paul Krendler will be the cannibal's dinner, but we even imagine how.Another small, ""however"" dramatic one that makes us believe in certain forced facts of the film is Clarice's police raid. She went wrong, but where are the witnesses to prove that the character acted in the right way, being snubbed by the team that was there? 2001 already marked a virtual era that was very present throughout the world. And finally, how does Hannibal Lecter, one of the ten most wanted criminals in the world, walk around Europe calmly, operating in a place of intellectuals, probably readers and researchers, generally informed about what goes on in media culture? These are small details that, for the most demanding, may sound like an absence of answers, but I believe it has to do with the proposal to insert ""fantastic"" and ""supernatural"" elements in the film, after all, Hannibal itself is a powerful entity. Resolved, these issues are just details that don't get in the way of the film's conduct. Still on the script, we have to highlight the choices to compose Clarice, a character who remains lonely, played with great dedication by Julianne Moore, a versatile chameleon, an actress who did the job, after all, replacing Jodie Foster is not a mission for just anyone. .Scott also does a competent job of building tension throughout the plot, relying on effective editing. However, even with the blind chase scene in the basement mimicking what had already been done at the climax of The Silence of the Lambs, the former still stands out when it comes to leaving the viewer breathless. This is perhaps because Hannibal is much less cinematic and much more operatic than his predecessor, or even most titles in his genre. The director takes advantage of his protagonist's taste for opera - including in the first scene - to create a photograph of theatrical lighting, colorful and exaggerated dinners and characters that, especially when Hannibal dominates the screen, transit throughout the scenic space, from unnatural form, but well suited to operatic language. The impression that Hopkins will begin to sing an aria occurs more than once during the little more than two hours of duration. While this gives the project a unique look, it also makes it a little slower and more indirect than a conventional thriller.Even having a cinema masterpiece as a base and the weight of a fantastic character played by an equally incredible actor, Hannibal (2001) cannot achieve the same talent as his predecessor. The first big scare in the film is the exchange of Jodie Foster for Julianne Moore, in the role of Clarice Starling. Many might point to Foster as a more endearing and interesting Clarice, others might say Moore brought in a denser Clarice. As much as Clarice de Foster earned an Oscar and, in fact, has something more, the characters they brought to the screen are very different and, in relation to the film they are in, they were consistent.In Silence of the Innocents, Clarice was new, inexperienced, dreamy and had every willingness to face the world, as often as necessary. In Hannibal, 10 years later, Clarice is tired. For 10 years she has been fighting a bunch of men and a bunch of criminals at the same time. And for what? For her career to be destroyed because a man's ego refused to accept an order. Hannibal was delicate when he brought up the subject in the film or perhaps it was the script trying not to get into the subject directly. He mentions that she loves an agency that doesn't love her back, but the character's problem is the same as 10 years ago: a macho world that refuses to let her through. Except when Paul offered to have an affair with her, again, the film agreed to get into the subject a little more directly. But, in general, Clarice's sexist world, which was a fundamental part of Silêncio dos Inocentes, was between the lines of this film. Unfortunately,. But the movie was quite successful in structuring the character for this movie, leaving her tired and dissatisfied. Clarice didn't just want her FBI restitution for hunting Hannibal. She wanted glory again. The same one she tasted when she killed Bufallo Bill, however, this time aimed at Hannibal.The second neglect is in our dear cannibal. He is no longer that cold creature that was capable of causing chills in the soul that we know in Silence. Here, he was reduced to a predator with refined taste and unparalleled humor. His whole story in Italy was interesting and Verger's grip on the character is great. The character, unfortunately, was cornered throughout the film, only putting his face out in the last moments. The film's climax, Starling's dinner, despite being its best part is also, somewhat, its downfall. As flawless as the entire scene is, her and the film's conclusion left a lot to be desired. After finally including moments of psychological clash between the characters, the script took Hannibal to a villain position and his redemption by cutting off his own hand. And he just walks away. The film ends almost without delivering an ending.Still regarding the technical aspects, this charming atmosphere is the result of careful photographic and scenography work, but we also have the spectacular geography of Florence, a space for a part of history, a place with a medieval past of violence, ideal to compose the erudition atmosphere, corruption and crime that involves the characters. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack is another hit, not being operatic like Howard Shore's work in the predecessor, but managing to bring to the story a different tone, its own, equally functional for the film presented to us. In addition to Bach's Goldberg Variations, there is a version of the classic Blue Danube accompanying a scene by the disfigured Mason Verger, an ironic passage, just like the character that titles the story. The editing, also very efficient, is well regulated and manages to give a dynamic atmosphere to the film, with bold choices and bets that demonstrate the search for the construction of something artistically audacious, without strings attached to please a certain segment of the audience. The feature film is worth checking out because of the very interesting way in which Ridley Scott crosses opera and cinema B to create a work that, if it doesn't reach excellence, has its flashes of originality and a large dose of competence.",Hannibal
119,Angry_Arguer,Renaissance Dracula,10,8 April 2004,"This is probably the most first, great misunderstood film of the decade.  So many enter expecting the original and thus come out disappointed.  Why? First, they ignore that this is a Ridley Scott movie.  Second, this plays on a different atmosphere much like how Cameron changed tones when he made 'ALIENS'.  This is your only spoiler warning...The first time, Demme played off of the ""perverted America"" concept. Hannibal ran as a parallel to the activities going on ""on the outside"".  He serves as Foster's personal ""think tank"".  The two existed in a parallel world where we experienced with them, not just watching them.  Hence Demme's method of actors looking AT the camera and not PAST the camera--which is what Scott--enthralled us.With 'Hannibal', the entire experience is reversed.  Scott runs a narrative parallel to reality while the actors exploit this differently.  Giannini expertly occupies the Scott's space like Curry in 'Legend'.  Moore acts, knowing what we should hear (pity about the accent).  Oldman knows where our perspective comes from.  He is a pro at living in these parallel  universes having done so in 'JFK', 'Rosencrantz', and 'Professional'.  Unfortunately, Hopkins misunderstands Scott with his holier-than-thou attitude.  Thus he's only half as effective this time.  That's puzzling since he dealt with Attenborough in 'Bridge Too Far' under a similar style of direction.Further than that, 'Hannibal' is also concerned about extravagant taste. Renaissance art is rife with such romanticized depravity that the film incorporates that aspect.  Hence the Florentine setting.Some things to be said about Scott's crew--the 'Gladiator' ensemble.  Zimmer isn't as rich this time and Mathieson hasn't proved himself a worthy follow-up to Scott's prior photographers.  Fortunately, after the poor sound editing that was 'Gladiator', we get the 'Face/Off' team to make up for it and Pietro understands Scott all the way.There is some self-reference involving Scott as Hannibal, the manipulator, but not as daring as 'Legend'.  There it was Mia being the subtle manipulator.  Yes, there's also the play-within-play and film-within-film. Big deal.Final Analysis = = Learn from this...",Hannibal
120,Ruskington,From sweetbreads to Big Mac,5,23 August 2020,"The only thing I hate more than a sequel is a sequel to an all-time classic. Throw in a replacement actor for a major role and you have my idea of cinematic sacrilege.As a stand-alone film, Hannibal is fine. Not great but perfectly fine. It's completely over the top and lacks all the subtlety of Silence of the Lambs but it's still terrifying, engaging and extremely well-acted. I also think that Julianne Moore does an excellent job as Starling. In my eyes, the movie should have been canned the minute Jodie Foster turned it down but as it goes, Moore does as well as anybody possibly could.That being said, I genuinely hate the fact that this movie was ever attempted and I hate that every aspect of it is completely overblown- from the ridiculous Bond-villain Mason Verger to the trope sexist pig played by the under-utilised Ray Liotta. And let's not forget that ridiculous finale which forsakes the depth of Hopkins' character in exchange for some cheap shock-value.A poor effort from Ridley Scott, and yet another case for sequels to classic films being made a federal crime.",Hannibal
121,spookyrat1,From Florence With Love!,8,20 February 2019,"Even with the benefit of hindsight, if for whatever reasons Jonathan Demme and Jodie Foster didn't wish to reprise their Silence of the Lambs roles, master visual storyteller, Ridley Scott, would have always been an extremely safe choice to take up the directorial reins of a sequel. And what a fine sequel he succeeds in creating! I haven't read Thomas Harris's Hannibal, upon which this adaption was based, but I'm confident that Scott's interpretation honours the spirit of Harris's lead characters, whilst allowing Scott to leave his own indelible, artistic hallmarks on the project.Placing the exiled Hannibal in Florence, historically considered the birthplace of the Renaissance, is a masterstroke. For much of Silence the good doctor was confined to his jail cell and the audience had to imagine his refined and highly-cultured attractions, beyond those of his victims. In a city internationally renowned for its culture, art, architecture, monuments, numerous museums and art galleries, Hannibal is able to live the dream so to speak and at the beginning of the film has successfully done so, for the previous decade. Scott of course as is his habit, provides a sumptuous visual treat in setting the whole second act of Hannibal on location in central Florence, making optimal use of the World Heritage listed locations. It's a hoot for instance seeing ""Dr Fell"" giving lectures on the classics at the Palazzo Vecchio and yet, at the same time, appears an eminently reasonable scenario.Naturally this causes a reduction in focus on Clarice Starling, a move with which many critics take issue. Not for me! The first film was seen through Starling's perspective and she was the central character. This film, as the title reminds us, is primarily about Hannibal himself and his interrelationships with Mason Verger, Detective Rinaldo Pazzi and of course Starling, beautifully played by Julieanne Moore, channelling Jodie Foster's Clarice extremely smoothly.I think Scott again makes the right decisions in the third act, changing the book's final dynamic between Hannibal and Clarice. I also love the way he has visually elaborated upon that very famous quotation from Silence ... ""A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti.""... with Ray Liotta's corrupt Justice Department official Paul Krendler, substituting this time for the census taker. Wickedly humorous, but suspenseful at the same time!I personally would have enjoyed seeing Scott Glenn a second time around, playing Jack Crawford, but perhaps Crawford isn't included in the book.Ultimately I can't complain at all. Ridley Scott has created a terrific follow-up tale to Demme's groundbreaking first episode. It's superbly acted, stylishly filmed and never fails to be tantalizingly engrossing.",Hannibal

Anthony Hopkins does a great job reprising his role as the infamous and notorious Hannibal Lecter and Julianne Moore is good, taking the place of Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling. I still feel that the movie would have been better had Jodie Foster played Starling, the film was still everything I wanted it to be and more!It has the buckets of blood and violence and the wonderfully developed plot. The screenplay, adapted from Thomas Harris' novel was very well written and the art direction was great! I love the way Lecter uses the past and history to tell some stories of genuine horror and to make his victims feel totally creeped out and how he always manages to stay calm and suave. He really is the world's most notorious gentleman.No one else could have done this vision like how Ridley Scott did. He creates the eerie and chilling mood and so does the haunting score. If you were a fan of the original THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, then you must see this film! I know many people found it to be disappointing, but those are mostly the people who have read the book. If you are one of those people that does not want to see the movies because you liked the books and are afraid of being disappointed, then that's fine. Even the author, Thomas Harris has not viewed the films, because he is afraid it would influence his writing. But if you have not read the books, or if you are not afraid of being disappointed, then see HANNIBAL! This movie is awesome!HANNIBAL gets 5/5.",Hannibal
123,Libretio,Honest-to-goodness Hollywood horror movie,6,4 January 2005,"HANNIBAL Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDSWhile its predecessor THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS was more of a police procedural with Gothic trimmings, Ridley Scott's follow-up HANNIBAL is an honest-to-goodness horror movie, one of the most gruesome Hollywood offerings in recent memory. Anthony Hopkins reprises his celebrated role of cannibalistic psychopath Dr. Hannibal Lecter, forced out of 'retirement' in Florence, Italy, after being targeted for kidnap by one of his former victims (the only person to have survived one of Lecter's attacks, now hideously disfigured, and played by Gary Oldman beneath layers of Greg Cannom's horrific makeup), seeking revenge on his old adversary. Julianne Moore replaces Jodie Foster as FBI agent Clarice Starling, torn between her fascination with Lecter and her devotion to duty, despite the obstacles she faces from her self-serving male colleagues.Beautifully designed (by Norris Spencer, David Crank and Marco Trentini) and photographed (by John Mathieson), the film's labyrinthine script - by Steven Zaillian and David Mamet - is ruthless in its depiction of human frailty and corruption (especially Moore's battles against an inflexible bureaucracy run by fools and charlatans), which makes it difficult to root for anyone other than Lecter, whose contempt for authority is manifested in crowd-pleasing acts of grisly murder. Like the Thomas Harris novel on which it's based, the movie is Argentoesque in both its plotting and execution, and some of the Grand Guignol set-pieces would be comic if they weren't so distressing (the notorious 'banquet' scene is truly grotesque). Unpleasant for some, a visual feast for others, HANNIBAL offers a stately riposte to the ice-cold authority of Jonathan Demme's original, but some viewers may be alarmed by the film's enthusiastic (though never gratuitous) depiction of horror and brutality.

Will justice catch up with him?One of these films where they should have made a documentary about the making of the movie and dumped the product. For those living under a rock - this is a follow up to the overrated Silence of the Lambs - a Best Picture Oscar winning movie of the 90's. This ploughed a furrow of having a horrible killer for the boys and a strong female leaded for the girls and then using them to produce a cranked-up thriller with star performances.Original star Jodie Foster (Agent Starling) fell away from this movie (she didn't like aspects of the script, although she admitted the cheque would look good in the right light!) and I can see why. This is not really a follow up more a different movie with a different perspective: Lector at-large rather than behind bullet proof glass and Starling seeming to have lost her grip on common sense.What we have here - sadly - is a horror movie with a lot of pretencion!FBI Agent Starling is now in the Guiness Book of Records (no joke) as the agent with the most kills and is banished from the force for shooting a mother (with baby) who clearly shoots first. Julianne Moore doesn't know what to do with the character (when not running and jumping) and decides to play it as a kind of female Clint Eastwood - taking the unjust blows on the chin and not complaining too much.Lector (who is played by an unknown actor called Antony ""Call Me Tony"" Hopkins), meanwhile is living in Florence as loose-as-a-goose, taking a high profile job, going to the theatre and making guest appearances on the Muppet Show (ok the last one IS a joke - but it is the last promise.) He has even thrown away that silly blonde wig he tried on in the Silence of the Lambs.Other parties are after him too: Including a billionaire (Gary Oldman - but it could be anyone!) with a fully scared face who has had a bad experience (are there any other type?) with the old doctor and wants to get even.Thrillers have to thrill, but all the authors have is old material. The outcast cop who seems lax with her own personal security. The crazy billionaire. The incompetent bosses (one of them is Ray Liotta so KNOW something crazy is going to happen involving him - why else would he be here?) The spooky house. The sudden appearance out of shadows. The killer with a streak of poetic justice - need I go on?I was told this movie was bad before I saw it. I am glad. Knowing this allowed me to think ""it isn't as bad as all that"" and it isn't. Slow moving yes, but we can only have so much blood and guts in two hours.

SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is one of the very greatest thrillers ever made, and when this sequel appeared people were blown away looking forward to it. But - Hannibal and his disgusting methods of thrills has really lost about everything since the early 90ties. Anthony Hopkins is still in the performance as the psychotic cannibal doctor Hannibal. Jodie Foster did a very smart move thanking no to playing Starling again, this time it's the far less skilled actress Julianne Moore. We also meet Gary Oldman as a mangled, old rich-man and Ray Liotta as a detective. The movie is directed by Ridley Scott, Jonathan Demme were also a smart kiddo.Hannibal Lecter is living in Italy by selling paintings. Although the top notch agents are hunting him, he is living peaceful. But; a not too good looking Mason Verger are hungering for great vengeance over Lecter, after he made him spoil his face totally with a knife. Wanting this terrible revenge he has to tempt Hannibal back to America, but how? Only in one way; Lecter's only weak point, Agent Starling. The woman he loves...The movie is really not much of a exciting piece of film. It's NEVER elegant, nor smart or genuine. Although the dialogs and acting works okay, same with the directing the movie is really one of the worst sequels I've ever seen. The movie alone is a bit better then okay, but being the sequel of a masterpiece, it's really a nothing.

Initially I thought 'I wish they put a couple millions more in the budget just to secure Jodie returning' because even though I REALLY like Julianne Moore this is probably her worst performance ever.I think the problem is that she has to talk with the same thick Texan accent that Jodie did in the original that she gets so focused on getting that right that she lose her eye on making it sound convincingly as well, a lot of actors/actresses have that problem though.She's fine when she's just reacting, looking around etc but that doesn't help much.BUT the worst part of it is that it's horribly written with awful characters (not awful as in bad people just awfully written, even though yes most of them are awful as wel). A big part of the movie takes place in Italy and the Italian actors are terrible, perhaps because they have to speak a language that they seem to barely know and make that seem natural.And they are trying to do too much with the script taking far too much focus away from Hannibal Lecter and Clairice (Juliane Moore) a lot of the times, especially since she's still in the US in the many Italy scenes.And there's no real suspense either, the little there is is just cheap gross out scenes which granted are a bit disturbing at times but more in a I'm getting a queasy stomach feeling than a I'm peeing my pants scared kinda way.Anthony Hopkins is still decent and the black dress Julianne Moore wears is smoking but that is not enough to save this movie, and I understand why Jodie Foster didn't want to do it...

Perhaps those people discovered Hannibal played by Anthony Hopkins, hence they were eager to read the sequel. As for me I remember I read Silence of the Lambs before the movie. Well, I was not so enthusiast and knowing the story I only watch the movie with a distracted attention.The problem is Hannibal was the strongest character in Silence of the Lambs and above all for everything we had to imagine. Thus Hannibal was scarcely shown and Foster's Clarice had plenty of time to gain a foothold in the story wherever Hannibal was not. Now Hannibal is the very center of the movie so Julianne Moore can't do much better than the bland-and-mild agent Starling. What is more she has no such a foil as Scott Glenn to show she is a big girl.The movie is very good for all the dolce vitta Hannibal enjoys in Firenze. I think this is the most effective part of the movie. Actually I had developed a liking for the Italian actor (Giancarlo Giannini) playing inspector Pazzi. It was well developed but the story had to move on.An important point is the 'shock factor' as some early comments name it. Sure it visually shocks, but it's too much for the balance of the movie. I imagine that showing Mason Verger only for his final scene would have been better (and helped save on make-up).

131,DarthVoorhees,"""No Mason, No I much prefer you the way you are""",8,25 November 2010,"I recall reading Thomas Harris' Hannibal novel and thinking there was no plausible way it could be translated into film. It wasn't any fault to the novel which I thought was excellent in a macabre kind of way but simply because 'The Silence of the Lambs' is a gritty ultra-realistic masterpiece while 'Hannibal' is a demonic fantasy of a nightmare. To be clear I really enjoyed the novel but there are simply stories that don't translate to film. I was wrong in a way. Ridley Scott has truly done the best he could have with 'Hannibal'. It isn't as good as the novel or God forbid 'The Silence of the Lambs' but was that a real expectation? What we get is a slickly made and very well acted picture. It's gory, gruesome, and it goes way over the top but on those terms it works.What is it about Hannibal Lecter that fascinates us? I had my doubts that he would work behind the glass. Hopkins' performance is his worst turn as Lecter but that is really because the character as written isn't as interesting as a free man. The Hannibal in 'Red Dragon' and 'Silence of the Lambs' is much scarier because of the psychological damage he does. The character worked so well in 'Silence of the Lambs' because we knew he was building up to that ending. His eight years behind Plexiglas were spent devising horrible plans. The delight he took in destroying people without touching them was scary. Blood for the sake of blood isn't scary. Ironically, I don't think Hannibal Lecter embodies a sense of true evil as some do. The gentlemanly quality was the most frightening thing about him. He's the kind of spider that knew exactly how to lure in the fly. In 'Hannibal' Lecter is reduced to being nothing more than a boogeyman. It's disappointing to say the least. Gone for the most part are his predatory cunning, Machavellian problem solving, and mind games. There are moments when Hannibal slashes a knife much like a Freddy Krueger might. What Hopkins does though is make the best of the situation. There is a great wit to this performance. Hopkins is having a good time savoring the dark humor in the script. I also like that his Lecter here looks like an animal rather than the thin sickly man behind the glass. Hopkins delivers but in a different way. I found that this Hannibal has contempt for the world around him and smirks at whatever people threaten him with. Of course he lives but his freedom comes at a satisfying price.Julianne Moore is very good as Clarice Starling. One of the highlights of the 'Hannibal' novel was Harris' characterization. I like the fact that Clarice is bruised and views the world with disillusionment. I like the fact that there isn't a Jack Crawford figure to father her anymore. What I wish though is that Clarice was tempted by evil even in the least bit. Moore's Clarice although scarred still has that sense of right and wrong. I agree with Ridley Scott's decision to change the ending of the Harris novel. I must bring up the infamous ending of Harris 'Hannibal'. Is Lecter meant to be rewarded with Clarice? I don't know if I see it in those terms. In an odd way though 'Hannibal' is very faithful to the core concept behind their relationship. Clarice is the one thing Hannibal can't bring himself to fully destroy. That being said I'd like to see more evolution to the ending Scott envisioned. I don't know what this Starling thinks of Lecter. It seems as if she views him in this strict sense of right and wrong. Foster's Starling allowed herself to become dangerously close to Lecter. Does she love him? Did she ever? I don't want the answers to these questions but I'd like Scott to acknowledge that these questions exist.Oddly enough the best performance and relationship in the film belongs to Gary Oldman's Mason Verger. Hopkins and Oldman only share the scene for a brief moment but the moment is so satisfying in summing up Lecter. Verger was a pedophile who Lecter hypnotized into mutilating his face and hanging himself. Harris is wisely very vague in detailing the fine points when Lecter was active in Baltimore with his practice and in his prime. Verger is a brief hint into the horrors of this past. Verger was a much more interesting character in the novel and I am severely disappointed that Verger's sister Margot is omitted from the film. However, the Verger character is fascinating. Oldman's performance is multi-faceted. He's a pathetic being, he's funny, and yet we question who is the real monster in 'Hannibal'. Hannibal himself is a straight edge and has no internal or external conflict of identity or interest. Mason Verger is a character of many contradictions and is evil. We hate Mason's evil more though because he hurts others to do his will. In a odd way we view Lecter as not good but the only honest man in this world. Oldman's performance is key to this interpretation and he knocked it out of the park. He should have received mild Oscar consideration.",Hannibal

134,Movie-12,"Doesn't come close to the quality of the original, but Anthony Hopkins's performance saves the movie. *** (out of four)",7,15 February 2001,"HANNIBAL / (2001) *** (out of four)By Blake French:	Some movies are born to inspire sequels but ""The Silence of The Lambs"" is a movie that does not need a sequel. The Academy Award winning thriller earned ubiquitous critical acclaim, therefore a continuation is nearly incapable of living up  to its standards. To make things worse for the highly anticipated sequel ""Hannibal,"" the original film's director and main star bailed out, leaving Ridley Scott (""Gladiator"") and Julianne Moore (""Magnolia"") filling their places in the credits. It is hard to imagine how this movie could possibly succeed. But the exceptionally beautiful filmmaking, strong performances, intriguing story, and moody atmosphere provoke more nail-biting moments than most thrillers these days.	The story of ""Hannibal"" does not compare with ""The Silence of the Lambs."" It replaces tension-filled sequences of psychological terror with scenes featuring some of the most grotesque images and realistic gore to ever make its mark on the big screen. This film relies heavily on the shock factor of such extreme graphic violence, although such content is never excessive or relentless. It has perfect timing. The sheer presence of Anthony Hopkins, in another horrific and career defining performance, often creates enough terror for several movies. ""Hannibal"" knows that and frequently gives the character more freedom than he had in he first film. But I am not so sure that is a good thing; is it more terrifying listening to Hannibal Lecter discuss his disgusting actions or to actually see him perform such disturbing behaviors? 	The film takes place ten years after FBI agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster then, Julianne Moore now) interviewed convicted mass murdering cannibal Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) while searching for another disturbed killer. Present day: Clarice is involved with a drug bust shoot-out that leaves many dead. Justice Dept. Official Paul Krendler (Ray Liotta), is about to punish her when she gets a call from a the unrecognizably deformed surviving victim of an attack by Lecter. His name is Mason Verge  (Gary Oldman), a wealthy recluse who asks that Starling be placed back on the case of the Cannibal, who has been on the loose for ten years. 	The movie investigates a lot more than Clarice's experiences with Hannibal Lecter. The script actually consists of two separate stories, one detailing the revenge scheme of Mason, whom is still angry with Lecter after he caused the removal of his face and partial paralysis. The other takes place in Italy, where an inspector named Rinaldo Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini) is out to claim a multimillion dollar reward for providing authorities with proper evidence leading to the arrest of a local, who turns out to be none other than Lecter himself. Obviously this man does not know what he is in for, and ends up losing his cuts for the moneyliterally.  	Parallel stories are always interesting, but are easily sidetracked with certain characters and or events. What keeps this movie intriguing is the consistent focus on Lector; everything in the story seems to revolve around him. Then again, ""Hannibal"" is also quite pointless because it solves nothing. Without giving away the ending, I will say that we are once again left pondering about Lecter. Most any movie that provokes thoughts is worth seeing, but ""Hannibal"" forgets the first film, takes a stand on its own, and once again sets us up for another unnecessary follow-up.
	The most apparent conflict many audiences with have with ""Hannibal"" is the absence of Jodie Foster. Julianne Moore is most definitely a capable and challenging actress, and plays the role of Starling with exuberance and clarity. But Foster is simply better in the role and we miss her dearly. Anthony Hopkins saves the movie; the actor is so intense and grisly in his subtle and classy manner, he once again qualifies as an award nominee. Thank goodness he returned for the role; without Hopkins, ""Hannibal"" would be nothing but underdone carnage.",Hannibal

137,ctomvelu-1,Gruesome,6,5 November 2008,"I wrote about HANNIBAL when it first hit TV, but having just seen it again, I figured it's worth a second visit. This time around, Hannibal Lecter (a sadly aging Tony Hopkins) is being pursued by a victim who survived Lecter's loving ministrations but is badly disfigured (an unrecognizable Gary Oldman in a flamboyant role that does not do him justice). FBI agent Clarice Starling (a miscast Julianna Moore) is in serious trouble over a bad shootout, and is being hounded by a lecherous Feeb named Krendler (Ray Liotta, also oddly miscast). An Italian detective (the wonderful if very old Giancarlo Gianini) is hot on Lecter's trail. The action swings from Italy to America. The book was a hastily written disgrace, for which I have never forgiven the author. The movie is a loose adaptation of the novel and is maybe a notch above the book in quality. What director Ridley Scott is good for is creating atmosphere. The movie is a bit slow-moving but this actually plays in its favor. Lots of shadows and eerie lighting and odd angles abound. The violence and gore are extreme for a non-horror flick, although maybe we should view this Hannibal as just a nattily attired and coiffed Jason Vorhees or Michael Myers. He kills folks brutally and nastily. Highlights, for those so inclined, include brain-eating and a close encounter with a pack of 500-lb., long-tusked, man-eating hogs. Gorehounds may feast. All others beware. This is not SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, and Jodie Foster is sorely missed.",Hannibal

139,Rickting,A toothless and tasteless sequel to a far superior film,4,1 August 2016,"Although I was underwhelmed on my first viewing, the sheer terror and mesmerizing emotion in The Silence of the Lambs seriously got to me when I watched it again. This sequel is inferior in every way, with even Julianne Moore giving one of her weaker performances as Clarice Starling. The story, which is about a victim of Hannibal Lecter's using Starling to lure Hannibal out so he can exact revenge, lacks the bite of the original. Ridley Scott does his best with the thin material he has to work with, there are undeniably shocking and memorable moments and the film boasts 2 tremendous villainous performances. One is, of course, from Anthony Hopkins and the other is from Gary Oldman as the man trying to catch him although Oldman should have appeared more. The psychology and tension from TSOTL is gone, leaving Hannibal with only a collection of gross-out death scenes to scare viewers, but those gradually become tedious. The film is far too slow-paced for its own good, and in the end it's all highly anti-climatic since nothing that much actually happens and the conclusion, in many ways, settles nothing. It's a shame to end the Hannibal Lecter story here (There's never been a continuation of the story) and if you want a worthy successor, check out the surprisingly solid 2002 prequel, Red Dragon. 4/10",Hannibal

Here's some recommendations of other works by:RIDLEY SCOTT - his directorial debut ""Duellists, The"" 1977, with Keith Carradine and Harvey Keitel, costume swordsmen drama with beautiful foliage settings; and the very first ""Alien"" 1979; the fantasy sci-fi ""Blade Runner"" 1982; the incomparable ""Thelma and Louise"" 1991.ANTHONY HOPKINS - a more calming role in ""84 Charing Cross Road"" 1986, with Anne Bancroft, especially for book lovers; also ""Shadowlands"" 1993, with Debra Winger, based on true events.JULIANNE MOORE - in 1999, she gave substantial performances in 5 films: ""Cookie's Fortune"", "" Ideal Husband, An"", ""End of the Affair, The"", ""Map of the World, A"", ""Magnolia""; also try (""Velvet Goldmine"" 1998) director Todd Haynes' ""Safe"" 1995, you'd see Julianne Moore at her best.
GARY OLDMAN - he produced ""Contender, The"" 2000, gave a terrific performance as the nemesis opposite Joan Allen; try ""Romeo Is Bleeding"" 1993, playing opposite a feisty Lena Olin as the evil force.RAY LIOTTA - try him in Jonathan Demme's ""Something Wild"" 1986, deliciously wicked playing opposite Jeff Daniels and Melanie Griffith; of course, he's very good in Martin Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"" 1990.GIANCARLO GIANNINI - he has done numerous films with Italian writer-director Lina Wertmüller, like the controversial  ""Swept Away"" 1975; he was in (""Like Water for Chocolate"" 1992) Mexican director Alfonso Arau ""Walk in the Clouds, A"" 1995 with Keanu Reeves and Anthony Quinn.",Hannibal

146,jhaggardjr,Good but not great,7,25 February 2001,"""Hannibal"" is the long awaited sequel to the Oscar-winning 1991 movie ""The Silence of the Lambs"". It's a good film but can't match up to its predecessor. Anthony Hopkins reprises his Oscar-winning role as Dr. Hannibal Lecter, who as you may recall escaped from his jail cell in the original movie. 10 years after the events in ""Silence"", Hannibal is still at large and very much in hiding. FBI agent Clarice Starling (now played by Julianne Moore taking over for Jodie Foster) still wonders where he could be. One of the good things about ""Hannibal"" is the acting of course. Hopkins is back in fine form here, and Moore is good too (if not quite as compelling as Foster was in ""Silence""). There are other major assets as well. The story kept me interested throughout, the Italy locations are beautiful (where Lecter is hiding out), and the film score by Hans Zimmer is very creepy and suspensful. But one thing turned me off in ""Hannibal"", and that is the graphic violence although I expected to see it here. ""Silence of the Lambs"" was a violent movie too, but this one is more violent. There are some very gruesome and disturbing scenes in this film, and quite frankly I'm surprised that the movie wasn't slapped with an NC-17 rating. ""Hannibal"" is not loaded with one violent scene after another, but when the violence does comes into the picture, prepare to see lots of blood. Nevertheless, I'm just barely giving ""Hannibal"" a mild recommendation because inspite of all those disgusting moments, it's a well acted and gripping thriller. However, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a much better film.*** (out of four)",Hannibal

I can see why people might not like this movie as much but come on, it deserves way more than a 6.3 (AS OF 2/24/08). Hannibal was very different in this film, but also very similar. He has much more screen time, and in my opinion is much more sophisticated in this film. He is still played by the excellent Anthony Hopkins. Clarice Starling is thankfully played by Julianne Moore in this. The biggest creepy element about Lecter here is that hes not in the U.S. anymore but tapes and recordings of him still are and give a sort of eerie element. There are a lot of people after Lecter in this movie. The first and foremost is the FBI (mainly Clarice Starling). Also we have a rival of Lecter's, a victim who survived his torture named Mason Verger (Gary Oldman). We also have an agency in Italy after him, mainly Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini). Even Starling has a rival, Agent Paul Krendler(Ray Liotta). Everyone is well played and the kills are unique. Lecter really does a good job in this film of being evil yet being a protagonist. I recommend this to fans of the first who are open-minded enough to give this a chance. If you have an open mind you will enjoy this as much as if not more than the first.",Hannibal

I'm not squeamish about gore, but the brain-eating scene disgusted and disturbed me; kudos to the filmmakers for having the balls to show it, but it was a little too much. The story is decent until it goes off the rails at the end; the scenes in Venice are fine, but once the man-eating boars show up, it's a whole new game. The acting is pretty good, with Hopkins given much more to do and Julianne Moore creating her own Starling, rather than just copying Jodie Foster. An unrecognizable Gary Oldman is great as well in a superb makeup job. Ridley Scott does a good job of creating an atmosphere, but he wrecks it too many times with an over-abundance of gore.

153,theshadow908,"Entertaining, but extremely lacking.",6,12 July 2006,"Hannibal picks up 10 years after the events of The Silence of the Lambs. Hannibal escaped, and he is now hiding out in Italy, continuing his cannibalistic crime spree there. A former victim of Hannibal, Mason Verger, has hired a police detective to track him down and capture him, so he can have his revenge. Meanwhile, FBI Agent Clarice Starling has been disgraced due to a botched operation. When she receives a note from Hannibal, she begins trying to track him down. This movie is nowhere near as good as Silence of the Lambs, but it has its moments.The first thing wrong with this movie is that the style of film making and storytelling is vastly different. Whereas the first film managed to be disturbing, yet not excessively gory at the same time, this movie is more about the gore. It was a bold psychological thriller meant to make you think. Ridley Scott made this movie as a slasher movie, with scenes of gratuitous gore where it isn't necessary. He turned Hannibal from a highly intelligent sociopath to a highly intelligent serial slasher. It is nice to finally see Hannibal Lecter as the main antagonist, since the first two films had him confined to a cell helping the FBI with the capture of other serial killers. However, those stories were much more interesting than this one. This movie comes off as far more boring than the previous films.The acting isn't as good either. Julianne Moore comes nowhere close to portraying Clarice in the way Jodie Foster did. Foster made it her own character, whereas Julianne Moore desperately tries to copy Foster, and fails miserably. Ray Liotta is terrible in his role. Gary Oldman is mildly entertaining as Mason Verger. As for Anthony Hopkins, he's still a great actor, and he does good in this movie. However, he seems to have lost that creepy voice that made Hannibal memorable. Now he just speaks with his normal accent.Overall, this movie certainly has its moments, and I'd recommend it to people who liked Manhunter and The Silence of the Lambs, but be warned...It's nowhere near as good.6/10",Hannibal
154,Rammstein-2,Not worthy,4,6 March 2001,"Spoiler warning!There are three major mistakes which should have resulted in a no-go on ""Hannibal"". First up is the pointlessness. There is no point to the film, nothing new surfaces that one doesn't already know. The character development is very weak, most of it has taken place before the story starts, and the relationship between Hannibal and Clarice is just what one would expect: a love-hate relationship with some bizarre twists resulting in yet another unresolved ending which puts us back to square one: Hannibal is free again, and Clarice is stuck in the FBI basement sticking her Hannibal memorabilia on the walls. To make the film happen, a typical old-victim-wants-revenge plot has to be added (with some new plot elements, granted).The second mistake is replacing Foster with another actress. Julianne Moore is a very fine actress, there is nothing wrong with her - but she ain't no Jodie Foster. Replacing one with the other fails miserably, and I feel sorry for Moore who puts out a great performance that is eclipsed by the infinitely more subtle and amazing ditto of Foster a few years back. The third mistake is the entire last part of the film. Cooking Ray Liotta's brain may feel rewarding after having seen his awful character drool over Clarice for one and one half hour - but the entire deal is just too ridiculous and icky to be credible.""Hannibal"" is a failure. It's a movie with great actors and good performances and with a pointless, predictable plot. It draws all its force from ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and does a real bad job of preserving the legend of Hannibal the Cannibal. Ridley Scott should have picked something else to do.",Hannibal
155,nobbytatoes,misunderstood,8,30 October 2005,"Clarice Starling has become infamous in the FBI for having such a high death rate to her name. After a blood bath shot out on a drugs raid to arrest Evelda Drumgo, she is being reviewed on whether she is a worthy member of the FBI. She receives some reprise when she is asked to look back into the Hannibal Lecter case when new information is brought forward. The only surviving victim of Hannibal, Mason Verger, has information on Lecter, hoping that it will re-open the case. Verger is horribly disfigured in the face when Lecter had Verger cut his own face off.Meanwhile in Florence, we are brought into the new life of Hanibal Lecter. He is in a temporary job at the Capponi Library, when the former employee has mysteriously disappeared. On the case of the disappeared man is Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi. Rinaldo becomes suspicious of this new man, and after doing a background check finds that he is Hannibal Lecter. What interest Rinaldo more is the reward on Lecter's head, three million dollars. The reward is set up by Mason Verger. Verger has made its sole purpose to find Lecter and make him suffer a slow, painfully gruesome death. When Lecter finds that he has been found out, he returns back to America to face Verger and return to his one love; Clarice.Much like many sequels, this doesn't reach the pure brilliance of 'The Silence of the Lambs', but its still a very strong movie. Like the 'Silence', this is a hunt film, this time the hunt is for Lecter after he escaped from custody in 'Silence'. Hannibal is very different as well, as its not a thriller. Instead we have a dark twisted love story. Lecter is in essence an art socialite, he does live the elegant life, and this is seen through the elegantly stylish cinematography; 'silence' was about Clarice, Hannibal is about Hannibal Lecter, its his world we are seeing. Ridley Scott's direction is just perfect and he is suited very well for this movie; as Demme didn't reprise this sequel of his film.The violence of Hannibal, while it is confronting, isn't always in your face. We never see a lot of violence, but when we do it does come right at you. many have said this only relies on the violence, but it actually organically emerges from the story. We do open on a bloody shot out on the drug raid, but then no violence for ages. There isn't much blood till the end with the infamous 'brain sequence'. The story focuses mainly on the relationship of Lecter and Starling. They are like soul mates, but can never be together; its a love-hate relationship. Anthony Hopkins easily slips back into the role he made so famous. He still has that unnerving feel every time he talks, though doesn't quite have the confronting dialog he was given in 'Silence'. Julianne Moore fills in as Clarice very convincing, she has the same strength that Jodie Foster brought to Clarice in 'Silence'; though i was a shame Foster didn't reprise her role, but Moore takes the role and runs with it. Gary Oldman is chilling as the disfigured Verger, the first time you see his face is abit shocking, but its draw back is you don't get chills from it when you see his face again; so it does lose that impact.Though this isn't as thrilling as 'The Silence of the Lambs', this is still a great film. Its moody and dark, but is a great drama about the strange relationship between Starling and Lecter. A great watch.",Hannibal

After that, I saw Hannibal Rising which wasn't as good but I still thoroughly enjoyed quite a bit. Then came Red Dragon, the second best of the series in my opinion but still not as good as SOTL. I still haven't see Manhunter but I finally sat down and Hannibal for the first time tonight and I am a little let down to be quite honest. It didn't seem to get it right for some reason and left me wanting more. It's a good movie all in all but I think it could have been a lot better.The story is decent but definitely weak compared to Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon. Anthony Hopkins is great Hannibal Lecter, as usual, so no surprises there. Julianne Moore was good, I'm not gonna deny that, but she was no where near as good as Jodie Foster for the role and I'm pretty disappointed that Foster didn't reprise her role because it could have only made the film better as a whole. I also liked the gore in this one and effects. It's a pretty good way to spend a couple hours if you have nothing else to do.If you're a completest like I am, you probably want to see this film to finish the series off and I think you should. Don't expect a brilliant movie but get ready to enjoy a good story with some great dark comedy.",Hannibal
157,OttoVonB,the Cannibal's Symphony,6,7 February 2002,"9 years after his dramatic escape, Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins) is free in Florence with a bounty on his head, placed by surviving victim Mason Verger. Clarice Starling (Moore) enters the fray to help capture Lecter.Almost everyone knows the story of how, the minute Silence of the Lambs became a smash-hit and quintuple Oscar-winner, a fat check landed on source author Richard Harris' desk, optioning a follow-up, and paying an unprecedented million-dollar-per-year fee until he produced said book. Well, after 9 years, the master of lean, tightly plotted thrillers turned in a bloated, 500+ page dark tragedy, full of answers to questions none of us had asked, and afflicted with one of the worst and most non-sensical endings in recent times. Though the long-awaited book flew off the shelves, everyone wondered how this would possibly translate to the big screen, especially given mixed word of mouth and early refusal from 3 of Lambs' Oscar-winners to be involved at all.Superproducer DIno De Laurentis, having been outfoxed on a deal for Lambs, paid top dollar for future rights to Harris' books and characters, and would not be discouraged. With Demme, Foster and screenwriter Ted Tally out of the loop, he brought in Ridley Scott (fresh off Gladiator), Julianne Moore and the odd but impressive writing combination of Steven Zallian (Schindler's List, Clear and Present Danger) and David Mamet. The later two went to town on the bloated manuscript, particularly its ending.So what did all these advance payments buy? The result is predictably dark, Gothic and often beautiful to behold. It is also frequently silly and many story elements do not work. In short, it is a quintessential modern Ridley Scott film, which, given his status as a hired hand here, might seem surprising, and is perhaps a bit unfair. His guidance on the story development indeed represents an objective and significant improvement over the book, and it is easy to see the potential he saw: the atmosphere is almost perfect, and some of the weirder moments are played with a darkly funny, malicious sense of humor. Of course, it is no Silence of the Lambs...The mystery is gone, partly undone by having so much focus on Hannibal himself. Hopkins seems to also have lost the character somewhat, playing him as a charming devil rather than a machine in a man's body, the passionless monster that bewitched us in Silence. Moore also struggles with Foster's legacy, yet when she is allowed to explore new ground, she makes quite an impression. Likewise, the best parts of the film are those that explore unchartered territory, such as Giancarlo Giannini's doomed Inspector Pazzi or an uncredited turn from Gary Oldman as the grotesque Mason Verger. And, somewhere in the background, Hans Zimmer uses a simple window-dressing opportunity to compose an aria that ranks among the finest work of his career.This is not for everyone, and is bound to disappoint anyone familiar with its predecessor. But it has a few solid merits and its mood does set base rules for the superior television show. So if you have a solid stomach and like your fun dark and violent, check it out. For all my misgivings and gripes I did enjoy this film quite a bit in the end... maybe it just made me hungry.",Hannibal
158,x_manicure_x,Pointless film,5,14 August 2021,"I remember watching ""Hannibal"" with my family on TV shortly after its release and fleeing to my room in less than ten minutes, absolutely unable to stand the view of Mason Verger and the whole atmosphere that surrounded him (the fun part is that I tried to exorcise my fear by playing Silent Hill 2 the entire time, and I am not sure it was of any help). My parents came to check on me a couple of times throughout the film, telling me how boring it was and that there was literally nothing to be afraid of, but I couldn't believe them. I grew up scared of watching the film again, but could finally find the strength to check it out some time ago. Needless to say, I am glad I decided to invest my time in something else back then.It's not a terrible film: Ridley Scott is a good director able to create charming atmospheres in his works, but there is literally nothing remotely interesting here. The plot is too fragmented and so full of worthless sequences and dialogues. Aware of the fact that making something along the lines of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" would have resulted in backlash from critics, Scott tries a moodier and more exuberant approach, the gore is a bit cartoony but at least offers some interesting moments to wake us up after hours of pure boredom. The last moments in Florence and the dinner at the lake house with Clarice are perhaps the only two scenes worth watching. As they couldn't get Jodie Foster to play Clarice Sterling, the whole film completely focuses on Hannibal Lecter's figure, and even tries to picture him as a wicked but charmingly rational and coherent antihero: his victims are the corrupted cop, the greedy detective, the child rapist, in a way they are the real monsters who deserved punishment. Some time is spent on the ambiguous relationship between Lecter and a more badass version of Clarice (played by Julianne Moore), but like the rest of the film, we end up going round and round without getting anywhere.",Hannibal
159,Quicksand,The Lambs stopped screaming. I started.,4,17 February 2001,"As its own movie, ""Hannibal"" is uninteresting, confusing and without any brain whatsoever.  As a sequel to a film that won 5 Academy Awards in 1991, it is slightly interesting, a bit confusing, but still without any brain whatsoever.Hopkins gives an excellent performance.  With the exception of the repeated ""okey dokey,"" his voice, facial expressions, and overall characterizations are incredible to watch.  The cinematography is also excellent, photographed by John Mathieson, Oscar nominated for Scott's ""Gladiator.""Everything else about this movie is a dud.  Julianne Moore, whom I love and respect, plays Clarice like an overconfident 15-year old.  Ray Liotta's character exists only to snarl at Clarice, which he seems to do for no other reason than because she's female.  I understand that in today's society, some men will still not accept a woman in a place of authority, but Liotta's character treats this woman with such disrespect I find it impossible to understand how he could have even graduated high school let alone rise to such an FBI ranking.  The filmmakers are apparently too stupid to know how to make an audience hate a character unless they make him a one-note bigot.Or, conversely, they didn't aspire to do anything other than make a fast buck.  David Mamet and Steve Zaillan are extremely talented and award-winning writers, my only guess is that the source material was written for a quick buck, as Thomas Harris was out of ideas.  Every time someone dies in this movie, the movie itself starts to get worse.  The ending is contrived and makes no sense.  The last line is either smarter than, or dumber than, the entire movie that precedes it-- and that depends on if there's a sequel, which I have no interest in seeing.Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling was young and inexperienced, and we rooted for her to outsmart this psychotic killer, which she never did.  Moore's Starling is old enough to know better, but doesn't.  Why anyone would tolerate her, or any other character in this movie, is beyond me.  This is a Hollywood formula from start to finish, an overdone slasher film whose only likable character turns out to be Hannibal himself.  I feel dumber for having watched it.4/10",Hannibal

For one I missed Jodie Foster very much she is just such a wonderful actress. The script is a drop-off from The, Silence of the Lambs sure Anthony Hopkins once again gives a fine performance as the man who feels no guilt (Dr. Hannibal Lecter) but the missing ingredients are the realism and study into the mind of a serial killer.

162,Alanjackd,Love it or hate it,7,23 October 2017,"Firstly..I think Lecter is the champion of all screen baddies...somebody who would eat your living flesh is, for me, the ultimate horror.Secondly...don't think of it as a sequel and hold it against SOTL, because that was all about Starling...this is about Lecter...so it's not a sequel...just an opening of a bit part from the 1st movie. While the 1st movie dealt with the horror and misgivings of the bad guy...this dealt with the horror and misgivings of the good guys...and pointed out there's not much difference in them both.Beautifully acted and very well directed...this delves more into the wheres and not the whys...some of the dialogue is fantastic while dealing with sexism and office bullying.For me, Tony Hopkins dominated the 1st movie without hardly being in it....and he does the same again with a lead role. I also think in both movies the women are very strong characters..and that adds to the realism about Lecters lack of his mother in his life...if that makes sense. The violence is almost invisible , which makes me wonder why it was an 18 cert in the U.K..Excellent storytelling with excellent performances all round. I look at the average score and I notice very lows and very highs...as I said in my summary...you either love it or hate it...I loved it and will watch and watch again.",Hannibal
163,barberoux,Caricature.,6,27 August 2001,"The problem with sequels is the original players are not offered any more character development.  They have become icons, or symbols of people, and are drawn in broad brush strokes of caricature.  Did we learn anything more about Clarice or Hannibal? Absolutely not.  They acted as predicted surrounded with the known atmosphere introduced in the first movie.  The movie was stylishly photographed but the scenes lacked any depth and when examined they fall apart.  Are we to really believe Clarice falls asleep in a chair and Hannibal happens to sneak in just then and romps around the room without her awakening.  Don't you think Clarice would be a tad more alert given her circumstances and training.  Does it make sense for a women with Clarice's background, rather rural, and for someone who jogs regularly to stay in shape to be slurping whiskey in the middle of the afternoon. Anthony Hopkins was good as Hannibal given the paucity of script.  Couldn't they have found some other piece of music besides the Goldberg Variations as his leit motif, again just a copy from the first movie, no original thought used.  Julianne Moore, a good actress, lacked Jodie Foster's intensity or grit.  She was not convincing as Clarice.  Gary Oldman, as usual, was good since his character had to be more, should I say it, fleshed out.",Hannibal

Moore does an excellent job as Starling, despite a lesser role for the first half, although probably not to Foster's standard, yet that may just be because her predecessor was in the superior film. But really, it's all about Hopkins, who is fantastic as Hannibal Lecter again. So disconcerting yet engaging and intriguing.It takes a little while for the plot to pick up pace, and at first it can be somewhat confusing picking up how Verger comes into play with the backstory. However, towards the end you'll find your whole body tense up in apprehension, yet you'll be kept guessing. An incredible story, justifiably delivered.",Hannibal

Paul Krendler played by Ray Liotta is assigned to work with Starling because Starling Has been assigned to work with Mason Verger played by Gary Oldman who was a patient of Dr. Hannibal Lecter played by Anthony Hopkins and is the only one who survived and has to live the rest of his life with a disfigured face as he wants to exact revenge on Hannibal Lecter.A little while later Inspector Rinalldo Pazzi played by Giancarlo Giannini wants to bring Hannibal Lecter to the police to collect a reward for $3,000,000. However Hannibal Kidnapps him and kills him before Pazzi Can collect the reward money.The climax of the film takes place at Mason's Mansion as mason wants to feed Hannibal to his wild boars. As Starling kills all of his men Mason is thrown to the wild boars and dies. Hannibal takes care of Starling as Starling has been shot. He drugs her and Krendler as they sit down to have dinner. Hannibal then cuts the top half of Krendlers skull off as he cuts off a part of his brain and serves it to Krendler. Starling handcuffs herself to Lecter as Lecter grabs a meat cleaver, Cuts his hand off and escapes on a plane.This film is great. It has wonderful pacing and a good story. This film also has standout performances by Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter Ray Liotta as Paul Krendler and Gary Oldman as Mason Verger. But there is one thing about the film that bugs me and that is Juliane Moore as Clarice Starling. The way she interprets this character is negative, dull and a little mean spirited whereas Jodie Foster did a much better Job coming off as more Charismatic and More of a happy spirit back in The Silence Of The Lambs.

166,MogwaiMovieReviews,Always Important To Try New Things,9,22 August 2021,"While of course not in the same realm of perfection as Silence of the Lambs - one of the 10 greatest thrillers ever made - the first sequel, ten years later, is still a fantastic piece of thrilling, if far-fetched, entertainment. Anthony Hopkins does a great job of maintaining and building upon the iconic character he created in the first film, and Julianne Moore does a decent enough job of making us forget about Jodie Foster. Many of the smaller parts, such as Giancarlo Giannini, Zeljko Ivanek and Frankie Faison, returning as prison guard Barney, are note-perfect, although Ray Liotta is probably a little too over-the-top in his sliminess.Best of them all is an absolutely unrecognizable (and uncredited) Gary Oldman as Lecter's hideously disfigured nemesis, the only one of his victims to have survived, now living a life of impossible wealth devoted only to vengeance. It's one of a great actor's very greatest performances, creating a terrifying and truly unforgettable character almost entirely from the occasional flicker of an eyelid and a nails-down-chalkboard drawl.I remember thinking when I first saw the movie how the only other figure in popular culture Hannibal Lecter reminded me of was Sherlock Holmes: obviously on opposite sides of the moral coin, but they are the only fully-fleshed-out characters I can think of who can be in control of everything going in a room while still tied to a chair. Their fascination to the audience comes entirely from their mind, which admittedly here is inflated some way beyond the human, but probably not much more than many of the depictions of Holmes' deductive abilities in movies about him over the years.The changes made to the story from the book are all pretty good: the novel is a good pageturner but overlong, and the ending, in which Starling and Lecter end up together romantically, is preposterously unbelievable, so changing it to what we have here (""this is really gonna hurt"") improves it massively, and adds real weight and sacrifice to their relationship.A lot was said when it came out about how absurd it is that Lecter, #1 on the FBI's most wanted list, is able to travel around the world with no disguises, and no-one batting an eyelid. This IS undeniably very silly, and the biggest weakness in the film, but if you are prepared to suspend a little of your disbelief in matters like this and go along with the fantasy, you will find Hannibal to be an enormously enjoyable and emotionally satisfying thriller leaps and bounds above most other things in its class.8½",Hannibal

The Silence of the Lambs was terrific at creating psychological terror.  Hannibal is much more interesting, because instead of a thriller the film is a grotesque love story.  The audience gets to be in Hannibal's head a little bit and see all the sick little things that make Hannibal the cannibal.The film is visually striking thanks to director Ridley Scott.

Anyway...this is really not a bad movie. The scenes with Frankie R. Faison (Dectective Patzzi) are great. The scenes with Anthony Hopkins (Doctor Lecter) are great. The scenes with both of them are...high class. On the other hand....Ray Liotta is a very un--convincing ""bad guy"". Gary Oldman (Mason Virger) makes the Elephant Man look like a cuddly toy. He is a little cut up. The scenes in Florence (with Hopkins and Faison) are way above the rest of the movie.

Sometimes that's not so good, since I miss if the leading character would suddenly get killed to bring chock to the movie. Since I then go ""Well, I'm prepared for anything, I don't really have any expectations on this movie"". This, of course, also goes with sequels that ""has to live up to the old films"". First of all, that is a bad thing to say. A sequel, in my opinion, does best when it stays, maybe not far away, but at least on a bit of a distance, so that it don't repeat itself. So, seeing it out of that perspective, ""Hannibal"" is a fine sequel. It doesn't repeat itself, which would be having Clarice Starling searching another killer with Lecter as a guide. Instead the movie rather brilliantly focuses on Hannibal Lecter, giving it a touch of his class (not the original movie's ""dirtyness"") and way of life - giving an amount of distance to the fist film. However it doesn't ignore it, Barney the nurse (or whatever he is) and the tapes with the conversations keeps us in mind that this is a sequel. That is how a really good sequel is made. So it's a great sequel. But it's a not-so-great movie.I think Ridley Scott is misplaced. Or, honestly, I wouldn't have thought so, but since I've seen the movie now I say this. When I first heard of this film, I figured Scott to be a great director to make this sequel. But I guess he didn't like doing the movie, because its really empty. The acting is the best thing about the movie. Moore is OK as Starling, since this movie is so different from the original you never really miss Foster, Hopkins is great as usual - but Lecter has gone sick! His freedom must have given him a touch of the classic lack-of-ideas-psychopath-syndrome. The rather imaginative Dr.Lecter has started to, dull enough, killing people instead of eating them (he never takes a bite in this movie) and he has started to give jokes as never before. His humor is replaced by very Hollywood-ish jokes, to be honest; this ain't the same Lecter.I was almost fooled by ""Hannibal"", because it looks really classy and non-hollywood-ish but I started thinking. I sat down and saw the movie again, and found my suspicions were true. It looks classy, it does, and it also looks like it has a great mix of gore and intellect, but it's just empty. When it's not a repellent fascination of hypergore, it's long and boring, and the same goes for the dialogues. I'd really like to think ""Hannibal"" as a great film, but it is still just an empty movie, disguised in a classy shell and some good performances. 5/10",Hannibal
174,The_Core,Ebert... When did he lose it...,9,19 February 2001,"Ya know, I used to respect Roger Ebert's reviews... right up until I realized he gave ""Blair Witch Project"" (without a doubt the dumbest film ever released in theaters) four stars, while criticizing ""Blade Runner"" for lack of character development!  Have you ever noticed that films which offend his sensibilities he refers to as ""geek films?""  I'm guessing he was probably called a ""geek"" all the way through high school and probably well into college...Anyway, I finally realized that Roger Ebert is socially retarded and psychologically infantile.  Since he's rich monetarily and probably has many of the same 'sensibilities' as the ""Hannibal Lecter"" character, I can see how he would be offended by this film (poor, poor guy...).  Send me some money, Roger.PLEASE watch ""Hannibal"" as a stand-alone movie, and don't think of it as a sequel to ""Silence of the Lambs.""  It is NOT A SEQUEL to that movie, but a film with some of the same characters (and many different ones).  Talk is cheap, and I would really like to read several reviews from people who never saw SOTL (is there anyone out there?  Hello?).Needless to say, I really DID go into ""Hannibal"" with no particular expectations (other than knowing Ridley Scott directed it, so I was expecting great atmosphere and visuals) and the film delivered!  I've never been a big fan of the series (SOTL was OK but I wasn't that impressed), and I've never read any of the books.  This movie was just fantastic.  It does take its time getting where it goes, but is the fun in the journey, or the goal?  To me, the fun is all in the journey, and so I really enjoyed this film.  Who cares about the climax, the fun is in how the movie gets there.At this time I've seen ""Hannibal"" twice, and I do admit enjoying it more the first time... but a second viewing clarified some plot points, and I just relaxed and enjoyed the film's eerie, languid, twistedly-peaceful atmosphere and Hopkins' incredible acting.

Hopkins fully develops the Lecter character to such a wonderful degree that you actually end up feeling sympathy and a sort of twisted affection for him!Julianne Moore was the weak point.  She gave it a good shot but couldn't measure up to Jodie Foster's performance.  She didn't convince as a hard-as-nails FBI agent.Ridley Scott's directing... this was absolutely his best since Blade Runner. Incredible use of camera combined with mixed slow/fast-action shots and gothic camera angles was absolutely mind blowing, and created a deliciously chilling atmosphere.My two major complaints:(1) Gary Oldman's makeup.  It wasn't bad, but it looked to me like a rubber mask.  This would be acceptable in the 1980's, but you would think makeup design could do better than this.  It looked like make-up, not real.(2) The end contains some gore that I thought was gratuitious.  It didn't go to further the plot, and it rather turned my stomach (especially the last one minute of the film).  I think some critics will react against the ending and ignore the rest of the film, and that's a shame.All in all, this movie was very much to my taste (pun intended) -- but be warned, this is twisted stuff (much moreso than Silence of the Lambs).

It is more bloody and gory but also it has Hannibal on screen more and that is a good thing.The basic plot involves Hannibal Lector. He is living in another country and the only person to survive an attack from him, Mason Verger, wants to capture him and kill him. Clarice Starling, not played by Jodie Foster but instead by Julianne Moore, gets involved as well.I like this film a lot because you get to see more of Hannibal. Anthony Hopkins is great as him once again, I think he was better in Silence of the Lambs though. Lector does a lot of killing, and conversing. He truly is as gifted a speaker as he is a killer.Julianne Moore plays Clarice Starling in this film rather than Jodie Foster. I strongly prefer Foster, and Moore to me just did not do it for me. So that character I feel was much better in The Silence of the Lambs.This Film has a lot more gore in it than Silence did. Some of it gets quite graphic and this film may disturb some viewers. But the whole film is not a gore fest, just towards the last half an hour or so.The story is pretty good and somewhat easy to understand.

Numerous rewrites, Jodie Foster turning the role down, Jonathan Demme not wanting in, etc. Somehow, somewhere I had hoped for the best, being as enamored by the good doctor that I am, and plunked the money down.First, the tumultuous lack of chemistry between Julianne Moore and Anthony Hopkins, didn't help. They acted like they were some old couple that got on each others nerves frequently. Second, the script jostled from one direction to the other, and it showed, badly. The predictability ratio was also too high, basically numbing the screenplay down to the IQ of a poptart. Instead of slick, well-infused, suspenseful dialogue, a lot of gross-out graphics were thrown in to compensate. Worst of all, is the character Hannibal Lecter, himself. The script, and the portrayal itself, was presented as cartoonish and a mocking self-parody. Very different from the Dr. Lecter that scared the daylights out of us, years ago. Now, he's just a whacko, sans style and wit. Frankly, it came off like just another slasher flick.

Thomas Harris is a writer who goes to great lengths to do background research for the books he writes, and as a result he only does so once every 6-8 years (compare that to well-known crime writers who kick out a volume every year). When rushed, like he was because of the raving success of Silence Of The Lambs, the results are predictably unfinished. The movie is based on the book, but doesn't have the time to go to the same lengths in building a back story, and as a result for anyone who has read it, it feels rushed. And of course, the ending is very different and feels like a copout. What didn't help was getting a cold fish of a directory like Ridley Scott (Alien, Blade Runner) to do this movie which is basically set in beautiful Italy. What I would like to have more of, is the back story to Hannibal Lecter, his aristocratic background and his youth in the Axis occupied Baltic. Now there would be a fascinating tale, a love story between Hannibal and Clarice. Instead, the movie is simply rushing through the main events of the book, without using the most interesting ones. Mason Verger's sister, easily the most interesting gargoyle of a character after Mason himself, has been completely written out of the movie, as has as was Ardelia Mapp. Having said all that, this is still a very significant movie. It's a must see for fans of Manhunter and Silence Of the Lambs, Harris' other two movies/books, and it's still riveting to watch Hannibal at work. But without working in the crucifiction scene from the book and Hannibal's counsel to Verger's sister, the movie lost a lot. But those are criticisms of what the movie could have been. Still, if you're renting, you could do worse.",Hannibal
180,HelloTexas11,best of the series,9,26 November 2007,"I love all of the first three 'Hannibal' films. They're all part of the same world, they all tell wonderfully creepy stories, and yet each one is very different from the others. I think this is because each director has his own take on the books of Thomas Harris, but they all respect the material and stay true to its unique character, and the character of Hannibal Lecter himself. This film, the second in the series, has been undeservedly brushed off and belittled as hopelessly inferior to the first. Granted, 'Silence of the Lambs' is a great movie and a hard act to follow; 'Hannibal,' though, is a rich, beautifully photographed film that I think surpasses the initial entry in many ways. Director Ridley Scott seems to instinctively understand what is called for, and he uses all his considerable directorial skills to bring the Harris book successfully to the screen. The shoot-out at the fish market which opens the film is a superior action scene, a stylistic tour de force which re-introduces us to Clarice Starling (now played by Julianne Moore). Scott especially relishes the scenes in Florence and at times the atmosphere, the operatic music, and again the gorgeous photography make you feel as if you're watching Italian cinema. The illusion is furthered by Giancarlo Gianinni, who is cast to perfection as the Italian police inspector Pazzi. He has a superbly expressive face, sad eyes and a fascinating air of world-weariness. He sounds like he's speaking Italian even though it's English. Mason Verger (an unrecognizable Gary Oldman) is a disfigured victim of Lecter's who now seeks a particularly loathsome kind of revenge. Oldman has twisted fun with the horrific Verger; there are times when you want to cringe and laugh at the same time. In fact, that is one of 'Hannibal's' best qualities, the black humor that permeates the film and keeps it from becoming oppressively morbid. A throwaway line early in the film is typical- Starling tells an assistant she's received a letter from the Guinness Book congratulating her on being the female FBI agent to have shot and killed the most people. And of course at the center of all this is Anthony Hopkin's Hannibal. Both actor and character seem very much at home in the Florence setting, and the scenes between Hopkins and Gianinni are wonderful to watch. Eventually, Hannibal returns to America and is captured by Verger's men, or does he allow himself to be captured? One is never quite certain with Hannibal. Verger's plan backfires and he meets a gruesome end, which sets up the film's true climax and the scene which has earned it its greatest notoriety. Paul Krendler is a Justice Department lawyer and Starling's real nemesis in the film. Portrayed with sleazy venom by Ray Liotta, Krendler might best be described as the misogynist from hell. His only interest in Starling appears to be how he can get her in bed. He is also taking a large bribe from Verger to trap Lecter. When that plot fails, and Starling is rescued and sedated by Lecter, Krendler becomes a hostage to the doctor; there is then the unforgettable scene where the top of Krendler's head is removed and part of his brain stir-fried with shallots. Ever the gracious host, Lecter obligingly feeds some of it to Krendler himself. The actual ending of the film left many in the audience puzzled, as it seemed out-of-character for Hannibal (just as the ending in the book seemed uncharacteristic for Starling, to Jodie Foster at least) and for some, that is the film's fatal flaw. But it is more an epilogue than anything; it doesn't substantially detract from the mesmerizing masterpiece that has preceded it.",Hannibal
181,Mr_Censored,Overly complicated yet insanely intriguing.,6,19 November 2008,"The thing about ""Hannibal"" -- sequel to the Oscar winning ""Silence Of The Lambs -- is that it's a pretty tough movie to sit through. Tough, not because of it's graphic nature, but because of it's overall lack of focus. Ridley Scott's take on Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter can't decide if it's a horror, a romance, a cop-drama or a suspense-thriller. It's got a good balance of all of them, but jumps around far too much, carries too many sub-plots and never comes across with a clear sense of purpose. No statement to be made, just a well-made, well-acted, gorgeous looking film that leaves the viewer, after over two and a half hours spent, wanting more.Anthony Hopkins returns to his signature role, and is spot-on. No fault can be found in his performance here, and you will find that he actually plays the character down a bit compared to the sometimes flamboyant, over-the-top performance he gave ten years prior. Julianne Moore replaces Jodie Foster as the resilient Clarice Starling, and although the script doesn't allow her character much dimension (no more than what was already established in ""Silence Of The Lambs, at least) she does a fine job replacing Foster as a character so ingrained in pop-culture that she was almost impossible to recast. Ray Liotta plays her smarmy boss with ease, while Gary Oldman, completely unrecognizable (especially given that he goes uncredited) plays a very disturbing, very hilarious and very disfigured victim of Hannibal's, offering a generous reward to anyone who can deliver the good doctor to him. The directing by Ridley Scott delivers plenty of atmosphere and memorable visuals, enough so to warrant repeated viewings. Also, the score, by Hans Zimmer, is especially classy and utterly breath-taking. It's the script -- based off of an already sketchy novel -- that the problems stem from. It seems to me, if one is to make a sequel to such a highly regarded piece as ""Silence Of The Lambs"" -- whether it be in book or movie form -- it should at least have a solid story that holds water. This does not. As mentioned before, the movie can't decide what it wants to be, and the story jumps around so much that by the third act, it's exhausted itself. There are plenty of good ideas in ""Hannibal"", it's just too bad no one could sort them into cohesion. Regardless, it's got good performances and brilliant direction, so despite the fact that it doesn't live up to it's predecessor, ""Hannibal"" is still worth a look.",Hannibal
182,Thats_some_scary_stuff_Reviews,A daily comment from Midget Emma: Hannibal (2001),6,25 April 2008,"Well its no Silence of the Lambs or Red Dragon but it was still satisfying. I already owned both 'Silence' and Red Dragon so it didn't feel right not having Hannibal.If you loved Silence of the Lambs then you are going to be missing a few things. Of course its missing Jodie Foster. It doesn't feel the same watching someone else hunting down Hannibal Lector. It is also missing that exciting suspense that we had in 'Silence'.This time around we get much more violence then the others. We get blood,guts and cannibalism. Not for weak stomaches.One thing i have to mention is that i loved the ending it was great.I recommend it if you have seen any of the Hannibal movies or have read the books.6/10",Hannibal
183,papanloveu,"Good, but not great!",6,27 October 2021,"It's good to see Hannibal out and about in society. His disfigured nemesis is one of the best on film, that makeup is next level and his acting is perfect. Having Moore play Starling throws me off a bit especially when Foster is still acting, but I believe it was Foster who made the call not to do it as she had her own passion project to do - which is stupid because she hadn't even started filming her film when Hannibal was released. Anyway, Moore did well. Some of the horror scenes are pretty intense with good performances all round. I love the very last scene on the plane with the curious little boy.",Hannibal
184,David_Frames,Okey Dokey!,6,2 September 2005,"Remember Silence of the Lambs? Of course you do, and with good reason because it was one of the best thrillers of the last twenty years - marvellous stuff, anchored in a very complete fashion by Anthony Hopkin's Hannibal Lecter. These days you have to fight off the revisionists that like to disown the film in favour of Manhunter - the latter being a cult, if dated offering that shows the superior intelligence of those who recognise its marginal pleasures. You see, if something is popular it, by definition, must be resisted because that means that people like you must enjoy it and its inconceivable that you possess the same nuanced critical faculty as the person you're talking to. Thus Manhunter is championed as the thinking man's cult favourite - Brian Cox being an anaemic Lecter is comparison to Hopkin's wry performance but why let the bleeding obvious taint a good story? I mention this only because the same distance that separates Hunter from Lambs, inversely applies to this sequel - perhaps the only movie in history that was informed by a novel that was only written under pressure from Film producers so they'd have something to adapt. Think about the implications of that for a moment. You've written a series of successful thrillers, one of which has been adapted into a multi-Oscar winning movie loved the world over. The book has no sequel and so inevitably you find yourself bombarded by requests to write one. No-one is interested in the book in its own right you understand, its just a template to be translated to celluloid. Someone would write an original script except they have no idea what to do and you wouldn't let them anyway because your anxious to protect your own intellectual property and rake in the $10M advance you're bound to get as soon as you've signalled the intention to whip your typewriter out. The irony of all this, for those of you still reading, is the novel in question was a dud and has an ending so poor (Starling and Lecter fall in love, ahhhhh) that millions have staged Nazi bonfire parties just to offload their copy. The movie producer, in this case Dino De Laurentis, who spent a gazillion dollars on the rights before a word was written is saddled with it and whereas common sense would dictate that your forget the book and devise your own version of what happened next, the deal is done so its up to Hollywood's best (Mamet/Zallian) to refashion this not so hot property into a film becoming of its predecessor. Hannibal's problem is that it attempts to circumvent its wretched source material with glossy direction from Ridley Scott but no helmsman or scriptwriter on earth can liberate anything approaching tension or excitement from the turgid, confused plot. Hopkins, reprising his iconic role, doesn't seem to remember quite how to do it. Stripped of his confinement, Lecter is a much reduced character - a parody of his former self - sounds a bit like him, looks like him but the menace is all gone, replaced by a sort of half-serious, half-kooky echo of the 1990 characterisation. Its not Hopkins fault per say, its just there's not the material there for him to, er, get his teeth into. Even worse is Julianne Moore, a urine-poor substitute for Jodie Foster - lacking the former actresses' intensity. It has its moments - I liked the Florence sequences, particularly Hannibal's ""I'm giving serious consideration....to eating your wife"" line but these are scant compensations for fans of the previous film. The talent is all there on screen but the source material kills this one at birth - in story terms, this looks as about as good as Mason Verger's face.",Hannibal
185,johnny-08,A whole new approach,6,4 July 2008,"""The Silence of the Lambs"" is and will always be one of the best thrillers ever made. To expect from its sequel to be equally brilliant is a bit unrealistic. Almost everything changed in this movie; the only thing that stayed is amazing Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter. Here, in very original title, ""Hannibal"" we've got new Agent Starling (I really like Julianne Moore but Foster was perfect in that role so no actress could replace her), new director, new places and a whole new approach to Dr.Lecter. In first movie, Lecter was mostly behind glass, here he's free to go around the world. He chooses Florence and I say who wouldn't? My favorite parts of this movie are all the ones in Italy where we have one of the greatest Italian actors Giancarlo Giannini in role of Insp.Pazzi. Giannini had the hardest job of the whole cast and he plays his role in a great way. List of familiar faces concludes with unrecognizable Gary Oldman as one of Lecter victims and Ray Liotta as dirty agent. I almost forgot beautiful Francesca Neri, unknown to American audience.Ridley Scott changed Demme on directing seat and I must say that that wasn't a perfect solution. This movie gets lost in its length and in its characters who are not well made. There is really nothing to act for main actors and that is the biggest minus of this movie (when I remember long scenes of Lecter-Starling conversation in that institution). ""Hannibal"" turns on card of scare. It supposes to be scary Oldman's appearance, Hopkins cutting and killing; serving brains all around or pigs eating people. Well, to me, it wasn't. Solid acting of Hopkins, Moore and Giannini holds this movie from break up and great scenes in Italy just puts it above water. For something more I advise you to look first part again or third one with Norton & co.",Hannibal
186,datorsiers2,Not the best sequel out there.,7,8 December 2015,"""Hannibal"" had a really tough task to live up to the expectations of its prequel, as it always is, when the original movie is a huge movie classic, i am talking, of course, about ""The Silence of the Lambs"". Was it bad? No. Did it make a huge positive impact to the franchise? Not really. Don't get me wrong, it is not horrible, but there some major flaws and obvious inferiorities, when compared to the classic.As much as i hate to admit this, i didn't enjoy Hannibal Lecter nearly as much as when he was imprisoned and seemingly incapable of doing anything. His dominant demeanor in ""The Silence of the Lambs"" just made him look like a god, he was like an indestructible master of manipulation, here he doesn't lose his appearance completely, but he seems a lot more vulnerable and at some parts i just couldn't believe how easily it was for his rivals to trick him, it just isn't relatable to his character. This film used gore in excess, in my opinion, it wasn't as elegant as its prequel, using gore is not necessarily a bad thing to do, just Hannibal Lecter was portrayed differently before so it does not quite fit. The film had many movie making flaws and illogical actions, that were quite annoying and obvious, but i would like to put that aside, because it was more important to see how the things unfold rather than pointing out the flaws. A huge upset is Jodie Foster not returning to play Clarice, not that Julianne Moore was horrible, it just is not the same, Foster was just loved and praised for her role in ""The Silence of the Lambs"", so that's a slight downgrade. Anthony Hopkins himself was great as Hannibal Lecter, even though as i mentioned above, i didn't enjoy Hannibal Lecter's character here as much as i did before, i still think Hopkins was outstanding in this movie.Unfortunately, this is another case when the sequel of a classic blockbuster movie doesn't come close to its original. I can guarantee you if there never was ""The Silence of the Lambs"", just ""Hannibal"" this movie would have a much higher rating than 6.7, at least 7.5. I admit it is a huge concern for me as well and i base my judgement highly on whether the second installment out shined the first or not.",Hannibal
187,Tiger_Mark,Horrible Movie based on a Horrible book!,1,15 July 2002,"Please, save your money or go rent ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Manhunter."" This was a tragically weak film based on a horrendous book. To say that some of the things in this movie bend the realm of reality is a huge understatement. The real disaster in this film, is letting Hopkins' character run wild w/out purpose. In the first two movies, Hannibal was more of a minor player that you anticipated seeing more often. In this film, you grow tired of seeing a cartoon version of his original character. I don't know if it was fair to attack Riddly Scott for this film, because he did get the weakest of the books to do, but I will attack him anyways. I believe Scott is one of the most simplistic film makers working today. His movies all tend to be aimed at a 7th grade mentality. This movie is hollow, without any soul and a complete waste of time.",Hannibal
188,MF210,I thought it was underrated,8,8 September 2003,"My Rating: *** out of ****. I am one of those people that thought Hannibal was unworthy of some of its harsh reviews. Although I believe the movie to be flawed, I thought it was good. It does lack some things Silence had, but I was never that crazy about Silence anyway. The acting in Hannibal is good. Julianne Moore is fine, she did have some huge shoes to fill and i do think it was hard for her to try to atleast be in the same range Jodie accomplished with the character. Anthony Hopkins returns and does a great job. Gary Oldman is very good as the creepy and disgusting Mason Verger. Ray Liotta is also good. I will admit the ending is disgusting beyond all belief but with the exception of the ending I liked this movie. The Cinematography was beautiful in Italy and the scenes in Italy had a certain dark atmosphere that I admired. The Script does not match Silence's but it is a decent script. Hannibal is obviously not for everyone but fans of the book and Hannibal Lecter should give it a try.",Hannibal
189,MF210,A flawed but absorbing thriller,8,22 August 2004,"My Rating: *** out of ****. Since it was released in theaters, Hannibal really hasn't been looked at favorably. It opened to mixed reviews from critics and much less audience approval. Well that was bound to happen since it was the follow up to the modern classic, Silence of the Lambs. Regardless of popular opinion, I liked Hannibal. Yes, it's a small step below the slightly overrated Silence of the Lambs but it stands as a solid thriller. It has its flaws and there are areas in which it is vastly inferior to Silence but Hannibal stands effectively on its own.
Hannibal can be seen as the ""dark and tragic romantic tale"" that director Ridley Scott sees it as. I did sense a connection in Silence between the two characters and that connection was even more present here. But the romance can never happen since it's not a mutual thing. Clarice doesn't want anything to do with Lecter, but it's ironic in a way, because he understands her better than any other character in the film. The ending in a way shows what he would sacrifice for her.Ridley Scott films are always notable for their visuals and Hannibal is no exception. Scott and Cinematographer John Mathieson have crafted a strikingly beautiful film. Hannibal is drenced with a dark atmosphere in nearly every frame. Also, the shots around Florence and North Carolina(Verger's Mansion) are gorgeous-looking. The style and Ridley Scott's direction remain the biggest strengths in the film. They keep the weakest parts of Hannibal interesting. The weakest part of the film is an Italian detective named Pazzi's pursuit of Lecter. The problem here is that Pazzi really isn't an interesting character. He's a paper-thin character and the performance of Giancarlo Giannini is pretty uninspired. Anthony Hopkins returns to arguably his greatest role ever. Once again he proves why he really is that great. His performance here is almost as brilliant as the one in Silence. Hannibal is still a creepy individual but he's a little more likable here. Hopkins should be given a lot of credit for making this happen. Seeing Anthony Hopkins in his role makes it a little odd not seeing Jodie Foster in the role of Clarice Starling. No matter though. Julianne Moore is an effective replacement. Ten Years after the events in Silence, Clarice is more stressed out by her job. You can sense how tired she is in the movie. While Moore's performance isn't nearly as brilliant as Foster's was, she does a respectable job nonetheless. There are a couple of meritable supporting performances. Gary Oldman gives an inspired performance as a man who wants to get revenge on Hannibal Lecter. There's a lot of make-up for the role (I had no clue it was him) but its Oldman's acting that allows him to disappear into the character. Ray Liotta is always good at playing unpleasant individuals so theres no surprise that he plays the part like an expert. The most controversial scene in Hannibal is easily the ending. Most hate it and a lot of people think it ruined the film. I am conflicted about it myself. In a way, its a memorable ending (how could that not be memorable in some way) but it feels a little awkward. It's gross but it's also unique. I don't really know what it is, I am not even sure if it damages the film in anyway. Like I said, Hannibal does have its flaws but it's an absorbing film. There were moments in the film where I was so riveted that I thought about rewarding the film a ***1/2. However, Hannibal fell just a little short but that doesn't change the fact that Hannibal is an entertaining, thrilling film.",Hannibal

Anyway, having seen Ridley Scott and crew working on location (a shot was made before my own store - but didn't make the cut to the edited version), I am in awe of the man for the attention to details he put in every scene, but this movie is not good as it should be, even with a story so terribly bad like the one that mr.Harris has written.

Still, I feel this movie has a lot to offer, in terms of action and also character. After all, we get to see Hannibal as the main villain and out in the open. Julianne Moore is not Jodie Foster, but none the less did a good job. Gary Oldman did a fantastic turn as a former patient of Hannibal's whose now hunting him for revenge, proving once more that he's one of the most underrated actors in the history of cinema. Rounding out the cast is Ray Liotta, who I think did a great job despite what others have said as an arrogant FBI official.

That should be enough for you to skip this stinker by itself, but when you add in a horrible Ray Liotta and a climax that involves watching him stutter through his lines with his brain hanging out, it becomes a certifiable national disaster.

194,budmassey,"A worthy, if not equal, sequel.",8,28 April 2001,"It's hard to speak of this film and not mention its shortcomings. Julianne Moore is a television movie of the week version of Clarice Starling compared to the remarkably nuanced and layered performance of Academy Award winning Jodie Foster.  Mason was much scarier in the book, although Gary Oldman is stunning in the pared down role.  There's a lot missing, including a delicious subplot involving Mason's lesbian sister.  And Ray Liotta should just get a new agent.But then, there is Sir Anthony Hopkins. He moves effortlessly like a spider through webs of his own making, as well as those of his enemies.  Hopkins, who even composed the music he plays in a scene at Hannibal's  Venice apartment, delivers a tour de force performance that almost, almost, lives up to the anticipation we have all felt for a decade waiting for Hannibal to return.And, of course, there is Ridley Scott, who infuses every scene with cinematic magic.  Oh, I suppose I could have done without the pigeon scene in the beginning, but it was a hoot.  It also foreshadowed the delightful way that Sir Anthony squeezed a devilish humor out of so dark a role.Living in North Carolina, I had to yell ""Foul"" when Mason Verger's home turned out to be the well-known Biltmore Estate in Asheville, but I guess they had to film it somewhere.

Clarissa Starling has been hung out to dry by her superiors for a drug raid that got violent. A raid, that she disapproved of, where 4 violent criminals were killed off, one of them being a black woman crime lordess who had her baby when she was shot dead, while she was shooting at Clarissa. Never mind, the baby was unharmed and the raid was executed without her approval and against her orders. It was compared to Waco by the news and her superiors, why? Were 80 odd cultists burned alive after a long siege? And this in a Mamet, no Zallian screenplay. One of her bureaucratic tormentors, played by Ray Liotta, is a future victim too. In ten years since her debut, she has learned to be really rude and nasty, especially to her coworkers and superiors, no more nice little small town girl.Hannibal, after the ""Silence of the Lamb"", has escaped to Italy where he is living the artsy fartsy good life doing some sort of appraisal work. He is being tracked down by a Mason Verger, a degenerate, crippled, disfigured ex child molester who is super rich. You see, Verger was Hannibal's only victim who lived and he is so super rich, he has a palatial Virginian estate and his own highway to it.The story shifts gears and goes over Italy for more artsy cannibalism and gore. Needless to say, Hannibal increased his body edible count. Of course, all his victims have some sort of defect of character, far less than Hannibal though. So we are supposed to identify with Hannibal like Clarissa does again. She helps rescue him from some justified vengeance and get even more people killed, including Verger. But ex-child molesters are more heinous than cannibals in this world. This is because they have bonded in some Platonic love and ampathy so that Hannibal sacrifices part of himself to spare her, after doing in her bureaucratic tormentor in a real medically sadistic scene.There is nothing enlightening or satisfying in this installment. I compare this to ""Natural Born Killers"" in its glorification of charismatic but utterly depraved killers. At least NBK was so over the top it was hard to take seriously, as this film aimed at. I mean, with Mamet doing the screenplay and Sir Ridley Scott directing, plus a huge budget, what are we supposed to make of this? Are we, the public and audience, so depraved that we should invoke sympathy for a depraved killer cause his victims are less than innocent and he has intelligence and a taste in Renaissance art?

I was disappointed, as I think everyone was, that Ms. Foster did not agree to reprise her role as Clarice Starling, but Julianne Moore does an excellent job. Frankie Faison is consistent in his role as Barney, the kindly nurse who placed the chair opposite Lecter's cell in the first film, and in this one he is caught by Clarice auctioning off the remainders of Lecter's belongings. Most of the action is around Lecter and his intricate game of chess with Verger, played exceptionally by Gary Oldman, but the three subplots are brought together in the end, and an unexpected end at that. Ridley Scott, the director of such Sci Fi classics as Blade Runner and Alien, does not disappoint, and this film retains all the darkness and foreboding of the former.

The return of this iconic and creepy 1990's character really gives me the shivers every time I think of the final dinner sequence (tip: approach this with an empty stomach), or whenever I dwell into the twisted relationship between the two lead characters.If anything, this feature is more of a character study that dives into the sick souls of two individuals gone wrong than anything else. Watch this one with caution, and with an open mind; but beware: Mostly like the original Academy Award winning The Silence of the Lambs, the violence in this movie is very graphic, and not for the fainted hearted.

The worrying thing is that some people, on this list, thought this film was great, one of the best films ever made.How is that possible.  It's not the worst film in the world, but lets be honest, it's very poor.  How can you ignore the absolutely ridiculous plot; Italian's speaking perfect fluent English, even at home, the non-existent Italian Police force.  Why did Mason seek revenge, when his wounds were inflicted on himself.  why would Hannibal even visit this man anyway.  Why did the FBI show next to no interest in capturing Hannibal.
Knowing the link between Lecter and Clarice, the FBI would have guarded her house, they would have also watched the Airports.The beauty of the first film was how Lecter was very clever in getting what he wanted through intelligence and psychology.  In this, he is superman, he able to do what ever he wants in full view of camera's and public without anyone stopping him, move from country to country, place to place, without explanation with the grace and charm of Rambo.Ridley, as in Gladiator, produces some nice artistic film shots, accompanied by atmospheric music, but unfortunately to no end.  All the slow motions and beautiful camera work don't match what's happening in the non-existent story.I haven't read the book, but from what friends tell me, it is even worse than the film, so why make it into a movie.

Anthony Hopkins, Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman, Giancarlo Giannini, Ray Liotta, Frankie Faison, Francesca Neri, Hazelle Goodman, David Andrews. 10 years after the events of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins) is alive and at large, living in Florence, Italy. When FBI agent Clarice Starling (now played by Moore) is reassigned to the case, she and Lecter play cat-and-mouse games. Does not have the style or thrills of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and is simply just a black comedy. To be fair to Moore (who has the thankless job of replacing Jodie Foster as Starling) she delivers a good performance, but then again she ISN'T the same character we knew in 1991. The film is also overly gory and the ending, although true to the book, is disgusting. RATING: 6 out of 10. Rated R for graphic violence and torture, grisly images, strong language, and nudity.",Hannibal
200,C22Man,Flawed? Yes. Disturbed? Of Course. Ambitious? Definitely,5,3 July 2016,"Hannibal takes the rules set up by its predecessor and throws them out the window. It trades in the focus and grittiness for something far more depraved and disturbing. The stylistic change sees the film evolve from a harsh cop thriller to a wildly imaginative horror spectacle. It clearly acknowledges what worked so well with the massively successful 'The Silence of the Lambs', yet it twists and turns into something else completely. It becomes something interesting, a sequel to a mega-hit that openly decides to be something entirely different.The film starts roughly ten years after Clarice's first encounter with Lecter. She is disgraced after a drugs bust goes horribly wrong. A lifeline is offered to her in the form of finding Lecter, who is now in Florence masquerading as an art curator and being tracked by Italian detective Pazzi (well-played by the melancholic looking Giancarlo Giannini). The Clarice here is vastly different and not just in terms of actress. She's much wearier and more cynical, no longer an ambitious inquisitive detective. Julianne Moore suffers from, if anything, playing it too safe. She doesn't copy Foster, yet she doesn't add her own touches. She just plays it blandly straight and serious. Of course this isn't Starling's film, but all the same she shouldn't become a dreary addition.We soon learn that Lecter is being hunted down by the wealthy but disfigured and paralysed child molester Mason Verger, determined to get revenge after falling victim to Lecter and cutting his own face off. Verger himself is played with a calculated cunning and subtle creepiness by an unrecognisable Gary Oldman. Characters like him are naturally interesting. He has so little control over own body yet he able to amass a group of men whose purpose is to find Lecter and bring him to his mansion, so that he can be fed to a group of flesh- eating boars. It's an extravagant plan, but Verger works as a diabolical villain and his crazy plan fits the films tone in the grand scheme of things. It just about works because it's that type of film.It's no shock that Lecter is the star and Anthony Hopkins delivers a fine performance in the role that won him an Oscar previously. He keeps it hammy, but he does well to get across that this is an older and more devious Lecter. He slips out of tough situations, tricks people, even managing to ensnare Clarice's conscience, there are layers added to the character which is what any sequel should do. There are some issues with him being free to roam. He loses some of the psychological edge and eerie charm that made him so fascinating. By making him the focal point we almost gain and lose a character. Lecter remains engaging despite this. The character almost develops into a protagonist given the odds against him, but it simply can't happen due to his nature. But it's a testament to his intrigue that we want to see him survive and make it out somehow, if nothing else but to see what his next actions are.Hannibal's unpleasantness knows no bounds and that is part of its strength surprisingly. The film isn't afraid to be very disturbing and really show us the mind-set of these deeply troubled individuals and I really do admire it for that. It's not as psychologically scary as its predecessor but it goes for more upfront scares than ones that lurk in the darkness. The most important thing is most of the gory imagery doesn't feel as if it was done solely for shock value. It is usually set up well and the set-pieces themselves make the gruesomeness feel justified. The film remains engaging throughout, impressive given much of the subject manner, though it undoubtedly loses its way in the last 30 minutes. The first half works brilliantly due to its ever-building sense of dread and because the plot threads are delivered so captivatingly. Then as the film keeps building it appears unsure of how to tie everything up. By the time we get to a man eating his own brain you feel as if the film is really pushing it, just seeing how grisly it can get. The eventual ending feels a little misplaced and it doesn't really offer the closure for the characters that it should. In fairness Ridley Scott, who is a strange yet interesting directorial choice, has done a fantastic job to carry over most of such a bizarre novel and make it coherent. Some of the most out-there aspects are retained so it is difficult not to appreciate his bravery.This is not an easy film to like, mainly because it's not designed to be, and it will undoubtedly be viewed as too distasteful by many. I for one find myself respecting the film a lot. So much so that I am willing to let minor issues slip by and even though the film is flawed on the whole. How a film about a cannibal, a disfigured child molester, a stern FBI agent and all the grotesque imagery that comes with that is constantly engaging is a pretty amazing feat. The film works for me because it's a sequel that isn't afraid to change itself into something else, even if the characters don't always connect and it does lose its way at times. It's made with creativity, dynamism and understanding, all of which shines throughout the film.",Hannibal

202,Panterken,Hannibal,6,16 March 2008,"'Hannibal' for me, was an interesting opportunity to judge the transition from book to film, I can't be considered a regular reader so in this rare instance where I read the novel before watching Ridley's Scott's interpretation, I felt obliged to leave a comment for those who may not have read the book.From hear-say 'Hannibal' reputed to be a major disappointment for 'Silence of the Lambs' fans, Hannibal supposed to have been much less scary and the story much less original or interesting. After viewing, I must agree with both points. Hannibal Lecter, in 'Hannibal', shows a whole new spectrum of characteristics, humor, violence, erotic desire, craving for attention, snob, some of which came forward in SOTL already but surely not all of them, at least not to a great extent. Harris was obliged to round his villain, in both Red Dragon and Silence of The Lambs Lecter isn't the central character, merely a tool handled to catch another creep. This formula worked better, the few scenes where Lecter is shown are very effective: truly scary and disturbing. By giving the cannibal a wealth of screen time and portraying him calmly making dinner or lazily strolling around an art gallery, the intrigue is gone and that perhaps is Harris' biggest mistake when writing the sequel under the pressure of the raving success of it's two predecessors. The almost perfect novel and film SOTL was a finished story. Sure, there were some story lines left open for intrigue reasons but there was little left to tell about Clarice Starling, who was the main character not Hannibal or Buffalo Bill, and Harris just wrote the sequel because everyone insisted (I'm sure his publisher one of them, but also the public in general). This for me, is a sufficient explanation of why the story is very different from that in the first one. 'Hannibal' is a film built around, well, Hannibal Lecter himself as the title clearly indicates. The script was left in the more than competent hands of director Ridley Scott, creator of brilliant pictures like Gladiator and Blade Runner. The script stays very true to the source material, the order of some scenes is rearranged but the gross of them is present in the novel. I was especially pleased with Mason Verger, Oldman delivers a great performance even if he is nothing more than a voice almost the entire runtime. His delivery is the perfect amount of tongue-in-cheek, the black humor and suffering also mixed in. His face wasn't as disgusting as I'd pictured it in the novel, believe it or not, but no make-up artist in the world can match the depths of one's imagination. I feel they could have done more with the exquisite locations in Florence, I wasn't very impressed with the way they chose them. The city is, as most Italian cities I've frequented, perfect for filming locations, beautiful spots all around. Instead, they chose to approach the story more soberly, letting it be a pure horror/thriller and not something that rises above that artistically. The excess of one dimensional secondary characters is remarkable and strange, the Italian inspector, Mason Verger, Verger's physician were all very much cardboard characters, the story would've worked much better if they'd just scratched the Italian storyline out, at least make it shorter and focus more on Verger's relationship with Lecter. This, for me, would've made it much better. They set up Verger as a very intriguing character, a crippled, disturbed but incredibly wealthy man. A smörgåsbord of opportunities there, opportunities left unexplored unfortunately. The film would've also benefited from less graphic gore and more tension instead. Hannibal felt too much like a horror movie, extraordinary horror mind you, but just horror with gratuitous violence and a lot of slashing. This, to disguise, that the story isn't very thrilling or clever, at least not compared to it's prequel. Scott's 'Hannibal' also does a few things right of course, Moore is a different Clarice but she's surprisingly convincing, the bizarre relationship between Starling and Lecter is further explored which is interesting, and the production values are great as can be required of Scott. I'm a huge fan of both Manhunter and SOTL, two brilliant films (if you don't calculate the Miami Vice soundtrack) and 'Hannibal' is just the ugly duckling in comparison. Hopkins looks rather bored playing Hannibal on auto-pilot, only a ghost of the terror he portrayed in SOTL and the film is guilty of relying on fancy trivia like the all engorging pigs and the hanging of Judas, etc. All of this, next to being moderately entertaining, diversions from the weakness of the plot itself.Ta ta,",Hannibal

OK, there are a few gory and stomach-churning scenes, and Gary Oldman's performance as Mason Verger was rather good, but Hannibal is a poor sequel.Hannibal evokes a sense of fear and downright disgust, but not to the extremes of the award-winning 1990 film. Anthony Hopkins retains his sense of evil and dread as Lecter up to a point, but the climax to this film did leave me both pleased and surprised.Julianne Moore took over from Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling, and it was a good choice. It was a shame Foster did not want to revive the role herself, but we can feel the same sense of compassion and vulnerability for Moore's interpretation.The main aspect of this movie that pleased me is the cold and subdued atmosphere and surroundings created by Scott. The dark and brooding sense of terror mixed with the stunning images of Florence work together extremely well.Hannibal is an OK sequel to one of the most celebrated thrillers of all time, but if I personally had to choose between this and The Silence of the Lambs, I'd opt for the latter.",Hannibal

Not even the efforts of such superb actors as Hopkins and Moore, or the direction of Ridley Scott can keep this preposterous film afloat. And the main reason for this, is quite simply, the very novel it is based upon. In both book and film, gone is everything that made the characters of Hannibal and Starling so fascinating, replaced only with gore and a constant need to up the shock value factor. Now, I'm perfectly fine with shlocky, campy horror films, but to degrade such complex, mysterious characters to cartoon characters is simply disrespectful. And truth be told, this film doesn't even function that well as a straight horror pic. It's far too busy keeping up the appearance of sophistication, thus never allowing it's colorful characters to become as unhinged as they should be. Furthermore, the concept of Lector's interest in Starling being degraded to nothing but cliched sexual attraction is crushingly disappointing. It's staying true to the novel, of course, but this is a film adaptation of a novel that never should have happened. Neither can decide whether they want to uphold the thoughtful tone of the previous works, or descend into grindhouse horrors. And the two approaches only cancel each other out together. This is truly an embarrassing, pointless, cheesy endeavor for all involved. It destroys everything that made it's predecessor so masterful, and reduces Hopkins to playing a more well-mannered Freddy Kruger. Not the sequel that fans deserved, or wanted.",Hannibal
209,lostintwinpeaks,This sequel breaks the silence and proves that Julianne is a match for Jodie.,7,6 March 2001,"""Hannibal"" is quite a provocative movie. It lures you in, from its relatively brief opening scene, and keeps its hold tight until the end. A much different movie than ""Silence of the Lambs"", it is not as psychological - relying more on a killer-on-the-loose approach. Anthony Hopkins is back on form as the infamous Dr. Lecter (though he seems to have toned-down the role - his style here is more subtle than in ""Silence""); while Julianne Moore steps into Jodie Foster's shoes with a remarkable style and grace - it was no doubt quite an unnerving experience for the actress, considering the role of Clarice Starling won Ms. Foster an Oscar. However, Ms. Moore most definitely pulls it off. Kudos to her. Stylish, ominous, deeply-layered and -textured - ""Hannibal"" is an interestingly complex movie. The direction (surprising for Ridley Scott) is tight and well-paced, as is the editing. The script is superbly evocative and daring, and the use of classical/opera music throughout gives the movie an edgy feel - heightening the tension as if by default.

I'm not sure what we're meant to take away from the ending.A few other things to mention:
The pacing was off throughout the movie... I think overall it was a bit too slow and boring.I really wanted to like the new Clarice, but I couldn't warm to her character - which is a major issue seeing as the movie is heavily based on the relationship between Hannibal & Clarice.

Ray Liotta is also excellent as her FBI superior who had/has a crush on her. Giancarlo Giannini also excels in his role.I don't know why, but there is a feeling that something is missing here. Perhaps the writers just didn't give it their 100% or they fell into their own trap of building up more than they could eventually follow up. Anyway,this is an enjoyable film because of the atmosphere and also because it gives some introspection into the character of Hannibal Lecter, uncovering some of his past.Gary Oldman is ""seen"" here in a really scary incarnation and it alone adds some morbid feel that makes this film able to compete with its predecessor in terms of sick and disturbing images. Yet,this was obviously a misfired project that should have been worked out more carefully. Perhaps because Scott was just finished with his great success ""Gladiator"", he didn't have enough time to work on this one properly.

Here he's in the spot light and not very interesting or cool, saying things like ""Okie dokie"" and ""Goodie goodie.""  It feels like Hopkins is just going through the motions here and Julianne Moore is out of place as Clarice.  Gary Oldman's brilliance is really the only thing worthwhile about the flick.

216,Michael Kenmore,One of the worst movies of 2001,1,21 August 2001,"Hollywood has churned out yet another garbage that's wildly overhyped and underwhelming on a first-time viewing basis. Hannibal is bad, terrible, inept, lame, droll, idiotic, contrived, laughable and utterly atrocious (no pun intended). Minor spoilers follow...This movie has huge logic holes - more than any Bruckheimer/Bay movie -  or for that matter - any movie that exemplify the indulgence of Hollywood exaggeration. It's a slick Hollywood production designed to cash in on Hannibal Lector mania, directed by ""so-somber-he-takes-this-way-too-seriously"" hack director Ridley Scott and produced by a hack Italian producer with an inflated ego whose credo is ""doesn't matter whether film is s**t, money is good"".I can't get over the fact that acclaimed screenwriters David Mamet and Steven Zaillian wrote this tripe adapted from a lame and pretentious book by a good-novelist-turned-hack-author Thomas Harris. David and Steven - well-known and immensely talented screenwriters - wasted their effort on a poor screenplay in exchange for fat paychecks. Another factor in the disappointment of this film.There are too many ludicrous scenes to list that are laughable in clunky execution and poor logic e.g. Starling/Pazzi cell-phone in the midst of Lecter pursuit that turns up Inspector Pazzi as the victim. Not to mention laughably bad dialogues delivered by Tony Hopkins with a smirk and Julianne Moore, Ray Liotta and others who cannot act with the straight face. Hopkins gives the true meaning of ""scenery-chewing"" along with hammy acting by Gary Oldman as a deformed psychopath bent on exacting revenge against Lecter.The gore effect is good, but only serves to repulse rather than provide suspense which is notably absent from Hannibal. The predecessor - Silence of the Lambs - is more believable with tension and suspense. Suspense is what made Silence of the Lamb work as a spectacular mix of psychological horror and thriller, not to mention superbly written and tensely directed. The ""brain dinner"" sequence is so laughably fake it borders on self-parody.The ending is kinda blatant and idiotic - are we supposed to believe that Lecter is still a menace to society with the last shot establishing his glittering eye glaring at you?

If my memory serves me correctly, Harris wad paid a ton of money to write it. It wasn't 'organic' so to speak.Although Juliane Moore gave it her best, she would have been better off to turn down this impossible role. Foster's performance in SOTL was one of its main selling points, this is something the makers of Hannibal failed to realize.Ultimately, this was a desperate attempt to cash in on a successful film that was ten years old.

Those hopes quickly flew out the window. It is quite impossible to imagine this directed by the same man who gave us Alien and Blade Runner, since there is virtually none of the control of the medium here, that he displayed in those movies. What a waste of time and money, but it will still be a big box-office success, and a movie which sells itself, despite its sloppy execution. Hannibal is an utterly inept movie, perhaps more so to readers of Harris novel. The book was a real page-turner, cleverly plotted and impressively constructed. The screenplay, however, while with a pretty clever new ending, rushes through several important scenes, abandons some dramatic set-pieces which would have been great, and re-constructs some subplots so that they completely loose their dramatic potential. There is also a brief scene which is in direct contradiction to events described in ""Silence of the lambs"". What remains is a movie which is sketchy, un-atmospheric, undramatic, devoid of characterization and is always effective in reminding us that were only watching a movie, due to the fact that it's style is reminiscent of an extended rock video. It serves only to push the viewer OUT of the movie. Do we need the incessant, boring music on every scene? Do we really need the supposedly ""scary"" ambient sounds to underline the fact that Lecter is an evil dude? Do we need to have plot twists signalled way too early and loud? Do we need this movie? No. Since visiting Florens recently I felt compelled to re-watch Hannibal and perhaps re-evaluate it. Sadly I almost find it more inept and lazy the second time around. Ridley must have directed it from the back of a limo. possible spoilers The Italian detective is made out to be a loser from the first time we see him, is he going to be the guy who catches Lecter? No way. In the book he seemed to have a decent chance at least. What I still find mind-boggingly amateurish from a director such as Ridley is the staging of Lecters attack on the nurse seen through a surveillance camera. The event as it is described in the book, and in SOTL, has Lecter lying down, strapped on a bed. Hopkins delivers when he can, which is not often enough here, and sadly there is no authenticity to the Florens scenes, there is too much of a ""big-name actor sits at a café in Florens surrounded by a large film crew""-feeling. I would have liked to see Hannibal directed by William Friedkin in his French Connection mode. A documentary approach would have grounded the story somewhat, as it did in The Exorcist.",Hannibal
220,shaid,What a boring mess!!,3,8 April 2001,"""This review may contain spoilers""Even before going on release the movie had to pass 2 burdens: The burden of a sequel and the burden of adapting a book.A good sequel(not to mention an excellent one) will give us the viewers new things we didn't know from the first film, it will take the hero's at least one step further and in short will make it interesting for us. The burden of adapting the book is not less easier since you have to choose what changes to make what to delete and what to leave.SOLT is an excellent example of a very good adaptation. ""Hannibal"" is an perfect example for how badly things can go wrong.When I saw the movie I was few hours after finishing the book and it was still fresh in my mind. The changes David Mamet & Steven Zaillian(2 talented screen writers) made, turned a powerful book to a very messy film. I accept that changes  had to be made and I admit that Thomas Harris' book is a difficult one to adapt,because it is about control & power,which are very hard to translate,but the changes  and omissions made here simply ruined the story.Here are some examples: Deleting the whole sadistic behavior of Mason Verger towards children and deleting the whole story line of his sister Margot left Mason death meaningless and pointless.Deleting Jack Crawford from the story left me with no reason to why Clarice Starling eventually gave up to Hannibal Lecter. Deleting the whole Memory Palace of Dr.Lecter left me with no reason to his action. What is left are chain of events which have no meanings. All these omissions are things that could give me the extra thing that can make a sequel interesting and intriguing and they are the big changes, the small ones simply just added to the fact that someone has done a very sloppy job here.Some other aspects of the movie:Ridley Scott - Did you see him during the Oscar. He looked tired, agitated and burned out. His work here as sloppy as the script he was filming. It is almost 20 years after ""Blade Runner""(one of my all time favorite),and since than, what he has done, has not even came closer to that achievement and I think he will never do.Anthony Hopkins - Nothing is left from the menace that his Lecter had in SOTL. Something was missing in his performance. He looked bored and uninterested in the whole project.Julianne Moore - An excellent actress,but her Clarice Starling is lack of passion, a one Jodie Foster brought to the role.To sum everything up this is simply a boring movie. It is not even bad enough to make me angry. It was so boring that by the end I couldn't care less what happened on the screen in front of me. Shame though, because as they say ""The book is much better"" and it had a huge potential for a good movie.",Hannibal
221,the-gossip-king,Not as good as Silence of the Lambs but better than Red Dragon,8,27 April 2008,"Not as good as Silence of the Lambs but better than Red Dragon and Hannibal Rising. I am really disappointed about how badly this movie was received. They used a different director and a different style which makes the movie all the more original. I have read the novel and I was glad about how the adaption turned out. Anthony Hopkins was absolutely brilliant as usual and in this movie he gets a lot more screen time which is something that the Silence of the Lambs lacked. Jullianne Moore was perfect for the role this time because between the ten years of this series of events she had become a different person and Moore does that very well. Saying that Jodie Foster will always be my Clarice. Although the acting was good all round I praise the most, Ridley Scott. He took a bizarre novel and turned it into something amazing. His ideas were perfect and turned this movie into something great. Instead of chills he used thrills. It is a different technique and both work for the Separate movies! Highly recommended.",Hannibal
222,Kashmirgrey,Lecter Defined,7,7 March 2007,"It is such a rarity that sequels supersede their predecessors in quality. ""Hannibal"" is one such rarity. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" introduced us to Hannibal Lecter, but ""Hannibal"" defines him as a character.Although I was disappointed at first to hear that Jodie Foster was replaced by Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling, Moore was the more favorable, overall, to play the part. Foster was too boyish, while Moore brought the femininity missing from Starling in ""The Silence of the Lambs."" I cannot picture Foster pulling off the final scenes of Hannibal in an evening gown without seeming lumpishly out of place.The real credit goes to Anthony Hopkins, though. I cannot think of a single actor better suited as Lecter. Hopkins brings believability to the character. His cunning, his charm, his intelligence, patience, dark sense of humor... were all mastered by Hopkins. The ending was deliciously (forgive the pun) gruesome, albeit not for those with weak stomachs.I think the film would have been best if it had been slightly longer and felt a bit rushed in the last fifteen minutes. Character development also fell a bit short with some of the co-stars (Ray Liotta as Paul Krendler, for example.) Yet, overall, a very enjoyable film, and an excellent contribution to the Lecter saga.",Hannibal
223,giancarlorocks,An inferior yet thoroughly entertaining film !!,10,19 August 2001,"A long awaited sequel that was waited upon for ten years will naturally have a level of anticipation that can overshadow the film itself. That is possibly a great way to describe the frenzy surrounding Ridley Scott's follow-up to the 1991 thriller Silence of the Lambs'. This time, Hannibal' sets itself apart very quickly from the original. Jonathon Demme directed the first Hannibal Lecter outing, which centered around a crazed cannibalistic killer who had the key to finding another crazed killer on the prowl. The first movie centered upon the direct relationship between FBI agent Clarice Starling (then played by Jodie Foster), and Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). Demme focused upon this relationship and in a subtle way insinuated towards a mutual sense of admiration between the law enforcer and the law abider. All this meshed up in a psychologically intense, elegant and brilliant film.     This time, Gladiator' director Ridley Scott does what he does best, he delivers a straightforward popcorn flick, which lacks both the intensity and the psychological disturbance within one's mind that the first movie caused. Scott abandons any style of a psychological film and imposes the film upon us in a truly elegant manner in which the film creeps up on us, but nowhere near the way in which the first one did.      This ultimately leads me to wonder if Scott intentionally envisioned this style. He probably knew he could not make a film superior to its original, and therefore brought the film his way. Elegant, classy and well crafted, yet lacked the substance to truly make it a terrifying piece of fiction. Hannibal' is not a scary, nor terrifying film. Anthony Hopkins reprises his role as the crazed killer obsessed with FBI agent Starling, here played with Julianne Moore. Bar none, Hopkins is terrific. He IS Hannibal. As he preys upon his victims, his soothing voice caresses the scene, extracting that sub-lime genre of the conventional slasher', catapulting him into the area of a classy, well-educated killer, which seems to have a purpose in killing his victims. Yet, Julianne Moore will be the focus of the film as she takes over from Foster. Yet, do not be alarmed, she is merely a secondary character who takes a backseat to all the events catered around Hannibal.     The film is well done. Scott will probably disappoint the die-hard fans of the first who expect a psychologically intense film that will stay with fans long after the film is over, such as the first one. But, it is a fun film. Seeing Hopkins bite into his character is well worth the price of admission all in itself. This truly proves what a great actor he is.
     Furthermore, as we track Hannibal in Italy where he is in seclusion, during that time the film maintains a touch of brilliance and class as we discover that he realizes something is wrong. The characters in this film are fun, Gary Oldman plays Mason Verger, a hideously disfigured man who was a victim that escaped Hannibal's grasp, and trust me, the make-up that Oldman endures for the film will make no one eat pop-corn in the theatre. Ray Liotta also stars and Giancarlo Giannini does an incredible piece at playing an Italian detective who is troubled by Hannibal's presence. This film is well-done, fun to watch yet in no way as great as the original. And I believe it has something to do with the fact of the settings. The first half is mostly set in Italy creating a sense of elegance, and      Hopkins is brilliant as he is a subtle simple man living in Italy. Yet, when the movie sets itself for the final 40 minutes, this is where it comes apart becoming clichéd, somewhat ludicrous as you will see in the climax and whereby it gives in to the Hollywood norm of blood, a few attempted chills and a disappointing ending.
See it for yourself, and then you will understand. Despite all these flaws, you will still manage to have a great time, this movie is fun, and it seems as if it Scott wanted it that way. He crafts a pretty good film, intentionally drawing away from the first one, but the dip in the film after it leaves Italy results in a disappointing climax that will leave audiences somewhat with their stomachs upside-down. But hey, it is Hannibal The Cannibal' after all. In the end, a good film, but unfortunately does not try to set itself apart from other conformist thrillers, resulting in the audience leaving the theatre perhaps wanting more, yet at the same time asking why?Giancarlo's Rating: **1/2 (out of four)",Hannibal
224,darkjosh,An Unsatisfying Meal,5,16 February 2001,"With the exception of only a handful of films, sequels are destined to be lesser counterparts to the original.  Hannibal falls into that trap, and though Ridley Scott's dynamite, razor-sharp direction of Gladiator helped propel that movie to critical and box-office success, he seems to be going through the motions in Hannibal.Hannibal brings back the psychotic yet intellectual creation that is Anthony Hopkin's Dr. Hannibal Lecter, who has been reclusive in Europe since his escape in 1991.  He re-emerges when Agent Clarice Starling becomes victim of a smear campaign (led by Ray Liotta) against her questionable actions during a routine FBI sting.  While Julianne Moore tackles the role of Starling with such skill that the pall of Jodie Foster never befalls her, Anthony Hopkins' role seems severely underwritten.  He's the title character, yet we spend more than half the time focused on subplots involving far less intriguing characters, including an Italian detective and a vengeful victim, played by an almost unrecognizable Gary Oldman.  And as much as it pains to say, Ray Liotta seems to be losing more and more the chance to redeem himself with every dislikeable, cardboard role he plays.  Also, while Scott's use of shaky cinematography may have worked well in bloody, medieval battles, this visual style is distracting here.  Can't we actually see a battle between Hopkins and co. instead of a camera jittering above their struggle? 
Hannibal is, at best, a plodding, redundant, and poorly written movie that bears little to no resemblance to the stylish, dark, and intelligent thriller Silence of the Lambs (besides the characters).  It's thoroughly uneven and plays more like a big-budget slasher flick than a grisly, engrossing thriller.  Stick to the original, where hearing Dr. Lecter make sucking sounds for two seconds is much more enjoyable than this misfire.5 out of 10",Hannibal
225,mrbluto,An average movie at best,6,4 October 2001,"The two things that made me not want to see this movie in a theatre was the fact that Jodie Foster and Jonathan Demme thought the script was bad enough they did not want to be in it, the second thing is it could never be as good as silence, that being said here is my review. Hannibal took the great stillness of silence and threw it out, the outstanding psychotic minds games between Hannibal and Starling are gone,left in it's place is a really dumb story of Lecter working in a museum in Florence, starling needs to be the main story with Lecter being left in the shadows where he works best, Gary Oldman was wasted, you never ever have a evil second creep in a movie with Lecter, he is the evil one and trying to make people sympathize with him is wrong. 6 out of 10",Hannibal
226,arturmachado-29588,Awful script,4,22 January 2017,"Sequel to the acclaimed ""Silence of the Lambs"", the problem with this movie is that it as such an awful script that nothing else can save it; which is a shame given the big names involved.Ridley Scott is one of the best directors ever, and although he manages some interesting sequences, he is not a miracle worker given the awful script that he has to work with; besides, the pace is slow and for 2 hours, in this regard, less would be more given the awful script that he has to work with.Anthony Hopkins is the only reason to watch this movie, still managing to deliver charisma to his character; the problem are the scenes where he kills: has always to say some 'clever' line before the kill (which is utterly stupid and unrealistic) and some attitudes are inconsistent with his personality and this is because of... you guessed it, the awful script.Julianne Moore does what she can with the awful script and dialogue given to her, but simply can't make forget Jodie Foster.Gary Oldman delivers a bizarre performance, and I mean it as a compliment (he is always good at that :D), and Ray Liota is always cool to watch.This movie is more gory, which I don't mind, but those scenes seemed more comic than frightening, with one exception... the ending...Recomendable just to those really interested in the franchise.",Hannibal
227,A_Llama_Drama,A dark love letter,7,12 April 2021,"Hannibal (2001) is a far cry from Silence of the Lambs. The latter was dark, oppressive and carried a nasty atmosphere where a cannibalistic madman was the only character that FBI agent Clarice Starling could rely on, even if he was always just mere seconds from gutting someone. Although there was a story about a psycho skinning women for a skin suit and Clarice was on a mission to catch him, it was her relationship with Hannibal and the other men around her that drove the movie forward. Anthony Hopkins, appearing in less than 40 minutes of a 2 hour long movie won an Oscar for Best Actor in a lead role, that's how integral the mad prisoner was to the film.This sequel is almost a reverse of that. Here, it's Hannibal's inability to forget Clarice that drives the film. As such, gone is the oppressive, paranoid atmosphere of a young woman entering a dangerous world, replaced by a dreamy, erotic patchwork of gore, music and poetry. This is Hannibal's film, through and through.Clarice is still dealing with sexism in the work place, but she's happy to challenge the higher ups. Hannibal is practising in Florence, a man of high society. He can't pull himself away from Clarice, though, and after sending a letter, begins a new game of cat and mouse, sucking in victims and victimisers as it plays out. One of the players, Verger, is intent on butchering Hannibal after Hannibal convinced him to cut his own face to pieces. Another, Pazza, is an Italian detective who experiences the philosophies of each of the three main players (Clarice's knowledge and desire to do the right thing, Verger's money and desire for vengeance, Hannibal's charm and desire to live his perverted life in peace), and ends up caught in middle.20 years on and each of the victims Hannibal takes are images not quickly forgotten. Even watching it now, it's hard not to squirm when brains are fried and fed to the owner, pigs feast on skulls and guts drop from balconies in Florence.It's not as good as the predecessor, and it's got some problems with effects (the dizzying speed changes during ""important moments"" is rather trite and annoying), but Hannibal presents the flipside of Clarice's viewpoint. Not a violent world of oppression and ugliness but one of beauty, grace and passion.",Hannibal
228,jonathandoe_se7en,Not as bad as people have said...,7,30 August 2001,"Okay, so Hannibal isn't Silence of the Lambs (1991), I don't think people should go watching this film expecting that it is. It picks up ten years after the original silence (okay, so Manhunter in the original but I don't want to get down to that right now). Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore) is in some hot water after a shoot out goes wrong and is assigned to visit reclusive billionaire Mason Verger (an un-recognisable Gary Oldman, but more on that later) about the whereabouts' of everyone's favourite cannibal Dr Lector (Hopkins). All right, so the plot isn't much, it begins with a revenge trap, and then becomes some kind of Grand Guignol romantic horror, with some broad black comedy thrown in. Where the film's strength lies is in Ridley Scott's evocative depiction of Rome, painting Florence as the same kind of dangerous and vibrant metropolis that made the LA of Blade Runner so memorable. The weakness however lies in the script, yes, there are some plot holes and a few of the characterisation seem under developed, but these are only minor floors. Now lets get down to what makes this film really great. Firstly, we have Hopkins reprising the role of Lector, let out of the ""dungeon"" and allowed free reign of terror around Rome and the US. There is a certain feeling that once the beast is out of the cage; so to speak, a sense of terror is lost. But Lector is still terrifying, going way over the top in pursuit of Clarice. Also, we have one of the greatest villains ever with Verger, one of Lector's former patients who has had his face completely removed (in one of the film's more disturbing scenes), Oldman layered under a ton of make up allows himself become Verger, a little over the top maybe, but wouldn't you be a irate if you'd had you're face peeled off.The film builds a beautiful tension, with the help of Hans Zimmer's operatic score, even if the film loses marks for the slightly stupid final ""tea part scene""... And you get the feeling that Scott's a little bored with shooting the American landscape but over all this is a decent enough effort, definitely worth you're time and money.

A sequel Masterpiece.,10,4 December 2006,"Far superior to the overrated The Silence Of The Lambs, Ridley Scott's ten years on sequel of Thomas Harris's gruesome novel is fairly faithful to the original story.Jodie Foster is not missed for one second, as Julianne Moore comfortably makes the role of Clarice starling her own. She is nothing more than excellent in the role.Anthony Hopkins is brilliant as ever as Doctor Hannibal Lecter, and what makes this film more appealing is the fact he is on the prowl all throughout where he was confined in a cage in Silence Of The Lambs. This is also truly darker than any other Lecter movie, more darker than Manhunter.The music score by Hans Zimmer is brilliant. Especially the scene where Lecter, Pazzi and Pazzi's wife are watching the opera in Florence and he uses this music again when Lecter returns to America. I also liked the small adventure that Lecter has with Inspector Pazzi which ends in a rather brilliant gruesome conclusion before he leaves for America.One of the best films of 2001.",Hannibal

I have to say though this movie really doesn't have a point except to show us a lot of gore. The movie is so graphic infact that it's hard for me to imagine how it did not get an NC-17 rating. Maybe at the youngest someone 16 could see this movie, but I don't know how you make a case that someone younger than that should.

In between there's disembowelings, slit throats, a faceless pedophile (he got that way by peeling it off, at Hannibal's suggestion, and feeding it to his dog), hands being chopped off, people having their brains eaten while they're still alive, and much more to delight any true fan of blood & guts. There's little effort at subtlety here, if it's disgusting, it's in there. Does this film make a worthy successor to ""Silence of the Lambs""? Not a chance. At best it rates maybe 5 out of 10, and that's being mighty generous.Still, one can't really fault Ridley Scott or the cast. They did the best they could with the mess they were given in the form of Thomas Harris's novel of the same name. The truth is, ""Lambs"" was the sort of story that was ill suited to a sequel of any kind. Like ""Casablanca"", it ended on a perfect note, and any effort to revisit the principal characters later in their lives was bound to be a big disappointment. Adding all the gross parts seemed to be a smokescreen to hide the fact that the plot and characters in ""Hannibal"" just don't work very well. It's easy to see why Jodie Foster refused to have anything to do with this production. Although Hopkins does a decent job playing Hannibal, his performance is nowhere near as mesmerizing and menacing as in ""Lambs"". Perhaps that's because he and his character are ten years older, and it shows. The Hannibal of ""Lambs"" looked lean, mean, and very fit, whereas in this movie he looks like he's about ready to retire to his rocking chair and start collecting his Social Security checks. Julianne Moore is OK, but is just no substitute for the original. But mostly the problem is that the story is just nowhere near as gripping, no matter who starred or directed. Methinks Messr's Harris, Scott, and Hopkins would have been best served by simply letting Hannibal slip away into the mist at the end of ""Lambs"" and left his future wanderings to our imaginations.",Hannibal

The Film: (A definite improvement over the Thomas Harris novel, on which it is based) Hannibal goes into hiding in Florence, Italy.  He is currently on the Bureau's top ten wanted criminals list.Things aren't going so well for Clarice Starling.  Until now she has been riding on the coattails of having heroically-and single-handedly-killed Jame Gumb (Serial-killer `Buffalo Bill' from the previous film ""Silence of the Lambs."").  Her altruistic reputation is tarnished after a botched drug raid.Subscribing to various newspapers and tabloids, Hannibal soon finds out about Starling's predicament and resumes communication with his favorite female correspondent.  It seems the young secret agent still has some things to learn about her humble origins and the ruthlessness of bureaucratic ulterior motives.Meantime Hannibal's sole surviving victim, multimillionaire Mason C. Verger, has been plotting his revenge against Hannibal Lector.  Mason is a mess. Grotesque face (bad skin grafts do nothing to improve his countenance--Gag!), and an equally monstrous personal psychology have not helped his situation.  Hannibal, Clarice and Mason are brought together thanks to the greedy diligence of the Florentine detective, Rinaldo Pazzi, who figures out that Hannibal is living under the name of Dr. Fell, an art historian and connoisseur.

236,Funky A,"""I'm having an old friend for dinner..."" should have been Hannibal's last line...",4,6 March 2001,"Very weak... Hannibal is just a bad movie which would never have gotten any attention if it hadn't been the sequel to the excellent Silence of the Lambs... OK, maybe it had three high-caliber actors and one excellent director which had just done one of 2000's most popular movie(Gladiator), but let's set things straight... Gary Oldman is an incredibly talented actor but in this movie, he is not playing a role. The make-up he has is the only thing he is... It does the job for him. All he has to do is sit there and talk with so much make-up on his face it is impossible for him to be normal, so his job is easy. Any actor could have done what he has done in this movie... Good gross make-up, though... Julianne Moore too, can be very good, as she as proved in Magnolia, but in Hannibal, she reminds us that she can also be bad just like she was in The Lost World: Jurassic Park. As for Anthony Hopkins, he is still a great actor and Hannibal Lecter is such a great character that it is hard for him to do a bad job, and he doesn't do that. Lecter is still the attractive/disgusting character we know and love but the script he has makes it impossible for him to be half as good as he was in Silence of the Lambs. Hannibal is now a wise one-liner machine instead of the complex character he once was... And if you still consider Ray Liotta a major actor, this movie should convince you that he doesn't deserve respect. Last but not least, Ridley Scott, the director, even if he still knows how to play with lights and shadows(see Blade Runner for the ultimate proof of that), can't save this film from it's incredibly poor script. The movie starts with a cheap action sequence that seems to have as only use to fill our craving for action since absolutely nothing will happen for the next hour and a half... This script is actually the ultimate ""What should not be done in a thriller"". It seems David Mamet convinced himself that if nothing happens in this movie, maybe he could make it become one of those intelligent thrillers he usually writes(Mission: Impossible, The Spanish Prisonner)... For a thriller to be intelligent, it needs to be thrilling as well as complex and needs solid characters. None of the characters in this movie are almost believable. For example, how could a dumb macho cop such as Ray Liotta's character get such an important job in the FBI? This movie is about as thrilling as a race between five-hundred frozen shrimps... When I say nothing happens during most of the movie, it means NOTHING happens. Clarisse, which has become annoying has hell since the last time we saw her, looks at pictures. Hannibal makes cheap jokes while a cop almost makes something happen while ALMOST trying to catch him(his fate is clear from the moment you see his face). Then, in the last 30 minutes of the movie, everything happens fast and you have trouble understanding what his happening before finally, you understand at the end of the movie that there wasn't much that happened. What you get is the feeling that Hannibal Lecter isn't as fun as he used to be, Clarisse is now an annoying FBI agent and Gary Oldman should exploit his talents instead of putting them under a mask. And the ""extreme gore"" I was supposed to find was much more tame than I expected it to be. Every scene which should have been tense and gut-wrenching was diluted with cheap humor, even THAT scene at the end, which wasn't that terrible nor intense. The script is mediocre and only Hopkins and Scott seem to be trying to make things better. Hopkins is still good as Hannibal, though he is less intense(mostly because of the script) and Scott directs very well this movie. Another quality of the movie is it's excellent musical score... The rest is just trash...44%",Hannibal

""Silence"" held your interest in the sense that it was intriguing from start to finish, when you look in the mind of a serial killer, and must try to ensnare him. ""Hannibal"" doesn't go in terms of intrigue, it follows suspense and follows the characters years after Hannibal's escape. After having successfully eluded the authorities for years, Hannibal resides peacefully in Italy as a brilliant art scholar, who minds his own business, has classical women accompany him to opera, and speaks with his fellow scholars. However, things heat up when, back in the states, a vengeful victim, physically scarred beyond recognition, determines to destroy Hannibal with the cooperation of a corrupt FBI official and a corrupt detective. Clarice is suffering the wrath of that fellow FBI official while trying to survive a media hailstorm from a sting operation that went terribly wrong. Hannibal is determined to make contact with Clarice again while in the midst of trying to eliminate his enemies, in his own way. Anthony Hopkins returns to form as the iconic serial killer who reveals his character in the sequel, than in the original. Julianne Moore, while a very good actress, for some reason cannot be convincing enough in the role Jodie Foster had originated. Gary Oldman shows up unbilled as the victim intent on destroying Hannibal, and under all his makeup, he still manages to create a very twisted human being. Ray Liotta is decent in his role as the malicious FBI official but isn't convincing enough to be spited, his undoing at the end of the film is pretty much the mother of all gore in this movie.

241,MadReviewer,"Terrible Sequel, And A Terrible Film In Its Own Right",4,29 April 2001,"`Hannibal' should serve as proof of why some sequels should never be made -- it's fat, lazy, and content to merely rest on the laurels of the brilliant `Silence of the Lambs', while never bothering to say something original or to add something fresh to the ongoing series.  (I'll ignore the fact that `Hannibal' also made a boatload of money, which probably will insure that at least one more crappy sequel will be made at some point.) `Hannibal' was a movie with a lot of expectations to live up to -- and, quite frankly, it failed to live up to any of them.`Hannibal' continues the story of everybody's favorite refined, cultured, psychotic cannibal, Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins).  A decade after his escape from authorities, he's living comfortably in Italy, teaching art, living a wonderful existence.  Not fairing as well is Clarice Starling (played Julianne Moore in `Hannibal') -- she's bearing the responsibility for a failed FBI raid a la Waco, so she's reassigned to the touchy case of Hannibal as a way of making her disappear from the limelight.  Also thrown into this mix is a millionaire named Mason Verger (Gary Oldman), one of Hannibal's few victims that actually lived to tell the tale of his attack. Unstable and obsessed with Dr. Lecter, Verger wants to exact a little vengeance on Hannibal `the Cannibal', so he's started a hunt for Lecter that ultimately will cross paths with Starling's investigations.
The main problem with `Hannibal' is the simple fact that it makes little sense in its own right, and makes absolutely no sense whatsoever when held up against `Silence of the Lambs'.  Characters often seem to do things merely to propel along the plot to the next scene, not because they make any sense.  There are dozens of examples of this.  Clarice's `responsibility' in the botched FBI raid is an absolute joke.  While it's explained HOW Mason Verger was transformed by Lecter in a grotesque, adult-looking version of David Lynch's `Eraserhead', it's never explained WHY it happened, and that's a wee bit more important.  Also, at one point, one of Verger's employees decides to listen to Lecter about something important instead of Verger -- while Verger's not exactly the most sane employer on the planet, wouldn't you listen to the guy signing your paychecks instead of Hannibal `The Cannibal' Lecter?  It's a constant mess of contradictions that serve to continuously drag the movie down.Also surprising was the absolute lack of tension in the film.  Director Ridley Scott had the opportunity to fill the film with some nail-biting suspense -- after all, what could be scarier than Hannibal Lecter on the loose?  Instead, the movie moves along at a plodding pace, rarely scary, rarely tense -- gross and violent, yes, but the tension that filled `Silence of the Lambs' is but a memory in `Hannibal'.  Some of the scenes in Italy were stylish and worked effectively well -- in fact, I found myself wishing that the Italy sequences had been expanded to an entire film, and everything in the U.S. had been dropped -- but for a film rooted in the horror genre, it's surprisingly flat and boring.Hopkins is okay in his reprisal of the Lecter role, not great -- the character's developed more of a sense of humor this time around, but gone is the reptilian sociopath made famous in `Silence'.  In `Hannibal', he's not exactly a parody of what he used to be, but he's definitely a shadow of former greatness.  There's nothing new or interesting added to the Lecter character.  Julianne Moore does fine replacing Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling, considering there's little to work with and no substance to the role.  Gary Oldman chews the scenery to interesting, if not exactly great, effect as the loony Verger, and the one truly good character lost in the shuffle is the Italian detective Rinaldo Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini) who first finds Lecter.  Understated, gripping, and very good, Giannini's performance is the one small gem that can be found amidst the rest of this mess.Two grades for `Hannibal':  C- on its own merits for being a tepid, sluggish thriller with a handful of interesting moments, and a F for being the sorry excuse of a sequel to `Silence of the Lambs' and squandering the potential to be something truly great.  Avoid this film, it's not worth watching.",Hannibal

You just take it in a totally new direction. Hannibal isn't in prison pondering ; he is free and murderous.This film has far more disturbing scenes, including a character's brain being extracted while alive and anesthetized from pain. There's also a scene of Hannibal feeding someone to the pigs. The romantic element of Clarice's relationship with Hannibal is explored quite a bit. Jodi Foster is traded from Julianne Moore, as an older more hardened Clarice and the replacement does a fine job. Anthony Hopkins, thankfully, reprises his role as Hannibal. It's not necessary and it puts shock over substance at times, but it's still recommendable to passionate fans of the first movie.",Hannibal

Once you realize that the two works stand on their own it is much easier to appreciate the two. To be sure, ""Hannibal"" is infinitely more obvious than it's predecessor. ""Silence of the Lambs"" was more Clarice's story whereas this one is Hannibal's. Nor is there any compromise whatsoever in Julianne Moore's performance. She is quite simply, excellent. Jodie is not missed at all. Anthony Hopkins does a masterful job of recreating Dr. Lecter. The soundtrack which is positively beautiful while outlining some of the most grotesque scenes of violence I have ever witnessed only add to the wonder of the production. The shots of Florence are spectacular. Top notch!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Hannibal

Credit due to Moore, she had a lot of work to do, and she does an admirable job, I like her as an actress, and she does well here.Hopkins? Well, I'm not going to be biased just because I'm Welsh, but I didn't go overboard on him this time round. Sorry. He had such awful lines like ""okey-dokey"" and ""ta-ta"" to utter! Would Lecter ever say those words? Me thinks not. It spoilt the menacing Lecter we saw in ""Lambs"", that menace is missing in this film.Yes he can still kill people creatively, and have historical undertones to his killings, but boy should he retire.I'm not even going to talk about the plot, just go and watch the film.Gary Oldman actually puts in a good underrated performance, and the make-up is spot on.To be fair to this film though, it isn't absolute rubbish, there are some good moments to be had - you just have to wait for them to come to you!

246,Rhino Rover,"The book wasn't so good, neither is the movie.",6,6 April 2001,"The last movie that received this much hype and promotion was Star Wars Episode I. And was it worth the hype? Not really. It wasn't a terrible movie by any standards but the hype actually raised expectations beyond what was realistic and I felt a little bit disappointed afterwards. Hannibal suffers from a similar fate. It's not a bad movie but the hype raised expectations a bit too high. For this particular viewer, I actually had read the book before seeing it so already knew what the hype was all about and after it was all said and done, didn't understand what the hype was about.
Hannibal takes place several years after `Silence of the Lambs'. He has spent some time in Florence living a `normal' life and has been able to hide from the public by becoming a temporary curator for a local museum. Mean while back in the United States, Clarice Starling has resumed her life as an FBI agent and while never really rising to the promising career that she was heading for after her brush with the infamous Hannibal Lector, she has been able to carve out a relatively successful career with the Bureau. However, her life takes a dramatic turn when an operation she leads turns into a disaster. Although not her fault, she has become the scapegoat for the FBI and it is her name that is splashed all over the news and media. This unfortunate event begins to unravel a series of events that lead to the `re-emergence' of Hannibal Lector as his infatuation with her draws him out.
To be quite honest, the book wasn't that good and they based the movie on the book so there was bound to be some problems with it. The book was slow and ploddingthe movie was the same. The movie was aptly named as it does focus around the character of Hannibal and we see much of him. The audience is given a better view into Hannibal Lector's personality and idiosyncrasies but the storyline was so slow that there wasn't any real suspense built up and in the end, the ending kind of fizzled out. The main problem with this movie was that it seemed like two stories jammed into one. It starts out with the Starling character and sets up the scenario around her and then abruptly drops it and jumps to Florence. A large portion of the movie then revolves around Hannibal and his time in Florence and then the movie brings it back together towards the end with the Starling character meeting up with Hannibal. The movie just didn't have a good flow to it.	 Much of the hype the movie received revolved around the gore and there was some of it. The majority of it came at the end with the dinner scene but the rest of the movie was pretty standard stuff. It wasn't anything that we probably haven't scene on a Schwarzenegger movie and compared to the book, it was pretty watered down. Although the story was a bit weak, Sir Anthony Hopkins' performance was quite captivating. He seems to genuinely enjoy playing the role of Hannibal Lector and the role fits him quite well. Another really good performance was by Gary Oldman. He played the character of Mason Verger, the obsessed, deformed and only surviving victim of Hannibal looking for revenge. I found his character the most enjoyable to watch as he truly gives the impression of a sick, twisted man consumed by his desire to capture Hannibal and tortured him to death. Juliana Moore as Clarice Starling I wasn't so impressed. Jodie Foster created the character in SOTL and gave her character a quiet, strong and yet vulnerable character. Juliana wasn't quite able to bring that across in this movie. Rather the Starling character came across as a bit rigid. Overall, this movie wasn't worth the hype and the final dinner scene while shocking and a bit gratuitous could have been better. I actually found myself bored at some points and if I had a remote, probably would have just fast forwarded it to the gore stuff just to see what it was all about. My suggestion? See it as a matinee, or wait for it to come out on video but don't pay full price for it.",Hannibal

There's already been a lot of controversy surrounding the extremely gory scenes in this film, and there are a few, let me assure you. where silence of the lambs truly tried to fathom the psychology and minds of serial killers, the problem with hannibal is it feels like the entire story was cooked up just to gross out the audiences. as for the ending, well.. don't go see this if you're kind of squemish with this kind of stuff.

I can be one of the few who sees his movies as beautiful paintings, made with a lot of heart but with a lot of brain, and its' difficult to find that tin a modern director (because Ridley had been all his life a modern director, even when he did The duelists).Taking the original novel and making it all his, I advise that both are completely different (yeah, they have the main characters, but the comparisons end there).

251,Nigel St. Buggering,"If you thought ""Seven"" was brilliant, you'll love this. I don't",4,11 February 2001,"Like ""Seven"", this is essentially a gore film/freak show masquerading as art.  Many people will fall for the artistic pretension, and declare it brilliant, while many others will see it for the sadly plotless, character-free slasher film that it is.  What's most disturbing is that the feeling we got from ""Silence Of The Lambs"" is nowhere to be seen; that feeling that we were rooting for Lecter almost against our wills.  Here was clearly an evil human being, whom we nevertheless wanted to see get away...it was subversive in its way.  There is none of that here.  The people who die at Lecter's hands are despicable, and therefore ""deserve to die"".  And by the time the character is put in jeopardy (in a very silly, pulp-novel manner by a character who is more evil and twisted than he is), it becomes clear that the subversive creepiness of the first film has been thrown out and replaced with standard horror-film boo-hiss villainy.  I have nothing against cheap horror, but in making a sequel to one of the most effective examples of horror as art, they beg the comparison.  ""Hannibal"" doesn't stand up.  Considering the talent involved here, this movie had no business not being a brilliant follow-up.  What's most shocking is that a screenplay by no less than the team of David Mamet and Steven Zaillian can be so free of cleverness, imagination or meaning.

252,underfire35,One Of The Worst Films Ever Made...........,1,11 March 2004,"HANNIBAL is about little else besides self indulgence and, of course, profit. I did not read Thomas Harris' book, because it seemed like an obligatory cash cow sequel to the successful SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. Well, if the book is anything like the movie, that is exactly what it is. HANNIBAL is an overproduced product, a colorful display of big name talent that can be easily sold to the masses for $8.00 a ticket. Now, I know that most people would contend that the majority of mainstream American films would fall into that category. What with the endless drift of action films or teenage sex romps, true, but what the difference is is that Ridley Scott seems to think that HANNIBAL is an epic masterpiece, instead of the pulp trash it actually is. There's the rub. The subject matter is so tawdry and lurid, but yet held to such high esteem by Scott and his crew.The massive waste of talent is another unforgivable aspect of HANNIBAL. Consider the fact that the novel was adapted by no less than renowned playwrite David Mamet and Oscar winner Steve Zaillian, if in fact they distilled the best elements of the book into the screenplay, then the book is far worse than I can even imagine. The on screen talent does not get off any easier. Julianne Moore, who replaces Jodie Foster, is a good actor, but is reduced to a rat in a convoluted maze. Giancarlo Giannini, who plays Inspector Pazzi, turns in the best performance of the film, but should have saved it for a more worthy project. Ray Liotta can tear the screen apart with the right material (see the recent NARC), but is used poorly here. Anthony Hopkins seems tired and weary in rehashing the character that made him a household name ten years ago. You should know your movie is in serious trouble when Gary Oldman's appearance does not liven things up!The bulk of the blame should fall squarely on Scott, however. HANNIBAL is one of the most glaring examples of overdirecting in a film in recent memory. His busy overblown style may have worked for BLADE RUNNER and LEGEND, but not here. It is especially distracting because this is the ""sequel"" to SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. In SILENCE, the director, Jonathan Demme, used closeups and tight angles to create a tight unventilated feeling, something that Scott undermines, which would make viewing the two films in sequence jarring (although I never plan on watching HANNIBAL again). HANNIBAL is a good example of why Scott did not win best director for GLADIATOR.The plot of HANNIBAL is the stuff of comedy, except that it has such a sadistic overtone that it makes it hard to laugh; although, during the finale as the audience gasped in horror, I fell onto the floor unable to contain my hysteria. It is an ending that this film deserves, it reinforces what little respect Harris and Scott have for their audience. Little, if any. They serve up cheap gore in place of any logical conclusion, easy outs instead of answers. HANNIBAL insulted my intelligence and if there is one thing a film can do that I cannot forgive, it is that. 1/10.",Hannibal

It's probably not exactly what you wanted, but it just might be enough. No wonder lesser minds hate this movie: it's radically different from Silence a bloody, suspense-driven, darkly comedic love story between good and evil, a florid, grandiose thriller manifesto on why polar extremes need each other to survive. At its supreme best, Hannibal is a voyage into the depths of existential horror.An intriguing, fresh, firm and attractive endeavor that neither tries to borrow nor duplicate the atmosphere of its predecessor.Hannibal is a gruesome beauty-and-the-beast tale, in which the noble heroine keeps her virtue and her soul, while the monster battles his appetites and finds his own soul, single-handedly.",Hannibal
255,tripper0,just not as good as its predecessor....,6,25 November 2001,"'Hannibal', quite frankly, is barely good enough to be called and average movie.  Of course Anthony Hopkins is enjoyable as the title character, but acting is not the problem with this film.  Its been said many many times, but what caused the first movie to excel was the relationship between Clarice and Hannibal.  The scenes between Hopkins and Foster in 'Silence of the Lambs' are among the best and most intense I have ever seen, not to mention most interesting and dynamic. Its that dynamic that is missing in this movie.  I won't go so far as to blame Ridley Scott or even Foster's replacement, Julianne Moore.  In fact I generally like Moore's work.  No, the problem with this movie completely lies in the script.  The script lacks the depth that the script in the first movie had.  'Silence of the Lambs' was and intensely psychological thriller that kept you on the edge of your seat.  'Hannibal' is a mediocre attempted thriller, barely above your average slasher flick.  There are things that are supposed to be gross, that aren't.  And there is supposed to be suspense created in a chase to capture 'Hannibal'.  That wasn't interesting.  Oldman's character could have not been in the film, and it wouldn't have made it any worse, or any better.  He was just another oddity for us to look at.  A few cheap thrills in the place of substance is what 'Hannibal' really is.  Oh, and the infamous scene with Liotta at the end of the film, I have one thing to say.  It was either:a)absolutely brilliant black comedy that was supposed to have us laughing in some sort of shock, orb)gore done so horribly bad that it completely embodies the mediocrity of the movie...but I'll leave it up to you to decide.  Bottom line is this, Hopkins is still watchable.  Moore is a fine enough replacement.  The only thing the film is missing is substance, and its missing the dynamic relationship that propelled the first one forward and made it memorable. If you want to watch it, go ahead.  You really won't miss much if you don't.  6 out of 10.",Hannibal

The story brings us to Florence, where the beautiful city is in perfect contrast with the evil and admirable Lecter. It is the evil within the beauty. This also comes to sight in Lecter's 'Romeo & Juliet'-like relationship with Clarice Starling. Towards the end he asks her: ""Would ever say 'stop' If you love me, you'd stop?""; the beauty within the evil.The acting is superb, though Julianne Moore sometimes struggles with Jodie Foster's unfair legacy as Clarice Starling. Moore is not as strong on screen as Foster was, but what does it matter? The story is NOT about Clarice Starling, but about Hannibal Lecter; Clarice got her story told in 'Silence of the Lambs', and with 'Hannibal' we get a story about this fascination figure Hannibal Lecter. 'The Starling Story, part II' was never the intention (or the need). Hopkins is simply great! With such calmness, stylish taste of art, and sophisticated evil, he brings more life to the character than any actor could ever do. Gary Oldman is a great choice as the vengeful Mason Verger. He does a great job, and the character is even more evil than Hannibal himself.The score done by Hans Zimmer is frightening and disturbing when it has to be. But it's also beyond beautiful; it's filled with such emotion and sensibility, which will leave you almost crying, especially during the opera sequence  Again, the beauty against the beast.My only small catch with the film is a special scene towards the end. It is so sickening and gross but completes the terrifying picturing of Hannibal the Cannibal.'Hannibal' is a beautiful horror film. It should not be watched by the ones, who expect graphic violence, blood and more blood. Sure it has it scenes, but it's not the main focus.'Hannibal' is within no doubt one of the most underrated films of all time.

The locales are gorgeous and the camera work and use of shadows and framing is excellent.  But a feast for the eyes means that you're still hungry.After all the teasing between Hannibal and Starling in SOTL, I was expecting real sexual tension, unexpressed and potent, since he was now on the loose and since he's superhuman, could evade all maneuvers to capture him.  But when he is physically near her, the screen doesn't sizzle.  It's just *blah*.  One tiny kiss at the end and then he runs off, to presumably go into hiding in another exotic locale -- Tahiti, maybe?  Live it up as a modern day Gauguin?  It was just a very disappointing finale to a story which has been building up excitement for 10 years.The performances were good, although Hopkins has lost his edge as Hannibal. That's not surprising since he set the bar so high for himself in SOTL. Julianne Moore was OK as Starling, although I noticed that her accent tended to have varying degrees of Southern-ness, sometimes disappearing altogether. I thought Gary Oldman was the most lively character in the movie and his make-up was stunning.I gave it a 7 for the visual part and for Oldman, but maybe I'm being too kind.  I hope the prequel Red Dragon with Ed Norton lives up to SOTL in overall quality.",Hannibal
263,silviopellerani,"A waste of time, read the book should definitely be better",3,15 May 2001,"No, I can not approve this film with such a good actor as Anthony Hopkins and the rest of the cast including the good Italian ones: Francesca Neri and Giancarlo Giannini.Unfortunately the film is light years far away from the first excellent one: The Silence of Lambs. The thrilling effect has been substituted by a disgusting and vomiting brain eater scene and some other pigs ""corrida"" which brings the whole film to a very low level.It looks like this serial was mainly a commercial experiment without any real interest in trying to match the level of the previous one.Rating. 3/10",Hannibal
264,charlietuna,I expected more,6,13 February 2001,"Perhaps it is strange to go into a sequel with high expectations, but such is the seduction of the combination of Ridley Scott and David Mamet.  Much the same as when Jean-Pierre Juenet took over the helm of the Alien saga, this dynamic duo seemed just the ones to deliver a sequel on par with the original.  While they surely didn't fail to the degree of Juenet, ""Hannibal"" lacks the punch and suspense of Silence of the Lambs.  As usual, Scott's eye delivers a fine focus for the film.  The crowd shots were handled with his signature grace, the lighting always in step with the scene.  Some have quibbled about the graphic nature of several scenes, yet if they stopped to consider the story, they would have just taken another bite of popcorn. However, Mamet's adaptation of the Harris novel, was curious not only due to its deviation from what I felt was the book's more powerful conclusion, but being seduced into writing in the banal quips such as a passing couple stating ""Lets get something to eat"" to Hannibal's trite reply, ""Lets"".  I actually checked my watch as the movie struggled to make the transition out Italy.  Each scene painstakingly blocked to the point that editor Pietro Scalia dared not cut a shred of footage.  All in all, if we forget that this is the follow up to one of the best thrillers of the 1990s, that heavy weights Scott and Mamet were at the helm, you are left with a well acted film.  Anthony Hopkins has not lost a step in his reprisal of Lecter, Juilianne Moore makes the most of being in the unenviable position of replacing Foster and Gary Oldman delivers his signature ghoul performance as Mason Verger.  Marred only by another lack luster performance by Ray Liotta (who has never lived up the promise shown in ""Goodfellas""), the cast delivers.  However, strong acting seldom makes up for a turgid screen play and poor editing and it fails here as well.  There is no reason to give MGM theater prices for the privilege of seeing this on the big screen.  Hannibal is little more than a Friday night rental when your too tired to get off the couch.",Hannibal
265,johnmichael-2,Preposterous Fun,7,8 April 2007,"I had huge expectations for ""Silence of the Lambs"", and while it was good, I was a bit disappointed. Having heard lots of bad stuff about this movie, I had low expectation, but they were met, if not surpassed.This movie has a lot going for it. Great directing by Ridley Scott. Anthony Hopkins, as always, does some great acting. And, while Jodie Foster has been replaced, Julianne Moore did such a wonderful job as Agent Starling that I hardly cared (which is saying a LOT, because Jodie Foster was an amazing actress). Just as she did with ""The Forgotten"", Moore's acting and screen presence greatly enhanced the movie and made it much more enjoyable to watch. Also worth mentioning are the special effects and the art direction, and even the cinematography. All of it was quite a joy to watch, and Ridley Scott held it wonderfully together. Even the really gory scenes didn't seem too pretentiously graphic.Now for the major goof--the script. Gosh, I don't know what happened to it. It starts like any other crime movie--a good deal of action and lots of affected little mysteries and conversation-stuff. Oh, and there's the amusing scene where Pazzi hacks his way onto the FBI top 10 list by typing in a secret password; what really makes it funny is that anyone can visit this site--I found a link inside an online parody of this movie.Then there was the ending. There was some point in the last half-hour where things went off the deep end. As the aforementioned parody put it: ""THE FAINTLY PLAUSIBLE PART OF THE MOVIE: *ends here*"" or something to that effect. I won't spoil the ridiculous scene near the end, but you'll know which scene I'm talking about. It's so ludicrous it's funny. I wonder how in the world the screenwriters came up with something so randomly, preposterously stupid.The final verdict: ridiculous, a bit inflated, but all great fun. If the screenwriters had stepped up their act, this movie could have been blown-away-amazing. Sadly, this is not the case. So keep your expectations low and have a good, mindless time.",Hannibal
266,ShinKyo81,Where the heck is Jodie Foster?!,5,25 February 2001,"I heard from the critics that ""Hannibal"" was a boring film that didn't reach the level of the first part, ""The Silence of the lambs"". In my opinion, they are two very different films. You have to think that in 10 years the film industry have evolved a lot. I don't know if it has evolved to better or worse, but I think ""Hannibal"" is better than lots of productions with enormous budgets.The points that I would like to remark from the film are:Brilliant performance of Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore as Dr. Lecter and Clarice Starling, even though the character of the Special Agent was better performed by Jodie Foster. I would say it's a pity not having Jodie Foster in the film, 'cause the connection between Hopkins and Foster was unbelievable. Also a mention for Gary Oldman as the 4th Lecter's Victim.Excellent photography and camera plans in all the movie. When the film occurs in Florence, you can feel the charm of the city (I almost thought that some settings were taken from ""Gladiator"" ^_^). Ridley Scott, always surprising the audience with innovations in the 7th art.EXTREME SPOILER AHEAD. DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM. BEEN WARNED :) Scroll down to the ending if you don't want to read the spoiler.But one bad point in the film is the end scene. I mean, a film that has got style and is a bit slow in several moments, can't end in that way, with this crude scene of cannibalism. In my opinion that's one of the most grotesque scenes I've never seen before. Lots of people will say that is impossible to live with the head opened and with the brain out, but it is possible. As Dr. Lecter says: ""the brain itself doesn't feel pain"". A brilliant doctor indeed.Anyway, ""Hannibal"" is a very good film. One of the most awaited films is now in the theaters. Is it as good as expected? I don't know. I just say that Ridley Scott, Anthony Hopkins and the rest of the crew have created a masterpiece that will be remembered in time. At least Hannibal Lecter hasn't got any evidence of spongiform encephalopathy for eating brain :) Go and see it, worth look! 7/10",Hannibal
267,Oggz,Useless comment no. 1249,8,16 December 2006,"Over a thousand mostly useless and uninsightful comments, that must be some controversy. Bombastic anger, disgust and illiteracy. Reimbursement demands, screams of betrayal, and slagging off more or less all involved, starting with Hopkins and his alleged wages down to the last tea lady on set. No small wonder though, given what expectations ""Hannibal"" had to live up to, Thomas Harris' excellent and multilayered prose notwithstanding - the last in the Hannibal trilogy of books is by far the most intricate, mystical and revealing, maintaining the entertainment factor of its predecessors but adding a lot more food for thought than either ""Red Dragon"" or ""Silence"". Read the book, patiently - it's the real McCoy. To stick to the original - and quite radical - ending should have been an imperative, and this is my only (and serious) complaint regarding the film version.Which, it must be said, manages to hold it together, more or less, all of the usual Hollywood ailments in place - it isn't exceedingly better of worse than ""Silence"", which had certain problems of it's own. ""Hannibal"" is more stylish, decadent and moodier of the two, beautifully photographed and quite indulging in terms of artistic expression, most notably editing which is superb. Furthermore, the piercing emotion and controlled, spartan passion of Patrick Cassidy's ""Vide Cor Meum"" musical extract is applied to great effect, putting to shame Hans Zimmer's sub-Mahlerian score that accompanies the bulk of the film's running time. Hopkins and Moore are adequate but both directed to project a certain amount of aloofness (I would have loved to see Foster again, simply for continuity reasons) - whereas Oldman is substandard in the face of an easy money job, his character reduced to shreds (quite literally!) - compared to the original portrayal in Harris' novel. In the film, his loathsomeness is merely visual. That said, my feeling is that the movie would have worked better had it lasted three hours instead of two - the sheer volume and important aspects of the novel would have been more comfortably accommodated that way, and we would have had a profounder film. Besides, Italians should speak Italian, at least amongst themselves - and those passages should have been subtitled. That would have added to the artistic, slightly ""European"" feel the film flirts with - is that so much to ask? Remarks have been made about bad English accents by the Italian actors - well, Hopkins' own short venture into Italian declamation called by the script sounds no better, frankly.Whilst by no means outstanding, ""Hannibal"" is definitely undeserving of the wrath of the outraged average cinema Joe, and certainly not from the ""moral"" viewpoint. There are far worse and scarier films around - just look at other movie franchises, the genuinely terrifying Austin Powers or Bridget Jones films.",Hannibal
268,diztorted,goody goody,8,28 April 2001,"Elegantly violent, sadistic and yet tasteful. What else could you have expected from the good old Dr. Hannibal Lecter? A person whose world is even more mysterious than the man himself. A character so unique it is impossible not to have him in mind once you had the pleasure to meet him, and of course not being the dinner that same night. Dr. Lecter is a man who really enjoys life on his own way without asking anyone anything, and believe you me, it is a very unique way!. Wouldn't you love to have a coffee with him?And on the other hand there is Clarice Starling, oh yes Clarice!!!. The long lost love of Lecter. The only person who could ever stand before Lecter and survive; the antagonist that was able to trick Lecter and won his admiration for it. If there was a person in this world worthy of Lecter affection that is Clarice. Starling understands Lecter and appreciates what he does, but she lives in a world she promised to take care of even though she doesn't feel like she belongs here. So, how could Lecter not get excited when he found Clarice Starling was back on the case?, to proof himself he was still capable of get away from it from the only person he admires/loves. To face again the one person who is capable of bringing him down.Hannibal is a film in which the struggle between good and evil resides in the eyes of the same person, Lecter himself. He is not bad, he is not good either...he is just HIM!!. A character who can kill you or save you depending of your role in this world. Ask yourself...did Lecter kill an innocent man during the film or at the first two films? Of course not, in that sense Lecter is like a punishment from God trying to erase the bad element. A different person trapped in a world hidden in hypocrisy and who would like to be like him but can't. And who is to play Lecter better than Anthony Hopkins? Hopkins did a marvelous job, elegant, cynical (which I loved the most), and even romantic.Love kill the demons,but...Do these persons really love each other or it's just a matter of fight between good and evil?To tell you the truth, as opposite from many people I know, I've never been a fan of SOTL. What attracted to me about this film was the fact that Ridley Scott directed it as I've always been a fan of his work (except G.I.Jane). And the truth is, I love this film much more than I do the first one. Saying this, ""Tata"" see you round for the next piece of mind!!!.",Hannibal
269,jmoney-2,"This sequel is much more of a dark comedy, it's somewhat disappointing to see Lecter turned into a comic book character.",5,4 March 2001,"When you think Hannibal Lecter, the menu that usually comes to mind is liver, fava beans and a nice chianti. But after seeing Hannibal, the B-grade follow-up to 1991 Best Picture-winner, The Silence of the Lambs, the only foods that came to mind were ham and cheese, as in, ""what hammy performances"" and ""what a cheesy film."" Where Lambs was a disturbing, gritty, realistic exploration of the criminally insane mind, this sequel is much more of a dark comedy. Instead of despising Lecter, we're made to despise his victims. Lecter, while still menacing, has become like Godzilla; as he eats everything in sight, we actually root for him. The plot inches along as it little-by-little works-up to the movie's main showdown between Lecter, and Mason Verger (Gary Oldman under a ton of make-up), a millionaire pedophile who lost his face, and the use of his legs, in one of Lecter's attacks. Verger is truly difficult to look at, but that doesn't stop Scott from giving us lots of long, lingering close-ups.In the last act, it only gets worse -- nearly everything is played for sadistic laughs and, as Starling helps save Lecter from the diabolical revenge plans of Verger, his only surviving victim, the movie resembles nothing more than one of those odd-couple, buddy-action pictures: ""She's a tough-but-vulnerable FBI Agent, he's a serial killer; together, they're fighting crime!"" The main attraction, Anthony Hopkins, doesn't disappoint. He has a lot of fun with his unleashed Lecter. Julianne Moore does a passable job as Starling. Jodie Foster's absence is hardly noticed, mainly because the script doesn't give Agent Starling very much to do -- when she's not running around with a gun, she's just sitting in a Fox Mulder-ish basement office watching and listening to tapes of Lecter. Don't get me wrong, ""Hannibal"" is decent entertainment, especially for those who enjoy twisted humor. But after two serious films (""Hannibal"" is actually the third in the series following ""Lambs"" and 1986's underrated ""Manhunter""), it's somewhat disappointing to see Lecter turned into a comic book character.",Hannibal

Giancarlo Giannini was a great actor, and i must admit that he's now one of my favorite actors. Giancarlo Giannini was awesome.

271,Castor-5,Great great film,10,17 February 2001,"It's surprising to see so many poor reviews of this film, I'd think the average IMDb reader/writer would know better than to expect a ""sequel"" to Silence of the Lambs (it takes place 10 years from those events people!!). Lets not also forget that this film is call 'Hannibal' not 'Clarice"" so obviously HANNIBAL IS GOING TO BE THE MAIN CHARACTER.  If you want to compare it to Silence of the Lambs understand first that this is not a pyschological thriller, nor a race against time thriller, nor a character study, in fact other than Anthony Hopkins and a few other minor simularities Hannibal is a film all on it's own.  Ridley Scott was very smart and making it as far different from Silence of the Lambs as possible so *cough cough* morons wouldn't keep on comparing it to Silence of the Lambs but a film completely different.  The characters have changed over the decade, just like we all do; so don't expect Clarice to be doing the same things as she did in Silence and don't expect Hannibal to still be sitting behind bars. This is a devilishly good film and those of you who won't accept it because of it's change of pace nor read the Thomas Harris novel that came out a year ago (Hah!  And you call yourselves Silence of the Lambs fans!) than perhaps you should stay away from this one.  For those that want to have a good time at a great movie, from a great director, with great acting, and great cinematography will have a blast with this.  9/10",Hannibal
272,Ellie-23,Worth the $7.50 to see it on the BIG screen.,9,14 February 2001,Since I read the book way back I knew some of what to expect.  I didn't go the whole 10 because I felt they left out some of the more facinating angles about Mr. Lechter which softened his violent demeaner.  I wish Jodi Foster had agreed to do the film but Julianne Moore was very believable.  She did not seem quite as innocent as Foster.  In fact in an attempt to make her look more innocent they only succeded in making her look spacey at times.,Hannibal
273,hprill,Not as bad as I expected,7,16 September 2001,"I was truly positively surprised by this movie. I thought that the book was particularly bad, little more than an enumeration of shock scenes and cheap thrill effects with very little plot. I found the book particularly disappointing in lots of longish chapters that were nothing but red herrings, I thought it was a bad idea to reveal the cause of Hannibal Lecter's madness and I particularly didn't like the book's ending.That said, I think David Mamet and Steve Zaillian did a good job at rewriting this flawed novel into a solid, albeit not excellent, thriller. I don't blame them, the base material was simply not good enough for being filmed.Contrary to the novel, there is actually a plot, which is not vying for spectacular moments, but develops rather slowly and gradually. Even though this may at some point seem to make the movie appear a bit longish, I think the pace is adequate and well-balanced.(minor spoilers follow) The only thing I missed was Mason Verger's sister; without her, his death seems somewhat contrived; there seems little motivation behind it. The good thing was that Mamet/Zaillian also got rid of Lecter's past and significantly changed the ending, and I prefer this ending very much to that of the novel, which never rang true to me.So the script was good, what about the acting? Anthony Hopkins's Hannibal Lecter reprise lacks some of the demonic darkness of ""Silence of the Lambs"". Since ""Silence"", Lecter-like characters have become so much of a stereotype that even the original hardly rings true. Julianne Moore as the older, more experienced Agent Starling lacks Jodie Foster's vulnerability; that is understandable given the 10 years that have supposedly passed, but then it was exactly Starling's lack of experience and her vulnerability that made her such an interesting character. So despite a solid performance from Julianne Moore she simply is no match for Jodie Foster. Gary Oldman as Mason Verger is barely recognizable between layers of mask, and nowhere near as evil and mentally disturbed as the character in the novel. With his elaborate make-up he has little opportunity to act or emote, which is a pity.As for the rest of the cast... well, unremarkable.I give this 7 points, mostly for a well-done script by Mamet/Zaillian, who turned a bad novel into a film that made some sense and for solid, but not exceptional directing by Ridley Scott. To come close to ""Silence of the Lambs"", Thomas Harris should have written a better novel than ""Hannibal"".",Hannibal

It's beautiful the way he mixes words like `okedoke' into his intense psychotic moments of terror.  Gary Oldham was awesome in his supporting role!  It doesn't matter whether you liked it or not, this flick DID affect everyone watching..and that's all I believe a suspense movie's goal SHOULD BE!  B",Hannibal
275,tohu,Hannibal,9,22 May 2006,"I like this film a lot, but of course it suffers - as all sequels do - by comparison to its predecessor, in this case 'Silence of the Lambs' The main reason for having a sequel at all was to showcase again the character of Hannibal Lecter, a monstrous creation everyone wanted to see more of after the first film. It could have bombed badly therefore if writer and actor had let us down by failing to catch the magic again. It was after all a decade after the original was made. But they don't, and Anthony Hopkins turns in another delicious performance as the man with the evil intent cloaked in inestimable, menacing charm.Julianne Moore drew the short straw in having to re-create the Clarice Starling role that had been so memorably played by another actress. She does well in my opinion, but inevitably we keep thinking 'where is Jodie Foster?', and this lends her portrayal a lack of credibility which is entirely unfair. Gary Oldman's Mason Verger is suitably loathsome and manages to make Lecter seem almost like the hero in their battle of wits. If there is a weak link, Ray Liotta's Krendler seems a bit misplaced.The direction deserves special mention. The lush, beautiful settings are mocked by the horror of what is happening in them and the perfectly-selected atmospheric music stayed in my mind long after the film had ended.Once again, the film lacks realism, but as with the original, it doesn't matter. Of course things like this don't really happen - but so what? It's a film. Get over it! I was prompted after seeing it to read the books, and the right decision was made in changing the ending of this story from that written by Thomas Harris. We were subsequently treated to another look at Lecter in a decent prequel movie, 'Red Dragon,' but I will not be alone in hoping that some day we will see yet more of him in a further instalment. Unlikely I suspect - but not impossible.",Hannibal
276,nmp381,Enjoyed it alot,7,3 July 2001,"I honestly didn't think Hannibal would be any good, considering it had to follow the footsteps of a very good first movie. It definitely exceeded my expectations and is the best horror movie i've seen for at least the last few years. The acting is very strong. As usual Hopkins performance of Lecter was great. Moore as Clarice Sterling was surprisingly VERY good. There was also great directing and scenery.
The movie has a relatively slow pace. In this one, Lecter has escaped to Italy. Meanwhile there is a diabolicle disfigured man who is out to get Lecter for leaving him in his current disfigured self. Detective Sterling gets involved in the case, and another cat and mouse game  with Lecter ensues for a second time.
There are some flaws to the movie. Too much emphasis on gore and rather abrupt ending, but overall the feeling of adrenaline between Lecter and Sterling is still there. On par with the original.",Hannibal

Seriously, the best part of this turdy exercise is Gary Oldman's mask. The best parts of the book - which is crazy by the way - were left out or omitted and we're left with the shallow content, wooden Julianne Moore (girl, what were you thinking) and Ray Liotta who does the best job and has the best dinner scene of them all.

However, in Hannibal, the driving force was nauseating, pointless gore. I'd be lying if I didn't admit that Silence was a bit gross as well. However, it all seemed to have relevance to the movie.  In Hannibal, the producers seemed solely interested in disgusting their audience.

280,DylansFearFiles,Hannibal Lecter Has Returned,9,13 January 2009,"Thomas Harris is a great author, just as Ridley Scott (The Gladiator) is a great director. Hannibal is fantastic. Another great entry into the story of Hannibal Lecter.Ridley Scott's ""Hannibal"" is ten years after ""Silence of the Lambs"", we see a fugitive Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) in Florence, Italy, hiding under the name of ""Dr. Fell"". He is in what he describes as ""retirement"". Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore) has been disgraced for shooting a criminal while she is carrying her child, she soon gets called back on the Lecter case when a disfigured millionaire and survivor of Dr. Lecter's murder spree, Mason Verger (Gary Oldman), claims to have new information on Hannibal Lector but is also plotting for revenge. Dr. Lecter returns to America to ""return to public life"", see Starling and survive the vindictive Mason Verger's plan for revenge.I understand the mixed reviews but I disagree with the negatives. ""Hannibal"" was a well acted film but I have to say that I was disappointed with the ending. Julianne Moore (The Forgotten) did well but I liked Jodie Foster better in the role. Ray Liotta (Goodfellas) is good in the role of Paul Krendler and Anthony Hopkins (The Silence of the Lambs) has not lost the ability to give you a feeling of terror while playing the cannibalistic psychiatrist. Fans should not be disappointed.9/10",Hannibal
281,simondclinch-1,Unmissable,10,8 June 2014,"For me it beggar's belief that the average rating is less than 7. It seems most viewers preferred Silence of The Lambs. Certainly Silence has more scary moments and qualifies as horror as well as crime. But Hannibal is something very different. The characters are far more well-developed throughout. In fact Hannibal has a rich mix of characters whereas Silence by comparison just runs through the plot. Hannibal is also more beautiful, taking place in Italy as well as the U.S. Before Hannibal was filmed, I was reading the book and imagining what film music would best fit. In particular the need for classical music to match some of the Italian scenery. And when the film finally appeared, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the score more than lived up to my expectations. There is also dark humour here which was definitely to my taste. (Naughty me!)In regard to the changed ending, presumably in response to criticism of the book, I think the ending shouldn't have been changed and Clarice and Hannibal should indeed have sailed off into the sunset. This might offend the idealists, but idealism becomes dangerous if followed too fanatically. Allowing characters unpredictability is in fact essential to their credibility.",Hannibal

It's a more leisurely affair, but the relationship between Clarice and Hannibal is well extended, and the monster somehow even grows on us. The sequences set in Florence are very elegant, too. It all falls apart a little near the end, however, with the gratuitously harrowing comeuppance of one of the villains which touches on the absurd and breaks the spell. Fun, then, but flawed.",Hannibal
283,john_oneill41,Mixed Feelings about this,6,13 February 2007,"It took ten years but Anthony Hopkins finally came back to the role he said he would never play again. But was it worth it? Well, yes and no.I confess that the only Lecter book I have read is The Silence of the Lambs and that was many years ago. Having not read Hannibal, I cannot really say how the film compares to the book, but the story in the film at least has a kind of ""So what?"" feel to it. With the exceptions of Verger and Krendler, all characters are pretty much back where they started by the end and no one's really achieved very much.In addition, although Julianne Moore is a capable actress, for me anyway Jodie Foster is Clarice Starling. Since Ms Foster didn't do it, they had to replace her with someone else but it just wasn't the same.All that's not to say I didn't enjoy the film because I did. Any movie by Ridley Scott's going to be well directed and there are a lot of positives also. Gary Oldman makes a very effective bad guy and the idea of breeding man eating pigs was extremely twisted and macabre. Anthony Hopkins was perfect as Hannibal, this time around giving a good insight into what kind of man Hannibal would have been, if those events in his youth had't turned him into a killer. Having said all that, He also delivers the goods as it were, with the killing of Pazzi and the live lobotomy of Paul Krendler.Overall I enjoyed it, although I feel the story needs to be told more and we need another chapter in the Hannibal saga (other than the prequel Hannibal Rising).",Hannibal
284,fofml,Worth the hype,9,2 March 2001,"There are so many movies out there that get a lot of hype but are really unworthy of it. When I went to see Hannibal I was hoping that this movie would be worth the hype and I was very glad to find out it is. It's a thrilling psychological movie with great settings (who wouldn't wanna see Florence after this one?), a great screenplay and of course a gorgeous cast. Anthony Hopkins is really really great when he repeats his role of Dr. Lecter in this one. Julianne Moore had the more-than-tough task to replace the talented Jodie Foster but she really is sensational and was the best choice. Gary Oldman did a great job, too, just like Ray Liotta (his last scene in this movie, is, well..let's just say people won't forget it soon).

Oh, and for the record it isn't really all that gory so don't worry if you're a bit squeamish, there are only a couple of short sequences (plus a rather longer one at the end) that might turn your stomach but for the most part it's blood-free.",Hannibal

The Silence Of The Lambs already showed us everything. The characters that are Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling, the great performances of Foster and Hopkins and... Buffalo Bill. Hannibal didn't manage to give us a story in the same level or higher than the Silence's. Hannibal is very less frightening than he truly is in the first movie. (Actually, the first one is Manhunter, but I'm talking about those which have Hopkins in the cast). And Starling, now played by Julianne Moore is also less intriguing.I love the Ridley Scott movies, I won't deny this. But this is one of his few disappointing works. In Hannibal there isn't much character development, instead, the movie takes too much time on characters trying to find clues about where they can find Lecter. Moore listens to past recorded conversations with Lecter in headphones, a cop, played by Giancarlo Giannini, sits in front of his computer, believing that he has already met Lecter in person. And there are other secondary characters, partners of Giancarlo, who do whatever must be done in order to catch Lecter. And, also, there is a guy named Mason Verger, played by Gary Oldman.The movie, itself, is based on a plot where Verger wants Lecter captured in order to torture him, like he never could believe, because of a personal vendetta. This is a good story, but no match to the silence of the lambs. I wasn't too shocked either about the brain scene. For me, at most of times, what really counts for a scene to be shocking, is that there must be suffering. When Liotta has his head cut open and eats his own brain, there's no suffering at all, only gore. This might be nasty and shocking too, but not as shocking as Catherine Martin trying to climb that well, screaming desperately, or Marvin Nash, the tortured cop in Reservoir Dogs, when he's groaning like hell.Hannibal is a nice movie to watch, not a bad sequel at all. Its only problem might have been that it simply is a sequel to one of the most successful movies ever made, a best picture motion picture, and it's hard to get to the same level, but it's worth watching it, anyway.",Hannibal
287,CarpenterKen,"As expected, 3rd best of 3 Harris book films",7,9 February 2001,"After reading Thomas Harris' book ""Hannibal,"" I was pretty confident that the eventual film made from it would fall into third place behind ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Manhunter"" in the Hannibal Lechter trilogy.I was correct.While director Ridley Scott tried hard, I'd say he and the studio wasted their money by bringing in David Mamet as a co-screenwriter. There is simply not enough stirring dialogue here to overcome the sometimes-silly plot twists.As for Julianne Moore's performance as Clarice Starling, let's just say it comes off as drug induced long before Anthony Hopkins' Lechter gets his hypodermic in her. Jodie Foster knew what she was doing when she passed on this sequel.I give it a 7, mainly for the fabulous scenery of Florence, Washington and North Carolina.(If you haven't read ""The Red Dragon"" or seen the film made from it, ""Manhunter,"" make a point to do both BEFORE you see ""Hannibal."")",Hannibal

290,Lunchbox-8,Bit off more than they can chew!,9,10 February 2001,"Hannibal was good despite it's severe critical bashing.  After the painful ten year anticipation for the Silence of the Lambs sequel, was I actually possible for the movie to be as good as we expected and wanted?  It was good though.  There was still the morbid and disturbing but eerily interesting material like in The Silence of the Lambs.  The plot though was totally different.  Instead of an FBI hunt to catch a serial killer like in the film's two predeseccors, it was rather long and incredulous and seemed to be more than you could handle in one movie.  There was too much information in the book that couldn't be all put into one film (Hence the one line summary `Bit off more than they can chew' which may have initially seemed to make no sense and just be a cheap pun (which it initially was)).  Another big problem was the odd directing style which seems common with Ridley Scott. It seemed like footage you might see in a cheap contemporary Sci-Fi movie. It wasn't an artistic look into the mind of both a brilliant and evil killer and a forensic FBI search for a frightening new serial killer. 
  Nevertheless, Hannibal was good.  I enjoyed the use of classical music as the main score.  I enjoyed the way that the movie showed how Hannibal Lecter lived without being imprisoned.  How he wasn't just a savage, disgusting villain, but a refined, savage, disgusting villain.  In a nutshell: I don't know how they could put an actual film into a nutshell, it's just too big, I mean gimme a break.  IN A NUTSHELL!!!: it was good but didn't stand up to my or other peoples' excessively high expectations.",Hannibal
291,sam_3,"If you still haven't eaten your brain, you will no doubt learn from this!",8,20 December 2001,"We have been warned from the beginning that this film was not a simple follow-up sequel to ""The Silence of the Lamb (SOTL)"". This was most apparent when we learned that both Jonathan Demme and Jodie Foster backed off from the project. And YET, alas it is very unfortunate that many reviewers and viewers disappoint themselves by comparing the two in an unfair manner.In a sense, SOTL was a derivation from the main plot in that Dr. Lecter has somewhat been set aside, while a new character FBI agent Clarice Starling came to the fore. She attracted attention and awards alight (and rightfully so), but we must bare in mind, the story is about Hannibal, the man-eater. We come back to the gore of human nature in ""Hannibal"". We, as humans, may seek sophistication, and we may achieve. We achieve intelligence, cultural nourishment, physical excellence, depth of insight. And yet, we can still be that gory man- eater. That is why we can't condemn Dr. Lecter, and at the end let go of him. Alas, we even allow him to kiss us. SOTL didn't achieve this much of powerful portrait of humanity. It was after all, a blockbuster film (and a brilliant one, I must add). ""Hannibal"" had the last say.Although it is not my custom to comment on acting, I must make a note about Julianne Moore. She was brilliant. She was so focused on being Clarice Starling, the ambitious and capable FBI agent, also matured ten years on since the previous case. I thought there was no one but Jodie Foster who could handle Clarice in ""Hannibal"". I was dead wrong (good thing I don't usually comment on acting). Julianne Moore did not try to create her own version of Clarice, nor did she try to ""compete"" against Jodie Foster. If JF had achieved recognition, I would say it is only fair that JM should receive the same. After 15 minutes of viewing the film, I found myself saying, ""Who cares who's acting as Clarice, she IS Clarice."" I am still puzzled as to why JF declined from the role, though...I would have thought this was just the kind of film JF would love to have jumped on to.When you view this film, you are looking into your true self, only if you are ready to admit. The film may not achieve the glamor of SOTL, how unfortunate. The gruesome scenes attracted too much attention and criticism. But mind you, the scenery in Italy and the music, oh they were beautiful! I shall strongly recommend that you sit back and view this one (although I do not recommend having snacks during the film...).And if you still haven't eaten your brain, you will no doubt learn from this!",Hannibal

The acting was great (you can't go wrong with Anthony Hopkins, Julianne Moore, Ray Liotta, Giancarlo Giannini, and Gary Oldman), the settings are incredible (especially Florence, Italy), and the direction is brilliant!

I can't believe David Mamet and Ridley Scott's name appear on this travesty. The best career move Jody Foster ever made was turning this one down. Julianne Moore was as emotionless throughout as a female Keanu Reeves. Gary Oldman was of course, his brilliant self. He is a crippled victim of Hannibal and the make-up is so good, I didn't know it was Gary until the final credits. but eaten by trained boars??? Give me a break! Rumor has it that he didn't want his name even mentioned in the credits. And frying and feeding his own brain to Ray Liotta...I was laughing at the absurdity, no make that stupidity of this flick at this point.

295,zippyflynn2,A Typical Hollywood Serial Killing,5,12 April 2007,"Yup, they did it again. Between the sanitized ending: agent Starling became a cannibal in the book but is an unconvincing righteous crusader in this turkey (an essential and main theme the author uses throughout his books is what makes a truly great detective is their ability to think and be somewhat of the same cloth as those they hunt) and the miscast Julianne Moore who really stinks up the scenes with her phony flat floundering; Hollywood has killed another serial. Sir Anthony gives a fine performance with the flawed material he was given and Gary Oldman and Ray Liotta and some others are all excellent but they cannot keep this vessel from missing the mark completely. Once again the Hollywood execs involved with this have kept their jobs by hiring all the ""right"" people, so even if it had bombed at the box office they could claim they were not responsible because they hired all the ""right"" people. Unfortunately not enough of them were the right ones for this specific job. Besides one of the essential leads being a terrible and inappropriate choice, Ms. Moore, the integral story changes were idiotically formulaic, essentially burning all the bridges for thought the author had built and that had been kept intact in ""The Silence of the Lambs"" movie. Did Mamet REALLY write this? Or is he just the writer of record and it was destroyed by too many cooks (other writers) fooling around with the recipe? Why does Hollywood always do this? If a theme is ""too dark"" or ""too depressing"" do a different film for chrissake. Don't destroy the heart of something to make it more palatable for the bland masses. Hey I have an idea, instead of Dr. Lecter being a serial killer let him be a man who likes to eat lots of CEREAL. Yeah, that way you can make this into a cartoon for kids on Saturday morning too! Think of the marketing possibilities, tying it in with Cheerios or how about LIFE cereal? Wow, maybe the studio execs missed their chance to REALLY cash in. Shhhh, very quietly now, don't repeat this, otherwise the remake they do because they're all too cowardly to try a real new theme but instead rehash proved ""box office"" that they ""rewrite"" for the masses will be worse than what I just said.",Hannibal
296,motta80-2,You'll say Jodie who? as your take your first bite of Hannibal,10,6 February 2001,"While hard to compare to its predecessor (Silence of the Lambs was a true masterpiece) the reintroduction of Hannibal Lecter, M.D. has truly been worth the 10 year wait.The film strikes a very different tone from the outset, and this is down largely to director Ridley Scott. He and Sir Anthony Hopkins are having fun with this character and Hannibal (film and character) is very funny, albeit with a dark slightly twisted sense of humour. Hannibal is, essentially, the hero here and you like him and route for him to the end (which is quite different from the book.)I will not go into plot as most people have probably read the book and saying more could only work to spoil the enjoyment so I will now just tackle the actors and production. Needless to say the film looks spectacular. The Florentine sets are breathtaking, but what else would you expect from the director of Blade Runner, Gladiator and Thelma & Louise - we know Ridley Scott can deliver the visuals.As for the actors, Hopkins delivers the goods as we have come to expect from him. But here he is having a blast with a character he clearly enjoys inhabiting and he is rarely more powerful and commanding a presence than he is in this film and Lambs.An unrecognisable Gary Oldman (and uncredited it the opening titles and on posters) holds his own as subvillain Mason Verger, Lecter's only surviving victim and the flashback of his mutilation is well handled. The film does provide plenty of gory surprises.As for the key question, what of Julianne Moore? We all know how good an actress she is (Magnolia, Short Cuts, Boogie Nights) but can she fill Jodie Foster's Oscar winning shoes? The answer is yes! You will not give Foster a second thought in this film as Moore is Clarice Starling from the moment she appears. She is not trying to be Jodie Foster, she IS Clarice Starling. Hannibal is more a cat and mouse chase than the one-to-one Silence of the Lambs and it is difficult to imagine Foster playing this side of the character. That is the key, showing a different side to the character gives Moore something to work with more substantial than just being Jodie Foster. Personally I love both actresses but I wouldn't want Foster in this role (having seen it) if you paid me. This is Moore's part and she equips herself well.See this film, marvel and then see it again. It may not quite be the masterpiece of Silence of the Lambs but it's close and it's a lot more entertaining. You'll laugh, you'll sit on the edge of your seat, you'll say ""now that's just plain sick!""Enjoy!",Hannibal

After making a titan like SOTL,the next insert should have been much better than this attempt. Seemed as though it went more for visual shock as opposed to psychological thrills like in the first one. Plot holes annoyed me as well.

298,cwillis_m,Better than I expected,8,12 January 2002,"When I heard how gruesome this film of supposed to be, I hadn't figured it would be very good. The Silence of the Lambs was so great because it was not a graphic film, it only showed the results of the violence rather than the violent acts themselves (for the most part). Hannibal is a much more graphic film than Silence of the Lambs, but under the direction of Ridley Scott, it comes off very nicely. So it's not Silence of the Lambs, but how many films can be compared to that original terror masterpiece? My rating for Hannibal: 8/10",Hannibal
299,blubb06,Full of symbolism like a dark dream,9,11 August 2009,"Yes, it's disgusting, and Jodie Foster isn't in it. But apart from that, this is a very good movie.Obstacle n°1 that kept me from appreciating it the first time around is -- yes, Julianne Moore brings a classical beauty (sort of) and her own kind of moral strength to the 'Starling' role. This time it's supercooled woman, not snotty-nosed little girl against the beast. Of the two, the rookie was more likable. In the Lecter-Starling tapes that were re-recorded with Moore, she sounds super-self-controlled -- all reflections on that earlier, more vulnerable self are gone. Pity, because it could have reflected how Starling has changed, and added depth to her character. But hers is not the starring role, anyway -- Mason Verger and the city of Florence outshine, or rather out-darken everything else, including the famous Dr Lecter, M.D. I only would have wished this great villain a better death.Where 'Silence of the Lambs' was unnerving, 'Hannibal' is really straining to the point of nausea. It's not a movie one can easily fall in love with, because it's de-romanticizing the idol Lecter and putting him in the same club as Jeffrey Dahmer. No wonder some people find it disappointing. But get away from Lecter-worship and the image of Jodie-who, forget Thomas Harris's novel, and you'll not be bored. You'll still need a strong stomach, though.",Hannibal

Not only boom mikes but also the screenplay ,soul of movies,is full of boring,insignificant and free dangerus violence. I consider again Michael Mann's MANHUNTER the first and best movie of Harris Trilogy about Dr Lecter and that must be a model for any sequels,Demme with the Silence been close to the same quality but that trash named Hannibal is far light year for be consider a classic.I advice  Mr.Scott to take any times of pause and reflection,not always shooting using different times of frames can be the solution for win academy awards.",Hannibal
301,SanderStrijbos,Better than I expected,8,22 February 2001,"I saw it yesterday and I must say it's a great movie, but it has its flaws. One of the best thing the makers did was changing style. Instead of going on on the Silence...- style, they've decided to go in a total different direction. And with good results. Otherwise it would be simple rip off, but (although other people don't think so) it's not!Anthony Hopkins is back as Hannibal Lecter and he's great! Julianne Moore is a very good replacement for Jodie Foster (if not the best!).Now the flaws: There were a few plot holes I did notice. How van Hannibal travel in and out of the US without being noticed by the cops on the airports. He looks the same as in Silence... and since he's on the list of FBI'S ten most wanted it's very unlikely he can travel like he does in the film. Maybe it was interesting to see how Hannibal passed customs.Another flaw: Mason Verger lies in bed and tells the voice controlled telephone to call Carlo. Carlo takes the call in a telephone booth!By the way, wouldn't it be better if the filmmakers showed us how much Mason Vergers doctor hates Verger. It would explain a lot in the ending of the film.Like I said it's a very good movie despite its plotholes. It could have been a 'darker' film and if there ever will be a sequel, dear producers, please consider David Fincher as the director. Ridley Scott did a terrific job on this one (but he was better on Gladiator), but I think Fincher could make a Lecter- movie much darker.I rate this one a 8 (out of 10)",Hannibal
302,DaveZ,an improvement on the book,8,11 February 2001,"I was not particularly fond of this book when it came out.  The style and plotting seemed inferior to Silence of the Lambs (which was a great improvement over Red Dragon), and the ending went against everything we knew and liked about the character of Clarice Starling.The film is more successful.  The story is streamlined, with characters and subplots jettisoned.  Most importantly, the ending is changed, preserving the understanding of Clarice that had been established not only in the previous book, but also, earlier in the current book.  Unfortunately, the streamlining eliminates most of the clues to characters' motives, and some of the subtleties of the story.The gore factor in the film is not as high as I had been led to believe, but there is certainly plenty of blood and violence to go around.  Consistent with the title, Hannibal himself is the predominant character by far, with even Clarice relegated to supporting status.",Hannibal
303,Eelco_1977,A huge disappointment!!!!!!,7,23 February 2001,"Before I went to this movie, I read a lot of reviews and even led myself be advised what to do. I really had high doubts about this sequal and I must say they were very right! Let me first put forward the good things about the film: 1) I have to admit, the black humor was very ok! 2) How the film was shot. 3) Anthony Hopkins' acting. 4) The death of Pazzi! The things I really hated about the film (in a random order): 1) It was never really scary. The only thing I did find horrible was when Mason Verger and some other guy were eaten by pigs (I don't know what you call them in English). 2) The acting of the other actors and actresses was absolutely horrible! 3) Mason Verger's make-up was very badly done (overdone actually). I      wanna know, who did the make-up anyway? 4) The last ten minutes, is that what you call extreme gore?! It's always the same, everybody thinks brains look scary, it's a fobia mankind has had for such a long time now! I would've called the last ten minutes extremely gory if Hannibal and Clarice would have completely eaten (alive!) Paul Krendler and if director Ridley Scott would have shot this in extreme close-up with Krendler horribly screaming with pain! 5) I didn't really like the music, but that's just a matter of taste. What everybody must've really hated about the film is that it was almost constantly (loud) in the movie, it really annoyed me. There were just too few more silent (scary) moments in the film.6) The film should have been more believable and realistic as the first (or second if you count Manhunter as a Hannibal-film). I didn't really like the way the film presented itself as not to be taken too seriously. 7) The love-affair kind-off relationship between Hannibal and Clarice, oh come on people! 8) How the FBI was portrayed! 9) The ending! Hannibal still lives, my God what a cliché! 10) etc., etc., etc.... Overall I'll give this film a 3/4 out of a 10. I strongly recommend to everyone, who has access to the means of making a film, not to do  another film about Hannibal. They should have stayed only with The Silence of the Lambs.",Hannibal

305,grahamcarter-1,Tasty,8,14 May 2017,"In 'The Silence Of The Lambs' (1991), Jame Gumb aka Buffalo Bill skins women to make a 'woman suit' for himself. He believes he is transgender; gender dysphoria is the formal diagnosis used by psychologists to describe people who experience significant discontent with the sex they were assigned at birth. Gumb is literally not at ease in his own skin. Director Jonathan Demme goes more for Hitchcock than Dario Argento (Demme proved himself an able student of Hitchcock with 1979's 'Last Embrace'), but the gender confusion is worth mentioning as an Argento concern, and the film needs to be considered as it leads to 'Hannibal'. Set seven years after 'The Silence of the Lambs', 'Hannibal' revolves around F.B.I Agent Clarice Starling's attempts to apprehend Lecter before his only surviving victim, Mason Verger, captures and kills him. The theme of the film (as opposed to the plot), is established in a scene where Lecter attends an opera of a Dante sonnet. He meets with Detective Pazzi and his wife, Allegra who asks ""Do you believe a man could become so obsessed by a woman after a single encounter?"" Lecter replies ""Yes, I believe he could... but would she see through the bars of his plight and ache for him?""Set partly in Florence (as was Dario Argento's 'Stendhal Syndrome,' 1996 and they share a feel), the look of the Florence sequences leaches out into the rest of the film, giving it a very Italian flavor. No Argento's eye popping primary colours, instead the look of 'The Silence Of The Lambs' has been adhered to in order to give the series a feeling of continuity. Regardless, an Argento flavour is tasted through Ridley Scott's use of shadows, and occasional tricky camera angles, and occasional blasts of the colour red. The presence of Giancarlo Giannini as Detective Pazzi, also adds to the 'Giallo' goings on, as he had played Inspector Tellini in 'The Black Belly Of The Tarantula' (1971). The scene where Pazzi (the 'patsy') is dispatched is pure 'Giallo' in its operatic choreography, and brings back memories of Argento's 'Suspiria'. Other Argento touches are Mason Verger's mask like deformed face, and sequences such as death by man eating pigs. The scene where Lecter cooks for Krendler is one that divides critics and was likely why director Demme and Jodie Foster (who played Starling in 'Lambs'), passed on the sequel. However, rewatching the film I was struck by how little violence there is; but when deployed the violence is high impact.",Hannibal

Now 'Hannibal' has done it again. Although the response has been more muted, its obvious that most film critics actually take 'Hannibal' seriously. But how seriously can you take a film that asks us to believe in an art-loving, literate psychiatrist who just happens to be a serial-killer and cannibal? What sort of genre does this mess of a movie fall into - a horror film that is not frightening, or a thriller devoid of any suspense? Perhaps we should see Hannibal more in keeping with Indiana Jones (remember those monkey skull meals!). After all he is able to murder people in full public gaze, escape detection despite being surrounded by police, fly all over the world and get a job in an art gallery without ever being recognised - despite being on the FBI's 'Top Ten Wanted' list. Ridley Scott, Anthony Hopkins & Co. must be laughing all the way to the bank. I vote this film the biggest con-trick since 'Blair Witch Project'.",Hannibal
307,strangie,Psychoses delve to new highs (or lows),7,27 February 2001,"How on earth this film managed to get an M 15+ rating (children under the age of 15 are allowed to see the film only when accompanied by an adult) in Australia for the first two weeks of its release will remain a mystery for me.  The Australian censors obviously have gone quite mad (especially when films containing graphic sex scenes (non-violent) is deemed to be unsuitable for audiences at all, but graphic violence is fine).  Rest assured, however, after public outcry the rating has been upped to R 18+, a far more suitable rating.  Ok ... venting has been done.  On to the film itself.Hannibal is a film you have to see, simply because you'll either love it or hate it.  I don't think there can be an in-between.  The story is simple enough. It's ""Where's Wally (Waldo)"" - but this time Wally is Hannibal and he's in Europe - somewhere.  Agent Clarice Starling, after being disgraced in the line of duty, is put back on the Hannibal trail.  There's a sub-plot of revenge, with Mason Verger, Hannibal's 4th and only surviving victim, bank-rolling Hannibal's capture.Some people may be disappointed with Clarice's character - she was a meek little thing, compared with Silence of the Lambs where she was a little fiestier.  That's precisely the point!  Clarice basically has a gag order on her the whole film, and Julianne Moore does a wonderful job with the frustration the character has to deal with.  Sir Anthony is wonderfully chilling as Hannibal.While some of the scenes seemed, to me, to be a little implausible side of things, on the whole Hannibal is a great horror/suspence flick, but it does lack the panache and implied violence of Silence of the Lambs.  Hannibal is just a little more (if you'll pardon the pun) in your face!",Hannibal
308,robert-300,After ten years this is the best they could do!,3,12 March 2003,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** *Terrible * * Below Par * * * Not Bad * * * * good * * * * * Brilliant WARNING *SPOILERS* After ten years and a good deal of hype the long awaited follow up to Director Jonathan Demmes oscar winning psychological thriller 'The Silence of the Lambs' hit cinemas across the world. This time around however the project would be helmed by british director Ridley Scott.Best known for his strong visuals in such movies as Alien, Bladerunner and Gladiator one would have wondered how he could go wrong. The story it self was quite simple and would not need a director more capable of telling a more substantial story.The story involves FBI agent Clarice Starlings (Now played by the more glamorous Julianne Moore after Jodie Foster passed on reprising the roll) quest to hunt down the psychotic Dr.Hannibal Lectre who had escaped police custody in prequel some nine years earlier. He is now living under an assumed identity in Florence, Italy. She however is not the only person out to find Lectre.Evil millionaire Mason Verger(Wonderfully played by british actor Gary Oldman), a former patient and victim of Lectre's want's revenge for what was done to him. A child molester, Verger mutilated his own face when Lectre made him take an illegal substance.He then went on to feed the remains of his face to his dogs.This act left Verger on a respirator.Verger plots to have Lectre captured and then fed to a pack of hungry hogs.What revenge could be any better than that for a cannibal.Sadly Vergers plan of revenge is better than what can said for the film. The film also deals with Lectre's obsession for Starling and his attempts to get in touch with her while she at the same time is trying to track him down.This all ofcourse culminates in the film's unsatisfactory climax.The result of changing the ending from what it was in the book.That ending saw Starling being brainwashed by Lectre and becoming his lover.It's little wonder fans of the original novel were not pleased with.It is after all hard to swallow(forgivr the pun) that Starling would allow her self to be manipulated into becoming Lectre's lover.Not only that but a cannibal to boot. Up till the film's climax it is a slow turgid movie that unashamedly turns Lectre into a anti-hero rather than the full blown evil psychotic genius that he really is.He only kills when threatened.Like in the scene where he disembowls an italian policeman above the streets of Florence.The poor cop was attempting to shop Lectre to the american authorities in exchange for the reward money for his capture.Lectre even tells the officer that he won't be paying a visit on the tragic mans wife.Makes you think he can't be all bad, does it? The film does have the odd redeeming qualities.The performances in general are fine.Anthony Hopkins ironically improves on his performance this time around.He's less deadpan and strives to down play the roll of Lectre.The roll this time is more demanding after all and does not see Lectre confined to a cell for the most part of the movie.The sad thing is we never get to see what happened in Lectre's past which made him the monster that he is.Lectre's past was after all coverd in the novel. Anyway, as for Julianne Moore, she does a fine job as Clarice Starling.She on the other hand is not a patch on her predecessor Jodie Foster.As good an actress Moore is she can do nothing to erase foster's well deserved oscar winning performance from our heads.Moore is also too glamorous and attractive to be the 'pure white trash' that Lectre described in the prequel. There is great support as well from Gary Oldman who spends virtually the whole film under layers of make up.He clearly seems to be enjoying himself in the role of the sick degenerate baying for Lectre's blood.It's hard for me to believe that he is not a bigger star than he is.Not only that but he crimminally has never been nominated for an oscar. Ray Liotta is also on hand to lend sold support as well.He portrays the crooked FBI man who unknown to Starling is aiding Verger in his hunt for Lectre.Liotta, a great supporting actor is great as he usually is and is at his slimey best. Scotts direction too desrves high marks.It cannot really be blamed for the faults that centre mainly on the lacklustre script.Scott does everything to use the italian settings of Florence to his advantage.It can truly be said that Scott has a great eye for visual detail.You only need look at his previous films to notice that. Sadly the film lacks any real pace or tension and we never really care about what will become of Starling or Lectre.The film actually could border on offensive as it seems to glorify what Lectre is.I did get the impression at times that we were suppoised to be rooting for him.paticularly in the scenes whre Lectre has been captured by Verger's men and is tied to a cross to await his fate.After all, Lectre did nothing but give Verger what he deseved. In the end Hannibal is not the promising sequel it could of been.If there's anything that makes it worth watching is the films denoument.This contains one of the most jaw dropping scenes in film history and actually had me laughing.It was worth seeing in my local multiplex just to hear the reactions from the rest of the horrified audience. If you have not seen any of the Lectre movies then I would not recommend this.If you wan't to see a good Lectre film then watch either Michael Mann's prequel to 'The Silence of the Lambs' Manhunter with Brian Cox portraying the good doctor or it's 1991 follow up.In my opinion they are far better film's.Robs Rating:* * (Below Par)",Hannibal
309,smoothhoney1265,One more proof that THERE SHOULD BE NO SEQUELS TO GREAT MOVIES,2,27 February 2005,"""Hannibal"", the sequel to the legendary ""The Silence of the Lambs"" takes place some years later. We have again Clarice Starling here (this time played by Julianne Moore), who this time is searching the world for the escaped and highly dangerous Hannibal Lector. She is not the only one. Mason Verger, once being a patient and one could say admirer of Lector (and became obsessed of him), wants to take revenge for something Lector did to him years ago (which I will and can not reveal here).Although I really admired ""The Silence of the Lambs"" for its quality and shocking moments, I tried not to have too great expectations and watched ""Hannibal"" for its sake and partly for the cast (Anthony Hopkins, Ray Liotta and of course Gary Oldman) which leaves almost no wishes left. ""Almost"" because of Julianne Moore, but I'll come back to it later. Unfortunately I have to admit that ""Hannibal"" not only cannot compare to the quality of ""The Silence of Lambs"", it does not even reach the level of ""average"". There are one or two surprising moments in the plot but are they neither scary nor shocking, they sometimes just look ridiculous and most of the time simply disgusting. Although ""Hannibal"" has some kind of a plot (people hunting Lector for personal reasons) until the last second you just don't get where it's aiming at. There is no structure: No preface, no climax, no resolution. People just get together, part, meet another people and now and then somebody dies. The hunt for Lector leads to nowhere and I'd say there is only one highlight, when Lector and Clarice meet at last and he does something very strange but beautiful to her (we're not talking about sex here). But all in one the movie is boring, celebrates the cleverness of Lector and the (emotional) coolness of Clarice from time to time but besides this doesn't even make the effort to deal closer with the four protagonists, their feelings etc. That's why the viewer cannot feel with them and after ½ hour asks himself: ""Why should I worry about them at all if even the script doesn't?"" Talking of the script: Either it was not finished or changed so often by so many people that one just doesn't understand what they wanted to say with this film.A word about the cast: Anthony Hopkins is brilliant as usual and just a pleasure to watch. Ray Liotta has an unthankful role as Starling's boss for reasons I cannot reveal but if you see the movie you'll understand why. Gary Oldman shines through this movie mess and even manages to save his ridiculous role (with his unique sarcasm) and give it some dignity, but actually has an unthankful role too. The worst thing about ""Hannibal"" is Julianne Moore. Jodie Foster wasn't a very emotional Clarice, too, but still she is a great actress, she could add a dignity, sex-appeal and a fragility to this role that Moore can only dream of. Julianne Moore is just a bad actress, lacking class, charisma and basically everything that is human  I think if you replaced her by a dummy and let someone speak her lines from off screen you wouldn't notice a difference. And by miscasting the leading role the producers basically ruined the movie from the beginning on. All in one I'd say that the only reason (or three reasons) why you should see this movie are its male protagonists, but ""Hannibal"" is just boring and dumb and cannot in any way be compared to ""The Silence of the Lambs"". In fact, this sequel is an insult to the first film. So if you want to see a good movie, do yourself a favour and watch the original instead. Don't, just don't ever do a sequel to a great movie  when will Hollywood learn that at last???",Hannibal
310,gfmcniven,Worst Thomas Harris adaption,5,24 October 2020,"Compared to all the other adaptations I thought this was the worse and dumbest. Perfect example; in another movie Hannibal was locked up in a jail cell and he easily escaped but here one of his hands is handcuffed but he was in easy reach of a lot of the kitchen and all he could think of to do to get away was to cut off his hand..really???? I gave this 5 stars cause I got through the movie,barely but I did",Hannibal
311,korch-3,Not as good as Silence of the Lambs... then again... What is?,6,20 September 2001,"I was worried at first. I was thinking can a sequel to Silence of the Lambs really be made?  The answer is no, and for good reason. This movie is not really a sequel. Both movies work independently of one another. You do not need to see one to enjoy the other. And that is a good thing. Silence of the Lambs was (and is still) such a great film that a sequel should never have been made. Just like Led Zeppelin never tried to write Stairway to Heaven 2, Ridley Scott decided not to make Silence of the Lambs 2. This movie is a departure from the original. Please view it as such.The movie does get a little silly now and then for what simply seems to be shock value, but overall is a good film, with some great acting by Anthony Hopkins. Thanks to his and Gary Oldman's performances, I would rate this movie about a 7 out of 10. Without them, it may have been a lot lower.",Hannibal
312,sperman,Pretty bad...,3,16 March 2001,"Ok the movie was below expectance: no thrilling, no excitement. After 10 minutes one could already guess the end!!! This is definitely NOT the way to make a good thriller: I think they completely spoiled the wonderful character of Hannibal Lector they had created in the ""Silence of Lambs"". This one is too much. Too... too pervert, too sick. Few nice dialogs (VERY few though) and a couple of funny scenes make it decent, but nothing more!",Hannibal
313,Thomas-Giffin,The weakest film to feature Hannibal Lecter,5,26 March 2012,"This sequel to the seminal Silence of the Lambs is a mixed meal. At times gripping, thrilling and beautiful, at other times it is confusing, slow and clumsy. One of the best parts of the film is Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter, he IS Hannibal and whilst not as menacing, intelligent or as complex as he is in 'Silence', he is none-the-less one of the film's stronger points. The lack of return of Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling is one of the film's weaker points. Julianne Moore tries her best but doesn't have the emotional vulnerability and connection with Dr. Lecter that Foster had. Also, Julianne Moore slips in and out of the old West Virginian twang that played such a surprisingly large role in 'Silence' far too noticeably. This is not one of Director Ridley Scott's best films and the direction is not the reason why. The film looks fantastic, the city of Florence in particular becomes a gruesome and macabre setting for the grisly proceedings. Several scenes in particular had me feeling quite nauseous, although possibly in part to blurring motion rather than the events in the scene. The film, adapted from the novel by Thomas Harris follows a very similar narrative and the story idea itself is simple and effective. One of Lecter's victims wants revenge. Simple, powerful and eerie, an unrecognisable Gary Oldman (seriously) plays Mason Verger. A single- minded wealthy man who had the misfortune of crossing Lecter's path.The main issue I have with the film is that it's surprisingly heavy handed. In this, at time it appears that Lecter is a redemptive moral story instead of a brilliant serial killer. His relationship with Starling again is too subtle, the fondness from Silence is still present but it's not as a awkward or as powerful as the scenes between Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins. The ideas of corruption and redemption are further weaved around an idea of romance. Something that was hinted at but never as explicit as it is here. So instead of a brilliantly complex psychological thriller with well crafted characters and razor tight scripting, you have a slightly clumsy, pseudo religious horror film. It's not bad per se, but it pales in comparison to films in the series both older and newer.Read further reviews at: http://thegiff.typepad.com/film_flare/",Hannibal
314,d-apergis,limp and ponderous,4,22 December 2009,"Producing a sequel to ""The Silence Of the Lambs"" was never going to be an easy task. But then again, delivering an outing as bland as this one is quite a remarkable achievement in itself. Veneered with some pictorial elegance, as was expected from director Scott, it tries in vain to compensate for a narrative as limp and ponderous as Mason Verger, Lecter's wheelchair-bound nemesis. In its discomfiture to adopt a right footing, the film is forced to duly provide a few gory moments shamelessly reducing the brilliant and dangerous psychiatrist we adored into a gastronomer boogeyman as scary as toasted bread. Ultimately, trapped by its inept plot line and having nowhere to go, the film concludes with an ending which must rank amongst the gravest mistakes in the history of cinema. Pity.",Hannibal
315,averjee,Excellent follow up,10,11 February 2001,"Terrific film - in ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" Lecter was trapped, a locus of evil whose mind only was free to roam. Lecter on the loose is also a compelling villain, cunning, escaping from traps and slippery as an eel. A new vllain, Mason Verger (played by Gary Oldman) is a superb joining of skill and diabolical imagination. He is as twisted as Lecter, and even trapped in his palace he is a terrifying foe.   Starling is a weaker character than she was - drier, more cynical, more closed off than the young idealist we met 10 years ago. Much of the story revolves around her, and her problems within the Bureau, but the real fun is the search and chase around Lecter. A Florence detective named Rinaldo Pazzi (played by Giancarlo Giannini) suspects that a local art curator is actually Hannibal Lecter, and decides to shop him to Verger for a $3 million reward. This turns out to be a spectacularly bad idea - in SILENCE, we had fun as we learned about Starling, and here the Pazzi character is just as good.   This is a bold, gruesome film - the brain-eating scene, a man peeling off his face with a broken mirror, wild pigs specially bred to eat a man alive feet first - all of these elements from the Thomas Harris novel survive to the big screen.",Hannibal
316,AS-69,Disappointing!,6,31 August 2001,"Being a gifted director, Ridley Scott delivers with ""Hannibal"" a technically perfect movie with extremely macabre scenes. Unfortunately, the movie is completely void of content. Scott has succeeded in making the character of Hannibal Lecter and his relationship with Clarice Starling totally incredible. The emptiness of the movie is filled with extremely violent scenes.At least, this shows how ridiculous censorship has always been and always will be. Being a fan of Italian horror movies, my list of favourite movies in this genre is almost identical to the one of movies banned in Germany. Now, I am sitting in a movie theatre watching Anthony Hopkins performing surgery on an open brain and frying part of the brain in a pan, and this is now allowed, just because a big studio is behind it.",Hannibal
317,EdF135,"Friday the 13th part N, Jason goes to Italia, oops I mean Italy",3,12 February 2001,"Strangely enough, the Italians forgot how to speak Italian until the came to the US!  But anyway, this wasn't a horrible movie, it's just that a lot of the things I love about Silence were dispensed with this time around.  I found Hannibal to be a much more intriguing character the first go-round, and the difference definitely wasn't the fault of Anthony Hopkins who always delivers as far as I'm concerned (even in Instinct!).  More likely it was such things as having his motivations given away (i.e. being told he doesn't like rude people) instead of wondering what it was and trying to figure that out.  The blood-letting was really overdone despite the fact that more blood should have been expected this time than before since Hannibal was now on the loose.  I normally expect to be disappointed by sequels and I did/was by this one.  It was an okay way to spend a Sunday afternoon, but I won't bother seeing it again and again as I did Silence of the Lambs.",Hannibal
318,TobyS,Fantastic follow-up...but watch on an empty stomach,10,11 February 2001,"I just returned from seeing Hannibal, and this film blew me away!  I loved Silence of the Lambs, and was very worried about how Hannibal would turn out when I heard that Jodie Foster would not reprise her role. My fears were unfounded.  Julianne Moore is a perfect choice for Clarice, and Sir Anthony Hopkins reaches the lofty goals of reprising one of the most famous roles in cinema.  Ridley Scott directs them both, along with an unrecognizable Gary Oldman in this beautifully filmed modern gothic horror. 
Is Hannibal gory?  Yes, it is.  We're not talking Scream type of gore that we've all seen in every slasher film ever filmed.  Ridley Scott walks a fine line of faithfully bringing Thomas Harris' graphic book to screen, while at the same time trying to keep an ""R"" rating, one scene alone needs to be seen to be believed.  This is a film that the violence is warranted (Hannibal is a cannibal...what do you expect him to do?) Will you like Hannibal?  I don't know.  Did I like it?  Yes, I did.  Do I think you'll like it also?  Yes, I'm certain you will.  Just don't eat a steak or spaghetti dinner before you go.My grade: A+",Hannibal

I read the book, too, which fed my interest.  But let me tell you folks, this one was *bad*...The whole production quality is terrible.  The script is cheap; it tries to be sophisticated and clever to live up to Ted Tally's ""SILENCE"" script, but it doesn't.  The casting is simply terrible (with the obvious exclusion of Anthony Hopkins, whose always exhilerating performance is the sole reason for the *1/2 rating).  Julianne Moore tries, but she just can't live up to Jodie Foster's subtle strength and assurance.  All other co-stars are, plainly put, a shame.<POSSIBLE SPOILERS>  One thing that bothered me was how Mason Verger was made out to be some sort of gerbil.  His face was skinned, but that doesn't cause his face to be lop-sided and distorted, or his hands to be gnarly and his body limber and elderly.  Why oh why they felt they had to do that, is beyond me.  Just to get a few whimpers out of the audience?

321,KubrickCRM114,Not a film for Thomas Harris readers.,6,1 March 2003,"At the first sign of a film being made from the new novel, it was pretty much accepted that it probably wouldn't be as good as Silence of the Lambs, and the ending would almost definatly be changed.  Both were right, sadly. I absolutely loved the book, and I thought the ending was perfect, and totally disagreed with people who thought it was too much of a stretch.  It is Harris' book, he controls the characters, if you don't like it don't read it. But, somewhere along the lines Steve Zallian was brought in to take the scissors to it.  So many important plot points, sub-plots, and characters were simply removed or made shallow and one-dimensional.  Granted, there is no way for the 500 plus page novel to be perfectly adapted to film, but so many things were changed for seemingly no reason.  Unfortunately, I do not want to point out specifics for fear of spoiling the film for first-time viewers. For the first time (before Red Dragon came out) I was unsure of Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter.  It seemed just a little too over-the-top, being more lunatic than cold, calculating sociopath in some scenes.  Keep in mind, these are all in comparison with the book. Now, on the other hand, if you haven't read the books, this is a rather good thriller.  Julianne Moore gives a pretty good performance considering she had to live up to Jody Foster's legendary performance in Silence.  Ridley Scott does a great job keeping the tension high, and presenting Florence beautifully.  All cast and crew do a great job, and this is somewhat shadowed by reviews like my own above, but if you don't read and like thrillers, watch and enjoy!",Hannibal

The original was dark with a thrilling atmosphere, this isn't dark neither with a thrilled atmosphere, just silly. People also called it violent, I've seen worst than this. Some of the acting was great, especially Hopkins' role as Hannibal (of course not paring up to his excellent role in The Silence of the Lambs). There is one other good thing to it, they didn't use the ol' ""Silence of the Lambs 2"" title. I was hoping for it to be decent, like what we always ask for when we are about to see a film, but instead, we got an over-hyped, typically merited for a sequel film. The script and plot are alright, but nothing special. The ""I'd like to eat your wife for dinner"" line was pretty good. The plot isn't so bad. There's been worst. And the plot is were Hannibal moves out of the country to continue his cannibalism that was delayed for about a decade.

That being said, the film is pretty good, better than I expected actually. Anthony Hopkins as always gives an outstanding performance. He is so creepy and bizarre, its just great. Ray Liotta also does good, but that actually goes for most of the cast in the movie. Its a great thriller and good follow up. However, unlike silence of the lambs, which was more subtle with the outright violence, this is much more gruesome and cringe worthy, especially one scene (sure to shock viewers).

328,Kynde,Macabre Hannibal.,7,23 February 2001,"Yesterday I saw Anthony Hopkins in his glamorous part as Hannibal the Cannibal Lector. It was very entertaining, very bloody, very disgusting and very different. But was it good? Not good enough! First of all I'm missing Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling. All credit to Julianne Moore who is probably the Hollywood actress that has the closest resemblance with Jodie Foster, however, she is not the real thing. Secondly the psychological game between her and Hannibal is not even close to being that intense as in the predecessor. Third it is a sequel and we can't help comparing to the now classic horror movie Silence of the Lamb, which inevitable will leave us disappointed. I will neither recommend or discourage anyone from seeing it. Rather I will ask them to find out if they think a brilliant doctor (MD), with lust for bizarre murders and sometimes cannibalism, would be able to do things to other humans, that you might not enjoy seeing very explicit on the big screen? Because this is a fourth point where the first movie was better. It really did not show all the nasty stuff that happens very clearly, while in Hannibal we almost see everything, and then a little more in each of the four most disgusting scenes. To me it is so far fetched, that I couldn't really take it seriously, which meant that the movie never got under my skin, like the first movie did. Instead I was amused/enjoying the macabre details, that you would only expect to find in movies like The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and not in a movie with a Oscar winning actor and nominated actress in the lead, directed by an at present Oscar nominated director, for his last movie Gladiator (12 nominations): Ridley Scott.But if you think you can stand the gore, then have a friend for dinner, enjoy him and a good Chianti, before going to see Hannibal!

330,chets808,Another One BITES the Dust !,5,23 September 2001,"Minor spoilers.Poor writing, and the sexual pretense of most of the major characters notwithstanding, Hannibal is a well crafted movie, obviously not for the faint of heart, however, its fatal flaw lies in its trueness to the source material. Unfortunately, when the master print is tainted, so to are all the copies from that master.Moore is fine as Starling, yet Starling is a shell of the person she was in SOTL with very little of the vulnerable ambition she once displayed; Gary Oldman gets to do Zorg again, this time from a wheelchair; Tony Hopkins again is fine as the lead (Is he ever bad ?); Giancarlo fits nicely in his role; and the rest save for Liotta play well, its just the pastiche mode of storytelling wears thin after 120 mins and the shock/revelation of the ending does not validate the investment.I'm not the first to make this observation, but I found it to be the most revealing - In Silence of the Lambs, Lecter was truly frightening because of the possibilty he might escape. He seemed ahead of everyone at every step of the way despite being totally restrained - that helped set the tension and mood. Now in Hannibal, he is out galavanting all over the place, one moment he is giving an art class in Florence, the next he is moving between shadows in D.C. even though he is on the FBI's most wanted list; well, the problem lies therein; its just not as scary now that he can move freely among us (and apparently with a sizable bank account to FEED on among other things) . Throughout SOTL we were waiting, wondering, anticipating if Dr. Lecter, who at once embodied pure evil and extreme politeness (a delicious combination), would lash out and terrify us whereas now he is doing it at every turn without impunity.Unfortunately, Hannibal somewhat scars the entire series by appealing to those with an APPETITE for obscenity and yet you cannot entirely blame the filmmakers for all they did was transfer most admirably to celluloid what was on linen.",Hannibal
331,sean_36,"nowhere near Silence,but the best that could have come from the novel",6,5 December 2001,"Let me start off by saying that I loved The Silence of the Lambs.  It's one of my favorite movies of all time, with great performances by Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins and good direction by Jonathan Demme.  Hannibal however, is nowhere near as great, and I guarantee it will not be winning the 5 Oscars that Silence did.  It has none of the cleaver suspense or chilling moments that made the first one so great, and while Julianne Moore is a terrific actress (she would probably have been my second choice for the role as well) and does a half-decent job as F.B.I agent Clarice Starling, she doesn't have the warm and sympathetic touch that Foster brought to the role. As for Hopkins, he has some good moments but for the most part is not scary at all.  Granted, the story takes place 10 years after the original and finds Dr. Hannibal ""the cannibal"" Lector trying to live a normal life in Italy, not to mention that in the book it was said that he had plastic surgery to change his looks.  So perhaps he has no real reason to act all evil and cunning, but still, isn't that what made the first one so much fun. The story this time has a former victim of Lectors' (played by Gary Oldman under loads of funny looking makeup) trying to capture him and then feed him to a bunch of giant hogs.  It's one of those things that sounds ok on paper but looks kind of dumb on screen.  But perhaps that's why I was not too disappointed with Hannibal, because I read the book first.  And since I read the book first I knew what to expect and therefore could not be completely bummed out when it didn't measure up to Silence.  That being said I think this was probably the best movie that could have come from that novel.  I say this because of one big change made to the end. The end of the book was not only completely stupid but betrayed everything that we had been told about the characters (before they had a script this was the main reason Foster turned down the project). The film's ending however is excellent, and will probably go down in history as one of the best 10 minutes of pure evil ever to grace the screen.  So, check it out for yourself and afterwards be sure to finish off the evening with some liver along with fava beans and a nice Chianti.",Hannibal
332,Bigbang,A high grade slasher film,6,11 February 2001,"Basically Hannibal is a high grade and well produced slasher film, it wasn't the psychological thriller the first one was. Anthony Hopkins was entertaining but didnt have anything particularly interesting to say. Julianne Moore who seems to be one of the best actresses working today, was somewhat devoid of emotion and character depth due to the limited material. Suspense built at an extremely slow pace, and when I start thinking about how my ass is falling asleep I know the movie is not doing a good enough job absorbing me into the story.(***minor spoilers***) The first scene of the movie (an FBI and DEA drug bust) confirmed my suspicions that this movie was going to contain cliches and stereotypes, which I hate and usually ruin a movie for me. When was the last time federal agents just started shooting randomly at people in a crowded street? I'm sorry it just doesn't happen. Ray Liotta's character was your typical ""bad guy who says and does nothing but bad things"". Do bad people exist? Yes but it came off as cliched here and helped ruin the movie. Of couse the FBI top brass were all bad white men who want nothing more out of life than to bring Clarice down.  She shot at a woman who was carrying a baby, but the woman shot at her first. I believe the FBI would be behind Clarice on this in real life. But it wouldn't have helped the plot device of poooor Clarice everyone is against her.The film looked absolutely great, Ridley Scott and co. did a nice job. The film had shocking death scenes and I'm not one to be shocked by anything. At certain points I wanted to turn my head but kept watching in perverse fascination. But that's all there was really, the hunt for Lecter by a few people, and gory death scenes. Not much else. On the whole, I still recommend Hannibal because it was an above average movie by todays crappy standards but not when measured up to the first.6.5 out of 10",Hannibal
333,Hypotheses,Lowest Common Denominator,7,7 November 2001,"HannibalHow many times have I got to say that style over substance is sacrilege?
Before his movie-making career, Ridley Scott directed TV commercials. His work, even then, was very characteristic, for Scott obviously had a keen eye for visuals. But that talent does not necessarily translate into good film making. This leads me to point out a common criticism of Scott's films: great visuals, but no character development. This certainly applies to Hannibal.In all of its 131-minute running time, Hannibal seems unable to reveal anything of real value about Agent Starling and Dr. Lector, despite having a decade both in the film and in reality to put it there. The film is nothing but a pleasing menagerie of slow-motion shots, grand scenes, luscious music and costumes. Unforgivably absent are the mental foreplay and psychological terror of Silence of the Lambs. Instead, we're given filler.
Its predecessor, Silence of the Lambs, was essentially a stark, static film as far as the camera was concerned. The main emphasis there was on the characters Agent Starling and Dr. Lector. Hannibal, by contrast, works so diligently to globe trot and dazzle us with pretty pictures (sunsets, mist , slow-motion, staging, hue effects, etc.), that the story and characters seem hardly important.The plotting and motivations of the characters are simplistic and formulaic compared to that earlier film. We basically get a sandwich structure of scenes slapped together that don't really make a coherent film. The first slice is the disgrace of Agent Starling and the reawakening of Lector. The meat is nothing but endless back and forth scenes, lightly reminiscent of that awful The Specialist. And the bottom slice is the inexplicable return of Hannibal to America just to ""save"" Starling, kill a few people, let an unrecognizable Gary Oldman exact his revenge, only, of course, to end with Lector getting away.I'm tiring of writing about Scott's crappy film. The deal was simply slow, predictable, favoring the LCD, and not really worth the effort.

334,TheDuke-2,Not that bad,7,21 February 2001,"Many people, including critics have been giving this movie a bad rap from the get go.  Let me just say that this is not Silence of The Lambs and never was intended on being the same movie.  Now with that being said, I will say that the movie did exactly what I expected it to do and a bit more.  This movie was about Hannibal Lector being free to roam around as he chooses, not to be locked in a cage and act like an animal.  Hannibal Lector is a brilliant and sophisticated individual, one that doesn't have to kill people every 5 minutes like many people thought he should.  No, he goes to the theatre, shops, paints, and acts like anyone else would in France.  If people would notice in the movie, he only killed when he had to, not just because.  Hannibal was the prey in the movie until the very end, when he switches to the Predator.  Hannibal also only killed people that were considered rude or arrogant.  Lastly there was a part of the movie that brought out Hannibal's true love for Clarice and Clarice's respect for Hannibal.  It almost reminded me of the background love story that was in Coppola's Dracula a few years back, between Mina and the Count.  This was lost in any of the critics opinions of the movie and I'm sad to see that. Overall it was a good movie (As a stand alone movie) and the gore was not as bad as many made it out to be (Especially for this type of movie - Braveheart had more)",Hannibal
335,Inliten,"Gore, guts, and a hell of an interesting ride",8,13 December 2002,"While 'Hannibal' fails to live up to its predecessor, 'The Silence of the Lambs' (honestly, who expected it to?), the film is still an enjoyable foray into the mind of a genious, that of Dr. Hannibal Lecter.I haven't read the Thomas Harris novel, so I cannot comment on the adaptation's accuracy to the book.  I've heard, however, that the film strays inexcusably from said book.  This is unfortunate, but certainly not an uncommon occurrence.Without a doubt, Anthony Hopkins saves this movie from being nothing more than a gore-fest.  A similarly stellar performance from an unrecognizable Gary Oldman (as Mason Verger) lends further reason to see this film.Obviously, 'Hannibal' wasn't meant for children's eyes.  While 'Silence' gained its suspense through imagination, 'Hannibal' gains its suspense through overt, grisly images.  Apparently, this is one of the reasons Jodie Foster passed on returning to the role of (now FBI agent) Clarice Starling. It's certainly a shame that Ms. Foster did not reprise her role, but Julianne Moore does well in her place.  Giancarlo Giannini also lends his talents well as Chief Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi.Despite any of its faults, seeing 'Hannibal' is certainly not a bad way to spend a couple of hours.  The story is both interesting and suspenseful, albeit less so than 'Silence.'",Hannibal

339,enjoyuk,Unworthy Sequel,6,20 February 2001,"I was so looking forward to a sequel to 1991's Silence of the Lambs, after a decade of waiting to see a worthy follow-up, we get the disappointing 'Hannibal'.  When I heard that Jodie Foster had dropped out of the production, I honestly thought that making this movie would be a terrible mistake. When it was announced that the excellent Julianne Moore was going to step into the part, I thought that it could work but didnt really want it to happen.  Its kind of the same feeling when you hear that someone is to take over the character of James Bond or Batman (if you are a fan!). Moore was not to blame for the disappointment of this movie though, overall she was OK, but I think 'Hannibal's' problems lie with the script, the writing and the producers wishes to create a popcorn franchise. Is it just me or did anybody else find Hopkin's Lecter far more menacing when he was incarcerated?. Lecter's Transatlantic hoppings to me were unbelievable, OK the character is supposed to be of a high intelligence, but dont you think that he may realise that some sort of disguise may be needed to jump a commercial flight especially when you are on the FBI's 10 most wanted list.  Didnt the FBI think to look for him in Florence for 10 years considering he had a picture he had painted (from memory, no less!) of the city in his cell in Baltimore.I feel like Im nit-picking now, but if you are going to make a high budget sequel to one of the best thrillers of the last 20 years, at least give the viewers some credibility.On a final note and to highlight the last point, the last thirty minutes of this movie contain the most ludicrous, tongue-in-cheek scenes I have witnessed in a production of this calibre.

Surrounded by so many creeps, he comes off almost like a prince, which is, I'm sure, Harris' intent (implicating us, the audience, by Lecter-seduction ).Julianne Moore is great as Clarice; I find no weakness in her as an actress, but she and Hopkins fail to generate that elusive spark that propelled ""Lambs"".The actual plot here appears to be the weak link.  I won't go into details, but that's my initial impression.I also saw this one in a theater packed with talking, back-of-my-chair-kicking, cell phone chatting, cat-calling buffoons.

341,Lt Wolf Maker,BON APPETIT!,8,12 February 2001,"As a side note, I did NOT read the novel so this review is based on a fresh view of the story not revealed to me prior in any sense. Also, to respect the future viewer, NO SPOILERS I promise.There is a lot of glory here.  The first hour is incoherent, to me at least. And you sit there, wondering...the film not discerning itself extremely well.  And the ""cannibalism"" is not that rampant as everyone had warned. Actually it didn't bother me one bit (what fleshism that was there had a dreamy quality and was fast enough so it didn't wander too long for a bad cinematic aftertaste - pardon the pun).So anyway you sit and you watch.  Happy because Hannibal Lector is just an awesome character.  He's sexy and somewhat fascinating...so you wait for him.  And so the first hour rumbles by like an empty stomach.And then something delicious happens.  Finally, oh finally!  Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter FINALLY have contact!  Now realize this people, somehow through it all Clarice and Hannibal in some twisted way belong together and somehow this Ridley Scott film is, in disguise, a love story that plays softly and delicately so much so that even a woman could find pleasure in it...since as I've said Hannibal is sexy and very attractive. And now to reference the more-personalized ""Silence of the Lambs"" (which was psychological, carefully paced and SCARY AS HELL), ""Hannibal"" is faster - more entertaining and splashy.For me the entire movie took off when Hannibal and Clarice actually were physically in scenes together.  That was the entire FIRE of the film!  And with the softly beautiful Julianne Moore in Jodie Foster's role it seemed to fit.  Julianne has an olden century romanticism about her ....she's more toughened and exacting as an actress while Julianne's style is more like a breath upon the screen.And the ending!  I will not give it away, but I absolutely LOVED IT!  The whole previous relationship between Hannibal and Clarice is climaxed here, and how beautifully captured.  Of course the big ""gory"" scene everyone will think about for months - it was fascinating.  The viewer must realize it is only a movie, just a fictional opera portrayed by actors...but the end itself is dreamy.  It is both silently aggravating, yet funny!  Hannibal's softness and tease with Clarice is strangely romantic and the last 30 minutes or so of this movie are why I recommend it, and why I loved it and why it justifies sitting through the incoherent first hour.Good.

342,JasonS-5,A Butchering of the Novel,1,2 August 2002,"The novel, ""Hannibal"" was a truly brilliant book -- both terrifying and beautifully written, it actually gave the reader sympathy for Hannibal Lecter. The movie, however, had none of the beauty but all of the horror, depicting in loving detail all of the scenes of graphic violence, but including none of the back-story which gives such a well-rounded portrait of Hannibal. About half the movie was remarkably faithful to the book, but then it began to stray, and the ending was discordant and bore no similarity whatsoever to the book. It was an ugly movie that transformed Hannibal from a stunning portrait of psychosis to nothing more than a horror-film villain. I regret going to see it.",Hannibal
343,chain67,Mesmerizing,8,10 February 2001,"Hannibal isn't better than Silence of the Lambs it's just different. It is more entertaining and much more graphic and gruesome. One thing that is an improvement is the acting. Anthony Hopkins puts in the best performance of his career outdoing his Silence of the Lambs performance. Julianne Moore makes Clarice Starling her own character. Moore in my opinion completely in all forms of the word outdoes Jodie Foster's work in the previous movie. Ray Liotta in my opinion is completely wasted playing a totally stereotypical role of the superior officer who has it in for Clarice. A completely unrecognisable Gary Oldman(Who unlike a few people said is credited in the end credits) is brilliant as usual in his role as Mason Verger. But the person solely responsible for Hannibal being as good as it was is director Ridley Scott. His great direction makes every scene seem beautiful. I won't lie this movie is extremely gruesome, sick and graphic at times. In one scene in specific people were leaving the theatre in disgust. During that scene I heard people in the audience saying things like 'Oh My God','Holy Christ' and 'This is sick'. Hannibal isn't for everyone but if you have a strong stomach I suggest you see it. 8/10",Hannibal
344,craigboney,"Very good, but not ""filling""",7,24 February 2001,"This movie is beautifully shot, incredibly acted, superbly scored and at times gut-wrenchingly gruesome.  However, the script is variable, some very unfunny jokes tossed in, and the story, which I won't go into detail with exactly how and why, seems a bit weak.The premise is simple.  Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore) is the top female FBI agent.  An attempted drug arrest goes wrong, and Starling is left with egg on her face.  She is put back onto the case of Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) to give her an opportunity to, ahem, get her teeth into something. Lecter has been whereabouts unknown for 10 years.  An Italian detective named Pazzi (Giancarlo Gianni) stumbles across Lecter unknowingly during another case and via checking the FBI most wanted website suddenly realises that he has a huge reward possibly staring him in the face.  Clarice contacts Pazzi with regard to a security tape which confirms Lecter's presence in Florence, but Pazzi wants the 3 million dollar reward on offer from the gruesomely disfigured Mason Verger (Gary Oldman) who suffered at Hannibal's hands some years before and is out for revenge.  That's the bare bones of the story in the first half and the film starts brightly, at a good pace and creating a great atmosphere.  The pace drops in the middle and certain questions you can't help but ask. How does Hannibal, one of the FBI's 10 most wanted, fly on a public jumbo jet from Florence to the US with consumate ease?  OK, the guy is a master criminal but y'know?  Anyway the action moves to the US and Paul Krendler (Ray Liotta - hey long time no see!) ;who has some sort of no-brain macho mindset and is trying to stymie Starling's faltering career; comes more into the story a bit more.My main problem with this film was it's ending.  Not to give anything away, but I was really getting into the film and it just sort of finished.  I was entertained but felt a little short changed by the suddenness of it, and was genuinely surprised and disappointed when the credits rolled.  This may be, I admit, because the story didn't develop how I'd expected it to, and hey, that's my fault I suppose.  But the movie had promised a little more in it's starter and main course to leave me with a rather annoying lack of pudding(not that I was really hungry after the end, you understand).But still, well worth watching and one that you think about after you've seen it.. 8/10.",Hannibal

I just think this movie went over a lot of people's heads. Sir Anthony Hopkins plays Hannibal with the same intensity as he did in SOTL, and made me uncomfortable everytime he even neared someone. Usually, Julianne Moore bugs me, but she was a very worthy replacement to Jodie Foster. But it was Gary Oldman, whom I enjoyed just as much as Hopkins (If not better). His potrayal of Mason Verger was as hilariously funny as he was visually sickening (""Nothing beats the Ris""). A very worthy follow-up, and a very different movie than SOTL. I went to this movie expecting something different than SOTL, and I was very satisfied.

Well Hannibal is, disappointedly, far from it. Scott's normally masterful, stylistic direction is quite irregular in Hannibal. Some scenes carry his wonderful flare and others definitely do not. Steven Zaillian and David Mamet's screenplay is not what you would come to expect from the men who wrote Schindler's List and The Untouchables. Like Scott's direction, the screenplay is quite uneven in quality. I think they had a little too much fun with some of the characters. There are some very awkward lines of dialogue. The pacing isn't the greatest either. After the opening shoot-out, the film takes a while to get going again. Anthony Hopkins gives a solid performance as well as Julianne Moore but I couldn't help but miss Jodie Foster. Gary Oldman delivers an unnecessarily over-the-top performance and comes off as being quite annoying sometimes, as the disturbed Mason Verger.

357,AloysiusWeasley,Too many deviations from the original source material,5,2 December 2007,"*****SPOILERS FOR THE BOOK AND THE MOVIE!!!****** I just finished the books, after seeing both Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal in movie form beforehand. I've mentioned this in some of my other reviews beforehand, but let me say it again: I HATE movies that deviate from the original source material! I'm tired of seeing it ALL the TIME, and it's quite nearly reached the point where if Hollywood refuses to do justice to the books they're adapting, then I'll no longer see adapted movies.All right, on to the movie. Anthony Hopkins does an incredible job as Dr. Hannibal Lector again, with only a handful of changes I could have suggested. As does Gary Oldman, playing Mason Verger - what a pleasant surprise! We got a new actress playing Clarice Starling, since Jodie Foster is...well, if you've read up about this movie in the message boards, she refused to play in Hannibal because she didn't like the ending. How terribly arrogant. Luckily, however, we got a competent actress as a replacement.The movie admittedly did drag in a few places, but overall was pretty good until it hit the part where Hannibal escapes from Mason Verger's barn with Clarice. Right there is when the movie begins to deviate from the book ending, and it begins to slide downward into mediocrity. Let me count the ways: - Hannibal's psychological manipulations of Clarice are cut.It was immediately apparent that Clarice was turned into some flighty creature while at the dinner table, as opposed to the utter poise and self-confidence she displayed in the book.In the book, she ENJOYED eating Krender's brain. In the movie, she fell from the table in drugged horror, which begun the whole bit where she tried to catch Hannibal but he ended cutting off his own hand to escape her handcuffs instead.So basically, by deviating from the book, the ending was turned into easily-forgettable, typical Hollywood fodder. This movie could have positive *shone*, becoming a controversial movie for the ages along with its predecessor, Silence of the Lambs. Instead, it attains a relatively low rating on this site, all because of arrogance and cowardice.I gave this movie 5 stars for the excellent performances of Anthony Hopkins and Gary Oldman (Along with an honorable mention for Julianne Moore). Also, the movie was pretty good right up until it hit the halfway point, so perhaps it could be viewed as half the number of stars for half a good movie.",Hannibal
358,den_quixote,worst high budget movie I have ever seen,1,20 January 2006,"the music and cinematography are both outstanding. giancarlo gianini's performance is average or better for him, which is basically pretty darn good. The plot however is extremely predictable and the acting of the stars is mediocre in the case of hopkins to atrocious in the case of moore. in spite of the absolutely disgusting subject matter and the extremely graphic depiction of it, I was half hoping Hannibal would eat Starling just to see if she would actually show some emotion, but my guess is she would not. spoiler beyond this point - although it would be impossible to spoil this film any more than the director, writers and actors already have done. the final scene is easily the most vile and perverted ever put on film. hannibal has once again escaped starling's clutches (by axing his own hand off, to escape the handcuffs starling used to bind him to her - instead of axing off her hand.) prior to that he had made a dinner which included portions of ray liotta's brain. apparently he had some left over and had it included in the meal he secured for himself to eat aboard an airplane while escaping. he then offers a portion of the brain dish to an 8 year old who had not liked the food served to him by the airline. Hannibal says ""my mother always said you should try new things."" That is absolutely sick.i know it's unlikely that anyone will read this review given the other 123 pages but please avoid this movie.",Hannibal
359,charmaments,My personal favorite of the series,9,3 January 2017,"Yes, this is an unpopular opinion but I simply prefer this film to The Silence of the Lambs, having watched both in the span of 24 hours. There's just much more story here.The difference between the two is the story, in this one, there's the intertwining of many stories - four investigations - the FBI under Starling, the FBI under Krendler (under the influence of Verger), Starling's own investigation after her suspension, Pazzi's own investigation for the purpose of earning a reward. These are all intertwined by the common thread of Verger, who buys Krendler and the FBI outright (and cheaply, I might add), hires Inspector Pazzi in the conspiracy to kidnap and uses Starling as bait.This film is more gruesome than TSOTL, the boars, the brain surgery and was very funny at times, such as when Hannibal overhears a couple saying ""Let's get something to eat"" and answers ""Why not?"" to himself.This film is still fresh after all these years because it introduces something that is rare in cinema - the sophisticated and moral madman. Hollywood is filled with crazy inbred chainsaw madmen who live in areas with poor cellphone service. Then there are the often sophisticated Nazis, who are not moral, funny or likable. Rarely do you see a film about a villain going after another villain and have the audience root for him to get away with it.Things are much simpler these days - good guys and bad guys, or flawed heroes and villains with a backstory, but it's still black and white.This film is criminally underrated.",Hannibal

361,mjanky,Hannibal turns into a parody of himself in this one.,6,18 April 2001,"This movie's not bad, but it's hard not to compare it to Silence of the Lambs, which in comparison...is bad. It never seems to work, when the killer starts to create gimmicky ways to kill people (ala Halloween II). Anthony Hopkins is great as usual, but he parodies himself here. He doesn't seem as evil, just more vicious. I thought Julianne Moore did a respectable job replacing Jodie Foster, but I didn't buy the ""tough woman cop against the world"" act. I'm sure Jodie is not losing sleep over not appearing in Hannibal. One of the best things about SOTL was the sub plots and story intricasies. Hannibal has them, they're just not nearly as interesting. The Verger character is quirky but I never felt sorry for him. The lively dialog between Clarice and Hannibal is almost non-existent. And we are not treated to one scene of Hannibal getting inside someones head (except the Ray Liotta character....literaly) which was what made the character so spooky originally. The special effects and make-up are well done. The music by Hans Zimmer is exceptional and Ridley Scott does a good job of creating an eerie atmosphere. However, those things make for only a good movie, not a great one. 6 out of 10 stars.",Hannibal
362,KrowbOy,"I had a great, gruesome time",9,13 February 2001,"Being a Ridley Scott fan for just about all of my life I was looking forward to Hannibal not only because it was the follow up to Silence of the Lambs but because he made it and did it hold up to my expectations?  The answer is a big fat yes.  The movie will probably get bad reviews from critics and some viewers because of the simple fact that it is the follow up to Silence (like some did last years Blair Witch 2 another good movie).  But if Silence is day then Hannibal is night, they are that different in look, style, and tone.  Most will be wondering if Julianne Moore will be able to fill the role of Clarice Starling after Jodie Foster passed.  Well thats a yes also and I can honestly say that not for a second after Julianne Moore appeared on screen did I think about Jodie Foster.  Granted the Starling character is very different in this movie but it has been 10 years and she's a more mature and broken in character (for lack of better words) but yes also she doesn't have as much to do in this movie and spends a lot of time looking over old photo's and paper's on Lecter.  Anthony Hopkins gives another awesome performance as Hannibal Lecter, but this time Lecter does (in typical hollywood fashion) have those quips that all famous horror characters seem to have.  But thats cool because the character is just as interesting now as he was then.  I won't go into detail about the plot because if you're reading this I'm sure you already know it but it follows the book very close....as close as it needed to in my opinion.  The look of Hannibal is breathtaking but thats always a given in a Ridley Scott movie so we need not go into that except that this movie is very different from Silence in that it's not all gloomy and has the fall season look of Silence, it's sunny and warm (it's set in July anyway) and the Italian locations add a lot for look and atmosphere.  There is even a scene where a thief is stalking Lecter through the streets and they are so crowded and smokey that they brought back memories of the crowded L.A. in Blade Runner.  Gary Oldman stars as Mason Verger the only victim of Lecter's who survived, hidden under Greg Cannom's excellent makeup effects you will never know it's him but still he gives a good performance and shines through.  But Giancarlo Gianinni is the best in the movie except for Mr. Hopkins and the scenes they have together are really good and I really didn't want to see him die. Which brings me to the violence in Hannibal.  When I read Hannibal I said they would never be as graphic as the book but boy was I wrong.  We all know Ridley doesn't shy from the red stuff and it flows here.  Which wasn't a problem for me because I loved every minute of it and I can't think of a movie thats been this bloody except for some with the work of Tom Savini. And people complain about that.  I mean really how the hell can people complain when the movie is about a guy who eats people....go figure.  There are some chilling scenes also like one that plays on a t.v. and shows Hannibal attack a nurse and the one that stood out for me is when Pazzi is at the opera and see's Lecter in the audience and he turns and just stares back at Pazzi.  The ending is different from the book as revealed early on but it is much better and the last part on the plane was really cool.  I don't think Hannibal is as deep as Silence or Manhunter but it was more entertaining and not because it was mainstream because it sure isn't that but it was funny (yes funny Lecter has some great lines) and creepy and even kinda surreal and with the way the characters are drawn kinda Sheakespearian.  I really enjoyed Hannibal and it is now one of my favorite Ridley Scott movies.....a worthy follow up to Gladiator for Mr. Scott and a worthy follow up to Silence of the Lambs....the wait was worth it.",Hannibal
363,pastanley,"Contrived, forgettable.",5,4 August 2001,"Like many sequels which rarely match the original, Hannibal is a pale follow up to Silence of the Lambs, an engrossing movie. Hannibal seems contrived and in true Hollywood fashion, the ending is farcical. Why would the sadistic Dr Hannibal Lecter allow somebody who has been chasing him so long off the hook, and in the most unconvincing fashion.The movie was made to make bucks and is about nothing. Forget it.",Hannibal
364,yucel81x,Oh my god!,7,10 February 2001,"By the time the 2+ hours of this film were done, those were the words I uttered as I watched the rest of the audience walk out with looks that ranged from disgust to apathy to pure enjoyment. This film takes the characters that we have come to know and love from ""Silence of the Lambs"" 10 years ago, and transforms them into something beyond themselves.The role that won Sir Anthony Hopkins his Academy Award is taken to every possible extreme in this examination of his character. He is very clearly having fun with himself in this film, doing everything from testing the audience's mettle for the sick and depraved (let's just leave it to say that it is far gorier than its predecessor) to going to great lengths to make a joke in the most obscene of situations, and he is not afraid to resort to cliches of one-liners and demonic facial gestures to achieve the grim effect of a fright that feels so welcome. In spite of the sickness of Dr. Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lector, there is very much a sense that he is the hero of this film (an anti-hero as it may be, but despite his evil, you find yourself more on his side). Lector is given motivation for his actions, not just the rationalization of killing (eating people) through twisted logic, but there is a sense of understanding his position. We see now that he kills not indiscriminately, but according to a selective set of ethics. The last half-hour of the film is without a doubt some of the most frightening (not just because of the gore but also the performances).Speaking of performances, it is hard to imagine this woman is the same Clarice Starling from ""Silence of the Lambs."" The 10 year history between the two films clearly establishes that Starling has changed in more ways than some would like to believe, and as such Jodie Foster's portrayal, while it would probably be good since there is a background from which she can draw, it would also probably fail simply because there is a distinct difference between the two. The Clarice of the first film is not the same woman here, and as such Julianne Moore does an excellent job in bringing a new perspective to an almost new character. Gary Oldman is pretty incredible two as the horribly disfigured millionaire who happens to be the one survivor of Lector's past onslaughts.Ridley Scott's direction has always been lush in its visual approach, as proven by films like ""Blade Runner,"" ""Alien,"" ""White Squall,"" and his bloodiest movie until this one ""Gladiator."" His use of grim lighting in this film borders on cliche, but it is handled in such a way that the film could not have survived without those very devices.On the whole, ""Hannibal"" is an excellent sequel because it brings new perspectives to characters we already know and love, and it does well to introduce new characters without making them seem extemporaneous or gratuitous. However, the film is certainly not for all tastes. The first hour, while entertaining, relies heavily on the act of detecting and locating Lector before it takes a gross turn in the last hour for the gore-filled chase that continues up until the end of the film. The blood is the least of it, but I won't give it away, you have to see just how disgusting this film gets for yourself. Those with weak stomachs should be ready to throw up and wretch. ""Hannibal"" is a sick movie, but it is a great movie nonetheless. And if you think you can handle it, you won't be disappointed.",Hannibal

366,RockyHorrorFan,Deliciously evil and suspenseful!,10,30 December 2001,"Movie Title: HANNIBAL (2001)Cast: Sir Anthony Hopkins (Dr. Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lecter), Julianne Moore (Clarice M. Starling), Ray Liotta (Paul Krendler), Giancarlo Giannini (Rinaldo Pazzi), Frankie Faison (Barney Matthews), Francesca Neri (Allegra Pazzi), and Gary Oldman (Mason Verger).My Rating: ***1/2 out of **** (3.5 out of 4) Synopsis: After living under an alias in Florence, Italy, Dr. Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lecter decides to hunt down, and reunite with, his old ""friend"", agent Clarice Starling, whom has recently gotten into deep trouble with the FBI. My Review: The world's most psychotic gentleman is back in HANNIBAL, the long-awaited sequel to THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS! Anyone who has ever seen SILENCE... or HANNIBAL knows that no one else can play the sadistic Hannibal Lecter as well as Sir Hopkins. In fact, no one else can even say 'Hello, Clarice..."" with such subtle menace or awkward politeness. Sir Hopkins plays Hannibal as the ultimate villain, and has the Academy Award to prove it. Julianne Moore gives a fabulous and heartfelt performance as Clarice. Unfortunately, she has been subjected to many unfair comparisons to the original Starling, Jodie Foster. In my opinion, it wouldn't be right to compare them because they play the role differently. Although Foster was good in the role, Moore did not want to play the role like Foster, nor did she want to. She has her own interpretation. Ray Liotta, Giancarlo Giannini, and an unrecognizable Gary Oldman offer splendid supporting work, each role being just as big and important as the other. Besides Hopkins, the only returning cast member from the original is Frankie Faison, who does a great job as Barney.I think that the romance between Hannibal and Clarice is very strange, yet touching. They could not be any more different, but they are so perfect for each other. Clarice is very loyal, brave, and smart. Hannibal knows this, which is why he respects and loves her.Director Ridley Scott has done a magnificent job at capturing the beauty of Florence. He also has many other interesting camera tricks up his sleeve.
Scott, screenwriter David Mamet, author Thomas Harris, the cast, and the rest of the creative/productive staff have all done a flawless job in creating a masterful, scary, and gorgeous film!",Hannibal
367,Seamus-25,Very entertaining but don't expect Silence Of The Lambs 2,7,19 February 2001,"Hannibal is a very different film to Silence Of The Lambs and for that reason alone many people won't like it (how many people hated Alien 3 just because it wasn't Aliens part 2). Whereas SOTL was a traditional serial killer flick albeit excellently written and acted - Hannibal is more a black comedy. Hannibal is occasionally very funny with the odd ""bite to eat"" kind of line. It is very gory in parts but this only added to the characterisation - reminding us that although Hannibal is extremely charming - he also has an utter contempt for human life - well rude human life anyway. Clarice Starling's character is not the main focal point of the film and for that reason some people may be a bit disappointed. When she is on screen she seems a little moribund. I am not sure if this is intentional due to the rough ride she is getting in the FBI or because Julianne Moore knew she was facing an impossible task in following in Jodie Foster's footsteps. I believe it is the former.",Hannibal
368,rbylakx,Hannibal... Not a great film/story.,4,27 November 2006,"I totally dislike stories that are not plausible. Lecter came back to America to ""help"" Starling out with her dilemma regarding her suspension. Like he could really do anything. It makes more sense for him to have returned because of his ""love"" for her. Which he is. Now the infamous ""dinner scene"" was just an insult to my intelligence. First off, he ""fixes"" up Clarice and her bullet wound. Fine. Gave the appropriate drugs to help her pain and healing. She wakes up and finds, very nice and neat, on the desk all her stuff. Cuffs, money...etc. Too convenient. Lecter disconnects the phone because he knew Clarice's nature would be to try to call the police. Why did he not just rip the phone off the wall to ensure no outside intruders? He just disconnected it where a child could put it together very easily. Clarice make the call to the cops and that limits Lecter from having ""quality"" time with her, which he has been aching to have. Remember, he does love her in his own sick way. He literally has only minutes to be with her before he has to escape. WHY? He is so smart and in love with her. He would never let that happen where she would call for help. He wants to eat the guy's brain and talk with Clarice. If he is to convince her to love him, without the use of drugs, he needs TIME...period. Time he did not allow himself to have.Now the cops are on their way. Time is short. He traps her with her hair and the fridge and ask if she could ever love him. The OBVIOUS answer is NO, NO, NO. Why would she? Dumb on Lecter's part. Makes no sense. He needed time and or drugs to get his way with Clarice. So he can hear the answer he longs for. If ""no"" is the obvious answer, maybe he never should of come to America, but I will talk about that in detail a little later in this writing. Let me go back a little now.In ""The Silence of the Lambs"", the thing that I liked a lot about Jodie Foster's performance is that she was respectful of Lecter but, immensely afraid of him. Even between 6 to 10 inches of glass or steel bars separating them. She feared Lecter, which made me fear Lecter. Watch the movie again and see what I mean. Total fear yet controlled and respectful. I was scared every time she spoke with him. In ""Hannibal"", Clarice is actually face to face with her worst nightmare and totally unafraid. This guy would in a second eat your face off and she attacks him like he is the bully neighbor you grew up with. She was drugged, I understand, but she was relentless the whole time. If a big dog chased me and I had a gun, I am brave because of the weapon yet I still would be afraid. The foreign cop guy in the beginning of the movie was afraid of him but, very greedy and it cost him his life. Clarice tried to get him with a knife and fist and then cuffs. She was relentless. It made me not afraid of Lecter. We all should be. He is capable of ANYTHING.Finally, Lecter escapes by mere moments from the police, minus one left hand. We are talking moments. Seconds. He is on the 10 most wanted list. Everyone in America is after him. All the airports have his picture, the state line, the damn Mexican border. His likeness is out there plus the now distinguishing mark of a missing left hand. Yet, he is able to board a plane for overseas, no problem. I am to assume he is on the plane days later after the dinner scene. It's not like he was in hiding for a while to let the ""heat"" die down. No disguise and no left hand to the airport for a flight overseas. I defy you to walk across the street after robbing the local 7-11 or gas station, and get you hand cut off and be able to board a plane for anywhere. STUPID, STUPID, STUPID. That part makes no sense. Even if he dressed like a priest, all people with casts, or splints, or missing left hands would be questioned by airport officials.I like the beginning of the movie. It's after he arrived to America, the movie goes downhill. Keep the story simple consistent to real life regardless of the extreme circumstances.",Hannibal
369,Wolf30x,"Artfully done, and stands alone.",9,31 March 2001,"I think the people seeing this movie are broken down mainly into three groups: those who saw Silence of the Lambs, those who read the novel, and those for whom this is their first exposure to Hannibal. For those of you who saw the prequel, while this is a great movie, you should know going in that the story is done differently than the previous film. Where Silence of the Lambs focused more on the character Clarice Starling, as the title would suggest, the focus of this story is Hannibal. Also the settings aren't as dark, but still the film definetly packs the suspense of its predecessor. Oddly enough it uses humor in a rather intriguing manner in some of the more tense scenes that don't relieve the tension as much as it does intensify it. Those of you who read the novel won't be dissapointed. In some ways its more refined than the novel, but in some ways it does lack. Its more refined in the sense that the plot is more streamlined, and the pace of the story feels faster than the novel. For example some of the less crucial characters, (such as Verger's sister) are either removed, or their roles were edited down in the story. However while this gets the plot going, it also hinders character development. So while Mason Verger seems evil, doesn't appear as evil as you know he is, Starling doesn't take as big a fall from grace as the book shows, and Hannibal doesn't seem as much of an anti-hero as he used to. However, you will definitely find the ending intriguing. Now for those of you who haven't read any of the novels or seen the movies, well you're in for a treat. Don't worry, the plot of the story stands enough on its own that you won't be confused from not knowing what happened before. Hopkins once again delivers an excellent performance as Hannibal, and as does Julianne Moore as Agent Starling. Ridley Scott's directing is simply amazing. The scenes are all beautifully filmed, (yes i know thats an odd word choice for a movie about a serial killer, but from Florence to Washington, every shot is simply breathtaking.) The score is equally amazing, and makes exceptional use out of the operatic peace that is heavily used. This film has two of the most intense scenes I have ever seen filmed, which even though they get a bit gruesome, you won't want to close your eyes for fear of missing what's going to come next. This film is definetly one to see.",Hannibal
370,leliorisen,Welcome to Camp Gore,7,11 February 2001,"Audience response is a good way to gauge this film. In the packed house in Chelsea (Manhattan) on opening night, the main reaction was laughter to the assortment of Hopkins' 1-lecters (oops, make that 1-liners) that were sprinkled throughout. The other noticeable reaction was the audible wincing that took place at several points, most notably at the onset of the climactic skull-opening.There was not a particular sense of horror or dread that built up with the film, though there were plenty of spots where one has a hard time staring at the screen. While gore has been more frequent and more gruesome in other films, it is the campy staging of the gore that is the trademark of Hannibal.This is one of those films to see for the 2 or 3 scenes that will be discussed at the water cooler. If you are looking for a satisfying thriller in the Silence Of The Lambs mode, you're bound to be disappointed.It certainly wasn't boar-ing. However, I also didn't find it to be a rip.",Hannibal
371,scubergmu,Too many problems to count,5,19 February 2001,"This movie had so many things wrong with I'm not sure where to begin.  The biggest flaw in my mind is simply that Anthony Hopkins wasn't scary as Hannibal Lector in this one.  In The Silence of the Lambs he was like a wickedly intelligent, caged animal who'd strike horribly if given any opportunity, not necessarily to escape prison, but just because he was a psychopath. In Hannibal, as a free man he spends almost all of the movie just being a normal person, attending shows, working, travelling, drinking his Espressos, etc, and there's just nothing intense or creepy about any of it.  Given the fact that Anthony Hopkins is also visibly a decade older and a good bit heavier than he was in the original, he seems rather harmless, just like any guy you'd pass on the street.Another somewhat major problem with Hannibal is that the plot was really lacking. It seemed as though the events of the movie were just an excuse to reunite us with the two characters.  You do have to appreciate the lengths with which the film=makers went to, to make sure that every person killed in the movie was done so in some uniquely, and often outrageously gruesome way. But what left me the most disappointed however, was the fact that director decided to scrap the book's somewhat cool, albeit far-out ending in favor of... basically no ending at all.  What they gave us here as far as I can tell, didn't answer anything, didn't resolve anything, didn't sum anything up. The movie just kind of stopped going after two hours and they rolled the credits.Hannibal the movie was totally style over substance, almost a complete reversal from The Silence of the Lambs.  Here again, we have a highly anticipated sequel that costs about 8 times as much, but totally doesn't live up to the original in terms of the finer points, like possessing a little meaning, depth, or intensity.",Hannibal
372,Daelock,"Sequel falls short of other two flicks, but is decent",6,23 December 2002,"A friend of mine summed this movie up best, referring to why it doesn't have the same impact as Silence of the Lambs or Red Dragon: ""It's all about the gore.""(he used a different word for gore, but it would give away part of the the ending to use it here) and it's true, that is what this movie is ALL about. In Silence we saw a man clearly tormented by his own inner demons to do such despicable acts for such a twisted reason. In Red Dragon, a man's hideous past with his grandmother forces him into a spiral of shame and guilt that manifests in a very bizarre and frightening way. In Hannibal...it's all about the gore. Even the 'villain's'(since Lecter cannot be called the villain, but the lesser of two evils)reasons for what he's doing is filled with blood and gore. His method is full of hideous gore. Hannibal's scenes are all very messy but these movies have always been violent and graphic, but with the other two there seemed to be far more method to it all and it always went into great detail into the psychoses of these men to see why, why they did this atrocious things. With this, it's understood and it's given and there's very little psychology to it. Is it a bad movie? Certainly not. Hopkins gives, as always, a brilliant performance as the cold and calculating Dr. Lecter. Julianne Moore fills the shoes of Jodie Foster playing Clarice Sterling, but simply can't come up with the same look or intensity as Foster could. Still, too many people blame the movie's downfall on her, because she's an easy target(she's NEW and FOREIGN in the movie series! Cue the demonic hiss) but she does an able job. The fault can't be squarely placed on one thing, but a combination of things because no ONE thing in this movie is truly lacking, but nothing is as powerful as the others were. This movie is NOT for the squeamish or the faint of heart, it gets INCREDIBLY messy, but it's worth seeing at least once.",Hannibal

Julianne Moore takes over for Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling and she does pretty good , allthough I prefered Foster.Unlike Silence of The Lambs the emphasis seems to be more towards violence rather than suspense which makes this one less effective than Silence .

374,mynystry,disappointing,6,27 June 2008,"well, i saw silence of the lambs since long time ago, and i thought it was a good film, but not MAGNIFICENT, as many labeled. The thing i disliked the most about it was the end, when Buffalo Bill could have easily killed agent Starling but in a classic Hollywood move something near to impossible happened and at the very last millisecond the good guys won. however I was quiet impressed with the central character in that movie, besides Sterling... yes, I mean by Dr. Hannibal Lecter.Many years passed and only until now I saw the ""sequel"" Hannibal. I am not sure why I waited so much to see it, when actually I've heard many people talk good about it but I didn't care about it. Only till now that the fourth part came out I decided to see all of the films again, starting with the Silence of the Lambs, which left me exactly the same impression as before, and now Hannibal, which actually was a little bit of a disappointment.The film goes more into the fiction realm, where Dr. Lecter transform from being a cannibal into a super-cannibal. He gets super powers, super strength, stealth movement. Some scenes remind me of the suspense you feel while watching Aliens; Scott's masterpiece.I must say the film is not completely bad, there are some good scenes, which fulfill their purpose of shocking the audience. Good examples are the hanging of judas, the pigs eating their dinner, and maybe a little bit too exaggerating the brainz scene. But these are mixed in between with too many Hollywood flaws, as the rambo scene at the beginning of the movie, the super-cannibal-man speed and stealth, and the worst: Agent Starling, waking up after days in comma, and walking down the stairs without taking off her high heels...Silence of the lambs was simpler, and that's what made it better.",Hannibal

It qualifies for the definition of pornography in that all the plot was simply a device to allow the violent gruesome titillating scenes. No character development occurred, no moral agenda was pursued (other than rudeness (or inadequate culture) should be savagely punished, and the florentine/religious backdrop was a spurious cover for visual violence.Many ""video nasties"" had more thought and development and, as we saw with Emmanuelle, a large budget and good cinematography do not stop a film lacking substance or avoid it being distasteful.",Hannibal

The book was excellent, screenplay a good adaption and the casting was spot on.Julianne Moore filled Jodie Fosters shoes perfectly and showed that she is not just a very pretty face.  Hopkins again excelled as the monsterous Lecter and there were some nice set pieces involving effective splashes of blood for all the family.Although the story ran well, there were some holes that only people who have read the book will be able to put together, ie why Verger had the wild pigs in the first place and the lead up to the plan. The score was stimulating and fitted the visuals, and the feeling was very different from Silence.  I thought this was a good thing, because as successful as Silence was, I don't think that todays audience wanted more of exactly the same.  Ridley Scott should be pleased.

377,cgfry,The sum is less than the parts.,8,27 April 2002,"There is a lot to like about this movie.  The sound track and the Florence settings are absolutely fabulous.  Anthony Hopkins is still wonderfully creepy extreme.  Julianne Moore is good enough to make us (almost) forget about Jodie Foster.  The cinematography is exceptional.  The special effects are not overdone, and extremely well done where needed.  They provide the punch for a few unforgettable scenes.    The problem:  the story.  It just doesn't go anywhere.  There is no build up of mystery, no growing suspense.  The DVD deleted scenes suggest Ridley was aware of these problems, and just couldn't resolve them.  Other glaring problems exist.  Hannibal is caught way too easily.  Clarice is uninteresting in the extreme in the first half of the movie.  The ending with Hannibal and Clarice didn't work for me (I just don't believe Hannibal would be so easily trapped, and didn't really believe the solution he took to escape).  All in all, a beautifully made, wasted movie.",Hannibal
378,mhsvikings,Tons of fun,10,20 November 2002,"This movie is a lot of fun. There are some creepy gorey scenes that are almost over the top, but it really holds your attention. The characters in this movie are great, especially Inspector Pazzi and Mason Verger. I have never read the novel but I can't imagine it being any more entertaining than this movie.

379,bamatommy,Don't waste your money.,1,5 July 2003,This movie was dreadful.  The best part of the movie was when the credits rolled;  I knew my suffering was over.  The only thing this movie had was gore.  It didn't keep me in suspense.  It didn't scare me.  It made me want to vomit.,Hannibal
380,sean73267326,An initial disappointment that gets better with time.,8,8 July 2015,"If ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a thriller played liked a character-study, then ""Hannibal"" is a character-study played like a thriller. This isn't a good point, or a bad point (it goes both ways), but it's the most clear observation I could make out when I watched this film again recently. Another realization I came to was that, despite not really liking it on first viewing, this is actually a very good movie - one more deeply creepy, violent, and sad.The plot lies more or less on the same level as the previous film. Hannibal is now free, Starling is disgraced after a scandal with the FBI, and an old victim of Hannibal's contacts her with a proposal to trap him once and for all. Things go awry, chaos ensues. The performances are just as brilliant as the original, and that goes a long way to helping the (slightly over-the-top) story stick together. The thing is, it's a completely different movie, which is probably why I and many others didn't like it upon release. Gone is the tension of the first movie, replaced instead by a much more potent sense of paranoia and dread - mostly down to Hannibal's new found freedom. Also new to this movie is the blood and gore that it's so infamous for. It did feature in the original, but not like this. This is an exceptionally violent movie, and features one of the sickest, nastiest scenes in the history of mainstream cinema (you know which one I'm talking about).Unlike other movies, though, the violence means a lot here. Sure, it's gross and icky and what have you, but more than anything, the nastiness reveals a lot about its characters that the original film didn't touch on. Unlike the original, this isn't a film that particularly likes Hannibal - here, he's not the endearingly-creepy movie-monster, but he's an utter psychopath. This is bound to put some people off, but it feels like the natural thing for this film to do. Does it go too far? Possibly. Some things never need to be shown, but it's all integral to the film's vision so it gets a free pass... just about. As for the film being a drama played like a thriller, that does mean it loses the probing character-based drama of the original. Starling's story in the original is so raw on screen that it practically bleeds - this film deals with similarly prickly affairs, but never really addresses them. The knock-on effect is that it ends up being a less involving film, but a more exciting one. Again, this isn't really a good point or a bad point, but it's more just a point of comparison. Don't come into Hannibal expecting the virtuosic drama of the original.What ultimately saves Hannibal (the reason I've given it an 8) is the grand, darkly romantic vision it commits to. It's a sweeping, perfectly orchestrated film that feels as if it's what could have been made if film existed at the height of the romantic era. The sets are some of the most lavish to ever grace the crime-thriller genre (most of it is set in Florence), the music exists solely in the realms of opera and classical, and the plot, flawed as its logic sometimes is, hits every note with an intensity lacking in most crime movies. It's all fantastically realized.In the end, it's not the perfect sequel to Silence of the Lambs. Some may find it too gory (yours truly included), and that's a fair comment. The plot enters a territory that will probably aggravate some, and that's also a fair criticism. If you can come into it realizing it's a different film to the first, however, you may ultimately end up finding a lot to like.",Hannibal
381,gimmeDV,"A newcomer to ""Silence"" sequence",3,11 February 2001,"Well, 1st off I haven't seen ""Silence of the Lambs"" yet.... but, I think that I would have become sick if I would have seen it before this piece. Not from the gruesome violence but, from the lack of everything else. Anthony Hopkins was very good as Hannibal and I really believed that he was as psychotic as he played himself off to be but, from the reaction of the audience around me, the film was filled with cliches from ""Silence"" which left me lost at points where others were laughing at what was on the screen.Now, I heard that the movie would be very gruesome and if the director wanted to gross folks out... he did it... but, only in 2 sequences? I mean, if you want it to be gruesome and I mean, so gruesome that you're going to play the film off of that... you need more than 2 sequences.. I always see it as a film has to either become that cinematic jewel which will ultimatley take you to another place and time or either go over the top (which most of the time is done in bad taste). But, this film left me sitting in my chair and falling asleep at times. Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore are the stars of the movie, right? Well, with the exception of Hopkins, I didn't feel that way.. Who cared about the stupid Italian police officer? I definatley didn't. So, really the film is left with a big hole talking about a guy who dies anyway. I mean, come on.. who cares?In a nutshell, the movie is good if you want to see Lector and Starling once again but, if you're going for a really good thriller... you'll jump once and be grossed out maybe twice. Depends on your level.
Thinking about how much money this movie will bring in... there will probably be another ""Hannibal"" made and this movie probably won't be on video until the fall. If you must see it.. wait and save the $3.50 - $4.00 and get it on video. Don't spend the big bucks on this film.",Hannibal

I'll just keep mine short and sweet.  Writing-Poor.  Plot-Unbelievable.  Acting-Paint by numbers.  The only thing that this movie has to make it stand out is the gore factor, and that's the only thing you'll remember about it 10 years from now.  However, I remember so many details from ""Silence Of The Lambs"".  I would suggest that you rent that again, it's a much better use of your time if you want to visit with Hannibal again.",Hannibal
383,m.p.,Stylish ambiance with over the top gore..,10,6 October 2001,"Having heard so many negative comments about the gore in this movie, I was surprised at the stylish ambiance, elegant settings, witty dialog and beautiful sound track - they contrasted well with the horror of the story. There's an interesting subplot of the avaricious Italian policeman trying to collect the reward money so he can keep his beautiful young wife happy (she'd like better seats at the opera next time, thank you very much!)  The gore really is pretty much over the top but if you watch TV shows that show actual hospital operations, you can probably handle it.  The ending was a surprise in many ways and reveals Lector's apparent feelings toward Clarice Starling, a true FBI ""Untouchable.""  As for the final scene, don't parents tell kids not to talk to strangers (and strange people) anymore?  Fast paced and outrageous, let it stand on its own without comparison to the original.",Hannibal
384,Matt-162,"Technically, Great. Overall? Bad...",5,12 February 2001,"A lifelong fan of Ridley Scott, I went to see this ill-attempted addition to the Lecter series despite my better judgement. I had heard the book was largely exploitive of the character and over the top. The movie followed suit. The story is simple: Starling is disgraced during a failed FBI raid. Lecter catches reference to this whilst in hiding in Italy and begins to contact her. Discovered by an Italian detective, Lecter is soon back to his grizzly murderous ways and we are taken on a downhill slope of gorey killings that approach a cartoonish quality in their unique nature.
The film is as beautiful as you would expect from Ridley Scott. Technically, this is exactly what you would want. Dark, gritty and full of shadows. The Zimmer score is beautiful in its mischievious evil subtlety. The acting is very good - the most notable performance by Gary Oldman. Hopkins performs his Lecter character with an almost parody style, giving the movie an awkward comedy feel. I didn't think this was successful...Lecter is hardly a character one can comfortably empathize with. The movie tries to take a more sympathetic look at him...describing his victims as criminals or ""rude"" people, yet also shows him biting a nurse's face in beastial fashion at the same time. No sympathy here, speaking for myself. The movie ends somewhat abruptly and fails to encompass the length of the novel from what I understand. Nothing is tied up...it has an unfinished feel to it. As a fellow viewer pointed out to me, the movie is little more than a B-movie with A list players. For those seeking a Lecter gore-fest, enjoy! For those seeking story and the suspense of Hannibal's predecesor...give this one a pass.",Hannibal
385,Muskox53,Fine film of a very fine book—EXCEPT for the last 10 minutes!,7,4 June 2016,"Hopkins is excellent, though he does run the risk of recycling the part into cliché. Moore is very good, with an impossible job—standing in for Foster. Giannini is wonderful, as always. Everyone else is okay...though when the bad guys are stupid, they are astonishingly stupid!The problem is the horrible, nonsensical rewrite they foisted on the end of the book. The plot systematically removes all of the people who support and care for Starling, so that the only relationship she is left with is Leckter. She saves him, gets shot, he saves her...and then...nothing comes of it, at least in the movie. (Probably the producers or the studio assumed that the audience would hate an ending in which they ran off together...so they gave us idiocy instead. Or rather just bad writing.) If you think about it, what other possible outcome of their relationship can there be? And what happens to the careful preparation for this ending that the rest of the book/film provides? Nonsense!!It has been revealed that David Mamet wrote an early draft of the screenplay, but it was rejected. Can we speculate that perhaps he preserved the book's ending? (I have no idea one way or the other...)But up to that terrible ending (Leckter chops his own hand off—seriously!!?), it's a decent film. Simplifies the plot too much (I really miss Verger's sister, but guess she had to go...), but A- for the first 90%. Then, I simply have to turn it off!",Hannibal
386,frontrow99,Forget the gore.. there is no gore... forget the sequel nonsense... this is not a sequel,10,23 February 2001,"Why is it that each and every critis tends to compare 'Hannibal' with 'The Silence of the Lambs'? Okay, I can see the reasons, but they are too obvious. Both movies are about Starling and Lecter and both were based on a Thomas Harris Novel. But why don't they see that these are two separate movies? The story takes place about 7 years after 'The Silence of the Lambs'. It's a different time and a different director. Demme very much focused on the close-ups and on suggestion, Scott focused more on explicity. But I think Scott really held back in a very good way. The movie was far less gory than all the critics claimed it to be. Don't forget 'The Silence of the Lambs' doesn't refrain from gory details, like the dead body hanging on Lecter's cell, the cut-off face, the autopsy-scene and Jame Gumb's skills as a couturier. 'Hannibal' was not more or less gory. It was of the same calibre.'Hannibal' is a different movie in oh so many ways. Lecter is on the loose now and we simply miss the suspense of him being captured and still dangerous. Scottis very often being blamed for this lack of supsense but the man can't help it. If there's anyone to blame then blame Thomas Harris. But it would've been an almost exact copy of 'The Silence of the Lambs' and that would have been boring.Julianne Moore was absolutely breath-taking. Some people said she was too good as an actress to play Starling. I disagree. She is more mature than Foster. She's not Foster, she's the Clarice of the present. And Hopkins is Lecter, although he describes is as just a part. He carries the movie and provides some of the best scenes I have seen in a long time with a dark whimsical type of sarcasm and irony. He stays within the limits of parody and could have provided himself with a much easier job by simply copying the lines of 'The Silence of the Lambs'. He doesn't. He adds new things to his character. The movie adds new things to his character. One of the most unpleasant things (that I personally did not like) was the fact his sexuality is questions several times. We already get confused in the Mason Verger flash-back scene and he acts rather gay when he meets commendatore Pazzi while holding his cigar.Gary Oldman also deserves credit just as Giancarlo Giannini. The latter is rather impressive making his character human rather than a charicature.Zimmer's musical score is breath-taking and very effective and so is Patrick Cassidy's mini-opera, 'Vide Cor Meum'. And what was most striking about 'Hannibal' in general was its stunning Cinematography. Was 'The Silence of the Lambs' rather dark, 'Hannibal' is warm. It's not just Florence giving the movie its touch it's Scott's feeling for image (his trademark). The movie's opening credits are very original, reminding me a bit of David Fincher's 'Se7en'.Now is there anything negative to mention about this movie? Yes there is. It is far less creepy than 'The Silence of the Lambs', but as I mentioned before: it is a different movie. The movie very faithfully sticks to the novel. And I thought the beginning of the movie, let's say the first 30-40 minutes was pretty messy. The scenes are too short and being switched too often to really make an impression. The movie's first big scene, the drugbust at the fishmarket was quite messy also but it was a good opener anyway.All in all a very good movie, with the occasional let down. I loved the shot of the lamb however. That is a merit of the movie: it refers to 'The Silence of the Lambs' but it doesn't overrefer to it... it has its own identity. And the dinner scene: I am so glad they kept it in the movie (I guess everyone knows by now): it is one of the most amazing things I have ever seen... perfect!",Hannibal

But this film just proves that a good film must begin with a great story.  I had hopes for Julianne Moore in the role of Clarice (even though my heart's tendency is to cry out for Jodie), but there was so little character development or exploration of her in ""Hannibal"" she might as well have been non-existant.  The return of Anthony Hopkins should have been the sole basis for bringing out the backstory exhibited in the novel... yet the audience is thrown dark comedic lines rather than a clear explanation for why he is what he is. I can only hope that the adaptation of Harris' novels will stop here as it is clear that only Jonathon Demme possess the artistic vision to create such a ghastly and beautiful cinematic treat.",Hannibal

This is true in a way as there is not that much suspense in this movie; the last scene with Julianne Moore calling the police in no match for Jodie Foster being stuck in the dark with Buffalo Bill in Silence of the Lambs.  But Hannibal still has a lot going for it.  Moore is as good as anyone could be as Clarice, Hopkins is great, albeit less scary than in the last film.  Also, it is not just a sequel but a RIDLEY SCOTT movie, with the same amazing jerky Saving Private Ryan style camerawork in the action scenes that was used in Gladiator (sorry I can't remember the cinematographer's name, but he's sure to get an Oscar this year).  And if the ending had been left the same as in the book then it just wouldn't have worked on screen. Not a classic, but a good, enjoyable thriller.  8/10",Hannibal

Also, Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling was a surprise, unexpectedly good as a replacement for Jodie Foster.This films greatest failing, and something which is unforgivable, is the fact that English was spoken among the Italians instead of more obvious Italian.  This points out in no subtle way that ""Hannibal"" is a film made for and by Americans, those that can not stand cultural or linguistic barriers.  This, to me, was glaringly obvious, and I was especially glad when the Florentine scenes were over, and language difference was no longer a spot on an otherwise spotless film.",Hannibal
390,Michael Laing,"Maybe the most boring film of all time, at least close",4,27 February 2001,"Oh, wow is me. What a pity, Ridley Scott is one of the most talented people on the planet.  He has made some of the most artful and stylish movies of all time. but there is a fine line between artful and boring and with this film, Scott has crossed that line.  From his first film The Duellist we can see that Ridley Scott has alway had an exceptional talent for creating beautiful and stylish films but this film had become to sanitised because of it.  Silence of the Lambs had a raw edge to it that could put you on the edge of your seat.  Unfortunately, Hannibal doesn't.There is nothing wrong with the acting but Anthony Hopkins has aged a lot since the first film and has lost the believability that he had.  Julie Anne Moore take over the role Starling well and Garry Oldman is quite gruesome as Mason Verger although his make up looked a little to fake at times.  I must commend Giancarlo Giannini for his performance which I thought was the best in the film.The biggest problem with this film is the story which is just to unbelievable and the adapted screenplay that ruins the film.  The dialogue is tiresome and uneven and the end product of this is a complete shamble of a film.  The Film tries to be humorous but fails terribly.  What is really bad though is how distasteful the film is!  I wouldn't have minded if the film had been done well and was funny but it just leaves a bad taste in the mouth in this case.I do advise people to see this film but only because I'm a sadist and want to see people suffer.

Had I seen the the terrifing original, I would have expected much more.  Before seeing this, my older sister (who is a HUGE fan of the Hannibal Lecter books and movies) said she was disapointed by the ending.

393,prestonm1993,The Masterclass Actors Need,10,14 September 2018,"Without spoiling the story in this introduction, I will simply state that what makes the Anthony Hopkins trilogy of Hannibal Lector films so great is that there are always a minimum of two villains. The first being the titular Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lector. The second being a ""Villain of the Week"". Silence of the Lambs featured ""Buffalo Bill"" as the second (but not necessarily secondary) antagonist, and Red Dragon features the ""Tooth Fairy"" in the same role. This is what I always admire about the ""Hannibal Lector"" franchise. This film also has a strong, compitent female lead filling in very tough shoes.Anthony Hopkins, of course, reprises Dr. Hannibal Lector. But Jodie Foster was not able to return to the role, so Julianne Moore fills in the role and brings her own unique portrayal that is not necessarily a drastic difference beyond the realm of human possibility. 10 years have changed FBI Agent Clarice Starling
as have the casting department, but it works. Paul Krendler returns from a cameo in the first film into a trouble-making foil to Clarice, this time portrayed by Ray Liotta. Joining the cast in the role of the aforementioned ""second villain"" is Gary Oldman's chilling portrayal of Mason Verger, a former pedophile who became Dr. Lector's only surviving victim... surviving with a horrible disfigurement and broken neck which left him paralyzed from the neck down.The film opens with Mason Verger buying information on the loose Lector, and a botched raid lead by Clarice. This raid leads Verg er to contact her in the hopes of leading Lector back to America, so the Dr. can face his (Verger's) horrible vengeance while Lector seeks to ""come back (to the) public life"".",Hannibal

Changes were made however with the director and leading lady. Veteran Ridley Scott replaced Johnathan Demme as director and Julianne Moore replaced Jodie Foster. Jodie Foster not reprising her Oscar winning role surprised and actually disappointed me a bit considering she's my favourite actress but I have to say Julianne Moore was really good in her place as the FBI agent. Its wrong to compare as to who was better because Moore played the part on a different behalf. Ridley Scott is an excellent director and really gave the film a different look, still that same thrill and erieness but with the European scenery and the chilling score from Hans Zimmer, Scott truly made this film a different colour in comparison to the Silence. The one real problem with this film is the separation between Hopkins and Moore throughout a majority of the film unlike in the Silence in which Foster engaged in conversations with Hopkins that made the film so memorable. Its very different in this film. So don't compare it to the Silence. It's still a terrific feature with a thrilling story that kept me glued to my seat until the shocking ending.",Hannibal
395,jmcsween90,The Screaming of the Hams,4,25 May 2001,"I'm having an old friend for dinner.' It seems as if Dr. Lector should have eaten alone. Sometimes sequels are merited and sometimes classics should be left intact. The Silence of the Lambs' was screaming out for a second installment, but when Jonathan Demme and Jodie Foster turned their noses up at Thomas Harris' novel alarm bells should have started ringing.The film which takes place a decade after the original sees Hannibal running riot in Florence while Clarice licks her wounds as a disgraced FBI agent back in America. One thing leads to another, and before you know it Lector is once again being pursued by a bunch of crooked cops, and wide eyed Feds. Throw in a few subplots concerning victims bent on revenge, man eating pigs, and other absurd diversions and there lies the essence of this mess of a movie.The problem with Hannibal' is that it had a hard act to follow. The fact that it didn't make the slightest effort to hold a torch to its predecessor makes matters far worse. Anthony Hopkins exudes none of the charm or terror that made his character in the first film into a cultural icon. Julianne Moore is cold and unsympathetic, lacking all the cunning and vulnerability of Foster's Clarice. For the screen's greatest bad guy to be reduced to the role of a clown in this freak show is a sad reflection on Ridley Scott's talents, but judging by what he had to work with it seems as if the blame doesn't rest solely with him. The original novel on which the script was based was just deplorably bad and after that everything was going to fall apart.On its own terms Hannibal' is neither thrilling, funny, or dramatic, and it is riddled with flat performances. When viewed in the light of its predecessor it is an abysmal mess. Hopkins is just a shadow of his former self, and Moore simply doesn't have the presence of Jodie Foster. But at the end, one inescapable remains: Lector was infinitely more terrifying when he was behind bars. Let the cannibal out of the bag and the suspense goes with it.",Hannibal

So why did Harris have to go and ruin a perfectly good story by throwing Clarice Starling back in to the mix? Now, I'm not saying this because I thought Starling wasn't absolutely essential to the success of 'The Silence of the Lambs,' but in 'Hannibal,' it just so happens that the stronger part of the movie is the interplay between corrupt Italian cop, Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini) and Anthony Hopkins (Hannibal). Here was where we got to see Hannibal at his cold, unemotional and intellectual best as he led Pazzi down the garden path, always one step ahead of him. The whole movie could have focused on this - Lecter teasing his prey. As for Starling... You could have left her out of it entirely and she wouldn't have been missed because the Italian story line was so strong. All that shines for the last hour is that Starling is weak and pathetic and appears to have been thrown into the mix because Silence of the Lambs demanded it. Moore tried, although I didn't think she was as wonderful as Jodie Foster, but you can't escape that Starling wasn't a bit superflous to the film. The net result is by the end, you can't wait for it all to be over and the gore-fest is all a bit anticlimatic and seems thrown in because Hannibal is a Cannibal, not Hannibal is a ruthless, cold-blooded murderer , which was probably more the emphasis in SOTL...

So I admit that I approach the movie adaptations from a different angle than the non reading movie consumer. Having said that, I did not like all parts of the movie version of Silence of the Lambs. The book carries a much more complex story and I clearly did not like the way Agent Starling was portrayed by Jodie Foster. The Agent Starling in the book is self assured, cool, fast with her gun and a very tough women, not the trembling wreck we see in the dark cellar with her gun shaking like a lambs tail.So I was pleasantly surprised to see the movie adaptation of Hannibal. Here Julianne Moore is indeed the Agent Starling from the book. While the book is for people who know the difference between fois gras and liverwurst, who enjoy the description of a Florentine palazzo, without skipping pages to look for the next FBI shootout scene, the movie caters more for the mainstream audience, who could not stomach a cannibal turned Lecter loving Starling.In general, Hannibal is a much closer adaptation of the Thomas Harris novel than SILENCE. I was afraid Ridley Scott would leave out most of the Florence part, but he did not! He gave this part real spirit, with a wonderful musical score and beautiful cinematography. The only difference is the END. This infamous, ghastly, shocking, disgusting, disturbing, brain eating, I-want-you-to-keep-an-open-mind end. If you liked SILENCE you probably have known the story of Hannibal anyway (unless you immigrated to Mars two years ago). Here the movie is totally different. In fact the movie tells a different story than the book. Maybe the producers wanted to impress the audience with their medical knowledge, that cannibalism of central nervous tissue is a health hazard for the species (BSE crisis in Europe!).
After the release of the book, many readers felt cheated (like many movie watchers here). But what on earth did you expect? Agent Starling chasing Dr. Lecter up and down the USA before she finally nails him down? Lecter locked away in a maximum security prison and Starling visiting him once a year with a bottle of Chateau Petrus? What sort of (happy) end do some here possibly have in mind? Also I keep wondering: Where have all the people been over the last two years (since the release of the novel) who are now completely shocked about this ending? I just cannot believe true fans of SILENCE waited all this time until the book was squeezed into a movie (Like: I waited all this years, finally queued up for hours for a ticket, enjoyed the movie very much and then THIS DISGUSTING ENDING!) Can't you people read?Precisely because so many people here seem to be convinced that they are more competent to direct a sequel than Ridley Scott, the story line and the plot are brilliant. The weakest part is the typical shoot out in the beginning, The film gets better with every minute. Hannibal Lecter as the curator of a museum, as the keeper and preserver of medieval Italian culture may not be striking to the mainstream audience. But the book and the movie are not for the ignorant. If you expect to be educated by Harris, you are mistaken. Go and read about Dantes Inferno before you read or watch the Florence chapters. Here Harris is as arrogant in his knowledge as Umberto Eco. If you find this part boring, you either bought the wrong ticket or you are not educated enough to understand it. It is one of the best scenes when Lecter lectures on Judas and Dante as a warning to the Italian inspector what will be the reward for greed and treason.The ending obviously is disturbing. But if you do not want to be disturbed by Hannibal Lecter, why did you bother to watch the movie? Everybody should know the movie is about a cannibal: So please do not be surprised if he behaves like one. There is enough proof here among the reviews, that Lecter got into the mind of everybody. If you hate the ending, wouldn't that be the emotion Hannibal Lecter would indulge in?",Hannibal

My husband and I went,he fell asleep 20 minutes into the film. It was horrible for the first hour. Dragging on...and ......on...... with Julianne Moore TRYING to fill Jodie Fosters shoes. (Not a Chance). Finally after Dr. Lecter comes back to the US does it get a little better. Needless to say, I feel alot of money was wasted making this film. Lets just hope there isn't a THIRD movie!

405,Marx Marvelous,Hopkins is fun too watch against this sheet of mediocrity,6,4 September 2001,"Frankly, I didn't get nearly as excited about Silence of the Lambs like everybody else did when it was released. I found that flick to be a very average suspense thriller with decent performances by Foster and Hopkins. But I can't remember much from it, which is a good way to tell how good I think it was.Anyway, this follow-up was fairly pointless. I couldn't have cared less about Agent Starling - she was about as interesting as a chalk sandwich.And as much as I am perversly interested in stories involving cannibalism, I'm not a big fan of movies that attempt to get us to root for the villain. Yes, Hannibal is a suave, likeable gentleman on the surface, but he deserves to be tortured for dozens of years then killed for the crimes he committed.And so we rooted for him, and he got away... ...so we can get another pointless sequel, hooray.6/10",Hannibal

I have to admit, I didn't like the MANHUNTER but I enjoyed SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. The actors are great and the filming location in Venice is marvelous.

408,conners76,"Never mind where Lecter is pitching up next.....if they go ahead with plans to make another sequel, I'm leaving the country.",4,18 September 2001,"The serial killer is a rather predictable figure. Reliable psychological profiles have repeatedly pointed the way to pathetic, inadequate individuals who can never hope to recover any semblance of self esteem, instead turning their self-hatred upon society. Not so the eponymous anti-hero of Ridley Scott's Hannibal. This wise-cracking rogue is never short of a Bond-style quip as he dispatches his victims, justifying his own actions by claiming he prefers to eat the rude, whereever possible. And despite being on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list, he is somewhat casual about avoiding detection, his only concession being a wide-brimmed hat and the habit of wiping his glass in restaurants so as not to leave any prints.10 years have passed since Lecter escaped, and the young, dour, ultra-professional yet utterly lifeless Special Agent Clarice Starling is now an older, dour, ultra-professional yet utterly lifeless Special Agent. Where once it was possible to understand her severe countenance in the context of youth and eagerness to succeed in a male-dominated environment, it is now clear that Starling really was just a mopey old cow after all. With no friends in the FBI or any apparent social life outside of the office, it really isn't difficult to understand why Clarice's exasperated colleagues make her take the fall for a failed drug bust, relegating her to the decade-old Lecter case in a bid to keep her in the basement and off the streets.Meanwhile, an Italian detective is on Lecter's case. He has rumbled the true identity of Florentine museum curator Dr Fell, and wants to claim the $3,000,000 reward on the sly in a bid to keep his beautiful young wife in clover. He puts the private citizen offering the reward on Lecter's trail at about the same time the FBI uncover his whereabouts, and er...that's it. After taking up an hour or so of screen time, this sub-plot reaches a dead-end, having literally nothing to do with the remaining aspects of the story.So we catch up with the figure offering the cash........surviving Lecter victim Mason Verger, the grossly disfigured and wheelchair bound successor to a large family fortune, who is planning to feed Lecter to a pen-full of man-eating pigs. Starling steps into the fray, and we head towards a repugnant climax in which one of Starling's FBI enemies gets his come-uppance.By this stage, however, you'll be hard-pushed to care what happens to anyone in the story. The film is a big, gory mess, which Scott's elegant direction and Julianne Moore's feisty Jodie Foster impression can do nothing to rescue. As for Hopkin's depiction of Lecter.....whatever happened to the sinister, terrifying figure of Silence of the Lambs? He has morphed into the same character Hopkins played in a dozen other films...the urbane, refined man of a certain age, albeit one who has an unusual recipe for pan-fried liver.Never mind where Lecter is pitching up next.....if they go ahead with plans to make another sequel, I'm leaving the country.",Hannibal
409,extra_terrestrial,THRILLER KILLER,9,10 October 2001,"I don't like when people start comparing the original and sequels. Every film has it's own charm no matter if is original or second part of an original story. Of course, if the second part is a bad movie then it is normal, but comparassments between two films and those immature thinking is simply out of the question cause that is an underestimation of director's work. As much as I liked the first part, I liked second one even better. I only like it better cause of technical things like photography, special effects and sound. Anthony Hopkins did STUNNING work again. He is just too clever as an actor. I wasn't that satisfied with Julianne Moore in the beginning but after half an hour she got relaxed and completely turned into cannibal hunter...Giancarlo Gannini was very good too.

410,spiderfish13,Pros and Cons,6,26 August 2001,"I thought they did a pretty good job with this, all in all.  Don't compare this to Silence of the Lambs though - this is a totally different movie.  As for gory, I don't know.  I read the book first (read it 2 times actually - liked it MUCH better on the second reading.  It was a little hard to take the first time.)  Compared to the gore in the book this movie was like ""Mary Poppins:.  Also - don't expect it to be too much like the book if you have read it.  I think I would have enjoyed it a bit more if I had read the book after seeing the movie.  I am a little bit bummed that Jodie Foster didn't want to play Clarice, but I do think that Moore did a good job with the role.  Anthony Hopkins, as always, was wonderful (perfect for Hannibal Lecter.)  I really hope they do a movie of Red Dragon with him as Lecter. That was my fave book out of the three.All-in-all, I do think Ridley Scott did a really good job.  However, there were a few things that were in the book that were not in the movie that I really wished would be in there (but think that American audiences probably couldn't have handled.)  There were quite a few things I'm glad they left out though.  If you can get this on DVD, I highly recommend getting the special edition one so you can see the making of info.  It is pretty interesting and fun to see how they did all of the special FX.Bon Appetit!  (heh heh.)",Hannibal
411,antoinecatry,Hannibal Lecter : gentleman psychopath ?,3,30 September 2009,"Manhunter and ""Lambs"" did make an effort not only to concentrate on the fascination for evil and morbidity and really tried to construct an investigation, a plot, something of a certain solidity. Its successor (and last episode of the Hannibal series in chronological order) is nothing but a work of blood. Moreover, even if fascination does work on me, I cannot grant an ounce of realism to the Hannibal character. Forgive this incongruous comparison : Batman is able to do justice because he's neurotic, traumatized by the murder of his parents ans wealthy enough to develop his arsenal on his war on crime ; I could believe in Batman in reality. In Lecter, I cannot. In the pictures, he shows a high sense of refinery in the arts, music and paintings ; he despises those he considers vulgar and low. Yet, the persona of Clarice Starling did manage to reveal his sociable side ; ambiguous love story ? I don't think that even Thomas Harris knows himself. Harris just made an important effort in creating a paradoxical man/monster. What puzzles us is that he's cultivated and capable of the most atrocious crimes of flesh at the same time ; in brief, he's not like the real life serial killers. Is he really a serial killer by the way ? What motivates his murders ? His personal freedom when he butchers those who hold him prisoner, but the others ? On what bases does he kill ? Despise for rudeness ? Bordedom generated by the petty tales his patients tell him ? Simply a hobby ? Even the story of his childhood remains superficial in answer to these mysteries. Hannibal Lecter is just a romanesque serial killer, exactly as James Bond is an idealized secret agent capable of speaking several languages and of many other things. This absence of credibility really makes it impossible for me to enjoy this film. Norman Bates or Leatheface are far from exaggerated, next to him.",Hannibal
412,hanniballe11752,"I don't give a Godda*m about this movie, and you shouldn't either.",10,22 October 2001,"It's garbage, just pure utter garbage. Not 'cuz of the gore, mind you, but for several reasons, which because this isn't a damn school paper, I will state them in list form:1. Utterly disjointed. This friggin movie is all over the place, with no handy dandy subtitles telling you where it is now, except in one measly incident when they cut to Sardinia.2. Clarice is horribly underused. Come on, this isn't Jodie Foster's Clarice, or even the one from the book Hannibal. That Clarice was full of depth and imbued with interesting little nuances here and there. This Clarice is white paint on a backyard fence. No fault of Juliane's though. She was given nothing to work with.3. Hannibal Lecter's character has been transformed into a Freddy Kruger with class. Before he was real. He was a genius. He was dangerous. And he was endlessly fascinating. Here he's diminished; bogged down by too many lame ass ""wise""cracks that simply don't fit the character. Anthony, I know how much you hate the profession that has made you so rich, but really this is too much!4.They changed the ending. Now the characters created by Harris do not follow their correct paths as laid down by their Creator. So what you get is not the true Hannibal, and Clarice, but rather Bodysnatcher types that only look, and sound like them, but they're not. *spoiler for book*As many of you already know, in the book, Clarice was finally freed of her father fixation, and dined on the brains of her nemisis. Her character arc was complete. Here, there is no character in the first place. Stephen Zailian botched the job. They should have hired some one with more respect toward the source material. That would have been proper.
There are probably more reasons you should avoid this dreadful, needless sequel made quickly, if not cheaply, to cash in on Hannibal's name brand value, and nothing else. WIthout quality, or craft, or passion. It's a nothing little scrap of celluloid that will forever toil in the shadow of it's superior predessecor for it's utter lack of thematic ambition, or courage.Any one can show guts, but it TAKES guts to take  beloved, well known characters like Hannibal, and Clarice, and show another side of them with which audiences are unfamiliar with, and may not be comfterable with. This movie is spineless.",Hannibal
413,DeepJedi,Society must ask of itself what such as this will lead to. Contains Spoilers.,1,18 February 2001,"Having heard about how disturbing this film was said to be, I was loath to pay to see it myself, since the best way to make a stand against gratuitous and/or gory films is to boycott them.  I had, however, travelled to stay the weekend with a friend, and he really wanted to go.  We both came out of the cinema wishing we hadn't bothered. The film is very flawed, with little of director Scott's talent on show except his willingness to take chances with shocking material.  Having read the book, I can say that Hannibal is a very mundane and unimaginative adaptation.  Neither Hannibal's nor Starling's characters are developed to any depth,leaving me wondering what the film was really all about.  What has Clarice been up to during the last ten years?  She appears to still be single - why?  Surely this is intriguing?  Why this huge self-sacrifice to her career?  We are told that not a day passes when Lector doesn't cross her mind; so how has this affected her?  In what ways has Lector's freedom manifested itself in her psyche?  And what of Lector himself?  We are given no insight into his personality or actions, either those of his past or those seen in the film.  Clearly he is a man of brilliant intellect and extraordinary sensibility, yet we are given nothing of what he wants out of life, what he cares for, beyond superficial details like his love of fine foods and art.  If this is meant to engender a sense of mystique to him, it is misguided since without any understanding of a character's motivations, an audience cannot hope to empathise with them. I was left feeling no involvement, watching a chain of events occur, and nothing more.  What part had Clarice played in Lector's life over the ten years past?  Had he grown to love her?   Had he been following her career, following *her*?  The details are scant indeed, coming along sporadically and even then only in the form of mere hints.  The mystery of Hannibal had already been set up in The Silence of the Lambs - a sequel *demands* a payoff.  There were such details in the book, such as what had made Lector the monster he is, Clarice Starling's life and 'loves' etc. but the screenplay simply omitted these.I noticed a couple of technical flaws i.e. an unjustifiable jump cut and a shot that went out, and then back into, focus, which are, frankly, unforgivable in major studio productions; given that this is a film that will inevitably get nominated for Academy Awards, such faults mustn't be glossed over. Finally, and most importantly, I must comment on the justifiably controversial aspect of this film, its graphic horror.  I knew what was in store, yet I was still deeply disturbed at actually seeing the brain-eating scene.  I felt I *ought* to walk out on it, not because I couldn't stomach it (though some may not be so hardened) but because *it seemed wrong* to be sat watching such images.  The power of film is unquestionable - think advertising, think wartime properganda - so it would be insane to ignore the possible effects of everyday people sitting down to such images as graphic as those in Hannibal, in the name of entertainment.  *This scene was unjustified in the book*, but *no one's* imagination is good enough to deliver the impact that actually witnessing something, with one's own eyes, can.  I contend that *in a book*, such horrors, while having some power, are generally harmless, but to enable such things to be *seen* can actually endanger society.  I am not saying that seeing horror films can make a person kill (though even that can be persuasively argued) but I *am* saying that society will grow increasingly desensitized, which will make us increasing less able to empathise with the suffering of others *in the real world*.  Moreover, children *will* get to see Hannibal on video - don't be under any illusions about this.  With the murder of poor Jamie Bulger, *by children*, so much in our minds again recently, isn't it time society made a stand of some kind against such films getting made, if they are certain to get seen by children once they are released onto video?  Another point is that of where horror films are heading?  Alien was shocking in '79, Starship Troopers in '97(?) - rated 15 in the U.K.- with its casual decapitations and limb-rending, already old hat, and now the slicing, frying and eating of a living man's brain? To conclude, I would say that Hannibal is a very poor adaptation of an enjoyable, quite clever, horror story; there are several plot holes (how did Starling free herself from the fridge, how did she fix the telephone, et al) and some technical flaws.  Characterisations are wafer thin, the style and art direction, score, and even the acting are no more than competant; the final horror scene is gross, utterly gratuitous and morally reprehensible. I would seriously urge everyone to do themselves a favour and go see something else.  If you do, you may also be doing the *decent* thing.",Hannibal

Anthony Hopkins, as usual, shines out, giving even more depth to an already spectacular character. Julianne Moore blows Jodie Foster away, depicting her character far, far better, less forced. Gory? Yes it is, but that's what Hannibal Lecter is all about. I just can't say enough about this movie, really.",Hannibal
415,chainsmoker,Well worth the wait. A thriller to out-thrill all thrillers,10,13 February 2001,"When it comes to movies, I thought I've seen it all. It takes a lot to impress me, let alone shock me. But on February 10th I was literally blown away. I can't give you the details, you'll have to see for yourself. The images from this film will stay in your mind forever.Aside from Roger Ebert (whom Dr Lecter, M.D. will never visit because he has no brains, no heart, no guts, and his head and butt are interchangeable), the only people who didn't like this movie are those who kept comparing it with ""Silence of the Lambs"" and Julianne Moore with Jodie Foster, or had no clue what was going on and failed to read between the lines.  To all of you, put a sock in it.  Go read the book.At first I too thought it wasn't gonna be the same without Foster but the truth is, Sir Anthony Hopkins was the center of the first movie, and still is in the sequel. They could have paired him up with any other actress, wouldn't have made much difference for he is the magnet that pulls you in and keeps you mesmerized, motionless, breathless...Julianne Moore does a great job.  She doesn't try to imitate Foster in any way.  She shows us a different side of Clarice, ten years later.  From the moment she appears on screen she IS Clarice Starling, there's no doubt about it.  Ms Foster was superb in SOTL and deserved the Oscar but she never comes to mind when you watch ""Hannibal"".  Not once.I guess it's part of the human nature to be shocked, whether it's outrageous comedy (like Andrew Dice Clay; something that taps into deep, dark corners of the human soul), or the magic silver screen. Images can be a lot more powerful and shocking than words. They say words can't hurt you, you can hear something and take offense or laugh and forget about it. But visual perception becomes imprinted in our memory and we live with it for the rest of out lives.Even after the final credits finished rolling my mind was still deep at the bottom of some dark abyss, held there by some supernatural force and I couldn't shake it off. I wished I could put my head in a bucket of cold water and then scream at the top of my lungs until my voice fails me. Never had a movie make me feel like this. Well, maybe a couple came close but this one totally rocked my world.  But aren't these the moments we all live for?Ridley Scott presents a masterwork of sheer momentum that rockets seamlessly towards its climax; a razor-sharp entertainment, beautifully constructed, brilliantly shot and guaranteed to chill your blood.  Thrillers just don't come any better than this.  A real roller coaster, full of hairpin turns, sickening descents and sudden accelerations.  I'll go for a ride like this any day.I'm still not quite myself so you have to forgive me, I have to go outside and get a breath of fresh air, do inventory of the remainders of my sanity, if any, and check whether the top of my skull is still in place...

His presence alone makes this movie *** stars already and this time he is very funny and scary at the same time!  The scenes in Italy are breathtaking and a feast for the eyes as is the performance of Hopkins.  The film is very gory intentionally but is directed magnificently by Ridley Scott.  His camera angles and the lighting he used in the gory scenes are a step above any other director out there but maybe Steven Spielberg being the only one who can top him.

Thomas Harris generated palpable tension with his carefully chosen words, and it's so poorly translated to the screen, it made me want to cry. So much detail was left out in the interest of including as many action scenes as possible. Ridley Scott did this story a grave injustice. The very thing that made Silence of the Lambs a huge hit was the tension. This book had even more tension that Silence of the Lambs, which made me look forward to its release with great anticipation. I was SO disappointed. It was a butchered version of the book story without any redeeming qualities. The acting was... I don't want to say poor, but it was insufficient to overcome the terribly butchered script and ridiculous directing. Character development... on pre-existing characters, mind you, as this is a sequel film... was horribly inconsistent with the prior film.Just read the book. Do NOT waste your time with the movie.

418,franklynbob,being a lover of lecter,7,3 February 2002,"I must start off by saying that I love Hannibal Lecter.  He's such a juicy villain and will probably be the most remembered in history.  The Silence Of The Lambs was a fantastic thriller.But, this film doesn't even try to be as good as The Silence Of The Lambs, and I think that people who expected it to aren't too bright.  First we've got Ridley Scott, who is known far more for his action capabilities than his classic film making (except Black Hawk Down, which is very good).The purpose of this film was to satisfy Lecter fans and to bring in a good buck at the box office.  It succeeds greatly on both.This is nowhere near the greatness of Lambs, but if you like Lecter, you will love this.  It's a B movie at best and it knows it is.",Hannibal

Oh, and it was the sequel to Silence of the Lambs... The beginning was nice (besides the awful opening credits and music)and I expected the slow pace would be a good build-up for the horrors to come. The problem is, the film takes too much time before anything happens, and when finally the pace picks up, everything goes way too fast! The beginning sets the mood quite nicely though, but the ""action"" and violence goes by way too hastily (except the last vomit-inducing scene..) and thus all the build-up is shattered, and the viewer is left very disappointed at the whole movie. If there is a slow build-up, there should be reward for the viewers´ patience, but there is very little satisfaction to be gained. Hopkins is good, but the script is nowhere near as good as in SotL, so he comes off less scary and powerful. Julianne Moore is good, but she´s no Jodie Foster. The editing was awful near the end of the movie and the scenes are quite patchy. And the music sucks big time... Overall, a disappointment. 6/10",Hannibal
420,Karmapolice,Another underrated Ridley Scott masterpiece (spoilers),9,17 February 2001,"I didn't think the film was as good a Ridley Scott film as Gladiator, due to the rather unclear definition of its two principal villains, nor did I think it was as good a serial killer film as Seven, as it lacked that film's remarkably intelligent script. Yet the film is, surprisingly for such a successful, mainstream film, a triumph, and confirms Scott as perhaps today's most exciting director.  There are two main themes in the film; that of betrayal, and that of unrequited love. Both Lecter and Starling are constantly betrayed by those around them; he by the detective Pazzi, she by her misogynistic superiors. And, it could be argued, Starling finally betrays Lecter, when she tries once more to trap him at the end of the film. It's pretty obvious why Jodie Foster didn't want to do the film; Starling has not evolved much beyond Silence...; the lambs may have gone, but the dedication to rules and the lack of imagination are still there. In contrast, Lecter is the aesthete gone wrong; this is a man with too much imagination, a man who is weary of pretending to be something he is not. His cannibalism can be seen as a rebellion against the constraints of an incomprehending society rather than an act of brutality, as it was portrayed in Silence.... Unrequited love is the other major theme. Certainly, Hannibal Lecter is in love with Clarice. It is entirely possible that he sees something of a kindred spirit in her, somebody who is willing to step over boundaries and constraints. While I feel that Thomas Harris' original ending was inappropriate, insofar as it meant an unrealistic change on the part of Starling, the film's ending has a classic moment where (and don't read this if you haven't seen the film) Lecter attempts to kiss her, only to be handcuffed. The police are about to arrive. While the old Lecter would have had no qualms about removing Starling's hand, and possibly eating it later, he cuts off his own hand, so as not to disfigure his idol in any way. This is a wonderful touch; this man, who has killed so many people, finally realising that there is beauty outside the world of art history and Italian architecture.  Many people have complained that the film is too violent. My response would be this; Poussin's paintings are 'violent'. Ovid's Metamorphoses are 'violent'. The Bible is 'violent'. And yet did they provoke the level of outcry that Hannibal has? Of course not. Artistically, the film is a triumph, with glorious cinematography and intelligent use of slow and fast motion. Hopkins is unsurprisingly superb, but Moore is very nearly as good in a far less demonstrative role. You've probably seen the film already, but go and see it again.",Hannibal

Some would argue that this is not a sequel but the truth is that the public has the Silence of the lambs in their minds while in the theater so the reference is unavoidable. For my taste, the movie has a lot of good things, including the gorgeous photography, the music and the tone of the movie. How do you make a very disgusting subject appealing? How do you blend the gruesome with the tasteful? I think that Mr Scott made a wonderful job with this movie even though there will be a legion of detractors complaning because they went to see another movie.

The updated Starling remains true to her job as an FBI agent, and she fears the Dr. as always if not more. Great cinematography. You have to see this one on the big screen to feel chills.The action sequences are stunning!!",Hannibal
423,jareinhardt,Definitely disappointing!,2,26 February 2001,It missed the mystic & Mystery of the first.  Julianne Moore just didn't have it.  The role of Clarise was definitely more suited for Jody Foster. This movie was too bloody & unrewarding.  Would not recommend it.,Hannibal
424,SuperBaes,disappointing,6,6 June 2001,"I am a huge Thomas Harris fan.  I was leary when i first heard that Jodie Foster was going to play Clarice Starling, but she was masterful at it. Then, when I heard that Julianne Moore was going to take the mantle, I was disappointed, but nevertheless enthusiastic.It would be an understatement to say that I was not satisfied with the movie.  Going into the theater, I was curious as to how Ridley Scott was going to portray the deep characterization of the novel since the majority of the plot explanation took place inside the ironic order of Lector's perfectly chaotic mind.  As it turns out, the matter was handled though being ignored completely.Comparing this film to it's predecessor, The Silence of the Lambs, is not fair.  The Jodie Foster incarnation was a great screen adaption of an incredible novel, while Hannibal was more of weak attempt at making a two hour long story out of a character sketch.After contemplating my dissatisfaction, I realized that I was being unfair. It is not common for a film to accurately portray a complex novel plot.  I began to think of Hannibal as a movie without using my base knowledge of the book and was not as upset with the performance.  Anthony Hopkins, though absurd at times, is his usual stellar self and Julianne Moore and Ray Liotta were unexpectedly good.One last note:  if anyone who has yet to read the novel wonders what exactly Inspector Pazzi and his wife were like, they will be pleased to hear that Giancarlo Giannini and Francesca Neri were flawlessly cast.",Hannibal
425,Jollycox,Hannibal = Horrible,7,19 October 2002,"This movie was a 6 on my scale. The only thing keeping it that high was Anthony Hopkins. The plot was dull and it almost made me fall asleep at times. I think this movie relied on Gore first, Big Stars second, and plot last. But If you like hannibal lecter youll like this movie.",Hannibal
426,Arthur21743,I finally came to like this one the best of the three in the series...,9,10 May 2005,"I saw this movie some time back and had a few problems with it but didn't think they were worth addressing. I was content to just settle for the parts of the movie that appealed to me and overlook the rest.But now that I have seen The Forgotten (starring Julianne Moore, for which I will write a review as well), I think it it time for me to deal with my problems with the movie, especially my earlier disappointment with Julianne as Jodie Foster's replacement. I had tried after watching Hannibal to do some soul searching as to why I had a negative reaction to Julianne, or, better said, disappointment that Jodie didn't do the sequel. Well, OK. The truth be told, I was right the first time. I found Julianne a disappointment.... Then.I think the reason why those of us who were disappointed that Jodie Foster didn't return felt that way because she projected an air of vulnerability and a certain, well, humanness that Julianne's Clarice seemed to lack. Jodie's Clarice was a woman trying to fit in a man's world the best way she could, while Julianne's Clarice had the air of a hard-boiled feminist type who thought she could get ahead of (or at least hold her own with) her male counterparts with just raw ambition and bad attitude. But if that was the image that Julianne was trying to project, why the scene where she breaks out sobbing? A part I conveniently overlooked in my biased opinion of her as a person, by the way.Well, after seeing Julianne's performance in The Forgotten I am ready to give her the benefit of the doubt and attribute my negative impression of her portrayal of Clarice to bad writing, or worse--to someone in charge of production who may have had an agenda of some sort. I think Julianne did the best she could with what she was given. Actually, I have come to see that I should like Julianne's Clarice better than Jodie's... she lived in the real world of the FBI, and suffered accordingly.Before I get on with the strengths of Julianne's character and her real-life portrayal of what it can be like to work for the Bureau, one little point that struck me as gratuitous: Hannibal cutting off his own hand at the end. Sheesh. What a cheap shot. Well, I imagine that was not thought of as a problem since that was going to be the last of the Lecter appearances in film, chronologically speaking, even though it was shot before the final one, so they didn't have to deal with him being one-handed in the future sequel. (Or was that just a screw up and the final sequel had to therefore take place before the amputation? Maybe I am giving someone too much credit here.) But c'mon, give me a break. Would Hannibal handicap himself living as a fugitive the way he was going to be? I know he respected/had the hots for Clarice, but would he be capable of such selflessness even with her? And where did she hide those handcuffs in that little number she was wearing anyway? Hannibal was much too intelligent, too astute, too observant, to have overlooked a pair of handcuffs concealed on her person. And while he was an M.D. and could sew up bullet wounds, I have a hard time imagining he could have reattached his own hand with only one hand left with which to work. Like I said. Gratuitous. What a shame, since the movie had so much potential to live up to.OK, now that I got that out of my system, I want to get to the heart of the matter: Who made the more realistic FBI agent? Jodie's Clarice or Julianne's? Well, if you believe that honesty, integrity and high moral character ever rule in the agency and that ALL the bad guys are on the outside, then you believe in Jodie's fairyland agency world. But if you believe that there are agents who stand by their oath, who refuse to bend the rules beyond a certain point and love and respect the Constitution and are penalized for it career-wise, then you believe in Julianne's Clarice. You know that it is possible to do your job by the book and still get knifed in the back by your own superior, as did happen in the movie. In fact, Julianne's Clarice did her job so well, and took her oath so seriously, that she even begged Hannibal for the life of her dirty double-crossing boss. Now THAT is commitment to one's sworn duty, isn't it? And that is what inspired me about Julianne's Clarice and the movie itself. They both were honest and showed us what is present reality as well as what can be if we pursue greatness--even in the face of adversity.",Hannibal
427,the_phantom_was_here,Good-bye Clairice,7,13 July 2005,"I was thrilled to finally watching this after watching the amazing original. Anothny Hopkins was incredible in the first one, as was Jodie Foster. As for this this one, you can tell Anthony Hopkins didn't put that much of an effort into playing Hannible Lecter as he did in the first one. In the original, Hopkins tried to resist blinking while talking to make Hannible more creepier. Little things like that just make the character more believable. Julianne Moore didn't play as good of a Clairice Starling as Foster, but she held up for herself. As for the whole movie, it's just a shame that it couldn't have been done by John Demme. One particularly thing I loved most about what him was what he did with the camera in first one. I loved how he did extreme close ups on Lecter, while you as the viewer have feeling to back away. This one just was not as thrilling as the original, it was more weird, really. Although, I do credit the dinner table scene. Overall, this movie is still worth watching if you're a fan of the original. 7/10",Hannibal

The characterizations aren't as razor sharp as in Silence of the Lambs, but the Lector character is still crisp, and the villains are less well drawn, and sometimes a little contrived and silly, but they are still there, working against Lector and Starling both.

When you go and see Hannibal forget them, because you are going to a horror film. The violence is shown raw and in detail (remember not to buy any popcorn). Acting is great Hopkins is again a great Hannibal, but director Ridley Scott didn't make him as attractive as Demme did. Jullianne Moore is a great Clarice, as much as I loved Jodie Foster I didn't miss her. I even think that for this movie Moore is a better choice.

The special effects are excellent, the plot is great, it's scary, funny, well acted, and a very worthy sequel to Silence.  This movie is chocked full of brain eatin', face peelin', pig attackin' FUNTIMES!  Good horror movies are few and far between, and Hannibal is definitely one of them.  If you like horror movies you're gonna love this, if you don't like horror, why the heck would you watch it?

434,Truman_Burbank,Where is the soul?,6,28 February 2001,"I don't understand why this movies gets this much of enthusiastic reactions by the IMBD-members.  I didn't like it that much. First of all, the story was not interesting.  In fact, a good plot was missing.  'Hannibal' lacks surprises, psychological depth and real people and emotions.  Liotta and Goldman's characters were nothing but caricatures, and Hannibal Lecter has lost much of his creepy manners. Ridley Scott made some great movies, but I don't think he got any little bit involved in making this, emotionally I mean.  So I wonder where the 'soul' of this movie is.  Everyone involved in the making of 'Hannibal' probably assumed this was going to be a great movie, so they forgot to make the efforts for it. And then the actors.  Hopkins is never bad, but if you compare his performance to those in 'Titus', 'Remains of the Day' and especially 'Silence of the Lambs', this isn't a great performance.  And although I like Julianne Moore a lot (Boogie Nights! End of the Affair!  Big Lebowski!), this role was so badly written that it would only reach the audience if it was played by Jodie Foster again! Of course there were some good moments too (the pigs, Liotta's head during dinner, the scenes in Italy), but there wasn't a single moment that the movie touched me in any way, and isn't that what cinema is all about?",Hannibal

As for the movie, I liked everything about it but the ending.  The ""shocking twist"" wasn't very shocking and I was somewhat let-down.  I would have preferred the book-ending rather than what they did with the movie.  I didn't really miss Jodie Foster at all.  I like Julianne Moore as the new Starling and I really couldn't see Jodie Foster taking on this movie anyway--she's not missed.  I do wish there was a little more emotion coming from Clarice, she seemed a little too hardened after 10 years.  Anthony Hopkins is different in this film compared to the first. He's a little over-the-top, but it's acceptable and understandable (the book was over-the-top as well).  Here we see Hannibal free and living life, doing everything he's truly passionate about, yet he's bored and he needs to play. There were just a few parts in the plot that make little or no sense, but I will not spoil them here.  I really missed some characters from the book that didn't make the movie, mainly Margot Verger (Mason's sister) and the swimming eel.  There is an eel in the film, but it's shown quite briefly and nothing ever comes from it as it does in the book.  I also don't think they fully explained the true relationship and emotions Hannibal and Clarice have for one another, whether it's fear, dread, hatred, love, father-figure, teacher, etc.  They could have done a little more with the story had they not been so eager to make the film so quickly.

438,stephenmogg,A terrific film which keeps the legend alive...,9,20 February 2001,"When you consider the challenges that were overcome to get this film made, I am surprised that Hannibal hit the screen at all. That fact that it has and turns out to be a master class in the art of filmmaking makes it all the more remarkable. Straight away I thought Julianne Moore was right for Clarice Starling and she proves this with some punchy dialogue effectively delivered ensuring the innate toughness of Starling comes shining through. Surprisingly perhaps, the major change is not in Starling, as you would expect being played by a different actress, but in Anthony Hopkins performance of Lecter. It makes perfect sense though. In 'Lambs', Lecter was imprisoned and behaved accordingly. Surely we couldn't expect Hopkins to simply reprise the performance he gave in 'Lambs'. Instead, in yet another seemingly effortless performance, he underplays marvellously to give us the appearance of benevolence cloaking evil. In Hannibal we see other aspects of Lecter's personality, notably his love of the arts and his great aesthetic sense. He is much more gregarious and provides some of the amusing moments in the film as well as the most horrific. This film provoked a range of emotions in me, it made me laugh, jump out of my seat and in the end, go home full of admiration for a great film. Certainly the ending differs from the novel but enough has been written on that elsewhere and it is not the only element of the book that has been changed in the journey to the big screen. I believe however those changes are largely necessary to make the story filmable as well as serving to keep our attention more tightly focussed on the central characters and story.So often, sequels crash and burn as they rely on the reputation of what has gone before but Ridley Scott has paid tribute to what is obviously fast becoming a movie legend as well as making Hannibal a great, great film.",Hannibal

The saga would really be worth watching when the 3rd and final chapter appears in theaters within the next decade.The script was great, the story flowed smoothly from where it picks up from silence of the lambs, but the end of this one seemed kind of lame.I look forward to a great showdown in the next chapter of this Hannibal Lecter Saga.6/10",Hannibal
440,BenGW1,"Bloody very well-done, controversy over it's kind of overblown",8,16 September 2001,"The comparison between THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and HANNIBAL, beyond the obvious original-vs.-sequel debate, isn't a fair one when focusing on the level of horror and fear attained. HANNIBAL didn't really scare me at all when I watching it, and not much afterwards either. I don't think it even qualifies as a horror film, the high level of graphic violence notwithstanding.Where HANNIBAL works at a high level, as high as any film I've seen this year, is a psychological drama that moves like a thriller and takes time to explore all of the major characters. It's a manipulation that Hannibal Lecter is not as ""bad"" a man as the stories major villains--Mason Verger, Paul Krendler, even Pazzi--but the movie pulls it off. Once again, we don't much mind when Lecter kills and, um, does other stuff with his victims because they're jerks. They certainly treat Clarice Starling like crap, and Julianne Moore does a brilliant job at showing an older Clarice, someone who knows she's great at what she does, knows the powers that be (especially Krendler) hate her for just not going away, and knows that she'll never be accepted. One sly notion floated in the film is that Clarice does fear and hate Lecter, but at least respects him for not lying about what he is. The ending reflects this paradox nicely.Above everything else, the film looks beautiful and moves like lighting. Ridley Scott simply has the right touch to propel a film's narrative through the ennui or lengthy exposition that has torpedoed many a dramatic thriller. In a lesser film, the material with Pazzi and Lecter in Italy would feel like a waste of time, but here it's good enough to make a movie in itself.And HANNIBAL is not as gory or violent as most people think.  There are several scenes where incredible violence or torture are IMPLIED (Pazzi's exit, the massacre at Verger's, the fate of the petty thief who gets Lecter's ID at a huge cost), but the film does not linger on the blood. It sure does so at the climax, granted. It's certainly a very hard R, but an NC-17? I would say no.The best situation in the movie comes when Hannibal uses a single line of dialogue to solve two problems at once at Verger's, before he exits the stage. You'll see what I mean.",Hannibal

Is it because I was so hyped up about going to see it that I couldn't bear to be disappointed? Probably. So anyways...Anthony Hopkins gives another excellent performance as Hannibal ""the Cannibal"" Lecter, Julianne Moore is fine as FBI Agent Clarice Starling (not as good as Jodie though), and Gary Oldman as the deranged Mason Verger? Fantastic! The film's problems? It's too graphic. The ""hanging"", the pigs (or boars or whatever), the ""brain-food"" scene...It would have been OK if we had just seen the aftermath of it, not him doing actually doing it. And they cut out quite alot from the book. Where's Margot? And Barney should have had more screentime. So, it's not nearly as good as ""Silence of the Lambs"", but it's OK in it's own way.

442,dudleynomore,Misses the point...,2,2 October 2002,"IMHO, Hannibal the book (it's original title, if you're interested, was ""The Morbidity Of The Soul"", which I think is much better) was the best book of the series, but this film misses the point completely. Scenes like the brain eating at the end were done in COMPLETELY the wrong way - for shock value - when hello, people, THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE FUNNY. In the book, after the meal Lector scrapes the leftovers from the plates into Paul Krendler's head to ""help clear up"". Similarly, the death of Pazzi was done in a shock-horror rather than an amusing revenge-thriller type way. In the book, Lector pushes Pazzi off the balcony, then stops and waves to watching tourists. Again I say: IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE FUNNY.I'd like to reserve particular condemnation for the producer's decisions over Oldman's Mason Verger (Oldman himself is blameless). Verger was always a character that should have been done with CGI and animatronics, not with some half-assed goopy makeup. He doesn't look like someone whose lost their face, he looks like someone who's had seriously amateurish plastic surgery! Also, the casting of Krendler was so off (both from the dictates of the character and the description of him in the book) that I'd like to eat Ridley Scott's brain myself. I doubt there's enough to fill more than a crepe, however. I can understand editing out Margot in a film already this long, but the way they've solved the plot holes her removal leaves is horribly underwhelming.What Ridley obviously didn't get was that the whole point of Hannibal was to concentrate on Hannibal Lector himself (nuh!), and get inside his mind. This could easily have been done - I was very disappointed there were no scenes within Lector's ""Dream Palace"", given that it was such an easy and obvious visual metaphor. The movie started in the wrong place (with a shoot-out that is of only peripheral relevance to the plot and should have been done in flashback), had it's middle in the wrong place (following Pazzi around was completely pointless as it was obvious even to those who hadn't read the book he wasn't going to capture Lecter), went on too long (with the pointless sequence where Starling follows Lector around the shopping mall, amoungst other things), and ended badly. Aside from obviously redoing the brain eating, the end should have been like the book, with a attempt to resolve Starlings ""issues"" and a sort of slowdown to a dreamlike pace instead of attempting to provide one last scare (as it actually does). None of this happens in the film, so their relationship remains one of predator vs. prey, and is as interesting as that entails. The last bit with the brain packed lunch is truely rubbish as well.",Hannibal
443,dan2058,The silence is broken but was Hannibal more chilling whilst in captivity?,7,3 November 2002,"First things first, you have to give credit to Anthony Hopkins for making the part of Hannibal his own. In 'The silence of the lambs' he managed to scare his audience from behind a plastic screen and strike fear into us all through his beautifully delivered speeches and piercing stare. 'Hannibal' had the chance to build on this as Lecter is now roaming free around Italy. Unfortunately the film doesn't make the most of this and Hannibal Lecter seems for the most part to be more mellow than deceptively calm. Lecter walked freely through the streets but there was no real indication of him being an evil threat to the public, he had no menace about him. There was scope to really build Hannibal into film's most notorious monster but there were only glimpses of how dangerous the character is.The ending to the book that the film is based on is completely different to the film, yet this is understandable as the book's ending is quite unfilmable. This does not excuse the weak ending to the film. Although Lecter cutting his hand off shows his affection for Starling, I got the feeling that she didn't realise this and for me this heavily emotional point of the film was a little flat. In the book Clarice actually responds to Hannibal's feelings and they end up together but to do this the film would have had to have played more heavily on Starling's missing father and Hannibal's dead sister, which is skipped completely in the film. The book sees the characters missing their close relationships and then realising that they don't need the other to fill that place.The direction is fantastically well done and the film beautifully photographed as we've come to expect from Ridley Scott. Gary Oldman is great as the deformed and depraved Mason Verger while Ray Liotta and Giancarlo Giannini do justice to the characters of the book. Whilst Julianne Moore's portrayal of Starling isn't quite as good as Jodie Foster's, she does give a good effort to carrying on a character that was already well known and established. Credit must be given for changing the style of the movie and not trying to cash-in on the already popular predecessor.As a follow-on film to 'The silence of the lambs' this doesn't really work but as a stand-alone film it does quite well. I recommend seeing it if you haven't already done so, as it is quite an enjoyable movie and although Lecter's character seems almost diluted he is still quite capable of delivering a classic line or two (I'm giving great thought to eating your wife).",Hannibal

Well, to me it didn't.In retrospect, i think ""Hannibal"" is an unbelievable movie, especially the way special agent Clarice Starling handles the case and the ending of it. If you haven't seen it yet, don't bother. The blood 'n' gore level isn't high enough to make it a good horror and the whole atmosphere in the movie is more like a bad opera (is that why they choose Venice as a location ?) than a thriller (i couldn't find one scary part).Bummer from A - Z",Hannibal

""Avarice, hanging, self destruction"" - ""I make my own home be my gallows."" It still works. Be aware of Renaldos, Masons, Pauls...Julianne Moore gave an outstanding ""Goodbye"" to the phantom 'Clarice Starling' that almost became real by that magnificent work of her predecessor. She never tried to copy something from her, and she did not ""trample"" on ""her"".

After ""Silence"", Anthony Hopkins had become one of THE actors of the 90's (along with Kevin Spacey); with ""Gladiator"", Ridley Scott had finally risen to the heights of ""Blade Runner"" again; and the prospect of seeing Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling filled my heart with joy.Therefore the result was all the more shocking - and really not because of the grossness of some scenes. As with so many horror movies, the gorier the scenes the less shocking the effect. Blood feasts like ""Dawn of the Dead"" and ""Man Eater"" are still hard to top, and ""Silence"" had certainly proven that you do not need blood and guts to drive the audience crazy.Therefore, what is really disturbing about ""Hannibal"" is the fact, that it is so surprisingly boring. Part of it certainly has to do with the fact that there is almost nothing new to the relationship between Hannibal and Clarice. And although I'm convinced that Julianne Moore is the better actress in comparison to Jodie Foster, she didn't bring anything interesting to her role. She's almost sleepwalking through the movie, sometimes with a gun in her hand, but psychologically there's almost nothing going on. (Compare that to the intensity of her pharmacy-scene in ""Magnolia"", and you know what I was hoping for.) I'm sad to say that Jodie Foster was right in her decision not to come back.Even sadder is the development of Dr. Lecter: He's become the hero, but does it make sense to have the audience root for a psychopath? In that respect, ""Silence"" was really brilliant, because you were terrified of Lecter, but you were also fascinated by him. It was a bizarre thing: You hoped to see him again in order to be terrified of him. You just never knew what to expect from him. In ""Hannibal"", Lecter has been degraded to a conventional horror figure, just short of Freddy Krueger, tossing out oneliners as if he was reborn as the evil brother of James Bond or the hyper-intelligent uncle of Arnold Schwarzenegger, a circus manager in charge of a freak show.Only therefore it's fitting that his counterpart is Mason Verger, the mousy-looking cripple who never becomes a real character. You don't feel his pain or his anguish, just think about the grueling make-up sessions Gary Oldman certainly had to endure. (All the more puzzling is the clearness of his voice - shouldn't we have more trouble understanding him?) Scott & Co. have made the horrible mistake of leaving out Verger's sister - one of the more involving subplots of the novel. This way, the Verger storyline is totally one-dimensional and you can't wait for someone to feed this creature to the pigs.Now any hope that the film might at least be great to look at (like almost every other Ridley-Scott-movie) is destroyed early on, during the first shoot-out, which mutilates the action into bits and pieces, and you don't get a sense of the scenery. Just as every action scene in ""Gladiator"" was masterfully choreographed with a sense for visual poetry, the action in ""Hannibal"" looks murky and uninspired. (And there's definitely too much music throughout the movie.) About the only good things in this film are the scenes in Florence, but maybe that's because Inspector Pazzi (the touching Giancarlo Giannini) is the only real character of the movie, the only person that conveys hints of thoughts and feelings. The rest is a disaster, including the all too obvious casting choice of Ray Liotta as Starling's simply slimy nemesis Paul Krendler. And last but not least: Where the hell was Scott Glenn? His small role in ""Silence"", where he played Starling's superior, was so vital to the balance of the story. And he was even more important in ""Hannibal"", the novel. Well, I guess that's what makeing ""Hannibal"", the movie, so bad: They left out all the good things - and dwelled on the bad stuff.",Hannibal

While I thought that Silence of the Lambs was one of the greatest movies I've ever seen, this movie is just a sick slasher film.  The start of the movie is pointless as we see Clarice shoot some drug dealer. The only reason this scene is in the film is to establish a ""bad guy"" for Lechter abuse at the end of the film. There are no deep psychological things going on here, Lechter get's under Clarice's skin by referring to her parents as mommy and daddy?  The Oldman character was interesting, but in the end just kind of teetered out and was nothing more than an excuse to show off some make-up skills.While a few people in the audience laughed at Lechter's self-referencing humor (see Freddy in later Nightmare on Elmstreet Films), there was hardly in humor in it.  I was never surprised by any plot turns, just by the methods Hannibal used in the end to express his depravity.When I realized what was happening in the final scene of the movie, I should have left.  Is our world so sick that someone could even think up something like that?  Is our world so depraved that we are now paying money to see someone do something like that?  Are we so jaded that - i won't give away what the end scene is - is a joke?  I had to shower when I got home.  I am humiliated that I am a pathetic enough person to have watched the end of that.

In the past couple of years, it seems producers and directors are bent on making films that drive me closer and closer to insanity. Hannibal was not an exception. I wasn't expecting much, when I went in to see the movie. The book was ridiculous, and the saying, ""The Book is always better than the movie"" did not assure me at all that this movie would be anything but trash. But what I came to see was a movie that made all other bad movies seem better in comparison.         Usually, when I see a terrible movie, I find myself more amused than anything else. Sadly though, I could not even laugh at the sad excuse for a film that Hannibal is. The movie was filmed with promise, I guess. It had Anthony Hopkins, Julianne Moore, and Gary Oldman. And for directing, there was Ridley Scott. There have been movies with significantly less talent that have been tremendously better. There was so much I would have cut from this film that I doubt anything would have remained. It was pathetic. The storyline was so ludicrous that it seemed like a complete idiot had written it. What's worse is that the book was even crazier, and there were some scenes that were too extreme to be included, which is sad in the case of a movie where
***SPOILER AHEAD*** Ray Liotta's brain was being cooked in pieces. That scene more than any other made me want to cry, because it tarnished its predecessor to such a monumental level.

Even with the shocking ending, another 20-30 minutes wouldn't have hurt my patience so that film could explore other characters and situations(which sadly didn't make it to the film) that were included in the book.

Ridley Scott is one of my heros and he never fails to impress.  Hans Zimmer's powerful and haunting score proves that he is truly a master of his subject. Anthony Hopkins is amazing again as the ""good doctor"". Julianne Moore is perfect as the much older and wiser(not to mention sexier)  Clarice Starling.  I can't help but think how incredibly dumb people are for hating this film or not wanting to view because it is not Silence of the Lambs or the absent Jodie Foster.  Please.  Clarice Starling character is not to complex that it can't be done by two or three other actresses out there.  There is nothing truly special about Foster's performance in SOTL.  Gary Oldman is great as Mason Verger however the character played a much bigger role in the novel than what is presented here.  In fact, the only serious gripe about this film is that it couldn't live up to the novel.  Don't get me wrong, this is a great adaptation of a fantastic piece of modern literature.  But they shouldn't have changed the ending or omit a lot of scenes and four characters out of the novel.

From start to the point at which I walked out 2 hours in, the script was as predictable as if I had written it myself, and as is all too common, the makers of this debacle vainly tried to drown the shortcomings of the script in gallon after gallon of fake blood.  This was NOT ""Silence of the Lambs 2"".  This was ""I Know What You Did Last Summer 3"" with half the silicone, eight times the salary and a little opera music thrown in to make it seem ""cultured"".  It is no surprise whatsoever to me that Jodie Foster was unavailable.  If I had been part of ""Silence"" and then seen what was coming with ""Hannibal"", I would have made myself ""unavailable"", too.

459,elektra33,A new lease of life on DVD,10,19 August 2001,"When I first saw ""Hannibal"" at the cinema in February 2001, I was highly disappointed, I felt the first hour had some depth and good character work, but the plot(s) - especially the Verger storyline were unengaging and slightly predictable.On DVD (and with the added commentaries as a guide), I found the film really took on a second lease of life. Moore was better than I remembered as Clarice Starling, Hopins as deliciously evil as before and Oldman, better, but still not perfect in his role.Maybe I enjoyed the film more, because I had just finished watching ""Silence"" on DVD - still as thoroughly engaging as I remembered.
The only comparison between the two is the strong acting throughout both films. Both films have annoying characters - Dr Chilton in ""Silence"" and Paul in ""Hannibal"" - but both have distinct feels to the films, which make you equally identify them as separate films. Hopefully, in time, Ridley WILL make the Director's cut of this film which he claims he won't make, as many of the Deleted Scenes were very good and would have added to the film a lot. Obviously, the thing I most wondered on a repeated viewing is how I would feel about the ending, at the cinema, I absolutely hated it. On DVD, it was......better. Still outrageously stupid, but better than it was on first watch. I would say ""Hannibal"" is a little bit behind ""Silence"" on every level, but only slightly. The one thing that ""Hannibal"" did have over ""Silence"" was a shocking and powerful soundtrack that is already a classic.So, I say, give it another go if you didn't like it.

A main character, Mason Verger's sister, is missing in the film. The ending which I didn't like in the book is dramatically changed for the film.  I actually liked this ending better although it almost changed the entire premise of the authors ideas.  Hopkins is fantastic as Hannibal, and Moore did a credible job as Clarice Starling although she may have tried a little too hard to appear like Jody Foster.

462,akpiggott,"Breaking the Silence, not Imitating It!",8,23 August 2001,"The Silence of the Lambs was a masterpiece. I was delighted to hear that the sequel was going to be put into the capable hands of Ridley Scott, one of the greatest directors of the late 20th century. It was also a joy to hear that Hopkins would reprise his role as Hannibal, but it was a great disappointment learning that Jodie Foster won't return.Comparing Hannibal to Silence of the Lambs is a mistake that many people make. As Scott himself puts it, Hannibal is more of a sequel to the characters of SotL, not a sequel to the film itself. Hannibal introduces new things that Silence left untouched. To many people, this change makes Hannibal unfaithful to the original. In my opinion, the best sequels are the ones that tread new ground. It is probably due to the rarity of these sequels that a series original is always quoted as being the best.Anyway, Julianne Moore does a great job of bringing Starling back. I'm glad that they could find a suitable actress to replace Foster. Hopkins as expected, is a joy to watch from start to finish, he dominates every scene he's in with the same fashion that made him so great in SotL. The rest of the cast were very strong too. I was a little disappointed that Gary Oldman's unique talent of portraying bad guys was wasted on an unrecognisable guy in a rubber mask, but that was a minor setback.Yes, the film is quite gory. Gore doesn't offend me much, but one scene near the end was quite hard to stomach (more on that later). The film was quite a tense affair, despite the large manhunt, Hannibal keeps his cool and allows us to do all the sweating. Ridley certainly brought a few directional techniques from his previous movie, Gladiator. There were lots of slow downs and camera effects that Gladiator fans should feel at home with. And as usual, Hans Zimmer provides a great soundtrack.
***The following paragraph contains SPOILERS!!***
The one part of the movie that left an ugly taste in my mouth was the dinner scene near the end. It seemed unrealistic for Paul to remain alive, let alone conscious, with the top of his head sliced off and his brain exposed. Since my first viewing it has come to my attention that this is possible. Exposing the brain obviously doesn't kill people, otherwise we wouldn't have brain surgery. Paul manages to stay conscious because of the heavy dose of morphine that Hannibal pumped into him, if it weren't for this, Paul would have most likely died of shock, or would have at least fainted. However, this evidence still doesn't help much. The scene still feels way too unsubtle and exposed to deserve a part in this film.Apart from the inconvinience mentioned in the above paragraph. Hannibal is still a solid modern thriller, try not to compare to SotL, and you're in for a treat. It is probably one of Ridley Scott's worst efforts, but it still has plenty of entertainment value. Rating: 8/10.",Hannibal
463,a_k_42,a good 6 but no 7,6,24 August 2001,"this movie is a good 6 but no 7. first of all it is a typical ridley scott movie. fast cuts with slight blure effects. the music very good, but a bit to dramatic.you could write the story on the head of a nail. in part one (silence of the lambs) you had to imagine the really bad things hannibal lecter did to his victims. but i think that they didn´t get the writer of part one to wirte a good sequel so they use visuell shocking scene to get the same effect. this didn´t work out perfect. some of the things shown (like the endscene) are a bit to heavy to show and are not realy realistic i hope.anyway, it is, as far as i can remember, the badest movie made with antony hopkins. this moviestar could easily play some really difficult characters, but now this. thats worse !i in person, love film characters who are bad and aware of the things the people they are chased from do, but this is a bit to much. he always knows everthing in advance. you believe antony playing this role, but sometimes it is way too much.all in all this movie is not worth to be seen in cinema or to be bought on dvd or vhs, but renting this movie will be ok.you really shouldn´t watch this movie with your girlfriend after all ;-)",Hannibal
464,thomas2193,Disappointing sequel,5,8 September 2014,"Because I've always been a huge admirer of the 1990 motion picture 'The Silence of the Lambs', I gave this sequel from 2001 a try. Well, to be honest, I still regret that decision, because Hannibal hurts the original film 'Silence of the Lambs', which is a perfectly executed thriller.It's not because of the lack of any decent storytelling, since the story is already there. We knew that Dr. Hannibal Lecter escaped from his mental institution in a brutal way, and he was wandering around the earth freely, since he gave Agent Starling a call at the end of the Silence of the Lambs. So it's only natural, that there would be a sequel to that unfinished tale. It's a shame that they didn't put on a better effort, because it could've easily been another masterpiece, as well as a sequel of good quality that actually makes sense, storyline wise, because that's exactly what most of the sequels lack. The chemistry between Dr. Lecter and Agent Starling completely lacks in this sequel, and that's the one thing that made the first film exceptionally strong. Jodie Foster declined to take on the role of Starling for the second time. If she hadn't declined, I think the film would've been a lot better, but still not nearly as good as the prequel Silence of the Lambs. Julianne Moore now takes on that role of agent Starling, and although she tries, she just doesn't fit that role. It's that simple. There's no psychological chemistry between her and Anthony Hopkins in this sequel, so there's no decent screenplay.Now if the plot would've gone a bit more in the direction of Silence of the Lambs, with clever twists and psychology, it actually might have been a bit better, but even that couldn't be accomplished here. There are some strong scenes during the film, mainly due to the terrific performance from Hopkins, who portrays Hannibal Lecter perfectly as he always does. He's still the extraordinary clever psychopath; the only problem is that there's no real opponent for him like Foster was as agent Starling in the prequel. That's a pity. When the film finally seems to get a little better during the slot scenes, they completely drop the ball by actually portraying Hannibal as a complete monster that enjoys destroying other human beings in a very brutal way that can make you sick to your stomach. That's what destroys the Hannibal character in my opinion. He should always have been that sick and twisted, but still, in some ways, admirable psychologist who mentally manipulates people. Right here, they have him cut open somebody's skull and feed the guy's own brains to him. That just doesn't feel right compared to the psychological wars that he fights with fellow prisoners during Silence of the Lambs. That's why this film is a complete disappointment to me. While it actually isn't a horrible film in any way, it's just that it kills the psychological dramatic story that made Silence of the Lambs the success that it remains up until this day. If you're a fan of the psychological twists of the Silence of the Lambs, I'd recommend you to avoid this unsatisfying sequel. If you enjoy watching disgusting horror movies, rather than thrillers that are filled with suspense, this may very well be the movie for you. I've got to give credit to Anthony Hopkins however, since he's the only good thing about this film. His performance is just incredible.",Hannibal

If you are a Nightmare on Elm Street fan, and love Freddy Kruegers jovial banter when preparing to kill his victims, you will love this flick. Hannibal Lecter has been reduced from a highly intelligent, sophisticated psychopathic killer to a wisecracking killer with unusual dietary habits. The producers of this film along with the director should be ashamed of themselves for wasting the incredible talents of the top two billed actors in this picture. Hannibal was too funny, Clarisse had a chip on her shoulder throughout most of the movie. The chemistry that Jodie Foster and Sir Hopkins shared in SOTL was missing because of poorly scripted dialog in which the two characters didn't really talk to each other, but rather spoke at each other with their own agenda. This movie wants so desperately to be a Saturday night date flick that it forgets that most of the accolades the first movie received were because the acting was so superb that you left the movie with the creeps instead of having nausea. SOTL was for the most part not graphic in the violence it displayed, however Hannibal takes the idea about visceral gross out to a new extreme. If you like gore, you'll love this movie. If you are looking for an Oscar contender, go check out Chocolat, or Cast Away because the golden Statue doesn't give awards for assuming that the prime target audience of this picture is stupid. The movie cheated from the book in some key ways which I will not share in this forum.

The locations and the framing of almost every shot with little exception is fantastic just to sit back and take in.  Furthermore, this film's screenplay was done by David Mamet, who gave us Glengarry Glen Ross.  With the combination of all that mixed together, Hannibal blows its predecessors (Silence and Manhunter) out of the water without a doubt.

Whether it compares favourably with Silence of the Lambs is a difficult question as the two films are very different, Silence being a lot more psychological than physical.

I think this worked in my favor. I wasn't trying to compare the two films together and was, perhaps, able to enjoy this film more than some others.
Mild Spoilers AheadThe opening was a very typical Hollywood product, where a gun fight was used to ""hook"" the audience's interest and to provide the momentum for the next act. The pace slowed during the second act, when the script was trying to establish the major characters. This was where we get to know their motivations and their personalities. This part receives the most criticism on my part because I felt the characters could be developed more. This act is slow but there is that beautiful score by Patrick Cassidy ""Vide Cor Meum"" that grabs your attention every time it comes on.  Nevertheless, the ending was very good, which propelled beyond the usual nice-and-tidy Hollywood ending. The writers definitely were planning on another sequel.End SpoilersI do vaguely remember the Silence of the Lambs. And I have to admit that this film doesn't compare to what I remember about the original. But, this film stands well on its own. There were moments when the dark humor used in the movie that could send you giggling and shivering at the same time. If it is not titled ""Hannibal: the sequel to Silence of the Lambs"", then perhaps people wouldn't be as critical on this film if it was ""just another horror film"".

Silence of the Lambs was an incredible film - a gruesome thriller with a superb story and high jump-factor....What I don't understand is why THIS movie was made... and why Anthony Hopkins agreed to reprise his role as Hannibal the Cannibal in this terrible and dissatisfying film.There's no possible way to spoil the movie any further than going to see it could, but for those of you who prefer to waste your money, DON't READ ON. The film is absolutely horrible. It's so bad that the transition from Jodie Foster to Julianne Moore becomes a non-issue. The only way to truly enjoy the film is to set your watch and leave the theatre exactly two hours into the film, because up until that point, it's quite an interesting thriller. The reparte between Moore and Hopkins is comparable to Hopkins and Foster, and the performances by the other characters are pretty good. But literally at the two hour mark, the film degrades into nothing but a cheesy D-grade horror flick...it's sick, and it's stupid and almost like the crew ran out of filming time, and threw together an ending in one day of filming.Initial buzz over the Thomas Harris' book's unsatisfying and bizarre ending led director Ridley Scott to order a re-write... and, honestly, having seen the film AND read the book's finale, I don't know which is worse.Please - don't waste your money OR time on this film, unless you're prepared to leave EXACTLY at the two hour point, because that's the ONLY way you'll feel satisfied about the  saga of Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter... continuing the mystery that made the first film, and the wait for this one, so great.",Hannibal
472,BoJangles-3,Goody Goody,9,12 February 2001,"Let me preface my comments by saying that I hate it when they replace actors with new ones in sequels.  Having said that, I was nervous when I heard that they were making this film without Jodie Foster.  Her performance last time was so memorable and perfect that I truly didn't think that this film could succeed without her.  Then, I heard that they cast Julianne Moore in her place and was not nearly as nervous.  Moore is a gifted actress who could pull something like this off, I thought, and I was right.  Moore is excellent in this film, bringing to life a 10 years older Clarice Starling, somewhat more vulnerable, but more experienced.  Hopkins is awesome as usual, but really, we have come to expect that from him.  The film is beautifully directed and edited by Ridley Scott, and the grand sweeping shots of Florence help to create a visually stunning film.  Hans Zimmer's musical score is also excellent combining the fear of the serial killer that is Hannibal Lecter, with the sophisticated beauty of his tastes.  Gary Oldman turns in an adequate performance, although the Mason in the book is more scary than cartoonish, and in this film, he is pretty much a villian from a Scooby Doo show.  We could use less of him and more Starling-Lecter time.  The build up is excellent and the film may not be as excellent as Silence of the Lambs, but it is more fun.  Clearly, Scott, and Hopkins are having fun.  Quotes like ""goody goody"" ""okey dokey"" and his answering of a cell phone to talk to Clarice for the first time are classic Lecter.  This film is also not nearly as scary as the first film, mainly due to the fact that you are not afraid of what Hannibal will do to Clarice.  You know he doesn't want to kill her, so there really is no suspense there.  They even managed to change the ending of the film to reflect the general tone of the book, without the unbelievable result between Starling and Lecter, and yes, it certainly leaves open for another sequel.  It is definitely an above average sequel and is truly worth an invitation to dinner.",Hannibal

After screwing up on the job Clarice played in the sequel by Julianne Moore is forced to take a case dealing with Hannibal Lecter. This case is brought up by Hannibal's fourth victim the very wealth and disfigured Mason Verger played disturbingly by Gary Oldman who has put out a 3 million dollar reward for anything leading to the capture of Hannibal Lecter.Hannibal who escaped to Buenos Aires in Silence now lives in Florence(not surprising he did mention Florence in Silence) and is recognized by a detective who plans to capture Lecter for the reward.However not knowing what hes dealing with is killed in the process and tells Hannibal about Mason Verger.While questioning the detective his cellphone rings and after ten years Clarice and Hannibal make contact. Now after conversing Hannibal decides to go back to the U.S and play cat and mouse with Clarice after she is temporarily discharged after District Attorney Paul Krendler plants evidence that Clarice has made contact with Lecter and is later found.Finding out what Krendler has done Lecter follows him to his beach house and drugs him. When Lecter asks Clarice to meet at Union Station Masons henchmen follow and capture Lecter in front of Clarice. Hannibal being captured and Mason ready to make him suffer backfires when Clarice goes to free Lecter and succeeds but gets shot in the process. Leaving Hannibal to save her and takes her to Paul Krendlers beach house where Lecter has planned dinner.Yum!Clarice who wakes up dizzy elegantly dressed calls the police and heads down to dinner with a heavily sedated Krendler and Lecter preparing dinner.Later we find out whats the main course is Krendlers brain. After dinner Lecter cleans up in the kitchen and Clarice decides to knock out Lecter with a candle stick Lecter overpowers her and gets her caught in the refrigerator door. As he kisses her she cunningly hand cuffs him with her and Lecter simply grabs a meat cleaver and asks ""above or below the wrist"".We see Hannibal strike down the cleaver but we later find out he cut off his own hand. In the end Hannibal escapes and is on a plane. Review:This was a great movie. Anthony Hopkins was scarier than in Silence because now he is out in the open and not in cell. Though Jodie Foster didn't return for the sequel Julianne Moore did just fine with her accent and tough attitude considering she isn't a trainee anymore.Some great performances by its supporting cast such as Gary Oldman as Mason who seems very disturbing and psychotic. And Ray Liotta playing Krendler a real a**hole.I heard that Jonathan Demme would direct this but Ridley Scott is obviously the better choice he kept SOTL's original style but gave it more life with his camera work in Italy and making Clarices workspace look more creepier than ever and Hannibal's new look with the clothes and not the jumpsuit.Written by two great writers David Mamet(Glenngarry Glenn Ross,Spartan,Wag the Dog) and Steven Zallian(Schindler's List) this film succeeds in every way possible with no faults. Id recommend it to fans of Silence and people interested in seeing a great film.",Hannibal

Well I did, otherwise, I wouldn't be able to judge it, of course, however I went at it with obviously the wrong perspective. I have grown to like films involving the scary Hannibal Lecter character with more emotional depth, not plainly gory scenes.Here we are: the *violence* is what disturbed me the most of this film, compared to the other two in the trilogy. I hate overt violence depicted in films as such violence causes real violence we live through in our daily lives. Scientific studies prove this, no need for me to ramble about this here. The Hannibal Lector trilogy had, in my humble opinion, the original aim of trying to grasp hold psychologically of the horrors a man like Hannibal Lecter has inside him. In this film, ""Hannibal"", all is perverted to mere flashy effects (e.g. the brain-eating scene: repugnant, absolutely repugnant), poor characterization of the persons (the disfigured Verger, why were there minutes and minutes and minutes we have to look at his horrible face??) and a very clear intention of making even more money, the easy way, this time.I am not alone, another commenter here has also expressed his disgust and I commend him for that.

A tale of revenge on the part of one of Hannibal's former patients, and a tale of redemption for Julianne Moore's Clarice Starling, this film works on these polite levels and more. The setting of most of the film, in Italy, lends a feeling of dramatic tragedy and is well-served by its inclusion in this movie. If the movie has weakness, it may be the dullness of the inter-office politics int he beginning of the film (though, yes, I know that it is an important component in establishing her motivations for the rest of the film). Also, the movie could have left out the unrequited romance between Starling and her FBI boss, played by Ray Liotta. For those who keep score, if I had to rank them I'd say Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal, then Red Dragon (a remake of the original Manhunter).

Anthony is the only one worth watching.,6,30 June 2020,"I enjoyed the first movie quite a bit because it had the investigative suspense and the known drawn all over the place. The acting was superb by parties involved.The same cannot be said about this one. My issues with this movie are:1. The feds do not seem to be genuine nor interested in doing their jobs at all. Apart from Clarice, no one wants to do any investigation. They made the bureau look like Internal Affairs in L&O SVU which doesn't really seem fitting given the background from the first movie.2. The character appeal of Clarice was just taken away. She was not appealing because she looked and acted badass. She was appealing because she was smart and had great critical thinking and investigative abilities. None of that was actually shown in this movie. Furthermore, she seemed to lack some of the moral values she had in the first movie by saving Hannibal and killing the people who wanted him dead. Yeah they were bad guys, but not as bad as Hannibal. Then she essentially let him loose, which is a real risk she knew she was taking.3. Pretty much everyone in the movie is bad. The Italian cop, most of the feds. This does not go well with the story shown in the movie largely because it isn't about some conspiracy or whatsoever. The bureau putting all pressure on Clarice, for things she was clearly not guilty of, seems like a cheap way of pushing her towards Hannibal even though she wanted his arrest all way through. It just seems too scripted.4. Hannibal's escape takes so much from the threat of his character. Yes, it was somewhat the point the movie is trying to make, that he loved Clarice so much he ended up severing his own hand instead of hers to escape. But frankly I had no doubt he was going to do that when the scene came. He was predictable which took a lot of his character development and his suspense.5. Too much unnecessary gore. The first movie had some gore going for it, but it was minimized to show horror and demonstrate how dangerous Hannibal is. The gore in this was seems to have been done just for the sake of doing it.",Hannibal

481,TheFilmGuru,"Off to la VITA NUOVA (""The New Life""), Clarice. But not in the movies !",9,3 September 2001,"Subject: ""The Ending You'll Never Forget!"" (Tagline to DVD ""Special Edition"") So there are SPOILERS.Considering the amount of anxious pressure that Dino & Martha DE LAURENTIS were exerting upon Thomas Harris to finish his epic-length  third 'Hannibal' novel (which would promptly be reduced to the short story minimum, with serious departures, that Steven Zaillian could adapt to Ridley Scott's film version), this literary 'instant classic' may appear to severely undermine the almost-perfect qualities of this film.""Almost-,"" that is, considering that bizarre ending, contrived for whatever reasons, which so distinctly is NOT that of the ca. 600 page novel. But I would like to partly defend the Scott-Zaillian(-Harris ?) decisions. Because the movie DOES work well, thematically, if not exactly as narration ! In fact, what is great about the film is that it so perfectly re-presents the aesthetics of the central Dantean Love Sonnet (see 'opera' piece) within the context of the leitmotiv of 'The Dantean Mind of Hannibal Lecter' in the novel(s). The all-consuming ""dark love story"" (Hans Zimmer, MUSIC) between ""Clarice"" (Julianne Moore's more-experience, hence more disillusioned) ""Starling"" and her dark guardian-angel, ""Hannibal,"" at first enjoying his 'Paradise Re-gained"" of Florence (""with a view""), is given its just due in this film adaptation.And there IS a great amount of the psychological battle-of-wits involved in ""Dr. Lecter's"" subtle 'seduction-of-Evil' correspondence (from the obligedly-chaste 'courtly-love' distance of a FBI fugitive, far from his ""straight arrow"" Special Agent); doomed as they might appear, to never consummate their affair as ""star-crossed lovers"" (Ridley Scott). There, we might see one critical departure; i.e., for that (the Shakespearean) pair of ill-destined lovers in the different corrupt ""City State"" (""Fair Verona"" rather than ""Florence""/""Washington, D.C."") ! Which explains, perhaps, certain departures. What IS masterfully maintained is the corruption !Apart from all the evidence of Dantean 'poetic justice' retributions, which the film takes straight from the novels, there is the serious flaw of attributing ""the mash note"" (even if it's being on a postcard of a particular William Blake painting IS a fine touch !) to ""Mason Verger"" (""He didn't write it, because I did !""-- Gary Oldman); i.e., to his fraudulent machinations and manipulation of the Justice Dept. and FBI. The message, in form of Lecter's 'esoteric' Old Testament reference to ""the answer to Samson's Riddle"": ""the honey in the lion,"" is NOT just 'something Lecter would say'. It is the essence of the 'beatific purity' of Clarice, as her 'Beatrice' to Hannibal's 'Dante', among the corrupt and cynical of ""that stale bureaucracy"" of the ""Krendlers"" (Ray Liotta), ""Vergers,"" and others : ""the Philistines"" who would betray 'the true Israelite' at every turn :""I thought, to begin with, you might tell me how you're feeling.""""About what?""""The masters you serve and how they've treated you. Your career, such as it is. Your life, Clarice."" ...""You serve the idea of Order, Clarice. They don't. You believe in the oath you took. They don't. You feel it is your duty to protect the sheep. They don't. They don't like you because you're not like them. They hate you and they envy you. They are weak and unruly and believe in nothing.""Since this exchange captures the sense of Hannibal's elliptic Biblical reference, the alteration can be excused somewhat. Indeed, this very aspect of the film's diegesis (the world of womanly purity bound to corrupt 'City-State') is the option which justifies the decisions on 'ending' (even the ""Never-Before-Seen Alternate Ending"" [DVD]). It may be as simple a thing as the decision that the horrific of 'the happy cannibal-couple' would be too much for audiences : the actual ""New Life"" succumbing of Clarice to the cynical wisdom of our (best of all the previous Hollywood attempts to depict Nietzsche's so-called ""Blond Beast""/'Superman') epitome of evil, as an Uebermensch ""beyond Evil."" And, while the film's ending supports one equally Dantean reading of the story, the novel fully explodes the twisted narrative of perverse chivalry in an almost literal (cannibalistic) reading of the ""New Life"" sonnet's all-consuming passions.""Then, unaware, she ate his heart."" (From the novel: ""Inspector Pazzi"" (Giancarlo Giannini), on his 'high maintenance' wife (Francesca Neri).]But the cinematic aesthetic production values are superb, and rich enough in literary culture and historical mise-en-scene to validate the claim to : ""as compelling a film as you will ever see"" (Joel Siegel, ""Good Morning America"") and other accolades.",Hannibal

Very happy with all the extra's on it like some deleted scenes. Some of them are really needed in the final version I find (like the one that explains how Hannibal gets so quick to America after killing Pazzi and a scene in the perfume shop that shows how Hannibal already knows Pazzi is on his tail) Very nice is also the deleted scene that explains how it comes Pazzi has a password for accessing the FBI site. Less good is the alternate scene of the jogging sequence that turns Hannibal into a kind of fetishist and pervert instead of the real cool and calculated serial killer as we know him. The alternate ending (available on disc 2) is rather stupid and I'am very happy that it didn't made it to the final version.
The DVD is really one you must have in your collection. More then 3 hours of extra's (Several making of docu's ,trailers, + 700 production stills) and a superb multiangle extra of the fishmarket scene. 'Just when you tought you've seen all about multi angles on DVD there was Hannibal' I would say. The directors commentary by Scott is great and in detail. This is the first DVD I have where even the directors commentary is subtitled.Let's hope this movie gets some nominations for the Academy Awards. If it was up to me (but it's not :-) ) I would suggest at least a nomination for Best Actor (Hopkins is yummmiee ! ),Best Director, Best supporting actor (Oldman) Photography,and Best Score.

487,unklechunkle,A flawed but memorable psychological thriller nonetheless,7,30 May 2012,"I approached Hannibal with an obvious comparison to The Silence of the Lambs, the Oscar-winning prequel which I consider one of my favourite films of all time. Unfortunately, I found Hannibal to be very underwhelming, it does not live up to Silence, which never fails to chill me to the core.The plot starts ten years after the events of Silence of the Lambs. Starling (Julianne Moore) has hit a low point in her career after a botched drug raid. Meanwhile, Mason Verger (played by a virtually unrecognisable Gary Oldman), the only surviving victim of Hannibal Lecter, plans to capture the brilliant serial killer, who is posing as an academic in Florence, where he come under the radar of Inspector Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini).The major weakness of this film was its inability to really scare the audience. It has its moments, the infamous brain-eating scene is prominent, but I feel that the character of Hannibal was over-exposed in this film, IE you see too much of him whereas in Silence, there was very little which made his screen presence so large. As much as Julianne Moore is a good actress, her portrayal of Starling is far removed from the vulnerability that Jodie Foster brought to the role. The film does have its strengths though. Anthony Hopkins and Gory Oldman are both on top-form as the titular protagonist and the deranged Verger. Ray Liotta is also good as the morally ambiguous Krendler. While it doesn't live up to its predecessor, Hannibal is a shocking and memorable thriller",Hannibal
488,rwd4evr,"Compelling, but Flawed",8,23 March 2004,"As a big (big, big) fan of Thomas Harris' 1999 novel, I literally counted the days to the release of the film and was one of the first on line. Surrounded by a few hundred of my fellow Lecterphiles, I sat for two hours, drinking it in.  It was a treat seeing the characters step off the page to walk and talk...but still, I left the theater feeling quite let down. 
The musical score was sublime.  Most of the actors did a fine job.  The problem was twofold.  First, the ending differed markedly from what was given in the book.  No spoilers; if you liked the book you've seen the movie already.  If you didn't like the book, you still know what the ending was. Just suffice it to say, Ridley Scott and Stephen Zaillian took a safer route.  Kind of like taking the safe route through Yellowstone because you're afraid of getting squirted by Old Faithful.Another objection I had to this movie was the excessive gore.  The whole story is supposed to have a dreamy, other-worldly quality, and the rivers of blood and lingering closeups on various no-longer-internal organs is a turnoff that does nothing to aid the story.  I'm told the DVD contains many deleted scenes, and this is good, because the theatrical version was choppily edited.  I walked away thinking there was so much they could have added to maximize the impact.  The sound quality was less than ideal.  Even with Dolby, the audience strained to catch mumbled lines. 
Even those of us who can never quite get enough of Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter are rather unanimous in our belief that we've had more than enough of Ridley Scott's disregard for fine literature.RWD4EVR",Hannibal

I had readthe book and was really looking forward to the film.  I neverexpected it to reach the same heights that Silence of The Lambsdid, but I was hoping for a good companion to that great film. When I left the theater I was very disappointed.  Last week I sawthe film for the second time on cable, and it's really not that bad.  Infact the first hour and a half are quite good.  It's when Hannibalcomes to America that the film does a total nose dive.The film is gorgeous to look at during it's first half in Italy, andHopkins does a good job of giving the audience that subtle feelingof uneasiness that made his performance in SOTL so great.  Thepacing feels right and the plot unfolds well, climaxed by a nastydeath scene of the inspector.  Then when the film shifts gears andHannibal comes back to the states, the tone, and smartness of theplot just goes away.  It felt as if entire chunks of the plot were cutout so the movie wouldn't play too long.  After taking so much timeto build tension with Hannibal being discovered and stalked inItaly, Ridley Scott builds no tension at all during the climactic pigeating scene.  It just sort of happens.  Two things that really brought the film down during the second halfare the characters of Mason Verger and Clarice Starling. The toneof the Verger character never felt right.  Am I supposed to fear thisguy or laugh at him?  It never seemed clear.  The make-up job onhim seemed a little off as well.  To be honest, it was hard to look athim and not think of Jim Carrey's Fireman character from In LivingColor.  I don't think that is what the director had in mind.  Andalthough Juliane Moore is a fine actress she just seems out ofplace in this film.  It's not her fault.  No one could have replacedJodie Foster.  The scene with Hopkins and Moore at theamusement park fails miserably and seems all together pointless.  In the controversial final scene I had gotten to the point where I justdidn't care anymore.  There is nothing less scary then seeingHopkins dressed like a butler making dinner, even if he is cookinga man's brain.

Scott paces the film like the way Hopkins plays Lecter: slow and methodical.  It works for Lecter who is creepy and truly terrifying because he is so calm and patient.  However pacing the film this way doesn't create for any suspense or terror, but rather it is irritating and boring.

Lots of bullets, lots of bodies, (they even make the quarry a fully pregnant lady), our hero gets unjustifiably suspended and then takes matters into his own hands, or her hands in this case. Please, this corny crap has been used countless times in TV serials and cheap action movies, like some Bruce Willis flick - I am surprised Thomas Harris could even bring himself to write this!Then comes the ridiculous deformed character in wheelchair who somehow is super rich and powerful and who has such a superb network of intelligence and runners that they manage to catch Hannibal Lecter when for years the FBI failed despite him being on their ten most wanted list - Wah, am I watching a James Bond movie or what?!The story moves at a tedious pace with Ridley Scott crafting his pseudo artistic style more suitable to a reflective drama than a crime thriller. The suspense, if there is any, is as flat as walking through your neighbourhood grocery store.There is even such cheap thrill as hungry pigs eating humans. And the climax where Lecter does a haute cuisine of human brain, rather than being the stomach churner it was intended to be, instead looks delicious as watching a French master chef preparing his signature dish - it actually got me thinking of having pig brain for dinner! No kidding.And yeah, you may half expect Hannibal Lecter to break out ""Night time sharpens, heightens each sensation..."" when he bends over Clarice Starling.This movie is a prime example of the kind of product we get when greedy Hollywood executives try to cash in on a successful film by pushing the creation of a sequel. In the process, quality becomes trash, and The Silence Of The Lambs has become The Gobbling Of The Pigs.This movie would be forgivable if it is a typical Bruce Willis-type action flick.

I found the gore in the film to be way over the top and unnecessary- SOTL didnt need excessive amounts of blood letting to be a genuine horror film.

It can even be called equal to it's breathtaking predecessor.That is, until the last ten minutes.  Yes, those all too infamous ten minutes of footage that sent a collective groan of disgust through the over crowded theater opening night.It is unfortunate that these blindingly gory scenes ruin many people's view of this otherwise great film.  Yes, it's graphic, but during the first two hours, the gore and violence is used to film's advantage, depicting just how serious the crimes of Dr. Hannibal Lecter are.  However, the infamous ""dinner"" sequence uses this shock-horror factor to such a degree that it loses all seriousness and just becomes ridiculous.I was shocked that such great writing talent didn't utilize the lost art of implication to accomplish the same thing (probably much more effectively) that this disgusting version did.Speaking of the kitchen scene, did anyone else notice the copy of ""Vegetarian Cuisine"" on top of the refrigerator behind Clarice's head?

I spent most of my time trying to fit Ms. Moore into the character she was supposed to portray.  She never came through on any emotion that she tried to convey.

I understand that even killer has complex human emotions, but Dante has nothing to do with killing a man like that. If a man who masters literature and history could judge other people's life as his wish, then how should we estimate Hitler? I know it's just a film but since Anthony Hopkins' performing is too great, I couldn't help but feel upset for quite a while. We all admit Godfather is great, because whatever he did he insist his principle that family profit is most important, he also had his love and hate but if he showed up with Dante that would be totally unreasonable. I don't like those script writers who add metaphysical meanings onto slaughter just for making a film looks more mystic and attractive. And that female FBI upset me too, why she saved H while she knew she couldn't control the situation by herself? The director did a good job, as well as composer Hans Zimmer. But for me the problem is they are too moderate, I mean, the way the camera rolls, the scenes switch, and the actors perform, just too Hollywood.

503,lisapoet,Foul After-Taste,7,10 February 2001,"After months of anticipation, I left the theater with an odd hollow sensation. almost as if I hadn't seen the right movie. I found myself wondering who had written the screenplay and if he had even bothered to read the last section (Part VI: A Long Spoon) of Thomas Harris' psychological thriller. In the interim between reading and watching _Hannibal_, I had even almost reconciled myself to the fact that Jodie Foster would not be returning as Special Agent Starling.What Hollywood and Ridley Scott did to _Hannibal_, however, cannot be reconciled quite so easily. Mr. Scott reduced several key characters and events to mere charicatures or blips on the screen, and in some cases, eliminated them entirely. He then, for some unknown reason, chose to elevate the character of a whining pissant of a boy to the level of a precocious young lad, while completely eliminating his entirely annoying and ignorant mother from a plane scene that actually occurs during Dr. Lecter's return to America. In consideration of those erased, I will mention for your consideration, the following: Margot Verger, Jack Crawford, Ardelia Mapp, and perhaps most significantly, the story of Mischa and Clarice's own angst over her father's death.The movie spends entirely too much time on the shooting of Evelda Drumgo and the actions of Paul Krendler, while leaving out entirely the impact the death of John Brigham had on Clarice. Krendler is reduced to being a leering pervert with a grudge against Clarice rather than the true misogynistic homophobe that he really was.As a psychological thriller, _Hannibal_ is flat and the new ending is almost trite. Did Scott and the makers of _Hannibal_ really think so little of their potential audience that they felt it necessary to eviscerate what was a beautifully crafted work? Anthony Hopkins was amazing, Julianne Moore was palatable, but the movie itself left a bad aftertaste in my mouth. Read the book, but don't expect much more than choppy, graphic, gratuitous gore from the movie. and a typical Hollywood cliff-hanger ending suitable for a predictable sequel.",Hannibal

The rest of the cast though were just there to make up the numbers or to be fodder for Hopkins.Gary Oldman was more over the top even than usual,and Ray Liotta seemed lobotomised long before the ending.How can David Mamet,the same man who wrote the sublime Glengarry Glenross be involved in a movie with such poor characterisation as was on show here?

However I have two complaints, one, it didn't have the same dark atmosphere that made Silence of the Lambs and Manhunter so good, and two, although it did stick to the book (if you've read it this is a spoiler) the ending was dramatically different which gave an entirely different feel to the power of Hannibal Lecter's character.

I've always enjoyed her and this is no exception.  But of course the main force here is Sir Hopkins.  His performance is beyond words it's that great.  He continues right where he left off, making us hate him and feel some sort of affection and connection with him at the same time. Gary Oldman, who is completely unrecognizable, is wonderful, as always. And I cannot end this without mentioning two other aspects of this film.  One is the music.  It's so hypnotic and beautiful and truly plays upon your emotions.  The next is every scene shot in Florence: stunningly beautiful, gorgeous beyond words.  The historic buildings and landmarks plays into the spooky and beautiful aspect of this film.  And lets not forget how scary it can be.

The other violence in the film seemed to follow the same pattern.I can't see any reason for Hannibal's character to start cutting people's heads open for no reason.  If the purpose was to disgust the audience, they did a good job.  This is the only movie I have ever seen that has made me even slightly nauseous.  However, where was hannibal's ""cleverness?""  He seems to have thrown it out entirely, and it was a real letdown.In fact, I guess the whole brain thing is my only gripe.

Hannibal has a beautiful score but some times the bups are lifted wrong and make some scenes a little odd. Hopkins is Hannibal and returns for another cannibalistic performance. The acting is somewhat dry and falls in parts. Also the story seems to mop around the old SOTL formula, and into a more horrific tone. But this is not a bad thing. It gets away from repeating the same style, but it does have some parts that felt very useless.

514,mysticzine,"Awful, simply awful",2,19 July 2002,"Having just watched Silence of the Lambs for the nth time, I am reminded of all the reasons Hannibal is an awful failure. Perhaps it is not fair to compare the two films, however the comparison is inevitable.Silence establishes such a powerful, realistic, bleak tone that would go on to inspire tv and film for the next decade (can you say X-files?).  The characters were so wonderfully complex and interesting. The relationship between Clarice and Lector evolved as a sort of dance, each following the other's lead. Hannibal attempts to further this relationship, but becomes bogged down by its own grandure. The tone and style are so grandiose and operatic, that everything else is completely drowned out. The characters have even been so warped that their actions are not their own. I never felt that what they were doing truly fit their character. (The scene in which Lector lures Clarice into the mall with the telephone game comes close, but ultimately seems like a pale imitation of Silence.) Perhaps the biggest problem, though, is that Hannibal never comes across as more than Friday the 13th: The Opera. Whereas Silence scares in a very subconcious reasonating way, Hannibal goes for cheap scares and gory effects. For example, in Silence, Clarice, not the audiece, is shown a photo of the nurse Lector ravaged. In Hannibal, a video tape of the incident is shown, causing a momentary jump, but nothing more. Ultimately, Hannibal is more a creation of the desire to hear Anthony Hopkins utter ""hello Clarice...."" once more than a realization of a true artistic vision.",Hannibal
515,GUYspm,entertaining trash (spoilers),7,30 May 2003,"We are presented with ""Hannible"", the sequel to Jonathan Demme's oscar winning masterpiece ""Silence of the Lambs"". For this film, we have a superb director and an extremely talented cast starring Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore being directed by Ridley Scott.So whats the problem?The main problem of the film comes from Thomas Harris's source novel. Reading it I could tell that he had the potential for a great story with an exciting plot but got so tired of these characters that he took the easy way out. The film never reaches the depths that its predecessor plunderd into and this film and the book made the biggest mistake of all. That mistake being taking Hannibal out of his cell. Once out of his cell, this character becomes infinitly less interesting. All he becomes is a extremely intelligent killer with a taste for fine arts and rare food. Another problem with the film is that the predecessor was about the exploration of the Clarice Starling character and that is completely gone from this one simply because in the novel from which the film is based, there is nothing to discover. There are some positive aspects to this film.Ridley Scott shows that he is a master of is craft by taking a trashy book and making it something entertaining and at some points such as the ""dinner"" scene and ""kitchen"" scene show some depth that elevate the film above its trashy roots. Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore do their character justice by playing them as well as they can depite the scripts limitaions.On another note, I must commend Scott on the ending to the film which is infinitely more emotionally powerfull as compared to the books. Scott also handles the gory scenes with enough class as to avoid typical horror movie ""cheesyness"". Also, with any Ridley Scott film, the Cinematography and Locations  are wonderfull.In the end though, see this film and decide what you think of it",Hannibal
516,csharpe357,"Superb From Start To Finish, Criminally Underrated",9,11 November 2011,"This movie is superb, i strongly believe that those that didn't enjoy it did not or perhaps cannot appreciate its finer points. I don't know what people were expecting but i watched this alone and still gave a round of applause when the credits rolled.Its a deep and interesting story because while Hannibal is a killer, and of course a gruesome cannibal, everyone he killed in some way deserved it, and if you've read the books you will know that the trauma Hannibal suffered as a child goes a long way to excuse him. So the films begs the viewer the question as to his morality, and his punishment if any at all. The viewer perhaps will grow to like Hannibal, and so will be presented with many philosophical quandaries as the film progresses, would they rather see him jailed or free, alive or dead?Hannibals interaction with Agent Starling is a fascinating one, wrought with sexual and psychological tension as agent Starling and the viewer both *feel* that Hannibal wouldn't harm her, but you are never quite sure and neither is she.The pace of the film builds up to a climactic finish which doesn't give itself away until the very end. You are always guessing, will they run away together? will he kill her? will she kill him? will she hand him into the police? will he escape? Watch it and see.I would say that this film doesn't hold your hand, there are a lot of finer details which may be unappreciable to those who haven't read the books or at least seen the ""dragon rising"" movie which explains Hannibals childhood. Many will be dismayed by the end because they think that Hannibal is meant to be a cardboard cut out villain, he isn't, and they're wrong, this is a fantastic movie.",Hannibal

518,kowalski_91,Better than 'The Silence of the Lambs',7,23 April 2005,"While I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Silence of the Lambs,' it is not fairly compared to 'Hannibal.' I am a huge fan of intelligent horror movies, and 'Hannibal' was definitely what I was looking for.Two (?) years after Ridley Scott's Oscar winning 'Gladiator,' 'Hannibal' dominated the box office with an amazing $250M+ gross..... and horrible reviews. It seems that today, critics only like soft-hearted dramas, and warm and fuzzy children's' films; shunning any other genre like a child with broccoli. 'Hannibal,' apart from some explicit gore, and violent themes, was, for the most part, intelligent.Although Jodie Foster was not casted in the sequel to the 1991 BEST PICTURE, 'Hannibal' was still an amazing accomplishment, and a landmark in the film industry. Julianne Moore gives a stellar performance as Special Agent Clarice Starling, despite the confining 'closet' size of her role (great analogy, eh?), and should have been up for a nomination. Anthony Hopkins is just as great as he always is, and always has been, and successfully portrays Lecter as the unnerving sociopath we have all grown to love.'Hannibal''s only downfall was that it was un-decided in being either a horror or a drama. The use of 'scary music', and suspenseful scenes was lacking, and the use of distorted film was sometimes annoying.Rent, nay, purchase this fine film (special collectors edition, not regular) ****/5",Hannibal
519,JamShake-101,Food For Thought,6,7 July 2021,"Possessing a subtle air of aimlessness, 'Hannibal' nonetheless serves up an undeniably watchable, if somewhat hollow follow up to 'Silence of the Lambs'. If the latter represents the vintage offering, 'Hannibal' is without doubt the lesser sibling, a non-vintage blend of solid thriller tropes, horror inflections and competent direction and performances.I've previously reviewed 'Hannibal Rising', and whilst that unashamedly gorges on Silence's successes, this perhaps lightly chews, retaining its dignity and independence. Indeed, on the contentious issue of Moore's casting, I think that she often gets unjustified bad press. Yes, the chemistry does not match that of Foster and Hopkins, and the reduced interactions simmer rather than sparkle. Scott and Moore don't try to simply imitate what has come before however, rather to play with echoes of that relationship whilst forging something new. Like much of the film, it doesn't always work, sometimes coming off a little flat, but neither Moore nor Scott are due scathing criticism.Some of the fault also lies with the script and source material rather than actor or director, as the evocative sense of mystery that facilitated Lecter's ominous allure, Starling's fragile strength and Silence's complex, relationship-driven appeal, dissipates. The characters are less intense, the tension greatly reduced, and as a result, the central relationship that formed the crux of Silence's success feels rather absent and empty by comparison. Perhaps given the lack of chemistry with Moore as Starling, this reduced focus isn't ultimately the worst thing that could happen, and again, you can applaud Scott's efforts to present something a little different whilst also recognising its faults.Like the blatantly touted Dean & Deluca, the series has had its highs and its lows (at points extreme), but overall it retains its hallmark of good quality. Silence and TV's 'Hannibal' remain the high points, but all things considered, this is a solid, 'catch on TV and watch to conclusion' 6/10.",Hannibal

Well, I went in not expecting much.  I wasn't disappointed.  Hopkins was excellent, of course, and Julianne Moore was ok, but it just wasn't the same without Foster.  I think the screenplay was weak.  Did they have to write in all of the Italians smoking so much?  It was so cliche, it was ridiculous.  Also, how many times do we have to hear ""corn pone/country p*ssy""?  C'mon...we all know Starling is from white trash, as Hopkins so outstandingly pointed out in SOTL, but the repetition of this line was ridiculous.  The movie was good in its own right, but IMO,it lacked a lot.  It could have been spectacular...and it just wasn't.  I was more than happy to have Varger get his just rewards, just to shut up his whiney voice.  I mean...if there has to be a villian, does he have to be nasal?  Jame Gumb was a nasaly-whiney voiced character, and now we have Varger.  It was ridiculous.  Obviously absent was the psychological thriller aspect...and also absent was good writing for Hopkins.

In the middle of thisbyzantine plot is Julianne Moore as disgraced agent Clairce Starling. Lecter is in splendor retirement in Florence Italy. He is also being followed by a struggling police detective who has discovered Lecters identity. In Lambs Lecter was evil personified and captured the whole film indelibly.

In a reversal of fortune, Clarice seems to be in the cage most of this movie while Hannibal gets to play in historic, classic, cultural Florence.I doubt that Julianne will follow Jodie's path at the Academy Awards, but there should be a few nominations for this Dino De Laurentiis film. I would think that Hopkins may be challenged for the repeat by Oldman's -- man of 1000 faces -- performance. Nominations for direction, screenplay and supporting actors would also seem to be forth coming -- if this film is not forgotten at nomination time.It was great seeing Giancarlo Giannini (as Rinaldo Pazzi) in a pivotal role in a major American movie. The star of ""Swept Away"" and ""Seven Beauties"" from a generation ago brings depth and experience to his protagonist role in the search.My favorite parts of the novel have been brought to the screen in a visual terror befitting the director of ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"". True, there is significant blood on the screen, however the real horror is reserved for our intellectual discovery of the sociopathic mind. Would you expect less from David Mamet?This film is more like the first Hannibal movie ""Manhunter"" then ""Silence of the Lambs"". In this series, it seems that each sequel gets better.Five Stars. I can not wait to see it again.",Hannibal
524,bsilva,Exquisitely sophisticated and gruesome. A must see,9,23 February 2001,"It's incredible how after 2 hours of watching the incredible chain of events happen through the character of Hannibal (magnificently portrayed by Anthony Hopkins), I ended up not disliking ""Hannibal"" despite everything he does. The film is magnificent and full of rich messages about today's society of everybody eating everybody else to try and reach some degree of power in our frantic society. The film must be seen with an open mind, way beyond the physical violence present in it. Julianne Moore is an excellent Clarice, probably even better than Jodie, so there's no loss. There are no words to describe Anthony Hopkins performance. And Verger (the mystery actor you can only discover in the end credits) is astounding. This film is definitely not for the weaker persons but if you are not impressionable it is a brilliant masterpiece of psychological terror. Ridley Scott proves that he can do a sequel much better than the original.",Hannibal
525,genedurham,I love this movie!,10,11 February 2001,"I thought this movie was totally great. But I must warn you though, you should really read the book then see the movie. It's not a necessity to enjoy the movie but it will help you understand it a little better. It seemed that splices of the necessary scenes to help you understand what was going on were left out when the script was written. Of course this would have made the movie significantly longer. I think for the Florence scenes you really have to have an appreciation for history and Italy for that matter. Of course many people were bored during these scenes. Myself included at a few points. The Florence scenes had me wishing for the climax. As a previous person commented about asking why, I honestly just have to say READ THE BOOK. You will know why then. And it all really won't seem like ""an episode from Tales From the Crypt."" If you read the book and still didn't understand, well then I pity you. The script managed to weave humor into the plot very well. Tony Hopkins played Hannibal Lecter once again very well. But this time round I think the screenplay was trying to make you dislike Dr. Lecter more than the first. And for me it succeeded. I honestly didn't like him at all. But in the book I was rooting for him. All in all this is an enjoyable film. Don't let the ones who were disappointed by the fact that they were going in for ""The Silence of The Lambs 2"" but got ""Hannibal"" a film that can stand on its own and doesn't need its predecessor instead.",Hannibal
526,Zhaz,Very disappointing...,5,16 February 2001,"Hannibal was not the movie that I was expecting.  I went in to see it without comparing it to its predecessor, The Silence of the Lambs, but rather as a stand-alone movie, and it fell flat on its face to me.After the movie, I wondered where it went wrong, whether it was the script by David Mamet and Steven Zaillian, the directing by Ridley Scott, the editing by Pietro Scalia or the acting by the principal actors.  Hans Zimmer's score also did nothing for me this time round, unlike his previous efforts.  The movie just seemed to fail.The things I did enjoy about the movie was Anthony Hopkins performance.  I think he is a brilliant actor, but like other people have pointed out, he wasn't given much to work with this time around.  I also liked John Mathieson's cinematography, he captured the locations beautifully.Julianne Moore's character of Clarice Starling wasn't given much to do this time either, I felt she spent most of the time sitting in the FBI room with the computers and Dr. Lecter evidence around her.  But then it really isn't Clarice's story this time around.This was a disappointing movie for me and I couldn't really recommend it, and as for the infamous scene at the end, all it did was make the people around me feel sick.  It probably should have been cut down so it had less screen time.5/10",Hannibal
527,Edoardo Costa,awful!,1,16 February 2001,"What is there to say... Silence of the lambs was a classic and Jodie Foster made the film.  Not having her in the sequel meant it was not even worth contemplating.The film is slow, the script is poor and the plot non existent!What a shame.",Hannibal

529,ebohls,It Doesn't Stink,4,19 February 2001,"Spoiler Considering that the book was unforgettably bad, that the movie comes in at unmemorable I'd have to say is a good thing.The movie dispenses with the annoying Barnie & sister subplot, as well as the silly and monumentally unnecessary origin of Lecter story. I was sad to see the book's ending changed, however much I hated the rest of the book. The ending of the book sure wasn't what I expected, and I liked being surprised.The greatness of ""Silence of the Lambs"" comes from the ta-ta-tension in the meetings and discussions between Agent Starling and Dr. Lecter. ""Hannibal"" has them apart except for the (now famous) dinner scene at the end, spending all of its capital on setting up a villain worse than Lecter and straining to find some way for Starling to have to save Lecter. Yawn.The movie blows the ending not by keeping Starling committed to her principles, which is more believable but less fun than the book's ending, but by having Lecter declare (almost) his love to her.At least he also declares the truth about love (and handcuffs): ""This is going to hurt quite a bit.""Chop!",Hannibal
530,rodan-4,Tastes like crusty leftovers,1,14 February 2001,"Don't believe the hype, Hannibal is a truly drab piece of garbage (I hope not to offend garbage). Like the extremely mediocre 'Gladiator', 'Hannibal' is a perfect example of style over substance. While I loved Ridley Scott's 'Alien', 'Blade Runner', and 'Thelma and Louise', his new outing is senseless w***ing. The plot is very stagnant (like a sagging erection) and failed to put my friends and I in any state of suspense. While 'Lambs' gave off an extremely creepy claustrophobic vibe and a lurking sense of evil (Hannibal's scenes revolved around very restricted space that only hightened the tension) the ""sequel"" let Hannibal roam around free as a lamb. Starling in the 1st film was an eager, clever girl but here she is just depressed and one dimensional Did he have any motivation in this picture? I think not. Did this movie scare me? Not in the least. Instead Scott goes for laughter that is very ""look at how outrageous i am....how crazy and gore infested my celluloid images are"". Like Roger Ebert (whom I can feel is full of crap quite often) said 'this film is a gore fest that wishes to be great art'. Oh that's rich!!!! I wish Lecter stayed retired forever or maybe he should have became a bus driver or what not. Blame a bad script, direction cuz I think the actors are capable without a doubt. Just watch and see if you can find motivation behind the characters actions (Hannibal = 0% Starling 1% -capture bad dude, or kiss him?- Verger 1% -torture bad dude even though the audience doesn't completely know why he felt such anger towards me.......). This is a film that's aware of it's funniness (like the putrid, insipid 'Fight Club') despite being humorless. Sure the look of the the film is excellent but afterwards you may want to jump off a cliff. Wait for cable or the $1.99 bin. RATING: 2/10",Hannibal
531,seanc39,Hopkins is Terrifying,8,9 February 2001,"This is a good film, Anthony Hopkins is frightening once again.  I prefer Jodie Foster and the first film but I hate it when people get caught up in those comparisons.  This film stands on its own as a good film.  Ridley Scott direction, the sets, cinematography, performances and score are all great.  The film is hard to watch at times(like watching surgery), and definitely not for the squeamish, but this is what is so intriguing about the film, you can't take your eyes off of it.(3 stars out of 4)",Hannibal
532,ursulahx,A bit disappointing,5,30 May 2001,"Lacking the wit, verve and panache of Demme's original, this gruesome follow-up falls short on several counts. Without the character's surprise element,  Lecter becomes just another monster, though the audience is encouraged to root for him as the movie progresses, and Oldman the victim becomes the bad guy. Excellent though Julianne Moore is, she can't eclipse memories of Jodie Foster, and she is sidelined for great chunks of the film, which is a shame. Giancarlo Giannini's role is played out very predictably, and this rugged, impressive actor is not given justice to his talents. And, frankly, when the movie runs out of ideas, it ups the gore quotient (especially in the particularly emetic dinner sequence, which seems to be played at a slow pace deliberately to have the viewers vomiting in the aisles). Mamet's influence on the script is obvious in places, but you have to hunt for it the rest of the time, and can one really believe that these same talents were behind the masterpieces of The Spanish Prisoner, Thelma and Louise and Schindler's List? Oh, please.",Hannibal
533,markwilson,Critics may or may not love it but you will!,10,12 February 2001,"From reading preceding critical reviews, I've noticed there are 2 categories of people who did not like this movie. There are those who have unfairly compared it to the first movie, and those who didn't like Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling.The first criticism is an unfair one. Why do you grade a sequel based on its predecessor? Why can't you simply ask yourself the question, ""Was I entertained?"" ""Was the acting superb?"" ""Was the script superb?"" ""Was this thriller thrilling?"" I feel that Hannibal stands alone as a seperate movie. Even if you have never seen Silence of the Lambs, there is enough introduction of both characters to bring about an understanding of where they came from and who they are.  I was truly on the edge of my seat from the moment the MGM lion roared, and that's the bottom line for me.The second criticism is absolutely laughable. It's obvious that those that make that criticism did not examine Julianne Moore's portrayal objectively. The simply observed that Jodie Foster and Julianne Moore are not the same actress, and that's enough for them to pan Julianne Moore. Actually, if you want to be objective about it, Julianne Moore is BETTER as Clarice Starling. She is more believable, more weak and strong at the same time. Ask yourself this, ""Was Julianne more believable as Clarice?"" Yes. ""Was her acting superb?"" Yes. End of discussion.",Hannibal
534,popezaphod_I,Wishing Jonathan Demme Had Directed,7,9 February 2001,"""Hannibal"" was certainly thrilling.  Some scenes were grotesque - but in an intriguing way.  Hopkins was wonderful, and Moore was very good.  Many scenes had so much tension that your eyes felt taught.  But there was something missing.The film is not subtle.  ""The Silence of the Lambs"" built a lot of its tension on words and some on actions.  You got into Lecter's head and watched him get into Starling's.  But in ""Hannibal"" you don't have that kind of subtle interaction.  It's brash, and bold, and a Ridley Scott film - complete with ""Gladiator""-esque motion-shaking shots and other camera tricks.If Jonathan Demme had directed, I think that the psychological intrigue would have been more prevalent, that you would have feared Lecter's words more than his actions.  That's the movie I really wanted to see.Two final notes:  Gary Oldman is a treasure.  Ray Liotta should not have been in this movie.  Man, what a waste of screen time.",Hannibal
535,md006,Sequel surpasses Original,9,25 February 2001,"One thing these days about Hollywood films is that they waste time on poor sequels.  This is NOT the case in Hannibal.  This movie was extremely well acted by Sir Anthony Hopkins and most of all by Julianne Moore.  This movie also had its good share of really shocking parts that really helped the movie get as good as it is.  I dont want to ruin the ending, but it is definitely CLASSIC.  You only need to see this movie once to remember it. Usually I frown upon sequels overall, because they try and re-use old tricks from the original.  You don't need to see ""Silence of the Lambs"" to see this, because this movie really follows around Hannibal rather than use him like in SOTL to solve another plot point.  It almost makes you feel as if this movie isn't a ""sequel"", if you will, but more like a spin off.  This was a great movie and you should definitely see it.",Hannibal

I love the humor, the gore, the score, the acting, the story, the characters, the animal references throughout the film, etc.  It's all good.  I can't wait until it comes out on video/DVD.

538,James Birtwhistle,"Good film, good look, good killings",8,18 September 2001,"In my humble opinion, Hannibal' is as good as, if not better than, The Silence of the Lambs'. What? Burn him! It is, however, clearly different to it's predecessor in many ways. It's a lot more  I don't know  fun. Which is presumable why people don't like it as much. I lie  people do like it, just not enough to immortalise it as a classic'; it's a bit too fun' for people to include in their mental top ten movie lists. This matters very little, except that comparisons are bound to be drawn between Hannibal' and Silence'.And already I've fallen into the trap of comparing the two. In an ideal world I would review Hannibal' on its own merits rather than constantly comparing it to Silence', but an ideal world this is not, and so I will continueStylistically the films are very different. Hannibal' is just as dark as Silence', but it's a different kind of darkness. It is a glossy darkness. The whole film has a very sleek, shiny feel to it. It would be very hard for Hannibal' to share the more gritty, realist appearance of Silence' considering the beautiful European scenery. Julianne Moore plays a different Clarice Starling to Foster  one that fits the sleek, shiny mould of the film.   But enough of all this visually dynamic mumbo jumbo, let's get to the good stuff  the killings. And this is where Hannibal' excels. Not just killings, but gruesome disfiguring as well. I won't go into details, you can watch the film, but it is top stuff. But all the killings in the world could not satisfy me if they weren't done with the impeccable charms of the world's favourite cannibal. Anthony Hopkins plays the part of Hannibal magnificently.  In conclusion Hannibal' stands alone as a very good movie. Whether or not it's a very good sequel however, I really could not care less.8/10",Hannibal
539,kingcooger,People call this good?!?!?!? (Some Spoilers Contained),2,20 October 2002,"I'm sorry to go against the flow of almost everyone else who wrote reviews but I considered this to be a horrible film.  It was just a slapping together of violent events without much of a coherent story.If Hannibal, the man we feared so much in Silence, were on the loose do you think he would act like this.  He seems more of a comic then a killer.  The lines that Hopkins had to say were so campy I sometimes broke out in laughter at what is supposed to be a serious horror film.The story was barely passable.  The characters just ran about for seemingly no reason and everything Hannibal did seemed to have no drive.  There was no inner dialogue so it just seemed as if Hannibal was killing people for no reason.  SPOILER.  One person even told me at the end of the movie that they knew that the doctor who killed Mason Verger was a bad guy.  I'm sorry but the movie didn't even try to communicate how disgusting Verger was.  He was a child molester and yet they barely made a point of it.  Verger was the ultimate bad guy not Hannibal.  END SPOILER.Now that we've covered the horrible story lets move on to the horrible acting.  I must say that there was only one of the actors in this movie that I have any respect for (and believe it or not its not Anthony Hopkins). Giancarlo Giannini did a fine job acting in this film and I couldn't have been happier with his portrayal of his character.  Hopkins' lines were far too campy to take his acting seriously.  Ray Liotta has done better (Goodfellas and Blow).  Finally we come to Julianne Moore.  I guess all i can say is that she constantly looked shocked.  It didn't matter whether she was supposed to be sexy, serious, or even laughing because she always looked shocked.  Where was Jodie Foster when you needed her?  They should never have made this movie without her.The gore in this movie was also overdone and had no sense of art to it.If you liked this movie then read the book.  If you didn't like this movie (for reasons other then the gore) then read the book.  If you haven't seen this movie then don't even bother just read the book.  SPOILER.  The book does actually have an ending (unlike this dreadful waste of good money and film).  END SPOILER.  So to all you who say that this was good...I weep for you.",Hannibal

Instead of sitting with Demme and Foster and try to come up with a script that would please everybody, what did he do? Called Ridley Scott, and put Julianne Moore in the role of Clarice, both terrible choices. If Demme was a great surprise on taking the horror genre to another level, just like Kubrick had done with The Shining, Scott was a terrible option.But the worst thing was the terrible script, practically killing all characters emotion and attractive qualities.

541,carsonhuelle,Reason #1 to not make a sequel to a masterpiece.,3,21 July 2018,"The more you watch Hannibal, the more you question its existence. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) is now living in freedom after his escape in Silence of the Lambs. He lives in Italy and is a curator at a museum, sounds thrilling right? The same protagonist arises from its predecessor, Clarice Starling. Except for one change, Julianne Moore is playing her and not Jodie Foster. Her job throughout this film is really unclear and it doesn't help that Julianne Moore and Jodie Foster look nothing alike. Between the change of actress, messy plot and awful makeup on Gary Oldman's character, this movie seems to never find its stride. It was purely put out for the purpose of making money, not following any advice from its predecessor in the process. What made Silence of the Lambs great was the relationship Clarice had with Hannibal, helping her stop Buffalo Bill. We get none of that in this movie, all dull characters with no purpose. Part of the characters not having any significance is because of whoever cast this movie deserves a Razzie award. The film peaks in it's ""dinner scene"" but is ruined by Ray Liotta being in the movie, why is Ray Liotta in Hannibal? The world may never know. The only actor who puts on an above average performance is Anthony Hopkins, but nothing near his Oscar winning performance in the previous film. That is the only reason in watching this movie, curiosity. Curiosity in if Hannibal has any reminiscence of Silence of the Lambs.",Hannibal
542,twelvehousetwelve,Different Than Silence Of The Lambs,9,8 June 2017,"Silence Of The Lambs was creepy almost in a classic 1980s fashion like its predecessor Manhunter filmed in the 80s. Hannibal, on the other hand, has an updated feel most likely because of the advancement of film technology from 1991 to 2001. Simply put, films just got better during that decade. Quite a few critics like to contrast Silence with Hannibal, but there is no reason to do this. They are two different story lines shot completely differently from one another. What makes this film stand out over the other are the gruesome gory scenes filmed slowly, deliberately designed to test the squeamishness of the viewer. Silence is an amusement park haunted house where no one ever gets hurt, Hannibal is that same haunted house in which a murdering psychopath lives undetected. I don't recommend this film to anyone who is sensitive to torture scenes or sudden violent death scenes, no matter his or her age. And children should not see this film until they are old enough to fully grasp that there is evil in this world which is beyond what most of us ever experience--at least physically. Psychically is another matter altogether. At the end of the film Hannibal makes the statement that St. Paul hated women. This is patently untrue, but we must consider the source of the statement--a man with a seared conscience who enjoys his kills with as much relish as anyone who immerses himself in his favorite hobby.The blatant child abuse at the end of this film could have been avoided since it added nothing to the story whatsoever. But once again, we must consider the source of the abuse--and steel ourselves against the human nature inside all of us which could, and very easily, create psychopathic destruction given the perfect conditions. More and more the world in which we live becomes that cesspool of perfect bacterial conditions.",Hannibal
543,JonB,Few redeeming features,5,23 February 2001,"It's hard to figure out what Ridley Scott wanted to do with this film. On the one hand it has quite a simple, yet effective, plot, but on the other it just seems to feature extremely graphic scenes, which are intended to disgust and cause revulsion. There is no doubt that the visual effects are superb, but why would anyone want to actually see them in all their detail?It's a disappointing effort from Scott, no way on a par with his Alien films or, more recently, with Gladiator. If you want to watch a psychological thriller featuring a serial killer then you'd be better off with Silence of the Lambs, Kiss the Girls, the Gingerbread Man or the Cell.As for the acting: It's very much touch-and-go. Hopkins is back as Lecter, but doesn't develop the character any  further than the first film. Moore is very different from the Agent Starling of ""Silence of the Lambs"", and borders on wooden for most of the film. The other actors, such as the FBI chiefs and the Justice Dept. guy, just seemed like stereotypes found in other films (see US Marshals, X-Files). Even Lecter's archenemy, Verger, was an uninspiring performance from Gary Oldman.Overall this film just seemed aimed at evoking strong feelings in the audience, with little content. The only positive thing I can say about it is that it didn't fall into the trap so many other's in this genre do - of trying to lighten the atmosphere with comedy. There was always a sense of foreboding and a darkness which didn't let up at all.",Hannibal

Jodie Foster's absence is also notable, it's like you're just to forget she was in the first one and none of the characters are likeable, except for the hogs I guess.

I have to say that this film was very slowly paced and lacked the excitement and suspense of both Hannibal the novel and the previous films -Manhunter and The Silence of the Lambs.For me the best part of the novel was the part in Florence when Pazzi had to get Hannibal's fingerprint using the Romanian Gypsy's. This part was cut down heavily in the film.Also Mason Verger's sister Margot was a major character in the Novel and she was completely left out.I thought that the ending was badly altered, the ending in the novel was far more satisfying and made much more sense. If you have yet to read the novel,I would recommend it, it's a lot better.This film felt very rushed, I think it could have been better planned. Perhaps they where under pressure to get the movie made quickly.I believe it performed even better than The Silence of the Lambs at the box office but then it was bound to after the long wait and expectation.

552,elitshen,Pointless,6,18 November 2020,"In the silence of the lambs, we see Hannibal and agent Sterling meet each other and actually develop a relationship with one another. This movie essentially tries to build on that established relationship, although frankly it fails to do so, there is no actual character development, this movie feels more like a clarification of their relationship more than anything. We see Sterling in trouble and Hannibal comes to rescue her, a simple plot with some subplots that are frankly much more interesting than the main plot itself. As we already know that Hannibal is attracted to agent Sterling to a feverish degree in SOTL this movie holds no actual plot significance.The movie does contain many cool scenes that truly showcases Hannibal's ingenuity and creativity. I think that this by itself makes the movie interesting. If you just let yourself go and not nitpick on the plot. this movie makes for a great watch.I think the main qualm that people have over this movie is how different Hannibal works as a plot point as compared to SOTL, in SOTL Sterling consulted him when lost, he was a shepherd, he was a god, one that was sure to give her guidance when she came to him. But in this movie, he acts on his own, kills people with his own hands, gods don't do this, his status has ironically been degraded by letting him out of prison, how do you become weaker as a character by getting out of prison, essentially being unleashed upon the world I do not know, but this is the truth, to a boogeyman sort of existence.Acting wise, Anthony Hopkins never fails to deliver, I would eat my heart out, heh no pun intended, to see him star in a reboot of Hannibal if someone decides to make it,.

The creepy,mysterious atmosphere from the novel doesn't appear one single time in the movie,when I saw it first in the cinema I even fell asleep.Why was Margot Verger, a very important character, totally omitted? Why was Barney shown as a dumb ignorant whose only ambition is to earn money? And most of all, why was the psychological process Starling went through in the end,caused by the drugs Lecter applied to her,descended? Not to speak about the fact that the ending was omitted,too,and totally changed? Well, the reasons why Jodie Foster refused to play Starling again are well known and I accepted it,although like surely many others I'm very disappointed 'cause I identified Starling with her.For stories like Red Dragon,The silence of the lambs or Hannibal that possess such psychological depth, it is very important to identify with a character when they're adapted for the screen,but as the Germans say, that's ""snow of yesterday"". Ridley Scott did some incredibly good movies but with this one he doesn't live up to his name. Jonathan Demme had exactly the right feeling for the plot, the characters and their relationships towards each other in The silence of the lambs, he should have done Hannibal,too.My only comfort is that I've seen the movie only two times,it's long ago and thank god for that reason I'm able not to see the scenes from the movie when I read the novel. I'm so sorry but I really can't recommend it to anyone.",Hannibal
554,kavalhh,Not As Good As the Original,5,27 August 2001,"Ridley Scott is more suited to directing action movies rather than a horror-suspense thriller (a few action scenes in this movie already demonstrate his talent as an action director). This sequel to Silence of the Lambs is not as marvelous as the original except the ending where it's astonishingly superb. The middle part of the film has been dragged too long & paced too slow, resulting in less scenes of meeting & contact between Hannibal & Clarice. The best part of the show is none other than the interaction between the two but, sadly enough, their chemistry simply fails to spark (main reason is because Agent Starling wasn't played by Jodie Foster, whom we've already got used to her acting as the lead character of the film)! In a nutshell, this is still a worthwhile sequel despite the weaknesses of the film mentioned above.",Hannibal

556,bi0h4z4rd,Good one time showing,5,3 August 2003,"Here is the good and here is the bad, straight up.*POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD*
Good:1. This movie is strictly about hunting down Dr. Hannibal Lecter. None of that ""Help me find so and so killer Dr. Lecter.""2. It does have some Gory graphical scenes.3. The acting is pretty good.
Bad:1. They used Julianne Moore instead of Jody Foster for the part of FBI Agent Clarice Starling.2. In Silence of the Lambs, Clarice Starling (Jody Foster) was really ""good hearted."" She didn't seem so aggressive to killing people. In ""Hannibal"", she receives a congrats to being the #1 FBI Agent who kills the most people. Not really good thing.3. I didn't like how Hannibal had a soft side to Clarice. This guy is a serial killer who has no mercy on his victims. Yet he is so utterly in love with Clarice its ridiculous.Overall its good to watch for the first time. After that I wouldn't see it again.My Rating: 3.0/5.0",Hannibal
557,beautifulbooks,I laughed and really enjoyed most of this movie...,9,10 October 2003,"Well, I guess you can't please everybody. I would have to agree that I missed Jody Foster as Clarice but Ms. Moore did a better job than I expected. Personally, I laughed most loudly as I cringed near the end... multiple times. I don't think I will every look at Ray Liotta the same way again ;>Anthony Hopkins smiled when asked about these parts and said it was ""camp"" and that about all they could do to go beyond it would be pornography (paraphrased).

558,bridgesofsighs,A boring sequel,3,6 August 2017,"The first thing that stood out when I watched this movie is how boring it was. Halfway through the movie, I was checking how much time is left, and wishing that I was sleeping instead. None of the characters were interesting, and the plot was quite thin. The addition of the detective took away time that could have been used to develop Hannibal and Starling.I feel like the character of Hannibal is overrated and underdeveloped. The only things we know about him are that he is a cannibal (for no reason), he likes to kill rude people (for no reason), he's classy (more like pretentious in my opinion), and he can instantly psychoanalyze anyone by just looking at them. A character who knows things that should be impossible to know isn't smart, he's just good at guessing or is the author's pet. And sometimes he really is the smartest person in the room, because everyone else is so stupid. I've seen much better serial killer and genius characters in other movies.The brain-eating scene was one of the most disgusting things I've seen. It was also scientifically dubious. Apparently being a surgeon and an anesthesiologist are included in Hannibal's Gary Stu skills. Watching Starling wobble on high heels on morphine was painful to look at, and cemented my opinion that the Hannibal/Starling romance is disgusting.",Hannibal
559,greggt89,i really liked it!,9,7 February 2007,"When i found out that Hannibal Rising was being released, i decided to go back and watch the previous Lector films before it. All the other Lector films have the character in the background but with Hannibal the character finally gets his chance to shine.Anthony Hopkins returns as Hannibal Lector, a part he made famous in the previous film Silence Of The Lambs. After escaping he is living under a different name in Italy but when his name is put onto the F.B.I 10 most wanted list, Clarice Starling is put on the case to track him down.the acting in this film is brilliant all round. the cinematography is also good and the film is a very good insight of the way Lector likes to live his life.I'm looking forward to the return of Hannibal lector on Friday",Hannibal

The scenes shot in Florence are stunning, beautiful, and what else would we expect from Ridley Scott, the man knows how the dazzle us with scenery...Gladiator, Blade Runner.  What I found out on Sunday was that this movie was Extremely well directed, well acted by all, and had the plot and story line of a child's science fiction novel.  I thought seriously Harriet Potter might have written the treatment for this movie.  Hopkins, Moore (Clarice, since Jodie Foster is too opinionated) and Scott Really pull this movie out, and if they had only had a script to work with, this might have made movie of the year.  While it is not, it is still an entertaining movie none the less, with amazing cinematography(going through the woods), and the best acting I have personally seen in a while...Dark and dangerous this movie takes us to places we rarely see anymore, with such controversy over the ending, one almost has to go see it.

How it's horrible, disgusting, nothing like Silence of the Lambs.BINGO!This isn't a part two. There is no kidnapped woman for Starling to try to rescue. It's all about Hannibal, hence the title. Starling is only a supporting character in this movie, and I think Julianne Moore did an extraordinary job, considering the shoes she had to fill.
Yes, Hannibal is much slower-paced than most people would prefer. In this fast paced world, people want things now. They want to be told what the movie is about, not to have to figure it out on their own. Hannibal takes its time. You have to wait a bit to actually see the title character. This film requires patience. Shame on everyone out there who dares compare this to Silence. Silence of the Lambs is perhaps one of the best thriller/suspense movies out there. But for me, Hannibal is a guilty pleasure, and I enjoy it on a different level than Silence.",Hannibal

Hannibal the in-spite-of-his-nick-name-never-seen-eating-anyone Cannibal is back.Are we expected to root for Hannibal? All I wished for was that they would have thrown him to the pigs. I would have liked that. As it is, Hannibal is a sadistic b***ard who tortures and kills people. He is also depicted as possessing a superhuman intellect that makes him capable of manipulating any person into doing anything. Yeah, right. He is obviously also a first rate brain surgeon. All I can say is: Crap!If you want to see a movie with a psychotic killer done tastefully, watch ""Minus Man"" with Owen Wilson. That's a teriffic movie. This one stinks to high heaven! This is the worst kind of sadistic crap that made American Psycho a hit (well, the book anyway).",Hannibal
563,Spaceman-6,Boring,3,17 February 2001,"The original SOTL is one of my favorite movies ever and still gets me on the edge of the seat, and maybe it was because I had already the book (which is even more awful if that is possible) but it was boring, which is the worst thing for a  thriller to be.  The entire middle of the movie is taken up by a sub-plot in Italy that no one cares about -- we all know what is going to happen, there is no tension! The gore isn't even all that gory (the brain looks so fake).  Lector in SOTL is threatening, dangerous, but he is just a cartoon, cracking stupid jokes and waltzing around like an idiot.  Mason Verger is even worse, scenes that should be evil and tense, are comical.  In fact the whole plot is so outragous and retarded, that it seems clear to me, that like Thomas Harris, the film makers were only out for a quick buck, and i hope that the word of mouth will soon send this film to the dustbin of history, a minor footnote tot he great Silence of the Lambs.  Julianna Moore is really good though.  I guess it had that going for it.  And Anthony Hopkins does the best with with is given to him.  But that doesn't save the movie. 3/10",Hannibal

But yesterday I was literally blown away. I can't give you the details, you'll have to see for yourself.  The images from this film will stay in your mind forever.I thought it wasn't gonna be the same without Jodie Foster but the truth is, Anthony Hopkins was the center of the first movie, and still is in the sequel.  They could have paired him up with any other actress, wouldn't have made much difference for he is the magnet that pulls you in and keeps you mesmerized, motionless, breathless...I guess it's part of the human nature to be shocked, whether it's outrageous comedy (like Andrew Dice Clay; something that taps into deep, dark corners of the human soul), or the magic silver screen.  Images can be a lot more powerful and shocking than words.  They say words can't hurt you, you can hear something and take offense or laugh and forget about it.  But visual perception becomes imprinted in our memory and we live with it for the rest of out lives.Even after the final credits finished rolling my mind was still deep at the bottom of some dark abyss, held there by some supernatural force and I couldn't shake it off.  I wished I could put my head in the bucket of cold water and then scream at the top of my lungs until my voice fails me.  Never had a movie make me feel like this.  But aren't these the moments we all live for?I'm still not quite myself so you have to forgive me, I have to go outside and get a breath of fresh air, do inventory of the remainders of my sanity, if any, and check whether the top of my skull is still in place...

565,Karlover,A perfect complement to Silence of the Lambs,7,10 February 2001,"If you're going to see this movie, and I hope you do, I suggest that the night before you watch Silence of the Lambs. And if you're an even bigger fan, rent and watch Manhunter the night before that. Hannibal is an incredible ending (or is it?) to a fantastic series. While SotL introduced us to how manipulating Hannibal is, we dont see him in action so to speak. This is more than made up for in Hannibal. Finally we get to see just how he works and his motivation for those actions. Sir Anthony Hopkins better get serious Oscar consideration as Hannibal Lecter will undoubtedly go down as one of the greatest characters of all time. Julianne Moore was surprising brilliant in her portrayal of Clarise Starling. It took me a few minutes to adjust to her, but eventually I forgot who the first Clarise was. I cant say too much about the content, because the more surprised you are about the movie, the better. I give it a 9 of 10 only because it is impossible to beat the original Silence of the Lambs.",Hannibal
566,zahno,Pure Garbage,1,11 February 2001,"The fact that ""Hannibal"" has a Best Picture-winning predecessor only serves to make this unimaginative gore-fest look that much more pathetic when held up to the original.  Wooden acting, characters and situations, a disjointed plot that never gains any momentum, topped off with gratuitous, stomach-wrenching gore make ""Hannibal"" one of the most disappointing films to come around in some time.  Its hollow recreation of the cat-and-mouse banter of the first film (which benefited greatly from the chemistry between Hopkins and Jodie Foster) rings false, presenting the audience with no new wrinkles in their relationship.  Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling seems painfully aware that she has big shoes to fill after Jodie Foster wisely passed on the script.  She never seems comfortable in the role, while Anthony Hopkins, reprising his classic role, seems like a guy doing an extended imitation of Anthony Hopkins playing Hannibal Lecter.  I wish I could say something more positive about this film, given that I've really enjoyed the work of everyone involved previous to this film, but man, this movie sucked.What's unfortunate is that people might look at this film as a 'gory romp' or a 'bloody thrillride' while a film like, ""I Spit on Your Grave"" or ""Friday the 13th Part IV"" would be held in the lowest contempt by the same people.  For all intents and purposes, ""Hannibal"" is nothing more than a low-end slasher flick with a whiff of window-dressing intellectualism and higher production values.  Truly awful.",Hannibal

571,benjaminconvey,"Brilliant, Misunderstood, The Next Horror Classic!",9,23 February 2001,"I'll try to keep this brief and short.Firstly, this film is completely different from Silence Of The Lambs. No, that does not mean that it isn't as good. In fact it is hugely better. Silence Of The Lambs was a well made police procedural. It wasn't a horror movie. Hannibal is a horror movie, and it is excellently original and excellently well made. And there is absolutely no way that the 'blood and guts' in this movie (which have been, as is common with the media, completely sensationalised) detract from its respectability or quality.Hannibal is a brilliant movie, featuring perfection on every level. Acting, music, makeup, direction. Hopkins, Liotta, Moore and Gianni are all fantastic in their roles. Gary Oldman as Mason Verger (with a second billing to his fantastic makeup job) portrays the first truly abhorrent movie monster to be shown for quite some time. Hans Zimmer's beautiful, haunting music score really sets the gothic/macabre-romantice mood of this affecting movie. And Ridley Scott's direction is so visceral and immersive, not to mention unique, rich and original.Hannibal truly is a masterpiece of a film. I won't bother going into specifics, because the movie itself is better at showing you WHY its so good. All I can really say is just how enjoyable and fantastic this film is.Do not listen to anyone who says the following: ""It focuses more on the gore than suspense."" ""It was a case of style over substance."" ""There was too much humour in it."" ""Doesn't hold a canlde to Silence Of The Lambs.""Quite honestly I am tired of hearing those cliches. Sequels are a strange, misunderstood and mistreated beast. In the world of film criticism, sequels are considered, as a rule to be inferior products. Well that's a closed minded belief if I ever heard one. Also, sequels are always damned if they follow the same kind of plot and style of the first film, a la Scream 2. But what of a sequel, like Hannibal, which is completely and utterly different, goes down a completely different path and is all the better for it? It gets ripped to shreds by the media for not being the same as its predecessor!!! What a load of hypocrisy!Don't listen to critics. Which I guess means don't listen to me too. But as long as that means you watch Hannibal with an open mind, then I guess that's a good thing....",Hannibal
572,benjaminconvey,Masterly.,9,9 September 2001,"This is a beautifully shot, excellently scored, wonderfully acted, gorgeously staged film that is an absolute visceral pleasure to watch. It has all the hallmarks of a classic horror film, hallmarks which mainstream US critics (who love nothing better than a straight, bold-faced movie with no human humour) on one hand celebrate in the classics, and on the other hand despise in modern day movies.""The film is too gory and disgusting"", claim most SOTL-philes. The same thing was said about ""John Carpenter's The Thing"" back in the early 80s when film critics were salivating over Spielberg's warm fuzzy take on Aliens on Earth (critics have such short attention spans they can only handle one ideology at a time.)""The villain is comical and amiable"", cry the naysayers. Did nobody laugh at Frankenstein's monster's humorous bumblings in Bride of Frankenstein? The characters in this story actually make us laugh! What a terrible, terrible thing! Lord knows most people in everyday life never do anything funny.""The film is nothing like Silence of the Lambs"" is also a popular complaint. I thought sequels were usually despised because they apparently clone the formulae of their predecessors? That this film is so different to SOTL is a cause for celebration, not derision!Basically, this film is destined to become a classic. I feel sorry for the people who can't enjoy this film now because of simple, artificial, pretentious reasons. And those are the people that will be jumping on the bandwagon in years to come, appreciating Hannibal as the horror masterpiece it will be seen as in years to come.",Hannibal
573,dubbledown,Without a focus... (SPOILERS),6,7 January 2002,"Very well made and well acted film (what else would you expect with Ridley Scott, Anthony Hopkins et al) but lacked real suspense.  I know that sounds strange but I never had the feel that Dr. Lecter would ever meet his demise. Each twist and turn was very predictable and it seems the film tried to shock with its depiction of violence and gore instead of with its storyline. Overall a disappointing follow-up to one of the best films of the 90s. (6/10)",Hannibal

The mere fact that he can portray an utterly evil character in such a likeable way says it all.  As a movie, the director has been very successful in making the public feel so similar to what Clarice must feel towards Hannibal Lecter.  His impeccable manners as a gentleman, and his attentions to Clarice are a real winner for feeling somewhat of a respect for Hannibal.  And it makes it completely acceptable (and actually wanted) that he stays a free (yet wanted) man.Bravo.",Hannibal
575,crazycanuck2k88,Disappointment? Hardly!,10,20 February 2001,"Let me get this off my chest first, for people expecting Hannibal to be anything like it's predecessor u will be disappointed.  It's really nothing of the sort and the only recognizable similarity between the two is Hopkins' exceptional performance.  I read a lot of bashing of this movie so when I went in to see it today I was skeptical.  I thought to myself, is this movie going to be another one those cheap ripoff sequels that aren't even half of what the original was?  My skepticisms were thrown out the window however as this movie turned out to be a very suspensful and highly entertaining piece of film.To compare this movie to Silence is unjust for the fact that Hannibal tries not to be like it's predecessor.  It is very much unlike Silence, so u really cant compare the two.  When u go into see this movie, judge it alone without the comparison and I think u will see that this movie is very well done.  The acting is overall very superb.  Anthony Hopkins does no less than entrance the audience once again as the character of Hannibal seems to fit him like a glove.  Julianne Moore does a fairly good job playing Clarice Starling.  I have heard a lot of bad reviews about her role and I really cant see why.  She plays a different Starling then Foster did, since this movie is 10 years later, and pulls it off exceptionally.  The supporting cast also did a fine job especially Gary Oldman as Mason Verger, who plays a deliciously evil villain who sometimes deserves pity for what he is doing and what he went through.The plot in itself seemed to me to be fairly well written, and highly plausible, and to not give too much of the ending away, it does leave room for perhaps another sequel.  Speaking of the ending, I heard so much about the gruesome and gory scenes in this movie but when I walked out of the theatre I thought that they were not even half as bad as what most people were saying.  Perhaps it is the fact that I am maybe decensitized to violence, but this movie did not shock me, and I really dont think that is what it set out to do.  I think Ridley Scott set out make a film using his own brand/style of directing, and if some scenes called for a bit of blood and guts, so be it.To conclude, if u enjoyed Silence of the Lambs and are looking for a deserving sequel to live up to the Hannibal name, perhaps this is not ur type of movie.  I rated it a 10 because of it's originality and brilliance, and I applaud the filmmakers for bringing the very believable character of Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter back into our lives, and nightmares.",Hannibal
576,ToReignInHell,"Wasn't Silent, that's for sure...",6,10 February 2001,"This movie was definitely a movie worth seeing, especially if you're a fan of it's predecessor, Silence of the Lambs. However, although I did enjoy it, I had a fairly large problem with it.  It doesn't go anywhere.  The movie, while having content, manages to end up at the same place as it is in the beginning.  I was expecting another movie along the lines of Silence, and was disappointed on that count. Ridley Scott does a wonderful job directing this, and I was thoroughly impressed with the cinematography.  Some of the camera work is quite impressive, and Anthony Hopkins puts on another breath-taking performance as Hannibal Lecter. Julianne Moore does a good job as Sterling, although there are parts of the movie where they use dialogue from Silence, and it is readily recognizable there that her voice is definitely not Jodie Foster's.  But other than that, she fills the role in very nicely. All in all this was a very good movie, although again, it is much more about character development than it is any sort of plot.  So if you're planning on going to see it, expecting to see another Silence, make sure you adjust your expectations if you want to get the most out of this film.",Hannibal

I am not easily ""gored out"", but the directorseemed bent on trying to gross out the audience.

Moore's performance as Clarice is yet again not as good as Foster's, but gets progressively better throughout the movie. To discuss the end of the movie, I was angry with the outcome that was chosen above the one in Thomas Harris' novel.  Why couldn't Ridley Scott have let the best part of the novel shine through at the end?  The very end of the movie is uncharacteristic and atrocious, making Hannibal into a malicious monster instead of the introspective and classy one many of us hold dear.",Hannibal

That is probably the first thing everybody is thinking, when reading the title.But: There is a good explanation for that.***Minor spoilers ahead***1. Hannibal is no longer Hannibal. He is a totally changed character. And that is not, because he is free. This is bad acting, directing and writing.2. What happened to Clarice Starling? Is she brainwashed? When did it happen, that she forgot the feelings she had, while looking at the pictures of the bitten nurse?3. Worst directing in an A-movie. Why the hell must Ridley Scott (whom I admire for ""Blade Runner"" and ""Alien"") show the scene where Hannibal bites the nurse? It is in comparison much, much worse than the scene in ""Silence of the lambs"". Or the brain opening sequence... What was that for? You would not have to show it. Just for the effect. More is more. Wrong answer Mr. Scott. Take a close look at ""Red Dragon"". Brett Ratner did a brilliant job. His movie follows the high art of direction, which Jonathan Demme did in ""Silence"", what makes ""Red Dragon"" an ingenious prequel. Not as good as ""Silence"". But close behind.4. Stupid script: The whole revenge-plot is crap. And the worst they (Whoever. I blame them all.) did, was creating a hero out of Lecter. Do you remember the line: ""He only kills people for revenge."", which Starling tells some coworker in order to defend(!) Lecter. (Excuse me, if it is not the correct English line, I only saw the movie in German) He is a killer for gods sake. Yes, he is charming, educated, intelligent, well dressed, polite, but a serial killer.There are so many other things I could cite, but I dislike ""Hannibal"" so much as I adore ""The silence of the lambs"".Of course I know that there are worse films than ""Hannibal"" but for an A-movie and the pretension, it gives to itself, I rate this 1/10 for being boring, stupid and worst made of all A-movies of all time.

584,roybrady,It Grows On You,8,30 October 2002,"Warning: SPOILERS!Hannibal is a movie that definitely makes itself a better view every time you sit down and watch it. I first watched it as an immediate follow-up to Silence of the Lambs (I had just seen Red Dragon, in which Ralph Fiennes does an amazing job, watch him in Schindler's List, a good job there, too, and felt it necessary to watch the other two films). This was a major mistake. At first, Silence of the Lambs felt greatly superior to its sequels, and while it is the superior mystery, it should be known that Hannibal does not attempt to follow in the same vein as Red Dragon or Silence of the Lambs. These two films portrayed our dear cannibal as a supporting character, in Hannibal, Dr. Lecter is THE main character. In it, we begin to understand and learn aspects of this character that were not explained in Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs. We begin to see Hannibal not only as some insane genius behind the glass but as a human with very inhuman potentials, something that we are all possible of, I might add. The best parts come in the negation of the violent rabid doctor images in which a lunging madman comes with gaping jaws, mawing at one's throat or tongue. He kills with an artistic capacity. One event, he hangs a man from the very windows that an ancestor of the victim was hanged also, but adds his own touch, disemboweling the victim to mirror an engraving of the hanging of Judas Iscariot with his bowels spilling from his body. Anthony Hopkins frighteningly portrays this all with great accuracy, but it also comes with his experiences as playing as very intelligent or diligent men (Note: Lieutenant Bligh in Bounty, the movie version of Mutiny on the Bounty). Many people think Anthony Hopkins' performance is overrated, on the contrary I think he does a marvelous job that few others, if any, could ever imitate. He's a masterful artist at what he does. The only qualm I have with his character is his use of ""Okey-dokey"", it sounds too plain for a character that is supposed to be that intelligent. Now, enough of Lecter and Hopkins.The story seems shallow in its origins. In fact, the entire renewal of the hunt for Lecter stems from the vendetta of a political string-pulling aristocrat who is played by Gary Oldman, a performane that if it were not in the credits and some of the flashbacks would render him unrecognizable, though I've never been a fan of the heavy Southern accents plaguing the Hannibal movies even though I live in Alabama, where I imagine I should be desensitized to it. The events that do occur because of this root, though, makes everything more interesting. Because he has to hide now again from international authorities, having been reinstated to the FBI's Top Ten Most Wanted list during the movie's course, he now has to take the drastic actions that prove to be stomach-churning for the faint of heart. And for the gore-maniacs out there, this movie is definitely for you, the scenes of Lecter at work are quite enjoyable. Everyone I'm sure has heard of the famous scene featuring the dinner with Krendler (Ray Liotta) and Clarice (Julianne Moore) near the end of the movie.The last major point I care to make note of: Julianne Moore. At first, her performance doesn't seem as powerful as Jodie Foster's original Clarice, and this is come from the bias of having seen the first movie and developing a sense of being used to a certain actor portray a character. It would betray film-goers if Anthony Perkins didn't reprise his role in the Psycho sequels as Norman Bates, would it not? She does hold her own though and gives a good strong performace, unfortunately, it does upset the character balance. As a strong combative Clarice, she lacks the frailty and vulnerability that Lecter forced upon her. In the first film, she was clearly very intimidated. In this one she was not. Of course, the fact that the movie takes place ten years down the line, with ten years of FBI experience for our Agent Starling, doesn't help this comparison either.  The only real way to know would be to watch two Hannibals, one with Jodie Foster and the other as is, or two Silence of the Lambs's, one as is and the other with Julianne Moore. Who knows? Maybe Julianne Moore is the better Clarice? I'm not at judgment to say because both actresses did jobs well done. Rounding off: The most of the cast does a good job. Ray Liotta definitely makes himself a hateable Washington Justice Department slimeball, who gets what he deserves. Anthony Hopkins, I believe, is not overrated. Julianne Moore does not disappoint. And Gary Oldman, as always, delivers a fine performance. The movie will definitely find itself more appealing to those interested in movies that show the killer at work, but also to those of interest in the Hannibal character, now what we need is a movie explaining why he chose cannibalism and murder. At first, I gave the movie a 7 of 10, seemingly a bit high amidst my initial disappointment (remember my fatal error, watching it back-to-back with Silence of the Lambs), but went back and eventually raised the score a notch to 8 of 10. Best suited for Hannibal fans and gore-lovers or anyone with morbid yet open minds willing explore those dark little thoughts in the back of your head.After all, we're all geniuses, aren't we? Hmph!",Hannibal

Anthony Hopkins returns as Hannibal Lector who as seen in the ending of the original, escape and was about to have an Old friend for lunch. This movie picks up ten years after the events, and finds the old doctor Living quite conformable in Rome. But all that is about to change when a vengeful Ex victim wants to make Lector pay for all that was done to him. Add to the mix is Clarice Starling (Who is played here by the always excellent Julianne Moore.)  Who was about to lose her job because of a drug bust gone bad, int'l the F.B.I makes her an offer to reopen the Lector case, and clean her good name.  While this was no where near as good as Silence of The Lambs, it's a good follow up because it does go more into the relationship between the good Doctor and Clarice and offers a more in depth connection between the two. The movie is also a visually stunning movie that hits you in so many levels, especially the scenes in Rome where a good portion of the film takes place. Anthony Hopkins gives another scary performance, and yet gives a sense of romantic flare to his character. It's his performance that single handedly makes this film a worthy sequel to the original.

While most of this film is based on suspense, there is certainly plenty of gruesome horror by the end. Anthony Hopkins revisits his infamous role of Hannibal Lector in this disturbing sequel to Silence of the Lambs. Julianne Moore revises Jody Foster's character of Clarice Starling. There are also several other new friends to mEAT in this terrifying chapter of the Hannibal Lector tale. Mason Verger (Gary Oldman) is out for revenge for the torture that Dr. Lector put him through many years ago, leaving him grotesquely disfigured. He may have found him with the help of the Italian detective Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannni). Meanwhile, Clarice is also searching for Hannibal after being embarrassed by the FBI for a botched mission. Who will get to him first? Or is it possibly Hannibal who truly has the upper hand? You'll have to watch to find out. Brilliantly directed by Ridley Scott and excellent editing by Pietro Scalia, this film is truly terrifying in the most fun way. The story is engaging, as it is disturbing.

Only this time a lot bloodier and really trying to go over the top with eating habits of Lecter, and his biting habits. He is an old man, even in ""Silence of the Lambs"", when compared to younger, stronger well trained men. If he was well trained and didn't have Anthony Hopkins body, well, then maybe, maybe, not for sure. Well, he is known for this and that and yet he is still secured minimally, joke and doesn't happen. But Demme and Tally, the director and writer of silence of the lambs didn't do this movie because it was over the top. Anything over the top (because you look at that and not the art) and you will see the names Ridley and De Laurentiis along side. In one scene Lecter (Hopkins) overpowers Krendler (Liotta). I don't care what type of man Krendler was, do you see the difference between the two me? Watch that scene and tell me that old man Hopkins, even if he is Lecter, can, and that easily mind you, hold a hanky on Liotta's face, no way.
They make Lecter to be a superhero. This movie, and most of their movies, is so far from reality it insults your intelligence.
I don't know what men you people grew up with, but the older guys I saw in my neighborhood and what they did at times, well, let's just say they would have to save Lecter from them. Boy oh boy, men have become sniveling, scared little people. And I don't mean fighting evil, but standing up for what you believe in and then others should do the same no matter who they are.
Here is a movie with no focus and is a shock movie and one man (A psychopath) and a woman (Starling) are the only ones that can do anything worth while, in this movie.

Hopkins is gorgeous, the master of understated camp, Giancarlo Gianno compelling, and Gary Oldman should get a medal for that almost anonymous performance. Cinematography takes the breath away, so the whole survives its weakening plot line. There's another hook at the end for a second sequel, and there should be one, but let's have David Cronenberg or Atom Agoyan take over, and restructure the main conflict.

594,MovieChi,"Hannibal, a hearty helping of horror and hilarity",9,12 February 2001,"Silence of the Lambs was undoubtedly a film for the ages and a cinematic masterpiece.  How could director Ridley Scott and Anthony Hopkins create a better sequel? They couldn't.  But they are pretty darn close.Hannibal Lector is Anthony Hopkins at his best.  He has not lost the knack for portraying the only cannibalistic serial killer in history to win an Oscar. One may say that Jodie Foster was lost however.  Then I would add ""they gained JulieAnn Moore.""  She was very believable and did a great job filling Jodie Foster's role as Clarice Starling. I loved Ray Liotta as Paul Krendler.  He was perfect to play a 'ratfink' such as Krendler.  And although you never saw his real face, the makeup on Gary Oldman to portray Mason Verger was one of the most disturbing parts of the film.  The acting of the film deserves an A+, undoubtedly.Note: There may be some spoilers here so proceed with caution if you haven't seen the film. At first I was a little disappointed after the movie- it was different than the first one...a lot.  I didn't want this sequel to ruin the image of the original, as many sequels do. I wanted to like it - I relly did. As time progressed, I thought the movie wasn't that bad- in fact not bad at all (this took all of 30 minutes or so).  We still got some freakishly freaky chills. We got a good filling of home-fried human organs. The plot, though much different than the first, grabbed my attention the whole time- no question about the entertainment. Yet some parts were funny.  I can't think of anything funnier than Hopkins saying ""OkeeDokee"" before he kills people. I think that humor though just goes along with my appreciation of all three Thomas Harris novels with Lector and the first film.My favorite part - without a question- was when Lector trapped Starling by her hair in the fridge. He went in like he was going to eat her but added ""That's my girl."" Classic.  Classic, classic, classic.
This next thought may be downright sick for a 16 year old to say publicly but I got a kick out of Krendler eating his own brain.  I was laughing (to myself) at the kid on the plane (""It's good to try new things""). I realize now how much I did enjoy the film.If you walk into the theatre expecting a movie superior to the original, you may be disappointed.  If you walk in not expecting anything, I guarantee you'll love this film. I didn't like the ending of the Hannibal book but I really liked that of the movie.  Kudos to Ridley Scott.  I sincerely hope they make a movie based on the first book, ""Red Dragon""- a movie with Anthony Hopkins. Though he's a little older, at this point, no one else can play him.  It's like getting someone else to play Indiana Jones- it's just not cool.So, I recommend this movie to anyone.  It's much better than those teeny-bopper horror films starring Joe Blow from Dawson's Creek or whatever. This is a movie.  A movie that has 'dogs and cats living together'- dogs being humor, cats being horror.  Go do yourself a favor: get a nice bottle of Chianti and see it.  Dinner's ready; come and get it.",Hannibal

The most graphic movie I have ever seen, the only real flaws are the changes from the novel that were made.  The biggest is the absence of Jodi Foster.  Julianne Moore does a fine job as Starling, but true fans will miss Foster's performance.  Hopkins is flawless as the deranged MD, only adding to the nightmare factor of the character.  The hidden performance by Gary Oldman (uncredited) as the Mason Verger, the only surviving member of Hannibal's victims, will leave you breathless from the first scene on.

I was so Happy to finally sit in the movie theater to see this movie which i taught would be a masterpiece... but maybe i expected too much from This movie and like all sequels it's rare that it's as good as thefirst one but... oh well.. to sum it up in one phrase !!!

598,ktownpirate01,Hopkins was great but...,5,9 February 2001,"Let's face it, sequels are never as good as their predecessors. This film is no exception. Hopkins of course delivers his all, but this film is more a palette for Ridley Scott's ego than a movie about characters. Scott put together an artisticly beautiful film, but it's missing one thing; story. One of the best aspects of ""Silence of the Lambs"" was that the characters were all dynamic, but Scott sacrifices that in this film for great film and sound editing and beautiful scenic shots of Italy. EVERY character in Hannibal is static. Even Oldman is hard-pressed to make Verger scary or even loathsome, a skill with which he is normally a virtuoso. If you decide to see this film, keep in mind that it's not about Clarice Starling or Hannibal Lecter, it's about Ridley Scott showing off his skills as a film maker. On the plus side, Scott is good enough to at least make you squirm once in a while, though not because he scares you, but because he grosses you out.",Hannibal

Julianne Moore is an excellent actress and in my eyes she truly outshines jodie foster in the role of Clarice Starling.  While watching Hannibal I kept trying to picture Jodie Foster in the movie and I could not.  She could do what Julianne Moore did with the movie which I think is nothing short of excellence.  Anthony Hopkins was just as creepy as ever and this performance was better that his in Silence of the Lambs just because he was out of jail and could have more fun with the role, which I believe he did.

I still regret that I spent my money at the cinema for this below average film. It simply has nothing of the prequel´s appeal. Lecter being some kind of well educated ""gentleman"" killer who loves art, books and music in ""Silence of the lambs"" has nothing left of this ""elegance"" in ""Hannibal"". The very special atmosphere from the first part which was mainly created by NOT showing too many scenes of violence is totally destroyed in this movie. Not only are the bloody actions of Hannibal Lecter shown en détail but they also seem mostly ""unnecessary"" and not quite fitting (when you´ve seen ""Silence of the lambs""). The ""Ray Liotta""-scene from the end was completely ""out of bounds"" and quite ridiculous. Moreover the producers might have thought that there would be no need of a sensible storyline if they had Anthony Hopkins playing. Let´s hope there is no third film in development.",Hannibal
602,Jason-239,Less would have been Moore.,7,23 February 2001,"Telling a good story, either book or script, needs to be victorious in two wars: one, it needs to take the reader or viewer away from his familiar surroundings and not have him flee, and two, in this strange and wondrous universe, without missing a beat it needs to lead him back to his very own soul. To have an event driven genre meet these requirements is incredibly hard, but two of the most famous of these battles already waged in the Hannibal universe succeeded in this gloriously and at the same time form this film's main enemies. One is the film Silence of the Lambs, through the fantastic performances of both Foster and Hopkins that are led through its universe by the hand of scriptwriter Ted Tally and the eerie directing skill of Jonathan Demme, that effortlessly returns as the conqueror in both wars. The second is the book that the film Hannibal is based on. I remember starting in the bathroom sometime in the afternoon and reading it cover to cover, skipping every meal until sunrise was nigh. An amazing tour de force that had me diving deep into the darkest ponds of the soul and sympathizing with one of the most ruthless killers ever invented while wondering more about the writer than the characters. It is not easy to join these ranks. In my opinion this film came close, but no cigar. The creative powerhouses in this movie all claim that one should judge it on its own merits, but during the movie, one can't help but noticing it still relies heavily on the memory of the viewer regarding its prequel. True, Scott, Zaillian and Mamet have made a serious attempt to capture Hannibal's playground adequately, true, Hopkins delivers memorable moments, true, Moore is a more than worthy successor to Foster, but frankly I think they haven't tried hard enough to win the war. In my opinion the Hannibal universe is equally character driven as it is event driven, but sadly, focus was put on the latter.  The script allows for generous leaps in the storyline and suffers from loss of the threathening peace and tranquility that made the book and its prequel so enormously good; the musical score is way towards orchestral overkill (they should have stuck with Howard Shore, instead of the incredible amount of people this uneven score took); and oddly enough, there is just, well, too much Hannibal and too little Mason Verger (who in the book after making Martini's out of childrens' tears after he psychologically tortures them immediately ranked among my top list of seriously evil characters). I would have liked it more if the focus of the movie was kept on Starling and if Verger was fleshed out some more. The 40 odd minutes of Hannibal in Silence were of incomparable quality; now, I found only about 60% of his screentime to be actually memorable. I would have liked smaller but more powerful dosages. This time the film was more of a Hopkins vehicle and that simply does not enough credit to the rest of the story. In its favor I should point out that I liked it for Moore's performance, Scott's dark directing skills and its clinical use of extreme violence that Scott has written the book on (although I would very much have liked to see how David Fincher of Seven, The Game and Fight Club, would have handled this one), Oldman as Verger who turned in yet another good show and sadly got way too little screentime, the pigs were there (not credited in Snatch) and oh, for readers of the book, also the dinner scene at the end, that I have to admit was actually one of the sickest things I have ever seen.

However, even though all of the hype around Jodi not being in the movie, and the fact that the ending was going to be changed from the book, I was still eagerly anticipating seeing Hannibal in action again. First let me say that the theater in which I saw the movie had the sequencing all wrong--so we got to see reel 3 and then reel 2. (the people in the theater, whom had not read the book, were very confused, escpecially since the 3rd reel begins at a very 'murderous' scene, and no idea what led up to it.) Also, the sound quality of the final reel was terrible...Still I was hopeful. First, Julianne did an admirable job, but she is not Clarice in any way shape or form. Granted, Clarice has definately taken a change from SOTL, but I am sorry. She could not begin to fill the roll with the same intensity that Jodi did. The chemistry between Lecter and Starling was laughable in this film. A lot of key moments in the book had also been changed. The relationship between Mason and his sister left a hole that was terribly missed. The explanation of why Mason was in the condition he was in, was confusing at best. The director (or writer) never made the point totally clear that Mason was even more contemptuous than Lecter could ever be. This was a huge mistake!! On to the ending....It was, technically, horrible. In at least 5 or 6 shots, you could see the boom mike dipping down and moving around in the shot!! It totally destroyed what was to be a critical point...it distracted you from the actors and what was occurring on the screen!  Now, to the ending itself-I couldn't have been more disappointed. It made no sense-and left you feeling totally incomplete. The ending in the book was far fetched but a lot more beleivable than the tripe we were expected to swallow. You could see a lame attempt of the ""powers that be"" trying to keep the possibility of a sequel alive. The ONLY saving grace of the movie was Anthony Hopkins.

There were several blown opportunities at real scares and the climax that everyone oohs and ahhs over struck me as kinda silly and another missed opportunity to be a real screamer.   I suppose it had to be toned down for the movie's budget sake, so as not to get an NC-17. It's not a terrible movie, however it's nothing spectacular. George Romero...those of you that know movies think about him and ask yourself, compared to George Romero, Ridley Scott is not even doing anything in the horror or gore arena that is startilingly new.   In fact, the only thing new was Hollywoods willingness to spend big, fat dollars on the genre. Only because it was a proven vehicle and not without hedging their bets with MASSIVE advertising. You wanna see Anthony Hopkins in a truly awesome performance, in a truly twisted movie with depravity and horror about as well as infinitly more shock value than this.....try TITUS directed by Julie Taymor.

Ridley Scott is one of my favorite directors, but not even he can save this utter turkey of a film. This last time I was this bored was watching Arnie's The Sixth Day.  The only reason Hannibal didn't get turned off half way through was because I'd heard it was sick and twisted (which, incidently,it isn't)and wanted to see what the fuss was about.

To conclude i think overall it was an awesome movie just lacking that extra bit of bite that silence had.",Hannibal
613,kevo101,"Okey-Dokey, now lets see...good or terrible?",6,9 March 2001,"First things first- without Anthony Hopkins this movie would be nothing! His real life characteristics intruding at times into the Hannibal Lector character (which was a good thing). I was disapointed that Jodie Foster did not want to do this movie, but Jullianne Moore added a different spin to the character, giving it much needed separation from Silence of the Lambs. I thought the Empire review of this movie was a little harsh at two stars, cursing it with comparisons of its predesessor. In its own way, this is a good movie. It suffers from a little bit of 'Blair Witch Syndrome' in that if you listen to all of the hype you may be disapointed. Keep in mind also that this is a very different movie to Silence of the Lambs. The movie itself offers many beautiful locations, good direction and excellent performances from Oldman and Moore. My only gripe with the movie was that in terms of plot, the struggle between Thomas Harris (writer of the novel) and the movie producers is visible at times. The film gets off to a great start, slow build up and plenty of action (typical Ridley Scott stuff), but after that it is very stop-startish. It never flows or maintains any momentum.In conclusion I'd say this is a 'good' movie but not a great one. Worth a watch if you like blood and 'guts'.",Hannibal
614,Flavia89,Great psychological movie,8,27 December 2006,"Ridley Scott's screening is obviously a great movie. Hannibal Lecter is a legendary character. I was fascinated about the relationship between Dr. Lecter and Agent Starling. It's strange how a killer, who eats his victims with such a serene face can have this attraction to Starling. Clarice Starling has a dilemma: on one hand she is the incorruptible FBI agent, who wants her job back - which means capturing Hannibal, and on the other hand she absolutely worships Dr. Lecter's intelligence: 'Tell me, Clarice, would you ever tell me ""Stop"" ? If you loved me.... ""stop"" ?' 'Not in a thousand years' Professional killers like Hannibal Lecter shall never be in FBI's hands, and Clarice Starling shall always love H.L. I would really enjoy a ""Silence of the Lambs 3"", of course with Anthony Hopkins starring Hannibal Lecter.",Hannibal

616,george-838,The finest super hero movie of all.,10,17 February 2007,"I would like to draw a parallel here. I bought this film in the USA many years ago on a business trip. Watched it for the first time with jet lag at 2am in the morning in my hotel room. I've watched it more than a dozen times again since and it has become probably my most watch DVD in my 200+ collection since then. Every time I see it I see something else, it has so much depth that so many other ""good films"" strive to plunge too and so often fall short. It's a love story first and foremost. We have a monster who only dines on ""the free range rude"". Those who will pursue their own interests with no regard for anyone but themselves. That he's sick by human standards there is no doubt, but like a vigilante he plucks from society those that would harm people who he loves, or his own, lives. Like in any good super hero vigilante movie there is a dame in distress. This dame is special as she too is a ""fighter for justice"". The music is beautifully atmospheric, the locations and sets stunning as Florence should be. Everything in the screen exudes sophistication, like our ""super hero"". His ""special powers"" being his intellect, his love of the fine things in life, his ability to dissect the human brain not just physically but psychologically especially. At the end of the movie he confronts his love who has one goal and that is to re-imprison the man who loves her. That she has feelings for him too is shown with beautiful subtlety in this film. In a scene with her at home having a hard drink we see a tear in her left eye as she thinks of him listen to his tapes, this is repeated in another scene, the faint tear in the left eye. Finally she cries that tear in the end scene when she apparently succeeds in cuffing him to her when he's kissing her for the 1st time. In one of the greatest acts of love ever seen on the big screen that bring a love story and a horror story together to stunningly he cuts off his own hand rather than hurt or mark the woman he loves - even though he is a cannibal and a monster. Julie Ann Moore is superb, as is Hopkins again. Moore & Ridley Scott have joined with Hopkins in taking this film far beyond it's Oscar winning prequel. I find it strange that this film lacked the attention of the previous, and I can only concluded that the superb performance of Hopkins and the new level of shocking horror were what the general mass appreciated, in this film the beauty and love shine above the horror. It has hope.",Hannibal
617,kegean,"A Typical, but Entertaining Ridley Scott",8,1 August 2002,"This Film was nothing special, nor was I expeting it to be, as Ridley Scotts films are just little masterpieces in their own way.The Book was fair and I think the Religious connections worked alright too- The Betrayal of Hannibal(Jesus), by inspecter pazzi(Judas) and especially the part where Lecter was mounted on the forklift, being lead to the slaughter by Masons(Gary Oldman) wild boars.The performences were great and there's nothing that bad in it worth mentioning.-A good Romance -8/10",Hannibal

I had high hopes for Hannibal, some of which fell short, others of which were exceeded.Hannibal starts off slow: You're mostly presented with a bit ""filling in the details"" as to what happened between SotL and this film. If you haven't seen the first movie, I'm sure it's easy to get lost. But once the real hunt gets underway, the film picks up to a frantic pace. Without giving too much away, I must say that I was honestly a bit surprised by the ending - It really makes Dr. Hannibal Lector a mesmerizing and imposing figure.

620,yandri,Hannibal is almost like James Bond,2,9 June 2020,"Ridiculous and stupid!
Hannibal Lecter is a medical doctor. He's old, fat, slow, and obviously doesn't possess any military and combat skills. But somehow he able to easily travel and fly anywhere in the world despite having listed in the FBI's 10-most-wanted list alongside Osama bin Laden. His skills in this movie probably on par with Jason Bourne and James Bond. He able to swipe and kill someone with a swift move on the street without anyone noticing. He able to sneak in and out any house/office better than the whole crew of Ocean's 11.
Clarice Sterling in this movie is also annoying and stupid. That's right. She is S.T.U.P.I.D. She helped saving Lecter and even kill some of his enemies. She is the protector of cannibals. She is an accomplice to a mass murderer. She is the complete opposite of the cunning detective portrayed in The Silence of The Lambs.",Hannibal

Take a perfectly good psychological thriller franchise and run it into the ground dug out by the over-the-counter sensationalized shock-horror motion pictures, and you have Hannibal. This movie uses the same subplots and horrific visuals that Silence of the Lambs used masterfully to convey suspense and horror and instead achieves only cheap gasps and smirks. Startling characters with over-done makeup, dungeon lighting in benign environments, and extravagant mansions and other unbelievable settings place this movie far out of the reach of Silence of the Lambs, a movie that planted a seed of fear in the minds of every viewer and allowed that seed to root and flourish with masterful storytelling, character development, acting and proper use of visuals. The tangible idea of a ""serial killer next door"" from Silence of the Lambs is completely washed out in Hannibal. If you watch this movie and want to enjoy it, don't compare it to Silence; don't expect a plot that lingers in the depths of your own fears, merely watch it with your brain removed and placed on the seat beside you (spoiler not intended).",Hannibal

I don't shy away from violence, and I'll say it for the record that HANNIBAL is actually less graphic than people have made it out to be.  But the depths of stupidity and complete waste of cast and director is unforgivable.  Why Anthony Hopkins would ever choose to do this film is beyond me.

624,benjamin1walker,Like an unfinished script for a 3 month TV series,6,29 October 2004,"This film was poor by Ridley Scott's standards. In essence, this is a dumbed-down script adapted from a strange book that, on screen gives the audience an impression that a fantastic director has been rushed in to direct a film adapted from a book that has been based on a script written to encourage young people to make films. It's a sloppy screenplay, the film looks like it's been cut together from a 5-10 hour movie to fill approximately 2 hours of screen-time. It also looks like Scott has had to cut down scenes dramatically to give the film a sharper, more audience friendly look (like Gladiator- also directed by Scott). However, where Gladiator suited Scott's talents, Hannibal does not. Scott is better at visuals than he is at directing actors, Hopkins looks bored this time round, as does Oldman (barely noticeable after his make-up), as does Liotta - in a very Liotta role, and Moore is not really given any opportunity to act, she just merely looks dull, upset, and acts like a betrayed tough FBI agent as the screenplay prompts her to. The violence that appears randomly in this film gives the audience the impression that the film-makers want the audience to feel like they are watching violence in a manga cartoon rather than a film, it's pointless to take this film seriously.",Hannibal

629,sarrica,Mixed bag,6,9 February 2001,"I guess I shouldn't be surprised that you get a pulpy movie from a pulpy book.Hopkins was quite good, as usual, but his performance edged towards camp and self-parody.  Moore was fine as Starling but will forever be haunted by Jodi's prior take on the part.  Liotta was completely unlikeable --meaning he played the part perfectly, but that doesn't mean I have to like him. Gary Oldman was excellent, but I feel he was hampered by the make-up.  A thinner appliance would have been preferable to what he had to wear. Gianini wasn't given much to work with as Pazzi.The infamous dinner scene played better in the book, but probably would have been too much for both audiences and the MPAA.  How the MPAA signed off on what is presented baffles me.  What follows the dinner scene to close out the film is a huge disappointment.  The ending of the book that lots of people found objectionable is precisely the one that should have been shot. The revised ending is most unsatisfying.""Silence of the Lambs"" and the oft-overlooked ""Manhunter"" are better films, but ""Hannibal"" is worth seeing.  I just don't feel it rose above the source material the way the first two films did.",Hannibal
630,craigbe,"A fine sequel, very respectful of the original and the book",8,6 February 2001,"There are a lot of possible angles to discuss here: the faithfulness to the book, except the very absolute ending and the lack of one character; the faithfulness to the original characters, story, structure, and tone, even with a new Clarice Starling and a new director, Gladiator's Ridley Scott; perhaps how the film stands on its own. I just saw it a few hours ago, and my head's still spinning with how to (ahem - no pun intended) digest it all.
I guess I'll start with the basics: Julianne Moore holds her own versus Jodie Foster as Clarice, but she gets much less screentime than Foster did in the original - this is Hannibal's story. Giancarlo Giannini is terrific as the Italian cop who struggles between greed and justice, and makes the predictably unwise move to take Lecter one on one. Gary Oldman is unrecognizable as Mason Verger, Lecter's only surviving victim, and seeks sadistic revenge. Unfortunately the makeup does start to look like a mask over time - his eyes are impressive however. And Tony Hopkins? Well, he's clearly having fun here, and writers David Mamet and Steven Zaillian have worked hard to give him all the good lines, while trying to stay within the boundaries of Thomas Harris' book and the original film. Obviously, this is Anthony Hopkins' career defining role, and he slips back into it easily.
While the film is a bit long at 133 minutes, it manages to maintain a good deal of suspense throughout. The gore stays offscreen for most of the film, but when it strikes, it appears in disturbing flashy bursts, mostly saving us from the brutality, until the end. And all I'll say about it is that you've never seen anything like the dinner scene with Lecter, Starling, and her slimy boss, Krendler, played by Ray Liotta.When did Ridley Scott become a genius, and brother Tony Scott become a hack? Gone are the trademark full face shots from Jonathan Demme, replaced by a lot of the epic grandeur that we saw in Gladiator, especially the scenes in Italy. In fact, many of the fast paced scenes, such as the introductory drug bust were shot in the same gritty style as Gladiator's battles and (of course) Saving Private Ryan.PS - I'm one of the many people who has been gushing over the fact that Steven Soderbergh released two great films in the same calendar year (Traffic and Erin Brockovich), but will all the same people grant as much praise to Ridley Scott by releasing Gladiator and Hannibal within 8 months of each other?",Hannibal
631,Parsons,Silence of the Lambs for simpletons,3,23 February 2001,"I saw Hannibal last night and I have to say it was the worst film I have seen in the cinema since I can remember. It is a travesty to the memory of Silence of the Lambs with under written characters, no subtlety, a skewed narrative which fails to efface moments of transition and a lot of down right silly moments. I wept for Lector and Starling. They have taken the characters and poohed on them from a grand height. Oh yeah and Ridely Scott was totally the wrong director to choose. Over produced and overly violent for the sake of it. The only saving graces were Anthony Hopkin who hams things up but is still watchable and Julianne more who struggles with a bad script but manages to maintain some integrity.Frankly it was doomed to failure from the start, with all parties involved seeing pound signs before their eyes before a good story.Another sequel to add to the 'Must miss' list.",Hannibal
632,dietrich-3,more and less than what you've heard (SPOILERS),9,25 February 2001,"Although it is understandable everyone has differing standards and expectations for a sequel to a truly great movie, still I am astounded at some of the reviews on this movie. Both professionals and everyday movie-goers.  I read the book, have seen and read Silence of the Lambs (SoTL), seen Manhunter.  I had read nearly every review out there on this movie before seeing this and it seemed that there were two different movies called ""Hannibal"" out in the theatres.  I wasn't sure what the extreme variation in opinions and reviews meant, this would either be the worst movie I've ever seen or possibly the best. It is neither the worst nor best movie ever made.  However it is more (better or more intense) in some ways, and less (worse or less intense) in other areas of expectation.  You have to know the background of the characters, need to know SoTL. Just don't go in expecting the style and the characters to be exactly the same after many years (in the story and in our reality).  They are not and shouldn't be the same given passing years and differing circumstances.  That said, I felt this was less horror and more thriller drama than many reviews would lead you to believe.  Read on for why I say that.There is far less blood and gore than what you have heard... that people might have puked at this movie I find laughable. Maybe having read the book version of Hannibal it toughened me up, I expected more disturbing material, more gore.  The rants on the 'over-the-top' nature of this movie and it should be NC-17 were just plain alarmist.  Anyone who has seen a horror movie made in the last 20 - 25 years (going back to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) should not have a problem in this area.  I can be squeamish and nightmare prone and I was able to watch all the scenes with only a bit of squinting to blur it now and then, more in fear (from the books detail and reviews) than how bad the visuals really were.  The brain eating dinner scene was as much laughable as it was frightening or sickening. (And I believe this was purposeful, a bit of camp).  It might shock a bit, but this is not THE most in amount nor in intensity of gore ever seen on the screen. Far less gore than Saving Private Ryan.   Just before going to the theatre to see Hannibal a sci-fi movie on television rated Y -14 was playing. It had giant alien bugs tearing futuristic soldiers apart that was similiar to the level of gore with the man-eating pigs in Hannibal.  Some people find the man-eating pig implausible, some extra information spent on that aspect might have helped. Verger's face was not as bad as I visualized it from reading the book, but looked plausible and still nasty.  They took the very disturbing NC-17 level material in the book and got it down to R material. Not all that is for the better, some at the expense of character development - Mason Verger needed fleshed out  (ha ha pun intended) in particular who was clearly evil in the book.One complaint was that certain gore scenes were unnecessary.  The tape of the attack on the nurse alluded to in SoTL being one of those.  It WAS needed and perfectly fit in the plot.  This is where Lecter's arm is broken for a comparative x-ray to the one Mason Verger supplies.  This showing how Lecter even tied up was so dangerous, his bite there will be what Starling thinks about when Lecter feigns a bite at the refrigerator scene later on. The disfiguring of Mason Verger flashback might have been skipped.  This doesn't detail the type of hypnotic drugs described in the book, but seeing Lecter mesmorize the drugged man into cutting off his face probably had some merit to the hypnotic power of the man (in reading the book this scene did about make me gag, it was blurry and dark for the most part in the movie). The disembowelment was perfectly in line with the historical event of Pazzi's ancestor and Pazzi was less than honorable in making sure the street thug bled to death.  You really didn't see that much in the disembowelment, a pile of guts splat. Itchy and Scratchy from the Simpson's has more graphic broad daylight detail shown in their cartoon mutilations.  The dinner scene, well he isn't called Hannibal the Cannibal for nothing.  What do people expect?  He is choosing the most appropriate punishment for Krendler. What does a brainless man need with his brain?  Might as well get a gourmet meal out of it, and he can avenge the honor of Clarice at the same time.
The interactions between Hopkins and Moore don't have quite the same effect that those between Hopkins and Foster did in SoTL.  It is less psychologically intense, more cat and mouse especially in the carousel scene. But was it supposed to be the same?  Probably not because this is a different movie with a different focus.  Clarice isn't a green FBI trainee but a time and experience hardened law enforcement officer. Hannibal is not behind glass or bars restricted to only ""quid pro quo"" fun.  He is definately in love-mode here, he teases and wants, he pursues Clarice so she can chase him.  She gives him some reason to be excited, to ""come out of retirement,"" to fully appreciate his freedom by truly risking it by going to her.  He desires to help her out of her quandry as he had helped her catch Buffalo Bill.  The same yet different from SoTL.  We can try to say the only reason Clarice risks her career to go save Lecter from Mason Verger's pigs is she is simply doing ""right"" regardless.  I think that makes it too black and white, it is right but she couldn't and wouldn't have Lecter killed also because she does care for him.  She is torn between her duty and right and feelings for the man.Right wins in a way when the handcuffs are put on at the refrigerator - ask yourself why didn't she take and use her gun? She didn't want to be put into a position of using it against him.  She isn't always happy doing the right thing.  Like shooting a drug dealing HIV positive woman carrying a baby when she has no other choice.  She would have felt guilty if Lecter had been imprisoned again, for him that is worse than death, she absolutely didn't want to kill him.  This is some deep stuff hidden in this - Clarice feeling bad for doing the right thing, finding that doing the right thing can cause you to be punished unjustly, that doing the right thing can in a way be a bad thing.  You are getting a bit more here then just good Clarice and evil Hannibal.  There is a treading of common ground, two people who ""have"" to kill.  How far removed is Clarice's killing in the line of duty or self-defense from Hannibal's killing in self-defense and killing the ""rude"" he feels the earth would be better off without?  The main difference, outside of legalities - Hannibal being a bizarre vigilante, is in how it effects you.  If Clarice keeps looking into the abyss (having to kill and having to be intimate with the mind of a killer) will she eventually see the abyss looking back? ... Hannibal doesn't fear the abyss but rather embraces it as his code of honor and morality.   At the end Hannibal tho' smitten with Clarice isn't looking to run away with her ala the book end.  He saw the phone line light and knew he had limited time to complete what he had started, he wanted her to do the right thing.  Hannibal actually respects and admires her ethics.  He wanted to give her a good-bye kiss then is going to run FROM her knowing she will continue the pursuit.  He wants her to pursue, and he to turn the tables again later.  Some quid pro quo, some cat and mouse, sequel time.  Hey, SoTL was left W-I-D-E open for a sequel as well.Straight up excellent performances from the cast given the material.  The drug bust was very detailed action and let us see the new Clarice as we should.  The hardened, experienced, unappreciated law enforcement officer that she bacame over the years. The scenes and filming in Italy, the Italian police officer Pazzi... just excellent.  This IS Hannibal's world and gives some thriller drama over horror aspects.  The scenes in the states between Clarice and Hannibal in the carousel, cat and mouse detective for Clarice. Her rescue of Hannibal more of an action scene than horror I'd say.  We get to see Hannibal as surgeon sewing up Clarice, we get 'the picture' of what Hannibal would like from her (eventually, he's patient) when she wakes up dressed for dinner in the low cut evening gown.  Ninety percent of this movie was thriller, action, drama and not slasher horror.
Overall the filming was excellent, the visuals were gore enough apparently to traumatize some but not much more than what was needed to convey the story.  Some holes in the plot mainly not giving us the clear picture of Verger's crimes and evil nature.  Read the book and you'd push him into the pig pit yourself.  The ending of this movie was just short of satisfying and we are led to believe Hannibal sacrificed his hand... yet, I bet we'll see a 2-handed Lecter in the sequel to this. I personally could have lived without the brain eating dinner scene and would have prefered more time with Clarice and Hannibal alone interacting.  Still this a movie about a cannibalistic killer, so something like that brain scene isn't out of place... maybe we need to feel less ""romantic"" about our favorite cannibal killer Hannibal. Still the brain dinner scene was a bit of a dive into campy B-grade territory.   The ending of SoTL versus Hannibal makes the difference in how these two movies are regarded I think. Despite some flaws this is a very good movie.  As far as sequels go I'd say it is close to excellent.Sorry so long-winded, but I didn't see this until the 3rd weekend out and had heard so much I thought was misleading about this movie.",Hannibal
633,cd_13579,Gross ... as in grossly underrated,8,3 March 2001,"It couldn't be more wrong to dis Hannibal on how much it departs from the style of Silence of the Lambs. SOL is an excellent movie, but is also more of a conventional suspense- and plot-driven thriller (hence the easier acceptance by - for lack of a better word - the masses). Ridley Scott's Hannibal, by contrast, is the quintessential PSYCHO thriller. If you get disgusted instead of engrossed and mesmerized watching Hannibal, it's simply because the movie is not MADE for you. To me, Hannibal makes a worthy inclusion in the list of such masterpieces as Stanley Kubrick's artsy and controversial works (""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""2001 A Space Odyssey"") and Ridley Scott's earlier groundbreaking work, ""Bladerunner"", all of which I enjoyed immensely. Quite simply put, it's all about the otherly world experience. In the case of Hannibal, it's about experiencing the bizarre, disturbing, and utterly fascinating world of Lecter's mind and, above all, his TASTE ... for a bit of the REAL bad guy's brain with caviar, and, of course, for Clarice.Hannibal may be in the same genre as SOL and, alas, same trilogy ... but it thrives at a completely different realm.I can perfectly live with it if you are repulsed by ""Hannibal"".

I was expecting a very good movie (especially after Silence of the Lambs), and was let down by the lack of psychological intensity that SOTL offered so well.  In fact, the best dialogs between Hannibal and Clarice are clips from SOTL that Clarice listens to on cassette tape in the first half of the movie.This movie seemed to be more about how realistically graphic it could be, and not about the story or the characters.  Without spoiling, the final scene (the very last two or three minutes) is particularly disturbing and totally unnecessary to the movie.  Sir Anthony Hopkins did a fine job reprising his role as Lecter; Moore was dull and shallow as Clarice - this was probably due to the writing, however, as she (Moore) has shined in other films.I gave Hannibal 5 out of 10 stars.  They could have done so much better with this movie...",Hannibal
636,Dane Anderson,Perfect,9,10 February 2001,"Stop thinking about the first one for 5 seconds, and you'll realize this film is as perfect as a sequel can get. It was beautifully shot and extremely well done.  From that standpoint it was far superior to its predecessor.  Hannibal was played perfectly of course, and Julianne Moore was Clarice Starling.. not Clarice Starling number 2.  You won't notice the difference unless you consistenly remind yourself and compare her to Jodie Foster the whole movie.  The story flowed much better than the first one, because the original had too many subplots that all tied in at the end at not well enough during the middle.  Hannibal has one continuous story, the search for Hannibal, the subplot being the multiple people finding him and their reasons.  They all tie in together though, and are all used to lead up to the ending.  Ahh the ending.  The dinner scene is one of the most creative scenes in recent memory.  Though extremely grotesque, it was perfect for the mood of the film and added a bit of dark humor to it.  It ends perfectly, leaving you with more to think about than the original. Ebert has lost his flare for reviewing, and I don't know what he bases anything on anymore.  He's entitled to his opinion, but he's respected and listened to by too many people that great films won't get the recognition they deserve anymore.  Don't listen to Ebert or any other bad review you may read.  You will enjoy this movie, even more so if you've never seen the original.  Not because its better, but because you won't find yourself comparing the two the whole time instead of enjoying the film. 9/10",Hannibal
637,Rachel88,Wow...but some people are wimps!,10,12 February 2001,"I saw Hannibal this past weekend and all I can say is WOW.  The movie was great, the dialogue was great, the make-up for Mason was great, the scenery for the opera was breathtaking.  I was disappointed that it didn't live up to the hype but no movie ever does.As for the gore....please.  I was expecting to be made sick.  I have to admit that Saving Private Ryan's battle scene made me sicker than any scene in this movie.  People who saw this before it opened either over-exaggerated or are a lot weaker stomached than most.  The end scene that everyone was waiting for was actually comical.All in all, I was very much entertained.  I went out the next day and bought the soundtrack.  Beautiful music!!!!  Absolutely beautiful.  The opera alone is worth the price of the CD.",Hannibal
638,D_Emery,Perfect Hannibal...,7,10 February 2001,"Anthony Hopkins has to be congratulated for this one- he didn't just bring us the same old 'Hannibal' again... he expounded on the character so many times over, you can't miss this, if you're a fan... well, you can't miss it unless you have a weak stomach or are squeamish- because regardless of what the media might say about the level of gore, it isn't the GORE that will get you- it's how it is presented. Make no mistake about it, Hannibal is a monster- even if one most of us love to watch on the big screen... but I wouldn't reccomend inviting him in for dinner. (or eating yours just before watching this movie!) Even so, if you think you can handle it- don't miss Hannibal! It's spectacular.",Hannibal
639,sediwell,A bad slasher movie given the tarnished gloss of a big budget,3,8 February 2001,"No wonder Jodie Foster wanted nothing to do with Hannibal. This is just a bad slasher movie given the tarnished gloss of a big budget, major actors and studio support. Unlike the superb Silence of the Lambs or the undervalued Red Dragon this movie lacks anything like tension, credible characters or a gripping plot. Instead we get the usual Ridley Scott lush visuals and buckets of gore so over done as to be laughable. Everyone would have been better off if Hannibal Lecter had eaten the script instead",Hannibal
640,stefanerikson,Adequate horrific sequel,6,9 January 2002,A rather good sequel to Silence of the lambs done by the master himself: Ridley Scott. The story is well told and the location scenes are brilliant. Specially the Rome scenes. Julianne Moore though is not as strong in tne role as Clarice like Jodie Foster but she´s no flop either. Anthony Hopkins is superb as usual but he never does a bad role. His acting is that rare kind of perfection that just some of the greatest actors can perform. He personifies Hannibal Lecter completely. This film however has not got the same dynamic thrill and chilling surprise as Silence of the lambs and the play between Hopkins and Moore is not as strong as the scenes with Foster. Anyway it´s a good sequel and some scenes are just to much for some peoples stomach. I give it a 6 of 10.,Hannibal
641,eXistenZial,What can be said?,6,9 February 2001,"Julianne Moore is not Clarice Starling for the first hour, she is someone closely mimicking the blueprint mapped out by Jodie Foster in Silence of the Lambs, and doing a damn poor job of it. But remarkably, I found her ""effort"" something to appreciate. From her first scene, waking up in the van, her eyes are set in ""must be different from Foster so I'll look determined not unsure"" mode. Later on though, her performance becomes more believable and you stop comparing her to her predecessor. As far as Sir Hopkins' performance goes, I have to say he's fantastic in everything he does, but it is inherently true that those who fell in love with his Lecter portrayal in Silence, may be in for a BIG disappointment with Hannibal, but this is no fault of his own. It's misdirection, a choppy script trying to pull action out of its a**e, among other things. Whomever decided to adapt the script this way needs to be fired. First of all, the movie does follow the book quite accurately in most places, but in the spots where it deviates, the viewer is left bitter and unsatisfied, ESPECIALLY with the ending. In the book we still see Lecter as this sort of omnipotent, cultured being, who just happens to eat people (just as we did with Silence), but in Hannibal that reflection is shown maybe 20 minutes out of the entire film, the rest showing him as this animalistic, cannibal beast that we should love only because his name is the title of the film. Any Lecter lover, would be p***ed at this portrayal, because it demeans and belittles the character.To Jodie Foster: Good choice for turning this project down.Gary Oldman is fantastic as Mason Verger. His portrayal was sinister and methodical and that's exactly as it should be for a character of Mason's definition. As far as the Mason Verger makeup f/x is concerned, the entire latex and foam surfacing over his face doesn't match his natural skin tone, which you can see when he opens his mouth (the lips) and his eyes. This makes the makeup just look ridiculous and overdone.All in all, if you've never read the book or seen Silence of the Lambs, the film might be nice for a weekend outing, but when looked at through the eye of a fan of the Lecter series, it might be a good choice to wait for cable.",Hannibal
642,jlarton,This film is being assessed unfairly!,7,18 February 2001,"To Begin, I would like to note that the film 'Hannibal' is the most recent entry in the Lecter trilogy. Manhunter (aka Red Dragon) in '86 was the initial entry, Silence Of The Lambs is the second.  Just as Manhunter and Silence Of The Lambs are two unique stories, with Hannibal Lecter playing a different role within these films, Ridley Scott's Hannibal is even more unique. The reason people did not enjoy this film was because Hollywood sequels are meant to cash in on the popularity of the previous entries, and grind out the same basic plot.  'Hannibal' the film was totally based on Thomas Harris's novel of the same name, with minor changes made (including the ending), but for the benefit of the viewer satisfaction.  The execution of this film is excellent, with Anthony Hopkins (63 years old!) and Julianne Moore (Jodie Foster would not be believable in this story), Gary Oldman, and Ray Liotta flushing out excellent characters.  Ridley Scott provides the most visually stunning entry in the trilogy, and Hans Zimmer provides a wonderfully eerie score.  Please do not make any more comparisons to Silence Of The Lambs- because the filmakers did not want to do something done before!The Director's Cut should be out on DVD in the winter, good eatin':>",Hannibal
643,t_baker,"Some nice visuals, but sacrifices WAY too much of the book...",5,12 February 2001,"The fanfare that greeted the novel ""Hannibal"" in 1999 quickly turned to controversy when audiences got a load of the book's perverse psychology and gore. Although I originally hated the book, particularly the bizarre (to put it mildly) climax, I've revised my opinion in the almost two years since--it remains vastly inferior to Thomas Harris's two earlier Lecter novels, but is still a compelling tour de force of abnormal psychology and a display of devastatingly smooth writing technique. Love it or loathe it, ""Hannibal"" is irrefutable proof that no writer working today does monsters as well as Harris; his creations are among the most nightmarishly memorable in popular American fiction, beings who can make you cringe, weep, and root for a nasty comeuppance all at the same time, characters both monstrously evil and sadly human.In all fairness, it must be said that Ridley Scott and company began work on the film version of ""Hannibal"" facing several disadvantages. First, they were tackling a sequel to a modern classic--Jonathan Demme, Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, and crew absolutely nailed The Silence of the Lambs, turning in a near-flawless film adaptation that cleaned up at both the box office and the Academy Awards. Second, they amplified the anticipation by doing it ten years later (although through no real fault of their own, since Harris took years to write Lecter's encore). Third, they're dealing with characters that have become icons, particularly Hannibal himself. Fourth, the book was enormously controversial--at one time, there was even speculation that Harris wrote it as he did to sabotage a film adaptation, bitter over how the success of the film Silence overshadowed his books (the reclusive author has since refuted that story). Demme and Foster opted out this time, citing their discomfort with the book's excesses, but they really may have well been afraid that they couldn't top themselves.In both its novel and film forms, The Silence of the Lambs stands as a veritable master class in the art of suspense, a propulsive, chilling manhunt for a serial killer that forces its protagonist to match wits with another monster, Dr. Lecter himself. But the novel Hannibal was altogether a different type of story, a psychological horror tale that deposited readers firmly in the wounded, dysfunctional psyches of its main characters and threatened to strand them there, a tour through layer after layer abnormal psychology that brought madness up close and personal, far too close for most readers' comfort.Where Ted Tally's Oscar-winning adaptation of Silence of the Lambs delivered an escalating spiral of suspense that stands up a decade later because it respected its source and trusted viewers to guide themselves through the thorny patches, the screenplay for Hannibal seems driven to re-invent the controversial material (the ending is completely re-worked) and winds up robbing the audience of the story's most compelling facets. Spoilers Alert On the page, Clarice Starling was bitter about the collapse of her once-promising career, a fall that was largely orchestrated by Justice Department official / cad Paul Krendler, a politically ambitious snake whose overriding flaw was his deep hatred and contempt for women, particularly successful ones. Mason Verger, Lecter's only surviving victim, was a horribly disfigured millionaire pedophile who conspired to have Lecter captured and eaten alive by slavering boars, and who acted in collusion with Krendler to dangle Starling as bait. But the movie lets us in on none of these characters' inner workings. Just as we don't know what makes Hannibal tick in this movie, we're given very little about Mason--both his relationship with his lesbian sister and his ""philanthropy"" with orphaned children are excised from the film version, so he's just a disfigured beast, and in one scene a ridiculously Jim Carrey-esque jester. You don't feel pity, hate, or much anything else for Mason--he's just sort of there. We don't get to know much about Clarice Starling, as re-interpreted by Julianne Moore, so we don't feel much for her or her constant battle with the FBI's glass ceiling. Krendler, whose smarminess, sexism, and contempt for Starling were driving forces of the novel, is given a tossed-off reference to a failed pass at Starling as the reason for his hate; but even his spite doesn't seem particularly hateful, just oily, tacky and cheap.Worst of all, the title character is now almost played for laughs. In fact, the packed-house audience at the screening I attended giggled during Lecter's biggest moments, a reaction that would probably make author Harris's hair stand on end--his most potent and sinister creation has become, thanks to celluloid, a populist sideshow farce.Moore fills in admirably for Jodie Foster, and Hopkins, clearly comfortable in his most famous role, turns in a smooth, effortless performance. Ridley Scott does what he can visually, although you'd expect nothing less than great visuals from him.In the end, watching ""Hannibal"" unfold on the screen is like taking the cover off of a silver dining tray and finding a baloney and cheese sandwich. The presentation is great, and you'll probably eat it, but it just isn't nearly as satisfying as the meal you were hoping for.",Hannibal

OK ""Silence of the lambs"" has more suspense than this one but ""Hannibal"" is still entertaining. It keeps you sitting on the front of your seat! The dialogues are very good too and we see Dr. Lecter on duty. The brain scene is very shocking in my opinion! Ray Liotta plays it perfect! He gives the moment a dark humor. And Gary Oldman as Mason Verger. It is his best role ever. Julianne Moore is good too but not as good as Jodie Foster. This movie has a great atmosphere, is full of suspense, especially everytime when Antony Hopkins appears, and a bit of very funny dark humor!

646,realitybites87,"Terrifying, Disgusting, yet incredibly intriguing.",6,11 February 2001,"Title:  Hannibal (2001) Director:  Ridley Scott Stars:  Anthony Hopkins, Julianne Moore Length:  135 min. (2 hours and 15 minutes) Rating:  R  Rated R for excessive amounts of gore, some nudity, sexual situations, and some language. Review:  ***Dr. Hannibal Lecter, M.D.  Intelligent, brilliant, yet chaotic and tumultuous personality.  Did I mention cannibalistic?  Well, he is.  And in Hannibal, Ridley Scott (Gladiator, Alien) doesn't have one problem showing that.  So, just given that bit of information, you can only guess the plot of the follow-up of the 1991 Best Picture masterpiece The Silence of the Lambs. One of the first few people you see in Hannibal is a survivor of one of Dr. Lecter's attacks (don't worry, I will not give away the movie).  You can only imagine what his face looks like.  Got a picture of him?  OK.  Well, his face is shown plenty in the movie, and it just gets so disgusting and tiring to look at this guy you want to stop eating your popcorn.  If you haven't seen the end of The Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal Lecter escapes his cell and is at large at the end of the movie.  So, that right there leads into Hannibal.  He's at large, he's angry, and he's hungry.Clarice Starling, FBI agent, is back on the case of the search for Hannibal.  Though, you sit through the whole movie wondering where Jodie Foster is.  Why am I looking at Julianne Moore?  Though, I am not complaining.  I would rather see Jodie Foster than Moore, but you must admit Moore does carry out the part of Starling fairly well.  The first hour of the movie displays how the FBI came to be in such distress about finding Dr. Lecter, and also shows an officer in Florence, Italy wanting to find Hannibal.  By the way, Dr. Lecter is in Italy (that gives away nothing). After this extremely slow beginning, the police officer in Italy tries to capture Hannibal for a 3 million dollar reward.  All the while you are wondering, I thought Clarice Starling was the main character in the movie. Where is she?  I haven't seen her for about 30 minutes.After this hour gradually goes by, Dr. Lecter becomes the murderous, hungry cannibal you made him out to be.  His personality is so complex, so intriguing, and so enigmatic, that it is tremendously fun watching the notorious Anthony Hopkins (thank God he wasn't replaced) playing Hannibal. But, then, you find out that the deformed survivor that you saw for about 10 minutes in the beginning has to form another plot twist where the camera must show his face for a while longer.  He wants Hannibal Lecter dead, and he wants the reward.  Meanwhile, Hannibal doesn't care about getting caught, he just wants to find the person, who in The Silence of the Lambs, he found so fascinating:  Agent Clarice Starling.  The only problem is, you got so excited watching one character's personality, that you expect the other main character's personality to get explained.  But, unfortunately, Scott obviously thought that was displayed well enough in The Silence of the Lambs.  Now, Lecter is in a dilemma, but as intelligent as he is, he has the ability to squirm his way out. The last 30 minutes of Hannibal is so intense that the flaws in the first 100 minutes become almost nonexistent, but, unfortunately, they remain in your memory because they were so disgusting.  Though, just when you thought the most scary scene in any movie ever made occurs, Ridley Scott must turn it into an almost comic position.  In addition to that, Scott also puts in a gory scene that is so unbelievably stupid, far-fetched, and disgusting that you almost want to vomit.  Also in this scene, the characters displayed in the movie leading up to this part seem as if they are totally different characters.  Were the makers of this film in a rush or did they just stop caring? However, the set and original music are pretty amazing to watch.  The cinematography is also fairly good, but in some scenes could have been polished or thought about better.  Anyone who watches this movie must admit that there is too much gore that you just get sick of watching.  I have to confess that it got so disturbing for me to watch that I found myself closing my eyes in parts.  Some parts of this film are also so cheesy that even I could've written a better solution.  To be frank with you, it took me about 30 minutes of deciding whether to give this movie **, **1/2, or *** because you leave the movie with so many mixed feelings.  Giving it *** is me being pretty nice.  Yet, Hannibal is a movie worth seeing because it carries out Hannibal Lecter's personality very well, just what you were expecting (hence the name of the movie). If you have not seen this film DO NOT READ PAST THIS COLON:  I just hope there isn't going to be a third chapter to this movie (not counting the 1986 horrid movie Manhunter).",Hannibal
647,JoeFreezy,"This movie went nowhere, but at least it dragged",2,9 February 2001,"When my friend first told me that the book wasn't even that good, I first thought that this movie was going to suck, for lack of a better word. But I remembered that it was a Ridley Scott picture, which gave it hope in my eyes.  Not that he is the greatest of directors, but Gladiator was a great picture, and it's hard to believe that he would regress so much in less than a year.As I was walking out of the theater, this same friend said that the book was SO much better, and I can't stress SO enough.  This movie went nowhere, but at least it dragged.  At least I had the pleasure of sitting through a long, dull picture in an uncomfortable movie theater.  If only you could be so lucky?This just goes to show you how even the most skilled directors can't turn bad material into a good movie.  Look at John Woo's Mission Impossible 2.  But at least MI2 had good action scenes toward the end.  This movie was supposed to be gory and violent.  2 disturbing scenes, the wild boars and the brain scene, which lasted a total of 10 minutes tops, does not make an entire 131 minute picture into a gore feast.  But I will say that I did enjoy the flashback scene with Anthony Hopkins and Gary Oldman.  That was rather entertaining.  And oh yeah, the brain scene, which was rather disgusting, was pretty amusing.If you've already seen the movie, I feel for you, as you should feel for me.  For those of you who haven't seen it, but have seen Silence of the Lambs, keep it that way.  And for those of you who have even seen Silence of the Lambs, I'd highly recommend that you stop by a video store and pick up a copy.

649,JeremyZ,Pretty darn awful,3,24 February 2001,"Hannibal is a good movie gone horribly wrong.  The first half or so of the film, with its lush scenery and excellent cinematography, captured my attention and was quite entertaining.  However, all went south once Dr. Lechter arrived in the US.  His capture by his nemesis (whose name eludes me) is just plain stupid.  Clarice's actions following this are even more unbelievable.  Details?  Need I mention the man-eating pigs (irony? please!), the bizarre Italian goons, Clarice's Darrell Hammond-impersonating-George W. Bush boss, and the final, absurd dinner scene?  I tried to explain the movie to my roommates, and couldn't help but think about how stupid the whole thing was.  This is yet another bad movie in a sea of bad movies.

650,henman,depends on the mood,8,10 February 2001,"While I liked this movie very much, I know that this is not for everyone. This movie takes a large departure from the original, and probably should be considered a stand alone film. This movie stays true to most of the main points of the book. Ridley Scott does an all right job directing, however there were points when I felt that he was trying to show off, using shots that made no sense , but looked good. The acting was good, not great. The movie in parts also seemed to plod along, stretching out to almost 2 and a half hours. If you are in the right mood to sit through some intense gore, then this movie is a must see.

651,ledobg3,"Disastrously absurd, incredibly pales by comparison to Silence of the Lambs",1,1 March 2001,"I have just spent 130 minutes of an agonizingly bad experience at the movies. I'm a Ridley Scott fan, but I hate to admit this has to be his worst film ever, it seems as if he was in a rush to finish it, and added a bit of his trademark slow motion ala Gladiator here and there just to make sure the directing wasn't so dull and commonplace.To me, this story was meant to be totally real from the start, and that's what made it frightening and thought provoking. Nevertheless, Hannibal is filled with unbelievable events at every turn, dozens of them, so much that at one point I had the feeling I was watching Friday the 13th with a $90million budget + big marketing $$, not to mention an Oscar winning (and absolutely deserving) predecessor. I was specially displeased with the image it portrays of Italy and its people: a wretched third world country with a moronic police force.The story ended up being nothing at all like the original, with absurd transformations in the characters. I understand 10 years have gone by, but Clarice is nothing AT ALL like the old one, no wonder Jodie Foster wasn't up for it (whether it was the money she was asking for as rumored, or not), and she wouldn't have been appropriate for the role anyway.",Hannibal

It is bad on so many levels it is hard to know where to start.  The writing was poor, it wasn't at all true to the charachters created in the first movie (and I watched Silence right before going to see Hannibal).  Anthony Hopkins did his best with what he had, but this Hannibal Lecter was unbeleivable compared to what we know he can do. Also, I feel Hannibal Lecter himself would have been dissapointed with this movie. It was crass, unrefined, and he would have found it rude. There was none of the delicious subtlety we were hoping for, only bloody gore reminicent of a bad B-horror movie.  It was crude, and disgusting. Julianne Moore was a completely unbeleivable Starling, with none of the spunk Jodie Foster gave the character.  It was painful to watch her try to fill Oscar winning shoes, and to be honest she should not have tried.  The cinematography was poor, the lighting, the directing, etc. The only redeemable factor was the music... watch for the piece Anthony Hopkins composed.

663,dmyriounis,"A totally different beast from the ""Silence of the Lambs"".",10,21 November 2010,"""Hannibal"" takes everything that worked perfectly on ""Silence of the Lambs"" and tosses them overboard. And the film still works. Gone is the claustrophobic look of ""Silence"" that created tangible tension. Instead, in ""Hannibal"" Dr Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) is free to wreak havoc and spell doom for the people of Florence. The change of scenery is welcome and extends the movie's scope as well as working as an allegory of how far-reaching evil can be and how quickly it can spread.Also gone is the serial killer plot mechanism that drove ""Silence"" so successfully providing the film with focus. Well, ""Hannibal"" doesn't need that, because by now we've met the characters, we know their way of thinking, we've witnessed their malice and their heroism. Their interactions are no longer in a professional context but rather a personal one. There are two story lines: one concerning the exploits of a free Hannibal Lecter living across the ocean under the alias of Dr Fell (or is it Dr Hell?) and another following the attempts of a Lecter former-patient-turned-victim to arrest him and bring him to justice (or some man-eating boars). The two separate story lines soon merge and all hell breaks loose.Finally, gone is Jodie Foster along with her paternal figure Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn). In her shoes steps the able Julianne Moore and she doesn't disappoint. Her Clarice Starling is entirely different from Foster, more battle-scarred and urgent as the role requires (after all 10 years in the F.B.I. can turn you into something like that). Furthermore, gone seems to be morality. The austere but loving authority figure of Crawford is replaced with the sleazy, backstabbing misogynist Paul Krendler (Ray Liotta). As for the villain of the piece, Lecter certainly isn't he. And that's because his surviving victim, filthy wealthy child molester, faceless Mason Verger (Gary Oldman) fulfills the role remarkably. Verger may be a victim but he is not victimized. He is a heartless, vindictive, manipulative sadist, living only to torment, his only redeeming quality being his dark sense of humor. As for Lecter's nemesis in Florence (or is it vice versa?), Inspector Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini) only cares for Verger's bounty on Hannibal's head, obstructing American justice by scheming to deliver Lecter to the deranged billionaire. The performances are excellent throughout, with Hopkins towering over everybody like a colossus. ""Hannibal"" puts him dead center, unlike the periphery of ""Silence"" and proves that Lecter is a superhuman, an all-devouring Leviathan, a metaphorical pinnacle of uncontrollable evil. By contrast, Verger's choice of evil seems to be conscientious. Gary Oldman, Julianne Moore, Giancarlo Giannini and Ray Liotta all shine, even when their roles are somewhat one-note. All in all, Ridley Scott's ""Hannibal"" is an atmospheric and tasteful grand guignol, with its delicious over-the-top tone working as a study in the nature of evil. A worthy successor to the ""Silence of the Lambs"".",Hannibal

665,quo-1,Slightly Disappointed,6,2 September 2001,"I went in to this film trying to keep an open mind about it.  The Silence of the Lambs was a really tough act to follow, and I tried to keep that in mind so I could be objective about ""Hannibal"".  Unfortunately, try as I might I just couldn't help but compare the two.  Hannibal just didn't do it for me, however, it was no fault of Hopkins, who delivers yet another brilliant performance.  His Hannibal is every bit as loathesome and eerie as he is supposed to be, and he literally sent chills down my spine sometimes. Other than that, the plot was thin and weak.  What was with the obsession with wild boars?  I couldn't help but laugh about that.  Overall it seemed to me that the plot was hastily contrived to act as a vehicle for one of the greatest villains ever to hit the movie screen.  Worth a look on video, but don't feel too bad if you missed it in the theaters.",Hannibal
666,vaughn-21,"""What a disappointment!""",4,21 December 2001,"""What a disappointment!"" This was the phrase uttered by my companion the second the end credits for ""Hannibal"" began to roll. It was disappointing, watching ""Hannibal"" is like seeing a reunion tour of your favorite band and realizing that they have not aged well. (this metaphor uses ""The Silence of the Lambs"" as the original band than ""Manhunter,"" the first Lector movie,)In keeping with this comparison Julianne Moore would be the new guy in the band that cannot hold a candle to the member that she replaced. Jodi Foster's Agent Starling emotionally vulnerable, smart, and vivacious; Moore is an ice queen, an android programmed to act, that seems to be going through the motions. Not only that but the character is less interesting in ""Hannibal"" Starling plays the victim at every turn, even the old ""turn in your badge"" routine followed by setting out after the crook on your own plot devise is used here.Lector is just as interesting but less likable than he was in ""Lambs."" In ""Lambs"" he was a James Bond villain (charming, intelligent, hyper-civilized, with an insatiable bloodlust) but in ""Lambs"" he could only charm, insult and escape. Now that he is free he is the same character but one that is capable of acting out all the evil he wishes. Now rather than charming the audience he is repulsive to them, repulsive to all but the most sadistic audience members, the type that would enjoy a snuff video in their private moments. Hopkins, who is mesmerizing in almost everything he does, seems to be doing an impression of his performance in ""Lambs"" rather than embodying Lector as he had.Director Ridley Scott's films lack any semblance of emotional warmth, they also have an ""anything worth doing is worth over doing"" philosophy about them. The former quality keeps his films from being truly great (exception ""Alien"") but the latter has managed to if nothing else keep his work from being boring. This film is no exception. The build ups are well done but the payoffs are irresolute; they are too gruesome to be taken seriously and are too explicit in their depiction of human suffering to be viewed as black comedy. One can either blame Scott for ruining a macabre masterpiece or thank him for giving this mess a reason to be watched. I'll do the latter.",Hannibal

""Silence of the Lambs"" is one of the best films of all time, one of my top ten, so I ventured to this film on opening day. When a film is a sequel there is naturally expectations, especially a sequel to a best picture. Along with the horrible acting of Julianne Moore the major problem was the fact that the story line was not developed AT ALL and the relationship between Hannibal and Clarice was not explained. Love? well, in the ""Silence"" there was a definite special attraction and companionship, but without explanation, ""Hannibal"" has the two in a romantic, sexual relationship. Where did this come from? Why? The movie seemed more Freddy Crougar than psychological thriller and the focus was on the gore rather than the meaning behind it. The flagrant use of advertising (Gucci) was literally the worst I've ever seen in a film. This movie is not even worth any more of my time because it was the WORST film I have ever seen. The only thing friends could say to explain the movie was ""Well, it was explained more in the book"". Great. I'll go read the book.",Hannibal

Other than that it falls a bit flat.  Upon reflection the saddest part about the movie is the constant attempts at shock value and the paper thin plot.  No one does anything for any real reason, which is the strangest part, except Hannibal.Also, Hannibal is the only character that is cool, funny, and dare I say, human.  All the other characters seem more like caricatures, and Moore was terrible as Agent Starling.This movie got 6 stars JUST for Anthony Hopkins and he is certainly the best part about the film.  He makes you forget that the plot goes no where and after 2 1/2 hours the movie was no closer to resolving itself than it was in the beginning. Sadly, Hannibal Lecture is going to be the next Freddy or Jason, lets just hope he continues to be exciting and witty as he has been in these two movies.",Hannibal
670,pallenbrown,Anybody but Ms. Moore as Agent Starling,7,6 July 2008,"The entire film was nearly a masterpiece, but for the weak performance turned in my Julianne Moore. Any of the other actresses considered for the part would have done better. It's a shame, but this film suffered for her presence. The performance of Sir Hopkins makes it worth watching aside from that.Better perhaps would be to watch Red Dragon. Solid performances from both Hopkins and Norton make it a film worth watching more so than this supposed 'sequel' to Silence of the Lambs. That said, any of these movies is better than the later release ""Hannibal Rising"" which was a terribly acted, poorly produced, piece of third-world celluloid trash unworthy of the ""Hannibal"" moniker.",Hannibal

But stories in his movies, sometimes, confused and controversial. This happent this time also.
Starling behaves very unpredictable. She cares about victims of Hannibal and tries to stop him. But SAVES him in the end. She deffinately was not stupid in the Silence of the Lambs, and understand firstly in this movie who is Hannibal, how dangerous this guy. But why she saves him? Is he a victim? Did she want to put him in a mental hospital again and have talkes with him? She didn't look like a person who enjoyed talkes with him before.

Naturally, I was hoping this to be good, but I was truly disappointed.Most of the cast is doing good job, the movie looks and sounds good, and the story is quite good. The main problem is that the script is awful. The movie is full of plot holes and it is really hard to believe the story because of the constant stupidity and unrealism. There is some excitement built in many scenes but it is killed almost instantly because of something ridiculous. There is the same dark atmosphere and tension as in the Silent of the lambs, but it just doesn't hold up. It seems that the whole movie was designed to have few nice scenes, but the writers/director didn't have any idea how to tie them up. The movie jumps from one situation to another without fully ending each situation.The intelligent and morbid Hannibal from the other movies is replaced with a lucky snob with so many talents that makes Superman look like an invalid. Hannibal is just going around without any problems although he is been chased by the FBI, local police and some bounty hunters. It is just ludicrous what he can do without getting caught! He could like walk right into the White House and take a nap at the oval office while the president is having a meeting there. There are no intelligent schemes behind anything he does. Hannibal just does what ever he wants and always happens to be in the right place at the right time. The whole thing is like watching the three stooges trying to capture oiled superman in a serious and grim movie.The movie isn't boring in traditional sense. There's a lot going on, but since there is no interest in what ever happens, it gets dull to watch very fast. For a movie lasting over two hours it's not a good feature. Overall, this could have been a great movie, but the constant surreal stupidity destroys the whole potential of this rubbish movie.",Hannibal

674,Kessler1996,The Movie Many Loved To Hate... Reasons For Which Are Beyond Me,9,31 October 2011,"You need only say the name ""Ridley Scott"" and those enlightened enough to even know of such a person will automatically divert their trail of thought to 'Gladiator' (2000). I can't see why, but I would suspect that this is a common occurrence due to the appeal it had (I am yet to see such an 'appeal'), presented by Russell Crowe's limp-wristed war cries and his ""flattering"" Roman outfit. Ooh, yah, everyone does love an awesome sword fight, huh? Certainly, that Oscar win for 'Best Picture' will definitely oppose my argument, but that movie for me is the single dollop of mud flicked on the pristine whiteness that is the imagination of Mr. Scott. As a representative ambassador to the perpetual abundance of talent within Ridley, that film is most certainly not the one I would have presented. That position, I believe, belongs to 'Hannibal' (2001). Following the colossal success of its 1991 predecessor, 'The Silence Of The Lambs', adapted from Thomas Harris's best-selling 1988 novel, this sequel 'Hannibal' was vastly anticipated. Harris's successive novel of the same name was also hugely anticipated, and, upon release in June 1999, was met with a generally positive reception. The irrefutable delectability of the talents involved in its cinematic adaptation enticed audiences greatly. Even to the extent of an internationally record-breaking release in February 2001, garnering itself a Guinness World Record for ""the highest box-office gross for a film with an over- 18 rating on an opening weekend."" Its success seemed inevitable - Anthony Hopkins reprises one of his most celebrated roles, a screenplay adaptation by literary masters David Mamet and Steven Zaillian, John Mathieson's glorious cinematography encapsulates the fluently remarkable scenery of Florence in all its architectural perfection, and the delightful addition of director Ridley Scott and his eye for aesthetics. Of course, no-one will care about that. No-one has for ten years. And that is primarily the most infuriating concept; the gross philistinism that these critics have with their deprivation of this film's deserved reputation of meticulousness. To them, it's wiped clean off the Earth! Over-shadowed by 'Silence', of course. That's to be expected. But one can still acknowledge brilliance even if it does sit on the Second Place stand of the winners' podium. Director Ridley Scott can be credited for other, first-class, achievements, such as the captivatingly terrifying claustrophobia of 'Alien' (1979). But the immediate and unimaginative connection people make between his work and 'Gladiator' (2000) is just irritating. Of all of Scott's directional achievements, 'Hannibal' remains as his greatest. While its predecessor relied on Dr. Lecter's rather grotesque, skin- crawling interaction with FBI Special Agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster in Oscar-winning form) behind the safety glass of his colourless cell to get its chills from the audience, this sequel was more challenging. With Hannibal Lecter gloriously at liberty in Florence, he appears so much more suave, charming. Elegant. He becomes the man he showed himself to be when deprived of the company of his cannibalistic counterparts. It accurately follows the concept that he could be walking across the road from you and you'd be oblivious. Only one thing disturbs his freedom: corrupted police Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi. Blinded by money, he foolishly stalks Lecter after learning that his alias, ""Dr. Fell"", curator of the library of The Palazzo Capponi, is a façade. Giancarlo Giannini plays this character well, a character that can be personified as the manipulative snake in the Garden Of Eden.The screenplay for me is quite the highlight. The story of this all is rather basic, but enjoyable nonetheless. It may well be simplistic, and unarguably unrealistic at times, but it has a comfortable pace. It unravels itself gradually and lets the thing evolve nicely from there on. A story of corruption, revenge, hatred, and avarice, this film is such a wonderful experience to endure. Also, it is immersed deeply in revolting characters, their characteristics shown so clearly as to disallow any ambiguousness. What you see really is what you get. In addition to this, it is scattered with snide insults. From the spitting venom of the hideous Mason Verger (Gary Oldman, plastered in astounding, intricate facial make-up) to the sophisticated verbal assault of Lecter. Anthony Hopkins seizes this new opportunity of a ""free Lecter"" admirably, at last able to confront Clarice Starling outside of his cell. In the film's finale (a scene I treasure in my memory eternally), amidst the setting of the immaculately sartorial dining room, Hopkins has the greatest chance to really bite. The dialogue written, similar to the chastising Lecter gave Starling in 'Silence' (""A well scrubbed, hustling rube with a little taste.""), is spiteful. Truly. So vindictive and obvious is it, rubbing the salt directly into the wound, so to speak, that it almost seems thoughtful. The finale is the best part of the movie, where Julianne Moore really shines as Starling. Having been rather blunt earlier in the film's pursuit/set-up, here she shows her immovable incorruptibility as Starling, showing no weakness despite the acid that is shot at her most personal features by Lecter: her pride as an Agent. The script really nails that, belittling her, unpicking every fibre of her capabilities in a stunning array of composure and patronising. This is an ending that I can only stand alongside 'The Usual Suspects' (1995) for levels of sheer awe and satisfaction. Granted, 'Hannibal' may not be as good as its predecessor 'Silence' in some ways, but don't forget about it. It redeems itself, I kid you not.",Hannibal

Now i first saw H at the movies on it's release, i wasn't overly impressed but i actually bought the DVD when it was released as i felt i may have missed something. Well after my third viewing this evening i have to say i've wasted nearly 6 hours of my life on a movie that has absolutely no redeeming features. I will never view it again. The scriptwriters when faced with a selection of some of the most unpleasant characters ever submitted to film resorted to some extremely lazy options. It's like they said ""OK we have to make Hannibal the anti hero here, but he maims and kills quite a few innocents, any ideas? Well we could make the Italian policeman corrupt, make him shop in Hannibal all for the sake of a few bucks rather than going through the correct authorities, yeah that would work. How about this Verger geezer, he was mutilated by Lectors sadism and now wants revenge.I know lets make him a paedophile, brilliant. Oh and just for kicks lets turn Clarice into a dumb broad who makes one stupid decision after another, man we've nailed it, surefire hit."" I cannot fathom how anyone gets anything out of this film, i enjoyed Silence and Red Dragon and to a lessor degree Manhunter, they were all intelligent to at least a reasonable level.

Julianne Moore holds her in taking over from Jody Foster and of course Anthony Hopkins is simply, Anthony Hopkins. He's one of the great actors of our generation.However, when I saw this movie I was simply disgusted and disturbed. Without going into further details, the beginning of the movie with the crack mom getting killed with her baby attached to her really disturbed me and it went down hill from there. It's really unfortunate the impression this movie made on me that has great actors, well played roles, and wonderful scenery.The only thing that stands out in this movie, to me anyway, is the disgusting and disturbing nature of many of the scenes on this movie.",Hannibal

While his comment was well written, I couldn't disagree with him more. I have read all of Thomas Harris' books, most of them at least twice, and really love his writing style and the characters he brings to life in the 'Lecter' books. There is no doubt whatsoever that 'Silence' was a better adaptation; it is scene by scene the same as the book. From the actors portrayal of the characters down to the dialogue, it's almost identical. It even won the Oscar for best screenplay adaption. 'Hannibal' on the other hand, is an atrocity as a movie. From the downgrade to Julianne Moore as Starling, to the blatant changes and omissions to the story, it's a sad thing that the beautiful movie hidden inside this book was never discovered by Ridley Scott and crew. Even Gary Oldman couldn't save this one. I'll spare the details of the numerous errors in judgement of whoever ""adapted"" this book, and convey my frustration with just one example: Verger's muscle-bound lesbian sister doesn't even exist in the movie!!! She was a major player in the story, from an awkward sexual scene with Barney to the fact that SHE KILLED VERGER... and to just omit her character completely? I won't even start on the butchered ending. That's Hollywood I guess.",Hannibal

680,pb-2,Coulda been a contenda,8,12 February 2001,"I will certainly see Hannibal again and again, so overall I liked it. But I left the theater thinking: how sad that this will be the one movie to be made from Thomas Harris's book; wouldn't it have been nice if they could have brought in Jonathan Demme to tone down some of Ridley Scott's excesses. Of these, the worst for me was how unbearably loud the background music was at times(I am hoping, hoping, hoping this was an artefact courtesy of the theater I was in, and the next time I see it will be easier on the ears). I also would have preferred the slicked-back smarmy bureaucratic Paul Krendler of Silence of the Lambs to the arrogant frat-boy role nonetheless well-performed by Ray Liotta. Julianne Moore is superb as Clarice; the concern about not having Jodie Foster can be laid to rest, and an argument can be made that this vintage Clarice is a better role for Julianne than Jodie anyway.Now I'll issue a SPOILER ALERT - beep, beep, beep. The major alteration from the book is to do away with the evolution of the Clarice/Hannibal relationship into a romance, as Clarice transcends her sense of duty and Hannibal... well, I'm not sure exactly what Hannibal did - perhaps allow himself to feel, however NewAge that sounds - and replace it with a theme of unrequited love in the face of mutual respect. That Clarice's final act of duty is one-upped by Hannibal's self-sacrifice, or at least a piece of himself, is a very nice touch, beyond which it gets rid of that nasty xray problem!!!

688,Siskel-7,"A Different Movie Than ""The Silence of the Lambs"", but No Less Brilliant!",10,10 February 2001,"Hannibal Does Not Disappoint Hannibal is not the ""The Silence of the Lambs"".  Anyone who expects this will be disappointed, I imagine.  But how could it be the same?  This film has a new director (Ridley Scott), new screenwriters (David Mamet and Steven Zaillian), and a new Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore).  These are four very accomplished substitutes.  However, they have different styles. Therefore, Hannibal should be treated as a separate film. I will start off by saying that Hannibal is not for everyone.  There is a lot more gore in this film than in ""Lambs"".  But, if you can handle it, you must see this film.  It is spectacular.  There is a scene in this film which showed something I have never seen before.  I could not sit still during the climax.  It was just too exciting. What an amazing directing job by Ridley Scott.  A major improvement over last year's lackluster blockbuster ""Gladiator"".  It is flashier than Demme's directing style, but no less effective.  Scott uses the most amazing makeup effects, interesting editing, and an amazing score by Hans Zimmer.  Zimmer does a beautiful job of combining his score with stylish opera music.  I hope Hannibal gets a number of technical Academy Award nominations next year. The entire cast is solid.  Julianne Moore does her best with Starling. She is not Jodie Foster, but she does a fine job nonetheless.  The supporting performances are excellent.  Ray Liotta plays a corrupt cop.  It is nice to see him in a good movie;  it's been too long.  Giacarlo Giannini plays an Italian police officer who discovers that he has stumbled upon Hannibal Lecter in Florence.  But the most fun is seeing the performance of Mason Verger.  He is a former Lecter victim, who wants to find Lecter to get revenge.  This is an unbilled, unrecognizable actor whose identity I will not reveal.  The fun of this film is trying to figure out who it is.  But you have to wait until the end credits to discover his identity.  This is an Oscar worthy performance. However, the man who owns Hannibal is the man who was talked about ten years ago when audiences first saw him standing behind the glass.  A man who has created one of the most memorable horror movie characters of all time; the great Sir Anthony Hopkins.  This is his film.  Hopkins does not disappoint.  He slides back into Lecter like no time has passed between the two films.  Hopkins not only deserves another Oscar nomination.  He probably deserves to win his second Academy Award.  It is too early to say, but this is a tour-de-force performance.  I was not disappointed. In fact, I was not disappointed with anything about this movie.  I was exhilarated by its unique beauty.  There is nothing but horror and gore throughout, which probably should have earned it a Canadian `R' (American NC-17) rating.  Yet, at the same time, it is done with so much style that one feels like they have just looked at a great painting or a symphony.  I will support this movie all year;  despite what others may say.  This is one of the year's best films. 4 stars out of 4",Hannibal
689,karry,"Good, but not as good as expected",7,14 February 2001,"I like Anthony Hopkins.  I like thrillers.  I like movies that make you think.  I was really looking forward to seeing Hannibal.  I was disappointed.  I thought Silence Of The Lambs was an excellent movie and with it's major success at the box office and DVD sales I assumed they would put a lot more effort into the sequel, Hannibal.  It just didn't seem to have the same ""edge of your seat"" appeal.  In fact, I found most of the movie pretty boring.  The only shocker in the whole movie was in the last 15 minutes at the dinner table.  Other than that, it could have been a movie of the week on TV.  I will still buy the DVD to complete the trilogy but it won't be one that I watch again and again.",Hannibal
690,FischerMax,Unbelievable,1,12 February 2001,"I am totally taken back by all of the positive reviews for this movie.  It seems that we all missed (were too young for) the opening weekend bandwagon for Silence and are all too eager to jump aboard the one for Hannibal. Hopkins was laughable as Lecter.  What happened to the mystery he displayed in Silence?  The cat was an open book without a plot.  Then there's the nonsense of Julianne Moore.  Is there any question as to why Jodie Foster refused the role?  This is not the Clarice Starling that I know.  This is some Hollywood distorted trash concocted to make a few bucks.  This brings me to Ridley Scott.  Just because someone makes a few big budget, fiscally successful movies doesn't mean that their a wonderful director.  Under those guidelines, Jerry 'Satan' Bruckheimer should receive accolades.  Again, it's not really a mystery that Jonathan Demme wasn't at the helm for this one. Then there's the controversy over David Mamet receiving a writing credit. What a ploy!  Mamet did a first draft of the screenplay which was (obviously) completely dumped by the guy who wrote the final draft.Please, avoid this rubbish.",Hannibal
691,aggieduck_75,Unbelieveabal,4,9 February 2001,"I can't believe this was made into a movie. This was a horrible story and the characters from ""Silence of the Lambs"" deserved a better ending than this. Let me start out by saying that there were many good things in the film. The way it was shot was very pretty, especially the scenes in Italy. I even thought that Julianne Moore did a good job in her role. I feel very sorry that her performance is not based on her own ability, but how she compares to Jodie Foster. Pazzi was also a wonderful, and maybe the only complex character in the film. I also liked the opening drug bust scene. After that it seems to get a little flat, in fact very flat. The story showed too much Hannibal and thereby gave us too much of a good thing. Hannibal Lecter is a character that we are fascinated with, yet we know we cannot like. We cannot like him because of his killer nature, but he intrigues us. In this film we really see the dark side of him and it ends up being too much. His actions become predictable and some of his lines are meant as comic relief, when clearly there should be no comedy in this movie. There were a few moments of nervous laughter courtesy of Mr. Verger, but should there have been? I don't think this movie should have had any comic relief. The gore present in this movie is a replacement for any psychological tension brought about by the previous film. Gone is the fierce questioning of Starling by Lecter that we know pained her so much. Also gone is the creativity and cunning in which Lecter was able to kill, (talking Miggs to death.) This film was just not near as frightening as the previous. People will see it because they have waited ten years to find out what happened, but I hope that it is not the phenomenon that its prequel was. I myself will pretend that Hannibal was last known to be, ""...having an old friend for dinner.""",Hannibal
692,mjr_8,Horrible direction from Ridley Scott,4,12 February 2001,"The whole movie feels misdirected by Ridley Scott. Personally, I am a fan of most of Scott's films, but I really feel like he dropped the ball on this one. All of the suspense, terror, and intrigue are drained from Hannibal's predecessor to create a film that is just lifeless. How can a movie with so much violence be so utterly boring? How can said violence leave so little impact upon the viewer. This movie will be immediately forgotten by most. I can't help but think that a much better movie could have been made with a different director at the helm. Hannibal would have benefited from the use of some restraint, some subtlety to increase the tension. How can a film like Silence, in which the characters and their interesting relationships are explored against a ghastly backdrop, be followed up with a film that literally has no interesting or profound character interaction. It was filled with the standard cliched detective dialogue that just moves the story along (slowly I might add) to the unsatisfying now-famous ending. For instance, the scene where Mason Verger's disfigurement takes place could have been replaced by a simple monologue from Verger to Starling that would have been a treat for the actors and audiences alike. Instead of being feed a scene that could have been directed by any Hollywood hack, a simple dialogue scene could have been far more haunting and effective. Hannibal the movie is perhaps one of the worst novel to screen adaptations I have ever witnessed (Battlefield Earth withstanding). This movie lacks passion, originality, and most importantly energy. I was happy the movie was over so I could go home and watch Silence again. Even after 10 viewings, I still can get goosebumps. How could Ridley Scott fall so far! (3 out of 10)",Hannibal
693,hmaure,Thrilled with the Disillusionment!,10,13 February 2001,"I fully expected to dislike this film from the moment I heard Jodie Foster had turned down the role. Who else could play Clarice Starling?Julianne Moore.Within the first five minutes of her character's appearance, I forgot my prejudices and was enraptured. Her performance is, simply put, magnificent. Anthony Hopkins plays the title character to the hilt, never once diminishing the presence he established in Silence of the Lambs, but rather enhancing the disturbing allure of the Doctor. The timing of the plot is impeccable, the direction is everything one could expect from Ridley Scott, and the supporting actors' performances are good, solid grace notes to the symphony on screen.As for the ending, which was changed from the original: the story has more cohesion in the film. The film version just makes more sense than the ending in the book. After all, Hannibal's attraction to Clarice is largely dependent on her integrity. I believe that this film is a fitting sequel to the Silence of the Lambs. Rarely has disillusionment been so pleasing, as when I discovered that all of my misgivings regarding Hannibal were unfounded.",Hannibal
694,jfaircloth,Don't bother.,4,27 August 2001,"Anthony Hopkins, Ray Liotta, Gary Oldman and Julianne Moore are four of my favorite actors.  But even they could not save this movie from itself.""Silence of the Lambs"" was a great psychological thriller, exploring the developing relationship between a brilliant (but imprisoned) serial killer and a young FBI agent.  Yes, it had its gory moments but they served their purpose.  ""Hannibal"" is nothing but a gore-fest...the film makers seemed hellbent on grossing out the audience more and more with each scene.  By the end, I was almost sick to my stomach (and I've seen some gory movies).The characters are severely underdeveloped and flat. Ray Liotta's character is 100% jerk, Gary Oldman's character (a survivor of a Lechter attack) is a nothing but a disfigured, vengeful rich guy who's very hard to feel sorry for. Even Clarice Starling herself is robot-like...she doesn't show the abject fear we saw in ""Silence.""  Maybe it's just because she's a hardened FBI agent now, but it's never really explained.Skip this stomach-churning piece of junk and read the book instead.",Hannibal

It certainly helps if you have read Hannibal beforehand (very carefully, I might add) but if you pay close attention to this film you will see that there is something interesting going on beneath the surface.  This time, Dr. Lecter is not going to give you the answers.  You'll have to figure it out on your own.

Hannibal's favorite musical work is Bach's Goldberg Variations, the important word here being variations.  Hannibal, Silence of the Lambs and Manhunter are all variations on a theme and as such must vary in tone and detail.  But the story is pretty much still the same. This time Hannibal takes the place of the serial killer and Mason becomes the evil man who helps the FBI.",Hannibal

However this film fell flat on it's face.The movie opens with an action scene that wouldn't look out of place on a bad TV show, it then carries on without any thought for pace.All the characters are under written, which shows mainly due to the complete lack of plot and some bland dialogue.  The much reported ""Ultra-Gore"" would have been more shocking if it wasn't for the pure stupidity of it all.Overall a bad film, badly written and badly made.",Hannibal
698,sm8,It's not the movie I don't understand...,1,12 August 2001,"What I don't understand are the attempts by some people to jump through hoops to validate this movie.  Maybe for love of the author's previous work. Maybe for love of the actors' previous films?  Maybe even to justify Ridley Scott's half-hearted attempts with this piece?Hannibal does not live up to its predecessor.  That's fine.  But, it should still be able to stand on its own - unfortunately it falls, hard and flat.If this had been penned and attempted to be sold without the support of the success of the previous movie, we'd have a direct-to-video release or something that would never have made it onto the producer's desk to begin with.When looking for holes I go play golf or eat some swiss cheese.  At the same time, I don't look for them in movies - nor do I look for cheese in movies.Juliane Moore has been an asset to many good films in my opinion.  In this role she is able to hold her own, but that isn't what this movie called for. Unfortunately this production very much needed Jodie Foster.  Like others, I also agree Ray Liotta's character was drab and poorly portrayed - I quite enjoyed him in other roles.  Even Anthony Hopkins I found just rolling through this film without much care for the character he was playing. Time...  Yes, 10 years have passed.  But characters and the story should still be painted in such a way that the viewer ""cares"" - I didn't.Hannibal was truly one of the most disappointing movies of the year.  With its limited production time and hurried editing, they really should have delayed the whole thing to fit into Foster's schedule and a few more drafts on the screenplay.The first deserves a prized position in anyone's movie collection. Hannibal deserves a complete pass.  Sorry, but there are far too many brilliant movies being made to let this one take up valuable space in my collection.",Hannibal

I'm sorry if I'm holding it up to the same bar as ""Silence ..""; I'd like to give it a negative score. Say, -20 stars.  I think Anthony just needs some money for a morgage, and probably the rest of them too.  Nothing but pretty filler (note: budget).  If I was to hold the movie on it's own, I'd probably be more lenient.If the movie has anything to offer, not holding it to the same heights and power as ""Silence .."", it would be the funny Hannible one-liners, the make-up for Gary, the entrails that go splat, and Ray at the table at the end of the movie.  I'd have to say it has cult value as a cheezy horror/slasher flick.  But I don't think the makers of this film should get any rewards from this film.The investers in this film must only be planning on people going to see this trash once, because I will NEVER SEE IT AGAIN.  It was a horrible thing to ruin such a powerfull film like ""Silence of the Lambs""!O'ya, one more thing;  I don't think Starling's character is at all the same in this film as it was in the last.

First, I'm not going to compare the movies because many others will and I think movies should be judged on their own merits.That said, I truly enjoyed the movie and believe that it will become more popular over time.  I don't think that it is (immediately) a movie that one falls in love with.  Ridley Scott style is front and center and engulfs the movie in dark shades of blue and black.  Hans Zimmer does a great job setting the tone without getting in the way.The acting, Anthony Hopkins was Anthony Hopkins - a true craftman, Julianne Moore - well this lady is a star (and we truly need more woman who can do a performance like this... bravo).

That's what I missed a lot in Hannibal.Hannibal has more violence on screen, and I don't like that. Some of it disgusted me totally, and that made the movie less scary. I wasn't scared, just disgusted.All in all, Hannibal dissapointed me completely. This was one of my least favourite movies of 2001.",Hannibal

Anthony Hopkins has once again turned in a brilliant performance and Julianne Morris performs well in the shadow of Jodie Foster. The musical score adds to the films atmosphere and the film is worth seeing for the stunning backdrop provided by Florence (surely the perfect setting for Dr Lecter).  I would have considered this film a classic except for the travesty of the last half an hour.  It was always going to be difficult to translate the ending of the book into visual form, both for practical  and reasons of taste.  It seems that the script-writers haven't bothered,  instead we get the gore and none of the explanations or psychological elements that the rest of the story is leading to.  Thomas Harris managed against all odd to produce a book that surpassed what had gone before.  The film with all the positive points it has does not.

The Silence of the Lambs is one of my favourite films and I thought that crew - Anthony Hopkins, Jodie Foster and Jonathan Demme - was perfect.  SPOILER ALERT Well, now I think I was wrong. Julianne Moore made Clarice Starling look sexy and intelligent at the same time. And Ridley Scott made a more fragile Hannibal Lecter, that preferred to cut his hand than try some McGyver skills like open the handcuffs with a knife. Although I missed the suffering eyes of Jodie Foster, Julianne Moore did the right job between the flesh and the brains. An older Anthony Hopkins is also a more sophisticated serial-killer. Together, they made a very close to brilliance thriller.",Hannibal

No plot, minimal character development, questionable motives, poor dialogue, sub-standard acting.  What else can I say?  If you haven't seen it don't bother.  I wouldn't even hire out the video and if you happen to come by it on TV... change the channel.  The only reason anyone might have to see this movie would be to see whether the gratuitous violence lived up to all the hype (which quite frankly is why they added it).  If you want to see some gug eating his own brain, then fast forward to that bit.What was the purpose of this movie?  Its like someone just asked 'I wonder what Hannibal is up to these days' and we just went along for the ride. He is free in the beginning and he's free at the end.  In between is a lot of self-indulgence on the part of Anthony Hopkins and the film makers. Julianne Moore tries valiantly to inject some life into her Clarice, but they gave her a sub-standard script and as far as I'm concerned she was set up to fail.In my opinion this is just a very very bad story in every sense of the word. The only reason it made so much money was because of the senseless violence they added, which at the end of the day leaves you more with a feeling of contempt than the horror you are supposed to feel.I give it a big fat RASPBERRY!",Hannibal
705,casshmoney69,"I liked this movie, but let me warn you it gruesome...",8,26 March 2001,OK this movie was an outstanding film.  It easily out did its previous title Silence of the Lambs.  The beginning was great and the rest was just amazing.  I totally loved it!!  It did have some problems with the story getting a little off in the middle.  But it jumped back towards the ending and had a great last few minutes.  Let me warn you again though that it is THE most gruesome movie I have seen in a long while.

Hannibal was, by far, one of the worst movies to come along in a long time.  The plot was paper thin, the acting mediocre at best, and the movie was full of inaccuracies.

However, when I read the book Hannibal, I started doubting whether a sequel was such a good idea. When seeing Hannibal in the theatre, I understood why Jodie Foster refused to act in the sequel. The change in character between agent Starling in The Silence of The Lambs and Hannibal is just to drastic to be believable, and this breaks the power of the new movie. I was again very impressed by the acting of Anthony Hopkins, though, which clearly saved the movie.",Hannibal
708,bigsexy944,Perhaps people enjoy being negative or perhaps the hype was too high but Hannibal is a winner...,10,24 February 2001,"I have to say with all of the negative comments I've been reading about Hannibal, were they and I watching the same movie??I agree with one comment, the movie ended too quickly and left us with just as big a cliffhanger as Silence of the Lambs did. It sort of summed up too quickly.Aside from that this is one of the BEST movie sequels ever made, while it isn't Silence of the Lambs it's not really supposed to be. People have to realize that this story is told in a different fashion, it may not be as frightning psychologically but it is a suspenseful thriller.
I think the reason many laughed at the gore scenes was because it was the only way to relive their discomfort.The movie was wonderfully written, a decent adaptation from the book but no less enjoyable.Scott has directed another masterpiece, and this movie is a masterpiece. The key to enjoying this movie is not to think of it as Silence of the Lambs.Performances...Liotta: One of his best roles, this guy is an amazingly talented actor. He stole the show, at least in the climax that is! Moore: Not Jodi Foster and while I like Moore she really didn't seem to be Clarice, the movie may have been even better if Foster stared. Hopkins: Just as chilling as in Silence, a great performance. Oldman: This is an Oscar worthy performance and I kid you not, It was the best performance in the movie.The thing about Hannibal is that it needs not to try and have a frightning unworldly twist to it. Silence of the Lambs set that up for us, in this movie we know Hannibal is a monster, we know he's twisted and we know the kinds of things he did, and by now and by some strange force we begin to see him as the protagonist, a twisted hero if you would go that far. We love to hate him and even begin to feel for him, in a world in where you have a faceless child molesting man plotting to feed Hannibal to wild bores, Hannibal doesn't seem all to evil anymore.You have to watch this movie with a twisted sense of appeal to the characters in order to enjoy it. If you stop analyzing it an taking it apart you will see a very good film underneath it all.My advice is, if you watch this movie with a stubborn viewpoint you most likely will be negative, if you open your mind you won't be. This movie is too good to complain about.",Hannibal

Many people went to this movie expecting to see something up to par with Silence of the Lambs. Unfortunately, that is a very high expectation. I, on the other hand, went expecting to see how the film compared to the novel, and I was pleasantly surprised, even though the movie didn't touch upon many of the books riskier details.

For the faint of heart, I have a warning, however: Dear God do NOT see this movie, NO MATTER WHAT!! This is a very gorey movie, and some of it is sick and tasteless. I'd say what, but that would be telling. Anthony Hopkins returns as Hannibal Lector. This is good, because not only is he the perfect Hannibal but the movie probably wouldn't be made without him.

Lecter has been turned into a camp joke, and not a funny one at that, while Julianne Moore as Starling seems to spend most of the movie talking through clenched teeth and giving a simpering look.

From the beginning, I knew who was going to die, who was going to succeed etc. So, I hoped there would be a lot of blood. But... no!

The various media who wrote reviews about this movie lambasted it and called it a ""mainstream hit,"" and similar other types of name-calling.  But a film with the calibre of ""Silence of the Lambs"" cannot be eclipsed by any preceding movie or a sequel.With that being said, being a big fan of ""Silence of the Lambs,"" I thoroughly enjoyed ""Hannibal"" as a film in itself.  Ridley Scott did a tremendous job conveying his own vision onscreen, as always, and is commended with his unique handling of the staple characters of this series. Anthony Hopkins was frightfully entertaining and, as with its predecessor, ""smart"".  His acting is always a pleasure to watch, no matter how much of a role he plays.  Upon seeing his fiery eyes and his maniacal grin, the fascade of Anthony Hopkins being Anthony Hopkins, the Actor, fades away and the reality of Hannibal Lecter settles in.  Julianne Moore handles the role of Clarice Starling quite well and manages to separate herself from Jodie Foster's Academy Award Winning role.  Truly, this collaborative team
If you've been a fan of the book and want an original take on the story of ""Hannibal"", watch this movie.  If you loved ""Silence of the Lambs,"" don't expect this to be an intelligent thriller, as the directors are different.

And why would Clarice try so hard to protect Hannibal?  He is DANGEROUS.  This movie did have some good moments, but the ending disappointed me.  All this movie wanted to accomplish was to try to gross out the audience.  I laughed during some of the gross parts.  It's a movie where you either laugh at the gross parts or just turn your head.

Very well filmed and Hannibal still come off as one very cultured bad ass, but everyone is overreacting on the violence and gore in the film. Gladiator was more bloody!!!  Overall, enjoyable film that follows the first film well but never overcome the legacy of the first.  See it for no other reason than to see Hopkins in the role that he seems destined to play.",Hannibal
722,barrettsmall,Unredeemed nastiness,4,14 November 2001,"Although Mr. Hopkins is on sparkling form, this film has not a whiff of satisfaction about it. It is near impossible to identify with or like any of the characters.It's not the gore (which is pretty well done) that causes this sense of unease and disappointment but the dreary pointlessness of it all. Nothing really happens.",Hannibal
723,saratoo,A Glossy Slasher Flick,5,9 February 2001,This doesn't even come close to the greatness of Silence of the Lambs - this is nothing more than a glossy slasher flick - quite a disappointment!You don't know whether to laugh or vomit at the gratuitous gore that is prevalent in this 'film'.One word of advice - don't plan on keeping your popcorn down if you fully watch the last scene...Wait for it to come out on video...,Hannibal
724,The_Witch,The Not Too Silent Cannibal,10,11 February 2001,"It's not as good as ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" but what is?  What is important is that it's much better than any other movie in a long time.Just like books are considered ""superior"" to movies because the reader uses his/her imagination to a level that a determined vision by a director cannot; a movie like Hannibal can't be ""as good"" as Silence, because in Silence the monster was captured and the gore could be understated (only left to each viewer imagination).  Now, the mental experience must be made graphic and it has to lose power (unseen monsters are always more terrifying than material ones).Given the task at hand, and despite some minor flaws, it's a pretty impressive movie.  There is no good reason to not see it.",Hannibal
725,jraffile,Sequel? I think not.,4,15 February 2001,"The real weakness of this movie, only partially lies in the use of gratuitous violence and the lack of under development of the new characters. The real fault is that the movie seems to have been a sequel to Silence of the Lambs, when in reality the two movies are as different as night and day. Silence of the Lambs is a much better movie for what it is. Every scene in 'silence' is meant to be there, lending itself to the movie as a whole. Hannibal has scenes in which there seems to be no real reason for them. 'Silence' also gets its scare factor from the twisted mind of Hannibal Lector rather then the unecesary violence that 'Hannibal' depends on.All in all, Hannibal would have been a much better movie without Clarice Starling.  This tie to Silence of the Lambs simply over complicates the plot. This, combined with the scare tactics of the screenwriters makes Hannibal a disapointment.",Hannibal
726,doll_face,Sorry - the silence should not have been broken.,3,11 February 2001,"This movie had moments of perfection (Hannibal's interaction with Clarise, Insp. Pazzi), all the way to moments of sheer stupidity (Spoiler alert - feasting on the brains of the DOJ guy).Julianne Moore was splendid replacing Jodie Foster - I truly thought that would not work out and was pleasantly mistaken.  After the first 10 - 15 minutes, it didn't even phase me that the replacement had been made.
I thought the first part of the movie - specifically all of Hannibals actions in Italy - were right on target - classic and fulfilling.  Once Hannibal journeys back to the US, I began to regret forking over the money and standing in line.  I've got to say though - that I am VERY glad they made the revisions to the book plot line - Clarise may have a bizarre, somewhat questionable facination with Hannibal - but she would never ""join"" him - and he would never truly want her to.  ""The world is a more interesting place with you in it, Clarise.""  He meant that.",Hannibal
727,freemz33,"A ""distasteful"" film to say the least.",5,31 August 2001,"Surprisingly accurate to the novel by Thomas Harris.  Hannibal was a big let down.  Dr. Lecter didn't seem as EVIL as in the Silence of the Lambs because he was free.  Free to kill and escape from anywhere.  Starling is played by Juilliana Moore and she just doesn't do the trick.  She isn't as innocent and nieve as Starling played by Jodie Foster.  Granted a decade can change a character, but that's no excuse.  Angent Starling just isn't as likable this time.The end is a major jip.  In the book Hannibal and Starling run off together and get married and live like royalty forever after, going to operas and eating what ever delicacies Lecter craves(not just human flesh we learn). And in the book, Mason Verger's death is much more spectacular(his body building sister uses an electric eel as a weapon on him).  Also a part that explains Lecter's childhood is also missing(Nazis eat his sister).But these things shouldn't have been included anyway if it is still going to be rated R.  However, this movie deserves an NC-17 anyway. Scenes of a man cutting off his face and feeding it to dogs, a man being hanged with his intestines falling out, and two people being devoured alive by huge boars. The violence is the worst in any rated R movie I have ever seen.
It gets a 4 out of 10 from me.",Hannibal
728,Browns930,This movie was sweet!,8,2 March 2001,"If you haven't seen Hannibal, go see it. It is a good movie. It wasn't Silence good, but very good. Anthony Hopkins gives an outstanding performance. Julliane Moore did a great job as Clarice. The other actors did great, too. Warning, if you have a weak stomach, then look away during a few scenes. I was cheering for Hannibal the whole movie. I thought he was the best character.The ten year wait was worth it. The movie gives a combination of action, drama, horror, and comedy (dark comedy) in this movie I gave an 8. I especially noticed how extremely smart this man appeared. He knew everything that was going on.Advice before I finish, if you haven's seen it, see it. If you have see it again. If you listen to me, then goody goody!",Hannibal

Psychologically extremely interesting and i just couldn't put it down. I was extremely curious how they would capture the psychology and suspense in the movie, especially when seeing the media-circus around this movie. It was nice to see the movie, but that is all. Anthony Hopkins is wonderful as always (i laughed my head of when Hannibal said ""okidoki""). But he didn't scare me like he did in SoTL. The constant tension and suspense are gone and the last part of the movie is just horror (in every sense of the word).The book is a must read but the film isn't worth paying a cinema ticket for, but when it comes on television, see it!, after you have read the book of course.",Hannibal
730,FilmCell,A disappointment.,7,16 February 2001,"Hannibal, the sequel to The Silence of the Lambs, is a disappointment. Before I saw Hannibal, I had to of course watch SOTL but also watch Manhunter.  So by watching these two films, it set the expectation level enourmously high, too high for most films.  I went expecting the film to be better than just good, but it ended up being just good.As far as the pace of Hannibal, it's very slow.  I had heard that the film was fast paced but found myself yawning from time to time even if the scene at that point was good.  The pace was steady throughout but too slow.  The first two scenes were great but it went too slow afterwards.  The dialogue is snappy and well done but the script itself seems out of place.
When it comes to acting, you can't say anything bad about these actors.  Of course as usual, Sir Anthony Hopkins turns in a superb performance. Julianne Moore is steady as Clarice and find out that she might have been the only one right for the film.  The character is more physical and it didn't feel like it was a Jodie Foster type role.  I like that Gillian Anderson might have been a little better though.  Giancarlo Giannini also turns in a very good performance.AFTER THIS PARAGRAPH IS A SPOILER WARNING.  I FEEL THAT WITHOUT MENTIONING THESE PLOT POINTS WOULD NOT MAKE THIS REVIEW COMPLETE.  AFTER ALL, I HAVE TO BACK UP MY REVIEW.SPOILER WARNING!!!I think that the carnivorous pigs were humorous.  Too humorous for a film this dark and gritty.  The scenes of Clarice in the basement are a complete waste of the film.  Sure hearing the old tapes of Clarice's and Lector's conversations are interesting, but there isn't much after that.  It's just her listening to tapes and that's it.  They should have had just a few basement scenes.  Basically, Clarice is nothing but a couch potato in these scenes.  Finally, the dinner party scene was pretty good but again, too humorous.  But that scene puts you into a trance.  It is so far out there that it's like wow.  It's like you're feeling like you were on morphine like Clarice was.  It was completely entrancing.SPOILER WARNING OVER.The film was good and that's it.  I was disappointed but it was better than Manhunter.  I think that if you haven't seen SOTL first, you're better off. I think those people will enjoy Hannibal better and then when they watch SOTL, they will say that SOTL is better.  At that point, you can't go back and say that Hannibal was terrible because it's already preset in your mind that it was a great movie.  Hannibal receives a B-.",Hannibal
731,LRWood,So what's the big deal huh??,7,17 February 2001,"Okay I admit I really wanted to see this movie, I read reviews, saw the previews, and heard from others about how gory it was.  I was intrigued and went to the theatre expecting to see something spectacular.  I wasn't completely disappointed, but it wasn't as good as I had hoped it would be.I read the book and I like it.  Book Spoiler** Everyone made a big deal about the ending of the book when Starling runs off with Lecter.  However, I know I am in the minority here, but I like that ending and I would have liked to have seen that in the movie.  The part about this movie that I did really did like was despite the fact that he was a brutal killer you still liked the guy.  I found myself rooting for him.  You get to see the softer side of the man when he takes care of Starling.  It's like a dark and twisted romance and I would have liked to have seen more of it.As far as the gore goes.  Yes there was some and when it happened it was pretty graphic.  But it only happened in a few scenes and it really wasn't all that bad.  In fact during that final dinner party scene I found myself wanting to laugh, I didn't think it was scary at all.Overall, I think it was an alright movie.  It's wasn't the best thing I have seen but it was a good way to spend an afternoon.  I would give this movie a 7 out of 10.",Hannibal

733,MarishkaW,A word in defense of this great film,10,20 February 2001,"From reading preceding critical reviews, I've noticed there are 2 categories of people who did not like this movie. There are those who have unfairly compared it to the first movie, and those who didn't like Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling.The first criticism is an unfair one. Why do you grade a sequel based on its predecessor? Why can't you simply ask yourself the question, ""Was I entertained?"" ""Was the acting superb?"" ""Was the script superb?"" ""Was this thriller thrilling?"" I feel that Hannibal stands alone as a separate movie. Even if you have never seen Silence of the Lambs, there is enough introduction of both characters to bring about an understanding of where they came from and who they are. I was truly on the edge of my seat from the moment the MGM lion roared, and that's the bottom line for me.The second criticism is absolutely laughable. It's obvious that those that make that criticism did not examine Julianne Moore's portrayal objectively. The simply observed that Jodie Foster and Julianne Moore are not the same actress, and that's enough for them to pan Julianne Moore. Actually, if you want to be objective about it, Julianne Moore is BETTER as Clarice Starling. She is more believable, more weak and strong at the same time. Ask yourself this, ""Was Julianne more believable as Clarice?"" Yes. ""Was her acting superb?"" Yes. End of discussion.",Hannibal

Granted the film isn't as juicy as the first, but it definitely still has flavor. Hopkins is as charming as ever, while Julianne Moore adds zeal, and humanity to the part of Starling. One should see the movie for what it is, to be captivated by a character that we all secretly loved. A character that reminds us what we find interesting and charming in the darker, tortured characters. And Hannibal is definitely the darkest of them all. Bon Appetit",Hannibal
735,moviemaestro,Brutal yet sophisticated and elegant,8,9 March 2001,"Not quite what I had expected. Of course with a movie with such a big marketing scheme to promote it, I had seen previews and read comments before I saw Hannibal, yet it made quite a different impression on me than I had anticipated.Were most comments on the movie about its brutality, its nauseating killings and unnecessary violence, I found it to be a very elegant, sophisticated and pleasantly thrilling motion picture. Mind you, Hannibal isn't quite an all family movie; some killings do occur and some people indeed get nauseous while watching them. However the fact that Dr. Hannibal Lecter is a sophisticated chap who appreciates the finer things in life and, as I was told, only eats people who in some way or another deserve it, the movie managed to get me to accept that all the horror wasn't really unbearable.Fine cinematography, beautiful colours and atmosphere, especially in Italy, where Dr. Lecter frolics about in some of Europe's most splendid and picturesque places.Fine story, although I don't think it is as intriguing as its predecessor Silence of the Lambs. Yet good enough to make it very exciting to watch.Fine actors too! Of course we all know that Sir Anthony is a brilliant actor and that he can be as horrific as he can be charming in the skin of Hannibal Lecter. Julianne Moore was surprisingly good as Clarice! It can't be easy to have to equal or top Jodie Foster's fine performance in Silence of the Lambs, and Moore did just that. I have always though of Gary Oldman as quite brilliant, and he was again rather noteworthy, although perhaps somewhat hard to recognise. Let us say he is a man of many faces.All in all I would highly recommend the movie to anyone who's in for a thrill. But be warned that some blood and other things that should normally be on the inside of humans, occasionally come out.Have fun!",Hannibal
736,jimmydotorg,All gore and no story...,4,5 March 2001,"I wasn't as disgusted as some of my friends were with the movie.  However, I was very disappointed.  Anthony Hopkins is too great an actor to waste on a movie that aims to do nothing more than shock the sensibilities of its viewers.  Hannibal is a far cry from the mind-bender it succeeded.Have no regrets if you pass it up.",Hannibal
737,baruku,Regurgitation,3,24 March 2001,"Hannibal, fails in comparison to Silence of the Lambs.The story picks up seven years after the first film.  The notorious Dr Lecter is still on the lam while a disgraced Clarice Starling is still haunted by her experiences with the cannibalistic psychiatrist.A new character is introduced in this entry - Mason Verger is the only surviving victim of Lecter. Mutilated,crippled and unbelievably rich, he hunts Lecter down, relishing the day when he will have his revenge.This rundown is undoubtedly promising and make no mistake it could have been a great film, certainly on par with 'lambs', but the way the director literalises Thomas Harris' fourth novel is dreadfully unimaginative and utterly repellent.Gone is the distinctive black humour of Harris' characters, Hopkins' as Hannibal blurts out the cannibal puns with such a wearisome monotony that it wears out its welcome soon after he first appears.  Verger was a complex and serpentine character with an implicit attraction to his lesbian sister (she is cut out of the film) in the book, in the film he is a one dimensional villain, devoid of any flesh - both literally and metaphorically.  Gary Oldman does well with what he is handed.  Moore stepping into the shoes immortalised by Jodie Foster is dealt the worst blow.  She is an incredible performer and the character of Clarice needed to go through a catharsis of sorts, im not opposed to a new actress in the role - she is just given nothing to do but run around and look erotic but hardened at the same time.The main quibble that I had with Hannibal was nothing to do with the performers or the fact that the first film was going to be difficult to live up to it is the sledgehammer mentality with which director Ridley Scott enacts the story.  This is the man sci-fi buffs hail as the master after 'Alien'.  In this film he relied on darkness, spiralling corridors and the infinity of space to act as a method of scaring the audience.  Maybe he doesnt have the same items to work with, but surely he could assert some subtlety.I have no problem with violence but he seemed to go on and on with it, the more garrish and horrifying the more he wallowed in it.  This was an inane move and ultimately it softened the impact.Hannibal is a different film lets get that straight, Jonathon Demme showed restraint in the first film, choosing to minimalise the violence somewhat. I see absolutely no reason why Scott had to go back and retread certain scenes in the first film that Demme chose to leave to our imaginations. Not only does it demonstrate his utter lack of vision, but it appropriates the enduring image of 'Lambs'.  This treads the fine line between art and plain vandalism.The beauty of 'Lambs' was the ambiguity in the relationship between the two principles.  I see no reason why it has to be so defined in this film, although it is worse in the book.  In any case it serves as yet another shock tactic that fails miserably.Overall the film has definite moments, but rather than the scenes of sheer overkill, I will remember Hannibal as the film that could have been but never was!",Hannibal

Was there not blood, guts and gore if you will pardon my explicit wording. It is a movie about a cannibalism for goodness sake. People have said Silence was much better than Hannibal. Not so. It is a extension from the first movie. And very well done I might add. Please go see Hannibal again. Compare the two with a more open mind. I know most sequels are not usually the best but this one is defintely one of the best. As I said the most complaints that I read dealt more with too much gore, blood and guts. Again remember SOTL.

741,Doemlling,"A Magnificent Film, On An Epic Level",10,4 May 2001,"Hannibal is probably the most underrated sequels I have ever seen.  The reason being is that everyone expected to see a sequel, when all they really saw in this film was a movie that was totally unique and stand on its own. I think many of the people who saw this movie and didn't like it, were simply disappointed by their own shallow sense of expectation.  This time round it is Hannibal's film, and that being said, of course it is going to be much darker than the first two films, which were essentially great crime thrillers.  But Hannibal is more of a drama and character study into the mind of a man, a witty cultured, romantic, sophistocated man, who just happens to be a homicidal sociopath, and his obsession and love for a woman(Clarice) who admires and respects him, but can never return the love he feels for her.  I was also surprised by the epic feel the movie carried with it as well, almost on a very grand scale.  I guess you make an epic film with any any type of subject matter, you don't need it to take place over a long period of time, or have it be about some great historical leader, or even include a war or a famous sinking ship, as long as you have the right script(intriguing and original storyline), the right actors(the acting all around was first rate), and excellent directing(kudos to Ridley Scott who gives an epic feel to all his movies).

It follows the horror guidelines of a sequel in elevating the danger and the gore.  Boy, does it elevate the gore.  But the great thing about this film is the developments in the relationship between Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling.  Julianne Moore has big shoes to fill.  While she doesn't wear them quite as well as Jodie Foster did, she fits in them okay.  It's not too big a problem, as Clarice isn't even the same person anyway.  She's more hardened and seasoned, not the rookie she was in ""Lambs"".  Hopkins is great, of course. Ridley Scott does a good job of continuing the story.  He won't get the same raves he did for ""Gladiator,"" but that's okay, it's still a good movie.  No award-worthiness, but an entertaining, interesting, and often sickening movie.

745,madtom-1,HANNIBAL is the ultimate in serial killer films...,10,1 October 2006,"People compare ""Hannibal"" to ""Silence Of The Lambs"" which, if they want to play that game, is better than SOTL. Director Ridley Scott (Alien, Bladerunner, 1492: Conquest Of Paradise) is at the director's seat in this stylish, visceral and shocking live action painting of a horror film. This movie takes place almost a decade later from SOTL. Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore), once famed but now discredited by the FBI gets contacted by a weary, yet refined Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). She trails after him to Florence, a stylish and archaic city full of recorded history from containing some the world's most famed writers and artists.Starling is not the only person that is hunting Lecter. Apparently, a deranged and wealthy lunatic, that survived Hannibals attacks, wants vengeance in the most deranged way no sane or insane man can ever think of. There is a crooked police officer, with an unwanted history of his own, that trails after Lecter as well and uses and abuses people to get to him for his own lusts and greed. A unique pattern develops here which I found particularly interesting and controversial- a theme that I and others believe cost ""Hannibal"" from getting any Academy Award nominations. You see, all of the noticeable Hannibal stalkers, with the exception of Clarice, are rotten and evil to the core. This makes Hannibal, an ""anti hero""- evil for evil. That is one of the reasons why I believe ""Hannibal"" got no Academy Award nominations, which I vastly disagree with, in my outspoken opinion . The technicals such as lighting, camera, sound, editing and special/ visual effects are all intricately weaved in stark detail and are all ""top score"". The original score is well spun also and fabulously composed. The directing and writing is above and beyond description. Ridley Scott, in some wave lengths, crosses artistic lines with Stanley Kubrick. Scott's style of directing, is far beyond measure as he is a natural born artist- it shows in fantastic fashion. I'm an artist/ painter as well, since I was age seven. So, I know artistic genuine quality, detail and integrity when I see it- and Scott ""is it"". The violence in this film is, to say the least, visceral and extreme. It is well directed, crafted and executed by Scott. It is 100% realistic and the continuity is 100% applicable, possible and on target. We see Hannibal, not as a one dimensional human eating machine in SOTL, but a ""three dimensional"" killer that has other interests and agendas. This is excellent because the writers make Dr. Lecter out to be a well refined, structured, focused and ""well seasoned"" man of high intelligence, strength and dexterity. This film is not for the faint hearted and simple minded thinkers. You would have to watch this film more than once to understand the detailed concepts. ""Hannibal"" weaves a detailed web of the Macabre, a type of horror style that originated from such writers Edgar Allan Poe and HP Lovecraft. It also creates a ""busy live action painting"" of betrayal, dark humor, extreme violence, sadism, opera, forbidden affection and intelligence. Just when the viewers think they have seen it all, the film takes the stunned viewer to the ""vomitorium"" in the third act. That said and in one scene, in the ""vomitorium"", made audiences groan and 'reacte'. I'll never forget that segment and that moment.""Hannibal"" got no Academy Award nominations which, in fact, contradicts everything they stand for. You see, the Academy Awards always talked about how they want and like ""realistic"" and ""plausible"" motion pictures about ordinary or conventional 'people, places or things'. Well, ""Hannibal"" has a significant amount of those qualities and qualifications, but it didn't get nominated anyways. This has made me very disappointed in them. There is no excuse for that. None. Their decision to cross ""Hannibal"" off the list of getting Oscar knods was merely, in my opinion, 'clear politics' and I haven't watched the Oscars since. The film should have got, at least, 4 following nominations: (1): Best Actor (Anthony Hopkins), (2) Best Screenplay, (3) Best Director, (4) Best Original Score.""Hannibal"" is a revolutionary horror film- a trend setter. Many people were majorly or minorly disturbed by the film and that is another key factor I respect about the movie. It put a ""marker"" in peoples minds. The film is controversial for touching issues that people don't want to talk about or too afraid to face. The films brings it up from the deep confines of either denial or unawareness. The film is intensily realistic and a masterpiece of monumental proportions...Five stars out of five.Tom Millan ""Indie Filmmaker""",Hannibal
746,steve007steve,"Hannibal Lector, M.D. --HERO?",8,5 September 2001,"To start with, Hannibal is an exceptional film. As for those who say, ""Its no Silence of the Lambs"", they are right. Silence of the Lambs was an Academy Award winning Best Picture. Can you name any other Best Pictures to garner a sequel? Didn't think so. No its not Silence, its different, its darker, its better.With that said, lets start with the good (Vices the bad, because the movie isn't perfect). Sir Anthony Hopkins is once again brilliant as Hannibal. Oscar worthy? Definatly. Julianne Moore is a more sexy, smarter Clarice, a nice change. (Though not to take away from Jodie Fosters excellent turn at her). The direction is amazing, Ridley Scott can take on Cannibals, Gladiators, Aliens, and Thelma & Louise, and make them all destined classics.Now for the gripes. The novel Hannibal, by Thomas Harris is one of my favorite all time reads (I rank the novel right at the top along with almost anything by the great Dean Koontz). The ending in the movie was changed from the book. The DVD presents Hannibal with two quite different endings (both 100% different from the book). I almost hated the ending shown at cinemas. As we watch Hannibal we look at him as the hero. Maddenly Brilliant. He's better matched along side Indiana Jones than Charles Manson. Keeping that in mind we want Hannibal to, Firstly get the girl, secondly to escape plight with no injury, and thirdly we want those who want to hurt him to pay. The movie, following its climax, gives us this and more.....minus the first two points. (incidently the book gives us all three).So, for all you true Hannibal fans out there, I recommend the following: Read the novel first. Watch the film (at night with all lights out of course) and if you have the DVD, check out the alternative ending (Its gives us all points except the first...a little better).",Hannibal

What's more annoying is that the screenplay was co-written by David Mamet, one of the best writers in the business. I can't be assed with all this spoiler pedantic nonsense so if you haven't seen the film or read the script go and put the kettle on.Hannibal has been traced to Uffizzi Galleria in Florence by a local corrupt cop Pazzi. Outside waiting to bundle him into a truck and into the fiendish hands of Gary Oldman are Pazzi's own two professional henchmen. Pazzi is killed in a historical yet ironic fashion, which prompts said henchmen to rush into the Galleria, whereupon Hannibal slices and dices Hairy Henchman #1 with his usual panache. Henchman #2 (bald) trips over the body and has a nano second of screen time as he grieves for Hairy Henchman #1, with whom he obviously has a closer relationship than baddy buddies. wink, winkFlash forward and yet again we find Hannibal trapped and cornered by nemesis Oldman and assorted Italian Henchmen. But wait, who is this familiar henchman amongst them? Why, it's our old bald baddy buddy from the Galleria who has had no previous connection with the Oldman gang. Needless to say, Hannibal goes on the old bite and flight routine, yet manages to throw in a quip to bald henchman about him wearing same disgusting after shave as his dead brudder, before garrotting him with his usual culinary panache.Now there's nothing to indicate that the bald buddy baddie has fallen in with the Oldman gang, yet he manages to make the flight from Florence to Washington, hook up with the Oldman gang, and nobody stops to ask, 'Who's the bald geezer?' Now, obviously I am pedantic in the way I watch films. It's been a long time since I was able to willingly suspend my disbelief, but this jarred out as a sore thumb to me. My best friend Jimmy, not the most dedicated of cineastes, also spotted the flaw, with the immortal phrase ""When did HE join the man eating pig gang?"" So it can't just be me and my pal, which begs the question what the chuffing fudge was going on with the studio, the writers, the script editor, the continuity girl/bloke and the director that no one thought, ""Oops, that doesn't quite play right. Should we go back and fix it?""Otherwise, it's a brilliant movie. It's in all-time favorite top three. I just wish they kept the part about Hannibal's sister. It explains a lot about him and the way he connected with Clarice. My advice: read the book, then watch the movie. I like the movie ending a lot better than the book. It agrees with the characters and makes more sense. For the uninitiated this review probably doesn't make much sense, so I suggest you go read the book, watch the movie and come back and reread it.

I wasespecially excited to see the film because of Julianne Moore, who is pure theatrical genius.It wasn't necessarily better than Silence, but so much different that it stood on it's own. Tony Hopkins was wonderful as usual, and Julianne portrayed Starling with a tough edge and a soft, tormented center.Excellent film, and the DVD is even better.",Hannibal

One of my main problems was the new actress playing Agent Starling, after Jodie Fosters excellent performance in Silence of the Lambs. But Julianne Moore can not keep the country accent of starling for even a sentence i would of preferred it if she didn't try and use the accent in stead of making a fool out off her self for using it. On a nicer note Antony Hopkins it very good again as Hannibal Lecter and the rest of the cast (except Ray Liotta who really should stick to films about gangs and the mafia) are strong and believable.On whole the story line is strong but no were near as disturbing as Silence of the Lambs. After saying all of this the film is just about watch able ever with Julianne Moore instead of Jodie Foster.

He was just as creepy and amusing in this movie.You may also think that nobody could play Clarice Starling like Jodie Foster and you would be right Julianne Moore was...much less annoying and in other words quite great.Mason Verger played by Gary Oldman was sick and twisted which is a really good thing. His face was discusting (lit my fire).You must see this film it is well put together and the acting is great, i didn't think it was very gruesome but that maybe because I am quite disturbed.

754,CrowMinuteman,the fear of crazy people,1,29 March 2010,"Having worked for a number of years with acutely psychotic patients and the criminally insane I get the deepest belly laughs over the way Hollywood portrays ""psychotic"" criminals and the horror and revulsion the movie watching public drums up when they see Hannibal Lecter. I didn't like either Hannibal movie, but this one was particularly stupid. I can't believe Anthony Hopkins allowed himself to be conned into repeating that character performance. Julianne Moore made a big mistake also. She definitely lowered herself doubling for a main character in a ""sequel"" (Jody Foster). She's far too good for that. And, what was Ray Liota thinking?! To get back to the psychotic thing, Hannibal's aggression, quickness, strength, agility and handiness with sharp objects resembles an evil comic book superhero, not a crazed psychiatrist or an insatiable cannibal. Even less credible is the conduct of his victims. They are easier to kill and put up less fight than a 3,000 year old mummy. It is pure BS that only the movie going public could keep from laughing at. All I can say is that its a good thing Rocky Balboa never had to get in the ring with Hannibal Lecter! I couldn't bear watching Hannibal making coleslaw outta Rocky! Actually, the movie wasn't terribly bad until the RSHE, that is the RidiculouslyStupid Hollywood Ending. RSHE is common in most Hollywood products and this one was no exception. To be fair, Hannibal ended pretty stupid, but I've seen stupider.",Hannibal

Especially Anthony Hopkins.The film is unpredictable and engaging all the way through.

A man who is greatly feared even when incarcerated in a dungeon cell of an old prison for the ""insane"". In this movie, he's more human who is out and about and gets caught by inferior sub-humans who dwell in the mud of the wild boars they keep captive.Also, if you didn't know ahead of time that Gary Oldman is in this movie, you'd never realize it when watching.Everyone knows that sequels are nothing but cash grabs and this one is no different.

759,pertiapurl,"If you read the book, you'll be very disappointed",5,10 September 2005,"It isn't that the film is terrible. Really, it isn't. If you wanted a horror film where the hunt for a wicked genius became all-encompassing and twisted every notion of who's wearing the white hats, rock on. Rent and enjoy. Sure, there's some of the typical sequences where the outcome is obvious to anyone who's ever seen a few formulaic horror films. However, there are also several genuine shocks and twists (such as your first look at Mason's face)that will catapult your pulse right on up into stroke range. That being said, this film ain't really an adaptation of the book by the same name written by Thomas Harris. This film took highlights from the book, basic character sketches, wove several scenes from Hollywood whole cloth and ran the whole mess through a blender to pour out a mass-appeal, watered-down, high adrenaline final product. If you had seen this in theaters, the discrepancy was painfully obvious. As the last scene faded to black and credits rolled, those film goers who'd just come to see the latest horror flick were definitely very happy with what they'd just taken in; those who'd come to see Harris' latest Lecter installment brought to life were rather vocal in their disgust with Hollywood's treatment of Hannibal. Depending on which group you belong to, I can either highly recommend this horror film or tell you to go ahead if you're really heart-set on it but go warily.",Hannibal
760,RMHolt77,The Best of the Lecter Trilogy,8,5 November 2005,"In many circles today, it's almost heresy to dare to claim that Ridley Scott's HANNIBAL is anything but inferior to SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. I've always disagreed. Ridley Scott's HANNIBAL is by far the most unique and grand of the Lecter films, becoming a superb work that combines Grand Guignol with a beauty-and-the-beast storyline.What this film truly is is a very different kind of sequel, like BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN was to FRANKENSTEIN. This film has no intention of really imitating its predecessor - but rather to go in a whole other direction and along the way chuckle a bit at the success of its predecessor.Ridley Scott's direction is at the top of his game here. The movie flows with an elegance that is perfectly fitting the central figure, Hannibal, and his lifestyle. The cinematography is beautiful, and Hans Zimmer's score is lyric and gripping.Anthony Hopkins returns to recreate the role he made famous in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, and is, of course, phenomenal. In this film we see Hannibal Lecter's romantic side, and by all means, Hopkins does a terrific job with it. This is really Hannibal's film all the way, and he's not afraid to take center stage.Julianne Moore, playing the role of Clarice Starling, does a serviceable job. Her performance is by no means as epic as Jodie Foster, but in a sense, Moore seems more fitting to the film than Foster would have. The rest of the cast is fairly well rounded out with veteran actors, and all do a fine job.The single best moment in the film is Clarice and Lecter's last moment together - both are at their best. It's extremely romantic, and it works. It really works. While the ending author Thomas Harris gave it would have been more darkly appropriate, the ending Scott has given it definitely doesn't disappoint and nicely resolves on the theme of ""impossible romance"" that he sought to give the film.",Hannibal

It has it's own individuality, it is not supposed to be like ""Lambs"", so, it's quality should not be judged based on similarity/continuity with ""Lambs"".I especially enjoy sound & atmosphere in this movie. Also, I like Julian Moore more then Jodie Foster.",Hannibal
762,jules_winfield94,A Classic film. Highly underrated and superior to SOTL,8,21 March 2005,"Right here we have a sequel (or installment) that actually rises above it's predecessors. It sits atop a very short list of worthy follow ups, right along side Godfather Part II, Aliens, T2 and Spiderman 2. Now in no way does this mean that Manhunter and Silence of the Lambs aren't good films, they certainly are. Manhunter is one of the best police procederals/80's flicks ever and Lambs is an excellent Gothic horror film. I myself just feel that Hannibal is one of the best films in recent years and far superior to the film which spawned it. Hannibal is a brilliant film. Like it's subject of examination it is both charming and violent. It has such moments of cinematic grandeur and style that you can barely describe it. It is an odd sort of beauty, quite brooding and melancholy, but beautiful none the less.Performances are fine all around. Hopkins is still menacing, but in a more restrained manner. He exudes more sophistication and grace this time around. He is far less campy than he is in SOTL. Julianne Moore take on Starling shows a far stronger character than Jodie's. Moore really nails the evolution of this character from naive trainee to maverick agent. The supporting performances are also very nice particularly from Ray Liotta (who has the movie's best death scene) as king of all slime balls Justice Derpartement Rep Paul Krendler and Gary Oldman as the film's ravenous and deformed villain Mason Verger. Although completely unrecognizable under pounds of prosthetics and makeup Oldman elegantly oozes perversion and sadism. adding another notch to his repertoire of unforgettable villains. I can't understand why critics and audiences were so taken aback by this movie. The film has been trashed to no end for it's gore, but therein lies much of the movie's appeal: How it handles it's violence. It's like the paintings of Francis Bacon, which I are quite relished and enjoyed by Doctor Lecter. You want to look away, but you can't, the movie has you in it's grip. There are three particularly violent but thoroughly awe inspiring scenes that make you marvel at the level of skill and technique Ridley Scott employs in all of his films. The scenes are those of the Fish Market shoot-out, the Lecter/Pazzi confrontation in the Capponi library, the bore massacre and the dinner scene. All are hard to take in on account of there intense and somewhat sadistic depictions of gore and violence, but they are still quite amazing to behold. This is on account of the movies atmosphere which is abstract and wild. The film has so many styles and moods and methods of storytelling, ranging from tongue in cheek humor, to solemn romance, to medieval carnage and mayhem. Watching it I feel an odd sense of peace within me, like I am being carried away by a great symphony, or a sonnet. Sure the images and ideas are often gruesome and off-putting (for anyone but me that is) but they resonate in my heart long after the movie is over. It's a like the strangest of dreams. The kind of dream that disturbs, yet moves you. People criticize it for being over the top, weird, gruesome and well... silly. I agree with them, that this movie is weird and gruesome, but hey, whats wrong with that? They also say that it strayed too far from 'Lambs'. Again I ask what's wrong with that? When it comes to sequels why must we expect the same thing over again? Re-hashing old ideas is far from exciting. I don't know exactly what everyone was expecting from this movie, but for me it lived up to it's hype. I for one think this movie is worthy of as much praise or more praise than 'Lambs'. It's brave, it's bold, it's macabre, it's sensual, it's funny, it's sad, it's tragic, it's romantic, it's poetic. Simply put, it's a classic. For me it's right up there with 'A Clockwork Orange'. Terribly underrated. It should have swept the Oscars or at least got more attention, other than for being the highest grossing R rated movie up until that time. Ridley Scott has a chunk of good films worthy of Oscars for his direction (Blade Runner, Legend, Gladiator, Black Hawk Down), this is no exception. Hannibal is a classic through and through. 10 out of 10 for me.",Hannibal
763,tricky_jgc,The best one of Hannibal Lecter's films,10,20 June 2005,"Hannibal Lecter is a fascinating character, he's not the typical mass murderer or a regular psycho. No, he's a refined intellectual, a genius, a classy and seductive gentleman and on top of that, a violent killer who also happens to eat his victims, or somehow toy with them. His particular nature is more reflected in Hannibal than in any of the other related films (Manhunter -Michael Mann, 1986; The Silence of the Lambs -Jonathan Demme, 1991; Red Dragon -Brett Ratner's remake of Manhunter, 2002). For example when he lives in Florence and becomes a curator of a well-known museum, or when he goes to the Opera, or when he provides Dante Allighieri's references to inspector Rinaldo Pazzi; or when he sends a subtle note (with a beautiful drawing attached) to Clarice (brilliantly played by Julianne Moore, better than Jodie Foster, in my opinion) with an exclusive fragrance in it; the things he says, the things he does,the things he eats, the music, the shots of Florence (specially the ones with the pigeons in the main square or when the hit-man chases him) his brutality towards Mason Verger, Rinaldo Pazzi and Paul Krendler. To sum up, Ridley Scott was extraordinarily accurate on depicting Lecter's essence on this picture.Same thing about Clarice, only that she's a troubled mind as far as her identity, her job (the complex relationship with her sexist co-workers and with the CIA itself), with her past and with her life in general, makes her a more complex character than the Foster's one. When this two beautifully written and directed characters converge, you get an extraordinary experience, where Mason Verger, the giant hogs, Florence, Krendler (and his roll at what turns out to be one of the wickedest romantic dinners in movie history, for sure) and whatnot, can't be left in second term when viewing and reviewing this film.The ending it's remarkable. Lecter's choice clearly states that there's a human behind the beast, with weaknesses and feelings.",Hannibal

Hannibal is nothing like The Silence of the Lambs at all. It starts of slow, the actress who played Sterling is different and not very deserving of this role. It takes about forty minutes for blood shed to ensue, until then it's just lots of running around trying to find Hannibal Lecter. I only continued to watch this movie, because Anthony Hopkins makes a great Hannibal. He's calm and collected which is unusual for a serial killer. The plot was shoddy and it was a bunch of fluff in the film, until finally in the end Hannibal the Cannibal finally became himself.

The entire story line runs like this, starting with SOTL, then a sequel, then a prequel, followed by another prequel. Silence was certainly a good place to start. That's a good movie which I gave 8/10. I feel a movie has to be an absolute masterpiece to score 10. Hannibal was an OK movie. It feels like a cash grab a little bit. The plot is a little...meh. It has more gore than suspense this time around. I will say (without spoilers) it has one or two delightfully original set pieces.Anthony Hopkins is as good as always. Not so good that I would call him Sir, but very good. Julianne Moore was just OK. She has been better in other movies. She plays the role of Clarice Starling, previously played by Jodie Foster.

The deviation from the author's conceptualization as contained in the book was egregious. However, it was interesting to see a visual representation of many of the themes contained in the book.

778,ladyljd,Deserving of Respect,8,26 October 2003,"*** SPOILER WARNING ***After reading so many negative comments about this film I felt compelled to respond. Perhaps having read Harris' book is a huge advantage, but I found it easy to accept this film as a continuation of the original.  In it we see the natural evolution of the main characters.HANNIBAL takes place 10 years after SILENCE OF THE LAMBS (SOTL).  Things have changed for both Lecter and Starling.  Lecter is free of the asylum while Starling has had 10 years of FBI service under her belt.  This would make her a very different character from the young rookie we met in the first film.  And, for me, it made the casting of Julianne Moore easily acceptable.  She brings a sense of jaded maturity to Clarice that I found highly appropriate.  Her performance hits all the right notes.  In fact, her decision to take this role grows more courageous over time.
And Hopkins' Lecter is just as compelling this time around.  I found watching his transition from semi-retirement to terrible violence amazing to watch.  The character still exudes power and magnetism at both behavioral extremes.  I was so caught up in the ease with which Lecter flowed from scene to scene that I was truly jarred by the climactic dinner scene.  For me, this was a pleasant shock and surprise.  Sir Anthony gives a truly amazing performance.The simple fact that HANNIBAL is not limited to the dungeons and basements of SOTL should provide a clue to its uniqueness.  Director Ridley Scott imbues this film with an operatic feel.  The lush cinematography is amazing, as is the soundtrack.  SOTL was a brilliant thriller, a crime story. HANNIBAL is a tragedy - yes, even a romantic tragedy.  In that sense, prepare yourself for difference in order to truly appreciate this film.

The lady in front of me threw up on herself she was so repulsed.  Weak stomachs be warned.Great movie -- Great ending....  will there ever be ""Starling -- The Silence, Part 3""?",Hannibal
780,Vega74,satisfying and disappointing,7,9 February 2001,"Visually, this film was beautiful. You can tell that Ridley Scott was involved. I think the first 3/4 of the film was quite convincing, however, the last segment was weak. It's intensely frustrating that they excluded vital material from Harris' novel, the ending in particular.As usual, Hopkins was fantastic",Hannibal
781,Fienddom,What crap,3,12 February 2001,"This movie is not worth seeing.  If you are a fan of Silence, don't bother seeing the sequel, it will only disappoint you.  Moore is good, but she's not Foster.  Hopkins, of course, does a great job as Hannibal, but the problem here is not the acting.  Likewise, Scott as director does a good job.  Again, this is not the issue.  The issue here is the problems with the movie itself.  Its a disappointment.  Moreso than the book.I rate it a 3.  Most of that is for Hopkins.",Hannibal
782,DECKARD-50,very disappointing,3,11 February 2001,"Well, take out Ray Liotta, Julianna Moore, make it about the Italian cop versus Lector, then take out the completely morally offensive final scene with the child, you mightta had a good movie.  As it is, just a long drawn out schlock horror movie with a lead actor with a genuine British accent. Stay home and watch Manhunter and Silence of the Lambs.  P.S. The makeup for Gary Oldman has the early lead for Best Makeup.  Man, was that totally &$(#@&# up.",Hannibal
783,Crit eye,An explosion of gross stupidity,1,27 March 2001,"I must say that a sequel is always a sequel ... but this time I gave Hannibal a chance and went to watch it, owing to the fact that I loved Silence of the Lambs. I think that the film is very slow at the beginning with regards to momentum. Not so much as a negative criticism since the director might have probably wanted us to get to know the characters and the lot. The thing is that at the very end instead of reaching a decent climax, the film and its theme exploded into gross and stupid medical operation. In other words I expected  better of Hannibal !!!",Hannibal
784,thebear-4,"You will never say ""Eat Your Heart Out"" in quite the same way ever again!",7,9 February 2001,Super symmetry in particle physics notes that for every particle there is its mirror opposite.

785,Lucifer-28,"Hmmmm....oh boy.....ummm, yeah.......",5,10 February 2001,"Geez.....where to begin? Well, let me start off by saying that the actors all did a fine job, and the production values were flawless. Every scene was beautiful (well, you know, 'cept for the last 10 minutes. But that's no fault in shooting...). Seeing Hopkins reprise his role as Lector was fabulous; I had been waiting for that ever since I saw Silence of the Lambs. And I was pleasently surprised to see Julianne Moore give a good performance as Clarice Starling (even though Jodie Foster's will be the classic, but it isn't easy following up an Oscar winning actress; especially when said Oscar was earned for that very role). However, the script contained MANY problems. First and foremost is the exclusion of two characters very central to the story of ""Hannibal."" First is Mason Verger's sister. The second was Jack Crawford (even if Scott Glen didn't return....well, they replaced Foster...). Why these two integral characters were left out is a complete mystery to me. The second problem was that much of the movie felt too rushed. The first hour and 15 minutes or so went at a nice pace, very close to that of the book. The rest of the movie however.....scenes were deleted, compacted, or combined so that we could get to the ending quicker. In my opinion, this threw the stride of the movie completely off balance for the rest of the film. Last, but most DEFINIATELY not least, was the way that the ending was so drastically altered from that in the book. This is what really bothered me the most. I cannot express how upset I was to see this. The original ending was much better, and more creative as well. There was no good reason to rewrite it like that.All in all, it was a decent movie, but it did not come close to living up to my expectations.",Hannibal
786,hilton.travis,"I expected a lot, it delivered a bit.",5,11 March 2001,"I am a huge fan of Silence of the Lambs.  Has to be in my top 5 movies of all time.  After seeing this, I bought the books for both Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs and read them both.  As soon as Hannibal was published, I bought it and read it too.  That left me expecting an awesome movie.With Ridley Scott directing (Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator) I expected to see an excellent film.  With Anthony Hopkins again starring as Hannibal, I expected to see an excellent film.Well, I was disappointed.  Not entirely, mind you, but to a large enough degree to write this comment.The camera work was good, the acting was OK, but nothing like the Silence of the Lambs - Anthony Hopkins was good, Julianne, well she is no Jodie Foster (in this role).  In general the film followed the book - and that is a good thing - the book is excellent.However, the ending of the film was a bit... lame?  I did like the ""Master's Apprentice"" style of the ending, but there was a lot of chemistry between Hannibal and Clarice that was left out just before this.  Thomas Harris, in his book, develops the Lecter/Starling a lot further, and I feel cheated that this was not in the movie.I must admit that it was interesting to see the number of people that left the cinema when ""that"" scene was shown - some I would not have expected! However, the film as a whole could have been a bit ""tighter"" if the Lecter/Starling relationship was explored a bit more - as in the Silence of the Lambs.Oh well, not a complete waste at least.  Hannibal is still Hannibal.",Hannibal
787,dannykparker,A bit of a let down,4,5 March 2001,"The film starts well, Ridley Scott on reasonable form, but then Julianne Moore opens her mouth and this rediculous accent comes out, its allmost comical, if it wasn't so sad. The plot tumbles on, very stylishly, and a little slowly, but it all appears to be leading to a big finale and... well... I wouldn't use the word big (If you catch my drift). Anthony Hopkins seems to ditch the hannibal from 'Silence of the lambs' and creates a completely different character. The film has bags of style, but none of the gritty nastiness of its prequel. The ending is a joke, quite literally. Dissapointing, very dissapointing.",Hannibal
788,RecoveringXian,Another self-mutilating sequel . . .,3,12 February 2001,"""Hannibal"" will undoubtedly be compared with its predecessor, ""Silence of the Lambs.""  It will also be compared on three tiers, the replacements of Jonathan Demme and Jodie Foster, the over-the-top gore of the film, and the nature of the bizarre plot itself.  Let's begin.  Jodie Foster made us care about Agent Starling.  We gave a damn.  She was focused, yet vulnerable. Julianne Moore is competent, yet vastly inferior to Foster in every respect. Granted, Starling is a much more sexual creature this go round, but Foster was infinitely more believable as the girl with a ""good bag and cheap shoes.""  Ridley Scott has made a spectacle of epic proportions once again. However, this spectacle is an epic mistake.  What made ""The Silence of the Lambs"" so terrifying?  Subtlety.  We were frightened because much was left to the imagination.  Also, the film really seemed to be a study of serial killer behavior and was very accurate in that detail.  ""Hannibal"" falls short in this respect because it is hard to believe that Hannibal Lecter would behave in the fashion he does in the film.  Really, it holds up until the now-infamous ""final 10 minutes"" that have been so extensively written about.  The gore is mostly unnecessary and seemed to be placed in the film to broaden its appeal to blood-thirsty teenyboppers who aren't often drawn to deep, complex plots.  Lecter should never have been this over-the-top. It's insulting to the character.  Although Hopkins reprises his role well, he really was not dealt the full hand that the first screenplay allowed him. The first film belongs in the thriller section; this rubbish belongs in the comedies.  It's just a bunch of campy horror schtick with little or no redeeming qualities.  I was expecting so much more.  The final product is just another failed sequel.",Hannibal
789,jochems,Different...,8,6 April 2001,"Hannibal Lecter is enjoying his life in Rome. For an intellectual as he is it the place to be. Beautiful architecture, impressive opera's and lot's of possibility's for a good meal. Clarence Sterling is facing the other side of the medal also. During a catastrofal shoot-out she kills 5 people. She loses her badge and her good name. Mason Verger is the third person. He is the only victim of Lecter who's still alive. His face tells you that he did not had an pleasant encounter with Hanibal. His obsession for vengeance brings Hannibal and Clarence back together. The film is visual almost perfect. No Suprise because Ridley Scot has been directing this movie. Beautiful scenery in Rome and Sicily. Julliane Moore is great as Clarence Sterling. Charming and very, very sexy. The film has an ironic tone with some gruesome graphical details. Hanibal has class and style. A complete other movie than his predecessor. But that doesn't make it a bad movie. On the contrary. The Silence has been broken...",Hannibal
790,vinah,A horrible sequel to a brilliant movie,1,25 February 2001,"If you loved Silence of the Lambs for its intelligent thrilling qualities than DO NOT WATCH its sequel.  Silence's Lecter was frightening because his brillance was the focus of the movie, not the details of his gory means of dispatching people.  He was refreshingly different because he was not an atypical slasher. Hannibal's Lecter on the other hand is shown in all his gory details.  He is free from his cell and stalks and slashes like any other b-movie horror villain.  He appears and disappears at will without explanation.Another key draw for Silence was Foster's charisma which underlined the audience's connection with her.  Moore's Starling illicits no emotion from the audience.  Credit to a plausible accent, aside from that Moore portrays a character that we as an audience really do not care for and in the end we really don't care about her relationship with Lecter.
This movie is also incredibly boring and slow.   Any type of tension is drawn out as we wait and wait and wait to see what Hannibal does next. It's as if the filmmakers wanted to waste our lives for an extra 45 minutes.",Hannibal
791,ClkwrkOr97-3,"Excellent performances barely save troubled ""Hannibal""",7,12 February 2001,"""Hannibal"" is probably the most anticipated sequel since ""The Phantom Menace""; like the latter, all that build-up can do nothing to prevent some disappointment.  Director Ridley Scott has cast a film of his own vein--rich, operatic, laced with dark humor, and baring little resemblance to the eye of Jonathan Demme, director of the first film.  That fact alone squelches most notions of comparison, and encourages the viewer to just sit back and enjoy the current rants and rampages of Dr. Hannibal Lector (played brililantly by Hopkins as older, more subdued, but never less threatening).As for the bally-hoo surrounding Julianne Moore's replacement of Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling, I did not have trouble with her in the role. This has less to do with her performance (which is fine), however, and more to do with her undeveloped character.  Like Lecter, Clarice has become older and wiser, but also more cynical.  Moore tries her best to fit Foster's mold while aging the character in this natural direction, but she's given little chance.  A clear mistake in the film is Starling's lack of presence, especially compared to the good doctor.  This problem is inherited from Harris's novel.  This mistake can be somewhat forgiven; adaptation must have been troublesome if even fantastic screenwriters such as Stephen Zaillian and David Mamet couldn't pull it off.  However, if they had the guts to change the ending (a noticeable improvement over the novel), why not work to develop Starling's character more fully?Less forgiving, however, is a certain lack of energy that casts a pall over proceedings.  The scenes shot in Florence (where a local cop, wonderfully played by Giancarlo Giannini, tries to capture Lector) are remarkable in design, construction, and pacing.  Outside Florence, the action tends to get muddled in religious ramblings, FBI casework, and a unique style of hog farming.Also problematic is the character played by Ray Liotta, an FBI agent and former lover to Clarice Starling who tries to make work very hard for her. He's synonymous with the Anthony Heald character of the first film. Instead of being ambitious, however, Liotta simply plays a jerk, so slimy that his fate is pretty obvious.  Liotta has (and could have) done better, but here again is a lack of character development.When things are all said and done, however, it's Hopkins' dynamic performance that deserves most of the attention (a debatable second: Giannini's Italian cop).  He refills Lector's shoes with graceful ease; one could say his performance in last year's ""Titus"" prepared him nicely. Although a certain aspect of his character is underplayed (which I will leave you to discover), he shows a natural aging of Hannibal that is most pleasing.  You might not be able to teach an old dog new tricks, but who cares when those tricks are so perfectly honed.Rating:  7 out of 10.",Hannibal

Such a stupid story, no guideline in the movie, the lost plot makes the movie very tasteless. There is nothing of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" in it, not the magic of the first movie.

The original is such a masterpiece that messed with your minds and had you on the edge of your seat.  Not to mention, the relationship between Dr. Lecter and Clarice was so intriguing while this movie was just shallow and gross.  Anthony Hopkins does a great job but I did not like Julianne Moore.  She did not fit the character at all.  I salute Jonathan Demme and Jodie Foster for having enough integrity to not do this movie because of the content.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone.",Hannibal

This movie will be profitable because of the gore and effects, the lure of Hannibal and the unjust casting of Moore for those who revere the Talented Ms. Foster.

The first time you saw SOTL, did you REALLY feel that it was as great as it was the 2nd, 3rd, 4th...time?  No!!  Give this movie a chance.  It is one of those movies that each time you watch it you will notice new things, new 'hidden' agendas and messages.Julianne Moore did an excellent job as Clarice and you don't even think for a moment that someone else used to play that role.  This movie definitely has potential.  For those of you that are looking to be handed every little detail, forget about it.  This movie leaves a lot to be thought about and as you leave the theatre, you will see what I mean.To me a good movie is one that leaves you thinking about it long after the closing credits.  Hannibal is just that movie.  For those of you that can't look deeper than the surface of a movie, there is always Saving Silverman. For those of you that need more from a movie, Hannibal is a sure bet.",Hannibal

It wasn't designed for that.  It was meant to cash in and make the suits who put in their money rich--period.Hopefully in the process it would entertain the audience but really...Who Cares.  It was destined to have a big opening and THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS. Right?So let's forget that the movie completely betrays the characters.Let's forget that the movie is, to quote Mr. Gibson, ""Boring as a dog's ass.""Let's just forget.It's the last 15 minutes of this flick we need to ponder.It's seems the principle players all ran for cover after reading the book--finding the original ending a tad too much.  So it was altered to please those involved but alas only Sir Anthony was left standing.My question--Who drew the line in the sand?  I mean really--the ending to this mess was such a train wreck of excess I have a real problem understanding at what point someone said.  ""Whoa...WHOA!  This is too much!""I have to admit the only thing I enjoyed about this flick was the ending and had the WHOLE movie stayed in that spirit we would have had another SHOWGIRLS on our hands.  The joy! The shear fantastic joy!  But no. Hell, no.  Ridley had to take himself seriously and that was a big mistake.  And had he kept, in addition, the original ending....We would have been in MOMMIE DEAREST territory. Drag queens and cultist everywhere- unite! But I guess Mr. Scott wanted to be taken serious again.  (He's an artist ya know.) He can't make crap! After all he's Oscar caliber talent. But then again so is Adrian Lyne...oh, well.So my advice.  Chow down on the popcorn.  Chug down your Coke. Set your alarm to go off in 110-or-so minutes...and wait for the squealing of the pigs.  The glorious shrieking pigs!

The new director and the revised cast worked very well together and the relationship between Lecktor and Starling lost no zest.I recommend this movie to those with a strong stomach only, it has its fair share of gore.

Overall I was seriously disappointed with this film though.  The violence was entirely gratuitous, and self-serving.  The gore wasn't part of an ingenious escape by Lecter (as we got in SoL with the face removal), but rather seemed to be nothing more than a gross-out contest.

803,nzf,Scott & Hopkins: Shame on You!,1,26 February 2001,"Scott, Hopkins, Warner Bros., Harris: Shame on You!!! After spending 650 Pesetas, and one afternoon in the bad taste company of Hannibal Lecter, I cannot hold my peace: This movie is, regarded as meta-comedy maybe acceptable as a bad joke. If 'Hannibal' is supposed to be taken seriously as an entertaining and thrilling piece of celluloid, I need to get rid of my anger and disappointment immediately: The movie is, in spite of Ridley Scotts estetical maneuvers, a disgrace in all meanings. It is totally predictible (many movies are, so this flaw does not make Hannibal uniquely bad per se, but one could expect the sequel of one of the most thrilling movies of the 90ees to perform in just remotely the same way), and lacks characters one can identify with, not to say feel sympathy or empathy with. Example: Just the beginning makes the skin crawl. The setup is so, so predictible and not even a bad police-show worthy. We see Starling take the good old confrontation with the local police before and operation is carried out. Pleaaaase! We then already know that everything is going to be messed up by the local police, and that Starlings badge eventually is going to fall. Not a bad setup, if You consider the perspectives of her pursuing Lecter on her own. But that doesn´t happen. The movie never really gets of, never gets exciting, and the characters are so out of focus that You lose interest in who is bad and good. No one really are. So eventually You lose interest in what´s  going to happen next. The characters are all bad persons without excuses, and worst of all: They do not evolve at all throughout the movie. 'Hannibal' is the most speculative, bizarre and perverse display of greed in the big moviemachine of Hollywood, YUCK!!! I´m sure that Hopkins, Scott and the rest of the involved are walking hand in hand all the way to the bank with a big grin on their faces. Instead of maintaining their integrity as serious artists, they have all displayed the worst case of 'prostitution' to big-bucks-box-office speculation by joining up to take part in this bizarre, meaningless and bad, self-reflecting joke. Please Mr. Harris, let Lecter disappear forever, and stop speculating in bizarre books designed for the exploitation of the boxofficepeople, and get back to the spirit and wit of 'Red Dragon', please...",Hannibal
804,Clarice-5,A Pleasure!,9,8 March 2001,"Hannibal is a pure pleasure! While a little unevenly paced (the beginning was a bit slow), David Mamet and Steve Zallian have done a good job of telling the basic story Thomas Harris gave to us - and, incidently, the book was incredibly underrated by critics whose thought processes seem to have been damaged by too little quality literature. People have complained that it took ten years for Harris to write it - well, read it! It is chock-a-block full of mythology, astronomical and religious themes that weave their way throughout. The threads never break. The movie would have had to be eight hours long to even begin to explore the depths plumbed by Harris in the book.Anthony Hopkins is, as usual, brilliant! Julianne Moore was sexy and strong. Giancarlo Giannini was outstanding and Gary Oldman creditable. My only complaint with casting was Ray Liotta, who just didn't have ""it"".Having seen this movie three times thus far, I will say that watching it is like peeling layers off an onion. You see more and more with each viewing - little treasures and nuggets that you find almost by accident. The first time I saw it, I left the theatre not really knowing what I thought of it. Then I found myself smiling. I did like it. When I went back again (and again!) I liked it more and more.Gory? Not really - and I consider myself pretty sensitive to gore. I have seen far worse. The story does have violence in it, and I think Ridley Scott, while depicting an integral part of the story, handled the violence tastefully (if you'll pardon the expression).Is it as good as Silence of the Lambs? No. It's DIFFERENT from SotL. In Silence we had a caged monster whose intensity was extremely focussed. Here, we have a monster who is on the loose in a great big world, free to indulge in his passions. Hannibal Lecter's essence has not changed. He's merely in a different situation.My only disappointments were: The changed ending. This was the major one. I realize the critics lambasted Thomas Harris for the ending in the book, saying ""Clarice would never have done that"", but Clarice was the child of Harris' imagination. The author is god, and if god says a character will do something, who are we to second-guess?The length of the movie. It could have been a little longer and more focus could have been put on the relationship between Hannibal and Clarice - specifically, his obsession with her, and the time they spent together after the fiasco at the Verger Estate.It was also too bad that Mason Verger's sister, Margot, was written out of the script.All in all, though, I thoroughly enjoyed the dark humor and the adventure. Hans Zimmer's score is magnificent! This is a really good film - not a great film, but a really good one.  Don't go into it expecting to see another Silence of the Lambs. It's not - and I don't think anyone has ever tried to claim that it is. Expect to see a weird and wonderful love story and an adventure! (It's just too bad about that ending!)",Hannibal

It is, in fact, one of the best and most intelligent movies shown on the screen lately. However, for those who understand its implications, it may be so disturbing that they regret seeing this masterpiece.Sir Anthony Hopkins was brilliant in the Silence of the Lambs, and he is no less enchanting in this one, and Julianne Moore as Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling is competent, as are most of the other actors. This helps making this movie so disturbingly hard to escape unaffected from.The story builds on the attraction between the main characters from the first movie, and takes it one step further, creating a very disturbing sensualism between the righteous as we know it and the ríghteousness of a madman.Hannibal Lecter, M.D.'s power to control humans and animals by speaking to them, and even by his very presence, influences even the viewers of this movie, and one is forced to reconsider one's definitions of good and bad. Who is guilty and who is innocent, who is right and who is wrong? Who is entitled to love and being loved?The gory images of this movie are extreme, but no more extreme than any Wes Craven horror movie. What makes it all too hard to laugh it off is the finesse with which it is carried out, the classical music and Dr. Lecter's elegance and respectability. Where the movie is not realistic, it is surrealistic, and it integrates those parts seamlessly in a very sneaky manner, blurring the contours of reality.Where I am from, this movie is allowed for youth from the age of 15. This movie should not be seen by anyone below the age of 20 and above the age of 35, and should not be viewed by anyone who has ever felt even remotely mentally unstable.",Hannibal

If the movie followed Silence's original formula they would have called it unoriginal.  If it had been fresh, new and unique, the critics would have called it a grave injust to a classic thriller.  Fortunaly though the makers of ""Hannibal"" have opted for a completly unique, scary, original and extremly excting film.
""Hannibal"" starts out 7 years after Silence.  Clarice is now a succsseful FBI agent and Hannibal Lecture-famous cannibal, has been on the run since his escape from Memphis.  To say anymore would be an insult to anyone who has not seen the film yet(if you havn't go do so NOW.)the movie is so excitng that one never wants it to end.  So suspenceful you'll bit your nails  the entire time.  So gory you'll cover your eyes and put your bag of popcorn as far away from you as possible.  Not to mention the film is eerily well acted by the two leads Hopkins and Moore.  Although I think Foster was a better Agent Starling, I think Moore is much more appropriate for the present character.  She is much more sexy and a little bit more vulnereble, somthing Foster couldn;t have done so successfully at this point in her life.  Hopkins is beautiful as everyones favourite cannibal. he is so scary and so mesmerizing that it is impossible to forget.
Although I would give the film a perfect '10"", it is definitely not for everyone.  for starters, th moveie is 10x more violent forcing even the most jaded horror buff to turn their head away in disgust.  Alsot the film climax is so completely over the top and unlike anything done ever before, that some viewers liking of the film may instantly dissappear.In conlusion, the film is a more than worthy successor to a classic.  It will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.",Hannibal

I enjoy Silence of the Lambs (especially the first time). The acting was very good. The story lacking. Especially the cartoon-character billionaire 'dark man' distorted face mask character obsessed by Lecter in his den of video screens controlling the world.

Technically superb on every level, it nevertheless generates little suspense and zero emotional involvement. Julianne Moore creates a character we care little about - she spends most of the movie warning others what Lecter's capable of doing. Anthony Hopkins, reprising his most famous role, offers nothing new as Hannibal; there's a certain feeling of seen-and-heard-that-before.

The controversial gore scene towards the end made myself, and the majority of the audience, flinch, scream and nervously giggle simultaneously (a feel good/feel bad movie rolled into one!).Having never read the original book I took the film at face value. It is beautifully filmed by a talented director and crew, and features lovely Italian location scenes which contrast with the grim plot. The acting is mainly excellent. Hopkins character appears creepier due to him beginning to resemble a kindly grandad, who suddenly turns and eats your brain. Julianne Moore`s excellent Clarice vaguely reminded me of Ripley, the star of Ridley Scotts masterpiece Alien. At worst, the rest of the cast were well above average.The film had me captivated with its style, twisty plot, acting and gore. I found myself slightly rooting for the baddie Hannibal at some points, something I haven`t experienced since my empathy for evil Alex in A Clockwork Orange. If people find the deaths of some characters predictable, then maybe Scott has directed well in projecting Hannibal`s approach and morality.This is the sort of big budget horror film movie-goers have been waiting for, so go see it on the large screen before its too late! Okay, it is not the same as Silence, so what? Ten years have passed and things have changed. I`ve heard the book is better.

If you think of it as a sequel to the 1991 classic, then you are in for a flop. On the other hand, if you consider it to be an independent film, then it is quite good. Many details, important details, were omitted, and this makes the story very complicated to comprehend for a person who has not read the book.

Silence of the Lambs was one of the if not the greatest movies of all time, and this so called sequel completely destroyed the story and the character, Hannibal Lector.  There was no plot, and the remnants of it was rediculous.  The violence was not as disturbing as it was funny.  It was so badly filmed and put together that I had to laugh.  There was nothing even redeemable about it at all.  I have gained a lot of respect for Jodie Foster for refusing to be in it.  Oh, and that's another thing.  Jullianne Moore had neither the looks, nor the acting ability to pull off Agent Starling.  And the ending had to have been the most pointless, mindless thing I have ever seen.

However, either way it would have because this movie was abosutely awful. The only positive was that Julianne Moore did a great Jodie Foster impression. The rest of the movie was poorly written relying on shock value to get the viewer to forget that crap they were watching.  SPOILER ALERT Ridley Scott's attempt at making Hannibal the hero fell way short because his evil far outweighs his apparent love for Clarice. As in the book, where Clarice becomes a cannibal at the end, here Scott refuses to go that far and makes Clarice dedicated to the FBI to the end even though she is supposed to hate them. The shock value got to the point of being ludicrous and stupid by the end. No craft was put in to this movie. In Silence of the Lambs it was what we had to imagine for ourselves that made it so creepy, but here, we do not have to think, we are just shown gruesome scenes that we can get sick over.All in all, this film gets a 1 out of 10 and I recommend Manos the Hands of Fate over this movie any day.",Hannibal
824,hephnat,A good sequel of... Legend,8,29 December 2002,"I saw the movie in a theatre last year and just bought a 2nd-hand copy of the DVD. And recently I also bought the DVD of Legend and parallels between those two films by Ridley Scott stroke me!Everyone says Hannibal isn't a sequel of Silence of the Lambs, and they're right: SOTL was a crime story and a thriller focused on the dialogue between young FBI studen Clarice and imprisoned Lecter. Hannibal is clearly a horror film where suspense and psychology are minor.But neither mythology nor mysticism. Hannibal is a new incarnation of the Lord of Darkness, Scott's arch-villain in Legend. And Clarice is the new princess Lily. Legend was very much oriented towards cannibalism: one of the trolls (a pig!) was a cannibal as was the green witch of the swamp.Florence is shown either in the morning mist or at night. And there is THIS music, this original piece of opera composed by Hans Zimmer from a sonnet by Dante. Mesmerizing, absolutely beautiful and totally outworldly - yet deeply melancholic and nocturnal.Legend was a dualistic film, yet Hannibal overcomes this view. In Legend, princess Lily faked the sacrifice of the unicorn because she was confident in the goodness and the innocence that had necessarily survived the fall. In Hannibal, Clarice consents to the sacrifice of the not-so-innocent police chief in order to testify that she's beyond judgement concerning Lecter.In SOTL, Lecter entered the intimacy if Clarice's childhood and helped her silence the slaughtered lamb within her soul. In Hannibal's soul, the cry of the lamb, or the unicorn, may never be silenced, but at least he'll know that he'll find in Clarice someone who has accepted him not as a criminal and a monster, but as a man and a victim. The rest is yet to be written... and filmed.So, as a word of conclusion, I'd say that Hannibal belongs to the works of Thomas Harris, Jonathan Demme and Ridley Scott together, and that it is both the counterpart of Silence of the Lamb and the lower and higher octave of Legend.All and all, I rate it 4/5.",Hannibal

Moore didn't seem as good as Jody Foster (who is rumoured to have turned the part down due to the script) at the character Clarice Starling, but was passable none the less.Doubtless if i hadn't seen SOTL so recently the movie would have faired much better, but if a film wants to get game from it's predecessors it should accept the downside of being compared with them.

THe first time you see the film, it is neccessary to get over the gore (namely the final ten minutes as every film critic has notoriously noted). The second time you view the film, Hopkins innately sucks you in once more to embody the true nature of evil.
Whereas the first film, Hannibal is a caged beast, confined, and only on screen for thirty minutes. Yet, in the second film, the beast is unleashed, and we are all along for the ride.PS- As a side note. Most people have seen the original film many times, and relish in its psychological horrors.

834,matt-2,"Anthony Hopkins is splendid, the story needs help.",8,14 February 2001,"There are two converging stories in Hannibal.  One is the story of the man himself, and the other is the story of the hunt for him.  Anthony Hopkins did a great job of carrying the former, and we begin to see different layers of the character Hannibal Lecter.  The Hannibal area of the film was done with a great sense of style.  Much of the mood was orchestrated by operas and all the finery with which Lecter surrounded himself.  If I were grading this film on this facet alone, I would say straight tens.The problem is with the other side of the story -- the part carried by Moore's portrayal of Clarice Starling.  I don't believe that the problems stem from anything the film-makers or actors did; I think it goes all the way back to Thomas Harris' novel.  It seems that from the beginning Mr. Harris didn't know exactly what he wanted to do with Starling, so she was all over the place and ended up adding very little.  They tried to compensate for the lack of plot in this area by filling it full of sound bytes from The Silence of the Lambs, but that just made it seem even more plotless.If you're reading these comments to decide whether or not to go see the movie, I'd say go ahead.  There are parts of it that I'm uncomfortable with, (such as the ending), but overall, I enjoyed it.",Hannibal
835,j0060333,a genuine opportunity greatly missed,5,17 February 2001,"Like most of you I'm fairly disgruntled with the movie, albeit for slightly different reasons. Some already have quite rightfully pointed out that a direct comparison between Hannibal and Silence of the Lambs actually misses the point: I think it is far more rewarding to see at least Thomas Harris' book as a good ""stand- alone"" story with the same characters. To me, the shift in tone and the different concept, namely Hannibal being hunted all over the world, is what is so appealing about ""Hannibal"". Frankly, it was the best Harris could do after Silence of the Lambs has been copied so many times in television, films and books throughout those past ten years that a different concept (not just another serial killer case that is to be resolved, but the account of a wide-spread hunting) was the only way of telling a halfway original story. I personally think of ""Hannibal"" as a thoroughly entertaining, well-written crossover between grotesque horror and black comedy. So for me, approaching the movie, the decisive question is ""what has Ridley Scott made out of the book?"" rather than ""holds it up to Silence?"". Which brings me to my main complaint about the movie: David Mamet and Steven Zailian have cut too much out in order to have the film running at ""acceptable"" length. The relationships between Starling/Bingham and Margot Verger/Barney (why they omitted Margot Verger and Jack Crawford only God knows)? gone. Lecter's background story, the perfect descriptions of his ""palace of mind"" and the poignant, moving childhood trauma of WWII? gone. These are the two main passages whose absence really spoils the movie for me: sure, the bond between the two pairs Starling/Bingham and Verger/Barney don't really push the film forward plot-wise but they would have provided the movie with much more character depth and emotional substance. Likewise, Starling's visit to the asylum wouldn't have necessarily meant story progress but it would have offered the chance to recreate a bit of the uncanniness those asylum scenes in Silence of the Lambs had. What I really don't understand is the omission of Lecter's past: it would have been a great counterpart to Starling's trauma in Silence and it would have become clear that these two characters are connected in another way. To be fair to Mamet, though, I've read that his first draft allegedly had a lot of insights into many characters. Given that, I find it even more incomprehensible that the story has been so drastically shortened. Scott and his writers could (and would probably) argue that you have to keep the story within a certain time limit which I accept  in the way that as a filmmaker you've got to make concessions in order to succeed commercially. But lets think of it: how much more running time would have the inclusion of those scenes added? Exactly. Another 15-20 minutes which, added to the already present 115 minutes, would have made the movie 130-145 minutes long. No one can tell me, that if the whole world went to see ""Titanic"" with its epic 190 minutes length a dozen times, the audiences wouldn't be able to endure a potential longer version of Hannibal. So, now this is an very direct comparison to the book, but let me say that I really tried to watch the movie on its own: I thought the first 35 minutes were so boring und uninspired that for a supposedly tense film of that order it borders on embarrassment. The second half works much better, but just about. Julianne Moore is a wonderful actress but miscast: she looks a bit too soft and I thought that there was no real chemistry between her and Anthony Hopkins (my favourite choice to replace Jodie Foster was Gillian Anderson all the way through anyway). I really tried to believe into Moore but all I could think of was Foster which surprised me 'cause I wouldn't have thought that her performance -as much as I admired it- had such a strong impact on me. The ending of the movie is a bit too open for my taste and though the book's ending was, as far as Starling's character was concerned, a step I couldn't quite conceive as plausible (Hannibal, yes, 'cause he dreamt of this for years), I feel that the book's ending was at least more original or exceptional. Despite the very graphic final ten minutes I think the film is just a ""soft version"" of the book: the book terrified me much more than the movie, not to mention Lecter's killing of the two officers in ""Silence of the Lambs"". Ray Liotta performs lacklustre and was in my opinion not a good choice to play Paul Krendler. So is there anything good about the film? Anthony Hopkins and Gary Oldman are both fantastic (Oldman's make-up is pure class and gets the more disturbing the longer you look at it - shame they had to reveal it straight away at the beginning: the book's subtle introduction to Verger was  m u c h better. Also Mason Verger was much meaner and menacing in the novel but that's the writers' fault and not Oldman's) and there are some reasonably well done scenes: my favourite one being the hanging of Pazzi. The moment when Lecter places his hand on Pazzi's shoulder was one of the creepiest in the movie and the whole sequence almost on a par with the most frightening sequences in the predecessor. It also demonstrated perfectly that a subtle approach works much better than showing a dozen close-ups of Krendler's brain. May I give this advice to Ridley Scott and Dino DeLaurentiis: don't make another sequel, remake your own film instead and do it right this time (I mean if Manhunter is considered to be remade, why not this one??). As it stands now, ""Hannibal"" marks middle ground in Scott's work, being nowhere as good as ""Alien"", ""Blade Runner"" or the reasonably good ""Gladiator"" but also fortunately not as bad as ""GI Jane"" or ""White Squall"". If you're uncertain about whether to see the film or not if you haven't done so as yet, buy ""Silence of the Lambs"" on Video or DVD and read Hannibal as a book. (** out of 5 stars or in the imdb rating: 5 out of 10)",Hannibal
836,kandsbogstad,Did Ridley Scott read the book?,8,6 April 2001,"Having just read the book the first thing that struck me was the big difference between the Hannibal Lecter of the book and the Hannibal of the film/s. In the book he comes across as a true psychopath: highly intelligent and cultured (self-taught), more multifaceted, but narrowly focused,  and with a single but major ""character flaw"", namely the nonchalance with which he not only kills his enemies, but also eats bits of them. In the films he is much more crazed killer than cultured man of the world, his violence more easily triggered whenever he feels trapped. This is not a complaint, it makes the book more readable and the film more watchable, but there is in my view a real distinction between the ""two"" Hannibals. The credit for this acceptability is obviously due to Anthony Hopkins who, despite Ridley Scott's best attempts, embues Hannibal with real characterisation. What made me say that? The fact the Scott leaves out the most important background information in the story by far: why Hannibal has such (paternal/fraternal?) feelings for Starling, and what made him the cannibal he is, namely that as a child he witnessed the killing and eating of his little sister by crazed mountain folk, facts of which Starling are not aware, but are his continual obsession. In her mind any empathy comes from her admittance to vulnerability in the original ""Silence of the Lambs"" episode. Scott never offers us any kind of background or characterisation, he is just content to make a decent thriller/horror film by numbers. If Boris Karlof had been alive today he would have used him. He made the same mistake in Gladiator. In fact the staccato pace with which the first half of the film moves along proves my point, that Ridley Scott is anxious to put away all necessary background and get to the horror and gore. OK, there is fine dividing line (not quite successfully drawn in the book) between making Hannibal ""interesting"" and making him ""likeable"", and I don't ever want to be faced with ""Hannibal the Musical"" with Julia Roberts as Starling and a Sound of Chewing chorus of flesh-eating offspring, but more ""fleshing out"" (no pun intended) of their relationship and fascination for each other would have made the film so much more interesting, in fact moved it on to a different level. The lighting effects were borrowed from Bladerunner, and the music from Alien 3, and it was painfully obvious that none of the main actors were ever actually in Florence during the shoot. Compare this with ""Seven"", ""Copycat"" or ""Heat"", where a slow but steady build-up and oodles of characterisation made those three films what they are. I could suggest that Ridley Scott was never allowed by Dino de Laurentis (the producer)to include those ""pauses for breath"" that make films so much better, and which were so successfully used in Alien and Bladerunner, both five star movies. But back to Hannibal. I preferred the second half, far more Gothic. But again we could have used a bit more background. That the film is so enjoyable is purely down to the actors. Anthony Hopkins made his name by playing shy, middle-aged English gentlemen. To see him as Hannibal Lecter, in close-up, is to realise that here we have an actor of real stature. Mesmerising. As for Julianne Moore, she got lumbered  when Jody Foster disqualified herself. ""Central casting? We need a competent never-heard-of-before actress, who doesn't even remotely look like Jodi Foster, to play token female, typically competent, bitter, world weary, shafted-by-her-corrupt-superiors FBI agent."" Julianne who? How many dollars? OK, we'll take her!"" She did a highly competent job within the constraints of Scott's directing, I hope we will see more of her work, and I do not agree that she merely attempted to play Foster playing Starling - she was never given the chance. As for Gary Oldman  - terrific! In conclusion therefore, a highly enjoyable, albeit frustrating to the reading public, film that should have been 45 minutes longer. 6 out of ten for direction, an average of 8.5 for acting, an average of 7.25 overall. Fair enough?",Hannibal
837,suycott,Almost as bad as trashy talk-shows.,4,28 February 2001,"Like ""Silence Of The Lambs"" this film has created another call to our censors. However Thomas Harris's novel has been toyed with a little too much for this reviewers liking, with every element of the plot and characters dumbed down for the ""Jerry Springer"" watching audience.Hannibal is not a story for cheesy horror fans, yet it is presented in cheesy horror format. Director Ridley Scott (Alien, Bladerunner) has a flashy visual style (which was used to great effect in the 1992 flop ""1492 Conquest Of Paradise"") but can't manage the substance to give this film balance. Nor is the dialogue our two leads Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore have to contend with up to scratch leaving them with luck-lustre performances.Moore (Boogie Nights) has been set up to be verbally pounded, filling Jodie Foster's shoes as FBI Agent Clarice Starling. Not much direction, or worth in the script effectively waste an extremely talented actress, while Hopkins (Shadowlands) as our flesh eating fiend Hannibal attempts to work with his character but to no avail.Also wasted are ""Goodfella's"" Ray Liotta as Ray Krendler a fly in Agent Starlings ointment, and Gary Oldman (Romeo Is Bleeding) as Manson Verger, Hannibal's 4th victim (who in the book is scarier and far less goofy, although a fine job by the make-up department, aid Oldman who works harder than anyone else in the film).Alongside an ever growing list of factual and continuity errors, is my problem with the foreshadowing imagery of the book. The filmmakers have kept the imagery in the movie but in almost every case cut out the event which it was foreshadowing.Despite the stellar cast, no-one from scriptwriter Steven Zaillian (Awakenings) right up to director Scott, knows how to make this film stand alone. Scott (who possibly believes he's returned to form after the success of ""Gladiator"") should watch his first feature film ""The Duellists"" and realise what he was capable of without a huge budget.How author Thomas Harris can say he's pleased with the film is beyond me. This film had the potential to take viewers into the darkness and see through the looking glass, what's on the other side of a genius lost to evil. But sadly in its present state, I couldn't even recommend it as a budget video. Such a shame directors David Lynch (Blue Velvet) or David Fincher (Fight Club) weren't at the helm of this project.Perhaps their invigorating talents, might have been able to take this to the dizzying heights of our 1991 rendezvous with Hannibal, oh well, the way this is raking in the cash, one can hope they get offered shot the next sequel.Two Stars",Hannibal
838,eor14,Don't waste your money!,1,21 February 2001,"I like a lot of you, had been waiting for this movie to be released.  So opening weekend, my roommate and myself went to see it.  We both loved Silence of the Lambs so we were expecting great things from this movie.  I have never been so bored in my entire life!  I knew I was in trouble when I looked at my watch and the movie had only been on for 20 minutes!!! It felt like hours!The plot, if you could call it that, lacked all imagination.  There was no psychological edge to it as there had been in Silence of the Lambs.  While the killings were inventive, the film went for gore over substance.  There was no suspense; if you had seen Silence of the Lambs the one part of the movie that may have provided some suspense was blatantly obvious.My advice to all of you who haven't seen it yet, don't bother....wait for it to come out on video and rent it if you must see it...you won't lose anything by watching it on video.",Hannibal
839,mwjergs,Where is the suspense?,7,21 February 2001,Overall I think that I enjoyed the film but since it is a sequel to what I feel is a fantastic movie I did feel a little disappointed. There is very little suspense or mystery involved in this movie as opposed to Silence. For example the hideous Mason Verger could have been held in the shadows for a much longer time and then revealed later for greater shock value. Instead he is shown full face view in the first scene. On the positive side the performance of Hopkins was great as expected. He really enjoys playing this character and it shows. Julianne Moore was very good as well but it's just hard not trying to see what Jodie Foster would look like in her place in most scenes. Ray Liotta is at his oily best as the crooked FBI man.,Hannibal
840,iaptyx,Nothing to do with the excellent book- Awful movie :(,1,22 February 2001,"Honestly, I'd expect a better movie from Ridley Scott after Gladiator.Where's his fine lifestyle? Where's all the elegant cars? Why's the scenario so confusing? Why the end looks like b-thriller and has nothing to do with the original finale? Do they plan another follow? They've failed.Unfortunately the book is so better that I won't see that movie again. I want to stay with the initial impression of Hannibal as he's presented in the book.",Hannibal
841,kingsun1,a little disappointing...,3,3 March 2001,"I realized going into the movie that expecting a ""Silence of the Lambs II"" was unrealistic.  But this movie, was very disappointing.  First of all, Gianini's character was weak.  I don't understand why he didn't just attack Lector the second he knew who he was.  Why the charade when you are dealing with one of the most ruthless cannibals?  Another thing that disappointed me was the soap opera between Lector and Clarice. After awhile, it was clear that the two had feeligs for each other and the fear of Clarice losing her life was nonexistent. Not to mention that I was almost cheering for Lector towards the end of the movie, as Liotta's character proved to me even more evil than Lector's. Let me see, if I pick the cannibal over the bureaucrat then there is something wrong.  Jody Foster had fear in her eyes when she approached Lector, and rightfully so.  This new Clarice was more of a supercop, something I felt was not consistent with ""Lambs"".  Back to the soap opera, I couldn't understand how Clarice was unable to locate Lector, considering nothing happened to her in the end.  She should have been able to follow him (she was snapping out of her drug induced state) and see where he fled to amidst the swarm of police backup arriving.  And Hannibal's hand?  Give me a break, just cut the handcuffs in half.",Hannibal

843,Lobba,"Good, very good but not silence of the lambs good",8,6 March 2001,"Don't get me wrong this is an amazing movie. But unfortunately it just isn't anywhere near as good as Silence of The Lambs. Obviously produced much better than its predecessor (obviously because of the 10 year difference in technology). The plot is sketchy at best, the rushed filming is obvious when you watch it. Another brilliant performance by Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal, but Julianne Moore failed to perform as Starling. Comparisons to Jodie Foster should not be made here. Of course, the difference between hannibal and silence is that where silence was a movie about clarice starling, Hannibal was a movie about Hannbal Lecter. Maybe, that's why the emphasis us not on Julianne Moore's mediocre performance.All in all, definitely a good movie, but it lacks the screenplay and plot of silence of the lambs, and that's where it tries to make up in shock value. This is a bad idea. Hannibal, see it on the big screen for maximum enjoyment.-Lobba",Hannibal
844,room217,Hannibal is a totally different film than Silence...,8,8 March 2001,"I have always been a fan of Ridley Scott and Thomas Harris and after Gladiator last year i was really looking forward to this sequel. And i actually liked the book Hannibal very much and i think that all the readers that didn't like the book and also thought that Harris was pressed to write another book about Hannibal Lecter by the film company(which i think is bullocks to be frank) had decided early on that the film wasn't going to be good. But i think that it was and if you say to yourself that this one is going to be totally different as a film than Jonathan Demme's Silence of the lambs then you are off to a good start. Because Scott has made a extremly stylish, goulish and almost romantic horror-thriller that is very true to the book. I thought that both Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore were very good, it can't be easy to fill the shoes of original Starling, Jodie Foster, but Moore is a better actress and tries do her version of Starling, not imitate Foster. Where Silence... was a tight, exciting detective-thriller, Hannibal is more of a opera/horror/romance thriller that sometimes slides over to macabre humour. I thought it was scary and thrilling and very intense. I've heard and read some people say, it doesn't happen anything in the movie, it's not very scary, eehh, do you have any imagination at all? It's the same thing with Blair witch project, a fantastic horror movie. But if you can't feel yourself in the situation and if your imagination doesn't start up, well then it's your loss. And if you have set your mind for a Silence 2, you're bound to be disappointed. It's not easy to follow up a movie like Silence... but i think Hannibal was a very good try. I liked it a lot!",Hannibal

I read the book after I saw the film, and don't see what all the fuss is about. There was not a great amount of difference between the book and the film (surely you have to allow for some changes) and as for the ending of the film (which everyone seems to disapprove of), I actually thought the ending of the film was more realistic. It leaves the story open for the possibility of another film, and still captures the feelings between Hannibal and Clarice. He chopped off his hand instead of hers and escaped. This showed his love for her. I was delighted that he'd got away and I think a part of Clarice was also relieved. I think the book's ending was too far- fetched, and closes the story line up. I loved the film and I must say again that Anthony Hopkins in this film, is the most stunning and sexy being ever to have walked the face of the earth - and I don't want to hear anyone say otherwise!

His style of directing is just too ""visual"" for this movie.Things that I liked about Hannibal were acting and the music.

The book is by far better than the movie! I know that a movie must be shorter, but the movie isn't clear. For example the breeding af the pigs isn't at all mentioned in the movie, while in the book Harris explains there origin complete.

Anthony once again did a deliciously scary job as Lecter, and Julianne, in my opinion, made a better Clarice than Jodie Foster. The movie was more psychological than scary. It was better than the book, especially the ending. If you haven't seen it, then you need to. A rare sequel, that may be better than its predecessor. The actor and actress' made this movie reach its full potential. Ray Liotta did a great job as the jerk of the movie, Paul Krendler.

Hannibal Lechter, a captivatingly paradoxial character in Silence of the Lambs, has been reduced little more than an 80's slasher villain in Hannibal. As the audience we soon learn that the movie does everything to justify Hannibal's grisly killings and we are to believe that the maneater is some sort of misguided hero..  Unfortunatly, in a feeble attempt hide the failings of it they resort to shocking the audience with scenes of depraved violence. If they make another movie, expect to see Mr. Lechter chasing a newly wedded bride down with a cake knife and forcing her to eat her husband's intestines (shaped like a wedding cake complete with frosting) who will no doubt deserve what he got due to some shady real estate transaction.

Julianne Moore is no Jodie Foster and it shows. In the end, Jodie Foster was right when she said a sequel was inappropriate.

The sad thing is, the plot moved so slowly, I didn't miss anything. The first five minutes or so were great, then it gradually got slower and more tedious to sit through. As for the ""gruesome"" scenes, they weren't that good, realistic or gory as people said they were. I would comment more specifically, but it would be giving something away, what little you could give away with this movie. Also, I didn't like Julianne Moore's portrayal of Claire Starling. The acting wasn't bad, but it wasn't as good as Jodie Foster in Silence of the Lambs. Overall, I can't see why so many people liked this movie, and I hope they never try to make another one like it.

And, most damaging of all, gone is Jodie Foster. What is left is Dr Lecter turned into a scary ghoul who makes the audience titter in nervous appreciation/anticipation, gore to mask the lack of content, and longuers and confusion in place of narrative cohesion.The novel reads like it was written to be made into a movie. But it does not translate. Without the explanations of the novel, the issue of pigs from Sardinia et al appears ludicrous and contrived. It assumes you have read the novel.If you want a gore fest then it serves it up well enough, but it has too many holes in the plot (how did Lecter get in and out of the USA?) and belies belief and reality so that anyone looking for the intellectual challenge and stimulation of Silence is left sorely disaffected.",Hannibal

868,ljupina,A Farce.,2,1 February 2007,"While I wasn't a huge fan of SOTL, I could see how it was a good movie. It worked in a lot of ways.Hannibal took what worked and put it through the garbage disposal.See, many people will bash this movie for being gory. It isn't the gore itself that is reprehensible about the movie, its how it is used. The gore just seems to be used as tacked-on shock factor. Just in case we couldn't tell someone is dying a horrible death, the movie is so kind to give even those who are barely aware what is going on in the film to understand that someone is dying.And that's a big problem with the movie. It's as if it is written for someone with no sense of nuance. It's like how a 3 year old thinks a toy has COMPLETELY disappeared and has no idea where it has gone if you hide it under a blanket.It is completely amazing to me how Hopkins expects Hannibal to work. Apparently Lector is this mind-stunningly intelligent psychiatrist who just happens to be a tragic hero who eats his victims. I mean, he's not so bad. He only kills bad people! But don't hold back on our account, Mr. Hopkins. I don't think he could have made it more obvious that he is an over-the-top creepshow. I mean, who cares if it is believable at all that someone this obviously disturbed was a successful psychiatrist who seduces his victims to mutilate themselves or worse? Then again, you weren't exactly nuanced in SOTL either.Now to Julianne Moore. I don't know if the whole setup of the movie was just some strange masturbatory fantasy about Lector and Clarice falling in love, but it sure seemed to come out that way. In SOTL, Clarice developed from someone who feared Lector, to someone who could stay strong in the face of mental manipulation and stand her ground against Lector- and even genuinely grow as a person. Now, apparently, Clarice has been reduced to some doe-faced damsel in distress. This isn't Julianne's fault. However, I'm fairly certain she was cast for the role just because of the blank look on her face in the whole movie.Gary Oldman plays a man who you're supposed to think is repulsively disfigured. Though, you learn quickly, that his mind is just as warped. This is another ""Let's make it obvious to the viewer"" tidbit thrown in. The movie has no room for an intelligent viewer. There ARE ways of showing that someone could be mentally scarred without cheesily implying that from the way he looks. Then again, if the movie didn't show this man as heavily scarred, you might just believe that Hannibal isn't some kind of superhero in disguise. I mean, every superhero needs a nemesis that in some way the superhero is responsible for, right? You see, his character is the lone person to sully the otherwise superhuman record that Hannibal had of not leaving people alive.Oldman's character and the way Hopkins plays Lector go hand-in-hand, in some disturbed way. I mean, only the most mentally deficient patient could possibly be taken in by someone as so obviously deranged as Lector (or at least how Hopkins plays him).The rest of the characters are rounded out in typical fashion in that they are merely props to try to convince us that, in the grand scheme of things, this psychiatrist cannibal isn't such a bad guy after all! However, since all movie viewers are obviously stupid, let's make sure we remind them every now and then that Lector is an evil person- by showing him disembowel someone or making some lame pun about how he's going to devour someone. There's only one actor that could make these one-liners more obvious. Arnold.If you're looking for a 21st century adaptation of B grade 80's horror kitsch, watch this movie. If you're looking for a movie that is a more intelligent thriller in comparison to Hannibal, watch Deuce Bigalo.",Hannibal

872,phuocle,Not as gory/disturbing as some make it out to be - may contain SPOILERS,7,5 May 2003,"HANNIBAL is the fourth film in the series and made third.  I've always thought it was the third film, but I've just learned that there was a prequel to Red Dragon called Manhunter.  I'll get that movie soon so that I'm complete on the series.  I've also bought the books just so that I can compare them to the comments on these movies so far.  I've found that it's better to see a movie first and then read the books - doing it the other may jeopardize your enjoyment of a movie.  So the series in chronological order is: Manhunter, Red Dragon, Silence of the Lambs, and Hannibal.First off, I did not find HANNIBAL as gory or disturbing as other viewers. Maybe I'm a little desensitized compared to them or they're just wimps, I don't know.  I do considered myself normal and a little sarcastic so that may shed some light on where I come from.  The scenes that usually bother people are: 1. The scene on the balcony between Dr. Hannibal Lecter and Commendatore Rinaldi Pazzi and 2. The dinner scene with Dr. Hannibal Lecter, FBI Agent Clarice Starling (Moore), and Justice Department Official Paul Krendler (Liotta).  They are grahpic, I'll grant that, but not over the top like some viewers have said here.  Again, you are the best judge of whether you can handle it or not, but I'd say if in doubt, go for it - it's definitely not going to scar you for life... after all, it's just a movie and if you let it bother you then you have other problems.The acting in this movie is great - contrary to what other people have said, Moore did a good job as Starling.  I would have preferred to have Jodie Foster back like most people, but Julianne Moore did a very good job as did Anthony Hopkins as usual.  I was surprised by Giancarlo Gianinni (Commendatore Rinaldi Pazzi) - he did a good job in a supporting role. Gary Oldman as Verger was good as well - it only took me a few moments to recognize him under the make-up.Some people have wondered what the music is in the opera scene and have searched without success for it.  Contrary to the information you will find here, it's not an existing opera.  It's just a piece written especially for the movie.  The text is based on Dante's ""La Nuova Vita.""  If you want the music, buy the soundtrack - it's Track 2 I believe.Don't let other reviews steer you away from this movie.  Silence of the Lambs was good, but very hyped in my opinion.  I actually prefer this to it and Red Dragon above all. I give this one 7/10.",Hannibal
873,randommathatsmeXD,Not really good...,4,8 May 2011,"After seeing the previous of these delightful films, I was disappointed by this one. When it finally gets to the proper gore after over an hour of the characters basically just talking, you have lost interest with the plot and can't wait to get the film over with. I can honestly say I fast-forwaded most of the movie and just watched the ending, much to my dismay.However,the beginning is what moved my vote up though. The film starts off pretty good, but drastically declines and loses its good quality about half an hour into the main plot. If you are thinking about watching this, just don't waste your time expecting something that doesn't exist.",Hannibal
874,tarasphalt,The Best Horror I've Seen In Ages,10,18 August 2005,"The movie ""Hannibal"" pushes the viewer over the brink- for those of you that are sensitive to these type of graphic horrors. The movie had backbone and was known for disturbing a lot of people. Hopkins returns as the 'psychiatrist gone mad' Hannibal Lecter- a man who is not only known for eating his victims, but using their minds as tools and weapons against them. Lecter ends up on the run and Clarice Starling (played by the ever so dynamic Julianne Moore) is sent on a manhunt to find the cannibal at large. The manhunt takes her to the artistic city of Florence, Italy where Hannibal is running amok. There is another catch to the film. It seems that there is another individual who is hunting Lecter and wants him more than the Law. His name is Mason Verger and he was a victim that survived an attack from Dr. Lecter several years prior. Mr. Verger is also a sadistic psychopath who wants cold and hard vengeance for the attack. As a director of low budget films and independent screen writer of short stories etc., I look at movies mostly from a directors standpoint. I break down the film's technical aspects as well as how it was directed and how it was written. I look at how the film impacted me first and then how it hit critics and then the viewers. Because of these tools, it is almost impossible to shock me. Hannibal beat the tests. Hannibal, to me, revolutionized the visual effects field of realism when it comes to gore- other films followed. I'm an artist / painter- been one since I was a kid. I know all about lighting and special make-up effects, so I put a film under close scrutiny. Not only does the film rate a 10 for realistic effects on all spectrum, all technical aspects (lighting, sound, directing, editing, music, acting) fits to a tee- like a glove. The film's artistic merit not only lies in the visuals and audios, but the way it was written- like an opera of horror, not to mention the artistic implications of historic locations and poetic dabbling giving examples of Dante's Inferno crossing and placing itself in the 'macabre' section of horror. ""Hannibal"" not only is a visceral ride through graphic violence, but an artistic ride through excellent locations, excellent music and cultural expansions. There are reasons for the demise of the people within Hannibal's grasp. In my opinion, you have to be a philosopher and artist with a knowledge of some religious texts- this movie is not for the simple minded. But that's what makes ""Hannibal"" such a rare gem- you cannot digest the movie in one sitting- you have to see it several times to understand its multi-dimensional avenues. Ridley Scott did a stupendous job- more than he got credit for. I don't usually watch psycho thrillers but this one is unlike any I've ever seen. It's an original- a trend setter for imitators. The final punch from the film that made me give it a solid 10 was the fact of how unpredictable it was. It's real and possible and ""Hannibal"" is a wake up call for the people that think the world is a happy apple pie. See it if you dare and read the book if you dare.",Hannibal
875,theegohaslanded-1,What could have been done better,8,4 May 2005,"While I don't wish to compare Jodie foster and Julianne Moore, I wanted to point out Julianne Moore should have done a better job. It is obvious that the first time Agent Clarice speaks to Dr.Lecter is the first time that her Southern accent is actually noticeable while all the time, previously, she spoke completely differently/normally. The entire movie through, she seemed in mild shock.. or is that just the way she acts... yea, it was a bit like that in Magnolia too...Ridley Scott's direction shows through as the film focuses less on the main character and more on the dark atmospheres and eerie music, much like alien. Anthony Hopkins was good as usual, but it was clear that the awe for his character would have to depend on viewership of the previous movies.However, all in all, the film still manages to be very watchable, although, not up to par with the previous two.",Hannibal
876,SamMosqueda,Not For Fans of The Silence of the Lambs,6,14 January 2014,"The Silence of the Lambs is a cold and gritty crime thriller that is the best in its genre. It is so good, in fact, that it is one of only four titles I have given a perfect rating to, the others being Forrest Gump, The Shawshank Redemption and Breaking Bad. The ending was so fascinating that it demanded a sequel. So when I heard there was a sequel and a prequel I was, of course, excited. Unfortunately, the sequel fell flat and felt bland. First, the positive: Julianne Moore was great as Detective Clarice Starling and Anthony Hopkins revived his role, as Hannibal Lector, masterfully. But no matter how well this movie is acted I cant help but notice the lackluster script and sub par plot. First things first, why does half this movie have to take place in Italy? One of the best things about the original was how it had small settings like the prison Hannibal Lector is in and Buffalo Bill's house. But this movie has many places that are sold as so important but just never grip the audience. All the supporting characters are expendable seeing as how half of them die in an anticlimactic way. Plus this movie feels like it is building up to something big, four or five times only to deflate the excitement. This sequel pays no justice to the original.",Hannibal
877,irc030702,Good Show!,8,28 December 2004,"I originally saw Silence Of The Lambs when released on VHS video in the early 90s. This week, I acquired a DVD of SOTL. Despite the so-so reviews I've read about Hannibal, I got that DVD too so I could watch these two films back-to-back in one sitting. I like film series, generally. Hannibal was a well-made film and worthy sequel to SOTL.Julianne does a fine job as Clarice...but...I have a hard time getting past Julie's different look from Jodie as FBI agent Clarice. It's distracting! Seems to me that the VERY LEAST they could've done was color Julie's red hair to brunette as a token attempt to make her look more like the original Jodie actress.I'm SO glad they didn't hire another actor to play Hannibal! Tony IS Hannibal, period, and casting another actor in that role would've been pure sacrilege! Even sillier than casting Mickey Rooney as an Asian in Breakfast At Tiffany's ;-)",Hannibal
878,jbusquet,Not good enough,3,14 May 2017,"I have to say that I watched the movie after reading the book and it has deeply disappointed me. I only wanted to watch it for seeing on a screen the end of the book but the screenwriters have changed the end so for me this movie has no sense. They have also deleted one of my favorite characters:Margot (one of the most important in the book). I can't understand why they have done so many changes to the plot when they had such a big novel in front of them. The movie seems a bad summary of things that happens during the novel. They have changed so many things that in the end nothing makes sense. It's like they hadn't had enough time to do things well. This is also a pity because the actors did a great performance (specially Hopkins). I think this movie could have been something big. Please do not watch this movie, buy the book instead. I know it's more expensive but I promise you it is worth.",Hannibal
879,uiop78997899,Waste of talent and film. Thoroughly ruined by Julianne Moore,3,18 October 2014,"Cant think of anything good to say about this utterly unbelievable film except of course Anthony Hopkins. Ray Liotta and Gary Oldham's characters are pointless and their immense talents wasted. But the rotten cherry on top was a terribly cast ""Clarice"" played by Julianne Moore. Her one dimensional, stoic and unlikable ""tough guy"" personality doomed this film from the beginning. My closest comparison is Patrick Stewart vs William Shatner playing Star Trek's Capt Kirk. Shatner being multi dimensional, likable, smiles, and even occasionally vulnerable and flawed. Stewart being the polar opposite. The plot is stereo-typical Hollywood. Any good film has a very strong ""bad"" character, force or entity. Despite his atrocities, Lecter's character is still virtuous and charming. Unlike ""Silence"", which clearly has that hate-able villain ""Hannibal"" painfully lacks one. 3/10 stars for its lack of direction, meandering and pointless plot and the fore mentioned utter unbelievability. Kudos and integrity points for Jodie Foster walking away from this big paycheck / bloated whale of a film.",Hannibal
880,liniel,Magically Delicious,7,13 August 2006,"Definitely not as binding as the Silence of the Lambs, but Hannibal does seem to radiate that sense of thrill and fear that fans of the prequel adore. I for one was expecting a bit thicker plot that was a bit more believable but when you're talking of a crazed cannibal that escaped maximum security facilities, being believable isn't always first on the priority list. Entertainment is. Hopkin's is charming as the psychotic Dr. Lecter and displayed more of his sensual desires for Agnet Starling that I felt were put on hold during SOTL. It was definitely pleasing to see that being carried out. Also the gore was much more present which I thought took away from the plot. When you have a movie with such intense gore, you need a thick plot to complement, otherwise it is no better than your everyday slasher, and we all know that Dr. Lecter is much too tactful to be put into the same lower echelon as Michael Meyers or Freddie Kruger. All the same I thought that Gary Oldman did a tremendous job as Mason Verger. So disgusting on the inside and out that you wondered if the boars really got a good meal. Jodie Foster not coming back really put a damper on the casting. There was a certain chemistry between her and Hopkins that cannot be ignored. It was a disappointment nonetheless. But all in all the film was entertaining, chilling, disturbing, and delicious.",Hannibal
881,SinisterGoingsOn,Tragically Misunderstood,9,3 February 2006,"While the film did indeed have several drawbacks, the removal of Jodie Foster and Jonathan Demme for example, Anthony Hopkins was superb as the Good Doctor, finally let out of his ""plexiglass prison"", showing the audience and Clarice just how monstrous he could be. Julianne Moore's portrayal of Clarice Starling is one often slated, and I fail to understand why, as she brought the human side of the character to life in much the same way as Jodie Foster did in ""Silence"".Often ignored is Giancarlo Giannini, playing Commandatore Pazzi. Much like Kevin Spacey in ""L.A. Confidential"" you wonder how he ever became a police officer.The F.B.I. are portrayed as heartless, backstabbing politicians in this film, and was one of the things that I thought was immensely unconvincing. It is, however, fun to see Paul Krendler get what's coming to him in the now infamous scene. I'll say no more on that...The two words which make this film great: Anthony Hopkins. His performance is flawless, and even in the face of impending death he still finds time to insult the rude.This is the sequel to ""Silence"", but you must remember that ""Silence"" is about captivity. The well in Buffalo Bill's basement, the true ""Billy"" trying to break free, Dr. Lecter in solitary confinement etc. ""Hannibal"" about freedom. Lecter is ""out there"", and no-one knows where he is until he reveals himself. He lives in a large, roomy apartment, which I found interesting to note, and he walks down the streets of Florence with reverence.Ridley Scott did very well with this film, especially looking at his other titles such as ""Alien"" and ""Black Hawk Down"", you would consider material such as this out of his range, but, in my opinion, he did superbly.9/10 Excellent",Hannibal
882,fallen_one_9,Dante,9,31 July 2005,"I like the movie, because there's more to it than the eye can see. It's the elements of Dante that do it for me: the water, the wood,..(signs of hell), Hannibal who actually is the devil and cannot be punished unless by himself and he also does(because he loves Clarice, maybe not like a lover but like a father and the devil cannot love that's why he punishes himself. Hannibal kills his victims but actually if you look to Dante : the devil only punish the ones with sins, piazza is killed because of his greed, mason is punished the first time because he's a child molester and the second time that leads to his death because of his craving for revenge. The acting of Hopkins as Lector I found marvelous, as well as I liked the other acting performances. The camera-work was very good. I always heard people say that there's too much violence in this movie (but of course there will be a lot of violence, the devil will not punish people by kissing them. I'm not that conservative but if you think there's a devil and it's evil then its punishments will be extremely bloody. I found it perfect that there was a lot of violence in it.

884,authorwizard,This is a horror movie,7,22 January 2006,"If you do not like horror movies (as some reviewers clearly do not) you will probably will not like this movie. On the other hand, even fans of the original Silence of the Lambs who can stomach gore will enjoy this well done sequel.Although, naturally, with a different director there are changes in the approach to the characters and the presentation of the action in this movie. However, there are no compromises. Anthony Hopkins returns in his most memorable role as Hannibal Lechter. The screenplay benefits from the addition of accomplished writers David Mamet and Steven Zaillian. Julianne Moore is a stunningly perfect replacement for Jodi Foster's lead character and real Italian actors are used for the scenes shot in Florence. Viewers also will not forget the performances of Gary Oldman and Ray Liotta playing characters unlike any of their previous roles. Basically, you have to admire someone on this list, making this film definitely one to watch.That being said, you should remember that this picture gets an R-rating because of the violence. Director Scott displays his penchant for slow, quiet moments punctuated by sudden, shocking gore. Instead of the eerie suspense of the original Silence of the Lambs, we get a more brutal sense of evil. POSSIBLE SPOILER: Dr. Lechter represents an unstoppable force of impending doom, his demented will, uncanny ability to survive and to elude, and his dangerously clever intellect drives the story from place to place, putting all the other characters in peril.If you can stomach the blood and guts shock, you will appreciate the subtle horrific presentation. However, if you want something more in the way of a classic, Psycho-styled, suspense film, stick with the original Silence of the Lambs.",Hannibal

Anthony Hopkins was absolutely brilliant in this movie, though i say he could have been crazier (he acted insane in the first film, why not the second?). And although it sucked that Jodie Foster wasn't Clarice this time around, the role of Clarice was still very good-- Clarice was very innocent, which was a good thing. She SHOULD appear vulnerable when she is chasing down Hannibal Lecter. He's a very scary guy.Silence of the Lambs had more suspense, but if you're into more violence, i'd say this film is better. it could have been more of a psychological thriller, but personally, i like more blood and gore :)",Hannibal

Hannibal sees right through his plans, and eventually, he ""takes care"" of him... And let's not forget about Mason Verger's lust for revenge... He is really the bad guy in this movie, and I think that many out there agree with me... I mean, Dr. Lecter's victims are not what you would call innocent.

The overall tone of this film is quite different from the first.  Instead of subtlety and an intriguing relationship between Starling and Lecter, the film seems to get bogged down in unnecessary subplots. Ray Liotta's character is also unbelievable in that he says such misogynistic things and is not reprimanded for it by Clarice or the FBI.  It's hard to believe that he wouldn't be fired for some of the comments he made, even in the male-dominated FBI.  Starling and Lecter don't even get together until the last 25 minutes or so.  And where was the plot of the film?  Where was the character development?  I would have liked to have known of any reason for why Lecter is the way he is.  What was the point of it all, except as some kind of technical exercise for Ridley Scott?  There were also some character 'entrances' that were thrown away.  Where was the buildup to Verger's or to Lecter's first appearances on the screen?  And where did the story logic go?  How could Lecter be so invincible?  How did he get into and out of the US so easily?  How did he make the people he drugged do or allow the things they did?  Do poppers really make someone that crazy?  I also find it offensive that the film should exploit such beautiful music, such as part of the Goldberg Variations by Bach, and put this music in such an ugly setting.  The first film was witty and made some good points.  The second is only elevated by Anthony Hopkins' great performance.  Apart from that, it's just plain ugly.",Hannibal
890,Jett-3,Rotten to the core,2,3 September 2001,"This was one of the worst 'credible' movies I have ever seen.  The plot was way too slow, and the acting was horrible.  Shame on Anthony Hopkins for allowing himself to be part of such a piece of garbage.  What worked about Silence of the Lambs was the viewer's wish for Jodie Foster to catch Buffalo Bill.  In this one, I didn't like any of the characters and wanted to see EVERYONE (except maybe Agent Starling--who I wished would just go home) eaten by the pigs.  It lacked the psychological dialog between Hannibal and Clarice that was so vital to Silence of the Lambs.  The only point of Hannibal was that he's a sophisticated person who also likes to kill people. There were no surprises, no chills, no screams, and no excitement.  Boring and stupid was all this movie was about.",Hannibal
891,Sax6937,I really wish I could have liked it...,2,10 February 2001,"When I first heard that Thomas Harris was writing a sequel to ""The Silence of the Lambs"", I was both nervous, and intrigued.  I was intrigued obviously by the fact that you get to find out what happens when Lecter walks off on his way to ""have an old friend for dinner"".  Yet, I was nervous because sequels tend to butcher classics (with the few obvious exceptions...Godfather II, Empire Strikes back...debatable...but you get my point.)Then the casting news came along.  Jodie was a no.  When I heard that, I lost hope.  That is, until I heard that Julianne Moore had signed on.  In my opinion, one of the greatest and most underappreciated actresses in hollywood.  That also holds true for this movie.  She did an excellent job filling in Jodie Foster's shoes, which are some difficult shoes to fill. Anthony Hopkins also did a fine job.  However, I think he got too carried away in his ""craziness"" and forgot about many of the subtlties that made Lecter such a hit in Silence.  As far as acting goes...yes, they were very good performances, but nothing spectacular.What was spectacular, was the scenery.  Everything in Florence.  The art direction, cinematography, and the overall mood conveyed were great; kudos to Ridley Scott for that one!Now for the bad news.  Hans Zimmer, i'm, sorry.  Being a musician, i know how difficult it is to write/perform music, but do not get me wrong.  The music was good. It just did not seem to fit.  At times it sounded like and ER-type TV drama.  Others, it sounded like a romance movie.  But that was not all the fault of the composer.  The script...which never really chose a genre, except EXTRA POINTLESS GORE, is what really needs help.
Dialogue Example: ""What are you doing here Starling?  Writing a book or catching a crook?""Umm...can you say...BLEH??  Seriously.  Also...for those of you that have seen this already, the climax.  When Lecter does ""that thing"" to ""that guy"". Why did he have to do that??  That is what i mean by pointless gore.  It doesnt add anything to the plot, nor does that last scene on the airplane. Again, totally unnecessary.  It seems that every time a suspenseful scene was building...there would be some sort of uncalled for gore or action that would just strike me as...well...stupid.  I have a feeling that these were added merely for the shock value, but for a movie following Silence of the Lambs, the only shock value needed is the intensity of the relationship between Starling and Lecter.As a big fan of Silence of the Lambs, I couldn't wait for this to be released.

It was a very long story that could have been told in about 20 minutes.  Also, if you want to see anything gruesome, you have to wait for the ending of the movie, and if you want to see more gruesome, watch the Silence of the Lambs once again.  Hopkins played his role very well once again, and the Jodie Foster look-a-like did a very good Jodie impression, but it just wasn't as gruesome as it was portrayed by the trailer.

Saying that you have experienced the story after seeing the movie would be like saying that you were truly moved by Shakespeare after reading only the Cliffs Notes.The movie fails to describe Mason Verger as the truly evil person that he is.  Whilst reading the book I felt a decent amount of sympathy for Dr. Lector.  This sympathy was a quite weak in the movie.  I think the five minutes of footage describing the reason for Dr. Lector's psychosis probably should not have been left on the cutting room floor.  Sir Hopkins and Gary Oldman are both amazing actors and I feel they were handcuffed in their portrayal of the characters by the scenes which were chosen to be included in the final release of the film.Let's hope there is an significantly extended version on DVD in the future.,Hannibal

I love the way that they kept a closed set and didn't give away a lot of the meat of the movie in the previews. And I have nothing against violence in movies. Wait... I should qualify that... I have nothing against violence in movies when there is SOME kind of point to it. Maybe the author of Hannibal sat down with some of his/her drinking buddies and said: ""Hey, I've got a bunch of really disgusting ideas. Let's see if we can write a film that could include all of them! Yeah.. I think we could call it 'Hannibal'.

I'm sure that their minds are not consumed only with hatred, anger and thoughts of revenge.I think it's interesting that such a big-budget production could get away with making a mass-murdering cannibal (who happens to enjoy chianti and has a flippant wit) such a sympathetic character.

Do to the quality of its predecessors, how could it possibly measure up?  Well, it doesn't.  Not quite, anyway.  Which is not to say that Hannibal is a bad movie.  It's just like a child in school who's older brother was a prodigy; comparisons will be made, and generally not favorably. The big mistake that Hannibal is that, rather than adapting the book, it condenses it.  Everything you read in the book both there and not there. Scenes are shortened rather than completely lifted out.  It's more like an outline. Another problem (although this is more an opinion) is that it doesn't quite live up to Ridley Scott's visual standards.  Even his darkest movies, like ALIEN and BLADE RUNNER, are absolutely beautiful.  Hannibal is just sort of dirty a desolate.  But, then again, maybe that's what he wanted.",Hannibal

Not only is he a known quantity anyhow, as in any sequel, he appears on camera much more. We are not given the opportunity to anticipate suspense...we are simply witnesses. The movie got me out first day because of 'Silence', and so it may be a box-office success. But genre fans may find themselves enduring a long Florence segment (bearable for some drop-dead 'pretty' shots) and see the 'payoff' zip by quicker than expected.

The performances were fine, however, the script was lame and not nearly as clever as I'm sure David Mamet, Thomas Harris, Ridley Scott et al. intended.  David Mamet should probably stick to writing plays.

You can't help but smile when he says ""Okee-dokee.""  The rest of the cast was quite good as well.  Liotta plays the arrogant Krendler well, and who else but Gary Oldman could bring out Mason Verger from under all that makeup? Giancarlo Giannini also stood out as the doomed Inspector Pazzi.  A few days after I saw the film, a friend asked me the inevitable question: Was Julianne Moore better or worse than Jodie Foster?  My answer: Different.  I don't think it's fair to judge the actress based on another actress's performance ten years earlier.As for the violence of the film, I think many people are overreacting. Yes, some of it is merely violence for violence's sake, but the goriest scenes are done with tongue planted firmly in cheek, in my opinion.  Many times during the film, I found myself thinking, ""I shouldn't be laughing at this."" Hopkins has said that during the filming of the film's finale, he and director Ridley Scott were laughing their asses off.  It's easy to see why. I won't give away the ending, but while it contained the darkest of humor, I found it humorous nonetheless.  All in all, I quite enjoyed the film.  8 out of 10.",Hannibal
903,Julielina,-Hannibal not a disappointment-,7,16 February 2001,"Very Phantom-of-the-Opera-esque. More of a love story than a psychological thriller, and very rewarding in that aspect of the film. If what you were looking for was a repeat of Silence of the Lambs, you'll be disappointed. The psychological manipulation is lacking from Lecter's character, and he is more vulnerable in this movie.  Moore did a wonderful portrayal of Clarice, but I missed Foster.  Overall a good movie, very pleasing and humorous at times.",Hannibal
904,rachelbobby,Better than Silence of the Lambs,10,21 May 2005,"This was even better than the first one. People tend to say it wasn't because it was too graphic. No matter. It was great. I watched it many times and I've watched the credits run over and over and I would like to know if anyone knows the name of the musical piece that was playing at the concert? I know that I've heard it before, but I just can't think of what it is. Anthony Hopkins was at his usual best. Gary Oldman was his usual insane/great. Best scene: Gary Oldman is trying to kill Hannibal with the pigs and it just goes all wrong and then it happens: Cordell,(who is so totally disgusted by this time) throws Mason to the pigs.

905,tommytwin,Hannibal is a masterful synthesis of Red Dragon (Manhunter) and Silence of the Lambs,10,12 February 2001,"Several details from the film Hannibal correlate to parts of Harris' previous two books (and movies) concerning Hannibal Lecter, M.D.  The various pictures related to Hannibal on the wall in the FBI basement where Clarice culled past evidence for clues included a rather grotesque image of a man with several wounds as one might incur from wartime weapons.  This ""war-wounds man"" is the secret to how Hannibal was actually caught and arrested in Red Dragon, relayed by the FBI Agent who apprehended him, Phil Graham.  Graham, on a routine investigation of persons associated with a murdered college girl visited Dr. Lecter, the girl's psychiatrist.  In Lecter's office hung an illustration of war wounds that triggered in Graham's mind memories of a previous unresolved murder case, in which the victim had incurred several of the war-wounds depicted on Lecter's illustration.  As Graham made the mental connection, so did Hannibal.  And before Graham could do much about it, Hannibal 'chloroformed' him, as he did to Krendler, and Pazzi in Hannibal. A disappointing omission from the film Hannibal is a story from Lecter's youth that provides psychological clues to his reasons for cannibalism and serial killing, etc.  Therefore, I highly suggest to anyone who is captivated by the unique 'charm' of Hannibal to read Harris' book of the same name.",Hannibal

Horror movie is a little too much to describe this film",Hannibal
907,Angela-52,"beautiful camera work, scenery and music!!",9,5 May 2003,"A lot has been said about the storyline of this film, and I think it's fair to say you either love it or you hate it. Still, I was a bit disappointed about the fact that not many people have said anything about the mise-en-scene, the beautiful camera work, the scenery and the music in this film. For instance, I was very impressed with the way the city of Florence (Italy) is portrayed in this film as quite a dark, somewhat eerie place, but so beautiful at the same time. Maybe you have to know this city to really appreciate this fact, but I think anyone has to admit the scenery is very impressive. The other thing that really grabbed me is the music, especially the opera scene in Florence, where the ""Vide Cor Meum"" is performed.This opera is based on Dante Alighieri's La Vita Nuova (The New Life), specifically it is based on the sonnet ""A ciascun'alma presa"", in chapter 3 of the Vita Nuova. The music for the Vide Cor Meum is written especially for this film, by Patrick Cassidy, and is produced by Patrick Cassidy and Hans Zimmer. According to the official Hannibal site, Media Ventures liked the piece so much that they encouraged Patrick Cassidy to complete an entire opera around it! I hope this is true, and would love to hear it when it's finished. I guess all I would like to say is, whether you like the storyline or not, maybe you could still try and appreciate other things about it. It takes so much more than just a good story for a film to become a masterpiece!",Hannibal

Even though many did like it,many complained that it is too different from ""Silence of the Lambs"". Now, wouldn't it be boring if would get an exact copy of that movie? Hannibal can stand on its own. What did we really like about Silence so much? For me it were the interesting conversations with Dr.Lecter and then finally his gruesome escape. This is what most people loved about it and now they have it for over 2 hours, so I don't see what they are complaining about. It would receive the praise it deserves if people know what they are getting into: mostly action/suspense with a bit of ""detective work"".

However, as the film progressed, I realized that there was no real substance in 'Hannibal'.  Instead it seemed that Ridley Scott decided to use the ""Shocking"" scenes in the movie as a crutch.  I don't belive you got to the characters portrayed as they richley were in ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Manhunter"".  The movie did not move beyond those scenes, and instead followed the path of movies such as ""I Know What you did Last Summer"" and ""Scream"" by helping set up a money-sucking film franchise. Ultimately I was disappointed with the film...not because I didn't understand...but because I saw it coming a mile away.",Hannibal

His reprise role has said more about him than could any so-called retirement. He aches to act, and act he does... very well. With his presentation of Titus in the picture titled the same, he is able to deliver what he so eagerly gives us in Hannibal, i.e., a desire to pay him attention when he is on-screen.",Hannibal
912,lcgarbage,"Entertaining but falls far short of ""Silence""",6,16 February 2001,"""The Silence of the Lambs"" is my favorite movie ever.  Needless to say, I was anxiously awaiting Thomas Harris' ""Hannibal"" when the book came out a couple years ago.  Unfortunately, it was one of the biggest disappointments ever.  The story was silly.  The ending was unquestionably idiotic.  Harris sold Clarice Starling down the river.  After reading that book, my enthusiasm for a ""Silence"" sequel was next to nothing.But, despite my reservations, I went to see the new movie ""Hannibal"" on its opening weekend, and I have to admit I enjoyed it far more than I ever thought I would.  It's not that it's a great movie.  But it is entertaining and engaging.Ridley Scott's direction and the cinematography are terrific.  This movie LOOKS very good.  The performances are very good all around.  As many have said, Anthony Hopkins is brilliant.  He's quickly becoming a national treasure.  (He became a US citizen recently.)  Julianne Moore does a fine job filling the difficult-to-fill shoes of Jodie Foster.  The ending is slightly more palatable than the book's (sorry, bad pun), but it's still a little silly.Now for the negatives:Moore, as good as she is, just isn't Clarice.  There were scenes where I found myself wishing Foster was there.  The few exchanges between Lecter and Clarice would have been so much more interesting.  This isn't Moore's fault, but what can I say?There are lots of problems with this film (ridiculous plot, a less forboding Lecter, etc.).  But those problems are problems with the source material, not the people who made this movie.  I believe they did as good a job making ""Hannibal"" into an entertaining movie as they could, considering the book they were working with.In summary, ""Hannibal"" is a fun night out at the movies (if you don't mind some serious gore), but it isn't art.  It lacks the intelligence, psychological mindgames, and resonance of ""Silence.""  No wonder Jodie bowed out.(6.5 out of 10)",Hannibal

The sequel was not at all like the first and that was a partial disappointment.'Silence' was filled with suspense and surprise; it teases us like a sensuous woman, whereas 'Hannibal' takes it all off like pure porn.
The sights are disturbing- another indication that it is doing it's job, however, many people won't expect this and will feel cheated if they are expecting to see something a little more like 'Silence'.

The writers this time, gave Lecter a softer side. He almost seemed likable, except for the fear of him killing and then eating you.  Julianne Moore played Clarice almost as well as Jodie Foster played her 10 years ago.  What I didn't like was that they showed you every single piece of gore and blood in the film.  Chances are that the movie would be just as popular if they didn't happen to show some of the horrors of Lecter's work.  I rarely get a sick feeling in my stomach from a movie, but I did after seeing this film.  If a film affects your body as well as your mind, it has done a good job.",Hannibal

It's just as superb as the first and definately worth watching!",Hannibal
923,Charity-10,Much better than critical reviewers would have you think,9,12 February 2001,"Hannibal Lecter is definitely the antihero in this sequel to Silence of the Lambs. It's true that because of that, it's not really possible to feel emotional attachment to any of the characters. But I found that left me open to just sit, watch, and see where the script and director would take me. The result was a very low-key foreshadowing, a glimpse into the ""logic"" of a psychopath. It's clear which characters in the film will come to a bad end, because we can understand why, to Lecter, they deserve what they get. The surprise and the shock is in the details.The gore is no worse than many other popular horror movies, and the worst scenes were well edited, so that we only have to see brief glimpses. In contrast to these, the camera lingers on Mason's face, and on the anatomy in the final sequence of the movie (which you probably already know about if you've read any critical reviews... someone should make professional movie critics adhere to IMDb's ""warn about spoilers"" rule!). These, especially the lighting of Mason's face at the beginning of the movie, remind me of Stephen King's approach to horror - assault the audience with something horrible and shocking, don't let them get away from it, and soon they'll accept the horrible. I found myself thinking ""ok, this guy's face is pretty bad, but THIS isn't the real horror, so how much worse will THAT be?""Julianne Moore's performance is excellent, and her accent dead-on. Unlike many an acclaimed actor, Anthony Hopkins IS Hannibal Lecter for this movie... he's not ""Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter"". I have to admit I wasn't impressed by Mason's character... he seemed a B-movie villain, useful only to provide the plot and make Lecter seem more normal by comparison. When I belatedly found out Gary Oldman played the role, I understand why certain lines of his seemed to transcend his over-the-top character. This is another fantastic actor, doing his best with regrettably little to work with.Camera angles, lighting, and the score are all put together well throughout the movie, but I was especially impressed with the effect of the outdoor lighting and Moore's dress in her final scene. Director Ridley Scott gives us all the tools we need to appreciate the plot twists, rather than bludgeoning us with them.Bloody? Yes. Shocking? A bit. Funny? Surprisingly, yes. As good as Silence of the Lambs? Critically, probably not. Worth seeing? Definitely.",Hannibal

(as they did in Gladiator) I thought I would really miss Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling, but Julianne Moore held more than her own in her dynamic performance. The roll suited her well, and I don't think Jodie could've filled out that gorgeous black dress! All in all, Hannibal is not for the weak stomached, but a masterpiece in itself all the same.

I don't know if the film lost through the translation to German, but most of the dialogues were somewhere between ridiculous and unnecessary. Add a Clarice Starling that in my opinion was acted not all convincing, most of the anticipation had been replaced with disappointment after the introduction. By far the worst part of the film for me was the course of the story in the first 30 to 40 minutes. I don't want to spoil any details if you haven't seen it yet, but there is no logic in it all. I don't know what the author thought about the possibility of several coincidences, but they could have replaced the first part of the film with Starling and Hannibal meeting in the Australian Outback by chance without getting any more unrealistic. In the latter parts of the film they mix in some scenes of ultra extreme and very pointless violence without any meaning to the development of the characters or the story. I left the film early, but I'm sure my idea of the ending is very close to what really happened. Definitely a movie I would recommend NOT to watch...",Hannibal

It missed, though, and here's why.First off, while the performance of Anthony Hopkins is undeniably Grade A, as usual, he just doesn't come off as a believable Dr.Lecter anymore. While he still possesses an aura of dangerousness in the role, Hopkins has gotten too pudgy and grandpa-ish to pull off something like, say, the ""tongue thing"" from ""Lambs"".  He doesn't try to, mind you, but that's still a double-edged sword.  Like I said, his performance is great, as is Julianne Moore's, who, let me say, I did buy as Clarice Starling.  That would usually suffice for a film, but, being the sequel to ""The Silence of the Lambs"", it doesn't here.Gary Oldman's makeup is superb.  I actually forgot he was in the film until I saw his name in the ending credits.  The entire ""brain scene"" with Ray Liotta, however, is a different story.  It looks more like something that would be in ""Friday the 13th, Part 8"", not the sequel to ""Silence of the Lambs"".  The gore in the film was stylish and very well done up to that point, but that was just plain cheesy to me.I guess there's just no getting around it.  Even the amazing camera work can't put it on par with the first film.  If it weren't the sequel to ""Silence of the Lambs"", I would say it was a good film.  It is the sequel to ""Silence of the Lambs"", though, and because of that, it's just not good enough.  After much deliberation, I give it 5 stars on a scale from one to ten.",Hannibal

He was chilling and truly evil and yet at the same time you cant help rooting for him.  The plot was admittedly a bit slow at times but it was all relevant, necessary and dripping with atmosphere as you might expect from one of Ridley Scotts films.  Anyone who has read the book should be doubly impressed with how it was converted into a film.

I must say that the role of Mason Verger was a little 'comic', but he was still such a side character, that it didn't take anything away from the movie. I don't understand why the people say this is the goriest movie in a while. There isn't that much of it. And it's done very artistically. I have no doubt that Hopkins will receive an Academy Award next year....",Hannibal
932,mpost663,"Not terrible, but very disappointing.",5,10 February 2001,"Anthony Hopkins once again sinks his teeth into his Oscar-winning role of Dr. Hannibal Lector in ""Hannibal,"" the long-awaited sequel to 1991's ""The Silence of the Lambs.""Based on the novel of the same name by Thomas Harris, the film picks up the story ten years after now FBI Special Agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore) -- with the help of the mad doctor -- closed the infamous case of serial killer Buffalo Bill.  Lifted to a certain degree of celebrity afterwards, Starling has worked her way through a distinguished career until her job is placed in jeopardy thanks to another officer disobeying an order during a botched arrest attempt.Facing suspension and possibly the end of her career, Starling is rescued by her first case when the only surviving victim of Lector's (played by an unbilled Gary Oldman under an excellent makeup job) contacts the FBI with new information on his current location.  Starling buries her feelings of betrayal deep as she is given the opportunity to ""redeem"" herself by investigating the possible whereabouts of the cannibalistic doctor.  She accepts the case after being pushed to by her FBI superiors and a big wig from the Justice Department (annoyingly played by Ray Liotta) who Starling was once briefly involved with.Moore has been handed the unenviable task of replacing Jodie Foster in the role she made famous.  Foster passed on reprising her Oscar-winning role after reading the Harris novel and deemed it too gruesome.  In all fairness, there is nothing wrong with Moore's performance.  Starling's eager innocence tempered with ambition is gone, replaced with a hardness that nearly makes her unsympathetic.  It is impossible to picture Foster playing this version of Starling.  They are almost two different characters.This is not entirely the fault of Moore who is obviously only playing what she was given by the film's writers David Mamet and Steven Zaillian. Starling is reduced to nothing more than a supporting character during the first 90 minutes.  The script is filled with inconsistencies and predictability as it sputters badly.  Just when you think it's about to get going it stops again as it gets bogged down repeatedly by dull police procedures and a needless and distracting subplot involving an Italian police officer's attempts to capture Lector for a reward.The faulty characterization is not limited to just Starling.  Lector himself is given a new side to his personality that never even seemed imaginable before: he's boring.  Having settled nicely into his new life as a temporary art curator in Europe, Lector gives dull lectures on various pieces of art while dodging unspoken insinuations that he may have been involved in the death of his predecessor and attending operas.In the original ""Lambs,"" Lector's dialogue and attitude alluded repeatedly to his culture and sophistication.  For over an hour, this is all we see. A sophisticated gentleman with only the occasional hint of evil that we know lives within him.  With no one worthy to bounce it off, the spark that made Lector such a vivid and eerily charming character is gone.  Hopkins is fine in a role no one else could ever play.  It is just that, like Moore, he is not given much to work with.There is no denying that director Ridley Scott -- an expected Oscar nominee for last summer's ""Gladiator"" -- has made a stylish and atmospheric film, but this is more of a hindrance than a help.  Scott uses his skills not to enhance the intensity as ""Lambs"" director Jonathan Demme (who also won an Oscar) did in the original, but to replace it.  The film is barren of any real thrills relying instead on an overabundance of gore.  Where the original used the intense tête-à-têtes between Starling and Lector as its center and simply implied the gore, ""Hannibal"" uses blood and guts and lots of it, especially in its nauseating finale.""Hannibal"" is not a horrible movie, just a severely disappointing one.  The unsatisfying ending (drastically changed from the book in an attempt to lure Foster back as Starling) feels more like a gateway to a third and final confrontation than a conclusion.  Perhaps the Starling vs. Lector manhunt promised at the end of ""Lambs"" will finally come to fruition.",Hannibal

Unfortunately, it became a losing battle.  Sir Anthony Hopkins gave us a good, but not great, Dr. Lecter, and the rest of the characters ran the gamut from plastic to laughable.  I could see no evidence of significant development in any of the major characters.  There was little if any of the original movie's cleverness, sinister tone, suspense, or even of the way it reveled in evil. This movie stumbled along, at times through the requisite buckets of gore and horrified expressions, to an almost comic and certainly unbelievable ending.  In the face of such acting talents as Hopkins, Moore, Ray Liotta, and Giancarlo Giannini, this was a mighty disappointment.",Hannibal

Dont go to the theateres expecting another Silence of The Lambs because this film is completely different and just as good if not better than Silence.",Hannibal
935,maggie72,"Great performances, boring movie",3,11 February 2001,"The performances in this movie, including the addition of Julianne Moore as Clarice are fabulous.  The movie looks spectacular.  But I have to say it was one of the most boring movies I have ever seen, despite the gore.  The plot was so inane.  I can't believe that a seasoned FBI agent would be so stupid as to handcuff herself to a cannibal in a kitchen full of knives. There was no suspense, since no one was really chasing anyone.  It was all so contrived.  Don't bother unless it is for free.",Hannibal
936,tao_dragon-2,A disappointing sequel to Silence of the Lambs,6,14 February 2001,"Granted, ""Hannibal"" certainly has its moments. Anthony Hopkins is excellent in his portrayal of Hannibal Lecter, the charming psychiatrist with some very dark extra-curricular activities. However, despite his noble attempt to carry the film, ""Hannibal"" ultimately seems to be reaching -- desperately -- for the same praise and fame that was showered upon Silence of the Lambs. In doing so, it resorts to over-the-top, ridiculous gore, and contrived suspense. Furthermore, the casting of Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling is ill-conceived, at best. She portrays none of the multi-layered personality that made Jodie Foster's performance so memorable and realistic. Perhaps worst of all, the makers of ""Hannibal"" apparently lacked the courage necessary to create a film as intense as ""Silence of the Lambs,"" and instead peppered ""Hannibal"" with forced humor and campy dialogue.On its own merits, ""Hannibal"" qualifies as a slightly-better-than-average horror flick. As a sequel, though, it succeeds only in  destroying the wonderfully-realistic characters that made ""Silence of the Lambs"" such a masterpiece.",Hannibal
937,mookiemets,Made good book into an awful movie,4,10 February 2001,"This movie takes a very good book by Thomas Harris, and turns it into one of the must disappointing movies in a long time. After having to wait 10 years for Hannibal Lecter to return, we are treated to a poor attempt of turning ""Hannibal"", the novel into a movie.",Hannibal
938,justsomemoviefan,excellent performances make Hannibal a worthwhile excursion for casual fans and serious cinophiles,9,11 February 2001,"Giancarlo Giannini has a weighty role in ""Hannibal,"" portraying an ambitious Italian inspector seeking to capture the title character.  He's not Julianne Moore, or even Ray Liotta...that is, he's not an actor most of us US folk might be familiar with.  With that said, though, Giannini carries a sizeable portion of the film, keeping the audience engaged and building the film's suspense.I start with Giannini because the strength of ""Hannibal"" lies in the acting, in my humble opinion.  The writing is very strong, too, but some of the humor seems forced and some of the characterizations are a bit off, as well.While there are powerful allegories about avarice and redemption in the film, the writers overemphasize the ""good ol' boy"" nature of the FBI and the gender politics that thwart Clarice Starling's success...perhaps for some viewers, this effort helps define the character and make it easier to accept Julianne Moore in the role.Julianne Moore does just fine on her own, though.  She exquisitely portrays Clarice Starling as grace under pressure in the film's action sequences and is alternately tough-as-nails/I'm-done-with-this-sexist-crap in her scenes with Starling's sexist higher-ups.  Moore provides a full, textured performance that is as deserving of recognition as Jodie Foster's Oscar turn in the same role.Anthony Hopkins stretches his part of the screenplay to its full potential. He's not always given the best material, unfortunately; his final encounter with Moore's Clarice, for example, is very tough work for an actor, but Hopkins pulls it off with such elan and aploomb that more serious film fans are forgiving of the forced nature of the script.Also very good are Gary Oldman (he and Giancarlo Giannini may BOTH score Academy Award nominations for thier work here...) and Ray Liotta.
So, in short, despite some narrative flaws and dialouge that occasionally falls rather flat (""Hannibal the Cannibal"" saying ""Okey-Dokey""?), ""Hannibal"" still works thanks to the acting ensemble.",Hannibal
939,joefire-2,Anthony Hopkins Has a Little Fun,7,11 February 2001,"Geez, where do I begin.  I've already read so much about the arrival of the film and so many of the reviews of the film that it's pretty difficult to address many of the critisisms the flick has received.Hannibal is being talked down by people all over the country and frankly, I just don't get it.  My speculation is that those people who are talking it down didn't read the book.  Why is this an important issue?  Well, honestly, the book had MAJOR PROBLEMS!I can't say that I enjoyed Hannibal as much as ""...lambs"", but then I'm not sure that this would have been possible.  It has been 10 years since the first movie and a lot has changed in cinema since the first release.  That said, the issues I had with the movie I could relate back to the director's attempt to be true to the novel.  I appreciate that he didn't throw the whole book right out the window and start fresh, though, perhaps, doing so would have been the only way to appease his harshest critics.In the end the movie is GREAT - not good, but GREAT ENTERTAINMENT!  Anthony Hopkins, back in what has to be considered his career defining role, gives up a LECTER who - after 10 years of outsmarting EVERYBODY is looking to have some fun.  And boy, does he ever have fun!  Here's a guy who fears nothing and loves only one thing - the thrill; the chase - oh, and the FBI (or, at least, a certain FBI agent).A year from now I look forward to watching both movies back to back on my DVD player.  Meanwhile I encourage you all to take this one in.  No, it's not a ""creepy"" as the first.  But it is, for lack of a better phrase, a heck of a lot of fun!joefire",Hannibal

I saw yesterday evening in the theater and I'm still thrilled!It's simply the most exciting and raffined serial-killer-movie in the world! The actual plot could have been a little better, but the completely perfect acting by, especially, Anthony Hopkins makes the plot go in second line. If Anthony doesn't deserve an Oscar for this performance, no one does! I give 11points out of 10! Julianne Moore is excellent, but I believe Jodie Foster would have been better!

941,jbergman-5,Hannibal does a hacking job to Clarice!!,7,10 February 2001,"Hannibal, just didnt have near the spark or feeling Silence of the Lambs did.  Before I get to why it didn't or what was wrong with the film I will say what was right with the film.  It did have Anthony Hopkins and he once again gave us a powerhouse performance as everyone's favorite Cannibal, Dr. Hannibal Lecter.  It also had some scary and tense scenes and also some great scenery shots of the beautiful Florence, Italy.   But that is pretty much it.Why i didnt enjoy Hannibal is probably why everyone else didn't enjoy it and that was the story line.  It did give us a better view of Dr. Lecter but it wasn't wrote for Clarice Starling.  The story line and picture didn't have the feeling the Lambs did.  And also this was partly due to Julianne Moore. I didn't feel she did that great of a job as Clarice maybe because I felt Jodie played the part perfectly and also I feel the story didnt do justification for the character of Clarice Starling.  Also, the ending and a few other parts in the movie made me laugh because it was so outrageous and silly.  The very last scene especially, GIVE ME A BREAK.  These characters weren't meant to laugh at.  I didn't laugh once when I saw Silence of the Lambs and i wasn't expecting to laugh in this one but i did and that bothered me because it took away from the feeling and from the characters. All in all i didn't enjoy the movie.  It was worth the price of admission and is probably better than any horror or suspense movie you are going to see this year but it didn't do justification to Silence of the Lambs.",Hannibal

At this point I should also point out that ACE-122 claimed that Hannibal was taken off the 10 Most Wanted - only to mysteriously reappear - Verger insisted that he reappear - this is not a mistake in the movie - even on first viewing this is obvious ...*** END SPOILER ***so basically the 3 major plot points were spoiled - and its very hard to enjoy a movie under those conditions...However, what makes me think that the movie was bad are : lack of plot, lack of character development, a lack of suspense, and a rather obscene idea that its ok to be a serial killer as long as you kill bad people. Was that the message of the film or was its message lost on me?As a movie its ok - but Hannibal comes off as far less threatening; Silence implied alot of things about Hannibal, and once you see him knock off a few people, you start to think that he's just another killer, not really a serial killer.The acting is fine, though some of the characters are not fully developed. The real problem with this movie is that it is predictable.",Hannibal

Although a sequel it truly delves into the mind of Hannibal Lecter and truly shows what makes him tick.  The haunting score by Hans Zimmer is fantastic, as well as the direction of Ridley Scott, and cinematography of John Mathieson.  The performances live up to expectations with Moore showing she has what it takes to fill the shoes of Foster, and Hopkins pulling off another unbelievable performance as Lecter.  Truly a dark masterpiece that should be embraced as much as its predecessor.",Hannibal

Hannibal was a typical cheese horror flick that lowered itself into the classes of I Know What You Did Last Summer, Urban Legends, etc., etc..

946,Steve Oldham,"Not as good as ""Lambs"", but still an engaging experience",8,15 February 2001,"The first thing which should be noted is that ""Hannibal"" is NOT as good as ""The Silence Of The Lambs"". However, this is not entirely the fault of the filmmakers, as the third book in the trilogy is by far the worst. Instead of attempting to emmulate the success of the brilliant ""Lambs"", Ridley Scott takes his film in another direction, aiming more for black comedy than the tense psychological thriller that was this film's Oscar winning predeccesor. This angle, on the whole, works, although many will be disappointed, in particular with the violence of the ending, which is an unsatisfactory conclusion to an otherwise good film. There are plenty of gruesome moments, but none are unneccesary. Other problems include the make-up of new 'bad guy' Mason Verger, played by an unrecognisable Gary Oldman. The disfigured face of Verger should not be shown until the end of the film, and while the make-up is not bad, showing Oldman in the first scene spoils any sense of terror which could be drawn from the villain's evil visage. On the positive side, both Moore and Hopkins are fantastic, and Scott's direction is, on the whole, engaging. The final scene following the gruesome encounter is a gem, and while the film may be too gruesome for some, it is both entertaining and funny, and definitely worth a look.",Hannibal

Not once did I feel for any of its characters and the suspense I've been craving since ""Silence,"" has remained unsatisfied.It starts off desperately trying to make you forget Jodie Foster, by pushing Julianna Moore on you as Clarice, and judging by this performance, she is absolutely a mediocre talent at best. Certainly not worthy of a headliner.Hopkins was true to form, as well as Gary Oldman, but neither of them could save this awful script.  It was as if a 1/2 hour TV episode was stretched to fill 4 hours and minus any good suspense a TV episode would have.As great as Ridley Scott's work was on Gladiator, he should absolutely be ashamed of the boring nonsense he pulled with this one.I found myself waiting for something...anything to happen.This is very hard to admit being a Hopkins & Oldman Fan, but, Hannibal, is truly not worthy of your time or money.  I am sure this will be #1 on the box office this week, but that will not change the fact that Hannibal is Horrible.   I simply cannot recommend this movie in good conscience.If suspense is what you crave, seek elsewhere or watch ""Silence of the Lambs"" again",Hannibal
948,jandretti,Dumb,4,27 August 2001,This movie did not have the the character development or intrigue as the first. The characters from Mason (millionaire wanting revenge against Hannibal) to Ray Liotta characters lacked thought and are nothing but cookie cutter roles added to progress the dumb storyline. Hopkins and Moore do a decent job in the script that they were given. I can see why Jodie Foster turned down the role. Gore is added to this film for entertainment value and shock value.,Hannibal

The first hour of the movie is wasted on a story line that has little or nothing to do with the overall story.  There is absolutely no suspense to this movie.  It has long periods where absolutely nothing happens and by the end you just can't wait for it to be over.  Speaking of the ending...it is almost ridiculous.  This movie(such an obvious setup for a second sequel) is almost bad enough to make you forget how good the original was.  If not for the acting, I wouldn't even give this movie a 2.  Ten years and this is the best they could do.  Disappointing.",Hannibal
950,yurig96,A silly studio mistake breaks the Silence,2,18 February 2001,"SPOILER ALERT The film is a bit overlong, nothing actually happens to make it worth the time, there are no great revelations (what subtle shades of character development that are made in The Silence of the Lambs are blown up and drawn in garrish technocolor here).Hannibal annoys me in a way similar to how I was annoyed by the absolutely unsatisfying X-Men. To certain degrees the movies are similar, both have interesting characters, interesting moral and social questions, and decent enough budgets to be fully explored. Both movies lacked proper character development, rational motivation, conflict, satisfactory revolutions. You enter and leave both films without knowing anything more about the characters than when you entered. When the plot is forgetful, as it is in both cases, then this is the death's head of all critical arguement.So how does Hannibal look? Well I plucked in my dvd of the Silence of the Lambs and turned on the commentary track. Silence is by Stop Making Sense director Demme while Hannibal is from future Academy Award Winner Ridley Scott. Silence looks much more like an episode of the X-Files. This really surprised me, but then I started to see the obvious parallels. I will say in all honesty that I do not think that there would be a series called the X-Files had Chris Carter not seen this movie because there are some very conspicuous similarities.That said, Silence and the X-Files probably have a certain feel of realism that Hannibal sadly lacks.  It is not enough that Hannibal takes place in some of the most visually interesting locations imaginable, no Scott has to waste his environments. Silence was shot on a much cheaper budget which makes its cinema verite style all the more essential for presenting its very gruesome subject matter. Hannibal tries to take Hopkins' Lector and portray it as artistry. Unfortunately he neither treats the cinematography nor the subject matter with a delicate brush. Instead he paints an ugly picture with such broad brushstrokes that he leaves us with little more than an overpriced lampoon of this film's predecessor. Hannibal turns into a bogeyman and cultural elitist, his love for Clarice draws him to cut off his hand to save her and himself (perhaps this is trying to prove to us that since she wouldn't become Lector's protege that he had lost his right hand?).I have seen episodes of bewitched which carry more plot weight which surprised me to see the reaction of the moviegoers that surrounded us in the theatre. Most of them were satisfied with the movie, more still enjoyed the obvious twists and turns of the barely present plot. As far as violence is concerned, don't be fooled. Hannibal is no more violent than an episode of Ren & Stimpy. Either Lector's calculated acts of violence are carried out through montage camerawork that remind of us of a bad Oliver Stone, or as it is in the finale, the climactic brain cooking sequence is both cartoonish and fake. Ray Liotta plays a character that has as much redeeming value as J. Phoenix in Gladiator so when Lector does take the vivesector to his brain our reaction is neither grossed out or shocked. But instead I am reminded of seeing the cripple Franklin as he opens the Tobe Hooper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Like Franklin, for whom we feel no pity for throughout the film, Scott is just p***ing into a can. I hope Scott remembers that when the Academy hands him his trophy. He should be glad that he is competing against the Van Sants, the Camerons, and the Ang Lees. Because he sure as stuff couldn't hold bed pans of the Powells, Pressburgers, Kurosawas, or Bunuels.",Hannibal
951,TJGB,Beautifully filmed; incredibly dull,3,11 March 2001,"I have to say I really wasn't bothered about seeing this movie. After Hopkins' hypocrisy of condemning his playing of Hannibal and violence in movies generally after Silence of the Lambs I could only sense a big fat cheque luring him back to the screen.However, many of my friends reckoned it was worth watching. It wasn't. The movie has no plot and no tension. The main characters are brought back for a sequel for no other obvious reason than that they were popular before so that automatically gives them some modicum of script immunity. I think it's important to remember that Lector was only the back plot of the previous two movies in the series and he isn't good enough to carry the movie like this.The movie is also not particularly gory, barring the final sequence. People who tell you otherwise obviously never saw the Indiana Jones trilogy.I was tempted to say the only good things here are Hopkins and Ridley Scott but then realised that Hopkins wasn't actually required to do any acting: he plays an emotionless character who is never sad, surprised, in love or even particularly happy.All we are left with are some black humoured quips that we've all heard a dozen times before in the Bond movies, and a demonstration of Scott's filming techniques - which we've already seen in his better movies.Pointless.",Hannibal

Each movie should be deemed worthy based on it's own merit.  Julianne did not replace Jodie well at all-it only made me wish I was watching 'Silence' again.  However, she was a really good actress and played her part well. I was worried that it would be all gore and leave me with a constant feeling of eerieness.  It didn't though, and I really enjoyed it.  The story line was really good (having not read the book I cannot compare the two) and unless you would be sick at the sight of eating flesh, I believe anyone would enjoy it.  I would like to add, though, that if you liked Manhunter, you probably did not like Silence of the Lambs and definitely would not like Hannibal. The last two are completely different and I would have to say do not really appeal to the same audience.  I definitely would recommend this movie-and ladies, if your man wants to see it (and you have a fairly strong stomach) then by all means take them.

The negativity toward it (I read four pans today) stems from critics wanting to relive the tone of ""Lambs."" The novel never promised that, and Ridley Scott's film follows the book very well (save the pointless new ending). Sir Anthony gives his most brilliant perf since ""Remains of the Day,"" and Julianne Moore and Ray Liotta (I'm an 'anti-fan' of both) were surprisingly very, very good. If you take an open mind to your local cineplex, you might be very surprised. Soak in the amazing art/set direction, the seamless, artistic editing (JFK's Pietro Scalia has quite a style) and --uh--visceral effects.

956,johnny_lawless,"good, but not great. The mystique is gone",7,9 February 2001,"Having read the book first has probably spoiled me regarding the film. Half the characters have been removed or relegated, and most of the backstory is thrown away. Also the absence of many characters and events (such as the old prison sequence, as well as Diane Baker and Spike Jonze, although I can't confirm the latter). Gary Oldman as usual was spectacular, if unrecognizable under horrific make-up, and Hopkins was good. In the cinema I was in a lot of people were laughing, especially during the end sequence. Granted there are a few scenes with a wry sense of humour, but on the whole there seemed to be perhaps too much laughter, although that may speak more of the audience than of the film itself. Julianne Moore is a passable Starling, but, rightly so, this is not Clarice's movie, it is Hannibal's. But having Hopkins on screen for so long does ruin the mystique somewhat; it is nothing like seeing him behind the glass in SOTL. And the ending does become something of a mess.

I had many questions coming into this movie a lot of them were about Hannibal, and why does it kill and if Hannibal loves Clarice and does she love him back.I won't tell the answers, but I have to say, I loved the movie, and it was better than I thought it was going to be.  I loved Silence of the Lambs, because of the relationship between Clarice and Hannibal. Some say that the relationship isn't as strong now because of it not being Foster and Hopkins. I think the relationship was played perfectly because of the fact that they have been separated for ten years, and people change.I have to remind everyone that the director has even said this isn't really a horror movie. I think it is a story about Hannibal, and I wanted it told. I am grateful that the story of Hannibal is finally being told.

The protagonists drive the story with such skill that there is no doubt of their superior intellect.  Everyone else is a pawn for the final outcome, where the Starling-Lecter conflict finally occurs, 10 years later as time runs out.  Scott has masterfully directed ""Hannibal"" and has used the mystery and command of one of the best characters ever written for book and film and has driven a whole successful and entertaining plot through the heart of a psychotic killer; the result is gruesome and perverse enjoyment and you you only wish things could be simple and rational..

I read both books and reading the stories are even better still. You find out about characters (and endings) they wrote out of the movie. This one is a lot more grotesque than SOTL. The audience really reacted to the movie like I have never seen before. I heard some wanted to leave because they found it too gross.

Yeah, it gets a little slow at times and the characters aren't really well developed. But, what do you expect? This is not a psychological thriller. This is a rather inspired horror/comedy. It's not particularly frightening. But when it works, it works. The scenes that are supposed to be disturbing, ARE disturbing. And that's what we want, right? I was shocked a few times. I also laughed, gasped, and generally had a good time.So, give ""Hannibal"" a break. Ridley Scott, et al., have given audiences a slick, well crafted popcorn movie. Leave SOTL alone.

965,UnionSpyGlass,"Okey-Dokey, here we go!",10,10 February 2001,"WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!!! (BUT WILL TRY NOT TO!)First, being an avid fan of Silence of the Lambs, I must note that I walked into Hannibal fully aware of the fact that it might not meet my expectations.  Yet from the first scene of Julianne Moore/ Clarice Starling confronting the police officers, to Florence and the indominible Anthony Hopkins/ Dr. Fell/ Hannibal Lecter, I was hooked.Of course, the camera work was excellent -- without compare.  Even the sparse, prison-like scenes from SOTL could not compare with the rich diversity and the elegant touches of Florence.  But the best scenes were the cat-and-mouse scenes in the Washington Station in D.C.  Hannibal leading Clarice along, toying with her, not quite close enough to touch but closer than she realized -- those scenes still stand out in my mind.POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT!!! My one problem was with the end of the movie.  If the script writers (and I understand there were multiple -- three -- different scripts written for this movie) were going to build in an obsession on Hannibal's part towards Clarice, I would perhaps have liked to see it better developed in the end of the movie.  A lot was missing in the final minutes of interaction.  I won't go into detail, but Hannibal's sacrifice for Clarice was touching -- enhancing the love story that was tried and rejected as a subplot for the movie.  I for one don't think the movie would have been ruined by drifting along those lines towards a relationship between Starling and Lecter.  All the indicators point towards it.  And yet the end of the movie feels rushed, as though the director were afraid he was losing the audience's interest. I could have sat for a lot longer if it had meant a satisfactory denouement -- but the way the movie ended did have it's touching side.  I recommend this movie for anyone who likes action, drama, horror, and even romance.  I can't wait to see it again.",Hannibal
966,arthur1288,"Missing the ""Silence""",3,10 February 2001,"Like a lot of fans of ""Silence of the Lambs"", I, too, had waited desperately these ten years for a sequel.  What set ""Silence"" apart from most other films were the chances it took, and I knew that if a sequel was going to be any good, the creators needed to again take chances.It seems the people behind ""Hannibal"" took no chances.  ""Silence"" was the first of it's kind, and has inspired a new genre in film.  In the intervening ten years, we have seen filmmakers follow ""Silence's"" lead (""Seven"" probably ranking best, ""Desperate Measures"" the worst).  The problem with being a leader is that followers usually try to duplicate the flash, the skin, of the original, and forget the heart of it.  The heart of ""Silence"" was it's subtext: Starling trying to heal the traumas of her childhood.Imitators typically lack the necessary subtext.  They usually focus solely on creating a chatty, charismatic villain.  ""Hannibal"" is another pale imitation in that line.I hadn't been able to wait, and had read the book ahead of time.  The book was curious and disturbing, and cast more light on an interesting character and his world.  The book had a downbeat ending, but made sense if reports were true that the author intended it to be act 2 in a trilogy.  I knew it couldn't be sold as is, and wasn't surprised when Foster dropped out.  I was still mystified how they would capture the heart of the book on the screen.They didn't even bother.  The book, to me, was about the search for family, history, home.  The movie is a different creature entirely.  True to imitator fashion, they only paid attention to the gorey detail, leaving the core of the piece out.  They gutted out most of the main character's motivations, leaving only puppets to serve in their place.  That's not Starling up there, nor Mason Verger, or even Hannibal, for that matter. Without ""Silence,"" I wouldn't know who these people were;there's no charm to them, or the movie.If you liked the first movie because of its ""creepiness"" then you might like this latest offering after all.  However, I loved ""Silence"" because it dealt with communication--or lack of it--between two very different characters searching for a connection with themselves and their world--and in the midst of it all, they connect with each other.I was hoping for that same magic in ""Hannibal.""  I was hoping to see the evolution in Starling's character.  In the first movie she was trying to escape her past.  In the book, ""Hannibal,"" Harris explained why Starling chose the FBI to escape TO; and why the FBI eventually became a poor choice for her, not giving her the true satisfaction and pride she hoped it would. Also, I hoped to see ""Hannibal's"" inner world; that was the most attractive part of the book, as disturbing as it sounds.  He was such a charismatic part of the first movie because the mystery of his character drew viewers to him.  I was hoping to see this inner world and what made him make the choices he made, just as we learn in ""Silence"" why Starling made her choices.""Silence,"" too gave its secondary characters a life.  In ""Silence"" Crawford is a father figure for Clarice.  In the book ""Hannibal,"" Mason Verger is a nemesis for Lector and Verger's evil far surpasses Hannibal's, so that the reader/viewer understands why Hannibal begins to take on human qualities--why Starling was able to connect with Hannibal at all.  In this recent movie Verger is reduced to a pathetic plot device to help Starling and Hannibal's paths to cross again.I may have had higher expectations than I should have had, considering the drop out of Foster and Demme, the numerous script changes, and the hoopla surrounding the film.  But I hoped--I hoped that somehow ""Hannibal"" would not only recapture the magic from ""Silence"" but would build into act II of a story that so obviously has much more to say about not only Starling and Lector's inner demons, but our own inner demons.My verdict:  Read the book.  Save the movie for the dollar theater.",Hannibal
967,kristopher_waddell,Ridley's task,6,13 February 2001,"Ridley Scott had proven twenty years ago that he could create a claustrophobic, skin crawling, thriller with ALIEN.  In HANNIBAL, his second horror/thriller in a long and great career, Ridley chose to make a complete 180 with his vision for ALIEN.  Instead, Ridley takes the audience to numerous, grand locations, who's beauty is jaw dropping.  A clear change from the gritty world of greens and grey's that we saw in Demme's SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. My problem with this change in setting, is that frankly it is not as frightening.  HANNIBAL is a beautiful looking film, though it's subject matter is that of GODZILLA.  We come to the theatre to see the monster. The monster is not contained, so he roams free in the open streets.  Similar to many monster movies, I wasn't so much scared, but excited by the film's campy nature. HANNIBAL has clearly not broken any new ground in the horror genre, or made great leaps in cinematic history, but it is nonetheless a fun circus of freaks.",Hannibal

970,spradling,"SPOILER, WATCH IT! Um... DisapPOINTed!",6,11 February 2001,"I can't even think straight, I'm so disappointed. I've been a lurker here at Loving Lector for weeks, appreciating others' fan fic and counting the days for the movie to open.Having read the trades, I was prepared for C and L not to 'run off together' at the end; we knew that much had been changed. I *wasn't* for both Clarice and Lector AND the C/L relationship to be stripped of all of their most precious properties.Hannibal is robbed of his humanizing memories of Mischa; Starling is robbed of her family memories and her humanizing relationships with Ardelia, Brigham, and Crawford. Lector is robbed of his protective fondess for Clarice; the letter he writes her in the book offers support (""You are a warrior. You can be as strong as you wish to be""). Here only the taunts remain. The ""miele en la lionessa"" is stripped of its beauty (in the book he lovingly buys her sensuous gifts at the Farmacia di Santa Maria Novella and tells her she is the 'honey in the lion' - here it's Mason that writes it as a trick on her). Gone is the nurturing instinct she confesses for him too; the conviction that ""the world would not be this way within the reach of her arm"" that makes her go rescue L - here it's just another aspect of her trying to catch him and win the prize from the Bureau.
Mason is trimmed of his monstrousness; no longer bed-ridden, no longer the torturer of underpriviledged children; no longer Idi Amin's former executioner; no longer the progeny of a corrupt and hideous meat-packing empire. Without any of those defining traits, we feel almost sorry for him.
And Krendler is more annoyance than horrid villian; what happens to him in the end seems cruel and over done. He's good looking (the actor that played Shoeless Joe should not attempt to play sleazy, beneath-contempt Krendler). When his brain gets eaten, Clarice feels sorry for him and so do we.
And of course the final scenes of the book and epilogue are gone in their substance. I couldn't believe my ears and eyes. Clarice becomes Lector's hostage, not his patient. The scene at the refridgerator door accomplishes - what? Anything? Who wrote this dialogue? A Lector who snaps gum and says ""Okey-dokey"", ""Goody-goody"", and ""ta-ta"" WOULD be capable of that crappy ""Would you ever say to me 'Stop.. stop.. if you loved me, you'd stop'"" line.
Clarice is the same ambitious rule-abiding SOTL character only stripped of her potency and intelligence. Lector is like the SOTL Lector on Prozac.
I thought for sure they'd at least keep the Donnie Barber scene in the morgue.",Hannibal
971,suesea45,Messy fast food where there was once a cinematic feast,4,12 February 2001,"This movie greatly increased my respect for Jodie Foster, and correspondingly diminished that which I had felt for Sir Anthony Hopkins. Like ""Multiple-Miggs,"" Hannibal's ill-mannered and doomed neighbor in the exquisite ""Silence of the Lambs,"" ""Hannibal"" splatters the viewer with sights both unpleasant and pointless.I do not take issue with the goriness of this movie per se, but rather with the confused and pointless story, of which the largely-laughable scenes of bloodshed are only a small part. Although I did not read ""Hannibal,"" I have heard that the movie follows the book relatively faithfully, until the final minutes.  If this is so, Thomas Harris should bear the brunt of the criticism, as it is hard to envision how any director, writer, or set of actors could elevate such an ill-conceived set of words and ideas above camp and self-parody.  Thus, I should add  ""Silence""-director Jonathan Demme, who wisely declined to bring ""Hannibal"" to the screen, to Jodie Foster, in listing the people who have enhanced their credibility by just saying ""No"" to bad movies.The Hannibal Lector of the 1991 movie, conscienceless predator that he was, was nonetheless a paragon of cultured refinement and restraint.  His inexplicable desire to consume human flesh, coupled with his fine-tuned aesthetic sensibilities and his unnerving intuitive abilities, all came together in Hopkins' deservedly-Oscar-winning 1991 performance to create a seductive and unforgettable monster.  He was an irreducibly evil force of nature, as disturbingly majestic as he was morally repugnant.  Ten years later, the moral repugnance remains, but the majesty has drained away, leaving little more than a blueblood Freddy Kruger.  While Hopkins does a perfectly respectable job with the execrable material, it is a blasphemy against the gods of Cinema to bring this inferior Lector to the big screen. Though it could be argued that it would have taken a ""Saint"" Hopkins, never mind a ""Sir,"" to pass up the retirement windfall his ""Hannibal"" paycheck will no doubt provide, I shed a tear for the premature passing of my favorite movie villain of all time, done in not by the FBI, Clarice Starling, or Mason Verger, but by poor writing and the triumph of greed over taste.The Hannibal I knew and loved would have killed and eaten this movie, (after extensive seasonings to cover the unpleasant flavors,) then rested secure in the knowledge that he had prevented something nasty and ill-tasting from being rudely flung into our faces.",Hannibal
972,tao15,i feel cheated...,1,12 February 2001,"where 'silence of the lambs' was smart and disturbing on an intellectual level, 'hannibal' relies on cheap parlor tricks. it was truly embarrassing and completely ridiculous. i believe in the beginning i charmed by the beautiful cinematography. it all took a drastic turn when the man-eating boars were introduced and from that point on it became an adventure into the absurd. the plot just became too stupid to ignore. the actors did what they were supposed to do, but the whole premise of the story was just too unbelievable. there was no reason for this movie, it had no point and it should just not even exist. the entire movie was just insulting and assaulting. if you want a psychological thriller rent the original and skip this one. if i could, i would give this movie a big fat zero for the rating.",Hannibal
973,constella,A disappointment - possible spoilers,5,12 February 2001,"This movie was a great disappointment.  I find Julianne Moore to be creepy in any movie in which she stars, and I think she did an acceptable job as Clarice, though no one could hold a candle to Hopkins' frightening portrayal of Hannibal.  I admit that I have not read the book, so I cannot compare the book to the movie, though I do know of the different ending in the book. Many have said that they did not have a lot to work with from the book, but if they took artistic interpretation to the point of changing the ending, it would seem to me that they could ""interpret"" the book more to concoct a better movie.There was no plot follow-through in this movie.  It seemed as though they relied on the three or four ""blood and guts"" scenes to pull them through when they should have been more focused on presenting a cohesive film. Many times throughout the movie, my friends and I looked at one another questioningly - ""wait, who was that?"" ""What did they just say?""  ""Where did that guy come from?""  ""What COUNTRY are they in?""  They picked up an idea and just as they began to develop it, they would drop it and move on to something else.  The references to God that were made between the millionaire and Clarice were random and never developed or mentioned again. The tension that I had expected there to be between Clarice and Hannibal never seemed to develop.  Altogether it just felt like a poorly put together film.  It wasn't a horrible movie, just nothing to be excited about. Hopefully the rumors about a third (or is that fourth?) movie are just that.",Hannibal
974,ojigoku,...suffers from an identity crisis.,3,12 February 2001,"[Warning: Possible spoiler! Discusses plot.]The whole ""Hannibal the Cannibal"" series is suffering from a mid-life crisis. This third movie in the ""series"" show this clearly. After viewing it, I was left wondering what genre would be suitable for it. It is as if the movie doesn't even know what type it is.As an action movie, it is bland and slow paced. What little action exists is far from exciting. Hannibal kills one person by hanging...wow...now that is action packed. He kills another by a quick unseen knifing. The only action involves the FBI in the opening scene in which a few people get shot and 2 cars crush a guy ""The Last Boy Scout"" style. In my opinion, the final fight scene in ""The Black Six"" has more and better action then the whole of Hannibal after the opening shootout. (Look ""The Black Six"" up...just don't _ever_ watch that movie!)As a drama, not enough time is spent on character development (especially the Hannibal/Clairice bond). They only meet at the end, and when they do...not much happens. I see more love and drama in the halls at my high school that is far more entertaining than the 15 minutes or so at the end of this movie.As a horror/scary movie, it made the audience jump a measly once. It is hard to be scared when an elderly man much like your grandfather makes comical remarks as he does a poor job of killing someone. For a cannibal, Hannibal is more of a ""Mr. Rogers goes nutzo and kills a few people at the supermarket"" than the shocking killer in Silence of the Lambs. He eats only one person. One. Wow...he is one crazy cannibal! (Mr. Rogers would probably been better for the part...)As a movie that is supposed to have remotely any amount of suspense, it is just boring. I was so bored in most parts, I decided to eat the candy I had bought without taking the wrapper off. (Which was much more interesting than Hannibal.) The boredom factor hits the roof when you are subjected to watch a character in the movie use the internet. The wonderful shots of him using his mouse and double-clicking (enhanced by the theaters surround sound!) just add to the boredom/stupidity of the whole movie.Overall, I don't even know what this movie is supposed to be. It seems like a jumbled mess and anyone entering the theater not knowing anything about the whole ""Silence of the Lambs"" would be lost. I pity Blockbuster as they will eventually have to classify this utterly confused movie.",Hannibal

I think that, independently, this movie is effective in portraying Hannibal Lechter as he was originally in Silence of the Lambs. Without having seen the first part, Hannibal can still be feared and respected, as an established character. Julianne Moore, I thought, played the roll of Clarice Starling well, not in the same style as Jodie Foster, but still very good. I think that she was more athletic, much more convincing as an FBI agent. The plot was great, the camera work was excellent, and the sound was a whole story in itself.

But this movie was so incredibly disappointing.  I fully understand why Jodie Foster and Jonathon Demme refused to have anything to do with it.  I only wish that Anthony Hopkins had been so wise.  While his performance was not exactly bad, it certainly was far from the compelling acting he has done in the past in movies like ""Sense and Sensibility"" and SOTL.  But the movie overall was terrible.  Thomas Harris let the success of the first one go to his head and wrote an awful book that was turned into an even worse movie. The only reason I even went to see this one is because I had been told that the ending was changed from the book, where Starling runs off to South America with Lecter after sharing his meal of choice.  But instead of improving the ending, they only slightly altered it, so as to not destroy our impression of Starling and leave room for another poor sequel.The gore is gratuitous, the story slow and boring and the suspense totally lacking.  Whereas the original movie was one of the most terrifying movie ever made, along the lines of Hitchcock's classics, this one lacked any fear factor at all.  It only made you turn away because it was so gory and grotesque that no one wanted to look.  Ridley Scott should be ashamed, especially after the accomplishment of ""Gladiator"" which may not have been an amazing overall accomplishment, but was thoroughly entertaining nonetheless.",Hannibal

It defers from most on a very serious level. Lots will not consider this as good as ""Silence""... which it's not... it's even better. Far more smarter and contains numerous humor sequences mixed with the bloody good scares. I feel this movie (same as ""Silence"" and ""Manhunter"") is it's own film and should not really be compared to the last (or next). Without ""Silence"" or ""Manhunter"", people would be able to look at this movie in a much clearer way. What amused me most was how sick (mentally) the audience is... while watching this in the theatre I saw the audience laughing and cheering when someone would die or when blood would spurt from a wound. I feel bad that reviewers are criticizing this film for not being ""Silence""... it is something far different and far more amazing.

980,mcleanirish,Morbidly intense and overwhelming,9,16 February 2001,"Watching this film reminded me of the first 10 minutes of Armageddon.  The editing is quick, with extreme closeups and gliding shots. The editing is so fast at times, (like any Michael Bay movie) that you are thrust into the next moment before being given a complete look at the previous one.This film is not slow paced at all cinematically. In Silence, a single shot lasts for a while, giving you time to fully digest the facial expression, and the moment as a whole. Hannibal is not Silence, it is a chase movie. And the camera work, as beautiful as it is at times, enhances this fast paced story. I thought the final scenes with Julianne and Hopkins, after the ""dinner"" were as beautiful and as intense as anything i have ever scene on the screen. This moment was only enhanced by the horror of what we had just seen prior to this. A sign of a good movie, sometimes, is one that actually has a physical effect on you. Of course, any gore can accomplish this. (Note: Mason Verger's character could accomplish this on its own!) Yet, when intensity of storyline, gore, character, and music come from quality sources, you take it all the more seriously, such as with anything in life. Overall, the movie made me think, not about intelligent issues that arise (which there are few), but of the out-of-the-ordinary experience I had in seeing Hannibal. As simple as any story is, if the devices used to tell the story are strong and well thought out, a simple story becomes a masterpiece.",Hannibal

She was just a person who was there to draw out Hannibal and to show us the relationship that was and is brewing between Hannibal and Starling.When Harris writes the third book and they make a movie from that, you will see the culmination of that relationship. My favorite part was when Hannibal was trying to draw Starling out. That was an absolutely riveting scenario.Hats off to Ridley Scott and to Sir Anthony Hopkins.

There are those who have unfairly compared it to the first movie, and those who didn't like Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling.The first criticism is an unfair one. Why do you grade a sequel based on its predecessor? Why can't you simply ask yourself the question, ""Was I entertained?"" ""Was the acting superb?"" ""Was the script superb?"" ""Was this thriller thrilling?"" I feel that Hannibal stands alone as a separate movie. Even if you have never seen Silence of the Lambs, there is enough introduction of both characters to bring about an understanding of where they came from and who they are. I was truly on the edge of my seat from the moment the MGM lion roared, and that's the bottom line for me.The second criticism is absolutely laughable. It's obvious that those that make that criticism did not examine Julianne Moore's portrayal objectively. The simply observed that Jodie Foster and Julianne Moore are not the same actress, and that's enough for them to pan Julianne Moore. Actually, if you want to be objective about it, Julianne Moore is BETTER as Clarice Starling. She is more believable, more weak and strong at the same time.

Here, we get to see more of his personality as he is the central character of this film.Julianne Moore may not be as good at playing Clarice as Jodie Foster, but she holds her own in the smaller role in this story. In a reversal of fortune, Clarice seems to be in the cage most of this movie while Hannibal gets to play in historic, classic, cultural Florence.I doubt that Julianne will follow Jodie's path at the Academy Awards, but there should be a few nominations for this Dino De Laurentiis film. I would think that Hopkins may be challenged for the repeat by Oldman's -- man of 1000 faces -- performance. Nominations for direction, screenplay and supporting actors would also seem to be forth coming -- if this film is not forgotten at nomination time.It was great seeing Giancarlo Giannini (as Rinaldo Pazzi) in a pivotal role in a major American movie. The star of ""Swept Away"" and ""Seven Beauties"" from a generation ago brings depth and experience to his protagonist role in the search.My favorite parts of the novel have been brought to the screen in a visual terror befitting the director of ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"". True, there is significant blood on the screen, however the real horror is reserved for our intellectual discovery of the sociopathic mind.

Whatever the expectation, it will be met!Sir Anthony Hopkins reprises his Oscar-winning role as Dr Hannibal ""the Cannibal"" with the same calm coldness that sent chills through my spine as in ""The Silence of the Lambs"". Here, we get to see more of his personality as he is the central character of this film.Julianne Moore may not be as good at playing Clarice as Jodie Foster, but she holds her own in the smaller role in this story. In a reversal of fortune, Clarice seems to be in the cage most of this movie while Hannibal gets to play in historic, classic, cultural Florence.I doubt that Julianne will follow Jodie's path at the Academy Awards, but there should be a few nominations for this Dino De Laurentiis film. I would think that Hopkins may be challenged for the repeat by Oldman's -- man of 1000 faces -- performance. Nominations for direction, screenplay and supporting actors would also seem appropriate, unless they come up with a better film which - looking at latest releases - is a cold day in hell.
It was great seeing Giancarlo Giannini (as Rinaldo Pazzi) in a pivotal role in a major American movie. The star of ""Swept Away"" and ""Seven Beauties"" from a generation ago brings depth and experience to his protagonist role in the search.My favorite parts of the novel have been brought to the screen in a visual terror befitting the director of ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"". True, there is significant blood on the screen, however the real horror is reserved for our intellectual discovery of the sociopathic mind. Would you expect less from David Mamet?This film is more like the first Hannibal movie ""Manhunter"" then ""Silence of the Lambs"". In this series, it seems that each sequel gets better. Five Stars. I can not wait to see it again.",Hannibal
995,OmiJCS2001,A Must See,10,23 February 2001,"Not having seen Silence Of The Lambs I didn't really know what to expect. The main story is about Mason Verger Hannibals 4th victim trying to seek revenge on Hannibal. Anthony Hopkins plays a great phsyco even though I found it impossible to hate him. Julianne Moore fulfills the role of Clarice Starling very well, picking up where Jodie Foster Left off. Overall It was the best film I have seen in ages, with its make up, effects and a great storyline.",Hannibal
996,Beltaloth,Loosely based on the book.,4,21 February 2001,"This movie was a great disappointment.  I read the book and to say the very least they changed the ending.  They also left out characters and changed alot of the order of events.  They changed how things happened and sometimes if they happened at all.  I understand that you may have to leave parts out in the conversion, but there are limits and this movie definately surpassed those.  If you didn't read the book I would recommend this movie.  Rate it may 6 or 7, If you read the book skip the move (rate it 4)  The lower rating because there are sometime thing happen and they don't really explain why the character would do that.  Plus a lot of the acting wasn't great. Anthony Hopkins did do a good job in reprising his role though.  His acting saved it.",Hannibal

998,mark_branham,It Sucked!!!!,1,22 February 2001,"Ok lets start with some general comments.  Don't pay to see this at the theater, Maybe pay $1.00 at a discount theater.  Dont pay $3.50  at Blockbuster- it is still a waste of money.  Watch this on TNT or the USA network in 4 or 5 years because you are not missing anything if you wait.Hannibal does not compare to Silence of the Lambs.  The movies do not even resemble each other. Ridley Scott fell on his sword on this one and that is sad after brilliant movies like Gladiator and Clay Pigeons.Why Hannibal Sucked!!!!!!!!!!!!!1.  The character Mason Verger was an insult to my intelligence.  Someone that rich could afford plastic surgery.  It takes more that a disfigured face to make a motion picture scary or suspenseful.  This character was a joke.  It was especially stupid the way he trained the pigs to eat Hannibal, what was that all about??2.  Julianne Moore was o.k.  But her character failed to parellel Foster in SOTL's.  Moore was cold and basically a fema-Nazi while Foster was less Macho and more down to earth.  Which doesn't suprise me coming from Ridley Scott.  Hence Thelma and Louise and G.I. Jane.3.  The movie tried to create too many sub-plots without any development of the character.  Although this movie could be condensed into a 30 minute sketch on the Sci-Fi channel based on the content of the movie. It dragged on for around 2 hours.4.  There was one scary part in the film.  Out of 2 hours you get 1 minute of true suspense.  There is no theme or direction that this movie creates. It tries to be gory but ends up being senseless and gory--like something you would see on USA ""up all night""5.  One good note:  Anthony Hopkins played his part excellent.  He did the best he could with this piece of crap plot.",Hannibal
999,acidrain71,Yuck!,1,22 February 2001,"The worst movie sequel since Batman and Robin. Though I wasn't expecting a taut thriller on par with the brilliant Silence of the Lambs, this movie fails to even entertain in escapist fashion. This monstrosity is a complete waste of time and thoroughly unpleasant to watch. It's no surprise that Jonathan Demme and Jodie Foster wanted no part of this turkey, though even their replacements, Ridley Scott and Julianne Moore, have seen much better days. The story is stupid and cartoonish and even Hopkins, who was excellent in Lambs, plays Hannibal as a bad caricature of his previous performance. Moore seems to be sleeping through the movie, apparently as bored as I was. Gary Oldman is completely wasted and Ray Liotta gives a typical one dimensional performance. Boring, ugly, uninspired.

No, not as good.  This one is better.  In fact, it's one of the two most frightening movies of all times, the other being ""The Exorcist"".  HANNIBAL is really not a sequel but the third and most satisfying part of one very long and scary ride through the haunted place of abnormal psychiatry.This movie speaks to the imagination, to the feelings, to the passions, to exalted senses and to debased ones.  I admit, HANNIBAL is not for everyone. I think they should put a ""Warning!"" right after the MGM lion.  ""If you're subject to nightmares, don't see it.""  Before you head to your nearest cineplex, ask yourself these questions.  Do I want to faint with fright? Do I want to have my hair stand on end?

Was it so hard to follow? This was a completely different movie than ""Silence"". And if you could not get over the fact that Jodi Foster wasn't in it then that's your problem. Julianne Moore did a wonderful job stepping in as Starling. It sounds to me that you just didn't go into the movie with an open mind. You were looking for ""Silence..."" all over again.

Hopkins ""just is"" mezmerizing and hypnotic!..no matter what the movie and he keeps proving it over and over.Moore did a wonderful job of recreating Clarice and I was very impressed with her performance.  Also, Ray Liotta and Gary Oldham were very good. But, alas, the total, overall effect was a letdown because of the ending.

Julianne Moore does a horrible Clarice Starling.  The climax of the movie is the phone call from Dr. Lector to Starling.  This does not do justice to a great book written by Thomas Harris.  We did not see the old Dr. Hannibal Lector we all came to love in Silence of the Lambs.  Overall the making of this movie was horrible and I was sorry that I wasted my time and money on it.,Hannibal

I totally agree with the relationship between Hannibal and Clarice, and was really disappointed with the end of the movie. Although I think the movie's excellent, I do not agree with the things that happens and the totally off-book script.

I read it in 5 days and i am in the process of reading it again. The book is very very good. I didn't find the movie to be a gruesome as everyone is making it out to be, And as for the book being too disturbing to make the ending the same PUL-EASE! The movie would have ended perfectly if it had the same ending. But I love the movie as it is and I can't seem to get enough. My parents have not seen the movie and they think I am weird and many other things. I can't wait to have them watch the movie! Sir Anthony Hopkins delivered yet again another outstanding performance.

Of course Anthony Hopkins is brilliant, but Julianne Moore is great too. And Gary Oldman definitely deserves an Oscar for supporting actor, he is FANTASTIC!  My heart was pounding through the entire movie, and after it was over I was in shock for about an hour.  I can't remember being so emotionally drained after a movie.  Any film that can have that kind of effect on me has to be special.  People might remember this movie for the gore, but to me, what made the movie was the surprise we saw immediately after the brain scene.  I was completely smitten.",Hannibal

Anthony Hopkins made another best performance, a very hard character to act.  Moore also did an excellent job playing Clarice starling.  The main plot of the story is that we the audience found out where Hannibal has been for the past ten years and what brings him back to us.  Mason verger a character that makes you feel sorry for Hannibal for just a little bit.  Showing you that there are crazier people with mental problems other than Hannibal.  Towards the end is a lot of twist and turns and all the film turns out perfect! This film is right up there with 1991 filming The Silence of the Lambs.  Anthony Hopkins is the Greatest Actor of all time pulling out Hannibal every time so well! As we see Brain Cox play Hannibal in 1986 in Man-Hunter he plays him well but, Hopkins puts all he has into this one character making this film one not to be over looked!",Hannibal

That was the cheesiest brain reveal in the history of horror, which is bewildering, because that isn't the genre of Hannibal's big screen debut. Silence of the Lambs was a psychological thriller. One might argue that David Mamet had the creative freedom to redirect Harris's book towards other genres. One might be encouraged to tend to one's oral fixation with a phallic organ, while plunging that argument up their own backside, because using the same actors to play the same main characters means ONE DOES NOT GET TO BE A GENRE TRAITOR.Why would Clarice have her hair down while carrying a gun? Why would she spin her head exactly 90° to her left when she hears a gunshot, as if she was longing to wear her character shoes or jazz shoes and audition for Chicago? SHE WOULDN'T. Why does Hannibal store the brain in common Tupperware? Why does he have Clarice wear a dress with a plunging neckline? HE WOULDN'T. For the love of God, Mamet.And what were you two thinking, ANTHONY & GARY?!? BAD! Bad legendary actors! Julianne Moore is not my Clarice Starling, and she was not yours, either, even though you tried. YOU KNOW BETTER. No soup for you.Et tu, Juliette? You were wonderful in Magnolia. You should have stayed there. Did you need more? You might have believed that you would present a different sort of Clarice Starling. You were a fool to entertain the notion. There is no other Clarice.THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE. Jodi Foster. It is said.I spent most of the movie yelling at the television, as you can imagine.

Rather, I would like to discuss the movie in its DVD format.  For those of you who have already made the purchase, you may notice several scenes in which frames have been removed, particularly the ""dinner"" scene towards the end.  And no, these frames are not recovered in the special features.  I find it disconcerting, yet hauntingly familiar that Scott, or whoever was in charge of the editing process, would alter the movie from its theatrical release just to save...time? Money perhaps?  This isn't the first movie to undergo a bit of scraping around the edges as it is transferred from the big screen to the little one.  I am disappointed to see that Scott would allow this.  Ah well...the extra/alternate scenes do provide the viewer with a more complete picture of Lecter's ties to Starling, though Scott does stray a bit in his storyboard-to-shot comparisons.

They'll be watching this a hundred years from now because they'll be watching Silence of the Lambs 100 years from now and then they'll want to watch this one.

I for one, liked this better than ""the silence of the lambs"" ..it has a warmer feeling, a cultural side, filled with some kind of pleasurable ""aroma""... Anthony Hopkins puts out a remarkable performance and I like Julianne Moore so much more than Jodie Foster. The movie presents the Lecter character in all his splendor and as it shows the strange feelings that this brilliant mad man has for Clarice (the female officer that intrigued him from the very beginning), J.Moore fits perfectly in the role. More beautiful, more feminine than Jodie. Also, the main character, Hopkins, the guy I want to see, in this movie, is in the center of the action, he is the hunted one, he IS the action. In Silence of the Lambs he appears for 15 minutes ( he won an Oscar anyway:) ). Overall, I felt Hannibal a lot closer to what I like than the first Lecter movie.",Hannibal

The movie and the book are quite different, so I don't think one spoils the enjoyment of the other. The book does what the movie just can not--gently and completely explores the inner workings of Hannibal's mind. It is an amazing feat, one that Harris should certainly get more credit for producing.Also, The endings of the book versus the movie do present very different pictures of Clarice as a person--either of which I think is a valid interpretation of her character.

You never even see Hannibal eat anybody, well that is not completely true. I highly doubt it if anyone cannot stand the blood, if you read the book the movie is a breeze. Anthony Hopkins is the only man who can play the part of the intellectual cannibal. Hopkins does it magnificently as in Silence of the Lambs, Bravo I salute him. Julian Moore was not too bad herself. Although I was looking forward to Jody Foster playing the part of Starling again, Moore played the part wonderfully.

The script is filled with plot holes and cliches, the direction is directionless, the special effects (especially near the end of the movie) are laughably bad, the performances are flat, the movie is overly predictable, and most importantly it is a thriller without thrills.  But it has gore.  But I say gruesome is not enough for a sequel to The Silence of the Lambs, a wonderful, intense, scary movie.  I hesitate to call it a sequel, because the characters return in name only.  It is appropriate that a different actress play Clarice Starling, because she is not the same strong character from the first film.  Julianne Moore's lacks even the physicality to pull off the role.  In a movie filled with flaws, the one unforgivable flaw is that it just isn't scary.  My wife was the real test.  She hates horror and suspense movies.  She could barely sit through Silence of the Lambs.  She had no trouble sitting through Hannibal, except boredom.  This is  the worst sequel to a classic film since The Sting II.",Hannibal

It lived up to that title, HANNIBAL.  In the movie you learn nothing new about the doctor except that he is living in Italy, thats about it.  It's not a bad film, but it's not a great one either ( Like the silence of the lambs was). Here Hopkins is the star of the film, unlike lambs where he was the 2nd star) and yet we do not get to see him until 30 minutes into the movie. For me, he is the main reason why I went to see it, because of him, not to see Moore for the first 30 min.  Then when we do see him it's only for 30 maybe 45 seconds, then it's right back to Moore for another section of the movie.  From on screen time I would bet that Moore was on the screen alot more that Hopkins. And he is the star of the film, or that was what I thought by the title, it's named after him for one thing.Last but not least, the ending, I WILL NOT SAY WHAT HAPPENS, but that is how they wanted to end it. I liked the books ending and after the movie's one I like it a lot now.  They have two fair writers, a great director, a great cast, a year and a half to make it, and an 87 million dollar budget,( 4x what lambs had to make do with, and it's ending was perfect), and that was the best they could come up with all the time they had.  No wonder they got Ted Tally to write Red Dragon for them, if you let those two writers write Red Dragon, who knows, they might have Ralph Fiennes, Dolarhyde fly away by growing a set of wings.

But it's witty, romantic and perhaps ""gothic"" also.There are philosophical and mythological subtexts. There is something archetypal in this film. Ridley Scott uses totally different approach than Jonathan Demme and it is a good choice, it is very European movie.If you like Friedrich Nietzsche, Arthur Schopenhauer and Ladislav Klima and if you are open-minded (no pun intended) you will enjoy this arty dark thriller about the circles of hell in human thoughts (and deeds).What should I say more? Try it without prejudices. Maybe it's strange and over-the-top, but it works. I love it.",Hannibal
1036,jorgedo,Disappointed. Very bad adaptation of the Thomas Harris' Book,3,23 April 2003,"I am disappointed. Read the Thomas Harris' book ""Hannibal"" and find the real, wonderful story. The film distorts the story, focusing on the scary details and left out other interesting plot elements, as the Mason Verger sister.  Plus the ending is so commercial, it's like ""Hannibal 2"" is coming soon... The book ends clearly the story, with no open subjects.",Hannibal
1037,shibainulady1922,Revolted by the Ending,5,28 November 2011,"I purposefully read Thomas Harris' novels, The Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal in sequence in order to gain a better understanding the films. In SOTL I found the film and book to be in great sync with one another, despite what other reviewer's might have said. Hannibal was good, but I say this as I have not yet read Red Dragon. But, I was disappointed at the ending. While I don't agree with everything from the novel, I don't appreciate the dialogue between Hannibal and Starling in the film. It is as if Starling loses her interest in Hannibal simply because she is seeing him do what he does best: KILL. She seems put off by the characteristics in which she is drawn to in Hannibal in the first place. I have always loved the relationship between the two of them, and in Hannibal the film, you miss that. The part of the novel where Hannibal gets Starling to open up about her father, and where Hannibal thinks of Mischa, are important and help us to further understand the actions behind the characters decisions. The film lacks that. I also thought Julianne Moore was a poor Starling. Jodie Foster was perfect. She had the look in her eyes that made you, as a viewer, believe she was almost dazzled by Lecter, as Lecter was dazzled by her. I do not see that with Moore. I also did not like how Jack Crawford's character was depicted, or what little depiction he DID have, in either version (film or novel). In summation- the book was good, the movie was slightly better than terrible. I think SOTL set up a very original and unique viewpoint of the serial killer obsession and draw in our society, and Hannibal let that uniqueness vanish- as well as it did so in the novel.",Hannibal
1038,blueorchids,a credit to Mr. Scott *possible SPOILERS to follow*,10,17 March 2004,"Hannibal, though a horror movie, is one of my personal favorites. Certainly not for the content (cannibalism) but for the way it was so beautifully presented.  Everything about this movie was a 10, from the story, the excellent score, even the lighting (which gets overlooked as a secondary character in most movies).  It was true to what I felt were the the character's feelings, something I did not find in the book written by Thomas Harris.  I liked the book, but I loved the movie.The story is set some years after Silence of the Lambs and finding both Starling and Lecter at turning points in their lives, on a collision course to each other.  In this movie, despite his horrific acts, I couldn't despise Lecter as I did in Silence.  It brought back some old saying that not all monsters are hideous and obvious to the naked eye to my mind.  The ending, which was different from the book's, was the best ending I could have hoped for.  It was a point in the movie about Starling's convictions and her loyalty to doing the right thing.  I'm glad that the writers didn't sacrifice them to be true to the book.  All the actors, the despicable and the loved characters, did a fabulous job.  Julianne Moore was a better Starling than Jodie Foster in my personal opinion.  Gary Oldman deserves special note for his performance as Mason Verger.  I've seen Oldman in a lot of roles, but his role in Hannibal is by far the best.GO see this movie!  It's right up there with Gladiator and Black Hawk Down, two of Ridley Scott's other films.",Hannibal
1039,Whooly,An atmospheric masterpiece - highly underrated,9,7 June 2005,"I've rarely seen a motion picture with such a dense atmosphere - let alone such a magnificent score. Lightyears away from it's predecessor SotL. Graphic - yes - but at the same time so subtly spine-thrilling. Lector's fascinating, ambiguous character is perfectly acted out by Hopkins - something not accomplished in SotL (though it being a good movie). There we see almost only the repugnant side of Hannibal caged in his supermax cell - with much of the plot centering around other (too obvious)things. Here we get an excellent character study of Lector. Lector is fascinating...the viewer almost succumbs to this gentleness and sophistication.Though there are flaws in the acting - especially Ray Liotta (Superb in Good Fellas) is a let-down, whereas Moore is excellent (glad, Foster turned down the role) - the brilliantly shot, beautiful pictures and the score are creating such a stunning atmosphere that I consider those and other flaws negligible.Easily the best part of the trilogy.",Hannibal
1040,Redrum237,Dinner is served,6,12 August 2003,"Contains spoilers While not as good as the first, Hannibal was definitely a very interesting movie. It was very well shot and contained many interesting subplots. The film doesnt suffer much from the lack of Jodie Foster as Julianne Moore does a good job as portraying Clarice Starling 10 years later. While the film has its share of creepy and definitely memorable moments, it unfortunately may be remembered more for its outrageous and sometimes disgusting gore than anything. Guttings, a person tearing their own face off, throat slashings, ravenous pigs, and even a person's brain being eaten are some of the highlights of this movie. I think this film has been unfairly panned by many people. Its major downfall is how people compare it to Silence of the Lambs rather than on its own as an individual movie. I'd give this movie 7.5 out of 10, worth seeing for fans of the original, anyone who likes horror movies, or anyone else who is curious or wants to see this movie. However this is NOT for people who cant tolerate gore or nasty stuff",Hannibal
1041,nstern,how clever was Jodie Foster,1,16 October 2003,"After the rightfully celebrated `Silence of the Lambs"", a sequel was unavoidable. A most unfortunate matter. Director Ridley Scott took a huge box office and cinematic achievement, a fantastic idea and a promising cast, and than threw them all together, creating a long, boring, insignificant and pathetic film. After the first ten minutes the immanent question `Has Mr. Scott ever watched Silence of the Lambs?' pops to one's head, where it will stay for another 2 full hours.  In `Hannibal', the dreadful Dr. Lecter has no character, no motivation (besides an over developed appetite) and a specially, no psychological persona or identity. This fact is so clear, that even a gifted actor such as Anthony Hopkins is (in lack of a better phrase)- ineffective.`Hannibal' is, therefore, a film about an unstable man who enjoys fried human brain with a glass of Chianti, and not a film about the essence of evil, about fears that were never faced and about the mysterious paths of human abnormality. In order to make the viewers to over look this lack of substance, Scott gives us the standard special effects, thus lowering his film to the same level as Jon Woo's `Face/off'. In the latter, the result was bearable, as Woo never pretended to do nothing but another summer time thriller. Also, his effects are much better.BAD BAD taste. At least we got `Red Dragon' to save the dignity of this trilogy.",Hannibal
1042,barderella-145-272963,Ok I guess,5,13 August 2018,"Julianne Moore is not Jodi Foster. Hopkins is always brilliant, but even he cannot save this mediocre at best film. The plot was pretty lame and Liotta was quite awful.",Hannibal
1043,michaelpmurphy,A great movie in its own right,10,12 December 2006,"The most enjoyable aspect of this movie is that, contrary to what the working title might suggest, it does not try to be Silence of the Lambs 2, and anyone who went into the theater with that expectation was probably either pleasantly surprised (as I was) or sorely disappointed.Lecter and Starling are the only characters (aside from Barney) who have returned from the previous movie, but they have changed quite a bit in the meantime. Starling has become a much tougher, hardened agent than in her previous appearance as an FBI trainee, while Lecter has managed to blend seamlessly into Florentian culture, and even to gain respect among scholars as a Renaissance historian. Moreover, the script does not feel forced (thanks to Thomas Harris' brilliant writing), but rather flows naturally as a continuation of Lecter's actions from before his incarceration.In addition, the storyline shows significant contrast at times to its predecessor. One of the overarching themes in ""Silence of the Lambs"" was that appearance often hides true nature. This is exemplified by Lecter's dissection of Starling's psyche (the 'accent she tried so hard to shed'), by Catherine Martin, the anonymous victim who turned out to be the daughter of a US Senator, and especially by the nature of Buffalo Bill and the motives for his crimes.However, ""Hannibal"" develops the exact opposite idea, that one should not necessarily assume appearances to be deceiving. There are a plethora of vivid examples: Mason Verger, who despite his ghastly appearance seems quite jovial for most of the movie before revealing his monstrous side; Pazzi, the descendant of an infamous Florentine traitor, who himself engages in treachery to his own demise; Paul, the arrogant asshole who turns out to be just as backstabbing as you expected him to be. This theme culminates at the end of the movie with Hannibal once again mocking Clarice's devotion to the FBI, and her vain attempt to prove her own incorruptibility by serving those who are themselves corrupt. ""All you would need for that, Clarice, is a mirror."" While popular opinion often dictates that the sequel to a great movie detracts from the mystique of the original, ""Hannibal"" is in my opinion an ideal model for how to make such a sequel. There is continuity without redundancy, and while ""Silence of the Lambs"" is a clear-cut thriller, its framework is used to construct an elaborate and comprehensive moral tale which becomes a great movie in its own right.10/10",Hannibal
1044,1493,Pathetic. A Disgrace. ***SPOILERS***,4,15 March 2005,"When I first saw ""The Silence of the Lambs"", I was awestruck. I thought, ""Hey! I need now need to see ""Hannibal."" I. Was. Wrong.Unfortunately, Jodie Foster didn't reclaim her Oscar(registered trademark)- winning role as Agent Clarice Starling. That role went to Julianne Moore. Moore's acting is not what one would expect from such a great actress. Her acting is mediocre at best. She tries at Jodie Foster's West Virginian accent too hard, and turns out sounding more like a man than she does a woman.Anthony Hopkins, one of the few things I liked about this movie, returns as Dr. Hannibal Lecter, the cannibalistic psychologist . His acting is much better than Moore's, but nothing compared to his Oscar(registered trademark)-winning role as Dr. Lecter in ""The Silence of the Lambs."" Hopkins delivers a better performance than most actors do in mediocre films. Ray Liotta plays the part of Paul Krenzler. I don't understand why he's in this film. Sure, he puts pressure on Starling about Lecters whereabouts, but that's about all he does besides *SPOILER* eating his own brains. The plot... pointless. It really never develops, except for the final meeting between Clarice and Dr. Lecter. That is the only thing in this movie that develops. Anything else, never goes anywhere. Clarice's meeting's with Lecter's victim end abruptly, and you suddenly see him *SPOILER* right before he dies.Director Ridley Scott. Great director. Bad movie. The ""Aliens"" and ""Gladiator"" director didn't execute high quality work, as he should have. Other than that, that's the only negative thing about Scott's directing.*SPOILER* As entertaining as the ""Brains for Dinner"" scene was, it was highly stupid. Also unrealistic. Another unrealistic part of this movies was *SPOILER* the man-eating pigs. I raised pigs. They're stupid. They can't learn anything besides how to eat, sleep, and wallow in the mud.""Red Dragon"", ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Hannibal"" prequel, is much better than the ""Hannibal"" *censored* I saw.

1046,pnattress,I doubt it'd silence Starling's lambs,6,6 June 2004,"If you watch this film expecting Silence of the Lambs 2, you will doubtless be disappointed. The plot ping-pongs between a disgraced Starling (played by Julliane Moore, almost re-inventing the role for herself) rummaging through the FBI archives in Washington, and an Italian police officer who stumbles across Lecter in Florence - Anthony Hopkins can still deliver the goods, but his performance is not nearly as impressive as it was in ""Lambs"". Also, like an annoying and somewhat irrelevant buzzing noise in the background, is a disfigured victim of Lecter's played by an almost unrecognizable Gary Oldman.The plot is fair, but occasionally sloppy and certainly lacks the tension that made the original so enthralling. We see much more of Lecter, but the character is simply regurgitated from ""Lambs"" rather than expanded - there's even dialogue from the original played back on a dictaphone. The excessive violence in the film does nothing except shock and adds nothing... the famous ""brain"" scene which you'll have no doubt heard about was used as a major means of selling the film to a young audience (certainly I recall my classmates being very excited by it) and does nothing for the film as a whole, and the same goes for the rest of the explicitly violent content that the first film managed without.Still, it's a fair story, the acting is good, and the chance of seeing Hopkins as Lecter again is no doubt enough on its own to entice some. But it will never better ""the Silence of the Lambs"".",Hannibal

It could not have the same impact as Silence of the Lambs - we know the main characters now and have some idea what to expect, and that, along with a couple of gruesome scenes (gratuitously so, many people have said) are what have made ""expert"" reviewers disregard this as a mediocre follow up.Anthony Hopkins performance is fantastic as you would expect, and Julianne Moore does a very good job too, and the Italian guy who plays Inspector Pazzi is very good** Possible vague spoiler ** My one criticism would be the ending which leaves you unsure exactly what has happened and wondering what happens next. The whole film sticks more or less to the story of the book, apart from the fact that Mason's sister is written out of the film.

Then ten years later, Hannibal came out by a different director, as always I was curious. Was this going to be bad or good, or neither. It was very good, in my personal opinion I liked it better than Silence. But was disappointed by the ending were Hannibal got away again. No death scene? But, anyway, I loved this movie.

1051,Shroudedmonkey,Good except for the butchered ending,9,2 December 2005,"The only thing I didn't like about the movie Hannibal was the ending. It was like they just gave up trying to make the ending match the one Thomas Harris wrote for the book. It would have been much better if they had just spent a little extra time & money to do it right the first time instead of having to worry about it now that Behind the Mask is going to be released. All in all, it was a fairly amusing movie and somewhat accurate to the novel and still one of my favorites. The little boy eating Krendler's brain at the end of the film was a nice touch and Pazzi's death was fairly accurate, but I can never watch the ending without feeling somewhat disgusted by the characters' actions.",Hannibal
1052,bellademetria-10845,I really felt like it sucked. More than Krendler on his own brain.,1,7 January 2017,"I feel like this really didn't live up to my expectations. I knew in advance that this was particularly violent compared to Silence of the Lambs, but I didn't expect constant, unneeded gore; and I also expected it to be at least as good as Silence of the Lambs (despite the violence and knowing that it never really would be the same).I also felt that the ending was rather rushed and not true to the book at all. In the book, it seemed like he genuinely wanted to look after her and help her - whereas in this movie, the rushed 20 minutes at the end where she is finally in repeated contact with him, they just go full psycho and it seems like he's deliberately making her uncomfortable, which wasn't the point. I feel like I am most likely overly critical of this, but it just seemed wrong to watch it.Not to mention the brief moments of contact - on the carousel, when he brushed the back of her hair, and when she was asleep - would have been nice if they were done well, but they weren't. Instead of making me feel fuzzy (because I do ship them) they made me cringe all the way to the end and really wish I hadn't watched it.",Hannibal
1053,venelinalqmova,I expected more...,6,2 January 2018,"I must say that after watching ""The Silence of the Lambs"" I expected more form this one. 
I was so captivated by Hannibal Lecter and his mind and way of analysing others. And besides, Anthony Hopkins is more than perfect for this role.
But however, about the movie - I can definitely say that it was interesting for me. This hole chasing between FBI agent Starling and Dr. Lecter was so good... BUT some moments were too much for me and this is the only reason for my rating. The scene with the brain was too much... and not only this one. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" was the perfect psychological thriller, without being disgusting.",Hannibal
1054,desyscarso,Do sadists exist with the heart?,7,3 April 2018,"In this film I nurtured a love-hate of Lecter. I hate him for sadism (which shows when he eats the brain of a living person) but at the same time I love it because I think that behind all that malice there is a good part, which shows us when he saves the Starling and when he cuts his hand instead of that of the woman. overall nice film, but the previous one was more beautiful.",Hannibal
1055,HannibalHopkins,"Great Acting, Unfortunate Script",7,11 January 2006,"While this was a magnificent book, and a brilliant series, I wish they would have made the movie ending the same as the book. But then, if they had, people would not have seen the same effect as the did in the book due to a time rush. Hannibal and Clarice have a beautiful, yet complicated relationship, which many would have viewed as sloppy if rushed and squeazed into a 2 hour 11 minute movie. As it is, I spend my happy little free time explaining the slightly difficult to understand ending of the novel, which had unlimited space to thoroughly explain their love. You see, Thomas Harris loves metaphors and mystery, and his novels do as well. They were made for those who would, ""see beyond his plight,"" in terms of the Good Doctor. So, sadly, the movie leaves shallow, less thoughtful, and/or closed minded people seeing a ravenous cannibal killer with a crush, and a decadent, bad girl FBI agent in a twisted love plot, and the Lecterphilles who fell in love with the complex couple completely in a state of disdain. We loved the book because it wasn't afraid to say what was meant to be, it had INTEGRITY. Where is the movies? I guess it's a good thing Sir Anthony Hopkins is a seemingly wonderful kisser.KW",Hannibal
1056,sdark6,"Hannibal vs Red Dragon, no contest.",10,12 March 2006,"As a lover of the Thomas Harris books and of silence of the lambs i expected Hannibal to be mediocre by comparison, albeit ridley scott in the directorial role. But as much as SOTL did for plot and intensity, Hannibal did in much greater measure explore the world of Dr. Lecter.To see what would be widely regarded as a revolting and grotesque human being capable of unmeasurable acts of cruelty and violence, out in the free world where he displays decorum and humility is about as frightening an experience as i could imagine. And moreover Ridley Scott captures this magnificently. Many Hollywood directors have tried and failed to capture the feel and dramatic cultural differences between ancient and contemporary cities and the way this film is shot is purely breathtaking.But back to point and its short. Brett Ratner and Red Dragon sees Dr. Lecter back in prison, and as he was in SOTL a background character, although rather significant, but the whole feel of the film once again loses the dichotomy of lecters abhorrent nature and attempts to capture the more important characters and plot lines like SOLT, the tooth fairy, Clarice and originally buffalo bill. Interesting characters yes, but Hannibal is the only work to really show the depth of Dr. Lecters nature and the film was accurately entitled so.Love the story and suspense of Silence of the Lambs, Red Dragon was in my opinion another SOTL but with different storyline and Hannibal was by far the most intriguing and terrifying look at how any person cannot be judged by their appearance or mannerism. Beautiful and scary work.",Hannibal
1057,kzmumtaz,Not impressed,3,10 June 2007,"There were good things about this movie. But they weren't enough to make this film enjoyable. First of all, Jullianne Moore is absolutely annoying. I know Jodie Foster turned down the role, but why did they have to pick Moore? I loathed every scene with her in it. The film also made no sense to me. Hannibal was a monster. Why save him? Let the SOB die. Clarice risked her life and killed 3 people to rescue him from the boars (although verger did deserve it). This would never have happened in real life. Anybody in their right minds would have let Lecter die. Utter stupidity. I haven't seen Hannibal Rising but I have to say this is the worst movie of the series.",Hannibal
1058,anogomous,What on earth?!?,5,13 July 2006,"If you have never read the book, rent the movie. The movie by itself is well done, genuinely horrible in the best sense of horror-movie horrible. **SPOILER** But (and here's where I had the big problem) the end of the movie was so different from the end of the book that I didn't 'get it'. Harris leads us through Hannibal's memory palace to a specific place... beyond the trite ending of the movie and into the character's psyche. The fact that the screenwriter completely ignored Mischa and Hannibal's plight as children really hurt the movie. There's nothing more fulfilling than being able to understand why, and the screenwriters left us to wonder. I was also disappointed that they ignored the romantic aspects of Clarice and Hannibal's relationship. She was completely compromised: the lover of a monster, no longer with the FBI...completely changed. The absence of these two elements left the ending flat. But as I have said, it is a good movie if you are not biased by the novel. Hopkins is ever brilliant and Julianne Moore does a great job with what she was given. All in all, worth the trip to the video store.",Hannibal
1059,lenajulia184,A great movie with a bad reputation,10,28 November 2006,"I think this movie is totally underestimated. After seeing 'the Silence of the Lambs' I didn't expect much from 'Hannibal'. I thought the Silence was rather boring. But I did watch this and was impressed. Yes, there is gory scenes in the movie, like the brain-eating thing, but I didn't really find it as disgusting as everyone says. As a movie I think this was much more beautiful than it's two prequels, but the only positive comment I've ever heard about 'Hannibal' was from my father. What I wonder is why Jodie Foster didn't act in this movie. Not to offense Julianne Moore, I think she was actually much better in the role of Clarice Starling than Foster was, but it's always confusing when the actor changes. The best thing in this movie was, of course, Anthony Hopkins's Hannibal Lecter. I doubt that there's anyone who could do the role better. The other actors were good too, like Gary Oldman as Mason Verger. As a movie, 'Hannibal' was one of the best horror movies ever and I can't see why it's gotten so much critic.",Hannibal
