0,bkoganbing,A Longing For The Other One's Life,5,6 August 2011,"Ryan Reynolds and Jason Bateman play a pair of friends who get their minds rerouted into each other's bodies and now have to deal with how the other half lives. As is the case in these kinds of films it's not so easy living another's life no matter how well you think you know the other person.Especially with these two. Bateman works for a white shoe Atlanta law firm and these guys look more at home on Wall Street than Peachtree Street. In fact that's one of the more interesting things in The Change-Up. I swear but I did not hear one accent that sounded like it came from Georgia. Bateman is explained somewhat that he was educated in the Ivy League and clerked for Justice David Souter. Then again so was Ben Matlock similarly educated. Bateman is married with wife Leslie Mann and he's all about career.Reynolds is an ace screw up, he's on the latest of many careers, he's now doing soft core porn although he says he's an actor. These two guys truly should have drifted apart.But after a night of merriment and carousing the two feel the need to bleed the old lizard and both express a longing for the other one's life. And then the Grecian goddess statue of the fountain they're relieving themselves grants the wish.If you saw Walt Disney Studios Freaky Friday you know exactly what's going to happen here. The only difference here is that we have some more adult situations than Disney Studios would have in their pictures.Reynolds and Bateman work hard, but this is all very tired material.",The Change-Up
1,SnoopyStyle,It's all been done before,5,9 September 2013,"Friends for life Mitch (Ryan Reynolds) and Dave (Jason Bateman) are starting to drift apart as their lifestyle divert. Dave is overworked, rich but wants more freedom. Mitch is single, freewheeling but wants Dave's success. One drunken night, they crossed streams while peeing and switched bodies. They get their wishes, but is it really what they want? Leslie Mann is really funny in one scene as Dave's wife. But the movie is just mostly tiresome and unlikeable. The over the line gross out humor is just trying too hard. It's a body switch movie and it feels tired.",The Change-Up
2,Prismark10,Living the fast life,4,29 March 2016,Dave (Jason Bateman) is a corporate lawyer working his way up to partnership and a devoted family man. Mitch (Ryan Reynolds) is a womanising stoner who appears in soft core movies and is distant from his father who is re-marrying.Both envy each other's lifestyles and after peeing in a fountain they body swap.Now Mitch inside Dave's body finds that being a corporate lawyer working on a big merger is no fun while also doing chores for the kids and keeping a wife happy after she has had a Thai meal which gives her the runs.Dave now living Mitch's life finds out that making soft core films is no fun nor is trying to have sex with an extremely pregnant woman.The film has a lot of gross out humour and nudity. A baby crapping on Bateman's face for example. It mixes the body swap premise popular in the 1980s with the crude humour from The Hangover type of films.However despite Reynolds and Bateman having a nice chemistry the film is formulaic despite the rudeness and not really funny.,The Change-Up
3,claudio_carvalho,"Overworked, but Always Funny Storyline",7,26 January 2012,"In Atlanta, Dave Lockwood (Jason Bateman) is an efficient and dedicated lawyer that expects to be promoted to partner of the law firm where he has been working for ten years after a merging operation and a family man, married with the gorgeous Jamie Lockwood (Leslie Mann) and father of three children. His best friend is the aspirant actor Mitch Planko (Ryan Reynolds), who is single, reckless and unemployed, and a quitter that never concludes what he is doing.One night, Dave and Mitch drink a lot and they go to a fountain to pee and they both simultaneously wish to have the life of the other. On the next morning, they wake up and discover that they had switched bodies. They return to the square and find that the fountain has moved to an unknown place. Therefore, Mitch needs to become responsible to save the job and the promotion of his friend, while Dave feels how complicated is for him to date with his sexy and gorgeous colleague Sabrina McArdle (Olivia Wilde). Sooner they learn more about themselves and also that the life of the other is not as good and they believe it could be.""The Change-Up"" is an entertaining film with an overworked, but always funny storyline. I do not recall how many comedies I have seen with two persons switching bodies, but I always laugh a lot. ""The Change-up"" is no exception, especially with the hilarious Ryan Reynolds, Jason Bateman and Leslie Mann and the gorgeous Olivia Wilde, one of the most beautiful actresses that I have recently seen.There are particularly two (gross) scenes that I repeated many times since I could not stop laughing: when Dave is cleaning his baby and trying to reach the diaper and when Mitch is in Dave's body and sees the half-naked Jamie going to the bathroom. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Eu Queria Ter a Sua Vida"" (""I Wish I Had Your Life"")",The Change-Up
4,nogodnomasters,AD NAUSEAM,6,4 December 2018,"If you haven't grown tired of watching movies where people trade places, i.e. their brain in someone else's body, then you haven't been watching enough movies. Tom Hanks gave us perhaps the best of these movies. In this version it is ""married man"" swapping with ""college buddy"" although they have known each other since the third grade. I watched the unrated version. They wish for each others life while urinating in a park fountain...which is gone the next day and no one knows where it is at!!!! At least until Vic ( city official) gets back off vacation. Ryan Reynolds plays Mitch who is an actor...but now has trouble playing a lawyer. Dave (Jason Bateman) is a lawyer married to Leslie Mann. They have twins. He suddenly becomes a single man. Their goal is to try to get by day by day until they can locate the magical wishing fountain. Of course this doesn't last for one minute as the lawyer has turned into an f-bomb throwing idiot, and we find out Mitch stars in soft-core films or lorno (light porno) as they are called in the movie.When the movie is not being crude and sophomoric, it works fairly well. The guys get to see how others view them, for better or worse. Mitch discovers he is way too juvenile and needs to grow up. Dave discovers life is more than status. The extras include a deleted scene and a gag reel not worth the view. Not as good as either ""Hang Over"" film, more akin to ""Hall Pass.""Excessive F-bomb, sex, toilet humor, nudity (Leslie Mann, Mircea Monroe, Taaffe O'Connell, Olivia Wilde? brief body double?)",The Change-Up
5,kosmasp,It's freaky f'in Friday,5,13 March 2012,"Yes this is ""R-rated"" (the weirdest bit being Leslie Mann showing skin for this) and maybe that is a reason to love (or admire the risk the producers took with it) the movie more than it actually is worth. The actors would deserve better. Ryan Reynolds and Bateman really give their all and are genuinely funny.Also very gross of course, but the charm of the leading duo makes up for that. It does really go all the way and tries not to pull any punches. If you look for something nice and cuddly, this probably will offend you. It won't satisfy the ones who were waiting for something raunchy either (I suspect), but at least it tries. It's endearing at attempting and trying, but is that enough for you?",The Change-Up
6,jboothmillard,The Change-Up,8,10 June 2014,"I knew about the two leading actors of this film, and I knew it was something about swapping either bodies or lifestyles, of course when I knew for definite what the concept was I was looking forward to it, from director David Dobkin (Shanghai Knights, Wedding Crashers, Fred Claus). Basically in Atlanta, Georgia, Dave Lockwood (Jason Bateman) is a professional hardworking lawyer with wife Jamie Lockwood (Leslie Mann) and kids, and Mitch Planko (Ryan Reynolds) is an irresponsible slacker actor who has sex with various women, they are close friends and have become jealous of each other's lifestyles, so after both getting drunk this urinate in a park fountain together, and simultaneously wish they had each other's lives. The next morning Dave and Mitch have switched bodies, they meet up and realise it is because of the wish they made while urinating in the fountain, but returning to it's place it has been removed for restorations, so they are forced to wait until is located by the parks department, and they agree to pretend to be each other for the day. Mitch, as Dave, at the firm befriends Dave's attractive assistant Sabrina McArdle (Rush's Olivia Wilde), but lacking professionalism and with no legal knowledge he causes a big merger to fall through, and Dave, as Mitch, arrives on a movie shoot, but he was not told it would be a porno, the two try to convince Jamie of the situation, but she does not believe either of them, to help him Dave gives Mitch lessons of how to be professional, and Mitch sets Dave up on a date with Sabrina who he has had a crush on. Mitch at first admits to himself he is not cut out to dedicate himself to the demands of business, the responsibilities of looking after children, and maintaining a marriage, but he is determined to prove himself and others he can do it, while Dave takes advantage of the free lifestyle, doing everything he can to relax, and he also agrees to a date with Sabrina, but they actually start to like each other, and even get tattoos together. Dave does get a call from the District Manager's about the location of the fountain, but Dave and Mitch meeting each other imply that they both want to stay in each other's bodies, and in doing so Mitch secures a lucrative business deal for the firm after making partners, a gala is held to celebrate, Jamie also attending has been feeling unappreciated after a forgotten anniversary, and Dave is close to having sex with Sabrina. At the gala a presentation showing the accomplishments Dave has achieves over the years is playing, but Mitch knows it is not him, and Dave remembers his family when Sabrina is getting undressed, getting together they realise they want their own lives back, Dave kissing Jamie does make her realise he is in Mitch's body, and they rush to the Peachtree Galleria where the fountain is located, but they are surrounded by hoards of people. Eventually they both relax and urinate and after the three tries manage to wish themselves back into their original bodies and lifestyles, the next morning Dave wakes happy to be with Jamie and his children, and Mitch admires himself and takes Sabrina to breakfast, Mitch speaks at the wedding of his father (Alan Arkin), and Dave and Jamie celebrate their anniversary, with his friend invited. Also starring Mircea Monroe as Tatiana, Gregory Itzin as Flemming Steel, Ned Schmidtke as Ted Norton, Ming Lo as Ken Kinkabe, Sydney Rouviere as Cara Lockwood and Scary Movie 4's Craig Bierko as Valtan. Obviously at first Bateman and Reynolds play the characters you would expect, but once they swap bodies they absolutely play against type and the best laughs come from them trying to adapt and get lost in the chaos, Mann is great being dry as well. This is exactly the same kind of body swap movie as something like Freaky Friday, but much more funny and for the older generation, full of unrelentless gross out moments, sexual stuff and bad language, there are the small sentimental moments, but that does not spoil it from being a great shake-up to the genre, a hilarious comedy. Very good!",The Change-Up
7,paul_haakonsen,A rather good movie...,6,7 November 2011,"""The Change-Up"" was actually quite nice. Sure the essential story plot have been used many, many times before in other movies, but hey, it worked well enough. And this movie was actually one of the better of the changing-body-type of movie.There is a good deal of comedy throughout the movie, and I was laughing out loud a couple of times at some of the scenes. Especially the poop scene in the beginning of the movie, that was hilarious. Actually one of my favorite scenes in the entire movie.What made ""The Change-Up"" stand out from other similar movies? Well this movie had comedy, as I mentioned, but it also has some really good, solid underlying story lines. The movie is heavy on the matter of friendship, trust, love and acceptance. And it tells this and deals with it in a good way, and doesn't come off as preachy or with a raised finger.It was really good to see Ryan Reynolds (playing Mitch Planko) in a role that didn't include spandex and super powers for once. And of course it is always a joy to watch Jason Bateman (playing Dave Lockwood) in a movie. Leslie Mann (playing Jamie Lockwood) also did her part to carry the movie and make it interesting.One thing did puzzle me though. How would the scenes in the kitchen with the baby brandishing a knife about and the other kid licking the electrical outlet and almost putting a hand into a blender actually make it to (and be accepted) the screen in an American movie? Personally, I don't mind seeing such, as it was all movies and not real, but I guess those scenes would be inappropriate to some people.I found ""The Change-Up"" to be a good family with a heartfelt story and it was really well presented and acted out on the screen. Definitely worth a watch if you enjoy a good comedy, or if you want a good, semi-romantic evening with your cherished one.",The Change-Up
8,edwagreen,Personality Changes for the Bad-Change-Up-Thumbs Down *,2,1 September 2012,"Miserable film with a married guy who has it all- a successful career as an attorney, a beautiful wife and 3 children, the home, etc. and yet he wants to change all that and be like his swinging bachelor friend.The two urinate by a statue and before you know it, they've changed personalities from one to the other. The problem with these type of pictures is that they tend to become somewhat confusing and there is only so much that you can laugh at when the inappropriate times come and they certainly abound here.There is entirely too much profanity here and getting to urinate again to come back to their real selves is ridiculous.",The Change-Up
9,jotix100,"I hate my life, let me have yours!",6,26 July 2012,"Not being happy with one's life presents an excuse for Hollywood's writers to retool a theme that keeps coming back again, and again. Such is the story behind ""The Change-Up"" a funny comedy with a twist. Directed by David Dobkin, and based on a screenplay written by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, we are invited to follow two good friends as they come together to complain about how much they would like to be the other with disastrous results.Dave Lockwood is a married lawyer in Atlanta. He is heading for a promotion in his firm. When Mitch Planko, his best friend, an aspiring porno actor, shows up for drinks at a club, their conversation turns to how their lives have turned out. Dave is a responsible husband and father, whose marriage to Jamie has lost some of its spark because of the caring for three children plus a lot of stress to keep up with the life style he has become used to. Mitch, on the other hand, is a contented, irresponsible individual, who for all appearances seems to be having the time of his life. Mitch seems to be what Dave is not, although not fully happy with himself. Coming out of the bar, after having drunk a lot, go to a fountain in a park to relieve themselves. The two friends make a wish about wanting to be the other as the lights go out.What follow is a formula comedy which was a vehicle for its two stars, Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds, two likable guys who seem to be having a good time making the viewer believe they are these people they are playing. Both actors are personable and versatile comedians. There are laughs as the two men begin to act weird knowing full well they are inside the other's body. Leslie Mann and Olivia Wilde appear as Jamie and Sabrina showing their beauty and baring it all for the fun of it. The great Alan Arkin has a small part as Mitch's father.",The Change-Up
10,anaconda-40658,Change-Up Everything About It.,2,25 August 2015,"The Change-Up (2011): Dir: David Dobkin / Cast: Jason Bateman, Ryan Reynolds, Leslie Mann, Olivia Wilde, Alan Arkin: Dreadful comedy about moving up in responsibility. It is one of those lame body switch rehashes with Jason Bateman as a successful lawyer with a wife and two children, and Ryan Reynolds as a struggling dope smoking actor. After a night on the town they discuss their issues then their bodies switch when they both urinate into a fountain. The rest is fairly predictable and lame. Director David Dobkin previously made another vulgar comedy called The Wedding Crashers. The difference is that film is actually funny while this one is just disgusting. We are given more images of naked children than what a child pornographer could keep up with. Even up close shots of a child's naked ass as sh*t shoots out and into the face and mouth of one of the characters. This is not funny, it's desperate. Even the foul language that is peppered through it comes off as a desperate last take a comedy. Bateman and Reynolds are both capable comic actors who have succeeded in far better films than this. Here they search for the fountain, which has been removed, so that they can urinate in it again and switch back. Leslie Mann is given the thankless role as Bateman's wife, and Olivia Wilde is cardboard as Bateman's co-worker who will be set up on a date with Reynolds. Both females are there for sexual jokes and insults. Alan Arkin plays the father of the Reynolds character and this is not a highlight of his resume. This is a dire comedy that should be pi**ed upon by a group of drunks. Score: 2 / 10",The Change-Up
11,FlashCallahan,Thai Food...,6,10 September 2011,"Mitch and Dave are best friends, but as the years have passed they've slowly drifted apart.While Dave is an overworked lawyer, husband and father of three, Mitch has remained a single, quasi-employed man-child who has never met a responsibility he liked.To Mitch, Dave has it all: beautiful wife Jamie, kids who adore him and a high-paying job at a prestigious law firm.To Dave, living Mitch's stress-free life without obligation or consequence would be a dream come true.Following a drunken night out together, Mitch and Dave's worlds are turned upside down when they wake up in each other's bodies and proceed to freak out.Despite the freedom from their normal routines and habits, the guys soon discover that each other's lives are nowhere near as rosy as they once seemed.....Thw body swap movie is a strange sub-genre. Tom Hanks, Judge Reinhold, and Dudley Moore have all been involved in this prestigious event, but we haven't really seen one in nearly twenty years (the parent trap doesn't count).So it's the turn of the team who gave us hits like Wedding crashers and knocked up, and while this movie is okay, one feels it would have been better if released about five years ago.The cast are good, but when the film depends on swearing and gross out gags, it becomes tiresome very quickly. The jokes are more miss than hit, and come the end, we get the obligatory sweet Hollywood ending.It's no surprise that this film was a bomb, because it doesn't offer anything new, but for ninety minutes, it's amiable stuff.",The Change-Up
12,namashi_1,"Not Hilarious, But Fun Nonetheless!",6,16 February 2015,"'The Change-Up' isn't entirely hilarious or tightly paced, but for the most part, its fun nonetheless! 'The Change-Up' Synopsis: Dave is a married man with two kids and a loving wife, and Mitch is a single man who is at the prime of his sexual life. One fateful night while Mitch and Dave are peeing in a fountain, lightning strikes and they switch bodies.'The Change-Up' works because its Leads, Ryan Reynolds & Jason Bateman, deliver excellent against-type performances. Both of the talented actors lead 'The Change-Up' & add energy & wit to the goings-on, almost managing to distract us from the film's shaky pace & not-all-out-hilarious Writing Material. Bateman, especially, is a riot, enacting his part with absolute flourish.Also mention-worthy are its supporting players. Leslie Mann is exceptional as Bateman's wife. Her sequences are quite memorable, thanks to her impressive act. Olivia Wilde as Bateman's irresistible assistant, is extremely hot & also competent. Alan Arkin as Reynolds's father, is a treasure in a cameo. Director David Dobkin has hit most of the right notes with 'The Change-Up'. Its flawed, but never dull, either. Watchable for sure!",The Change-Up
13,StevePulaski,Could've changed more than just the character's personalities,5,22 August 2011,"The Change-Up bathes in a whole new tub or immaturity and low-brow jokes. Just when you thought The Hangover Part II was the raunchiest piece of film in 2011, casually, but awkwardly walks in this boasting a tiresome eighties formula and off color jokes that twenty years ago would've got you labeled a ""no-class"" citizen.Despite being stamped with an R rating, it seems the humor was targeted toward juvenile twelve year olds who laugh at excessive uses of four letter words and sex references. Boy, this film comes with its share of gratuitous nudity and sexual content. So bad that I'm sure the MPAA was shaking their head when writing down everything this included. I am no prude. I have no problem with language, sex, drugs, or anything. Just as long as it's funny, it has a purpose, and it isn't every ten seconds. The Change-Up doesn't seem to get the fact that swear-humor wares thin.The eighties did away with body-and-mind-swap films, and I think The Change-Up wants to be either nostalgic or clever at resurrecting a tired concept. One body swapping movie I liked to a very stern extent was Dream a Little Dream. It was a true eighties film, but neglected to mention on the back cover and in the trailer it was a convoluted reality-bent film. That's an inexcusable movie on the film's part. At least this tells us what it is blatantly.We meet Mitch (Reynolds) and Dave (Bateman) two best-friends drifting apart because of life's duties. Right off the bat, from that sentence, could've spawned a much smarter and much more interesting film. Lifelong buddies going their separate ways, struggling to hold on, yet constantly fighting, maybe ending in a decent twist. But I don't know if that would be the place to squeeze in so many crude jokes.Anyway, Mitch is a free-spirit man-child who loves to have random sex with a pregnant woman, and Dave has a wife (Mann) and three children. One real girl, and two CGI-ed infants to be exact. One day, they urinate in a fountain and wish they had each other's lives. Boom. Wish comes true and now Mitch is Dave, and Dave is Mitch.They must get used to being in each other's bodies, but then again, both are just as crude and low as the other, the only difference is one actually cares about his family and the only person the other cares about is his pregnant sex-buddy.The problem with The Change-Up is not only that is resurrects a subject that should've remained dead, but the fact that it feels it's ""on a roll"" with its sick humor and deliberately childish antics. We get babies doing their business on Bateman's face, awkward love scenes that could very well tie Bad Teacher for worst sex scene of the year, and we also get enough language to sustain a George Carlin comedy special.This isn't a disaster, but it in no means shines past its roots. The only likable character is Dave's wife played by Leslie Mann who I adored in Funny People. I keep hoping she goes down the path of Amy Adams, and gets herself an Oscar in a future drama role, but The Change-Up certainly couldn't have helped manors.I've said before 2011 is the year of the women with comedies like Bad Teacher, Bridesmaids, and Hall Pass showing that women can be just as funny as men. This film only proves my point that when you have a supporting actress better than the two comedy, typecast leads you should make a film on her rather than them.Starring: Jason Bateman, Ryan Reynolds, and Leslie Mann. Directed by: David Dobkin.",The Change-Up
14,Smells_Like_Cheese,I don't know how this movie is holding a 6.0 + on IMDb,2,9 November 2011,"Two big stars today: Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds, putting them together in a film would be natural for a box office success, even a good movie as they are both decent actors. Even an overused plot of ""let's exchange bodies and find out what your life is like"", been done to death but why not try it with something that has been discussed a million times where why single people want to be married and why married people want to be single again. Now it's not like we haven't all asked this question, I mean it's the most simple answer: Why when we were children did we want to be an adult? Because it's something we think looks great and when it happens you get the good and you get the bad and you sometimes realize maybe the bad outweighs the good and want the good back. So onto the film; I did want to see The Change Up, it seemed like it would try to be a good comedy, boy did it wanna prove me wrong on so many levels.Growing up together, Mitch and Dave are best friends from childhood, as the years have passed, they have slowly drifted apart. Dave is an overworked lawyer, husband and father of three children and Mitch is a single, semi employed man-child who has never met a made a true commitment. To Mitch, Dave has it all: his beautiful wife Jamie, three children who adore him and a high-paying job at a prestigious law firm. To Dave, living Mitch's stress-free life without obligation or consequence would be a dream come true. Following a drunken night out together, Mitch and Dave's worlds are turned upside down when they wake up in each other's bodies and proceed to freak out. Despite the freedom from their normal routines and habits, the guys soon discover that each other's lives are nowhere near as rosy as they once seemed.I love comedies, it's not like I don't have a sense of humor and there were certain parts that made me chuckle. Jason Bateman encouraging his daughter to beat up a school bully and applauding it when she did it on stage during one of her ballet recitals was good. To me, it's just a movie so I can get over the fact that it's the wrong message. However, less than 30 minutes into the film after they exchange lives, there's a soft core porno where they're talking about sticking thumbs into things and it's just way too much and extremely uncomfortable where just uptight Jason Bateman being in a soft core is funny enough why take it to an awkward level? Then I've never ever seen Leslie Mann naked, never thought she was the actress who would do that, oh boy does she do that for a while in the film. Which again, I don't mind nudity, but with her nudity was it necessary? Speaking of unnecessary nudity, what the heck was with the pregnant lady? It seemed like Mitch had some sort of mental issues vs. just not being able to grow up.Why were these two still best friends? I understand growing up, I had great friends when I was a kid, but we went into separate groups, got into different things, that was it and we moved on not talking since we were kids. I have friends now from childhood, but we have things in common still. I also understand that it's hard to break off a friendship, but these two just didn't belong together. They were both uncomfortable with each other and the chemistry was completely off to make it believable where you could see that there was a reason for them still keeping in touch with each other. This movie is just crude and wrong on so many levels that it's not enjoyable, it's more uncomfortable most of the time. I give the movie some credit that it was trying to be funny, it was just given to the wrong people who obviously live Mitch's life more than Dave's. They try to throw in ethics and morals and then the ""appreciate what you have"" message down your throat with a loving family sit-com moment that's just pathetic when this movie has a baby pooping in Jason Bateman's mouth which I'm sure since it's the in the beginning is a metaphor for what the audience is in for when they sit down to this sick movie.2/10",The Change-Up
15,KineticSeoul,Surprisingly decent,6,23 February 2013,"Despite the bashing this movie has gotten, it's actually a funny and entertaining comedy. It depends way too much on crude and messed up humor and has sub-plots that doesn't really have much to do with the core of the story. But it didn't get irritating to watch. The story is basically about two guys who are good friends switching bodies but their mind is intact in different bodies. One is a irresponsible light porn actor that has freedom to do whatever he wants but didn't really achieve much in his life. The other is a family man that has a lot of responsibilities and doesn't have much time to even breath, but has a lot of achievements. But is constantly looking over the fence because he isn't satisfied. And the two characters switch bodies after they pee in a magic fountain. Although the humor is crude it's actually quite funny sometimes. And what both of the characters that switched bodies go through is done well, from each other screwing up each others life to getting it back together. I had very low expectations for this flick but it turned out to be a decent adult comedy.6.5/10",The Change-Up
16,Hellmant,It's not the 80's anymore and Hollywood is still making body changing movies!,6,10 August 2011,"'THE CHANGE-UP': Three Stars (Out of Five)It's not the 80's anymore and Hollywood is still making body changing movies! If you had to make one though who better to cast in it than Ryan Reynolds and Jason Bateman (two of my favorite actors)?! A movie where Reynolds is an unemployed slacker pothead and Bateman is a work obsessed family man who switch bodies actually doesn't sound that bad. It is pretty bad still though for the first half of it's running length. Despite having two of the best funny men in the business, most of the jokes fall a little flat for almost all of the film's setup (Reynolds and Bateman do manage to squeeze some laughs out of the mostly dull material though). Then when the film gets to the cheesy stuff, the heart of the film and the real character development, it actually starts to work! The directing gets a little better, the performances start to shine through and the writing begins to polish itself out. It takes half a film to get there but 'THE CHANGE-UP' is mostly worth the effort.The film is directed by David Dobkin (who also directed the popular buddy films 'WEDDING CRASHERS' and 'SHANGHAI KNIGHTS'). It's written by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore (part of the team behind 'THE HANGOVER'). All of the ingredients are there for the perfect juvenile male bonding adventure but I think the 'body switching' formula kind of dooms the film a little from the start (at least in the start). It revolves around two best friends, Mitch (Reynolds) and Dave (Bateman), who have grown apart due to their lives taking vastly different paths. Both men envy the other though and when they wish for each other's lives while pissing in a fountain one night their wishes come true. Leslie Mann (otherwise known as Mrs. Apatow) and Olivia Wilde co-star as the men's two love interests, one is Dave's wife and the other is his co-worker. Things of course get very complicated and trouble ensues (which then of course leads to emotional evolvement and surprisingly strong character growth).The film really does make you care for it's two lead characters and watching their emotional growth does really work. That's thanks in part to the directing and somewhat well written screenplay but more so Reynold's and Bateman's performances (I think). They've proved that they not only have a knack for comedic timing but also dramatic chops when given the right material as well. With this film when the drama kicks in the comedy also picks up and flows better. At first the jokes are pretty standard and overused (they're also extremely crude and disturbing) but as the characters start to get more interesting and involving the jokes get funnier and more meaningful as well. If you're a Ryan Reynolds or Jason Bateman fan (or a fan of body switching movies) you'll almost certainly enjoy this film at least some what, despite it's rocky take off.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXu8bs0LI9A",The Change-Up

18,Robert_duder,"Not your Mama's Freaky Friday, hilarious and fun but R rated to the core",8,14 January 2012,"I am not one to promote or even enjoy gross out crude comedies and they are a dime a dozen nowadays. Its too easy for film makers in the Judd Apatow world to show private body parts, vomit, bodily functions and pass it off as comedy. But every once in awhile it is done right or even decently okay and it can make you laugh despite being crude. The Change Up is raunchy. There is no ifs ands or butts about it. You don't get much raunchier than this but its also fun and will make you laugh despite yourself and the performances of the lead cast are excellent and the chemistry just works really well. This is probably the first body swap comedy to go full on R-rated so good for them for mixing it up because any comparisons to Freaky Friday are lost because this is about as far away from Disney as you can get.I think the success of this film completely lays on the backs of the two stars Ryan Reynolds and Jason Bateman. Both of them are hilarious on their own and together. They do a good job of playing each other and they make it believable. I think if I had to pick one of them as topping the other Bateman probably turned in the best performance but both are great. Leslie Mann, who seems to love gross out comedies...oh right she's Apatows wife...plays Bateman's wife Jamie. She does a good job, has some funny moments in the movie and even adds a little bit of emotion. I think she's a versatile actress and while she doesn't shine in the film, she does a good job. Once again Olivia Wilde squeezes herself into a movie where she isn't really necessary. I don't know why but I liked her on House and then ever since I find her annoying and just in the way all the time. Her and Reynolds have okay chemistry but I still could have done without her character. Alan Arkin makes a small cameo that is sort of fun but isn't big enough to make any notes of.Director David Dobkin seems to know comedy well and I think he lets the talent of Reynolds and Bateman carry the movie and that's all it takes to be a good solid comedy. Once again I re-iterate that if you offend easily steer clear of this one because it is crude and unapologetic. Still for a guilty pleasure, this one is fun and outrageous and the shock comedy happens to work this time around. Fans of this style of comedy (Knocked Up, 40 Year Old Virgin, Superbad etc) will love this and for good reason. Chemistry saves the day! 8/10",The Change-Up

So they throw in some bad language, some boobs, and gross situations and you have a laughing riot of a time, right? Wrong, this was gross and the plot is just old to be funny to me.

21,The-Sarkologist,Better Body Swap Films Around,4,30 August 2021,"This movie felt like an Adam Sandler movie with Ryan Renolds as opposed to Adam Sandler, though I have to admit that most of Sandler's movies do tend to be a little more down to Earth, whereas this one is basically a body swap film. I was sort of wandering how they were going to execute it, but the thing is that the two characters are completely different - one a high flying lawyer, the other an out of work actor and can really only get roles in Lorn (I'll let you work that one out for yourself).So, as I mentioned, it is a body swap, and the lawyer is just swamped with his family and wishes that he could live the free and easy life, while the actor desires to actually have a family. As with a lot of these movies, they make a wish and it ends up coming true. Mind you, they make a wish while taking a leak in a fountain, and not surprisingly the very next day, after they discover that they have swapped bodies, the fountain has disappeared.Look, the film was okay, but it is one of those films that certainly does try to push the boundaries, and honestly, some of the boundaries that they pushed certainly didn't need to be pushed. Yet, in another sense, it does capture the life of a young family in a way that many films don't - warts and all - even if it might be going a little over board in places. Look, I do quite like Ryan Reynolds, and Jason Bateman isn't bad either (even though some of his films are pretty bad - looking in the direction of Horrible Bosses), but this film certainly doesn't seem to hit the mark.I guess the theme behind this film really comes down to being careful what you wish for. But in another sense it does work both ways. Yeah, there is an element of not realising how good you have something until it is gone, but it also has an element of letting your life pass you by to the point that you simply don't learn how to enjoy it. The characters, as I mentioned, can't be the more opposite - one doesn't commit, the other is over committed. One doesn't realise the joy of a committed relationship, a steady job, and a purpose, while the other doesn't give himself any time to simply enjoy life.Yeah, I do have to admit that there are some good elements in this film, but it isn't as if there aren't other films out there that follow the same course. However, as I mentioned, it isn't one of the greatest, and there is probably a reason that I only found out about it when the Netflix algorithm pointed it out to me.",The Change-Up

24,Floated2,Not too funny or original but solid,6,2 March 2013,"Watching the trailer one can already tell what kind of film this would be. It is an R rated film and it deserves that rating. Much criticism is based on the rating.Take away the parts that try too hard to be transgressive, and what we're left with is the same old walk-a-mile-in-another-man's-shoes morality play, courtesy of a magic MacGuffin. In this case, Dave -- who wishes he were more like his pot-smoking, carefree, man-child actor buddy Mitch (Ryan Reynolds) -- urinates simultaneously with his pal in a fountain under a magic statue (I kid you not). And their souls switch stations.So it is that Mitch discovers being married to a hot babe (Leslie Mann) who's a mother of three, may mean not having sex very often or at all. His bullish entrance into Dave's workplace -- a high-end legal office where an improperly tied Windsor knot is grounds for reprimand -- is his worst nightmare come true (and a setup for predictable dude-meets- uptight-boardroom antics).Dave, meanwhile, finds out Mitch's idyllic existence is a bit of a sham. His big-time acting job is in a soft-core porn film (where he must simulate sex with an older woman with fake boobs and a joker-like face job), while his weekly booty call is with -- well, we already said it -- a pregnant woman.Act 1: fish-out-of-water-based hilarity. Act 2: epiphany, as Mitch/Dave acquires responsibility and learns he loves his estranged dad (Alan Arkin), while Dave/Mitch learns to loosen up. Cue the redemptive last act.It's not that I didn't chuckle a couple of times (mostly at the scenes that involved the tossing and general mishandling of babies, guilty laughs to be sure), but they were far outnumbered by moments that just felt awkward or uncomfortable.",The Change-Up

The idea behind the movie was good, and seemed entertaining enough to make a great comedy, however the film never reaches that level. Half way through the movie, it gets boring, as the two protagonist start to evaluate their lives and start to ""grow up"". After that the whole story becomes so messed up, that the ending is not even satisfying, let alone too predictable.

26,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Never totally escapes the predictability, but does a decent job skirting it",5,5 August 2011,"Oh, the body-swap comedy. You know how it starts, you know how it ends and frankly, you know most of what's in between. To name an R-rated buddy version of this formula ""The Change-Up"" is essentially serving up a thick slice of irony, yet somehow ""The Hangover"" writers Jon Lucas and Scott Moore and ""Wedding Crashers"" director David Dobkin manage to change just enough to prevent predictability from drowning their film entirely.The film starts neck deep, however. Jason Bateman's character Dave wakes up bright and early thanks to his newborn twins, one of which projectile poos all over his face. Gross-out humor might be one of the worst ways to start a modern comedy, but somehow ""The Change-Up"" manages to recover thanks to a strong cast and writing that works when it's not trying too hard to be funny.Dave and Mitch (Ryan Reynolds) are old friends with opposite lifestyles that predictably wish they could have what the other has. Dave has been an achiever all through his life and never stopped to enjoy himself in the ways of drugs and women, for example. That would be typical bachelor Mitch's life. Mitch, on the other hand, would love for even a modicum of success and stability. Plug in a magic fountain activated by two different simultaneous urine streams and voila — body-swapping comedy.Thus begins the journey of the two friends toward the inevitable learning not to take for granted the lives they have. To be fair, Lucas and Moore write in some scenes that break convention. Early on, for example, there's the scene when they try and convince Dave's wife (Leslie Mann) that they've switched bodies by telling her to ask Dave (in Mitch's body) a question only he would know. Seen that before, right? Rather than she predictably believing them, things take a comic turn when Dave reveals a very private detail about her.When ""The Change-Up"" isn't forcing in Farrelly brothers-inspired gross-out humor, it's a decent comedy. For one, the writing from a non-jokes standpoint has surprising strength. At several moments the film goes down some more dramatic side streets that feel natural because the characters have just enough depth for us to care. Mann's performance in particular helps this along — she's far from the typical mother/wife figure in a buddy comedy.By establishing a bit of a routine in that Mitch in Dave's body must try and prevent Dave's law firm's merger from falling through while also balancing a family life and Dave in Mitch's body must simply get laid in a strange matter of ways, the story doesn't spiral out of control. The focus stays mostly on Mitch in Dave's body as he's the significantly less shallow character with more going on. Bateman takes advantage, transforming himself with a terrific number of quirks, which he's done so well in his career. On a number of occasions, however, the way you'd expect a character to behave and how they actually behave don't match up, which definitely hurts the ability to get caught up in the story, but there's a logic to the sequence of events and as such, natural jokes evolve that counteract the bad ones to some extent.Somehow the writing manages to hit on points of sentimentality as well. Despite the inevitability of the outcomes, the story arcs of the characters make good use of this tired concept as they drift from hating the change to embracing it to the realization that they truly appreciate their own lives. Some thought definitely went into character motivation, otherwise we'd feel nothing. Dobkin captured the same thing in ""Wedding Crashers,"" but the difference here is obviously the novelty factor. As such, a film can never outrun predictability. It can be taken advantage of as best as the talents involved possibly can, but it always wins.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",The Change-Up
27,lisafordeay,Hilarious movie with Ryan Reynolds but very rude,5,23 November 2013,"The Change Up is a body swapping comedy about two men,one whom is a loving dotting father named Dave(played by Jason Bateman) who is fed up with his life as his wife (played by Leslie Mann from George of the jungle)is always whining and always has Dave minding the twins,while the other is a porn actor called Mitch(played by Ryan Reynolds)who enjoys getting it on with women. But their lives will change forever when they leak into a fountain one night and wish to swap each other's lives,leading them to swap places. Now Mitch is Dave,and Dave is Mitch and they have to try and find the fountain in order to go back to their normal lives. But can they really pull off as each other.Overall this film is hilarious. The comedy is rude and hilarious and im not really a fan of rude comedies except for Dumb & Dumber as that is my favourite comedy of all time but this one was really(and I mean) REALLY RUDE and disgusting.If you are a fan of Reynolds and sex comedies with A lot of nudity then check it out. Keep your ears open for the Chuck music theme(starring Zachary Levi) in this film near the middle half of the film.Overall its a 5 out of 10 for the film and the comedy gets a 6 out of ten. 5.6 out of 10.",The Change-Up
28,Turfseer,Only one half of this body swap 'bromance' tickles the funny bone,4,18 October 2013,"'The Change-Up' is an occasionally amusing farce involving two life-long friends who by sleight of hand, end up in one another's bodies. The big 'switch' occurs after a night of 'bromancing', where the two friends both find themselves urinating in front of a statue fountain, whose visage reminds one vaguely of the Statue of Liberty. The Statue appears to have some magical powers, which causes the transformation.Jason Bateman plays the 'straight' friend, Dave Lockwood, a workaholic attorney who is married with three kids in the suburbs. Ryan Reynolds plays Mitch Planko, his offbeat, somewhat vulgar friend, who provides the comic relief.Clearly the far more entertaining character is Mitch, who is continually pushing boundaries from the outset. So when Mitch becomes Dave, Dave has the much better part. We get to see how Mitch as Dave, upsets Dave's world. The humor comes from the fish out of water premise: Mitch simply doesn't fit into Dave's world—but somehow, in the end, he manages to improve it.For example, he eventually convinces the CEO of Dave's company to play hardball with a rival Japanese company, during a mediation, and Dave's company ends up making out like bandits. On the personal level, Mitch as David hilariously convinces Dave's daughter to meet 'violence with violence', so she retaliates after a school bully knocks her down during a ballet performance.Unfortunately when David pretends to be Mitch, there is no comic equivalence. The whole idea is that David needs to slow down and adopt Mitch's spontaneous lifestyle. There's nothing funny when he's forced to be aloof during Mitch's porno shoot, or the trip to the Aquarium or relaxing, watching a DVD of 'Animal House'. And there are also no laughs when he starts dating Sabrina, Dave's sexy colleague at work, where he finally learns to become more spontaneous.Mitch as Dave also falls into line, becoming more responsible as a good parent and eventually reconciling with his father, by attending his father's wedding. So by the end of the film, the best friends learn their valuable life lessons, but whatever humor was generated earlier, with the real Mitch doing his shtick and then Mitch as David doing his thing, is lost. Dave or Dave as Mitch, was never funny in the first place (regardless of the absurd 'poop attack' by Dave's infant, at the beginning of the film).A good part of 'The Change-Up' also relies on bathroom humor which has limited appeal. One particular scene that fails to fire is the big buildup for Dave's wife when she enters the bedroom, only to end up in the bathroom on the toilet, concentrating on a series of difficult bowel movements.In the end, this is a film that is mildly amusing in spots. Somehow if Dave also had some more significant idiosyncrasies like Mitch, this would have been a funnier film.",The Change-Up

30,mattkratz,vulgar yet surprisingly funny,8,26 December 2012,"This was a raunchy entry in the ""Freaky Friday"" series of movies. Jason Baterman is a workaholic lawyer who is married with twin infants, while his best friend from childhood Ryan Reynolds is a man-child who is an aspiring actor who avoids responsibility at every turn and has never held down a job in his life. Both men envy each other's lives and make no secret of it. One evening,while urinating in a fountain, they wish they had each other's lives aloud, lightning strikes the fountain, and the next morning they wake up in each other's bodies. (kind of like Big!) They soon find out that the grass isn't as green after all.I loved the scenes where the wife and the father talk to them, not knowing that they are talking to the characters in each others' bodies. (does that make sense?) Ryan Reynolds' scenes are the raunchiest & grossest, which I'm sure was intentional on part of the movie makers. I loved his scenes with Olivia Wilde. His scenes of Jason Bateman's character in his body were like an adolescent's dream come true.I probably wouldn't recommend this if you have children or someone just entering the teen year unless are accompanying them due to the ""gross gags."" The tone is pretty much set at the start when Bateman's kid poops on his face at the start. However, there are plenty of other good scenes (read:decent) and laugh-out-loud jokes. It was good.

Also, Leslie Mann is hilarious and I think underrated at times for how good she is.This's is a streamer.

Now following separate path one leads a family life alongside Jamie (Leslie Mann) and a trio of dastardly children (including demonic baby twins and a bum-whooping ballerina). Meanwhile Mitch fails to follow through on anything in his life - the eternal quitter now entertaining women through the easiest job possible. After the drunken night both of them declare their admiration of the other's life while peeing into a fountain presided over by a stony statue of the Greek goddess Metis. The following morning - it's ""Freaky Friday"" on crack...Inexplicably construed around a vulgarly obscene script lacking any of the gutsy wisecracking charm of ""Role Models"", but all of the toilet humour prevalent in the lowest grade comedies. Unmistakenly and fortunately R-rated it features tirades of miscued crassness with scenes of poop farting munchkins, extremely irresponsible parenting and unimaginative build-up. As if led by the misguided belief that funny equals farts and profane language the real laughs are scarce both in quantity as well as quality. The main benefit of ""The Change Up"" derives from the undeniable lure of Bateman and Reynolds forced to play against character and the awkwardness it entails. This unequivocally does lead to some endearing scenes shouldered on the characters allure and a well-deserved conclusion, but the overall lewdness over laughs dilutes any real viewing satisfaction.",The Change-Up

It's Ryan Reynolds and Jason Bateman for crying out loud. If you've ever liked anything they've ever done (aside from ""Green Lantern"") then you'll probably like this. Seeing them do ""impressions"" of each other is a bonus.As far as ""body swapping"" goes, I think this is the only non-parent child, non-male female swap that I've seen, which is probably what makes it a lot of fun: there's no socio-political debate sitting in the background on single vs married, but all the fun of ""now I have to deal with THIS"". Maybe there are some issues of how redeemable the characters are in their flaw sets, but it's built into the premise.With Leslie Mann and Olivia Wilde backing up the leads, everyone gives a stellar performance. The production value is clearly there, though I think most of it went into locations and cast budgets: this isn't an action-car-chase movie, it's a ""body swap"" dirt humor rom com.The writing does skew dirty in the humor, but if you have an open mind, then the humor ends up being in the surprise of dealing with each others lives unprepared.

36,brando647,"All Shock Value and No Substance, Some Laughs",7,3 January 2012,"THE CHANGE-UP, directed by David Dobkin, does something so few movies I've seen ever do. It actually gets worse each time I watch it. I guess that sounds harsh, but it's true. Each time I watch the movie, I have a harder time figuring out what I thought was so funny the first time. If I'd rated it after my first viewing, I guarantee it would've been higher. The movie is essentially an R-rated version of a movie we've seen a hundred times before: an identity swap. Jason Bateman is the straight man, a married lawyer with three kids who's on the verge of making partner at his firm. Ryan Reynolds is the slacker, a stoned out wannabe actor who makes a living with the occasional commercial or ""lorno"" (cable-level softcore porn). Each of them has something to envy in regards to the other man's life: Mitch (Reynolds) yearns for his friend's success, while Dave (Bateman) wants his friend's total freedom. One night, after having a few beers, the two wander across a statue in the park and stop for a quick leak. The two unanimously wish they had the other man's life and BAM, the next morning they've swapped bodies. You know how it goes from here: Mitch has to try and not mess up Dave's marriage and potential promotion, while Dave struggles with his desire to sleep around and whether or not it still constitutes as cheating on his wife if it's not his body. Minor laughs ensue.When the very first scene in the movie has a baby crapping in Jason Bateman's mouth, it pretty much sets the standard for the next two hours. The rest of the movie relies on toilet humor, nudity (which isn't always a bad thing, though the ladies here are all digitally-enhanced), and plot turns you can see coming a mile away. The problem with doing yet another rendition of the body-swapping story we've seen a hundred times before is that we've seen it a hundred times before. We know what's going to happen. Each of them will be thrown into drastically different situations than they're accustomed to, they'll struggle, and eventually they'll learn something important about their own lives. The end, roll credits. What matters in these sort of movies is the filler in between the predictable plot points, and the sad fact of the matter is there really isn't anything more here than shock value laughs. The lorno shoot, Mitch juggling the babies precariously in the kitchen in the midnight feeding scene, Leslie Mann's thai food surprise, etc. There aren't a whole lot of jokes, just a bunch of stuff that's shockingly amusing. Unfortunately, we become desensitized after a while and they become less and less amusing. Just because a movie is R-rated doesn't mean the humor needs to rely on fart jokes and the occasional nipple.I really wanted this movie to be funny. An R-rated spin on what's primarily been a PG-rated theme was a cool plan, and the cast assembled for the movie should've been just what it needed. Jason Bateman's always hilarious and Ryan Reynolds has the potential to be great in a movie (as long as it's a comedy and he's not wearing green CGI spandex). Leslie Mann is tried and true, and Olivia Wilde is gorgeous and I was curious to see how she'd do at comedy after enjoying her work on TV's ""House"" for so long. But in the end, none of it came together like it was supposed to. The movie ended up being a forgettable flop that will fall off of the cast's resumes soon enough, I'm sure. If you truly want to get the most of this movie, watch it only once. The less sober, the better. That ought to leave you with pleasant enough memories of the movie that a second viewing would probably only ruin. Its flaws start to come forward once the shock value has worn off. The middle section of the film is way too long and the two friends spend way too much time in each other's bodies. If the filmmakers had managed to cut the movie about a half hour shorter, streamlined the whole thing and jacked up the pace a little, it would've probably been a major improvement. Oh, and one final note, they really should've changed the title. I can't express how much I don't like the title of the film. It truly sounds like they'd run out of ideas for ""body-swap"" movie titles and cobbled this one together at the last minute.",The Change-Up

Two very different guys with very different lifestyles, who fail trying to adopt to the other. I won't lie, the film is quite entertaining and some of the gags aren't even bad, it's just that we've seen this plot a million times and the quite unlikely term of urinating into a fountain doesn't make it a lot better. Thus, the movie ranges somewhere between a cheap box office success and a film to switch off your brain.All in all this is nothing you have to see, but it can be an entertaining piece for a boring evening or if you're really not looking for anything clever and thoughtful.",The Change-Up

41,TheUnknown837-1,"""The Change-Up"" is now forerunner, and will likely claim the title as the worst movie of 2011",1,5 November 2011,"Gene Siskel, the late film critic for the Chicago Tribune once said that there was nothing more depressing to be found at the movies than a comedy without a single laugh. Having suffered through the agonizing hour and fifty-three minutes of gratuitous masturbation, flatulence, and on-camera human defecation (all meant to be humorous, by the way) that made up the dreadful ""The Change-Up,"" I can confidently state that he was right. 2011 has not been the best year for the motion pictures, but even in the worst that I've seen this year (""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" ""Atlas Shrugged: Part I,"" ""Darkening Sky,"" ""Shark Night,"" need I go on) there was at least one redeeming factor to be found. A scene or two, or perhaps a performance that was coherent enough to warrant a positive footnote. That is not the case here.Here, Hollywood seems to have blended a trend from the 1980s with a trend of the new millennium. The former being a comedy where two people switch bodies and try to live each other's lives, the latter being the most disgustingly unfunny methods to produce pseudo-hip comedy. Jason Bateman plays a family man with a wife and three children, but is far more devoted to his job as a big-shot lawyer. His lifelong pal is played by Ryan Reynolds as a total loser bent on sex and porno and making his feature debut in a soft-core movie. One night, after a few hours at a bar, they (I kid you not) urinate into a fountain which, of course, has a magical statue of a goddess in it, wish they had each other's lives, and voila! They wake up the next morning, appalled to be each other, find out how hard each other's lives was, and all the other cliché checkpoints of the body-switcheroo formula.Exhausted as I am with that sort of film, I would have accepted it had it been clean-minded and courageous enough to attempt genuine humor. But what it offers instead is absolutely revolting. I knew after the first five minutes that ""The Change-Up"" was going to be horrendous, when (I still kid you not) one of Mr. Bateman's twin babies defecates into his mouth and we see the whole process from a shot of the baby's rump. And it was exactly that sort of humor that followed for the rest of the picture and not once did I laugh. I never cracked a smile, I never found myself moved by the obligatory, would-be touching moments, and I was no more interested to hear the sounds of Mr. Reynolds or Leslie Mann (as Mr. Batman's wife) defecating, either. And a would-be comedic moment (another one, yes) with Mr. Reynolds's encounter with a pregnant slattern made my stomach turn. The only near-complimentary thing about the content is that it holds men and children with just as much disregard and distaste as it does women.Feel like heaving, yet? Now you have a clue how I felt the entire time I was watching this horrendously awful film.""The Change-Up,"" which was limply directed by David Dobkin and written by ""The Hangover"" duo-screenwriters Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, also 'triumphs' at taking deservedly accomplished actors and actresses and making them look woodenly untalented. Mr. Reynolds and Mr. Bateman, in either personality, have about as much chemistry together as two chewed-up pencils on a kindergartener's desktop, and act with even less conviction. Leslie Mann, a usually beguiling actress, only succeeds at producing the psychological equivalent of fingernails going down a chalkboard. Olivia Wilde, an actress I have praised on many occasions, looks as good as she ever has, but gives a frighteningly amateurish performance as well. Even Alan Arkin - Alan Arkin, of all people! - does not produce anything worth a positive comment.This film clocks in at just under two hours and it felt so much longer than that. I started looking at my watch at the twenty-minute mark and I routinely checked it over and over again and when at last the credits finally started to roll, I jumped away from my DVD player, walked into the middle of my dorm room, stretched my hands into the air, spun on my heels, and exclaimed ""Hallelujah! Hallelujah!"" The torture was finally over and would never, ever have to revisit it again. Not only was I bored, but I was angry. And what bothered me even more was that I had only seen the theatrical version; on the DVD there is an unrated copy as well. I shudder to imagine what extra 'content' could possibly have been added to its revolting, stomach-flipping clunk of misanthropic garbage.""The Change-Up"" is now forerunner, and will likely claim the title, as the worst movie of 2011.",The Change-Up

All turns more dumb than funny and more lazy than cliche. More cash grap than entertainment. This idea COULD work, but its probably more appropriate for a SNL sketch.

43,aciessi,A Great Stupid Time,8,27 September 2012,"The Change-Up is an undeniably stupid comedy, but it is also an enjoyable one. For many other viewers, a comedy based on the worn out premise of body switching seems tacky, making it R- Rated just seems grounds for disaster. I have to admit the first five minutes of the picture made me a little weary. Its not a particularly funny moment to see a baby projectile defecate into Jason Bateman's mouth. But I sat and gave this movie a chance, and to my surprise i really enjoyed it. It has some really funny R-Rated moments that I wasn't expecting to see, and quite a few brilliant one-liners. I understand all the bad flack surrounding this film. Its not for everyone's taste. If you can leave your brain at the door, you could enjoy this movie.",The Change-Up
44,jon.h.ochiai,Hysterical with Heart,9,14 August 2011,"I was surprised. ""The Change-Up"" is great. Ryan Reynolds and Jason Bateman are amazing. Yes, this movie premise has been done before like ""Big"" or ""Disney's The Kid"". Reynolds and Bateman's characters switch bodies in some sort of cosmic twist, after wishing each had the other's life while urinating in a fountain. The predictable epiphany: Each man has appreciation for the other's life, and renewed respect. However, the screenplay by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore (writers of ""The Hangover"") is not nearly so trite, and more profound in ambition.The beginning of the movie is kind of a red herring; given the f-bomb laden language and the projectile baby poop. I think that the advertising as an edgy gross out comedy misrepresents, and perhaps dilutes the true appeal. True, the question: ""Whose penis does that belong to?"" is not what we are left with; although it is funny. What if you got to see your life through another person, and through those that love him? Two scenes resonate. Body switched Reynolds listens to Dave's wife Jamie (funny and touching Leslie Mann) tearfully tell him that Dave no longer desires her. She confesses that Dave is a good man, who wants ""more, more"": promotion, second house, more kids. How can she be with ""someone who isn't happy?"" She is really confessing to Dave. Reynolds is brilliant in his humility. Mitch's Dad (great Alan Arkin) asks to see body switched Bateman for a favor. Mitch Sr. tells Dave that he loves his son, but that Mitch is a quitter. He quits everything in his life. He is really talking to Mitch. Bateman reflects the hurt in his eyes. This is offset by the hysterical scenes throughout. Mitch as Dave insults Japanese Senior Partner Kinkabe (stoic Lo Ming) during merger negotiation. Dave as Mitch tells the stunning Sabrina (captivating Olivia Wilde), ""I haven't heard I word you said, since you took off your pants"" Director David Dobkin (""Wedding Crashers"") uses a deceptive smoke screen: the blatant offensive humor. Underneath it all, ""The Change-Up"" is about the most important things in life—love, friendship, and family. In a touching and ridiculous story arc, Reynolds tells Bateman, ""I'm proud of you"" In a roundabout way, ""The Change-Up"" is about seeing the best in people, by keeping the past in the past. Reynolds and Bateman make this work seamlessly. Theirs is a true partnership. They are not imitating or mocking the other in the narrative body switch. You get the feel that they are authentically embodying the other's perceived persona.Leslie Mann is whimsical, sexy, and strong as Jamie-- the movie's emotional anchor. The ""Thai food"" joke from the trailer is way hotter in the movie. Mann is genius in balancing heartbreak and humor. Whether she is looking at Bateman singing the ""dinner song""—he has no clue or holding hostage the babysitter with her story of her marriage woes. Olivia Wilde is stunningly gorgeous with impeccable comedic timing. She plays Sabrina, the legal assistant at Dave's law firm. She goes out to dinner with Reynolds, and tells him that she had a crush on Dave—he is really Dave. Later in a hysterical exchange, she says, ""Are you breaking up with me?"" She is joking.So the story ensues, Mitch (Reynolds) and Dave (Bateman) spiritually exchange bodies after urinating in a fountain with an eerie statue. Dave is the workaholic attorney hoping to make partner with his firm after managing a huge merger case for his firm. He lives in a great home, has a beautiful wife Jamie (Mann) and daughter Cara (cute Sydney Rouviere) and twin babies Peter and Sarah (Luke and Lauren Bain). Mitch is the single struggling actor, who lives in a loft. Mitch has an awesome sex life. However, Mitch and Dave discover the fountain has been moved to a different location in the city. They don't know yet where. In the meantime, Mitch must complete Dave's big case with his partnership at stake. Dave must fulfill Mitch's role in ""lorn"", low grade soft porn, which requires Dave to perform the unthinkable with his thumb. There is also the sexual quandary. Mitch is now Dave, and sleeping with Jamie. Dave is now Mitch, going out with Sabrina, who always yearned for married Dave.Writers Lucas and Moore are bold and brilliant when half way through Mitch and Dave tell Jamie about the body switch. She hysterically dismisses them. So there is no idiot-plot here, at least out right. The crass comedy and the narrative catharsis don't always meld throughout. But hang in there. Reynolds, Bateman, Mann, and Wilde are awesome. ""The Change-Up"" veers wildly at times, but it has its heart in the right place.",The Change-Up
45,spookyrat1,Get a Charge-Up!,6,13 March 2020,"There's absolutely nothing new to be said storywise about The Change-Up. It's the same identity/personality switch narrative you've seen before going right back to films such as Trading Places, with many of the same inherent challenges to be faced and overcome by our protagonists, before the regulation switchback at the end. The one big difference with The Change-Up is that it features the grossest, LOL, humour that I've ever seen in this sort of film. Subtle it is not. The production team clearly sought an R rating. A broad sense of humour is required to enjoy it. If you lack that sort of attribute, be advised to stay well away.That said, I obviously enjoyed it, as likely did Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds, life-long best friends, who switch bodies and completely opposite lifestyles, after some mumbo-jumbo involving a city-wide blackout and some sort of magic fountain. Leslie Mann and Olivia Wilde demonstrate they are both great sports and we thankfully see their roles become more enhanced during the back half of the movie. Alan Arkin even pops up for a few brief scenes as (we presume) a much married father of Ryan Reynolds's, slacker Lothario, Mitch.A couple of observations. As stated though working well together, it is a little difficult, despite his funny hair cut, of accepting Ryan Reynolds as the same age as Jason Bateman which is one of the main narrative points. Bateman's a good-looking guy, but clearly has got quite a few years on Reynolds. The other thing is that it's difficult to see where $50+million dollars has gone, except perhaps in star salaries. It's just one of those films you look at and wonder how did it cost so much to put together.Predictable though it is, The Change-Up still manages to provide plenty of fun for the flexibly liberal viewer.",The Change-Up

The actors are awesome; Ryan Reynolds is perfect as always and there's enough storyline, heart and humor to keep you watching for more. This show isn't going to be deep, or exciting, it might be predictable as most R rated comedies are; but that's not the reason why you watch an R rated comedy.

47,deatman9,Not original but funny anyways.,7,22 November 2012,This movie really does not have the most original idea hell its probably one of the most overdone ideas in movie history but I think this one is by far the best. It has a lot of clever funny moments in it while I wish it would have stuck with more of those and left out some of the gross out funny it was still a good watch.This movie is about two best friends who grew up all their lives the same and now adults one is a lazy wanna be actor who sits at home all day and gets stoned while the other is a very successful lawyer with a huge house and a wife and kids. One day when peeing in a water fountain they wish for each others lives and when they wake up the next day they realize it has happened.This movie was good but its definitely not for everyone. Like I said it is funny but a lot of the humor comes from gross out humor which I really was not a big fan of but I still like this movie.,The Change-Up
48,Christian_Dimartino,"There are times that are really funny, and really gross, and grossly funny, and I think that they work here.",8,29 December 2011,"The Change up has got a heart and a premise of a family film(Freaky Friday is where i'm going off of that), but the mind and humor of a Farrelly Brothers film. Does the combination work here? Well, I guess you'd have to see it for yourself.Dave and Mitch(Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds) are two completely different guys, who are best friends. Dave is a lawyer family man, while Mitch is a stoner and aspiring actor, who is also a womanizer. Both envy each other's lives, so after peeing in a fountain, they switch lives. Now until they find the fountain they peed in, they have to maintain each others lives with great caution.There are a lot of gross out moments here, like the baby projectile crapping on someone's face, and a porn shoot with an old plastic woman(plastic from surgery), and those are pretty shocking. But I thought it was funny. I also think it's funny to see Bateman in this role. Because usually we picture him as the nice one, which he's supposed to be. But once he switches with Rerynolds, that completely changes.The change up isn't a great movie, but it's a fun one, and a funny one if not disgusting one. The actors must have had a lot of fun here, and so do we.I'm saying see it, but not everyone has the dirty mind that I do.B+",The Change-Up

50,Horror-yo,Better than you think. Seriously.,8,29 December 2017,"Metascores and the cinema ""specialist"" clique will only rate a comedy if it's cynical, tries really hard to be clever and above everything else. So if a comedy comes across as obviously too mainstream, as having a ""boring redundant same old chorus"" of a ""predictable"" moral at the end and feels genuine and positive, then it's a complete failure and waste of time.Looking at the premise, the poster and the kind of promotion this film has brought upon itself you'd think it was only good for one laugh while half-wasted, and that's it. But that's just not the case.It immediately establishes that it's going to be that comedy that actually gave a darn and put effort into writing the jokes. We're not fed tripe, there's a real spirit in the humor here - and Reynolds as always provides his own quality touch where if you've seen him a couple of times before you know he's added some of the lines himself. The film is pretty swift at establishing the characters, some of the tensions, and delivering the premise straight away without messing around. And as that happens, as the two leads swap bodies and roles, we're given a realistic depiction onscreen of what that would really be like, the film doesn't just go right for the completely goofy ridiculous scenes and as it progresses, it's actually well acted out, well scripted, very well paced and, impressively mature. This was genuinely given some thought on where to go from A to B to C, so on, from the introductory setup to the later stages. Sure there's a little bit of improbable plot magic, but it's kept in check commendably well: a vast majority of what's going on makes sense and rings true. And where such a film usually pushes way too hard on the humor eventually, this keeps it fresh and interesting every time it should've crashed considering its category.A special mention to Leslie Mann who does surprisingly well (!). She helps convey key emotions for the plot and delivers in pivotal scenes that could've turned to trash very easily. Instead, there's real purpose and significance to those scenes, and she in particular did really well. The film poses questions as you'd expect from such a synopsis: two guys, mutually polar opposites, switch lives...surely they discover how much they loved their old regular life, but also the infatuating prospect of falling right into the perfect framework created by the other where all those new options are available...It's funny from start to finish, really funny in parts - it's full of twists and turns, nowhere near the linear development one would think; and it's totally coherent and fluid.
I'm going to go out of my way here, and actually give this a proper 8/10. For its kind, it's one of the best I've ever seen and could hope to watch.",The Change-Up

Always crass and swearing, he actually does pretty good when he's more serious. I enjoyed the movie, not really any surprises but crude doesn't always mean laughs. I wanted it to be much funnier.

I also don't like scenes like the one with the poop, it's unrealistic and gross. Btw, the scene with the baby banging his head was so obviously not real, they should have just skipped it.As for originality, I agree it's been done before but so what? The cast was good and the story was funny so I don't really mind that. I think we all want to change lives sometimes but if it really happened I'm pretty sure a lot of us would want our own life back because no life is as perfect as we sometimes perceive it to be. That's what's really funny. The little details we seem to forget or not pay attention to (not the amount of hair we have on our private parts).This movie has it all for better and for worse but as a comedy it's not that bad, it's entertaining enough.

So now Dave is in Mitch's body, and Mitch is in Dave's body. Then, the next thing you know, Mitch as Dave screws up with the family and his law job, and Dave as Mitch experiences the bachelor life, while hooking up with his long-time crush, his new law partner named Sabrina, portrayed by Olivia Wilde. Now, all I can say is that the movie isn't that bad! There is actually better expectations when this movie provides a funny script with a heart, and two hilarious performances by Bateman and Reynolds. Bateman and Reynolds are one of the best buddies in a buddy film I have ever seen on the big screen. They provide a friendly chemistry, and it was nice to see these two faces in a movie. Leslie Mann is pleasant as Dave's wife, Alan Arkin has some light-hearted scenes as Mitch's father, but I loved Olivia Wilde in this movie as Sabrina, the temptress who works with Mitch...I mean Dave (you know what I mean).

He's really vulgar and raunchy and it's just a lot of fun to watch him let loose instead of playing the straight man like always.

Body switching movies are supposed to have unbelievable premises but peeing in a fountain?!!? Poor Leslie Mann has to undergo every indignity a woman can - the farting scene is just gross. And, of course, we have to have the now-obligatory scene were liquid poop geysers out of the baby's rear 8 feet up in the air aat a 45 degree angle!

If you can believe that Olivia Wilde graduated law school at the top of her class and you think it's funny to see an 8-months pregnant nymphomaniac get made tro feel ashamed of herself, then this film is for you. And just for a total non-sequitur, out of left field, insensitive dropout and soft porn star Ryan Reynolds in Jason Bateman's body suddenly gets all sensitive about an anti-semitic remark (also totally out of cxontext) by Bateman's boss. Oh yeah, Alan Arkin (in a role that has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the gross-out movie) plays Reynolds Jewish father! It's a body-switching comedy - it's supposed to be unrealistic but so internally inconsistent? So gross, one after another, afcter another? The fabulously talented Ryan Reynolds should sue hisMann agent for this one. He is titally a fish out of the water. Leslie is married to Judd Apatow so I suppose she's used to the indignities - but she still deserves better. Jason Bateman still seems to be doing Arrested Development meets Couples Retreat so he's more at home in this dysfunctional movie than anyone else (except Craig Bierko in a hilarious soft porn sendup) but that's praising with faint damns.For me, it's the worst Hollywood-budget movie of the 21st century I've been subjected to thus far.",The Change-Up
62,RichardSRussell-1,Can Body-Switching Be Revived with Raunch?,5,15 August 2011,"The Change-Up (1:52, R) — fantasy: body switching, 2nd string, originalAt one time there were a couple of body-switching movies every year, but they've been thinning out lately, with Son of the Mask (2005), The Shaggy Dog (2006), and 17 Again (2009) being the most recent (unless you count 2008's Benjamin Button, which was a kinda, sorta example). So Producer-Director David Dobkin must have figured that what the subgenre needed was a good shot in the ... um, no, not arm, uh, mouth! Yeah, that's it, a shot in the mouth! With a nice, juicy jet of baby poo.Yes, this movie is R-rated. And not because, like its Chuckoid predecessors or the aspiring- to-respectability Fallen, it's loaded with graphic, gratuitous violence. No, THIS movie's R stands for repeated ribaldry and raunch. Fortunately, I have a high tolerance — if not an outright appreciation — for such fare. YMMV.To be fair, there are some quiet scenes, a few moments that verge on tender and sentimental, but they serve mainly as points of contrast.Jason Bateman plays Dave Lockwood, a steady, serious, hard-working guy, a successful lawyer, decent husband, and devoted father of a young girl and twin infants. He occasionally takes his nose off the grindstone long enuf to lament ""I missed all the sex and the drugs and the bad decisions.""Ryan Reynolds (on display elsewhere as Green Lantern) plays Mitch Planko, Dave's best bud since 2nd grade, who didn't miss ANY of that stuff. HIS problem is that he's adrift, aimless, unshaven, and unaccomplished. He looks at Dave's happy family and enviously remarks ""You're surrounded by people who give a sh¡t about you!"". (He isn't aware how literally true this is.)After a boys' night out, they're both tipsy and stop to take a leak into a huge ornamental stone fountain in a city park. While a dour marble goddess looks down on them in evident disapproval, they simultaneously blurt ""I wish I had your life."" As they zip up and walk away, we see she's now smiling. Next morning their wishes have come true.They fail to convince Dave's wife Jamie (Leslie Mann) of what's happened, so they decide to maintain the pretense until they can once again pee in the fountain to reverse the switch. This turns out to be harder than they expected, because it's being relocated and can't immediately be tracked down. So each gets to play the other for a few days.They start out not being very good at each others' jobs — or the rest of their lives, either — but then gradually start getting the hang of it. Not so much so that they want to STAY switched, of course, but they each learn something about the proper balance between seriousness and slackerdom.The script and pacing are uneven, and some of the situations are played overbroadly, which undercuts whatever sense of realism the completely unrealistic premise has tried to achieve for those who have willingly suspended their disbelief. It's impossible to believe, for instance, that even the fake Dave would behave so boorishly in the merger meeting or be so cavalier about babies playing with sharp kitchen instruments. And, despite the fact that every guy alive feels free to keep reading the menu after he's already ordered, the real Dave is such a straight arrow that even Olivia Wilde is unlikely to lure him into making sportive use of his friend Mitch's handy romantic equipment.The convention for such movies is that all personalities are returned to their rightful bodies in time for the denouement, during which all engage in saccharine bromides about how they've learned to appreciate what they have in life. So too here. In between there are enuf adventures and chuckles to keep you reasonably well entertained, as long as you aren't expecting Shakespeare. It aspires to be a comedy, and there are plenty of errors, but it's no Comedy of Errors.",The Change-Up
63,Bravesfan17,Well done buddy comedy,8,5 August 2011,"Director David Dobkin has done some pretty good comedies in the past that include Shanghai Knights, Wedding Crashers, and Fred Claus. Dobkin has followed those with his newest one, The Change-Up. Just like he did with Crashers and Claus, Dobkin introduces us to his main characters with a scene before showing us the title.In the opening scene, we meet Dave (Jason Bateman). Dave is a successful lawyer with a loving wife and three young kids. Dave has to wake up at three in the morning to get his kids to stop crying. We then meet his best friend Mitch (Reynolds), who is a big time slacker. Mitch doesn't have a stable job, hooks up with many ladies, and doesn't really care about his father, who is his only family.They both haven't seen each other in a while. One day, Mitch asks Dave to hang out at a bar with him, get a beer and watch the baseball game. They catch up on what is happening with each other and think that the other guy has the better life. They urinate in a fountain and say ""I wish I had your life."" A power outage happens right after they say it. The next morning, they both wake up and realize that they are in each other's bodies.Now Dave and Mitch must act as if they are still themselves even though they are not themselves. Bateman and Reynolds nail these roles very well as they show that they are not themselves. Both Bateman and Reynolds stand out as the two leads, especially when they have to act like each other. Some other key players includes Leslie Mann as Dave's wife, who has played a role like this many times before. An even better supporting player is Olivia Wilde as Sabrina, a young associate lawyer at the firm Dave works at who reluctantly agrees to go out with Mitch. She has some better moments as an actress.Like Crashers, Dobkin has made another good buddy comedy. He focuses the film on his two leading men and all the crazy shenanigans they go through together.Something else I liked about Dokin's film is that he puts a good message in them. In Crashers, his message is about the importance of friendship. In Claus, he has a message about doing what is right. With The Change-Up, he shows us that you really don't know what you have until it's gone.",The Change-Up

Jason Bateman plays the same character as he always does, which is something he does very well. Reynolds feels very plastic to me, like if he isn't really there, you know?Anyhow: Given the sad and woke excuses for movies we are getting these days I have given it 6/10: It is good for a few laughs and Jason Bateman alone is worth it.",The Change-Up
65,JimmyCollins,A funny gross out comedy that delivers laughs-a-plenty!,7,1 November 2011,"The body switch film is not a very original idea at all, there's been plenty in the past, It's A Boy Girl Thing, Freaky Friday and my personal fave, the Aussie classic Dating The Enemy, this however makes itself stand out from the crowd thanks to it's being a film solely aimed at adults. There's no way this movie is suitable for anyone under 14.Within the first 5 minutes I was laughing hysterically and that laughter continued pretty much all throughout the film with the exception of a few slow patches, it really is a great laugh riot. Ryan Reynolds returns to his comedy roots quite well and Jason Bateman is funnier in this than anything else I've seen him in. Olivia Wilde is OK as the bad girl but she's kinda unnecessary, Leslie Mann is great in all her type cast glory as the funny wife, I suppose you should do what you're good at and she certainly does. All the toilet humor in this movie is hilarious, I usually find that kind of humor cheap and lame but in this I thought it was hilarious, it's still gross but hey if it makes you laugh it does it's intended job. The only real downside to The Change Up is the side plot of Ryan Reynolds and his relationship with his father, it was kinda useless, and also the extremely long running time, in my opinion comedies shouldn't exceed the hour and a half mark and this film goes for close to 2 hours, that's far too long for this caliber of film but it kept delivering the laughs so I guess we can forgive that.There is a lot of fun to be had with The Change Up, just don't watch it if you're grossed out easily or expecting a truly amazing comedy, just take it for what it is which is a very entertaining adult comedy, with lots of gross out gags and plenty of laughs. Tis' a pretty rad movie.",The Change-Up
66,yongkang-27205,Kept me second guessing myself.,7,11 August 2021,"Truth be told, from the very beginning, I already expected the ending. I mean, for these kinds of body switch shows, what can you expect at the end? But surprisingly, I became increasingly doubtful about my guess as the film went on. And right before they revealed it, I really had no idea what to believe and expect anymore. I must say, in all its vulgar and raunchyness, it was well executed and a fun watch. It kind of gave me a Fundamentals of Caring vibe as both had that self revelation, pivotal life changing moments but Fundamentals was still a tad bit better. Overall, nothing life changing or special, but for a tried and tested formula, it was one of the better ones.",The Change-Up

For me the draw to this film was the two leads, Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds, and they both provided many funny moments between them and they showed brief glimpses of their talents, of which they have both gone on to showcase to greater effect. Two great actors imo. The film did have some forgettable moments and I certainly wouldn't say it is one of the best comedies I've seen, but like I mentioned earlier, still a good watchQuote - ""You ready to take a piss"" - Mitch Planko

The premise is about best friends Dave and Mitch, one a married lawyer and the other a playboy who does porn who envy each other's lives until one day they both pee in an Aphrodite fountain in a park and instantly swap bodies. Reynolds and Bateman are a great pairing as each other feed off one another and it's one issue after another. Alan Arkin is a supporting character and really appreciate the acting ability of Olivia Wilde's Sabrina character.

One thing though there were no actual real breasts on show it was all done with cgi. It didn't bother me, but i can see it could offend some people. I thought it was very funny in places, yes its been done before but lessons were learnt, they wanted each others lives but they had the best lives already it was right under their noses. Its really easy to take marriages for granted especially when one is working all the time, never forget to take the time to enjoy your families and instead of wanting someone elses life, make the best of your own and stop making excuses for your own failures. Some very funny moments, it is worth a watch i must admit i did laugh a lot especially with the babies had me in hysterics.Love Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds who had me in stitches. The second part is better and settles down and is not quite as coarse or rude as it settles down with the characters. I had never even heard of this movie until it popped up on my Amazon. Surprised it didn't do better to be honest.",The Change-Up
71,tecnogaming,A nice surprise with some minor downs,6,5 May 2012,"The premise of this movie has been done to hell and back, so, there is really not too much to add to this, two guys, one married and another single, one full of responsibilities and the other completely childish and sex addict, both best friends and a night of ""pee"" in the right fountain gets them a switch of bodies.The movie starts OK, really, with such a stereotypical premise there is nothing surprising, the married man is alright, the childish man is totally unbearable.Once the change up takes place, both had to endure their new lives and in the process they find each other and more Hollywood blah.The movie has nice comedy parts and some really gross moments, which is sad because the ending is about to change all that.If you see this movie from start to middle you will think this is a passable to mediocre movie, some gross jokes are barely watchable being ""the finger"" part one of the gross of all, I almost turn it off in that part.But suddenly, out of nowhere, in the last 30 minutes of movie, this all passable show become incredible hearth-warming and soft, it's like the director found it's way in the end and although cliché it just ends great.It's too sad that the gross parts will prevent this movie to be seen on a greater audience, and frankly, if not for the ending, they would be somehow justifiable because, well, this is raunchy comedy.The thing that really bothers me about this one is that the last 30 minutes are really great, a really feel-good moment and totally likable so, this last part changed the perspective of the whole movie (in a good way) and then, the raunchy parts becomes totally unnecessary.If they could just make a nice comedy the whole time instead of raunchy- dirty in the first and second act and super heart-warming on the last act this would be one of my favorites, but the mixing became somewhat wrong.Hapily, the best part is in the ending so we can forgive some of it's flaws.6 out of 10 Do not recommend seeing this with the family but it's OK for singles and couples although I will just skip the finger scene altogether.",The Change-Up
72,jasontheterrible,Why this was a huge bomb at the box office,1,14 June 2018,"With great stars and a terrific story ala Nicholas Cage's ""Family Man"" this should have been a mega hit, but Hollywood took a hard left turn in 2008 at the direct urging of Obama, who told them ""we want to make traditional Americans very uncomfortable with all of their beliefs."" At least that is what a Hollywood insider told me. The strategy is right out the Alinsky playbook to take down the middle class. Tear down all of their values to make them believe the country is no longer theirs so they give up. That is why we have the F bomb in every sentence virtually through the entire film even in front of the small children in the family. From there it just gets uglier. The strategy is the more we throw F bombs, lurid sex scenes, rap music, minorities smarter and superior in values and telling everyone what to do, the more we take the country to the hard left, and dispirit middle America. This could have been such a funny film because there are some great jokes but the F bombs are so gratuitous they become grating and distracting very early on. Then there are so many disgusting lines which are thrown in for shock value that what we have in the end is a box office bomb. Do you wonder why the worldwide BO was so much better? Because they do not translate the language the same so that the words carry the same crudeness and offensiveness. Foreign countries only get the jokes in a sanitized family friendly way, so audiences in other countries mostly loved it.",The Change-Up
73,jonnyhavey,Freaky Friday: Mindless Fun Finally,6,15 August 2011,"The summer of 2011 has been ruled by R-rated comedies loosely based on raunch with very rewarding stories (""Bridesmaids"" ""Paul"" ""Horrible Bosses""). Therefore, ""The Change-Up"" had a lot to live up to with Jason Bateman taking control of the comedy genre this year and Ryan Reynolds returning to his forte after ""The Green Lantern"" flop. With this being said, ""The Change-Up"" was the mindless, uninspired, fulfilled film of the summer, relying solely on going above and beyond the usual limits of blunt humor and rallying with a fulfilling emotional finish. This grownup application of the ""Freaky Friday"" phenomenon follows best friends Dave Lockwood (Bateman) and Mitch Planko (Reynolds) who have drifted apart over the years. Dave has always been a workaholic allowing him to become a rich successful lawyer with a beautiful wife, Jamie (Leslie Mann, ""Funny People""), and three kids. Mitch is the complete opposite with a very laid back life style as an aspiring actor who smokes weed and lives off one night stands. As the two reconnect with a night full of drinking and peeing in a fountain they wish that they had each other's lives. Nothing logical happens at this point as lightning strikes causing Dave and Mitch to experience the other's life. Starting with an hour of laugh out loud vulgar comedy and ending with an emotional wakeup call to what is important in life, the film is all over the place. However, everything seems to come together as Olivia Wilde (""Cowboys and Aliens"") tops this male-comedy flick off with some good old sexiness.Both Ryan Reynolds and Jason Bateman are outrageous with their portrayals of Mitch mixing cursing and sporadic randomness. The ridiculousness of Mitch is offset by calmer comedy found in Dave trying to find himself within his self-reliant role he is stuck in. This is offset even further by a very dramatic performance by Leslie Mann, who is legitimately, scarily and realistically good as a mother wanting her husband to give her attention. Lastly, Olivia Wilde deserves a nod for her satisfyingly sensual performance sexier than ever.Please prepare yourself and know what you are getting into when going to see this film. The R-rating is rightfully earned with crudity abound and some jokes based on sore subjects. This film is not for everybody and when it comes down to it, the film is all over the place. The film lacks some fluidity as the emotional ending is set up slowly within the extreme continuous comedy in a very predictable manner. Ultimately, neither the comedy routine nor the storyline brings anything fresh to the adult comedy genre making this film only average.A bellyful of laughs at the start, and an offbeat emotional conclusion awkwardly works in this late summer comedy even though we have seen all of this before and are better off hitting up the three aforementioned comedies for entertainment.",The Change-Up
74,Marc_Action,"Nothing New, But Bearable",4,28 December 2012,"Directed by David Dobkins, writers Jon Lucas and Scott Moore try to put a different spin on the old body-swap plot. Unfortunately, there's nothing new here to warrant another go at it.Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds star in this film about two childhood friends that as adults, live completely opposite lives. Dave (Bateman) is a smart, successful lawyer and responsible (if not a bit pretentious) family man, and Mitch (Reynolds) is a struggling actor living a carefree, bachelor's life to the 10th power.One night while returning from a ""guys night out"" at a bar the two wish they were living the life of the other while urinating in a (unbeknown to them) magic fountain in the city park. The next morning they wake up each in the other's body. The rest of the movie, as you might guess, finds the two chaotically trying to live each other's life until they can locate the fountain (which has been moved by the city) and take another leak.First off, I think a park fountain that grants wishes after one takes a leak in it is probably the most absurd premise behind a body-swap movie, and that's putting it nicely. Yet somehow Bateman and Reynolds make the film bearable (though Bateman is the stronger actor here).This was not as terrible of a movie as the low 4 stars indicate. The film delivers a few good laughs and as I stated the cast carries the movie. But for the most part the storyline, that hits every well-worn plot element of previous body-swap films with the precision of a Rolex, keeps this movie from being anything above average.There is a point in the movie where both men start to enjoy each others lives so much that when they do finally locate the fountain, they decide to stay in each others bodies for a little longer. This is where the story begins to get interesting. However, just when it appears these guys might actually never swap back into the right bodies, for the sake of a predictable plot, the writers have them make the switch. Oh how this movie would have been so much more interesting if it had ended with these guys never going back to their original bodies, and therefore, lives. Just think of the possibilities for how the plot could have developed. But we wouldn't want that though. Nope, not our writers using a tad of creativity and originality...",The Change-Up
75,treeskier802,"Atypical ""Switch"" Movie With Typical Results",4,12 August 2011,"Have you ever seen a really really good ""switch"" movie? You know the type; mother and daughter or father and son wish out loud that they wish they could be the other and then some lightning bolts flash and it miraculously happens. Vice-versa, Freaky Friday, and Like Father Like Son are a few examples. The difference with the Change Up is that instead of a father/son or mother/daughter switch we get two buddies to switch things up. One happens to be a single playboy type who doesn't hold a job and the other is a corporate lawyer with a wife and three kids. The similarities to the other switcharoo movies is that like the other once mentioned, this is a rather mediocre to poor film as well. Perhaps the best of this genre is the Rob Schneider film, The Hot Chick, where he a low-life crook who switches with a prom queen. I got to go to The Change Up for free, so it was no harm, no foul. My recommendation would be for you to wait until this movie comes out on DVD to see it rather than waste your money at the movies. Rating 4 of 10 stars and that is being kind because I'm a Jason Bateman fan.",The Change-Up
76,cadfile,The Change-Up: Excellent comedy for a frat-boy,6,29 October 2011,"I saw the previews for the movie ""The Change-Up"" and it drew my interest. From the director of ""Wedding Crashers"" and writers of ""The Hangover"" I thought how could I lose since I loved both those movies. While not a horrible film, it was not a ""Wedding Crashers"" or ""The Hangover"". To me it seemed like an extra long letter to ""Penthouse"" magazine - the kind of fiction a guy would dream up before getting married and having a family.I like crude humor. I've been known to indulge in it myself but the gross jokes for the sake of being gross is stupid. It was great when I was twelve - I mean it was fun trying to out gross my friends but if I'm paying $10 to see a film I expect a film for adults not 12 year olds. If you base your whole film on humor heard in 6th grade then you have some issues.F-bombs to or in front of children seems wrong no matter why it's being done and F-bombs just because you have an R-rated movie is stupid. Oh and I know there are filming tricks used so that they aren't really cursing in front of the children but it wasn't funny especially when the one older child didn't seem to respond to the words like a normal child would and neither did the parents.The male and female characters were flat stereotypes as if an immature frat-boy wrote them. The men were tough 'take-no-crap' men and the women were aggressive, pretty, and hardly reacted to the men being butt-heads. I was so disappointed that Leslie Mann and Olivia Wilde would demean themselves in this farce.My jaw dropped during the date scene between Ryan Reynolds and Olivia Wilde when his character asked her why she showed up and she said she showed up to keep her job???!!! Really? In 2011? I'm sorry I just didn't buy the premise. Wilde is not a bimbo and only a bimbo would still keep a date rather than going to HR to complain about her boss. This isn't the 1980's.These kind of 'B' movies would usually have a couple of hot up-and-coming starlets in those roles. I expected better from Mann and Wilde. Although I will say Leslie Mann did have a couple of decent scenes particularly the one where she is telling her whole life story to the babysitter - that was funny.The movie does try to redeem itself in the second half but by then I stopped caring and I'm sure the frat-boy audience did too.What I liked about ""Wedding Crashers"" and ""The Hangover"" that is missing from this film is more heart. Sure I can just sit back and not focus on the issues but this film wasted my time and the CGI nudity took away the only real reason to waste my $10.",The Change-Up

The Change-Up thankfully wasn't directed by Michael Bay and delivered a light-hearted bromance that rejigged the Freaky Friday formulae for older audiences.It has little of The Hangover Part II's laziness nor of Wedding Crashers lack of laughs and instead settles for something between the two. It borrows heavily from other body-switch comedies, presenting little that hasn't been seen before; the same life-reflecting nostalgia has been built in, as has the character's new found appreciation to predictable success. There are also worrying lulls in the humour, actually at one moment I realised I hadn't had an excuse to laugh for about twenty minutes but still, those were my only issues.Bateman and Reynolds are oddly suited as the hapless victims, while Leslie Mann actually gives a surprisingly poignant performance for a comedy. Poor Olivia Wilde was used, as she was in Tron: Legacy and Cowboys & Aliens, as nothing more than wasted eye-candy getting a minute amount of screen time. Still it has plenty of laughs, is refreshingly unannoying and isn't subtle about what to expect.",The Change-Up

82,TourettesPersonal,Humorous Crap,4,6 October 2011,"Body-switching movies are obviously not intriguing anymore. The Change-Up tries to be unique by putting adult humor. Unfortunately, most of its humor are not as mature as its contents. We often see poop, pee, and some boobs. Too much toilet humor made this film end up being childish. But there are some humor can be funny for some reason and well delivered by the cast. Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds saves the film but not mostly. The Change-Up is completely terrible without them but the film is still not good though.First of all, it wants to be a mature version of Freaky Friday. It throws a lot of profanity and boobs throughout. The huge misstep is adding too much toilet humor. Peeing at the fountain, Poop on the face, and Testicle jokes occasionally. Maybe a dirty minded kid might enjoy this. And too many slapstick humor. A baby hitting himself on a crib. But the only witty and hilarious humor here is the ""Dinner Song"". Most of its humor is dirty but the film is surprisingly wants to give a lot of heart to its story. Which is truly strange.Despite from its vulgarity and toilet humor, the movie can be fun by the performances of Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds. They are not the kind of people that you expect to switch bodies but they did their jobs well. Especially Bateman. He can play both hardworking father and a jerk slacker.Here's the tip of watching The Change-Up, watch it for the stars. The film is still pretty stupid and gross but at least it's not as bad as the last excessive vulgarity comedy ""Your Highness"". The Change-Up is dirty and childish. I guess the filmmakers are getting lazy. It's Freaky Friday with Crappy Humor (Literally).",The Change-Up

I've watched a lot of the other bodies-were-exchanged sort of movies and yet the Change-Up has something new and refreshing to offer. A warning though, if you get easily offended or grossed out, sit this one out. Overall, the movie isn't just funny, there's also a storyline you can follow and enjoy. It's heartwarming and disgusting at the same time, a very unique combination. I would have added a star if it ended a bit earlier since it felt like the movie was dragging at parts just to drive home the message.It almost feels like Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds are playing themselves/every other character they always play so it isn't a surprise when they carry these roles with ease.

The director and cast keep the scenes moving so well that you follow the unfolding drama intently while laughing, sighing, blushing, gagging and gasping.So if you are looking for some gut-busting adult time with close friends or receptive significant other, then this movie will not disappoint.

I highly recommend it, you'll might hear cussing lots of times, you'll might experience lots of highly raunchy jokes, but well, you'll just see yourself laughing like a maniac and having an excellent time. Now, let me tell you something, I'm honestly a person with a great taste for movies and I have a very reasonable list of favorite movies, not only by my point of view and even though I think this decision might not have been that reasonable for everyone, I just have no doubts that The Change-Up is my 4th favorite movies, I mean, I had an excellent time, I was highly entertaining and I loved everything about it, how could I possibly not give it a lower rate than 10?Dave (Jason Bateman) is a successful married and a three-son fathered lawyer. Mitch (Ryan Reynolds), well, he's the opposite, he's a useless guy that just likes to get high, get laid, stay at home and only working on useless commercials or 'lornos'. Dave and Mitch were best pals during a long time but time has separate them away. One day, they decide to meet each other again at a bar. In one night where everything was supposed to be like a reunion of best friends drinking some beers, turned into a night where they both mention that they envy each other's life and when they decide to pee at a fountain, wishing to have each other's life, next thing they know is seeing themselves waking up in each others body. Who says men can't change?Body-switch script, who cares? Yes, it has been used, but well, I think it was an amazing plot with hilarious details and characters that make us forget about how stupid body-switch is. I loved this plot and I think it was hilarious and amazingly written, it highly surpasses Freaky Friday's plot.David Dobkin (Wedding Crashers) did a great job and I'm glad he took this plot and he just went for it. Jason Bateman (Horrible Bosses) was fantastic, I always found him really funny and an amazing actor, but here, they tested how far he could go and oh boy, he went too far, Jason was freaking hilarious, he played two characters and he did a terrific job, he was raunchy, very raunchy indeed, but he was hilarious and I completely loved his performance, his amazing performance. Ryan Reynolds was fantastic as well, he was hilarious and this was definitely the best role of his entire career, I loved his hilarious raunchy performance, Ryan, let me give you a piece of advice, forget Green Lanter, stick to these kinds of comedies, that's what you're amazing at. Sow, the two central amazing performances by Jason and Ryan are really the ones that stand out, but there was also some solid performances by the rest of the cast, completed by Leslie Mann, Olivia Wilde and Alan Arkin.Sow, ignore the idiotic reviews about this movie, this movie isn't bad at all, I highly recommend and it's the best comedy I've seen since Horrible Bosses, it's smart, it's raunchy, it's hilarious, it's fun, it's entertaining, it's well-acted and it's hilarious, there's nothing like The Change-Up, forget the teen comedy Freaky Friday and stick to the adult R rated comedy The Change-Up, which is completely worth being watched and I'll watch it much more times. Watch it if you haven't, it has everything an amazing comedy needs, I highly recommend it and I highly recommend it. I think the reviewers only wanted to play smart guys, I'm sure they liked something, cause from what I've seen, what's there not to like? I'm sure they've watched a different version, cause this movie has no flaw, it's flawless, it's perfect, it's my 4th favorite movie.Mitch's Dad: I'm getting married again and I'd like you to come to the wedding. Mitch: When's the wedding? Mitch's Dad: Next Saturday. My betrothed, Pamela, would like you to be there to say a few words. Mitch: I'll catch the next one...",The Change-Up

That being said, it still confounds me that anyone with eyes and ears that function nominally could give this movie 10 stars. People, 10 stars means it is among the very best movies you have ever seen, and that is something this movie is not. It's also not among the very worst movies I've ever seen, because I have watched many SyFy Channel movies, and those are among the worst movies. Please people, for the love of reasonableness, use the 10 stars and 1 star rating for the best and worst movies ever.As for The Change-up, based on the actors and the well known story, I was expecting a bit more than I got. It had a few high points, but I think the lows were more disappointing than the highs were satisfying. I wasn't expecting a great movie, but I'd hoped for better than this. The movie is watchable, but there a few parts that had they been edited out, or shot differently, this would have been a more satisfying movie. Worth watching if you have a couple of hours to kill, but set your expectations solidly in the average to below average range before pressing play.",The Change-Up

92,omarh92,Defiantly not a cliché and unique for it's style,8,21 October 2011,"This movie certainly is the full works, Ryan Reynolds, Jason Bateman, Leslie Mann and Olivia Wilde. All did phenomenon on their characters; being funny, loving, touching the crowds hearts, amusing them in every way possible. Many movies had the same same idea, 2 people switching bodies and they go through each others daily tasks and life. We have the same idea here but much more on detail on the daily life part, that is because it's not just daily life we are shown here we also see life turning or changing events a normal person must go through as well. What was also great about this movie was not just the amount of details shown on the daily life part but also how Ryan Reynolds did great playing Jason Bateman's character and Bateman doing the very same for Reynolds' character, the writer really did write the story and script for this indeed carefully. This is my favorite comedy of this year for sure. Usually when you enter a great movie, you feel like it passed by soo fast but this actually feels like a long 2 hours movie, which is enjoyable.",The Change-Up
93,neji107,"A raunchy comedy with flawed humor, but commendable acting",4,19 July 2011,"Dave (Bateman) and Mitch (Reynolds) envy each other's lives. To Mitch, Dave leads a successful and contented life, working at a prestigious law firm and surrounded by a loving family. To Dave, Mitch is living the dream: a stress and commitment-free joyride full of drugs, booze, and strange new women. After the childhood friends reunite at a bar, they decide to pee into a fountain while simultaneously wishing for the other's life. Naturally, the act causes them to magically switch bodies the next morning. It then becomes a race against time to find the same fountain and reverse the effects before their respective lives are ruined for good. However, as the hunt continues, Dave and Mitch discover that even though the other's life is not as dreamy as they had initially imagined, seeing things from a new perspective reveals what they had overlooked in their own.So after a drunken night, a couple of men wake up to a disaster and ""proceed to freak the ---- out"". Sound familiar? Yes, The Change-up features the same writers as from The Hangover, and like its spiritual predecessor, gleefully abuses its right to a hard R-rating. The movie jumps at every chance to spew out foul language and full frontal nudity. But around every corner comes the awful toilet humor. (Literally.) Without fail each joke is followed up by a string of curse words or disgusting crude humor. Clearly, The Change-Up relies heavily on shock value to produce some cheap laughs, but this is to be expected of The Hangover's creative minds. Unfortunately, what worked for The Hangover does not always work here. This kind of humor fit The Hangover perfectly simply because the movie had a persisting theme of ridiculousness and never took itself too seriously. On the other hand, in its latter half The Change-Up tends to lean toward its dramatic side and realizes too late that crude jokes have begun to feel out of place.Even so, none of the comedic parts of this film would fly without the talent of its lead actors. The weight of the movie relies on Reynolds and Bateman's ability to portray ""each other"", and without drawing attention to the fact; they deliver quite nicely. The personality swap between professional lawyer and immature jock is seamless and remains successfully low-key for the duration of the film. Since the switched personalities represent the most interesting parts, though, the movie lags immensely in the beginning and end. Olivia Wilde and Leslie Mann are fine playing the tempting secretary/wife, but regrettably do not serve much more of a purpose in the movie after their clothes come off.The Change-Up is a raunchy comedy that follows in the footsteps of the more worthy 'The Hangover'. Complete with wildly annoying infants, incidents involving diarrhea, and adventures in the 'lorn' industry, it is a shock-and-show roller-coaster. Entertaining, perhaps but just be aware of what you're walking in to. 6/10",The Change-Up

The different lifestyles of the friends works well for this movie as did ""It's A Boy Girl Thing"" with mixing the sexes. The best part is understanding what the person who switched lives with you actually has to deal with in life; it's another hard lesson in life, but necessary for stubborn humans who only see themselves. It's a great lesson for movies, it's just been done so many times before. This movie is worth watching because of its creativity.",The Change-Up
98,carry-92,Story seen before? Not like this!,9,12 October 2011,"I wasn't sure whether to watch this movie or not. It seemed medium good and you might think this is some ""all been seen before"" movie. But from what I can say it's definitely not. Only the main story is about the whole change up thing as in similar movies like ""Freaky Friday"". Most of these movies are about a mother and a daughter though. This one is about 2 good friends who have known each other for a long time but are yet completely different. One is the family guy, 3 kids, a wife, a house, a job as a lawyer. He got everything he ever could dream of. The other guy is nothing like this. No girlfriend, just affairs, a single apartment, he's still kind of a boy inside. When they get changed-up it's a total chaos! How should a single guy know how to take care of a whole family with 2 little babies? How is he supposed to know how to be a lawyer? Really funny moments there. The other one doesn't know anything about being single. Even though they both wanted this life they see how much it sucks for them. They step from one mistake to another and can't manage to do anything right at the beginning. And they also find out things about each other they never knew and things about themselves. All this in a really funny way. Only thing I didn't like was that the movie seemed to be endless. I felt like I spent 4 hours watching it cause some scenes might have been a little long. I wouldn't take out anything for the story nor the laughs though, so just -1 point for this.",The Change-Up
99,sehook7,Overdone,6,31 October 2012,"There is nothing original about The Change-Up. The plot line of two people switching bodies in order to appreciate their own lives has been done more times than I can count. In fact, I think this is a storyline that has been done more than any other, and certainly more than it should.Luckily for the Change-Up it had Ryan Reynolds, Jason Bateman, Leslie Mann, and Olivia Wilde. The first half of this movie was slow and didn't show much promise. Fortunately, the movie did get better with the second half being much stronger.I was somewhat surprised with how much I enjoyed this movie given its lack of originality and somewhat crude humor. This flick certainly wasn't any of these actor's best work, but I am glad I rented it. It was worth the rental, and not completely disappointing.",The Change-Up

Or at least it feels like it because it has been done so often. Remember Tom Hanks in BIG? And the Jennifer Garner one?Interesting trivia too is the fact that there is no real nudity - all is computer generated or with body doubles or prosthetics.

Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds manage to make the ""change-up"" so completely real that you even begin to buy into the theme behind the plot (Mitch's growing up/Dave's becoming more appreciative of wife and family). I saw the R-rated moments for what they are--Adult! And those ironic moments where the inhabited character reacts so differently (Cara's ballet sequence is hilarious) propel the comedy to another level. The supporting cast is just as talented, Leslie Mann, Olivia Wilde, and Alan Arkin all have sterling moments!One can argue thematic lessons here, but this film is filled with sharp, funny dialogue and produces a satisfying ending.

Someone wrote that this is adult humor? Adult? Humor? Stupid, stupid film.

It's the standard fare for a body switching movie. Two people are unhappy or unfulfilled with their lives and wish they could switch with someone else. The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence type of thing. Then *gasp* some magic happens and they actually do get to switch bodies. What happens then is they both struggle with each others lives, then start to love it, then pine for their old lives back when they learn the lesson that their lives weren't so bad after all and they should count their blessings and be happy blah, blah, blah. Like I said, we've all seen this movie before. So why do I give it the high rating of 8/10? Well, that's simple, because we've all seen this movie before and we know what's going to happen even before we've seen even the trailer, the thing you have to ask yourself is: is it funny? The long answer to that is yes it is, very funny and each of the cast is brilliant in their respective roles.

107,PanTonowicZ,Cliché cliché cliché,3,29 October 2011,"We've all seen it. Hollywood frequently come back to the paradigm of changing bodies(or places). Background changed up a little bit in The change up but its still a cliché. Humour is very low and first few seconds of the movie explains it very vividly but if you ll manage to look pass it ll get better. I personally liked scenes with Olivia Wild she has really strong screen presence (or maybe its just because she so damn HOT). Anyway there will be few laughs and few WTF. Although film is predictable and starts off awfully I must say its one of few that I liked among 'OMG we changed our bodies' clichés.The story is about 2best friends Dave Lockwood(Jason Bateman) and Mitch Planko (Ryan Reynolds) which after drunken night change up their bodies. That of course lead to awkward situations, gags and rediscovering your own I. Dave is a lawyer with 3 kids and loving wife.Mitch is completely different person without career, living like a men-child and chasing skirt all the time (he also had daddy issues). Jason Bateman as an actor (and probably as a person) completely lacks charisma so he s tailor made for role of Dave. (btw he always play the same guy). The thing is that after the ""change"" it just doesn't work any more. As douche he cant convey anything beside few facial expressions. Same goes for Reynolds although he doesn't act he just looks pretty. But who da hell cares about acting while watching light and for most parts brain-dead comedy.I recommend it to all those who have not much experience with cinema. If want to have some fun and leave cinema rather with a smile then without this is for you. For the rest of us it will work only when we're sad at the moment with out anything better to do.

While taking a lengthy urination into a public fountain, the cement goddess of the fountain decides to change their brains and bodies.My first impression of this movie was that the acting was pathetically poor. After watching further it occurred to me that the storyline is so absurd that no actor could possibly get a grip on it. The movie attempts make up for the stupid acting and storyline with massive pornography and foul language. I am no prude. I enjoy some good raunchy humor as much as anyone, but after about 45 minutes of this movie I was grossed out. I think the final straw was when Ryan repeatedly dropped F bombs on the cute little 6 year old girl in the car. My standards of decency may be pretty loose, but this was too much for me. I very rarely fail to finish a movie, but I flushed this piece of excrement, and saved 30 minutes of torture. I found very little humor in this movie.I can't imagine what kind of parents would allow their child to be subjected to such filth in making a movie.

Of course, this is the type of film better seen with a filled theater.Of course it's a hard 'R' for vulgarity, nudity, and everything you expect in a sex-themed comedy. The trailers don't shy away from that.One always expects great comedic timing from the likes of Reynolds and Bateman. However, in these roles they truly do something different. Bateman gets to be the raunchy one. He finally gets to let loose. Reynolds holds back as the straight-laced guy who's more of a thinker.Leslie Mann was the true surprise in the film. I hope Judd Apatow watches this ""The Change-Up"" and realizes one thing; THIS is how you write for/use your wife in your films. Leslie can act! She takes the otherwise tiresome 'wife' role and turns it into something a little deeper.Olivia Wilde plays the unfortunate part of 'that girl.' She's not there to serve much purpose throughout the flick, but her story is summed up nicely. But sweet merciful GOD does she look fantastic with very dark hair! Anyway, it's a great flick. I suggest you go see it, you'll enjoy it. It's not your typical ""body swap"" movie (ala ""Freaky Friday,"" ""Vice Versa,"" ""Like Father, Like Son."") plus I believe it has more heart than any of those three.",The Change-Up

I know I'm pretty late having seen this movie last week, but I hadn't even known it existed prior to watching a trailer on Youtube.When the second line of the film is a 'f-bomb', I knew I was in trouble. Don't get me wrong. There are times I've been known to swear like a sailor, but this movie went way too overboard. Almost every other line had multiple curses, distracting from whatever piece of the flimsy plot remained.The jokes were overused, repeated, and not funny at all. Combining that with the fact that they seemed to deliberately lose the plot, I wish I when I had paused the movie to go to the restroom, I had actually just shut it off.This movie had an amazing cast, but with the absolutely heartstopping bad script, it had no chance. The fact that there were small children in some of the most ludicrous scenes makes me want to punch the face of everyone who allowed it.If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and don't.

129,iamentertainer,Everything new is well forgotten old,7,13 November 2011,"Everything new is well forgotten old. Screenplay writers in Hollywood are quite lazy to invent new stories and that's why for not working hard they just took an old idea and prescribed new fresh modern jokes. This film is about the exchange of bodies. Russians create 3 or 4 such films already, and in we also can find dozen of such comedies. It can be changing the bodies of human-being and animal; man and woman; young and old (actually this one I remember bout clanging 18-year-old and 81-year-old grandfather - I liked it). This time everything is easier - We have 2 friends. One is a successful lawyer with his wife, home and family and his classmate-reveler-Boy, who lives the way he wants: drugs, cars, alcohol, girls. Everyone can imagine how many jokes can one place in such a situation, but this is Hollywood and there even some moral lessons are noticed. Although real worth seeing episode is only the very beginning the film and Olivia Wilde without clothing and in the performance of tattoos on her genitals. If an episode of her boobs is real (they did not show her head, she is nice nice nice! Overall: funny and if you also now have the kids of pampers-age, it will be funny in a few more times cause you can find yourself out there.",The Change-Up

The super successful businessman (Jason Batemam) who is actually (Ryan Reynolds) wins some mediation with all of his privileged old white coworkers win 720 million from a group of (I believe Japanese lawyers). Then the laid back immature cool dude (Ryan Reynolds) who is actually played by (Jason Bateman) gets to bang the hottest women in the entire movie but (JB) can't cheat on his wife so leaves.

Its certainly not great but its not too bad, Ryan Reynolds and Jason Bateman bring a lot of charisma and charm to this movie. They bring you into the other persons life from two completely different sides of lifestyle. Ryan Reynolds plays a character from the perspective of someone who does not care and is free to do what ever he wants. However he doesn't have much to live for and he feels as if none cares about him. Jason Batemen plays the character of a man who is worked his way from the working class to the upper class from straight hard work. However his character is married and is quite stressted out and is unable to be free to do what he wants and is often stressted alot. Once they switch bodies their lifestyle changes. This movie does have a few ""gross"" scenes and a lot of nudity portrayed in a hilarious and funny way. Mitch's reactions to Daves life were some of the funniest bits in my opinion. This movie warms your heart in some scenes especially when Dave starts to enjoy Mitch's life. The ending of the movie left me feeling good.I give this a 6/10.",The Change-Up

I am astonished it even has a 6.2 as of now. In my opinion it should have a 5 and that is being generous. I hated everything about this movie. I didn't believe one word of this movie. It is becoming clear Ryan Reynold should stick to what he's ""good"" at. He is a box office failure this summer. The only thing he seems to be successful at is mediocre rom coms. Jason Bateman has been making some bad career moves as well these last few years. From The Switch..to Horrible Bosses(which was not as bad as this movie but still a disappointment) and now he can add the change up to his declining filmography. The only redeeming quality this movie has is the graceful Leslie Mann. She is great here at the emotional scenes like in Funny People, but you can tell the whole times she knows she can do better than this. I can honestly say I did not laugh the entire movie. It is a non deserved R rated version of Freaky Friday. In fact, I am confident in saying that I enjoyed the Lindsay Lohan/Jamie Lee Curtis Freaky Friday movie much more than this.",The Change-Up

I have seen other movies with a similar premise, and expected a light, enjoyable, pleasant movie. So, I tried it. ""The Change-Up"" was hugely disappointing. This film is offensive, crude, boring, and intolerable.

135,iheartgators,Fun Flick Without Pretense.,8,10 September 2011,"I saw this film in the theaters and enjoyed it enough to write this review (which is my first on IMDb). Crass humor, sappy storyline, nothing exceptional to say the least . . . But, I loved it! If the humor wasn't so rude and the characters not so insensitive and shallow, I probably wouldn't have enjoyed this movie as much as I did. Half the fun was in watching these fellas on screen saying and doing stuff we wouldn't dream of doing in real life for fear of offending others or making fools of ourselves. Some scenes would have me squirming in awkward jaw-dropped discomfort while inwardly savoring the moment with a vicarious thrill.The lead actors, Jason Bateman & Ryan Reynolds, are also what made this film work as well as it did. They both brought their own particular brand of funny to the table and played off of each other quite well (Bateman reminded me slightly of his Michael Bluth character in Arrested Development, mildly stuffy, uppity and wound up tight; while Reynolds' character was vaguely dry, arrogant and tactlessly self-involved) I really enjoyed watching our lead protagonists switch roles and play as each other with believably unaffected skill.While not of great substance or profound moral quality (Who cares! That's not why I'm watching a feel-good Saturday-night comedy anyway), the characters and the movie as a whole really endears itself to the audience. I walked away from the film with a smile (possibly smirk) on my face and a little lightness to my step. It's kind of like Freaky Friday with a mid-life crisis and we learn that yeah, the grass is always greener and even 30-something jerks can be lovably perfect just the way they are.",The Change-Up

Jason Bateman is absolutely hilarious, he goes 100% the other way (he's more credible as the immature loser that has the hots for his best friend's wife) and Reynolds does the opposite of what he's been doing for some time now, the immature jerk who is forced to grow up very quickly (Green Lantern, Definitely, Maybe).

It had its funny parts, but I personally left the cinema annoyed. I heard most people calling it ""average"" while thinking to myself the reasons why... So first of all, why would I want to see this kind of concept AGAIN, and pay for it, when it was nothing special or innovative? Why so much nudity - why is it a TOTAL boob show?

That Jason Bateman's character got dumped upon by his infant child was one of the most gross things I've ever seen and should have been a warning to me that things would only get worse. I hoped otherwise, but was seriously disappointed from that point on. 'F' bombs were the norm; in point of fact, it seemed no character could complete a sentence without dropping one of those 'f' bombs or some variation thereof. Also, why was it necessary to prolong the urination scene? The movie's plot (if there was one) hinged upon the switch, but the point could easily have been made without the woefully offensive and overly long duration. When Bateman's character went to pick up his daughter (after the switch) and afterwards talked to his daughter about the ""whore"" the other little girl was...well, I had enough. I realize these people are actors (or are allegedly so) and that what they're saying are just part of the script, but the writer obviously had no qualms about putting an innocent little girl in such an obscene take. Moreover, the soft porn (is there such a thing????) session of Ryan Reynolds character was, simply, terrible and gratuitous...it had absolutely nothing to do with the movie at all. And it wasn't even remotely funny. I turned the movie off as it had gone off the deep end. I plan to voice my objection with the studio and any executive of the studio I can. This was an absolutely horrid movie. No plot. No character development. In fact, if the 'f' bombs were taken out of the script, the characters would have had little to say.

157,goodnames,Foul mouthed version of Freaky Friday,1,21 December 2012,"Well, the cast looks good enough, and it bills itself as a comedy. However, for some reason, Hollywood still hasn't received the message that not EVERY person wants to hear a never-ending bombardment of foul language. Am I a prude? Nope. But if you took out ""f#@$"" (rhymes with ""luck"") out of the script, the movie would be maybe 15 minutes long. It was with great disappointment that only 40 minutes into it, we could no longer stand to listen to it. The humor was often gross-out humor, like the father getting feces in his mouth from changing the baby's diaper, peeing in a public fountain, and other ""high-end"" stuff like that. I found myself going fairly quickly from looking forward to the comedy (misnamed, for sure) to being uncomfortable, to being completely repulsed. The premise is cute enough, if not already overused. Two friends end up wishing they had each other's lives, and while peeing in the fountain, some sort of power outage occurs, and they wake up the next morning in each other's bodies. Freaky Friday all over again, but without the humor and without the class. The addition of the language just puts it into a category all by itself. There's no need at all for the quantity of it - a few times, maybe. But it is E-N-D-L-E- S-S. There are plenty of nude scenes in there too, since one friend is supposedly an actor in the porn industry. I am sure you can grasp all the fun they have with that one. If you are 15 and find offensive language really funny, or you just have almost no vocabulary and don't realize there are lots of other words out there, then you might like this movie. If, however, you are an adult and have an IQ over 70, then you'll want to keep on looking. It isn't funny, despite a decent cast. It's just obnoxious and hard to listen to. As I type this, I have the sound off with closed caption, which unfortunately still shows the real dialog - it never ends. There are some scenes that are just trashy, and ""R"" is definitely the correct rating for this one. The cast should be ashamed of this one, and want it removed from their resume.Do yourself and your ears a favor and don't bother. Just hit your thumb with a hammer, let it fly, and you'll have had just as entertaining a time as this movie offers, and neither the foul language nor the pain will last nearly as long.",The Change-Up

He gets an opportunity to have sex with a nymphomaniac type lady during the switch, but wouldn't because she was pregnant ::drum cymbals:: However, he gets redemption by having a brief emotional affair with his hot assistant. In a twist of fate, when he sees the assistant's boobies, he becomes enlightened like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" style. What great news for the wife!",The Change-Up
159,janusniq,If you like comedies and have a little time to kill - this is a good choice,6,24 August 2014,"I like the idea of this movie, the casting is great and everybody is doing his/her job. I had few laughs and as I have written above, if you like comedies and have some time to kill, this is a good choice.However, I think that they could have played a little bit more with the script. At the beginning, we are ""told"" that Mitch's life is great and Dave's not so much. Of course, a viewer with an average intelligence knows that things are not always as they seem. However, I think that in the end Mitch's life was portrayed really negatively and all perks and good moments in the ""Mitch's body"" had to be created by Dave himself. What I mean is that writers could have maybe worked a little bit more on Mitch's character.",The Change-Up
160,americangirlinuk,really funny,10,7 November 2014,"Love this movie! Just wanted to say to the people writing reviews, his name is Jason Bateman, not Justin!! Really?? Buy it, you'll love it. Jason and Ryan are great and work together so well. I haven't seen the theatrical version, just the unrated so can't compare, but loved it. There is a lot of potty mouth in this movie, but I think it added to the hilarity and wouldn't have been the same without it, but may offend some I suppose. I'm so not easily offended so I was crackin up. I've never left a movie review before, but the people leaving a review without getting the main actors name right really irritated me. If you are going to take the time to write a review and give credit to a talented actor at least get the name right. How offensive to get Jason's name wrong!",The Change-Up

It is always important to take a look at our life from a different POV to know the good stuffs in out life.",The Change-Up
